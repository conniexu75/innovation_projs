Here we show that NAD+ depletion and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) are sequential and necessary steps in PARP-1-mediated cell death. Cultured mouse astrocytes were treated with the cytotoxic concentrations of N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or 3-morpholinosydnonimine to induce DNA damage and PARP-1 activation. The resulting cell death was preceded by NAD+ depletion, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and MPT. Sub-micromolar concentrations of cyclosporin A blocked MPT and cell death, suggesting that MPT is a necessary step linking PARP-1 activation to cell death. In astrocytes, extracellular NAD+ can raise intracellular NAD+ concentrations. To determine whether NAD+ depletion is necessary for PARP-1-induced MPT, NAD+ was restored to near-normal levels after PARP-1 activation. Restoration of NAD+ enabled the recovery of mitochondrial membrane potential and blocked both MPT and cell death. Furthermore, both cyclosporin A and NAD+ blocked translocation of the apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria to nuclei, a step previously shown necessary for PARP-1-induced cell death. These results suggest that NAD+ depletion and MPT are necessary intermediary steps linking PARP-1 activation to AIF translocation and cell death.

PARP-1 utilizes NAD+ to form poly(ADP-ribose) polymers on specific acceptor proteins. PARP-1 activation appears to facilitate DNA repair under moderate stress conditions (3de Murcia G. Schreiber V. Molinete M. Saulier B. Poch O. Masson M. Niedergang C. Menissier de Murcia J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 15-24Google Scholar), but extensive PARP-1 activation promotes cell death under conditions that cause extensive DNA damage such as excitotoxicity and ischemia (2Virag L. Szabo C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 375-429Google Scholar, 4Szabo C. Dawson V.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 287-298Google Scholar). Both genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of PARP-1 activity can markedly reduce cell death under these conditions (5Zhang J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Science. 1994; 263: 687-689Google Scholar, 6Eliasson M.J. Sampei K. Mandir A.S. Hurn P.D. Traystman R.J. Bao J. Pieper A. Wang Z.Q. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Dawson V.L. Nat.

The sequence of events leading from PARP-1 activation to cell death has not been fully established. PARP-1-mediated cell death is caspase-independent, lacks many morphological hallmarks of classical apoptosis, and was long considered a direct result of energy failure (5Zhang J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Science. 1994; 263: 687-689Google Scholar, 8Berger N.A. Radiat. Res. 1985; 101: 4-15Google Scholar, 9Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13978-13982Google Scholar). Extensive PARP-1 activation causes NAD+ depletion, which, in turn, can lead to ATP depletion (5Zhang J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Science. 1994; 263: 687-689Google Scholar, 8Berger N.A. Radiat. Res. 1985; 101: 4-15Google Scholar, 10Ying W. Chen Y. Alano C.C. Swanson R.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 774-779Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown that translocation of the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to the nucleus is required for PARP-1-mediated cell death (11Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Google Scholar). Thus, a fundamental unanswered question is whether NAD+ depletion is a necessary and causal event in PARP-1-mediated cell death, and, if so, what is the link between NAD+ depletion and mitochondrial release of AIF. Mitochondria permeability transition (MPT), like PARP-1 activation, is a significant factor leading to cell death after excitotoxicity, ischemia-reperfusion, and other disorders (12Alano C.C. Beutner G. Dirksen R.T. Gross R.A. Sheu S.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 531-538Google Scholar, 13Friberg H. Wieloch T. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 241-250Google Scholar). MPT results from the opening of a large conductance channel in the inner mitochondrial membrane (14Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Google Scholar, 15Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Google Scholar). Pharmacological inhibition of MPT with cyclosporin A (CsA) has been shown to prevent neuronal death after oxygen/glucose deprivation in vitro (16Khaspekov L. Friberg H. Halestrap A. Viktorov I. Wieloch T. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3194-3198Google Scholar) and after ischemia or severe hypoglycemia in vivo (17Uchino H. Elmer E. Uchino K. Li P.A. He Q.P. Smith M.L. Siesjo B.K. Brain Res. 1998; 812: 216-226Google Scholar, 18Li P.A. Kristian T. He Q.P. Siesjo B.K. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 165: 153-163Google Scholar, 19Ferrand-Drake M. Friberg H. Wieloch T. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 1325-1338Google Scholar). MPT has also been shown to initiate nuclear apoptotic changes in a cell-free system (20Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Gomez-Monterrey I. Castedo M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1533-1544Google Scholar) and is associated with the release of AIF in intact cells (21Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Daugas E. Wang H.G. Geley S. Fassy F. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 25-37Google Scholar, 22Cai J. Yang J. Jones D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 139-149Google Scholar, 23Larochette N. Decaudin D. Jacotot E. Brenner C. Marzo I. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Xie Z. Reed J. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 413-421Google Scholar). These findings suggest a potential mechanism for interplay between the cell death processes induced by PARP-1 and MPT. Here we examined the relationships between PARP-1 activation, NAD+ depletion, MPT, and AIF translocation using primary astrocyte cultures. This primary culture preparation has proven useful for the study of PARP-1 cytotoxicity. Particularly important for the present study is that astrocytes permit passive transmembrane NAD+ influx through connexin hemichannels (24Verderio C. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Fedele E. Schenk U. De Flora A. Matteoli M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 646-657Google Scholar, 25Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Google Scholar, 26Ying W. Garnier P. Swanson R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 809-813Google Scholar). This permits experimental control over intracellular NAD+ concentrations after PARP-1 activation. The results of these studies suggest that both NAD+ depletion and MPT are necessary intermediary steps in the cell death program leading from PARP-1 activation to AIF release and cell death. Chemicals and reagents for experiments were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich except where otherwise noted. Astrocyte Cultures—Astrocyte cultures were prepared from cerebral cortices of wild type (WT) or PARP-1-/- mice, as described previously (10Ying W. Chen Y. Alano C.C. Swanson R.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 774-779Google Scholar), in accordance with a protocol approved by the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center animal studies committee. WT mice were Swiss-Webster strain obtained from Simonsen (Gilroy, CA). The PARP-1-/- mice were the 29 S Adprt1tm1Zqw strain obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and originally developed by Z. Q. Wang (27Wang Z.Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Google Scholar). In brief, the cortices were harvested, freed of meninges, dissociated with papain digestion (with DNase) and subsequent trituration, and plated on 24-well Falcon culture plates or glass coverslips. Cells were treated for 48 h with 20 μm cytosine arabinoside at confluence (12–15 days in vitro) to prevent microglial proliferation. This medium was replaced with Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, 100 nm sodium selenate, and 200 nm α-tocopherol. The astrocyte cultures were used, when confluent, at 20 to 30 days in vitro. At this age, any neurons that had been present in the initial plating have been killed by glutamate in the feeding medium (28Ye Z.C. Sontheimer H. Glia. 1998; 22: 237-248Google Scholar). The cultures contain >95% astrocytes and <5% microglia (29Duan S. Anderson C.M. Keung E.C. Chen Y. Swanson R.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1320-1328Google Scholar,30Chen Y. Vartiainen N.E. Ying W. Chan P.H. Koistinaho J. Swanson R.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1601-1610Google Scholar). Experimental Procedures—Experiments were initiated by replacing the culture medium with a balanced salt solution (BSS) containing 3.1 mm KCl, 134 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.25 mm KH2PO4, 15.7 mm NaHCO3, and 2 mm glucose. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 while the solution was equilibrated with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Osmolarity was verified at 280–320 mosmol with a Wescor vapor pressure osmometer (Logan, UT). Drugs were added from concentrated stocks prepared in BSS immediately before use and adjusted to pH 7.2 when necessary. Exposures to N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) or 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) were performed at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Benzamide, 3,4-dihydro-5-[4-(1-piperidinyl)butoxy]-1(2H)-isoquinolinone (DPQ; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), CsA (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), and FK506 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) were added at least 30 min prior to the addition of MNNG or SIN-1. Incubations were 30 min for MNNG (except where noted) or 60 min for SIN-1 and were terminated by washing and complete medium exchange. CsA and FK506 were re-added after the medium exchange. NAD+ was added only after medium exchange. Except where noted, the drugs were used at the following concentrations: 100 μm MNNG; 5 mm SIN-1; 1 mm benzamide; 25 μm DPQ; 200 nm CsA; 1 μm FK506; and 10 mm NAD. NAD+ Measurements—Cultures were gently washed four times with cold BSS and then extracted with perchloric acid. NAD+ was measured using an enzymatic recycling assay (31Ying W. Sevigny M.B. Chen Y. Swanson R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12227-12232Google Scholar) and normalized to total protein as measured by the bicinchonic acid method. Assessment of Cell Death—Astrocyte death was quantified by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the cell lysates of surviving cells 20–24 h after the MNNG or SIN-1 exposures (10Ying W. Chen Y. Alano C.C. Swanson R.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 774-779Google Scholar). Percentage of cell death in each well was calculated as (1 - (LDH activity)/(control LDH activity)) × 100, with the control LDH activity defined as the mean value obtained in four control wells from the same 24-well plate as the test well. Control wells were treated with medium exchanges only, which causes no or negligible astrocyte death. Detection of MPT—Astrocytes were loaded with calcein-acetoxymethylester (500 nm; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and with MitoTracker-Red (500 nm; Molecular Probes) for 10–30 s The dye loading was done prior to MNNG exposures. MitoTracker probes are cell-permeant, mitochondrion-selective dyes that have a thiol-reactive moiety that retains the dye within the mitochondria after loading (32Poot M. Zhang Y.Z. Kramer J.A. Wells K.S. Jones L.J. Hanzel D.K. Lugade A.G. Singer V.L. Haugland R.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1363-1372Google Scholar). Fluorescence was assessed with an inverted microscope equipped with a CCD digital camera (ORCA-ER; Hamamatsu Corporation, Bridgewater, NJ) at designated time points after incubation with the test compounds. Under the loading conditions employed, there was no baseline calcein signal in the mitochondria, obviating the need for cobalt quenching of the calcein signal (33Petronilli V. Miotto G. Canton M. Brini M. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 725-734Google Scholar). Deconvolution and image overlays were performed using Openlab software (Improvision, Lexington, MA). For quantification, areas of red fluorescence (mitochondria) were identified as regions of interest. The calcein fluorescence in these regions was recorded as mean intensity per unit area and normalized to values obtained in control coverslips prepared in parallel. All values from each experiment, typically 10–15 cells per coverslip, were pooled for each n. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Astrocytes were loaded for at least 30–60 min with 3 μm 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl carbocyanine iodide (JC-1; Molecular Probes) and then imaged after dye loading. Monomer fluorescence was excited at 488 nm, and J-aggregate fluorescence was excited at 560 nm. Fluorescence values were collected as a field average for each excitation/emission pair, with 4–10 fields assessed per coverslip. These values were averaged for each n and normalized to the values obtained from control coverslips prepared in parallel. Studies using tetramethylrhodamine (TMRM; Molecular Probes) to estimate the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) of cells were performed under non-quench conditions as described previously (34Anderson C.M. Norquist B.A. Vesce S. Nicholls D.G. Soine W.H. Duan S. Swanson R.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9203-9209Google Scholar). Stock TMRM was prepared with dimethyl sulfoxide to a concentration of 1 mm, and this was diluted to 1–2 nm in recording buffer (BSS supplemented with PIPES, pH 7.2). The nonquench loading condition was established by loading cultures with a range of TMRM concentrations and confirming a fluorescence decrease after incubation with 10 μm carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), a mitochondrial uncoupler. In addition, FCCP was added at the end of each experimental recording to verify non-quench conditions (i.e. a decrease in TMRM fluorescence). Immunocytochemistry—Immunostaining for poly(ADP-ribose) was performed on cells grown on glass cover slips and fixed in ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (5 min) and subjected to a sequential 70, 90, and 100% EtOH (5 min each). Monoclonal antibody for poly(ADP-ribose) (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) was used at 1:2000 dilution. Immunostaining for AIF and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC, a mitochondrial marker) was performed on cells fixed with ice-cold acetone/methanol (1:1) for 5 min. The antibodies for AIF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and VDAC (Calbiochem) were used at 1:1500 dilutions. Immunostaining was visualized with fluorescencetagged secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) and photographed with a Leica confocal laser microscope. Nuclear counterstaining with propidium iodide was performed after the removal of excess secondary antibody. Statistics—Data are given as mean ± S.E. Results were assessed by analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test (InStat 3.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). p values were designated as * representing p < 0.01 and ** representing p < 0.001. MNNG Induces PARP-1-mediated Cell Death—The primary cortical astrocytes form a confluent layer of cells containing no neurons and <5% microglial cells (29Duan S. Anderson C.M. Keung E.C. Chen Y. Swanson R.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1320-1328Google Scholar,30Chen Y. Vartiainen N.E. Ying W. Chan P.H. Koistinaho J. Swanson R.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1601-1610Google Scholar). Astrocyte proliferation is inhibited by contact inhibition, and, consequently, the astrocyte cultures have a uniform density at confluency. DNA damage and PARP-1 activation were induced in the astrocyte cultures with the alkylating agent MNNG as described previously (9Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13978-13982Google Scholar, 10Ying W. Chen Y. Alano C.C. Swanson R.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 774-779Google Scholar, 31Ying W. Sevigny M.B. Chen Y. Swanson R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12227-12232Google Scholar). A 30-min incubation with 100 μm MNNG reproducibly killed 50–70% of the cells (Fig. 1A) as shown by an LDH assay 24 h after MNNG exposure. Cell death was a delayed process, with negligible death detected at 4 h, 5–15% of the cells dead at 6 h, and near maximal cell death at 16 h after MNNG exposure. MNNG-induced cell death was nearly eliminated in PARP-1-/- cells and in WT cultures treated with the PARP inhibitors benzamide or DPQ (Fig. 1B), confirming that the MNNG-induced cell death was mediated primarily by PARP-1 activation. CsA Prevents PARP-1-mediated Cell Death—We used the potent MPT inhibitor CsA (35Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 5-9Google Scholar) to test whether MPT induction is required for PARP-1-mediated cell death. CsA prevented PARP-1-mediated cell death with an efficacy equivalent to that of the PARP inhibitors and an ED50 of ∼50 nm (Fig. 1B). The possibility that this effect was due to CsA inhibition of calcineurin was excluded by the sub-micromolar concentrations of CsA employed and by the absence of cytoprotection in cultures treated with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (36Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Google Scholar). CsA did not inhibit poly(ADP-ribose) formation (Fig. 1C), thereby excluding the possibility that CsA blocks PARP-1 mediated cell death by inhibiting PARP activity. Measures of cellular NAD+ content further showed that CsA concentrations up to 10 μm had no effect on the NAD+ depletion induced by MNNG exposure (Fig. 1D). These findings suggest that PARP-1 cytotoxicity in astrocytes is mediated through MPT induction. PARP-1 Activation Leads to MPT Induction—More direct evidence for MPT in MNNG-treated astrocytes was obtained by the calcein dye exclusion method (37Petronilli V. Miotto G. Canton M. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. Biofactors. 1998; 8: 263-272Google Scholar). Calcein-acetoxymethylester is modified to its fluorescent form by cytosolic esterases, and, under the loading conditions employed, it is largely excluded from normal mitochondria (Fig. 2A) but enters mitochondria after MPT induction. Astrocytes treated with MNNG exhibited a marked increase in mitochondrial calcein fluorescence, together with a rounding of mitochondrial morphology. There was also an associated shrinkage of cell and nuclear volume in most cells in which mitochondrial calcein fluorescence was prominent (Fig. 2A). None of these changes were in PARP-1-/- astrocytes or in WT astrocytes pre-treated with the PARP inhibitor DPQ, suggesting that they resulted from PARP-1 activation. Importantly, these changes were also blocked by 200 nm CsA (but not 1 μm FK506), supporting MPT as the route of calcein entry (Fig. 2, A and B). MPT induction was a delayed process, rarely detected at 1 h after MNNG removal and inconsistently observed at 2 h after MNNG removal (data not shown), but fully manifest by 4 h after the MNNG incubations. At this time point, calcein fluorescence was evident in nearly every mitochondrion in the MNNG-treated WT astrocytes. PARP-1 Activation Causes Mitochondrial Membrane Depolarization—TMRM was used to monitor ΔΨm under non-quenching conditions, such that reductions in mitochondrial fluorescence were indicative of ΔΨm depolarization (34Anderson C.M. Norquist B.A. Vesce S. Nicholls D.G. Soine W.H. Duan S. Swanson R.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9203-9209Google Scholar, 38Nicholls D.G. Ward M.W. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 166-174Google Scholar). Activation of PARP-1 with MNNG led to a decrease in whole-cell TMRM fluorescence (Fig. 3A). ΔΨm depolarization began during the 30-min MNNG incubation and continued for several hours after MNNG removal. Depolarization was markedly attenuated in cells treated with the PARP inhibitor DPQ. CsA did not significantly alter the decrease in TMRM fluorescence during MNNG exposure, but cells pre-treated with CsA were able to recover ΔΨm to near basal levels after MNNG exposure. FK506 had no effect on the MNNG-induced ΔΨm depolarization. A separate series of experiments were performed using the fluorescent probe JC-1 to assess ΔΨm. As shown in Fig. 3B, the results obtained by the JC-1 method were in accord with those obtained with TMRM. Fig. 3C shows representative JC-1 images captured at 4 h after MNNG removal. Mitochondria in cells treated with MNNG showed an increase in monomer fluorescence and a decrease in J-aggregate fluorescence, indicating ΔΨm depolarization. As quantified in Fig. 3B, ΔΨm depolarization was not observed in PARP-1-/- cells, cells treated with the PARP inhibitor DPQ, or in cells treated with CsA. To exclude the possibility that changes in TMRM or JC-1 fluorescence were an indirect effect of plasma membrane depolarization, a separate set of cultures were exposed to medium containing 50 mm K+ either with or without 2.5 mm Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+, the 50 mm K+ medium caused no change in JC-1 fluorescence and only negligible change in TMRM fluorescence (not shown), confirming that plasma membrane potential had a minimal effect on the fluorescence signals (39Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Google Scholar). NAD+ Repletion Prevents MPT and Prevents PARP-1-mediated Astrocyte Death—Extensive activation of PARP-1 consumes NAD+ and depletes adenine nucleotide pools (2Virag L. Szabo C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 375-429Google Scholar, 8Berger N.A. Radiat. Res. 1985; 101: 4-15Google Scholar, 10Ying W. Chen Y. Alano C.C. Swanson R.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 774-779Google Scholar). Adenine nucleotide depletion is one of several factors that can promote MPT (15Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Google Scholar, 40Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Google Scholar). To determine whether NAD+ depletion mediates PARP-1-induced MPT, we restored NAD+ concentrations to near-normal levels in MNNG-treated astrocytes by adding exogenous NAD+ to the culture medium (24Verderio C. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Fedele E. Schenk U. De Flora A. Matteoli M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 646-657Google Scholar, 25Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Google Scholar, 26Ying W. Garnier P. Swanson R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 809-813Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). The NAD+ depletion that normally results from PARP-1 activation was negated by the addition of 10 mm NAD+ to the medium immediately after MNNG washout. Astrocytes treated in this manner did not exhibit MPT (Fig. 2), and NAD+ repletion reduced MNNG-induced astrocyte death to an extent comparable with that achieved with PARP inhibitors or CsA (Fig. 4A). The possibility of direct or indirect inhibition of PARP-1 by NAD+ repletion was excluded, because NAD+ did not block poly(ADP-ribose) formation (Fig. 1C) and also because NAD+ was added after the MNNG had been removed, a time point at which PARP inhibitors have been shown to have negligible effects on astrocyte survival (10Ying W. Chen Y. Alano C.C. Swanson R.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 774-779Google Scholar). DNA damage with MNNG provides a reproducible model of PARP-1-mediated cell death, but, under conditions of ischemia and inflammation, it is peroxynitrite and other reactive oxygen species that are primarily responsible for DNA damage and PARP-1 activation (4Szabo C. Dawson V.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 287-298Google Scholar, 41Szabo C. Shock. 1996; 6: 79-88Google Scholar). To confirm the physiological relevance of the MNNG model, astrocyte cultures were treated with SIN-1, which forms superoxide, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite in oxygenated solutions. As shown in Fig. 4B, the results obtained using SIN-1 were similar to those obtained using MNNG (Figs. 4A and 1, A and B), with both CsA and NAD+ reducing astrocyte death to a degree comparable with the PARP inhibitors. Similarly, SIN-1 at this concentration (10 mm) was not cytotoxic to astrocytes cultured from PARP-1-/- mice (Fig. 4B). The effect of NAD+ repletion on astrocyte ΔΨm was followed with TMRM, as shown in Fig. 5. Activation of PARP-1 with MNNG caused a rapid initial depolarization of ΔΨm, followed by a slower continued depolarization after MNNG removal (Figs. 3A and 5A). The addition of NAD+ after MNNG removal stopped the decline in TMRM fluorescence and led to a slow normalization of ΔΨm, as would be expected in cells that will survive. The ΔΨm changes in individual mitochondria were not uniform within or between cells. To characterize this heterogeneous response, the fluorescence values of individual mitochondria at 4 h after MNNG washout were quantified, binned according to normalized TMRM fluorescence, and plotted as a histogram (Fig. 5B). A minor degree of ΔΨm heterogeneity was observed under basal conditions, but a majority (> 90%) of the mitochondria had a TMRM fluorescence ratio within 10% of the population mean. At 4 h after MNNG incubation there was a left-shift of the histogram toward lower TMRM fluorescence, as well as a dispersion of the individual mitochondrial TMRM fluorescence values. Mitochondria in cultures treated with NAD+ following the MNNG exposures were, on average, rightshifted compared with MNNG alone, indicating a recovery of ΔΨm. These studies of individual mitochondria were facilitated by the relative lack of intracellular mitochondrial movement during the course of these studies. In contrast to neurons (42Rintoul G.L. Filiano A.J. Brocard J.B. Kress G.J. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7881-7888Google Scholar), <5% of the mitochondria moved out of the regions of interest identified in the initial fluorescence image, a difference possibly due, in part, to the very flat shape of astrocytes. The number of moving mitochondrial was not obviously altered by experimental conditions. CsA and NAD+ Repletion Prevent PARP-1-induced AIF Translocation—Because AIF translocation has also been identified as a mediator of PARP-1-induced cell death, (11Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Google Scholar), we also examined the relationships between PARP-1 activation, MPT, and AIF translocation. Double labeling of AIF and the mitochondria-specific VDAC 4 h after MNNG exposure confirmed that AIF translocated to the nucleus after PARP-1 activation and that this translocation was blocked by PARP-1 inhibition (Fig. 6, A and B). AIF translocation was also prevented in cells in which MPT was blocked by CsA or NAD+, suggesting that AIF translocation requires MPT. A time course of the AIF translocation is shown in Fig. 6C. These time points can be compared with time points at which NAD+ repletion can preserve astrocyte viability (Fig. 7). The two curves are nearly inverse images of one another, suggesting that NAD+ is ineffective in preserving cell viability once MPT has occurred.Fig. 7The effect of NAD+ on cell survival diminished with increasing time after MNNG exposure. 10 mm NAD+ significantly reduced cell death up to 3 h after MNNG exposure. Data points are means of three independent experiments (n = 3), each with measurements from 3 culture wells. **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These results suggest that both NAD+ depletion and MPT are necessary events in the sequence leading from PARP-1 activation to cell death. The findings support a complex interaction between the nuclear and mitochondrial cell death programs during PARP-1 ac"

To date, two RNase H enzymes (H1 and H2) have been cloned and shown to be expressed in human cells and tissues. To determine the role of RNase H1 in the mechanism of action of DNA-like antisense drugs, we varied the levels of the enzyme in human cells and mouse liver and determined the correlation of those levels with the effects of a number of DNA-like antisense drugs. Our results demonstrate that in human cells RNase H1 is responsible for most of the activity of DNA-like antisense drugs. Further, we show that there are several additional previously undescribed RNases H in human cells that may participate in the effects of DNA-like antisense oligonucleotides."

Previous studies have demonstrated the effects of mechanical forces on changes in biosynthesis and mRNA levels of particular extracellular matrix molecules, and have identified certain signaling pathways that may be involved. However, the broad extent and kinetics of mechano-regulation of gene transcription has not been studied in depth. We applied static compressive strains to bovine cartilage explants for periods between 1 and 24 h and measured the response of 28 genes using real time PCR. Compression time courses were also performed in the presence of an intracellular calcium chelator or an inhibitor of cyclic AMP-activated protein kinase A. Cluster analysis of the data revealed four main expression patterns: two groups containing either transiently up-regulated or duration-enhanced expression profiles could each be subdivided into genes that did or did not require intracellular calcium release and cyclic AMP-activated protein kinase A for their mechano-regulation. Transcription levels for aggrecan, type II collagen, and link protein were up-regulated ∼2–3-fold during the first 8 h of 50% compression and subsequently down-regulated to levels below that of free-swelling controls by 24 h. Transcription levels of matrix metalloproteinases-3, -9, and -13, aggrecanase-1, and the matrix protease regulator cyclooxygenase-2 increased with the duration of 50% compression 2–16-fold by 24 h. Thus, transcription of proteins involved in matrix remodeling and catabolism dominated over anabolic matrix proteins as the duration of static compression increased. Immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun were dramatically up-regulated 6–30-fold, respectively, during the first 8 h of 50% compression and remained up-regulated after 24 h.

The major load-bearing constituents of the ECM are type II collagen and aggregates of the proteoglycan, aggrecan, which provide the tensile and compressive stiffness of the tissue, respectively. Also present in the ECM are families of matrix proteinases, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs), growth factors, and cytokines that together regulate ECM remodeling and turnover in health and disease (1Hascall V.C. Kuettner K.E. The Many Faces of Osteoarthritis. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel2002Crossref Google Scholar). It is known that mechanical exercise of the knee joint in vivo increases the density of aggrecan in cartilage (2Saamamen A.M. Kiviranta I. Jurvelin J. Helminen H.J. Tammi M. Connect. Tissue Res. 1994; 30: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas knee joint inactivity results in decreased aggrecan deposition (3Behrens F. Kraft E.L. Oegema Jr., T.R. J. Orthop.

Traumatic injury to cartilage diminishes mechanical strength and leads to excessive catabolism of the ECM, increasing the risk of osteoarthritis later in life (5Lohmander L.S. Hoerrner L.A.

Rheumatol. 1993; 20: 1362-1368PubMed Google Scholar).A number of model systems have been developed to simulate various aspects of the mechanical loading forces experienced by articular cartilage in vivo. Compressive and shear forces have been applied to cartilage explants and chondrocyte cultures in vitro to examine the transduction of mechanical signals into biological responses. Application of 50% static compression to cartilage explants decreased synthesis of type II collagen and proteoglycans (PG) within the first 1–2 h of loading, and synthesis remained suppressed throughout a 24-h loading period (6Guilak F.

Intermittent hydrostatic pressure applied to human chondrocytes in monolayer culture at a frequency of 1 Hz (4 h/day for 4 days) increased aggrecan and type II collagen gene and protein expression (>1.4-fold) (21Ikenoue T.

They observed an increase in aggrecan mRNA and a decrease in MMP-3 mRNA within 1 h following stimulation, with a return to base-line levels by 24 h. In a single experiment applying intermittent hydrostatic pressure to human chondrosarcoma cells, changes in the expression of 51 genes were measured by cDNA array technology without widespread change in RNA stability (23Sironen R.K. Karjalainen H.M. Torronen K. Elo M.A. Kaarniranta K. Takigawa M. Helminen H.J. Lammi M.J. Biorheology. 2002; 39: 111-117PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that many genes may be influenced by mechanical stimuli.Studies have also focused on cellular mechanotransduction events that may initiate changes in gene expression. Application of intermittent PIS to chondrocytes induced α5β1 integrin activation of interleukin-4, which caused cell hyperpolarization via intracellular calcium release (24Millward-Sadler S.J.

Inhibition of interleukin-4 suppressed the up-regulation of aggrecan gene expression observed due to PIS (22Millward-Sadler S.J. Wright M.O. Davies L.W. Nuki G. Salter D.M. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2091-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Intracellular calcium release, cAMP, and the phospholipase C pathway have been implicated for aggrecan gene up-regulation in response to static compression in cartilage explants (25Valhmu W.B. Raia F.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Static compression also increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation within minutes of application, with sustained increases during 24 h of compression (26Fanning P.J. Emkey G. Smith R.J. Grodzinsky A.J. Szasz N. Trippel S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50940-50948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although such signaling pathways have been identified in the mechanical regulation of aggrecan gene expression, less is known about chondrocyte gene expression patterns of other ECM-related molecules or whether common upstream signaling pathways are responsible for their regulation.Given these observations regarding the sensitivity of chondrocyte biosynthesis to mechanical forces in vivo and in the cartilage explant model, we hypothesized that mechanical loading would also induce widespread transcriptional changes, particularly for molecules involved in ECM maintenance. Our objective was to characterize the transcriptional response of chondrocytes from intact cartilage to static compression, focusing on a range of anabolic, catabolic, and signaling genes involved in tissue homeostasis. Temporal expression profiles of 28 genes were measured to compare immediate and long term changes in response to sustained compression. Molecular inhibitors of intracellular calcium, cAMP and AP-1, were used to identify possible upstream signaling pathways involved in the mechanotransduction of the genes studied here.

These computational techniques can help to classify groups of genes with common upstream signaling pathways and may help to predict certain cell behavior (28Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O.

We found that both anabolic and catabolic genes were induced by static compression, but with contrasting expression patterns. Intracellular calcium and cAMP were found to play fundamental roles in the mechanical regulation of gene transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCartilage Extraction and Mechanical Loading—Articular cartilage disks (3 mm diameter, 1 mm thick) were obtained from the middle zone of the patello-femoral groove of 1–4-week-old calves as described previously (8Sah R.L.Y. Kim Y.J. Doong J.Y.H. Grodzinsky A.J. Plaas A.H.K. Sandy J.D. J. Orthop. Res. 1989; 7: 619-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Disks were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and maintained in low glucose Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes buffer, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 20 μg/ml ascorbate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Disks were allowed to equilibrate for 2–5 days before loading, with media changes every 2nd day and 12 h before loading. Anatomically matched disks (6 disks per time point per loading treatment) were transferred into polysulfone loading chambers (8Sah R.L.Y. Kim Y.J. Doong J.Y.H. Grodzinsky A.J. Plaas A.H.K. Sandy J.D. J. Orthop. Res. 1989; 7: 619-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), slowly compressed over an ∼3-min period to 25 or 50% of cut thickness, and maintained at these static strain levels for 1, 2, 4, 8, or 24 h (25% strain, n = 4; 50% strain, n = 11), with disks kept in free-swelling conditions as controls (see Fig. 1, A and B). Upon completion of loading, disks were stored at –80 °C in RNA-later solution (Qiagen).Inhibitor Studies—To investigate the role of intracellular signaling pathways during static compression, molecular inhibitors were added to media prior to application of 50% compression (Fig. 1, C and D). Cartilage disks were pre-incubated for 1 h with 10 μm BAPTA-AM, a chelator of intracellular calcium (AG Scientific, Inc.), or 50 μm (Rp)-cAMP, an inhibitor of cAMP-activated protein kinase A (Sigma), which have been previously shown to completely inhibit mechanically induced aggrecan gene regulation (20Valhmu W.B.

J. 2002; 361: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For each time point six untreated and six treated disks were placed into a 12-well polysulfone chamber to allow identical compression (n = 4–5). In separate experiments, paclitaxel, an inhibitor of transcription factor AP-1 binding to DNA (10 μm, Sigma), was added 24 h prior to 2 h of 50% static compression (n = 5), at concentrations shown previously to inhibit AP-1 activity in bovine chondrocytes (31Hui A. Min W.X. Tang J. Cruz T.F. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To assess RNA stability, disks were either maintained in free-swelling conditions or loaded for 2 h at 50% strain and then released to free-swell for up to 6 h before being stored at –80 °C (n = 2). Actinomycin D was added to media immediately upon completion of loading (Fig. 1E) at concentrations shown previously to inhibit transcription in bovine chondrocytes and cartilage explants (30 μm, Sigma) (23Sironen R.K. Karjalainen H.M. Torronen K. Elo M.A. Kaarniranta K. Takigawa M. Helminen H.J. Lammi M.J. Biorheology. 2002; 39: 111-117PubMed Google Scholar).RNA Extraction, Primer Calibration, and Real Time PCR—For each time point and loading treatment, six cartilage disks were pulverized using liquid nitrogen-cooled mortar and pestles and homogenized in QIAshredder tubes (Qiagen) spun at 10,000 rpm for 2 min. RNA was then extracted from the clear supernatant by using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit protocol with the DNase digest (Qiagen). RNA was stored in 40 μl of RNase-free water at –80 °C until reverse transcription was performed using Applied Biosystems Reagents. Real time PCR was performed on a 384-well/plate ABI7900HT machine (2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C and 50 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C and 1 min at 60 °C) by using SybrGreen MasterMix (Applied Biosystems). The SybrGreen Master mix and H2O were combined, and aliquots were dispersed into cDNA-containing tubes. A multipipette was used to distribute 9-μl aliquots into a 384-well plate, followed by 1 μl of 10 μm forward and reverse primer mix. Free-swelling controls and inhibitor-treated samples were always run on the same plate as untreated compressed samples. A total of 28 primer pairs for the 28 genes listed in Table I were designed with amplification product length of 85–130 bp and annealing temperature of ∼60 °C. All primers were tested to produce proportional changes in threshold cycle with varying starting cDNA quantity. Measured threshold cycles (CT) were converted to relative copy numbers using primer-specific standard curves.Table IGenes examined using real time PCR, categorized by functionMatrix proteinsMatrix proteasesProtease inhibitorsTranscription factorsCytokines/growth factorsIntracellular signalingReference genesHousekeepingAggrecanMMP1TIMP1Sox9IL-1βCOX-2HSP7018SType I collagenMMP3TIMP2c-FosTNFαMAPk1Ribosomal-6PG3PDHType II collagenMMP9TIMP3c-JunTGFβNOS2Type X collagenMMP13IGF1FibromodulinADAMTS4FibronectinADAMTS5Link protein Open table in a new tab Data Normalization and Statistical Analyses—For each experiment and every loading condition, gene expression levels were normalized by the average levels of mean-centered housekeeping genes 18 S and G3PDH. The time course of each gene was then normalized by the corresponding free-swelling expression level. For example, the BAPTA-AM-treated time courses were normalized by BAPTA-AM-treated free-swelling controls after normalizing by housekeeping genes. Expression levels further than three standard deviations from the mean were considered outliers and removed. Gene expression levels induced by compression were compared with free-swelling expression levels using two-tailed Student's t tests. Comparison between compression time courses with and without the presence of inhibitors was performed using comparison of means two-tailed t tests, with Welch corrected degrees of freedom for unequal variance. Games-Howell corrected standard deviations were used to account for unequal sample sizes, as F tests had revealed significant differences between untreated and treated gene expression level variances (data not shown). Skew and Kurtosis criteria were used to confirm that the data were normally distributed. A p value of less than or equal to 0.05 was used to assess statistical significance.Clustering Analysis—To analyze further the expression patterns and pathways activated by compression, the expression levels for each gene from the 50% compression, BAPTA-AM-treated, and (Rp)-cAMP-treated time courses were combined into 15-point expression vectors (23 genes had complete time courses). These expression vectors were then standardized to have equal variance, to emphasize expression patterns rather than amplitudes, and were then iteratively clustered using two different k means clustering techniques (see Appendix in the Supplemental Material). First, principal component analysis (29Alter O. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10101-10106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 30Holter N.S. Mitra M.

Each standardized expression vector was then projected onto the three main principal components, and the resulting three-dimensional coordinates were k means clustered using a Euclidean distance metric. The second approach was to cluster the standardized expression vectors directly using correlation as a metric (27Dougherty E.R. Barrera J. Brun M. Kim S. Cesar R.M. Chen Y.D. Bittner M. Trent J.M. J.

Projection coordinates for each group centroid were calculated by averaging the projection coordinates of each gene within a group. Centroid vectors were formed by adding the three main principal components weighted by the centroid projection coordinates. Centroid variances were calculated, and the Euclidean distance between the projection coordinates of centroids was used to perform comparison of means Student's t tests to assess the distinctiveness of expression trends (for details see Appendix in the Supplemental Material).RESULTSEffect of Static Compression on Gene Expression—Static compression was applied for 1–8 h at 25% strain and 1–24 h at 50% strain, and expression levels of 28 ECM maintenance genes were monitored. For ease of presentation and discussion, selected results for specific genes are reported in Figs. 2, 3, 4; the complete results for all 28 genes in this study are given in the Appendix Figs. A1 and A2, in the Supplemental Material. Consistent with previous findings, aggrecan (19Ragan P.M. Badger A.M. Cook M. Chin V.I. Gowen M. Grodzinsky A.J. Lark M.W. J. Orthop.

In contrast, type I collagen was down-regulated in response to 25% compression and increasingly up-regulated during 50% compression, greater than 3-fold after 24 h (Fig. 2); however, comparison of CT values showed that absolute mRNA abundance of type I collagen was 2 orders of magnitude lower than type II collagen (data not shown). MMP-3 and ADAMTS4 were increasingly up-regulated with 50% compression duration up to 16- and 4-fold, respectively (Fig. 2), and TNFα, IL-1β, and COX-2 were similarly affected (Fig. A2, Supplemental Material). MMP-9 and -13 were up-regulated 2- and 8.6-fold by 24 h of 50% compression, whereas MMP-1 and ADAMTS5 were down-regulated by 30% (Fig. A1, Supplemental Material). Transcription factor Sox9 was up-regulated more by 25% compression (up to 1.7-fold) than 50% compression; in both cases the effect was transient lasting 4 h or less (Fig. A2, Supplemental Material). c-Fos and c-Jun showed marked up-regulation during the 25% compression time course as well as peaked up-regulation (6- and 35-fold, respectively) during the 50% compression time course (Fig. 2). The TIMPs were generally down-regulated by 50% compression with up-regulation only occurring at initial time points (Fig. A2, Supplemental Material). Fibromodulin, fibronectin, and ribosomal 6-phosphate were in general unaffected by static compression (Figs. A1 and A2, Supplemental Material). HSP70 was slightly up-regulated throughout the 50% compression time course (Fig. A2, Supplemental Material). Insulin-like growth factor-1 and nitric-oxide synthase-2 were highly up-regulated at certain time points, but their expression levels were scarcely detectable even with real time PCR (Fig. A2, Supplemental Material).Fig. 2Selected gene expression levels induced by static compression, measured by real time PCR. 25% = 1–8 h of 25% static compression (n = 4). 50% = 1–24 h of 50% static compression (1–8 h, n = 11 and 24 h, n = 4).

Earlier work indicated that ASIC1 contributed to the current in these neurons and suggested its importance for normal behavior. However, the specific contribution of ASIC1 and ASIC2 subunits to acid-evoked currents in hippocampal neurons remained uncertain. To decipher the individual role of the ASIC subunits, we studied H+-gated currents in neurons from both ASIC1 and ASIC2 null mice. We found that much of the current was produced by ASIC1a/2a heteromultimeric channels, and individual subunits made distinct contributions. The ASIC1a subunit was key in establishing current amplitude. The ASIC2a subunit had little effect on amplitude but influenced desensitization, recovery from desensitization, pH sensitivity, and the response to modulatory agents. We also found heterogeneity in the contribution of ASIC2 throughout the neuronal population, with individual neurons expressing both ASIC1a homomultimeric and ASIC1a/2a heteromultimeric channels. Studies of neurons heterozygous for disrupted ASIC alleles indicated that the properties of H+-gated currents are dependent on the proportion of the individual subunits. These findings indicate that the absolute and relative amounts of ASIC subunits determine the amplitude and properties of hippocampal H+-gated currents and therefore may contribute to normal physiology and pathophysiology.

Although the extracellular pH of the central nervous system is tightly controlled, both localized and global reductions in pH have important physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences (1Chesler M. Kaila K. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 396-402Google Scholar). For example, repetitive nerve activity transiently reduces the local pH, perhaps by releasing the acidic contents of synaptic vesicles (2Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E.

In the peripheral nervous system, studies of ASIC null animals revealed a contribution of ASIC1, -2, and -3 to acid-evoked currents and showed their contribution to mechanosensation and acid-evoked nociception (24Benson C.J.

Studies in mice bearing disruptions of the ASIC1 gene have demonstrated the importance of ASIC1 for normal central nervous system function; ASIC1 –/– mice exhibited defective spatial learning, eye-blink conditioning, fear conditioning, and hippocampal synaptic plasticity (40Wemmie J.A.

In an earlier study, we found that the loss of ASIC1 abolished pH 5-evoked currents in hippocampal neurons (41Wemmie J.A. Chen J. Askwith C.C. Hruska-Hageman A.M. Price M.P. Nolan B.C. Yoder P.G. Lamani E. Hoshi T. Freeman J.H.J. Welsh M.J. Neuron. 2002; 34: 463-477Google Scholar). This result seemed surprising, because ASIC1a is not the only ASIC subunit expressed in the central nervous system; hippocampal neurons also express ASIC2a and -2b (12Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R.

Although recombinant ASIC2b generates no current, heterologous expression of ASIC2a does elicit acid-evoked cation currents (12Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H.

In addition, Zn2+, which modulates ASIC2a-containing channels but not those produced by ASIC1a, potentiated hippocampal acid-evoked current (8Baron A. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 485-494Google Scholar, 30Baron A. Schaefer L. Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35361-35367Google Scholar). Therefore, the goal of this work was to learn which ASIC subunits contribute to central H+-gated currents and to determine whether they function as homomultimers or heteromultimers. To accomplish this, we examined the characteristics of whole-cell H+-gated currents in hippocampal neurons from mice with disrupted ASIC1 and ASIC2 genes. We focused on channel properties that differentiate the individual ASIC subunits including pH sensitivity, desensitization, recovery from desensitization, and sensitivity to FMRFamide and zinc. In light of earlier reports, we were particularly interested in testing the hypothesis that ASIC2 contributes to these currents in hippocampal neurons.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Culture—Mouse hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared from postnatal day 1–2 mice as described previously (44Mennerick S.

Hippocampi from 4–10 pups were pooled and plated in 24-well dishes on 35-mm collagencoated cover slips. Cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside was added at day 3–4 to inhibit glial growth.

We observed no differences between the groups of wild-type neurons, and they were combined for comparison to heterozygous neurons (ASIC1 +/– and ASIC2 +/–).Mouse ASIC1a, -2a, and -2b were cloned into pMT3 for heterologous expression as described (24Benson C.J.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with 1–3 μg of DNA using the Transfast lipid reagent (Promega, Madison, WI).

However, mouse ASICs studied in CHO cells produced properties very similar to those we reported previously in COS cells (26Hesselager M. Timmermann D.B. Ahring P.K. J. Biol.

The pC1EGFP vector encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was added at 20% the DNA concentration to identify transfected cells using epifluorescence microscopy. For experiments assessing the function of ASIC2b with ASIC2a, pMT3 was added to maintain a constant final DNA concentration. Cells were studied 2–3 days following transfection.Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Electrodes were filled with the intracellular solution containing (in mm): 120 KCl, 10 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 2 ATP. The pH was adjusted to 7.3 with tetramethylammonium hydroxide. Extracellular solutions contained (in mm): 128 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 5.55 glucose, 10 HEPES, 10 2-(4-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid, 2 CaCl2, and 1 MgCl2. The pH was adjusted with tetramethylammonium hydroxide, and osmolarity was adjusted with tetramethylammonium chloride. For neuronal cultures, inhibitors of synaptic activity were routinely added to the extracellular solution. These included 1 μm tetrodotoxin, 10 μm 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione, 50 μmdl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (dAP5), and 30 μm (–)-bicuculline methiodide. Tetrodotoxin has been shown to alter the kinetics of H+-gated channels in some neurons (46Akaike N. Krishtal O.A. Maruyama T. J. Neurophysiol. 1990; 63: 805-813Google Scholar, 47Akaike N. Ueno S. Prog. Neurobiol. 1994; 43: 73-83Google Scholar). However, the concentration of tetrodotoxin used in our experiments had no effect on H+-gated currents in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. The peptide FRRFamide was synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma.Electrodes had a resistance of 3–5 megohms, and series resistance was compensated by 70% after establishing the whole-cell configuration. Neurons were held at –70 mV, and solutions were changed by gravity-fed perfusion pipes. Data were acquired using an AXOPATCH 200B amplifier with pCLAMPex 8.1 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments) and IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Amplitude was determined by subtracting the baseline current at pH 7.4 from the peak current amplitude determined in Clampfit (Axon Instruments). Capacitance was measured for each neuron in Clampex (Axon Instruments). The tau of desensitization (τd) was calculated by fitting the data to a single exponential using IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics). Because of the complex nature of current desensitization with FRRFamide application, the Td ½ of desensitization was used as a quantitative measurement of desensitization. The Td ½ of desensitization was recorded as the time from the peak current amplitude to half-maximal peak current (as described above).Because of current run-down, data for pH dose-response, zinc potentiation, and recovery from desensitization were normalized to the average of the preceding and following control pH applications. All data were obtained from at least two different culture preparations representing 8–20 mice. Because current amplitude can vary depending on the time in culture, neurons of different genotypes were prepared within 24 h of one another, cultured identically, and analyzed on the same day after culture. Statistical significance was evaluated using the paired or unpaired Student's t test as appropriate.Northern Analysis and RT-PCR—Hippocampi of 14-day-old mice were dissected and placed into RNAlater solution (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The hippocampi from four animals were pooled, and RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini purification kit (Qiagen) and quantified. Total RNA (10 μg per lane) was run on a formaldehyde-agarose gel using the NorthernMax system (Ambion, Austin, TX) and transferred to BrightStar-Plus membrane (Ambion, Austin, TX). The probes used for these studies were generated from PCR products and included the following: an 528-bp product specific to ASIC2a (primers m2AF, 5′-atggacctcaaggagagcccc-3′; and m2AR, 5′-ggtgaagtcttgatgcccaca-3′), an 495-bp product specific to ASIC2b (primers m2BF, 5′-tgtggcccgcacaacttctcc-3′; and m2BR, 3′-ctggccttctgcacgtccctt-3′), and an ∼900-bp product common to both transcripts (m2ABF, 3′-gatggcaagcctctgctcacc-3′; and m2ABR, 5′-aatctcctccagggtgcccaa-3′). The radioactive probes were generated using the Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Applied Science) and purified using NucAway™ Spin Columns (Ambion). Blots were visualized by phosphorscreen (STORM; Amersham Biosciences).For RT-PCR analysis, first strand cDNA was synthesized with Superscript II (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers. Primers used for PCR amplification of sequences specific to ASIC2a or ASIC2b, and common to ASIC2a/2b, were designed to cross intron/exon boundaries. The following primers were used: ASIC2a, 5′-aacctcaatggcttccggttctcc-3′ and 5′-cccccccttgaccgtggtgagcag-3′ (360-bp band); ASIC2b, 5′-cgagtgcaccgcgagtggagccgc-3′ and 5′-cccccccttgaccgtggtgagcag-3′ (430-bp band); and ASIC2a/2b, 5′-tccgagaacattcttgttctggat-3′ and 5′-gttctcatcatggctcccttcctc-3′ (210-bp band). The cycling parameters using the RoboCycler thermocycler (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) consisted of 40 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min.RESULTSExtracellular pH 4 Solutions Activate H+-gated Currents in Some ASIC1 –/– Hippocampal Neurons—Central neurons express ASIC1a, -2a, and -2b subunits (4Waldmann R.

To determine the contribution of individual ASICs to hippocampal H+-gated currents, we first studied neurons from ASIC1 –/– animals. Consistent with our earlier work (41Wemmie J.A. Chen J. Askwith C.C. Hruska-Hageman A.M. Price M.P. Nolan B.C. Yoder P.G. Lamani E. Hoshi T. Freeman J.H.J. Welsh M.J. Neuron. 2002; 34: 463-477Google Scholar), pH 5 solutions failed to activate current (Fig. 1A). However, previous findings suggested that recombinant ASIC2a homomultimeric channels require a very low pH for activation, and ASIC2a/2b heteromultimeric channels require an even greater reduction in pH (12Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Google Scholar, 43Ueda T. Ugawa S. Yamamura H. Imaizumi Y. Shimada S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7376-7380Google Scholar). Therefore, we applied a more acidic solution (pH 4) and uncovered amiloride-sensitive currents in ASIC1 –/– neurons (Fig. 1A shows some examples). The average peak current was dramatically reduced compared with wild-type neurons (Fig. 1, A and B), and not every cell responded. Approximately 43% of the ASIC1 –/– neurons showed a transient amiloride-sensitive current during pH 4 application. In contrast, acidic solutions (pH 4 or 5) elicited transient currents in >95% of wild-type neurons (41Wemmie J.A. Chen J. Askwith C.C. Hruska-Hageman A.M. Price M.P. Nolan B.C. Yoder P.G. Lamani E. Hoshi T. Freeman J.H.J. Welsh M.J. Neuron. 2002; 34: 463-477Google Scholar).The presence of ASIC2a in the hippocampus made it a candidate to generate the H+-gated currents in ASIC1 –/– cells. One feature that distinguishes heterologously expressed ASIC2a and ASIC2a/2b channels from channels containing ASIC1 subunits is their slower desensitization (4Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Google Scholar, 11Champigny G. Voilley N. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7376-7380Google Scholar). We found that transient currents from ASIC1 –/– neurons desensitized more slowly than those in wild-type neurons (Fig. 1, A and C). Thus, the expression of ASIC2a and -2b in the hippocampus, the failure of ASIC2b expression to generate current, the requirement for very low pH solutions to activate, and the slow desensitization (τd) suggest that ASIC2a (either alone or as a heteromultimeric channel with ASIC2b) generated currents in ASIC1 –/– neurons.Loss of ASIC2 Enhances pH Sensitivity and Slows Desensitization of Acid-evoked Currents in Hippocampal Neurons—To further test the hypothesis that ASIC2 subunits contribute to H+-gated currents, we compared wild-type and ASIC2 –/– neurons; disruption of the ASIC2 gene eliminates both ASIC2a and ASIC2b subunits (34Price M.P. Lewin G.B. McIlwrath S.L. Cheng C. Xie J. Heppenstall P.A. Stucky C.L. Mannsfeldt A.G. Brennan T.J. Drummond H.A. Qiao J. Benson C.J. Tarr D.E. Hrstka R.F. Yang B. Williamson R.A. Welsh M.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 1007-1011Google Scholar). A pH 5 application generated currents with comparable peak amplitudes in wild-type and ASIC2 –/– neurons (Fig. 2, A and B). This result suggests that ASIC2 made little contribution to current amplitude. Therefore, we studied additional properties. Earlier work showed that currents from heterologously expressed ASIC2a channels required more acidic solutions for activation than ASIC1a channels, and ASIC2a/1a heteromultimers had intermediate pH sensitivity (24Benson C.J. Xie J. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Henss J.M. Welsh M.J. Snyder P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2338-2343Google Scholar, 28Bassilana F. Champigny G. Waldmann R. de Weille J.R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28819-28822Google Scholar). In wild-type hippocampal neurons, reducing extracellular pH increased current amplitude (Fig. 2C), consistent with earlier work (8Baron A. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 485-494Google Scholar). Eliminating ASIC2 increased the pH sensitivity; for example, pH 6.3 solutions stimulated 59% of the pH 5-induced current in ASIC2 –/– neurons versus only 26% in wild-type neurons.Fig. 2Proton-gated currents from ASIC2 +/+ and –/– hippocampal neurons.

ER stress results from the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER; cells can alleviate this stress by degrading or refolding these proteins. The IRE1-XBP1 pathway directs both protein refolding and degradation in response to ER stress. Like IRE1-XBP1, other branches of the ER stress response mediate protein refolding. However, IRE1-XBP1 can also specifically activate protein degradation. We show here that XBP1 expression is elevated in cells carrying HCV subgenomic replicons, but XBP1 trans-activating activity is repressed. This prevents the IRE1-XBP1 transcriptional induction of EDEM (ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein). The mRNA expression of EDEM is required for the degradation of misfolded proteins. Consequently, misfolded proteins are stable in cells expressing HCV replicons. HCV may suppress the IRE1-XBP1 pathway to stimulate the synthesis of its viral proteins. IRE1α-null MEFs, a cell line with a defective IRE1-XBP1 pathway, show elevated levels of HCV IRES-mediated translation. Therefore, HCV may suppress the IRE1-XBP1 pathway to not only promote HCV expression but also to contribute to the persistence of the virus in infected hepatocytes.

Viral Hepat. 1999; 6: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). HCV is a positive strand RNA virus of ∼9600 nucleotides in length encoding a polyprotein precursor of ∼3000 amino acids (2Bartenschlager R. Lohmann V. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1631-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 3Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 55-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The HCV polyprotein precursor is co- and post-translationally cleaved to produce at least 10 polypeptides including the structural proteins (core, E1, and E2) and nonstructural proteins (NS2 to NS5B). HCV nonstructural proteins direct viral replication from a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) replication complex that is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (4Hijikata M.H. Mizushima H. Tanji Y.

Virol. 2001; 76: 7453-7459Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar).ER stress interrupts protein folding causing the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER. These misfolded proteins must be refolded or degraded to alleviate the stress placed on the ER. Cells accomplish this by activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) (see Ref. 8Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar for a recent review). The UPR is linked to at least three different mechanisms used by cells to deal with unfolded proteins: transcriptional induction, protein degradation, and translational attenuation.Transcriptional induction of ER chaperones and other selective genes of the protein folding machinery improve the ability of the ER to cope with unfolded proteins. ATF6 initiates the UPR by activating the transcription of ER chaperones. ATF6(P) is an ER membrane-bound transcription factor that is activated post-translationally by the presence of unfolded proteins in the ER (9Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). ER stress causes the proteolytic cleavage of the transcriptionally active N-terminal domain of ATF6, ATF6(N), from the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane. ATF6(N) stimulates the transcription of ER chaperone genes in the nucleus by directly binding to ER stress response elements (ERSE). These ERSE sequences are necessary for the expression of mRNA from many UPR-regulated genes (9Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar, 10Yoshida H. Haze K. Yangi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol.

Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 2001; 76: 7453-7459Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar).IRE1 also activates transcriptional programs in response to ER stress. IRE1 is an ER membrane-anchored endoribonuclease that directs the stress-induced splicing of XBP1 mRNA (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2903) Google Scholar, 12Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Gubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Translation of spliced XBP1 mRNA produces a protein, XBP1(S), that is a potent transcription factor (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2903) Google Scholar). Like ATF6, XBP1(S) can bind to ERSE sequences and induce the transcription of ER chaperone genes (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2903) Google Scholar). XBP1(S) can also activate the transcription of other genes that ATF6 cannot. These genes contain UPR elements (UPRE) that are cis-acting sequences responsive to ER stress and are distinct from the ERSE. Thus, the transcriptional induction of the UPRE is mediated by XBP1(S) through the IRE1-XBP1 pathway (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2903) Google Scholar, 13Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar).Instead of being refolded, misfolded proteins are also targeted in the ER for degradation by the proteasome. The IRE1-XBP1 pathway stimulates ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) increasing the capacity of ER-stressed cells to degrade irrevocably misfolded proteins (14Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). EDEM (ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein) is an important component of the ERAD machinery as the induction of EDEM mRNA expression enhances the degradation of misfolded proteins (15Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hawegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The IRE1-XBP1 pathway activates ERAD by stimulating the transcription of EDEM through XBP1(S) and the UPRE (14Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Therefore, while the ATF6 pathway is important for protein refolding, the IRE1-XBP1 pathway is required for protein degradation (14Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar).Translational attenuation also eases the burden that unfolded proteins place on the ER. PERK is an ER membrane-bound protein kinase that reduces the level of protein synthesis by phosphorylating the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 in response to ER stress (16Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar). Viruses rely on host-cell translation for the production of viral proteins (see Ref. 17Schneider R.J. Mohr I. Trends Biochem.

Korth M.J. Tang N.M. Tan S.-L. Hopkins D.A. Dever T.E. Polyak S.J. Gretch D.R. Katze M.G. Virology. 1997; 230: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 19Taylor D.R Shi S.T. Romano P.R.

Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 2001; 76: 7453-7459Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This shows HCV can alter the typical course of the UPR pathway to promote its survival in hepatocytes.In this study, we show that the IRE1-XBP1 pathway is repressed in cells carrying HCV replicons. This deviation in the UPR suppresses the degradation of misfolded proteins by ERAD. The overall result of a defect in the IRE1-XBP1 pathway is an increase in HCV IRES (internal ribosome entry site)-mediated translation. HCV may utilize this as a strategy to ensure the translation of its viral mRNA. These intracellular events are ultimately linked to the establishment of chronic hepatitis associated with viral infection.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The human hepatoma cell lines Huh7, FCA4, and GS4.3 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml). FCA4 and GS4.3 cells were also cultured in G418 (500 μg/ml; Geneticin; Invitrogen) and are a generous gift from C. Seeger (Fox Chase Cancer Center). Both the FCA4 and GS4.3 cells are a Huh7 cell line stably expressing a HCV subgenomic replicon (21Guo J.T. Bichko V.V. Seeger C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8516-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The HCV replicons expressed in FCA4 and GS4.3 cells are bicistronic RNA constructs consisting of the HCV-IRES (nucleotides 1 to 377 of the 5′-NCR), the neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene, the encephalomyocarditis (EMCV) IRES, which directs the translation of HCV nonstructural proteins NS3 through NS5, and the 3′-NCR (22Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J.-O. Herian U. Theilmann L Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). Wild-type IRE1α and IRE1α-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have been described previously (13Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested for each experiment at 70% confluency unless otherwise indicated. Cells were maintained in 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Replicon-carrying Huh7 cells were cured of HCV RNA using human leukocyte-derived α-interferon (IFN-α) (100 international units/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) (23Blight K.J. McKeating J.A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13001-13014Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Cells expressing HCV replicons were initially passaged twice in the absence of G418. On the third passage, cells were grown with IFN-α. After 3 days, confluent monolayers of cells were trypsinized, plated, and grown for 24 h before adding IFN-α. Cells were passaged four times in the presence of IFN-α. Before the fourth passage, cells were cultured for 3 days in the absence of IFN-α. Cured cell lines were used for experiments at early passage levels.Immunoblotting—XBP1(S) and XBP1U) were detected with anti-XBP1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and anti-XBP1-A polyclonal antibody (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2903) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-neomycin phosphotransferase polyclonal antibody was obtained from Cortex Biochem, mouse anti-actin monclonal antibody was obtained from Neomarkers, and rabbit anti-HCV NS5A polyclonal antibody was a generous gift from S. Sharma (Pennsylvania State University). Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed as described previously (7Tardif K.D. Mori K. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 2001; 76: 7453-7459Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The membranes were probed and developed using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). The band intensities from Western blots were measured with Quantity One software from BioRad.Plasmids—The mammalian expression vectors for human XBP(U), pcDNA-XBP1(unspliced), and human XBP(S), pcDNA-XBP1(spliced) were as described (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2903) Google Scholar). XBP1 transcriptional activity was measured using the 5X UPRE luciferase reporter (a kind gift from R. Prywes, Columbia University), a reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene under the control of five UPRE sequences. This 5× UPRE reporter is identical to p5X ATF6GL3 (24Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vector for the α1-antitrypsin folding incompetent variant NHK, pREP9-NHK, was supplied by N. Hosokawa (Kyoto University) (15Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hawegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Cap-dependent and HCV IRES-dependent translation were monitored with the luciferase reporter plasmid, pRL HCV 1b, as described previously (7Tardif K.D. Mori K. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 2001; 76: 7453-7459Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This construct contains a firefly luciferase gene, the HCV IRES, and a Renilla luciferase gene.RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from Huh7, FCA4, and GS4.3 cells treated with or without tunicamycin (10 μg/ml, 6 h) using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test) and amplified by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA (10 μg) was amplified with the Access Quick RT-PCR System (Promega) using the primers corresponding to nucleotides 412–431 (5′-CCT TGT AGT TGA GAA CCA GG-3′) and 834–853 (5′-GGG GCT TGG TAT ATA TGT GG-3′) of the XBP1 gene. The primers 5′-CAC CCA CAC TGT GCC CAT CTA CG-3′ and 5′-CGA TTT CCC GCT CGG CCG TG-3′ were used to amplify β-actin. RT-PCR products produced from β-actin mRNA are used as a standard for normalization to RT-PCR products produced from XBP1 mRNA. Reactions were carried out in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (2.7 μCi/sample).Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems). Amplifications were conducted in duplicate using the following primers and 6-carboxyfluorescine (6FAM)- and tetrachloro-6-carboxyfluorescine (TAMRA)-labeled probes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences): KIAA0212 Taqman probe, 5′-6FAM-AAG AGG GAG GGC AGG ACC AAG GGTAMRA-3′; KIAA0212–1823, 5′-CAT CTT CGG GAA TTG CCA TG-3′; KIAA0212–1912, 5′-ATG AGG TTT CGG CCT GTG C-3′; HCV Replicon Taqman probe, 5′-6FAM-CCT TCA TCT CCT TGA GCA CGT CCC G-TAMRA-3′; HCV Replicon RNA-FWD, CTT TGA CAG ACT GCA GGT CCT G; HCV Replicon RNA-REV, GCC TTA ACT GTG GAC GCC TTC; 18 S rRNA Taqman probe, 5′-6FAM-TGC TGG CAC CAG ACT TGC CCT C-TAMRA; 18 S rRNA-FWD, 5′-CGG CTA CCA CAT CCA AGG AA-3′; and 18 S rRNA-REV, 5′-GCT GGA ATT ACC GCG GCT-3′. The sequences for the primers and probes were designed using Primer Express software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems). Amplification reactions were performed in a 50 μl mix containing 8% glycerol, 1× TaqMan buffer A (500 mm KCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m EDTA, 600 nm passive reference dye ROX, pH 8.3), 300 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and 600 μm dUTP, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 900 nm forward primer, 900 nm reverse primer, 200 nm probe, 1.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 12.5 units of Moloney Murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 20 units of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), and the template RNA. Reactions were performed under the following conditions: 30 min at 48 °C (reverse transcription reaction); 10 min at 95 °C (heat inactivation of reverse transcriptase and activation of TaqGold polymerase); 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C (PCR amplification). The amounts of KIAA0212 RNA and HCV replicon RNA were calculated by comparison to serially diluted pcDNA3.1-mycKIAA0212 and pS1/ΔS-BM4–5 plasmids (21Guo J.T. Bichko V.V. Seeger C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8516-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The amounts of KIAA0212 or HCV replicon RNA were also normalized to 18 S rRNA.Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Cells at ∼70% confluency were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). Reporter assays were performed as described previously (7Tardif K.D. Mori K. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 2001; 76: 7453-7459Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In each assay, a reporter plasmid containing β-galactosidase under the control of the CMV promoter was used to correct for transfection efficiency.Pulse-Chase Experiments—Huh7 and FCA4 cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes and transfected with 4 μg of pREP9-NHK. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were incubated for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, antibiotics, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 1 h using 200 μCi/ml Trans 35S-label (1175 Ci/mmol; ICN) and chased with complete medium for the indicated times. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Lysates used for immunoprecipitations were normalized to equal trichloroacetic acidprecipitable 35S-labeled protein. Lysates were incubated with goat anti-α1-antitrypsin antibody (US Biologicals) at 4 °C for 2 h. The immune complexes were absorbed to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), then washed with Nonidet P-40 wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.RESULTSXBP1 Expression Is Elevated by HCV Replicons—Human XBP1 mRNA has two open reading frames (ORFs), an intron, and a bZIP domain (Fig. 1A). The 26-base intron of XBP1 mRNA is spliced in response to ER stress (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2903) Google Scholar). This produces a frameshift combining ORF1 with ORF2 and permits the translation of a 376-amino acid transcriptional activator, XBP1(S) (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis using antibodies specific to XBP1(S) demonstrated that the level of XBP1(S) expression is higher in HCV replicon-expressing FCA4 and GS4.3 cells than in Huh7 control cells (Fig. 1B). XBP1(U) is rapidly degraded once the protein is translated from unspliced XBP1 mRNA (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2903) Google Scholar). Consequently, XBP1(U) was detected only in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 1B). Overall, these results indicate that XBP1(S) expression is induced in response to ER stress produced from HCV replicons.RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from cells expressing HCV replicons was performed using primers bordering the 26-base intron and the overlapping region of ORF1 and ORF2 in XBP1 mRNA. The 416-bp fragment amplified from spliced XBP1 mRNA was detected in cells carrying HCV replicons, FCA4 and GS4.3 cells, but not in Huh7 cells (Fig. 1C, compare lane 4 with lanes 5 and 6). A similar band was found in Huh7 cells treated with tunicamycin (Tm) (Fig. 1C, lane 3), a compound that causes ER stress by inhibiting protein N-glycosylation (25Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). A 442-bp RT-PCR product corresponding to unspliced XBP1 mRNA was also generated from RNA prepared from Huh7, FCA4, and GS4.3 cells (Fig. 1C). Overall, RT-PCR confirms that XBP1 mRNA is spliced and that the IRE1-XBP1 pathway is activated in cells carrying HCV replicons.XBP1 Trans-activating Activity Is Inhibited by HCV Replicons—The IRE1-XBP1 pathway and XBP1(S) activate transcription through UPRE sequences. To test the trans-activating activity of XBP1, we used a luciferase reporter plasmid under the transcriptional control of five consecutive UPRE motifs. The UPRE sequence contains the XBP1 binding site (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2903) Google Scholar). FCA4 and GS4.3 cells expressing HCV replicons show reduced 5× UPRE luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 2A). In fact, UPRE-mediated transcription in FCA4 and GS4.3 cells is 4-fold lower than that found in Huh7 cells (Fig. 2A), suggesting that XBP1(S) activity is repressed in cells stably expressing HCV replicons. To determine if this observation is due to clonal differences between the parental Huh7 cells and the Huh7 cells harboring the HCV replicon, we cured GS4.3 cells of the HCV replicon RNA by prolonged treatment with IFN-α (Fig. 2B) and examined the effect on UPRE activity. UPRE activity was three times higher in GS4.3 cured cells compared with untreated GS4.3 cells. Consequently, the decline in UPRE activity can only be attributed to the HCV replicon.Fig. 2XBP1(S) trans-activating activity is inhibited in HCV replicon-expressing cells as measured by 5× UPRE reporter activity. A, 5× UPRE reporter expression in Huh7, FCA4, GS4.3, and GS4.3 cured cells. The reporter plasmids encoding the luciferase gene under the control of the 5× UPRE binding sequences and β-galactosidase under the control of the CMV promoter were cotransfected into Huh7, FCA4, GS4.3, and GS4.3 cured cells. The luciferase activities are presented relative to β-galactosidase activities. B, GS4.3 cells were cured of HCV replicon RNA by prolonged treatment with IFN-α. HCV NS5A and actin were analyzed in Huh7, GS4.3, and GS4.3 cured cells by Western blot using anti-HCV-NS5A antibody and anti-(Pan)actin antibody. The amount of HCV replicon RNA in Huh7, GS4.3, and GS4.3 cured cells was determined by QT-RT-PCR. The amounts HCV replicon RNA were normalized to 18 S rRNA. C, effects of XBP1(U) and XBP1(S) overexpression on 5× UPRE activity in Huh7, FCA4, and GS4.3. Cells were transfected and assayed as described above in the presence of pcDNA-XBP1(unspliced) or pcDNA-XBP1(spliced). The transfected cells were incubated for 16 h in the presence (solid boxes) or absence (open boxes) of 2 μg/ml tunicamycin prior to harvest.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then investigated the effects of XBP1(U) and XBP1(S) overexpression on UPRE luciferase reporter activity in FCA4 and GS4.3 cells. Tunicamycin treatment of FCA4 and GS4.3 cells transfected with vector alone enhanced the reporter expression by a modest 3-fold while Huh7 cells exhibited a 5-fold increase in UPRE activity (Fig. 2C, left panel). More importantly, UPRE expression in tunicamycin-treated HCV replicon-expressing cells was 7–16 times lower than that in Huh7 cells (Fig. 2C, left panel). This indicates that even in the face of chemically induced ER stress UPRE reporter activity is still inhibited in FCA4 and GS4.3 cells. While the overexpression of XBP1(U) slightly increased 5× UPRE reporter expression, UPRE reporter gene expression still remained depressed in HCV replicon-carrying cells (Fig. 2C, middle panel). The over-production of XBP1(S) caused a much more significant increase in expression from the UPRE luciferase reporter even in the absence of ER stress (Fig. 2C, right panel). However, the expression of XBP1(S) did not overcome the suppression of UPRE reporter gene activity in FCA4 and GS4.3 cells (Fig. 2C, right panel).HCV Replicons Inhibit ER-associated Protein Degradation— The IRE1-XBP1 pathway stimulates ERAD activity by upregulating the stress-induced transcription of EDEM (14Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Mouse EDEM is homologous to KIAA0212 in humans sharing 92% identity (15Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hawegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of KIAA0212 revealed that mRNA expression of KIAA0212 is not induced in FCA4 and GS4.3 cells while tunicamycin treatment of Huh7 cells resulted in a 4-fold increase in KIAA0212 mRNA as expected (Fig. 3A). Thus, the suppression of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway inhibits the transcription of KIAA0212 to elevated levels in response to ER stress.Fig. 3ER-associated protein degradation is reduced in cells carrying HCV replicons. A, QT-RT-PCR analysis of KIAA0212 mRNA (hEDEM). Total RNA was isolated from Huh7, FCA4, and GS4.3 cells cultured in the presence or absence of tunicamycin (10 μg/ml) for 6 h before harvest. The amounts of KIAA0212 were normalized to 18 S rRNA. B, degradation of the NHK variant of α1-antitrypsin in Huh7 and FCA4 cells. Huh7 and FCA4 cells were transfected with pREP9-NHK, 35S-pulse-labeled for 1 h, and chased for the indicated times. NHK was immunoprecipitated with anti-α1-antitrypsin antibody. The immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next investigated whether a defect in the IRE1-XBP1 pathway would also influence ERAD and the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER. The null Hong Kong (NHK) variant is a mutant form of the α1-antitrypsin protease inhibitor that is misfolded in the ER and degraded through ERAD (26Sifers R.N. Brashears-Macatee S. Kidd V.J. Muensch H. Woo S.L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7330-7335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This makes the stability of the NHK protein an excellent measure of ERAD activity. To analyze NHK protein stability in FCA4 and Huh7 cells, cells were transfected with a NHK expression plasmid, 35S-pulse labeled for 1 h, and chased for 5 h. The protein levels of the NHK variant were examined by immunoprecipitating 35S-labeled cell lysates using antibody specific to α1-antitrypsin. The amount of NHK immunoprecipitated from FCA4 cells was very stable over the course of the chase period (Fig. 3B, lanes 5–8). In contrast, NHK was effectively degraded in Huh7 cells (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4). This shows that cells expressing HCV replicons are incapable of effectively degrading misfolded proteins through ERAD due a fundamental flaw in the IRE1-XBP1 pathway.HCV IRES Translation Is Elevated in Cell"

Some of these IAPs are capable of ubiquitinating themselves and their interacting proteins through the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity of their RING domain. The Drosophila IAP antagonists Reaper, Hid, and Grim can accelerate the degradation of Drosophila IAP1 and some mammalian IAPs by promoting their ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity.

Smac binding to c-IAP via its N-terminal IAP-binding motif is the prerequisite for this effect, which is further supported by the findings that Smac N-terminal peptide is sufficient to enhance c-IAP1 ubiquitination, and Smac no longer promotes the ubiquitination of mutant c-IAP1 lacking all three baculovirus IAP repeat domains. In addition, different IAPs require the same ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UbcH5a and UbcH6 for their ubiquitination.

Apoptosis is genetically controlled cell death that is essential for development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. Both excessive and insufficient cell death can lead to anomalies or diseases. The molecular machinery involved in apoptosis is highly conserved across divergent species. The apoptotic death of cells requires proteolytic activation of caspases that are synthesized as latent proenzymes. Once activated, caspases cleave a wide range of molecules that eventually result in the dismantlement of cells. Caspases are therefore tightly controlled within the cells. Active caspases can be specifically inhibited by the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP), 1The abbreviations used are: IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis; BIR, baculovirus IAP repeat; WT, wild type; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; IBM, IAP-binding motif. a family of proteins containing one to three copies of characteristic baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) (1Liston P.

Despite the overall sequence differences, these IAP antagonists share a conserved N-terminal IAP-binding motif (IBM) or Reaper/Hid/Grim motif. This motif is indispensable and sufficient for counteracting IAP inhibition. The small subunit of active caspase-9 also binds to XIAP through the same IBM produced by auto-processing (14Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chai J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D.

This mechanism allows these IAP antagonists to compete with caspases for IAP binding and consequently relieves caspases and promotes cell death. Some IAPs also regulate apoptosis through the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) activity of their RING domain (1Liston P. Fong W.G. Korneluk R.G.

On the other hand, the E3 activity of IAP also leads to the ubiquitination of IAPs themselves, and such autoubiquitination can be enhanced by Reaper, Hid, and Grim (22Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P.

An alternatively spliced form of Smac, Smac3, was recently reported to promote XIAP ubiquitination and degradation (28Fu J. Jin Y. Arend L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52660-52672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate that these IAP antagonists accelerate the disposal of IAPs in addition to releasing captive caspases from IAPs. Moreover, the mammalian IAP-binding protein Omi/HtrA2 can directly degrade IAP molecules through its serine protease activity (29Yang Q.H. Church-Hajduk R. Ren J. Newton M.L. Du C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 30Srinivasula S.M. Gupta S. Datta P. Zhang Z. Hegde R. Cheong N. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Five of the eight human IAPs have a C-terminal RING domain (32Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the characteristics of the E3 activity of various IAPs. Even though the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of XIAP have been reported to be enhanced by Smac3 rather than Smac, it is not known if c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 are also modulated by their cognate antagonists via ubiquitin/proteasomal degradation. In this paper we show that Smac stimulates the rapid degradation of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 but not XIAP and Livin in HeLa cells, although Smac does promote auto-ubiquitination of all four of these human IAPs. These human IAPs require the same ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) UbcH5a and UbcH6 for their E3 activity in vitro. We also demonstrate that c-IAP degradation promoted by Smac is dependent on RING E3 activity and direct binding to Smac, and the Smac N-terminal peptide is sufficient to accelerate c-IAP1 auto-ubiquitination. These observations, together with the a recent report that Smac is recruited by the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) signaling pathway to disrupt TRAF2-c-IAP1 complex (33Deng Y. Ren X. Yang L. Lin Y. Wu X. Cell. 2003; 115: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), indicate that Smac may selectively down-regulate the levels of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, thereby facilitating caspase-8 activation initiated by TNFR signaling in vivo. Antibodies and Reagents—The polyclonal antibodies that recognize, respectively, the residues 527–546 of human c-IAP1, residues 507–524 of human c-IAP2, and residues 244–263 of human XIAP, and the monoclonal antibody against human ubiquitin were purchased from R & D Systems. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-GST antibody, anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody were from Sigma. The monoclonal anti-Livin antibody was from IMGENEX, and the monoclonal anti-actin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The polyclonal antiserum against Smac was generated by immunizing rabbits with recombinant Smac protein as described previously (7Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). The mammalian ubiquitin, rabbit ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), and various recombinant human E2 were from Boston Biochem, Inc. Plasmids—The plasmids for the GST fusion proteins of human c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and XIAP (29Yang Q.H. Church-Hajduk R. Ren J. Newton M.L. Du C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and the C-terminal His9-tagged mature form of Smac (7Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar) have been described elsewhere. The cDNAs for Livin α and Livin β were individually inserted into the pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate GST fusion proteins. The p3×FLAG-CMV-7 vector (Sigma) was used for the expression of IAP proteins in mammalian cells. The N-terminal ubiquitin-fused and C-terminal c-Myc-tagged Smac wild type (WT) and the Ala1 deletion mutant (ΔA) were generated by PCR and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(–) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) according to the reported technique (34Varshavsky A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 578-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 35Baker R.T. Smith S.A. Marano R. McKee J. Board P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25381-25386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation of the conserved His residue to Ala in the RING domain of respective IAPs (c-IAP1 H588A, c-IAP2 H574A, XIAP H467A, Livin α H269A, and Livin β H251A) was made using the QuickChange Multisite-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Full-length c-IAP1 and XIAP and different c-IAP1 truncation mutants were generated by PCR and subcloned into the pTYB11 (New England Biolabs). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—All of the recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The GST-fused IAP proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography, followed by Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography if necessary. The C-terminal His9-tagged wild type Smac and Smac ΔA were purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The non-tagged full-length c-IAP1 and XIAP and the truncated c-IAP1 mutants were purified from the Chitin affinity column after dithiothreitol induction according to the manufacturer's protocols (New England Biolabs). The protein concentrations were determined by the modified Bradford method (36Zor T. Selinger Z. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). In Vitro Ubiquitination Assays—In vitro ubiquitination assays were carried out as described previously (29Yang Q.H. Church-Hajduk R. Ren J. Newton M.L. Du C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). IAP proteins (200 nm) were incubated with or without Smac for 2 h at 30 °C in a reaction system containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm Mg-ATP, 20 μm mammalian ubiquitin, 100 nm rabbit E1, and 400 nm recombinant human E2. The reactions were stopped by adding equal volumes of 2× SDS sample loading buffer followed by Western blot analysis. Transfection of Cultured Cells—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded onto 6-well plates the day before transfection and transfected at ∼70% confluence by using Lipofectin combined with Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The IAP expression plasmids (3 μg each for c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and XIAP, and 250 ng each for Livin α and Livin β) together with 2.5 μg of Smac expression plasmids or pcDNA3.1(–) blank plasmid were used for single-well transfection in the absence of antibiotics. The cells were harvested 12 h after the transfection and lysed with 0.5% CHAPS in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1mm dithiothreitol. The lysates were centrifuged, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were quantified by the modified Bradford method (36Zor T. Selinger Z. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked with 5% milk and probed with antibodies as indicated in the text. The signals were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence method. Smac Prevents the Accumulation of Both c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 in HeLa Cells—To investigate the effect of Smac on IAP protein levels, we transfected HeLa cells with the expression vectors for Smac and various IAPs. The ubiquitin fusion technique was used here to secure the production of mature Smac protein with the expected N-terminal AVPI motif (6Tenev T. Zachariou A. Wilson R. Paul A. Meier P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5118-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 37Hunter A.M. Kottachchi D. Lewis J. Duckett C.S. Korneluk R.G. Liston P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7494-7499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The HeLa cells transiently transfected with c-IAP1 or c-IAP2 expression vector produced not only the expected full-length c-IAP1 or c-IAP2 but also the multiple higher molecular mass forms that are characteristic of ubiquitinated products (lanes 2 and 4 of Fig. 1). This was consistent with the previous reports that both c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 are E3s and are capable of directing auto-ubiquitination (16Huang H. Joazeiro C.A. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26661-26664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). In contrast, the transiently expressed XIAP, under the same conditions, showed only one or two bands above the major band of full-length XIAP (lane 6 of Fig. 1). Surprisingly, the protein levels of both c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, but not XIAP, were significantly decreased when the mature form of Smac was co-expressed (lanes 2, 4, and 7 of Fig. 1). Previous works have revealed that the Drosophila functional homologs of Smac, Reaper, Hid, and Grim can promote the degradation of mammalian IAP proteins bearing normal E3 activity (23Yoo S.J. Huh J.R. Muro I. Yu H. Wang L. Wang S.L. Feldman R.M. Clem R.J. Muller H.A. Hay B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 24Hays R. Wickline L. Cagan R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Ryoo H.D. Bergmann A. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Steller H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 26Holley C.L. Olson M.R. Colon-Ramos D.A. Kornbluth S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Two of these Smac homologs, Grim and Reaper, also reduce the levels of IAPs by suppressing global protein synthesis (23Yoo S.J. Huh J.R. Muro I. Yu H. Wang L. Wang S.L. Feldman R.M. Clem R.J. Muller H.A. Hay B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 26Holley C.L. Olson M.R. Colon-Ramos D.A. Kornbluth S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It was unlikely that the decrease of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 was caused by the Smac-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis because XIAP under similar conditions was unaffected. To test whether Smac stimulated the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of both c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, we mutated His588 in c-IAP1 and His574 in c-IAP2 to Ala. This conserved His residue in the RING finger domain has proven important for the IAP E3 activity (22Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). The effects of Smac on these IAP E3 activities were examined as described below. Smac Promotes the Degradation of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 by Enhancing Their Auto-ubiquitination in HeLa Cells—The H588A mutant c-IAP1 exhibited a much higher expression level than the wild type in HeLa cells (compare lanes 3 and 6 of Fig. 2A). The amount of wild type c-IAP1 was also dramatically increased by the addition of proteasome inhibitor MG132 to the culture medium (lane 10, Fig. 2A). MG132, however, did not cause a significant increase in the H588A c-IAP1 protein level (lane 13). These observations were in agreement with the previous report that c-IAP1 is continuously down-regulated by ubiquitination-dependent degradation, and such ubiquitination is mediated by the E3 activity of c-IAP1 itself (22Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). In the presence of MG132, co-expression of wild type Smac led to a reduction in the level of non-ubiquitinated and mono-/di-ubiquitinated wild type c-IAP1 and a concomitant increase in the level of highly ubiquitinated c-IAP1 forms (lane 11 of Fig. 2A). In the absence of MG132, co-expression of Smac resulted in nearly complete disappearance of c-IAP1 (lane 4 of Fig. 2A). These data indicated that Smac promoted the poly-ubiquitination and degradation of c-IAP1. It is known that the processed Smac and other IAP antagonists have a conserved N-terminal IBM with an initial Ala residue. Mutation of this Ala or deletion of the IBM abolishes the specific binding of these proteins to IAP (38Chai J. Du C. Wu J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 39Srinivasula S.M. Datta P. Fan X.J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Huang Z. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36152-36157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To assess whether Smac enhancement of c-IAP1 ubiquitination and degradation requires the same binding, we co-transfected c-IAP1 with a Smac mutant lacking the initial Ala (Smac ΔA) that was also produced by using the ubiquitin fusion expression vector. As expected, Smac ΔA did not enhance the auto-ubiquitination of c-IAP1 (Compare lanes 5 and 3 and lanes 13 and 10 of Fig. 2A), suggesting that the specific binding of Smac to c-IAP1 via its IBM is required for Smac to enhance the auto-ubiquitination of c-IAP1. In agreement with the above observations, Smac did not cause a drastic change in the level of E3-negative H588A c-IAP1 either in the absence or in the presence of MG132 (lanes 6 and 7, and lanes 13 and 14 of Fig. 2A, respectively). Smac likewise strongly promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of c-IAP2 (Fig. 2B). Mutation of His574 to Ala in c-IAP2 also significantly increased the expression level of c-IAP2 (Fig. 2B). As mentioned above, the level of c-IAP1 was significantly elevated by the addition of MG132. In contrast, c-IAP2 did not show such a significant change when MG132 was added (compare lanes 3 and 10 in Fig. 2B). Such a difference made it reasonable to speculate that in the absence of Smac, the E3 of c-IAP2 was much less active than c-IAP1 in directing its auto-ubiquitination. It should be noted that although His588 in c-IAP1 and His574 in c-IAP2 are critical for their E3 activities, mutation of this residue to Ala greatly reduced but did not completely abolish their E3 activity, as revealed by the background ubiquitinated product ladders (lanes 6, 7, 13, and 14 of Fig. 2). This residual activity was also observed in an in vitro ubiquitination assay using purified mutant c-IAP proteins (data not shown). Smac Does Not Promote the Degradation of XIAP and Livin in HeLa Cells—XIAP has been reported to be ubiquitinated by its own E3 activity when expressed in HEK 293T cells, and this auto-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation is stimulated by Reaper (26Holley C.L. Olson M.R. Colon-Ramos D.A. Kornbluth S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this current study, XIAP transiently expressed in HeLa cells was ubiquitinated as well; however, mono-ubiquitination rather than poly-ubiquitination of XIAP seemed to be the major product (Fig. 3A). Similar to c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, XIAP ubiquitination also depended on its E3 activity, for the H467A E3-negative mutant gave either no band or a much weaker mono-ubiquitination band (lanes 3, 5, 8, and 10 of Fig. 3A). Although more poly-ubiquitinated XIAP products could be detected in the presence of MG132, they were much less significant compared with that of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2. Unlike that of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, the overall amount of XIAP was not quite affected by the co-transfected Smac, although Smac still promoted XIAP ubiquitination. In the absence of MG132, co-expression of Smac only had a negligible effect on the level of XIAP (lane 4 of Fig. 3A), whereas under similar conditions Smac reduced both c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 to a nearly non-detectable level (Fig. 2). This result was consistent with the report by Silke et al. (27Silke J. Kratina T. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Vaux D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 4313-4321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that Smac does not promote XIAP degradation. Unexpectedly, the Smac ΔA mutant, despite its failure to bind to various IAPs (Fig. 4), also stimulated the auto-ubiquitination of XIAP and Livin (lanes 4 and 5 and 11 and 12 in Fig. 3). The reason for this IBM-independent acceleration on XIAP and Livin ubiquitination remains unknown. Smac effectively stimulates auto-ubiquitination of Livin α, which slightly promoted the degradation of Livin α (lane 4 of Fig. 3B). Livin β, an alternatively spliced form of Livin, lacks 18 residues between the BIR and the RING domains compared with Livin α (40Vucic D. Stennicke H.R. Pisabarro M.T. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1359-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 41Ashhab Y. Alian A. Polliack A. Panet A. Ben Yehuda D. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The transfection results of Livin β were basically the same as that of Livin α (data not shown). In contrast to c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, the mutation of the corresponding His residue in the RING finger domain of XIAP and Livin did not considerably enhance their expression, although the mutation did greatly reduce their E3 activity. Taken together, these observations suggested that the levels of XIAP and Livin were not mainly regulated by auto-ubiquitination/proteasomal degradation in HeLa cells. Different IAP Proteins Require the Same Ubiquitin-conjugating Enzymes in Vitro for Their E3 Activity—To compare the E3 activities of these human IAPs, we used an in vitro ubiquitination assay system containing purified ubiquitin, E1, and E2 to screen a panel of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes available from Boston Biochem, Inc. All of these IAP proteins exhibited strong E3 activity when UbcH5a and UbcH6 were used as the E2 as manifested by the characteristic poly-ubiquitination ladders (lanes 4 and 7 of Fig. 5). Smac Does Not Promote Auto-ubiquitination of XIAP in Vitro—The purified XIAP was active in directing poly-ubiquitination. However, the auto-ubiquitination of XIAP was not enhanced by Smac. The amount of ubiquitinated forms of XIAP with a high molecular mass of ∼150 kDa was even slightly reduced by Smac (Fig. 6). Smac Promotes Auto-ubiquitination of c-IAP1 in Vitro through Specific Association with the BIR Domains—The observation that Smac promotes c-IAP1 auto-ubiquitination in HeLa cells was further confirmed in vitro by using UbcH6 as the E2. Smac at equimolar to c-IAP1 enhanced c-IAP1 autoubiquitination to the maximum (lane 5, Fig. 7A). Consistent with the transfection result, SmacΔA failed to promote such auto-ubiquitination (lane 7 of Fig. 7A). Similar results were also obtained with Smac and c-IAP2 (data not shown). The Smac mutant lacking the initial Ala residue did not bind IAP proteins and consequently did not promote the E3 activity of either c-IAP1 or c-IAP2 in HeLa cells or in vitro. These results strongly indicated that the interaction between the IBM of Smac and the BIR domains of IAP was essential and that the BIR domains may regulate the E3 activity of the RING finger. To verify this we made stepwise deletion of the first BIR (ΔBIR1, residues 1–161), the first two BIRs (ΔBIR1–2, residues 1–265), or all the three BIR domains (ΔBIR1–2-3, residues 1–339) from c-IAP1. All these mutants and the full-length wild type c-IAP1 were purified as a non-tagged form by using the pTYB11 intein system (New England Biolabs). The c-IAP1 mutants with one, two, or all three BIR domains deleted were still active in directing their auto-ubiquitination (Fig. 7A). The basal activity of ΔBIR1 and ΔBIR1–2 was very low but was significantly enhanced by Smac, whereas the basal activity of ΔBIR1–2-3 was comparably high and could no longer be enhanced by Smac. This suggested that the second and the third BIR domains of c-IAP1 strongly inhibit the E3 activity of the C-terminal RING. Smac binding to the BIR domains of c-IAP1 may help expose the RING domain to generate a higher E3 activity. Smac N-terminal Hexapeptide Is Sufficient to Stimulate the Ubiquitin-Protein Isopeptide Ligase Activity of c-IAP1—Previous work has shown that the N-terminal peptides of Smac can mimic Smac protein in removing the inhibition of XIAP on caspase-3 activation (38Chai J.

https://openalex.org/W2015951549,"Strong inward rectifier potassium (Kir2) channels are important in the control of cell excitability, and their functions are modulated by interactions with intracellular proteins. Here we identified a complex of scaffolding/trafficking proteins in brain that associate with Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 channels. By using a combination of affinity interaction pulldown assays and co-immunoprecipitations from brain and transfected cells, we demonstrated that a complex composed of SAP97, CASK, Veli, and Mint1 associates with Kir2 channels via the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. We further demonstrated by using <i>in vitro</i> protein interaction assays that SAP97, Veli-1, or Veli-3 binds directly to the Kir2.2 C terminus and recruits CASK. Co-immunoprecipitations indicated that specific Veli isoforms participate in forming distinct protein complexes in brain, where Veli-1 stably associates with CASK and SAP97, Veli-2 associates with CASK and Mint1, and Veli-3 associates with CASK, SAP97, and Mint1. Additionally, immunocytochemistry of rat cerebellum revealed overlapping expression of Kir2.2, SAP97, CASK, Mint1, with Veli-1 in the granule cell layer and Veli-3 in the molecular layer. We propose a model whereby Kir2.2 associates with distinct SAP97-CASK-Veli-Mint1 complexes. In one complex, SAP97 interacts directly with the Kir2 channels and recruits CASK, Veli, and Mint1. Alternatively, Veli-1 or Veli-3 interacts directly with the Kir2 channels and recruits CASK and SAP97; association of Mint1 with the complex requires Veli-3. Expression of Kir2.2 in polarized epithelial cells resulted in targeting of the channels to the basolateral membrane and co-localization with SAP97 and CASK, whereas a dominant interfering form of CASK caused the channels to mislocalize. Therefore, CASK appears to be a central protein of a macromolecular complex that participates in trafficking and plasma membrane localization of Kir2 channels."
https://openalex.org/W2136853458,"We have generated a panel of potent, selective monoclonal antibodies that bind human and mouse αvβ6 integrin with high affinity (up to 15 pm). A subset of these antibodies blocked the binding of αvβ6 to the transforming growth factor-β1 latency-associated peptide with IC50 values as low as 18 pm, and prevented the subsequent αvβ6-mediated activation of transforming growth factor-β1. The antibodies also inhibited αvβ6 binding to fibronectin. The blocking antibodies form two biochemical classes. One class, exemplified by the ligand-mimetic antibody 6.8G6, bound to the integrin in a divalent cation-dependent manner, contained an RGD motif or a related sequence in CDR3 of the heavy chain, was blocked by RGD-containing peptides, and was internalized by αvβ6-expressing cells. Despite containing an RGD sequence, 6.8G6 was specific for αvβ6 and showed no cross-reactivity with the RGD-binding integrins αvβ3, αvβ8,or αIIbβ3. The nonligand-mimetic blocking antibodies, exemplified by 6.3G9, were cation-independent, were not blocked by RGD-containing peptides, were not internalized, and did not contain RGD or related sequences. These two classes of antibody were unable to bind simultaneously to αvβ6, suggesting that they may bind overlapping epitopes. The “ligand-mimetic” antibodies are the first to be described for αvβ6 and resemble those described for αIIbβ3. We also report for the first time the relative abilities of divalent cations to promote αvβ6 binding to latency-associated peptide and to the ligand-mimetic antibodies. These antibodies should provide valuable tools to study the ligand-receptor interactions of αvβ6 as well as the role of αvβ6 in vivo. We have generated a panel of potent, selective monoclonal antibodies that bind human and mouse αvβ6 integrin with high affinity (up to 15 pm). A subset of these antibodies blocked the binding of αvβ6 to the transforming growth factor-β1 latency-associated peptide with IC50 values as low as 18 pm, and prevented the subsequent αvβ6-mediated activation of transforming growth factor-β1. The antibodies also inhibited αvβ6 binding to fibronectin. The blocking antibodies form two biochemical classes. One class, exemplified by the ligand-mimetic antibody 6.8G6, bound to the integrin in a divalent cation-dependent manner, contained an RGD motif or a related sequence in CDR3 of the heavy chain, was blocked by RGD-containing peptides, and was internalized by αvβ6-expressing cells. Despite containing an RGD sequence, 6.8G6 was specific for αvβ6 and showed no cross-reactivity with the RGD-binding integrins αvβ3, αvβ8,or αIIbβ3. The nonligand-mimetic blocking antibodies, exemplified by 6.3G9, were cation-independent, were not blocked by RGD-containing peptides, were not internalized, and did not contain RGD or related sequences. These two classes of antibody were unable to bind simultaneously to αvβ6, suggesting that they may bind overlapping epitopes. The “ligand-mimetic” antibodies are the first to be described for αvβ6 and resemble those described for αIIbβ3. We also report for the first time the relative abilities of divalent cations to promote αvβ6 binding to latency-associated peptide and to the ligand-mimetic antibodies. These antibodies should provide valuable tools to study the ligand-receptor interactions of αvβ6 as well as the role of αvβ6 in vivo. Integrins are heterodimeric cell-surface receptors that have been implicated in regulating a variety of processes by mediating cell adhesion, migration, and signaling (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6852) Google Scholar). At least 24 different integrin heterodimers can be formed from the 18 α and 8 β chains that have been identified. The pairing of α and β subunits determines the ligand binding specificity of integrins. For example, some integrin heterodimers specifically bind to ligands containing the tripeptide sequence RGD. This group of RGD-binding integrins includes the platelet integrin αIIbβ3, some of the β1 integrins, and all of the αv integrins. Although the αv subunit can pair with multiple β subunits (β1, β3, β5, β6, and β8), the β6 subunit can only pair with αv and not with any other integrin α chains. αvβ6 is unique in that its expression is restricted to epithelial cells (2Breuss J.M. Gillett N. Lu L. Sheppard D. Pytela R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1521-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although it is present at low or undetectable levels in normal adult tissue, αvβ6 is rapidly up-regulated during development, injury, wound healing, and neoplasia (2Breuss J.M. Gillett N. Lu L.

As a result of binding to these ligands, αvβ6 can mediate cell adhesion, spreading, migration, proliferation, and activation of latent TGF-β. Although the importance of interactions between RGD-binding integrins and extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin is well established, the role of LAP as an integrin ligand is just beginning to emerge. There are three different human LAP gene products (LAPβ1, LAPβ2, and LAPβ3) that are produced as N-terminal prodomains of the three closely related TGF-β isoforms (TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3). The TGF-βs are multifunctional cytokines that influence numerous cellular processes including regulation of inflammation, production of extracellular matrix, and regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Each TGF-β isoform is expressed as a propeptide with the corresponding LAP at its N terminus. Following translation, the propeptide undergoes intracellular proteolysis, and the resultant LAP and TGF-β fragments associate to form a complex comprising a dimer of TGF-β noncovalently associated with a dimer of LAP (termed the “small latent complex”). This complex associates with the latent TGF-β-binding protein (LTBP-1) prior to secretion, in what is referred to as the “large latent complex” (12Miyazono K. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6407-6415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the name implies, the latent TGF-β complex is inactive and requires activation in order to produce active cytokine (13Gleizes P.E. Munger J.S. Nunes I. Harpel J.G. Mazzieri R. Noguera I. Rifkin D.B. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 14Lawrence D.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 219: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Munger J.S.

Although a number of in vitro activation methods have been described (e.g. low pH, proteolysis, radiation, and interactions with proteins such as thrombospondin and αvβ6 integrin), the mechanism(s) of physiological TGF-β activation have not been fully elucidated (for reviews see Refs. 13Gleizes P.E.

J. 2003; 369: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), as well as α8β1 (19Lu M. Munger J.S. Steadele M. Busald C. Tellier M. Schnapp L.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4641-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), have been shown to bind to RGD sequences contained in LAPβ1 and LAPβ3 in vitro, whereas LAPβ2, in which the RGD sequence is replaced by SGD, does not interact with any of these integrins. These interactions, as with other integrin-ligand interactions, are dependent on the presence of divalent cations. Integrins αvβ6 and αvβ8, but not αvβ1, αvβ5, or α8β1, are able to activate latent TGF-β1 upon binding, and αvβ6, as shown recently, can activate latent TGF-β3 (20Annes J.P. Rifkin D.B. Munger J.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The process by which αvβ6 activates latent TGF-β is not fully understood, although one model proposes that integrin binding induces a conformational change in the latent TGF-β complex, which allows binding of TGF-β to its type II receptor (11Munger J.S. Huang X. Kawakatsu H. Griffiths M.J. Dalton S.L. Wu J. Pittet J.F. Kaminski N. Garat C. Matthay M.A. Rifkin D.B. Sheppard D. Cell. 1999; 96: 319-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). The ability of αvβ6 to activate TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 offers a novel mechanism for local activation of these multifunctional cytokines and suggests that this integrin may contribute to the onset of TGF-β-mediated disease processes. The in vitro data are supported by studies with β6-null mice, which have low levels of inflammation in the lung and skin, consistent with inactivation of TGF-β (21Huang X.Z. Wu J.F. Cass D. Erle D.J. Corry D. Young S.G. Farese Jr., R.V. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These mice are also protected in a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model, suggesting that inhibition of αvβ6 might provide a therapeutic benefit by blocking TGF-β activation locally in affected tissues. In addition, blocking the binding of αvβ6 to other ligands, such as fibronectin, might be useful for treating TGF-β-independent disease processes by inhibiting the adhesive or migratory functions of αvβ6. The development of monoclonal antibodies that bind to specific integrin heterodimers and block ligand binding and functional activity has provided an important tool for understanding the structure and function of integrins. For this reason, we were interested in generating reagents that would specifically bind to the αvβ6 heterodimer and block its ability to activate latent TGF-β. We describe here the generation and characterization of selective, high affinity monoclonal antibodies that block the binding of αvβ6 to LAP. These antibodies were generated by immunizing β6-deficient mice with the αvβ6 integrin, allowing for the production of antibodies that recognize both the human and murine αvβ6 integrins. Among these antibodies are the first ligand-mimetic antibodies to be described for αvβ6. These antibodies provide a means to study the mechanism of αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activation in vitro, and to test whether αvβ6 inhibition can effectively block TGF-β-mediated pathologies in vivo. Materials—The β6 -/- mice were prepared as described (21Huang X.Z. Wu J.F. Cass D. Erle D.J. Corry D. Young S.G. Farese Jr., R.V. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Recombinant human TGF-β1 LAP was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antibody 10D5 (9Huang X. Wu J. Spong S. Sheppard D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2189-2195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The L230 (anti-αv) and AP-3 (anti-β3) hybridomas were purchased from ATCC, and the antibodies were purified from the supernatant of saturated cultures by affinity chromatography on immobilized protein A. The anti-β8 antibody 14E7 was a generous gift of Steve Nishimura (University of California, San Francisco). Isotyping of antibodies was carried out using the Isostrip kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The human β6-transfected SW480 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma) cell line (SW480β6) was prepared as described (8Weinacker A. Chen A. Agrez M. Cone R.I. Nishimura S. Wayner E. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6940-6948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide acetyl-GGLRRGDRPSLRYAMDS-CONH2, derived from the 6.8G6 CDR sequence, was kindly provided by Dr. J. H. Cuervo (Biogen) and was prepared using standard solid-phase synthetic methods. The SCC-14 cell line was a gift from Dr. H. Larjava (University of British Columbia) and Dr. R. Grenman (University of Turku, Finland). HT-29 cells were purchased from the ATCC. Purification of hsαvβ6—The recombinant human secreted αvβ6 protein (hsαvβ6) was purified from the supernatant of transfected CHO cells, essentially as described (8Weinacker A. Chen A. Agrez M. Cone R.I. Nishimura S. Wayner E. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6940-6948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by affinity chromatography using anti-αv antibody L230. Purified L230 was cross-linked to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) at a ratio of 4.8 mg of anti-body/ml resin. The αvβ6 supernatant was loaded (0.5 mg of antibody/ml resin) onto the L230 affinity column, and the column was washed with 10 column volumes each of the following: 1) 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2; 2) 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2; and 3) 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The hsαvβ6 was eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, into 1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0 (1:10 by volume). Protein was dialyzed with several changes against PBS and stored at -20 °C. Biotinylation of Proteins—Purified hsαvβ6 protein or antibody (2 mg) was incubated with 10 m equivalents of sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in 1 ml of 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.3, at 25 °C for 45 min. Unreacted label was removed by desalting on 20 ml of Sephadex G-25M (Amersham Biosciences). Generation of Stably β6-Transfected FDC-P1 and NIH3T3 Cells—Murine β6-transfected NIH3T3 and FDC-P1 cells were generated by electroporating parent cell lines with a DNA construct containing full-length murine β6 cDNA cloned from murine lung cDNA and a neomycin selectable marker. Stable transfected cells were selected by passaging cells in culture medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 14 days followed by flow cytometry to isolate cells expressing the highest level of surface-expressed murine β6. Transfected FDC-P1 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 4 mml-glutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS, 2.5% mouse IL-3 culture supplement, and +1.5 mg/ml active G418. Transfected NIH3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml active G418. Generation of Human LAP-Fc—The 833-bp human LAP cDNA sequence was cloned from human kidney cDNA using reverse-transcriptase PCR. A mutation of cysteine to serine was incorporated at amino acid 33 to eliminate aggregation during production of protein (22Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Mutant human LAP cDNA was then ligated with the human IgG1 Fc cDNA (23Cunningham B.A. Rutishauser U. Gall W.E. Gottlieb P.D. Waxdal M.J. Edelman G.M. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3161-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) into the PV90 expression vector (24Brezinsky S.C.G. Chiang G.G. Szilvasi A. Mohan S. Sharpiro R.I. MacLean A. Sisk W. Thill G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 277: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). CHO cells were transfected with the human LAP-IgG1 expression construct, and stable transfected cells producing fusion protein were selected by expanding in α minus minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). The protein was purified from the supernatant of CHO cell cultures on protein A-Sepharose 4 FF, as described for the purification of monoclonal antibodies. Production of Monoclonal Antibodies—β6 -/- mice were immunized by intraperitoneal injection with hsαvβ6 in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (fusion 6, designated with the prefix 6). Alternatively, β6 -/- mice were immunized with β6-transfected NIH3T3 cells, and the same mice were immunized intraperitoneally at an adjacent site with 100 μl of CFA (fusion 7, designated with prefix 7). Two weeks and 4 weeks after the initial immunization mice were boosted similarly with the same reagents with the exception that incomplete Freund's adjuvant was used in place of CFA. Three days prior to isolating spleens for fusions mice were immunized with 12.5 μg of purified recombinant human αvβ6 protein by both intraperitoneal and intravenous injection. Mice were sacrificed and spleens were removed, and B-cells were teased into single cell suspensions and immortalized by fusion to a drug-selectable cell fusion partner (FL653). Screening for anti-αvβ6 antibodies was carried out as described under “Results,” and select clones were subcloned using flow cytometry and stored frozen. Purification of Antibodies—Antibodies were purified from hybridoma supernatants using protein A affinity chromatography. For the IgG2a isotype antibodies, the supernatant was directly loaded onto protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with PBS, and the IgG fraction was eluted using 25 mm phosphoric acid, 100 mm NaCl, pH 2.8, into 1:20 volume of 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.6. For the murine IgG1 isotype antibodies, the super-natant was adjusted to 1.5 m glycine, 3 m NaCl, pH 8.9, prior to loading, and the column was washed with 25 mm sodium phosphate, 3 m NaCl, pH 8.6, prior to elution. The eluate from the protein A chromatographic step was adjusted to pH 8.6 using 2 m Tris base, diluted 10-fold with water, and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (20 mg of protein/ml resin) that had been equilibrated in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 25 mm NaCl, pH 8.6. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of equilibration buffer, and protein was eluted using 25 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. Solutions of purified protein were sterile-filtered (0.22 μm) and stored at -70 °C until use. Flow Cytometry—Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspended in FC buffer (1× PBS, 2% FBS, 0.1% NaN3,1mm CaCl2,and1mm MgCl2). 0.2 × 105 cells were then incubated on ice for 1 h in FC buffer containing hybridoma supernatant or purified antibody in a total volume of 100 μl. After incubation cells were washed two times with ice-cold FACS buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of FC buffer containing 5 μg/ml phycoerythrinconjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were then washed two times with ice-cold FC buffer and resuspended in 200 μl of FC buffer. Binding of the labeled secondary antibody was monitored by flow cytometry. Solid-phase αvβ6 Binding Assay (ELISA)—A 96-well microtiter plate was coated with 50 μl/well of 5 μg/ml hsαvβ6 at 4 °C, overnight. The plate was washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS in an automated plate washer, and 180 μl/well of 3% BSA in TBS was added for 1 h at 25 °C to block nonspecific binding. The plate was washed as above, and dilutions of either hybridoma supernatant (for screening assays) or purified antibody (for characterization) in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml BSA) and either 1 mm CaCl2 + 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, or 10 mm EDTA were added (50 μl/well). The plate was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C, washed, and incubated for 1 h with 50 μl/well of peroxide-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG + A + M antibody (Cappel/ICN, 1:4000 dilution) or goat anti-human Fc antibody (Cappel/ICN, 1:4000 dilution). Bound antibody was detected using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. In the antibody competition experiments, biotinylated antibody (0.1 μg/ml) and unlabeled antibody were added simultaneously, and the secondary antibody was substituted with 50 μl/well of peroxidase-conjugated neutravidin (Pierce, 1:1000 dilution). For chimeric antibodies, detection was using a goat anti-human Fc antibody (Cappel/ICN, 1:4000 dilution). Solid-phase LAP Binding Assay—A 96-well microtiter plate was coated with either 0.3 μg/ml of LAP or 2.5 μg/ml of LAP-Fc fusion protein diluted in PBS (50 μl/well, 4 °C, overnight). The coating solution was removed, and plates were blocked with 180 μl/well of 3% BSA/TBS at 25 °C for 1 h. In a separate 96-well round-bottom plate, 60 μl/well of a 2× stock (0.5 μg/ml (1.25 nm) of αvβ6 which had been labeled with NHS-biotin, 2 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2 in buffer A) was combined with 60 μl/well of a 2× stock of either hybridoma supernatant (for screening) or purified antibody (also in buffer A) and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. After washing the LAP-coated plate with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS in an automated plate washer, 100 μl of the antibody-αvβ6 mixture was transferred to the LAP-coated plate and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. The plate was washed as above and incubated with 50 μl/well of a 1:1000 dilution of extravidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) in buffer A for 1 h at 25 °C. Bound protein was detected using the substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. Cell Adhesion Assay Using LAP—A 96-well microtiter plate was coated with 50 μl/well of 0.5 μg/ml LAP diluted in 50 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.2, at 4 °C overnight. The plate was washed twice with PBS (100 μl/well), blocked with 1% BSA in PBS (100 μl/well) for 1 h at 25 °C, and washed twice with 100 μl/well of assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2). FDC-P1β6 cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were detached from culture flasks with 5 mm EDTA, incubated with 2 μm fluorescent dye (Calcein-AM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in assay buffer with gentle shaking in a 37 °C water bath for 15 min, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in assay buffer to 5 × 106 cells/ml. To individual wells of the washed plate were added 25 μl of supernatant (or purified antibody) and 25 μl of FDC-P1β6 cells labeled with Calcein-AM, and the plate was incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. The plate was washed 4-6 times with assay buffer (100 μl/well), and the fluorescence due to captured cells on the plate was recorded. Percent binding was determined by comparing the fluorescence prior to the final wash step (i.e. total cells added) to that after washing (i.e. bound cells). For adhesion assays using fibronectin, plates were coated with 50 μl/well of 5 μg/ml recombinant human fibronectin (Chemicon) diluted in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 9.0, at room temperature for 1 h, and washes were done using PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (350 μl/well), and blocking was with 200 μl/well assay buffer (0.1% BSA in PBS + 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) + 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. HT-29 cells labeled with Calcein-AM as above were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h, and the bound fluorescence was determined as described above. TGF-β Bioassay (Mink Lung Epithelial Cell PAI-1 Luciferase Coculture Assay)—TMLC (mink lung epithelial cell line Mv 1 Lu) transfected with PAI-1-luciferase construct (as described in Ref. 25Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) were grown in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum with 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml G418. SW480β6 cells were grown in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum with l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml G418. Cells were lifted from flasks with PBS + 5 mm EDTA, washed in PBS + 0.5% BSA, counted by hemocytometer, and plated in 96-well plates. SW480β6 cells were stored on ice for 2 h, whereas TMLC were plated in 96-well plates at 104 cells/well in DMEM + 0.1% FBS and allowed to adhere at 37 °C, after which bound TMLC were washed once with DMEM + 0.1% BSA. Monoclonal antibodies were diluted in DMEM + 0.1% BSA added to SW480β6 cells and pre-incubated for 20 min at room temperature. SW480β6 were then added to the TMLC at 4 × 104/well in DMEM + 0.1% BSA (100 μl/well). Plates were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in a humidified, CO2-enriched incubator. Supernatant was discarded and replaced with 100 μl of PBS + 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+. Cells were lysed, and luciferase was detected with a LucLite kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a micro-plate luminometer. Kinetic Exclusion Assay—Unactivated PMMA beads (200 mg, Sapi-dyne Instruments, Boise, ID) were coated with 100 μg/ml hsαvβ6 in PBS by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C and blocked by incubating for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 mg/ml BSA in PBS. Serial dilutions of hsαvβ6 were incubated with 1 × 10-10m (0.015 μg/ml) antibody (6.3G9 or 6.8G6) in a buffer consisting of either PBS (for 6.3G9) or PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2 (for 6.8G6). After 3 h at 25 °C, the concentration of free antibody in solution was determined by measuring the binding to hsαvβ6 beads, using a kinetic exclusion assay instrument (Sapidyne) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was used for detection of bead-bound antibodies. Platelet Aggregation Assay—50 ml of whole human blood was collected into 10-ml vacutainer tubes containing 1 ml of 3.8% sodium citrate. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifuging the citrate-treated blood for 5 min at 200 × g. The PRP was removed and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was prepared by centrifuging the remaining blood specimen at 1500 × g for 15 min. The platelet count in the PRP was adjusted to 2 × 108 platelets/ml using PPP. The Biodata 4-channel platelet aggregation profiler (PAP-4; Biodata Corp., Hatboro, PA) was blanked using a cuvette containing only PPP. 350 μl of PRP plus 100 μl of antibody were added to a cuvette containing a stir bar. To start aggregation, 50 μl of ADP at 2 × 10-4m was added to each stirring sample. A buffer control (24 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, containing 2 mm glucose, 0.1% BSA, and 1 mm MnCl2, pH 7.4) was run with each set of test samples. A 4-min aggregation tracing was generated for each sample, and % aggregation was calculated. The peptide RGD was run on each day as a positive control and effectively inhibited platelet aggregation. Determination of Antibody CDR Sequences—To determine the variable region sequences of the described antibodies, messenger RNA from the hybridoma cell lines was prepared on RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNAs for antibody heavy and light chain genes were prepared using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) and primers 5′-ATTAAGTCGACCKYGGTSYTGCTGGCYGGGTG-3′ for the heavy chain and 5′-GCGTCTAGAACTGGATGGTGGGAGATGGA-3′ for the light chain. The cDNAs were amplified in a PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the 5′ oligonucleotides listed above and the degenerate 3′ oligonucleotide pools 5′-GGGGATATCCACCATGGRATGSAGCTGKGTMATSCTCTT-3′, 5′-GGGGATATCCACCATGRACTTCGGGYTGAGCTKGGTTTT-3′, 5′-GGGGATATCCACCATGGCTGTCTTGGGGCTGCTCTTCT-3′, for the heavy chain and 5′-GGGGATATCCACCATGGATTTTCAGGTGCAGATTTTCAG-3′, 5′-GGGGATATCCACCATGRAGTCACAKACYCAGGTCTTYRTA-3′, 5′-GGGGATATCCACCATGAAGTTGCCTGTTAGGCTGTTG-3′, and 5′-GGGGATATCCACCATGAGGKCCCCWGCTCAGYTYCTKGGR-3′ for the light chain. The resultant amplified antibody variable region genes were cloned into the pCR4Blunt-Topo vector (Invitrogen), and sequence analysis was performed on multiple isolates to genera"
https://openalex.org/W2052208902,"The human pathogen Campylobacter jejuni is a highly motile organism that carries a flagellum on each pole. The flagellar motility is regarded as an important trait in C. jejuni colonization of the intestinal tract, however, the knowledge of the regulation of this important colonization factor is rudimentary. We demonstrate by phosphorylation assays that the sensor FlgS and the response regulator FlgR form a two-component system that is on the top of the Campylobacter flagellum hierarchy. Phosphorylated FlgR is needed to activate RpoN-dependent genes of which the products form the hook-basal body filament complex. By real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR we identified that FlgS, FlgR, RpoN, and FliA belong to the early flagellar genes and are regulated by σ70. FliD and the putative anti-σ-factor FlgM are regulated by a σ54- and σ28-dependent promoters. Activation of the fla regulon is growth phase-dependent, a 100-fold rpoN mRNA reduction is seen in the early stationary phase compared with the early logarithmic phase. Whereas flaB transcription decreases, flaA transcription increases in early stationary phase. Our data show that the C. jejuni flagellar hierarchy largely differs from that of other bacteria. Phenotypical analysis revealed that unflagellated C. jejuni mutants grow three times faster in broth medium compared with wild-type bacteria. In vivo the C. jejuni flagella are needed to pass the gastrointestinal tract of chickens, but not to colonize the ceaca of the chicken.

Two-component systems are assumed to be one of the prime bacterial systems of environmental adaptation and gene regulation, and likely play a major role in bacterial virulence. In general, they consist of two proteins, an integral membrane protein, the sensor kinase, and a cytoplasmic protein, the response regulator (1Parkinson J.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 857-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). These proteins communicate by reversible phosphorylation in response to changing environmental conditions (2Perraud A.L. Weiss V. Gross R. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 115-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The interaction of a distinct environmental stimulus with the sensor, usually in the periplasmic region, leads to activation of the kinase activity located in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the sensor (3Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 25-51Google Scholar). As a result a conserved cytoplasmic histidine residue of the sensor becomes phosphorylated. The phosphate is transferred to a conserved aspartate residue on the N-terminal domain of the cognate response regulator (3Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 25-51Google Scholar). The response regulator has affinity to distinct DNA sequences on the genome and, depending on its phosphorylation state, activates or represses gene transcription. This ultimately leads to a bacterial phenotype that is optimally adapted to its ecological niche. A key bacterial trait for chemotaxis, behavior, and survival is the flagellum. The more than 50 proteins that are involved in the assembly and function of the flagellum are expressed in a hierarchical order. In enteric bacteria the flagellar biosynthesis genes are divided into three classes (4Chilcott G.S. Hughes K.T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 694-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The early genes, flhC and flhD, transcribed by σ70, are the regulatory proteins that control the expression of the entire fla regulon and directly activate the so-called middle genes. These σ70 transcribed middle genes encode structural components of the basal-body hook structure, the type III secretion system, as well as the alternative σ-factor FliA (σ28) and the anti-σ-factor FlgM. FliA is kept inactive by the anti-σ-factor FlgM until FlgM is secreted through the completed basal-body hook structure. Once FliA is set free it activates the late genes that encode the filament, motor force generators, and the chemosensory machinery. The fla regulon in Caulobacter crescentus is activated by the response regulator, CtrA, family of the OmpR response regulators (5Wu J. Newton A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). CtrA activates σ54, which together with the response regulator FlhD, is responsible for activation of the middle and late fla genes. In Helicobacter pylori, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio species, the fla regulon is activated by homologues of the NtrC group of response regulators (i.e. FlgR, FleQ, and FlrA, respectively) that are part of a two-component signal transduction system that works in concert with the alternative σ factor RpoN (σ54) (6Prouty M.G. Correa N.E. Klose K.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1595-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 7Jyot J. Dasgupta N. Ramphal R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5251-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Spohn G. Scarlato V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these species, RpoN together with the response regulator activates the middle genes; late fla genes are regulated by σ28 in a σ54-dependent manner. Campylobacter jejuni is the leading bacterial cause of foodborne gastroenteritis in developed countries. Although C. jejuni can be found in most warm blooded animals its most favored habitat appears to be the intestine of avian species in which up to 109 colony forming units per gram of feces can be found (9Newell D.G. Fearnley C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 4343-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Ingestion of as few as 100 Campylobacters is sufficient to colonize the avian gut and it is reported that in broiler houses a total flock is colonized within a few days from initial exposure (10Young C.R. Ziprin R.L. Hume M.E. Stanker L.H. Avian Dis. 1999; 43: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Shreeve J.E. Toszeghy M. Pattison M. Newell D.G. Avian Dis. 2000; 44: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the intestine, C. jejuni is thought to penetrate the mucus that covers the epithelium of the small intestine and caeca. Important for this colonization event is the characteristic rapid darting corkscrew-like motility conferred by the polar flagellum and the spiral shape of C. jejuni. This feature enables C. jejuni to remain motile in mucus, the highly viscous environment that rapidly paralyzes other motile rod-shape bacteria (12Ferrero R.L. Lee A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 53-59PubMed Google Scholar, 13Shigematsu M. Umeda A. Fujimoto S. Amako K. J. Med. Microbiol. 1998; 47: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on the genome sequence of C. jejuni strain 11168, more than 50 genes are predicted to be involved in the assembly of the flagella (14Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Mungall K. Ketley J.M. Churcher C. Basham D. Chillingworth T. Davies R.M. Feltwell T. Holroyd S. Jagels K. Karlyshev A.V. Moule S. Pallen M.J. Penn C.W. Quail M.A. Rajandream M.A. Rutherford K.M. van Vliet A.H. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). These genes are located in more than 32 individual loci, whereas in Escherichia coli they are located in only six loci (15Guerry P. Alm R.A. Szymanski C.M. Trust T.J. Nachamkin I. Blaser M. Campylobacter. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000: 405-421Google Scholar) making the regulation of the Campylobacter fla regulon even more complex. Although the phenotypes of many flagellar mutants are known, the knowledge of the regulation of the fla regulon in C. jejuni is still rudimentary (16Golden N.J. Acheson D.W. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1761-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Hendrixson D.R. Akerley B.J. DiRita V.J. Mol.

So far RpoN, FliA, and FlgR have been identified as C. jejuni flagellar transcription activators (18Hendrixson D.R. DiRita V.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 687-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Jagannathan A. Constantinidou C. Penn C.W. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2937-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). How these proteins are regulated and what is their role in the assembly of the C. jejuni flagellum remains to be elucidated. In this paper, we report that FlgS and FlgR form a two-component signal transduction system and that this system is on the top of the Campylobacter flagellum hierarchy. In addition, we elucidated the regulation of the major fla regulon regulators and hypothesize that the assembly of the Campylobacter flagella is an energy consuming process that is necessary in vivo for passing through gastrointestinal tract of animals but not for colonizing the ceaca of chickens.

Motility was scored by measuring the diameter of the colonies. Growth Curve of Flagella Mutants—Overnight cultures of Campylobacter in heart infusion (HI) broth were diluted to A550 of 0.01 in 20 ml of HI and incubated at 37 °C, at 150 rpm, under microaerobic conditions in an anoxomat system (22Brazier J.S. Smith S.A. J. Clin. Pathol. 1989; 42: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Samples of 1 ml were taken via tubes inserted into the jar via airtight holes without loss of the microaerobic conditions inside the jar. The number of colony forming units was estimated by plating serial dilutions onto charcoal cefaperazone desoxychelate agar (Oxoid) plates. Construction of FlgR, FlgS, and FlgSt Overexpression Plasmids—To overexpress the FlgR response regulator protein, the chromosomal flgR gene was amplified using the primers 1024HN-NdeI and 1024C-BamHI. The resulting PCR fragment of 1336 bp was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into NdeI and BamHI sites of pT7.7 to form pT7-1024-H6N. The histidine kinase domain of the sensor FlgS was amplified from the chromosomal flgS gene with primers 793H-NdeI and 793-BamHIR. The resulting 645-bp PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pT7.7 to form pT7-793t-H6N. To produce the full-length FlgS the chromosomal flgS gene was amplified with primers 793H-NdeI2 and 793-BamHIR. The resulting 1056-bp product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned in pT7.7 to form pT7-793c-H6N. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned PCR products was verified by sequencing of both strands. Chromosomal DNA of C. jejuni 81116 was used as PCR template. Purification of FlgR, FlgS, and FlgSt Proteins—Histidine-tagged FlgR, FlgS, and FlgSt proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) containing plasmids pT7-1024-H6N, pT7-793c-H6N, or pT7-793t-H6N. Bacteria were grown in 400 ml of LB broth at 30 °C to an A550 of 0.5. Subsequently, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubation was continued for 4 h. Cells were harvested and suspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethane-sulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm imidazol, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme). After incubation for 30 min on ice, the bacteria were further disrupted by sonication. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation and 2 ml of 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) was added to the supernatant and incubated for1hat4 °C on an orbital shaker. The solution was packed to a column and washed with 20 ml of buffer W (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 20 mm imidazol). His-tagged proteins were eluted with 3 ml of buffer W containing 250 mm imidazol. The eluted fractions were dialyzed (16 h, 4 °C) against 3 liters of buffer B containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol, followed by dialysis (8 h) against 1 liter of buffer B containing 50% glycerol. Phosphorylation of FlgR by FlgS or FlgSt—The FlgS-H6, FlgSt-H6, or FlgR proteins were incubated at room temperature for 15, 15, or 20 min, respectively, with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Phosphorylation of FlgR-H6 was accomplished by adding 6 pmol of autophosphorylated FlgS-H6 or 1.5 pmol of FlgSt-H6 to 0.02 pmol of FlgR in phosphorylation buffer. The reaction was stopped after 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 min with SDS loading buffer. Samples were run on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis the gel was dried and autoradiographed. Detection of Flagellin Proteins by Western Blotting—Protein samples were prepared of overnight grown Campylobacter cultures and were run on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blotting was performed as described (23Nuijten P.J. van der Zeijst B.A. Newell D.G. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using polyclonal antisera raised against the major outer membrane protein of C. jejuni 81116 (24Nuijten P.J. Bleumink-Pluym N.M. Gaastra W. van der Zeijst B.A. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1084-1088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or monoclonal antibodies CF1 specific for flagellin A or CF17 (recognizing both Campylobacter 81116 flagellins A and B) (23Nuijten P.J. van der Zeijst B.A. Newell D.G. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Real-time RT-PCR—Overnight cultures of Campylobacter were diluted to A550 of 0.01 in 10 ml of HI and incubated at 37 °C, at 150 rpm, under microaerobic conditions. Total RNA was extracted from mid-exponential phase cultures (A550, 0.4–0.6) unless indicated otherwise, with the RNA-Bee™ kit (Tel-Test, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's specifications. RNA samples were diluted to exactly 1 μg/μl and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen). Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) was used to design primers to amplify 50–80-bp fragments. RT-PCR was performed on 0.2 μg of DNase I-treated RNA with 1 μm of primers using an ABI Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems) and the Sybr Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Real-time cycler conditions were 30 min at 50 °C, followed by 15 min at 95 °C and then for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Specificity was confirmed by electrophoretic analysis of the reaction products and by inclusion of template- or reverse transcriptase-free controls. Chicken Experiments—Challenge experiments were performed with Ross 308 broiler chickens housed in isolators as described (25Boer P. Wagenaar J.A. Achterberg R.P. Putten J.P. Schouls L.M. Duim B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). At day 7 after hatching, the animals were inoculated with 105 CFU of wild-type Campylobacter, flgR::Cm or BG3 (ΔflaAflaB)::Km mutant. At days 2, 4, 7, and 14 after inoculation, five animals from each group were sacrificed, and C. jejuni was reisolated from caecal contents. The caecal contents were serially diluted and plated onto charcoal cefaperazone desoxycholate agar plates. Isolated C. jejuni colonies were verified by the motility assay and presence of the chloramphenicol cassette. FlgS and FlgR Constitute a Two-component Signal Transduction System—Inspection of the C. jejuni genome revealed two putative genes, Cj0793 and Cj1024, that showed similarity with H. pylori sensor protein FlgS (Hp244) and the response regulator FlgR (Hp703), respectively. To address if the C. jejuni FlgS and FlgR proteins form a two-component system, both proteins and a truncated from of FlgS carrying the putative histidine kinase domain only, were expressed in E. coli and purified with help of attached His tags. Phosphorylation assays with the purified proteins showed that both FlgS and its truncated form were efficiently autophosphorylated in the presence of ATP (Fig. 1, A and B). The phosphorylated FlgS subsequently transferred the phosphate to the purified FlgR protein. The phosphorylation of the FlgR response regulator by the truncated FlgS sensor proteins was a very rapid but transient event (Fig. 1B). The amount of phosphorylated FlgR was much more stable when the phosphorylated intact FlgS was used as phosphate donor (Fig. 1A). Dephosphatase activity was therefore much stronger when truncated instead of the complete FlgS protein was used. As expected, the FlgR protein alone could not phosphorylate itself in the presence of ATP (Fig. 1, A and B). Construction and Phenotype Analysis of C. jejuni flgS, flgR, rpoN, and fliA Mutants—To study the flagellar hierarchy in C. jejuni, the genes encoding FlgS, FlgR, and the σ-factor FliA (Cj0061) were inactivated by allelic exchange with defective copies carrying chloramphenicol cassettes (data not shown). Phenotype analysis of these mutants and a previous constructed rpoN mutant (26Wösten M.M. Steenbakkers P.J. Koot T.G. van der Zeijst B.A. Wösten M.M. Initiation of Transcription and Gene Organization in Campylobacter jejuni. Ponsen & Looijen B. V. Wageningen, Utrecht, The Netherlands1997: 63-77Google Scholar) demonstrated that they all were non-motile in a soft agar motility assay (Fig. 2). Electron microscopy revealed that flgS, flgR, and rpoN mutants are unflagelled, whereas the fliA mutant contained truncated flagella (data not shown). When grown in liquid media, the mutants grew much faster than the wild-type with measured doubling times of 23, 24, and 22 min for the flgS, flgR, and rpoN mutants and 60 min for the parent strain, respectively (Fig. 3). The fliA mutant showed an intermediate doubling time of 43 min. Measurement of dry bacterial weights showed that the amount of final biomass produced was 14% higher in the flgR mutant compared with the wild-type. On solid HI media the mutants showed a reduced growth compared with the parent strain (data not shown). Microscopic analyses revealed that the mutants were similarly sized as the parent strain and showed a non-aggregation phenotype in contrast to the wild-type strain. The fliA mutant again showed an intermediate phenotype consistent with the truncated flagella produced by this phenotype (19Jagannathan A. Constantinidou C. Penn C.W. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2937-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Growth curves of the indicated Campylobacter strains in HI at 37 °C under microaerobic conditions, determined by measuring the A550 and CFU/ml.WT, wild-type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RpoN or FliA Activate the Structural Components of the Campylobacter flagellum—As a first step in studying the regulation of flagella biogenesis, we scanned the C. jejuni genome sequence to identify σ54- and σ28-dependent genes. C. jejuni possesses only three σ factors: σ70, σ54, and σ28 (14Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Mungall K. Ketley J.M. Churcher C. Basham D. Chillingworth T. Davies R.M. Feltwell T. Holroyd S. Jagels K.

Nature. 2000; 403: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). So far σ54- and σ28-dependent promoters only have been identified in front of flagellar genes flgDE, flaB, and flaA, respectively (18Hendrixson D.R. DiRita V.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 687-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Nuijten P.J. van Asten F.J. Gaastra W. van der Zeijst B.A. J. Biol.

In contrast to the Campylobacter σ70 promoter consensus sequence, the σ54 and σ28 promoter consensus sequences resemble those of eubacteria (TGGCAC-N5-TTGCW) and (TAAA-N15-GCCGATAA), respectively (29Wösten M.M. Boeve M. Koot M.G. van Nuene A.C. van der Zeijst B.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 594-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wösten M.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of the genome revealed putative σ54 or σ28 promoters in front of all structural flagellar genes. From this analysis, more stringent σ54 and σ28 promoter consensus sequences for Campylobacter could be deduced (Fig. 4). Regulation of the FlgS/FlgR Regulon—To investigate the potential role of the FlgS/FlgR two-component system and the different (anti-)σ factors in the regulation of the fla regulon, transcription in the various mutants strains of a large series of flagella and non-nonflagella genes was determined by real-time RT-PCR. To be able to compare the levels of transcription, equivalent amounts of mRNA isolated from mid-exponential grown Campylobacter cultures were used. The transcription of the following genes was determined: rpoD, gyrA, flgS, flgR, rpoN, fliA, CJ1463, flgM, flaA, flaB, and fliD. The constitutively expressed housekeeping genes rpoD (σ70) and gyrA were used as controls (31Savli H. Karadenizli A. Kolayli F. Gundes S. Ozbek U. Vahaboglu H. J. Med. Microbiol. 2003; 52: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Whereas the gyrA expression was the same in all Campylobacter cultures, rpoD expression was less in the flgR and rpoN mutants. The flgS, flgR, and rpoN genes were found to be transcribed from σ70 promoters (Fig. 5A). With the use of different set of primers, the flgS promoter was located within 60 bp of the flgS transcriptional start site (data not shown). Mutation of flgS, flgR,or rpoN has minor effects on the transcription of the rpoN gene. A potential conserved σ54 promoter (GGCTCTTTGCTTGCT) seemed present at 77 bp in front of the start codon of the rpoN gene, meaning that the rpoN gene may be to some extent autoregulated (Fig. 5B). Transcription of the flaB and Cj1463 genes, both containing a σ54 promoter (Fig. 4), was strongly reduced in the flgS, flgR, and rpoN mutants. This indicates that FlgR must be phosphorylated by FlgS to activate the transcription of these genes together with the σ-factor 54 (Fig. 5A). The fliA gene is also transcribed by a σ70 promoter (Fig. 5C). Whereas a fliA mutation did not affect the transcription of the flgS, flgR, rpoN, flaB, or Cj1463 gene,"

The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are intrinsic inhibitors of apoptosis by virtue of inhibiting distinct caspases and are, therefore, critical regulators of cell death.

Endoplasmic reticulum emerged recently as an intracellular organelle involved in the control of apoptosis. Endoplasmic reticulum is the site of protein folding and posttranslational modifications. As such, the ER is sensitive to perturbations in homeostasis triggered by different stimuli that results in the induction of a stress response known as unfolded protein response (UPR) 1The abbreviations used are: UPR, unfolded protein response; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis; uORF, upstream open reading frame; UTR, untranslated region; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; ANOVA, analysis of variance; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; z-VAD-FMK, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; IRES, internal ribosome entry sites; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor. (1Ron D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The UPR is characterized by reduction of global protein synthesis and specific up-regulation of stress-response genes such as ATF4 or BiP. The role of UPR is to protect cell from the ER stress. Indeed, the failure to alleviate the stress leads to the activation of apoptotic pathway(s) and cell death. Recent evidence suggests that there exists an ER-specific apoptotic pathway in which caspase-12 is activated in response to ER stress (2Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-12 leads to the activation of downstream caspases-9 and -3, forming a caspase cascade analogous to the mitochondria-induced pathway (3Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, which caspase functions as an initiator caspase during the ER stress conditions in human cells since the functional caspase-12 is lost in humans (4Fischer H. Koenig U. Eckhart L. Tschachler E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins emerged a key regulators of apoptosis by virtue of their ability to directly bind and inhibit distinct caspases (5Holcik M. Gibson H. Korneluk R.G. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Among the eight members of this family the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, XIAP, is the most potent inhibitor of both the initiator and effector caspases, although other members of the IAP family are thought to play important roles in a subset of apoptotic conditions (6Holcik M. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 7Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). HIAP2 (GenBank™ XM040717; also known as c-IAP1, MIHB, BIRC2) is a multifunctional protein that was initially identified through the interaction with the tumor necrosis factor-receptor complex proteins TRAF1 and TRAF2 (8Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). In addition to suppressing apoptosis induced by various triggers by directly binding to and inhibiting caspases-3 and -7 (9Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 10Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar), HIAP2 interacts with TRAFs and regulates the signaling through the tumor necrosis factor receptor (8Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). HIAP2 also exerts a pro-apoptotic activity; the C-terminal RING finger of HIAP2 possess a ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and sensitizes cells to apoptosis by directing ubiquitylation and removal of TRAF2 after the activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor (11Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the expression of HIAP2 is controlled at the level of translation (12Warnakulasuriyarachchi D. Ungureanu N.H. Holcik M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). There exists a short regulatory upstream open reading frame (uORF) that is located in the 5′-UTR of HIAP2 and exerts an inhibitory effect on the translation of HIAP2. Here, we have investigated the expression of HIAP2 during ER stress. We demonstrate that HIAP2 is translationally up-regulated in response to ER stress induced by thapsigargin or tunicamycin. Surprisingly, the mechanism of this induction is independent of the regulatory uORF, and instead, it utilizes an inducible IRES element. The activity of the HIAP2 IRES is low in un-stressed cells but is enhanced after induction of ER stress by a caspase cleavage fragment of p97/DAP5/NAT1. Induction of HIAP2 attenuates apoptotic response after ER stress since antisense-mediated down-regulation of HIAP2 enhanced sensitivity of HeLa cells to tunicamycin. Plasmids—Plasmids used in this study have been previously described as follows: pβgal/CAT, pβgal/XIAP/CAT, and pCAT (13Holcik M. Lefebvre C.A. Yeh C. Chow T. Korneluk R.G. Nat.

Ikeda J.E. MacKenzie A. Korneluk R.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Bi-cistronic vectors containing various fragments of the HIAP2 5′-UTR were constructing by inserting the β-galactosidase gene in front of the HIAP2 5′-UTR fragments in monocistronic constructs that were described previously (12Warnakulasuriyarachchi D. Ungureanu N.H. Holcik M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The plasmid hp-pβgal/CAT was constructed by inserting the synthetic hairpin (ccg gcc ggc cgg ccg gcc ggc caa agg ccg gcc ggc cgg ccg gcc ggc tag cgg tac) in front of the β-galactosidase reporter gene in plasmid pβgal/CAT. In all plasmids the expression is directed from a cytomegalovirus promoter. All constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection Reagents—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) and human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells were cultured in standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and antibiotics as described previously (16Holcik M. Yeh C. Korneluk R.G. Chow T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4174-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Transient DNA transfections were conducted using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) with the protocol provided by the manufacturer and 1 μg of plasmid DNA per 6-well plate well. When mono-cistronic plasmids were used, 0.5 μgofpβgal reporter plasmid was included in each transfection to normalize for transfection efficiency. Co-transfection experiments were done as described above except that 1 μg of bi-cistronic plasmid was combined with 1 μg of indicated expression plasmid. For the endoplasmic stress experiments cells were first transfected with the indicated plasmids. 24 h after transfection the cells were treated with thapsigargin (5 μm), tunicamycin (8.5 μm), z-VAD-FMK (100 μm) or Me2SO for 24 h and then collected for analysis as described below. Cell Viability Assay—HeLa cells were transiently transfected in 6-well plates with either pcDNA-HIAP2 or pβgal plasmids as described above. For antisense experiments cells were infected with adenoviral vector encoding either LacZ or antisense HIAP2 cDNAs described previously (17Li J. Feng Q. Kim J.M. Schneiderman D. Liston P. Li M. Vanderhyden B. Faught W. Fung M.F. Senterman M. Korneluk R.G. Tsang B.K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) at a multiplicity of infection of 5. 24 h post-transfection/infection the cells were treated with tunicamycin (8.5 μm) or Me2SO for 24 h, and cell viability was determined by WST-1 (Roche Applied Science) for each treatment. All data are shown as an average ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Western blots were performed on parallel samples to determine the levels of HIAP2 expression. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA/0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was assayed by the protein assay kit (Bradford assay; Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting for expression of HIAP2, XIAP, BiP, actin, eIF4G, PARP, processed caspase 3, and FLAG-p97 using rabbit polyclonal anti-XIAP (Ægera), anti-eIF4G (18Bushell M.

Antibody complexes were detected using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). β-Galactosidase and CAT Analysis—Transiently transfected cells were harvested 24 h after transfection in the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science), and cell extracts were prepared using the protocol provided by the manufacturer. β-Galactosidase enzymatic activity in cell extracts was determined by the spectrophotometric assay using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (19MacGregor G.R. Nolan G.P. Fiering S. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Murray E.J. Walker J.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. Vol. 7. Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1991: 217-235Google Scholar), and the CAT levels were determined using the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The relative CAT activity and IRES activity were determined as a ratio of CAT/β-galactosidase. All data are shown as an average ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Coupled in vitro transcription and translations (TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System, Promega) were performed under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Each reaction was programmed with 1 μg of purified plasmid DNA of the indicated plasmids. In vitro translated proteins were labeled with l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min and analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The intensities of the CAT band were determined on a Bio-Rad Model GS-670 imaging densitometer. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—Total RNA was isolated from untransfected or transiently transfected cells with the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with 1 unit of DNase I. The 32P-labeled anti-sense RNA probes spanning 149 nucleotides of the HIAP2 5′-UTR (coordinates 1073–1222) or human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Pharmingen) were synthesized using the MaxiScript T7 transcription kit (Ambion) and gel-purified. Ribonuclease protection assay analysis was performed using the RPA III kit (Ambion) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was hybridized overnight at 42 °C with 5 × 104 cpm of high specific activity probe and then digested with RNase A/RNase T1 mix. The digested samples were ethanol-precipitated and separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The protected fragments were visualized by detection to x-ray film and quantified on a Bio-Rad Model GS-670 imaging densitometer. UV Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—The cellular extracts (S10) were prepared from p97- or p86-transfected 293 T cells as previously described (20Huez I. Creancier L. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Prats A.C. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6178-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). RNA-protein complexes for UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation were prepared as described (21Holcik M. Gordon B.W. Korneluk R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The samples were irradiated in a 96-well dish on ice with a 254-nm UV light source at 400,000 μJ/cm2. UV-irradiated RNA-protein complexes were treated with RNase T1 (1 unit/μl) for 10 min at room temperature, and heparin, SDS, and β-mercaptoethanol were added to final concentrations of 5 mg/ml and 1 and 1%, respectively. The samples were boiled for 5 min and then diluted in the binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The nonspecific protein binding was removed by incubating samples with 20 μl of protein A + G-agarose (Calbiochem) for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were then incubated with protein A + G-agarose precoated with 4 μg of monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and washed 5 times in 600 μlofthe binding buffer. The immunoprecipitated RNA-protein complexes were released from the agarose beads by boiling in SDS-loading buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2.5% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.025% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Induction of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Up-regulates HIAP2—We observed that the levels of IAP protein HIAP2 were increased in HEK293T (Fig. 1A) or HeLa cells (data not shown) treated with thapsigargin (an inhibitor of ER calcium pump) or tunicamycin (an inhibitor of protein glycosylation). The induction of HIAP2 paralleled the expression pattern of a known ER stress-inducible gene, BiP. In contrast, the levels of another member of the IAP family, XIAP, remained unchanged, suggesting that not all members of the IAP family are induced by ER stress. When we examined the RNA samples from treated and untreated cells we noted that the levels of HIAP2 mRNA did not change in response to drug treatments (Fig. 1B). Thus, the induction of HIAP2 protein after the ER stress could be due to translational up-regulation of HIAP2 protein. We have shown previously that the 5′-UTR of HIAP2 is refractory to translation because it contains a regulatory upstream open reading frame (12Warnakulasuriyarachchi D. Ungureanu N.H. Holcik M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We, therefore, wanted to determine if the HIAP2 5′-UTR or its uORF is involved in the regulation of HIAP2 expression in response to ER stress. Monocistronic CAT reporter plasmids in which the 5′-UTR of HIAP2 (with or without the mutation in the uORF-initiating CUG) is fused with the CAT gene (Fig. 1C) were transiently co-transfected with plasmid pβgal into HEK293T cells, and the cells were treated with thapsigargin or tunicamycin. We observed that the translation of CAT from the 5′-UTR-containing construct, but not in the absence of the 5′-UTR, was enhanced in drug-treated cells (Fig. 1D). This observation paralleled the behavior of the endogenous HIAP2 in drug-treated cells, suggesting that the induction of HIAP2 after ER stress is due to the translation up-regulation that is mediated by the 5′-UTR. Surprisingly, the CUG → CUA mutation that prevents the translation of uORF (12Warnakulasuriyarachchi D. Ungureanu N.H. Holcik M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) had no effect on the induction of CAT after ER stress. Therefore, although the 5′-UTR mediates induction of HIAP2 in response to ER stress, this induction is independent of the regulatory uORF. Triggering of the ER stress results in the repression of global protein synthesis. Indeed, both thapsigargin and tunicamycin inhibited the translation of β-galactosidase reporter gene by ∼30% (Fig. 1E). In contrast, the translation of the CAT reporter remained unchanged (Fig. 1E). This resistance to the ER-induced inhibition of translation was mediated by the HIAP2 5′-UTR since in the construct lacking the 5′-UTR the translation of CAT was inhibited to the same extent as that of β-galactosidase (Fig. 1E). This suggests that the 5′-UTR of HIAP2 allows translation of HIAP2 in response to ER stress by a mechanism that escapes inhibition of global protein synthesis. HIAP2 Is Translated by an Inducible IRES Element after ER Stress—An alternative mechanism of translation initiation that is often resistant to the changes in global proteins synthesis has been described for several cellular genes and is mediated by IRES elements (for review, see Ref. 22Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The data described thus far were consistent with the notion that ER-induced HIAP2 translational up-regulation could be mediated by internal initiation. However, when we tested the IRES activity of HIAP2 5′-UTR previously we failed to observe any IRES activity (12Warnakulasuriyarachchi D. Ungureanu N.H. Holcik M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We, therefore, hypothesized that the induction of ER stress may be necessary for the activation of the HIAP2 IRES element. Indeed, when HEK293T or HeLa cells transfected with the bi-cistronic construct β-gal/HIAP2(1073–1222)/CAT were treated with thapsigargin or tunicamycin, we observed the induction of CAT translation similar to that observed with the monocistronic constructs (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Interestingly, the insertion of the full-length1.2-kilobase HIAP2 5′-UTR (plasmid β-galactosidase/HIAP2(1–1222)/CAT) resulted in higher IRES activity. This activation of translation was not due to an alternative splicing since no differences in the integrity or the amount of the bi-cistronic mRNA were observed in treated and untreated cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, reversing the orientation of the HIAP2 5′-UTR or the deletion of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the bi-cistronic plasmid prevented induction of CAT expression in thapsigargin-treated cells (data not shown). To confirm that HIAP2 5′-UTR harbors an IRES element we inserted a stable hairpin in front of the β-galactosidase reporter gene that inhibits its translation by preventing ribosomal scanning. After the induction of ER stress by thapsigargin we observed that translation of CAT remained unchanged, although the levels of β-galactosidase remained almost undetectable (Fig. 2C). The translation of CAT was due solely to the presence of the 5′-UTR since we could not detect any CAT levels in the construct lacking the 5′-UTR. In addition, when the rabbit reticulocyte lysates were programmed with the hair-pin-containing bi-cistronic construct we detected a single CAT protein band of the expected size (26 kDa) in the construct containing the 5′-UTR but not with the control construct lacking the 5′-UTR (Fig. 2D). These data are consistent with the existence of an IRES element in the 5′-UTR of HIAP2. Translational Activation of HIAP2 IRES Is Dependent on Active Caspases—Prolonged ER stress leads to the activation of programmed cell death pathways and apoptosis. It was suggested that, at least in rodent cells, caspase-12, which translocates to the outer membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum after ER stress, functions as the initiator caspase in response to stress stimuli and initiates the subsequent activation of other caspases (2Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 3Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). In human cells the role of caspase-12 is likely replaced by an as yet unidentified caspase since the functional caspase-12 is lost (4Fischer H. Koenig U. Eckhart L. Tschachler E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We, therefore, wished to test whether the activation of caspases is necessary for the induction of HIAP2 IRES. The activity of HIAP2 IRES reporter construct pβgal/HIAP2(1–1222)/CAT was tested in cells treated with thapsigargin or tunicamycin and in which caspase activation was blocked by treatment with pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 3A). Indeed, we observed that in both thapsigargin- and tunicamycin-treated cells the pretreatment of cells with z-VAD-FMK inhibited induction of HIAP2 IRES. This suggested that caspase activation is necessary for the activation of HIAP2 IRES. Several laboratories have demonstrated that activation of caspases will result in the cleavage of several translation initiation factors (eIFs), resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis (23Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Jeffrey I.W. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Among the eIFs, the caspase-mediated degradation of members of the eIF4G family (specifically eIF4GI and p97/DAP5/NAT1) was implicated in the regulation of cell survival during apoptosis (14Nevins T.A. Harder Z.M. Korneluk R.G. Holcik M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3572-3579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 23Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Jeffrey I.W. Pain V.M.

Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 469-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the levels of eIF4GI and p97/DAP5/NAT1 during ER stress (Fig. 3B). In both thapsigargin and tunicamycin-treated cells we observed the disappearance of the full-length eIF4GI protein that was accompanied by the appearance of the 76-kDa M-FAG (middle fragment of apoptotic cleavage of eIF4G) fragment, which is characteristic of caspase-mediated degradation of eIF4GI during apoptosis (18Bushell M. Poncet D. Marissen W.E. Flotow H. Lloyd R.E. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because the available antibody to p97/DAP5/NAT1 does not recognize the cleavage fragment of p97/DAP5/NAT1 (data not shown), we transfected HEK293T cells with FLAG-tagged p97/DAP5/NAT1-expressing vector and examined the processing of p97/DAP5/NAT1 using the anti-FLAG antibody. Similarly to eIF4GI, the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress by both drugs resulted in the cleavage of p97/DAP5/NAT1 and appearance of the 86-kDa caspase-mediated fragment (p86) characterized previously (26Henis-Korenblit S. Strumpf N.L. Goldstaub D. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The proteolytic processing of eIF4GI and p97/DAP5/NAT1 paralleled the processing of PARP protein, a bona fide caspase substrate and was accompanied by the induction of BiP, which is indicative of ER stress (Fig. 3B). Activation of HIAP2 IRES and Induction of HIAP2 Protein Are Mediated by the p86 Fragment of p97/DAP5/NAT1—We and others have suggested previously that the caspase-mediated p86 fragment of p97/DAP5/NAT1 could function as a stress-specific mediator of IRES translation (14Nevins T.A. Harder Z.M. Korneluk R.G. Holcik M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3572-3579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24Henis-Korenblit S. Shani G. Sines T. Marash L. Shohat G.

Biol. 2000; 20: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We, therefore, wished to test whether the p86 fragment of p97/DAP5/NAT1, which is produced during ER stress, is directly responsible for the activation of HIAP2 IRES. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with HIAP2 IRES reporter construct pβgal/HIAP2(1–1222)/CAT and either FLAG-p97- or FLAG-p86-expressing vectors. Activation of HIAP2, but not of XIAP IRES, was observed in p86 but not in p97 co-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). Importantly, Western blot analysis of the protein lysates from transfected cells confirmed that overexpression of p86 but not p97 resulted in increased levels of HIAP2, but not XIAP, endogenous protein as well (Fig. 4B). In addition, overexpression of p86 fragment did not result in the activation of a construct with HIAP2 5′-UTR in the reverse orientation or a construct without an insert (data not shown). The activation of the HIAP2 IRES was also observed in the hairpin-containing reporter construct (Fig. 4C). In addition, the increase in IRES activity was due to the specific increase in the translation of CAT and not a decrease in the translation of β-galactosidase (Fig. 4C). To further demonstrate the induction of HIAP2 IRES by p86 we utilized the in vitro transcription/translation system. Rabbit reticulocyte lysates were primed with the hairpin-containing HIAP2 IRES reporter construct and either the FLAG-p97- or FLAG-p86-expressing plasmids. The addition of p86 fragment resulted in the activation of HIAP2 IRES (Fig. 4D, compare the second and third lanes). This activation was specifically mediated by the HIAP2 5′-UTR sequence since we did not observe any CAT protein product with the bi-cistronic construct that lacks the 5′-UTR insert (Fig. 4D, first lane). These data suggest that the caspase-mediated cleavage fragment of p97/DAP5/NAT1, p86, selectively enhances translation of HIAP2 IRES element both in vivo and in vitro in a manner that is independent of the translation of the upstream cistron. Activation of HIAP2 IRES by p86 Correlates with the Activation of HIAP2 IRES by ER Stress—To further explore the link between HIAP2 IRES activity and p86 we sought to determine the region(s) within the HIAP2 5′-UTR that mediates HIAP2 IRES induction by p86. These mapping experiments were performed in HEK293T cells that were co-transfected with the FLAG-p86-expressing plasmid. Deletion analysis of the HIAP2 5′-UTR identified two regions of interest. The first, spanning the 5′ proximal 990 nucleotides of HIAP2 5′-UTR, appears to have a somewhat inhibitory function on IRES translation since the deletion of this region resulted in the 1.5–2-fold enhancement of the HIAP2 IRES activity (Fig. 5A). This suggests that there may exist additional protein factors that coregulate HIAP2 IRES activity. The second region is located between the nucleotides 1073 and 1142. The deletion of this sequence completely abolished HIAP2 IRES activity both in transfected cells (Fig. 5A) and in reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 5B), suggesting that this region is essential for IRES activity and the p86-mediated induction of HIAP2 IRES. More importantly, this sequence is also necessary for the induction of HIAP2 IRES activity by ER stress since the construct lacking the 1073–1142 sequence failed to exhibit IRES activity in thapsigargin-treated cells (Fig. 5C). Similarly, deletion of the 990–1222 region abolished IRES activity in thapsigargin-treated cells (Fig. 5C). Together, these results suggest that the sequence between the coordinates 1073 and 1142 is essential for the ER stress-induced HIAP2 IRES and that this induction is mediated by the caspase-mediated p86 cleavage fragment of p97/DAP5/NAT1. Our attempts to cross-link and immunoprecipitate the HIAP2 IRES RNA with either the p97 or p86 proteins failed, presumably because p97/p86 is not a direct RNA-binding protein (data not shown). If this is the case, then the activation of HIAP2 IRES brought about by p86 is mediated by another IRES binding protein. The efforts to identify the full ensemble of HIAP2 IRES-binding proteins are ongoing. Induction of HIAP2 Occurs at Initial Stages of ER Stress— Because the cleavage of p97 and subsequent induction of HIAP2 could be a result of nonspecific caspase processing at the final stages of ER-stress-induced cell death, we wished to examine the time course of p97 processing, caspase activation, and induction of HIAP2. We observed that processing of p97 correlated with the induction of HIAP2 and occurred 6 h after treatment of cells with tunicamycin and preceded the induction of BiP (Fig. 6). Interestingly, however, although we observed the cleavage of PARP at an earlier time point (3 h), the processing of caspase-3, the terminal executioner caspase, occurred only 12 h post-tunicamycin treatment. These data suggest that the processing of p97 and the induction of HIAP2 both occur at the early phase of ER stress response and are not a consequence of general degradation of translation machinery in the final stages of apoptosis. Changes in HIAP2 Levels Modulate ER Stress-induced Cell Death—We have shown that HIAP2 is increased after ER stress. We, therefore, wished to explore the physiological significance of this observation. Because prolonged ER stress leads to cell death and since HIAP2 is a potent inhibitor of cell death, we reasoned that increased expression of HIAP2 should prevent or delay ER stress-induced cell death. To test this hypothesis HeLa cells were transfected with either HIAP2- or β-galactosidase-expressing vectors, and cell viability was determined 24 h after treatment with tunicamycin. We observed that overexpression of HIAP2, but not β-galactosidase, attenuated tunicamycin-induced cell death (Fig. 7). Conversely, down-regulation of HIAP2 by antisense targeting enhanced cell sensitivity to tunicamycin. Taken together, these data indicate that HIAP2 levels are important in mediating the cellular response to ER stress. IRES elements are RNA regulatory motifs that have been originally discovered in the RNAs of picornaviruses. The RNA of these viruses is naturally uncapped and utilizes the IRES to recruit ribosomes directly to the vicinity of the initiation codon and facilitate translation (27Jackson R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 127-183Google Scholar). Recently, cellular IRES elements emerged as important regulators of translation of selected cellular mRNAs, particularly in conditions of cellular stress (22Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 25Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Korneluk R.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 469-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In contrast to the translation of a typical cellular mRNA that is capped, IRES translation does not require the presence of the m7G cap-binding protein eIF4E. Because the majority of the translational control is executed through the modulation of the initiation step of translation, IRES translation escapes many of the control mechanisms that govern cap-dependent translation (22Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Indeed, of less than 50 cellular IRES elements identified to date, almost half are found in genes encoding oncogenes, growth factors, and proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis, arguing that IRES-dependent translation is an important regulatory mechanism for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (22Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 25Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Korneluk R.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 469-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). It is becoming evident that IRES elements are controlled by different regulatory mechanisms. For instance, the IRES-mediated translation of the inhibitor of caspases XIAP is increased in response to serum starvation and low dose γ irradiation (13Holcik M. Lefebvre C.A. Yeh C. Chow T. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 16Holcik M. Yeh C. Korneluk R.G. Chow T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4174-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) but not in etoposide (14Nevins T.A. Harder Z.M. Korneluk R.G. Holcik M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3572-3579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or ER stress-inducing drug-treated cells (Fig. 1A). IRES elements of some genes, such as cat-1, platelet-derived growth factor, c-myc, or vascular endothelial growth factor are activated by conditions that increase phosphorylation of eIF2α such as amino acid starvation, cell differentiation, or ER stress (28Fernandez J. Yaman I. Sarnow P. Snider M.D. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19198-19205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 29Gerlitz G. Jagus R. Elroy-Stein O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2810-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We demonstrated here that the translation of inhibitor of apoptosis protein HIAP2 is enhanced in response to ER stress and is mediated by an inducible IRES element. Interestingly, inhibition of phosphorylation of eIF2α had no effect on the activation of HIAP2 in thapsigargin- or tunicamycin-treated cells (data now shown), suggesting that HIAP2 IRES is refractory to the translational control mediated by eIF2α. In contrast, HIAP2 IRES is activated in a caspase-dependent manner by a proteolytic cleavage fragment of p97/DAP5/NAT, p86. Interestingly, other apoptotic triggers such as serum starvation, hypoxia, etoposide, or tumor necrosis factor α did not induce levels of endogenous HIAP2 protein nor did they enhance translation of HIAP2 IRES-driven reporter construct (Ref. 12Warnakulasuriyarachchi D. Ungureanu N.H. Holcik M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar and data not shown). These data suggest that in addition to caspase activation, an additional ER stress-specific event is required for the induction of HIAP2. Alternatively, the cleavage of p97 has to occur by ER-specific caspase to activate HIAP2 IRES. These possibilities are currently under investigation in our laboratory. Unfolded protein response evolved as a cellular-protecting mechanism. Both the reduction of global protein synthesis and the transcriptional induction of chaperones, the two arms of UPR, serve to relieve the cellular stress. Translation of HIAP2 is up-regulated during ER stress induced by thapsigargin or tunicamycin. In this respect HIAP2 could be considered a stress response gene, like ATF4 or BiP, which are classic UPR targets. Similarly to HIAP2, translation of BiP is also mediated by an IRES element (30Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In contrast to HIAP2, however, the IRES of BiP is not activated after ER stress (28Fernandez J. Yaman I. Sarnow P. Snider M.D. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19198-19205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), suggesting that although both BiP and HIAP2 are translated by IRES, they are regulated by distinct molecular mechanisms, likely reflecting their diverse roles in UPR. Of note, induction of HIAP2 after ER stress precedes induction of BiP. The increased levels of BiP in UPR are thought to facilitate correct protein folding and maintain ER function (31Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). Although it was suggested that BiP could form a complex with caspases-7 and -12 and, thus, prevent their activation (32Rao R.V. Peel A. Logvinova A. del Rio G. Hermel E. Yokota T. Goldsmith P.C. Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), caspase inhibition is not a primary function of BiP. In contrast, HIAP2 is a bona fide caspase inhibitor that blocks apoptosis induced by a variety of triggers (9Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 10Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of HIAP2 during ER stress could, therefore, serve to delay the progression of caspase cascade, attenuating apoptosis and allowing the execution of UPR. Indeed, we found that overexpression of HIAP2 attenuated tunicamycin-induced cell death, and conversely, antisense-mediated down-regulation of HIAP2 enhanced cell sensitivity to tunicamycin. The requirement of caspase activation for the up-regulation of HIAP2 may seem paradoxical since the activation of caspases indicates final stages of cellular death. However, the initial activation of caspases triggered by ER stress could be subsequently blocked by increased levels of HIAP2 and delay further caspase processing. Indeed, we observed that the processing of p97 and induction of HIAP2 occurred 6 h post-tunicamycin treatment, whereas caspase-3 cleavage occurred later, indicating that both events take place at an early phase of ER stress response. A similar situation was reported for granzyme B-induced apoptosis, where caspase-3, which is directly activated by granzyme-B, is subsequently kept inactive by another member of the IAP family, XIAP (33Goping I.S. Barry M. Liston P. Sawchuk T. Constantinescu G. Michalak K.M. Shostak I. Roberts D.L. Hunter A.M. Korneluk R. Bleackley R.C. Immunity. 2003; 18: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that XIAP is also translated by an IRES mechanism. Importantly, however, the levels of XIAP are not increased in response to ER stress. Furthermore, XIAP IRES is not activated by the p86 fragment of p97/DAP5/NAT1, indicating that the regulation of cellular antiapoptotic response to different triggers is executed by distinct molecular mechanisms.

We hypothesize that interleukin-18, a proinflammatory cytokine, induces endothelial cell apoptosis. Human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMEC) were treated with interleukin (IL) 18. mRNA expression was analyzed by ribonuclease protection assay, protein levels by immunoblotting, and cell death by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. We also investigated the signal transduction pathways involved in IL-18-mediated cell death. Treatment of HCMEC with IL-18 increases 1) NF-κB DNA binding activity; 2) induces κB-driven luciferase activity; 3) induces IL-1β and TNF-α expression via NF-κB activation; 4) inhibits antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL; 5) up-regulates proapoptotic Fas, Fas-L, and Bcl-XS expression; 6) induces fas and Fas-L promoter activities via NF-κB activation; 7) activates caspases-8, -3, -9, and BID; 8) induces cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm; 9) inhibits FLIP; and 10) induces HCME cell death by apoptosis as seen by increased annexin V staining and increased levels of mono- and oligonucleosomal fragmented DNA.

Furthermore, caspase-8, IKK-α, and NF-κB p65 knockdown or dominant negative IκB-α and dominant negative IκB-β or kinase dead IKK-β significantly attenuated IL-18-induced HCME cell death. Effects of IL-18 on cell death are direct and are not mediated by intermediaries such as IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, or interferon-γ.

Under physiological conditions, apoptosis or programmed cell death plays a vital role in endothelial and smooth muscle cell homeostasis. However, apoptosis of endothelial cells plays a pathological role during ischemia, ischemia/reperfusion injury, infarction, atherogenesis, and atherosclerosis. Interactions between endothelial cells and immune cells during immune and inflammatory disorders and generation of abnormally high levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates have also been shown to induce endothelial cell injury (1Irani K.

Both IL-1β and IL-18 are synthesized as proforms, and are cleaved by IL-1β converting enzyme (caspase-1) to a mature, biologically active, and secreted form (8Gu Y. Kuida K. Tsutsui H. Ku G. Hsiao K.

IL-18 is induced during various immune, infectious, and inflammatory disorders, and further amplifies the inflammatory cascade by inducing the expression of other proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules (6Gracie J.A.

It induces the expression of several ELR+ CXC chemokines, and attracts and activates polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the site of injury or inflammation (6Gracie J.A. Robertson S.E. McInnes I.B. J.

Recently, IL-18 has also been shown to be a potent chemoattractant for CD4+ T cells both in vivo and in vitro (11Matsumoto S. Tsuji-Takayama K. Aizawa Y. Koide K. Takeuchi M. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), implicating its proinflammatory role in immune and autoimmune disorders. IL-18 signals via the IL-18 receptor. IL-18R comprises α and β subunits (12Born T.L. Thomassen E. Bird T.A. Sims J.E. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 5041-5044PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas IL-18Rα acts as a ligand binding subunit, the β subunit transduces intracellular signals. Binding of IL-18 to its receptors results in the recruitment of MyD88, an adaptor molecule also involved in IL-1 and Toll-like receptor signaling, followed by IRAK and TRAF6 (14Adachi O. Kawai T.

Activation of NF-κB results in the induction of several inflammatory mediators including IL-18 and IL-18-mediated NF-κB-dependent gene transcription (6Gracie J.A. Robertson S.E. McInnes I.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 7Dinarello C.A. J. Allergy Clin.

For example, in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts, Morel et al. (10Morel J.C.M. Park C.C. Kumar P. Koch A.E. Lab. Investig. 2001; 81: 1371-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that IL-18 activates NF-κB and NF-κB-dependent IL-8, epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78, and groα induction. Furthermore, IL-18 induced VCAM-1 expression on endothelial cells and rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and NF-κB activation, and increased endothelial-monocyte adhesion (19Morel J.C.M.

In addition to its stimulatory effects on cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, IL-18, in combination with IL-2, has been shown to induce tumor cell death via the Fas-Fas-L pathway (20Wigginton J.M. Lee J.K. Wiltrout T.A. Alvord W.G. Hixon J.A. Subleski J. Back T.C. Wiltrout R.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4467-4474Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and in combination with IL-12, induced natural killer T cell lymphocyte cell death (21Leite-de-Moraes M.C. Herbelin A. Gouarin C. Koezuka Y. Schneider E. Dy M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4367-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, concurrent administration of IL-18 and IL-12 induced lacrimal and salivary gland atrophy with epithelial cell apoptosis (22Kimura-Shimmyo A. Kashiwamura S. Ueda H. Ikeda T. Kanno S. Akira S. Nakanishi K. Mimura O. Okamura H. J. Immunother. 2002; 25: S42-S51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, IL-18, by itself, has not been shown to induce cell death. In addition, the signal transduction pathways elicited by IL-18 in endothelial cell death have yet to be explored. In the present study, we demonstrate that IL-18 activates NF-κB, induces IL-1β and TNF-α expression, up-regulates the proapoptotic Fas, Fas-L, and Bcl-XS expression, down-regulates the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL gene expression, activates caspases-8, -3, and -9, inhibits the long isoform of FLIP, and induces HCMEC death independent of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. Cell Culture—Human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HC-MEC) were obtained from ScienCell Research Laboratories (San Diego, CA). They were characterized by the immunofluorescent method using antibodies directed against VWF/Factor VIII and CD31 (P-CAM) and by uptake of DiI-Ac-LDL. The cells were grown in endothelial cell medium supplied by the manufacturer and supplemented with 5% serum (complete media). At 70–80% confluency, the complete media was replaced with media containing 0.5% BSA. After overnight incubation, recombinant human (rh) IL-18 (R&D Systems) was added and cultured for the indicated time periods. At the end of the experimental period, culture supernatants were collected and snap frozen. Cells were harvested, snap frozen, and stored at -80 °C. To determine whether IL-18 induces NF-κB activation directly or is mediated by intermediaries such as IL-1β, TNF-α, or IFN-γ, cells were pretreated with the respective neutralizing antibodies (goat-anti-human IL-1β (AB-201-NA), TNF-α (AF-210-NA), IFN-γ (AF-285-NA) antibodies; R&D Systems; 5 μg/ml for 1 h) prior to IL-18 addition. Normal goat IgG (AB-108-C; R&D Systems) served as control. Efficacy of these antibodies was verified in transfection assays using HCMEC transiently transfected with pNF-κB-Luc vector that contains five copies of the NF-κB consensus sequence linked to the minimal E1B promoter-luciferase reporter gene (23Chandrasekar B. Melby P.C. Sarau H.M. Raveendran M. Perla R.P. Marelli-Berg F.M. Dulin N.O. Singh I.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 4675-4686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, cells were treated for 1 h with anti-IL-1β, -TNF-α, or -IFN-γ antibodies (5 μg/ml) followed by the addition of the respective recombinant protein (rhIL-1β, 100 pg/ml; rhTNF-α, 100 pg/ml; rhIFN-γ, 10 ng/ml) for an additional 7 h. pRL Renilla-luciferase reporter gene (100 ng; pRL-TK vector, Promega) was used as an internal control. Cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase activities were determined with a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) using the Promega Biotech™ dual luciferase reporter assay system (23Chandrasekar B. Melby P.C. Sarau H.M. Raveendran M. Perla R.P. Marelli-Berg F.M. Dulin N.O. Singh I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4675-4686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Data were normalized for transfection efficiency by dividing firefly luciferase activity with that of corresponding Renilla luciferase, and expressed as mean relative stimulation ± S.E. for a representative experiment from three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate. After transfection cells were found viable as seen by trypan blue dye exclusion. Cells were also treated with phosphorothioated TNF-α antisense (5′-CAGTGCTCATGGTGTC-3′) or scrambled (5′-CGATGTCTCTGGGTTC-3′) oligonucleotides (24Hu R.H. Chu S.H. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 2000; 22: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) using OligofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) prior to IL-18 treatment. Efficacy of TNF-α antisense oligonucleotides was verified in lipopolysaccharide-treated (1 μg/ml for 24 h; Escherichia coli 055:B5, Sigma) HCMEC. To determine the signal transduction pathways involved in IL-18-mediated NF-κB and κB-dependent cytokine induction, cells were transiently transfected with dnIRAK in pCI-Neo (25Jensen L.E.

Double stranded scrambled siRNA were used as a control (scrambled siRNA; 5′-CUCGGCGUUUCAUCUGUGGdTdT). Knockdown of respective proteins were confirmed after 72 h post-transfection by Western blotting. NF-κB inhibition was also achieved by transfecting cells with IKK-α siRNA expression vector (IMGENEX Corp., San Diego, CA), or transiently transfected with dnIKK-γ (pcDNA3-IKK-γ-HA), dnIκB-α (pCMX-IκB-α (S32A/S36A)), or dnIκB-β (pCMV-Tag3B-IκB-β (S19A/S32A)-Myc) using LipofectAMINE™ reagent (23Chandrasekar B. Melby P.C. Sarau H.M. Raveendran M. Perla R.P. Marelli-Berg F.M. Dulin N.O. Singh I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4675-4686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Empty vectors were used as controls. Inhibition of caspases-1 and -8 was achieved by transfecting HCMEC with caspase-1 and caspase-8 siRNA expression vectors (IMGENEX), or pretreating (30 min) the cells with Z-IETD-FMK (a caspase-8 inhibitor: 50 μm in Me2SO). In addition, cells were pretreated with Z-DEVD-FMK (a caspase-3 inhibitor; 50 μm), Z-LEHD-FMK (a caspase-9 inhibitor; 20 μm), Z-VAD-FMK (a pan-caspase inhibitor; 50 μm), or Z-FA-FMK (a negative control; 50 μm) in Me2SO or Me2SO alone. Caspase inhibitors were obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—NF-κB DNA binding activities were measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Preparation of nuclear protein extracts and EMSA were performed as described earlier (24Hu R.H. Chu S.H. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 2000; 22: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA): NF-κB, consensus, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′, mutant, 5′-AGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′. In addition κB-binding sites from Fas (sense; 5′-TGACCACCGGGGCTTTTCGTGAGCTCGTCT-3′; between -260 and -230 nt; the core consensus sequence is underlined (28Chan H. Bartos D.P. Owen-Schaub L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2098-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and Fas-L (proximal: sense; 5′-AGACAGAGGTGTTTCCCTTAGCTATGGA-3′; between -62 and -34 nt; distal: sense; 5′-GCCTCCATGGTCTCTCCCCTCAGAGCCATT-3′; nucleotides between -543 and -514 (29Li-Weber M. Laur O. Dern K. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)) were also used. In the absence of protein extract, competition with 100-fold molar excess unlabeled or corresponding mutant oligonucleotides served as controls. Gel supershift assays were performed as previously described (23Chandrasekar B. Melby P.C. Sarau H.M. Raveendran M. Perla R.P. Marelli-Berg F.M. Dulin N.O. Singh I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4675-4686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) using anti-p50 (C-19; sc-1190 X) and anti-p65 (C-20; sc-372 X) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). fas and Fas-L Promoter Analyses—HCMEC were transfected with the human fas promoter-reporter constructs containing nucleotides from -1739 to -19 in either sense or antisense (-19/-1739) orientations (28Chan H. Bartos D.P. Owen-Schaub L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2098-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Owen-Schaub and colleagues (28Chan H. Bartos D.P. Owen-Schaub L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2098-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated that fas promoter is orientation-dependent and when present in an antisense orientation it is inactive both at basal and stimulated conditions. Therefore, the antisense (-19/-1739) construct served as an additional control. In addition, the fas nucleotide sequence -306 to -19 that contains a κB-like motif was also analyzed (28Chan H. Bartos D.P. Owen-Schaub L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2098-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Fas-L (CD95L) promoter-reporter construct (-860/+100) in pTATA-Luc was transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE™ reagent as described previously (29Li-Weber M. Laur O. Dern K. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Corresponding empty vectors also served as controls. Cells were cotransfected with the dnIκB-α expression vector. In addition, the IL-18-mediated increase in κB-dependent luciferase activity was analyzed using luciferase reporter vector (pLuc-MCS) containing three copies of the NF-κB site from the fas promoter (described under EMSA; pLuc-Fas-3X-κB) cloned into the multiple cloning site of pLuc-MCS vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (28Chan H. Bartos D.P. Owen-Schaub L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2098-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pLuc-MCS was used as a vector control. Similarly, 4 copies of the distal κB site (pLuc-4X-530) or 3 copies of the proximal κB site (pLuc-3X-50) from the Fas-L promoter were cloned into the multiple cloning site of the reporter plasmid pTATA-Luc and analyzed (29Li-Weber M. Laur O. Dern K. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). pTATA-Luc was used as a vector control. To confirm our EMSA results, we have also analyzed κB-driven luciferase activity using the pNF-κB-Luc vector using Lipofect-AMINE™ reagent. pEGFP-Luc served as a control. The pRL Renilla-luciferase reporter gene (100 ng; pRL-TK vector, Promega) was used as an internal control. Luciferase activities were determined as previously described (23Chandrasekar B. Melby P.C.

Transfection efficiency of HCMEC was determined as previously described using pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) that constitutively expresses EGFP under regulation of the cytomegalovirus promoter and enhancer (23Chandrasekar B. Melby P.C. Sarau H.M. Raveendran M. Perla R.P. Marelli-Berg F.M. Dulin N.O. Singh I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4675-4686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The transfection efficiency was 34.6 ± 2.21% (mean ± S.E., n = 22). Overexpression of Bcl-XL or Inhibition of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL with Bcl-2/Bcl-XL Bispecific Antisense Oligonucleotides—To investigate whether overexpression of Bcl-XL will prevent IL-18-induced cell death, HCMEC were transfected with the Bcl-2 (pcDNA3-Bcl-2-Flag) expression vector (a gift from Gabriel Nunez, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI) using LipofectAMINE™ reagent. To investigate whether inhibition of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL potentiates IL-18-induced cell death, cells were transfected with Bcl-2/Bcl-XL bispecific antisense oligonucleotides or control scrambled oligonucleotides (gifts from Dr. Uwe Zangemeister-Wittke; 30) using OligofectAMINE. Both Bcl-2/Bcl-XL bispecific antisense oligonucleotide (4625; 5′-AsAsGsGsCsAsTsCsCsCsAsGsCsCsTsCsCsGsTsT-3′) and scrambled oligonucleotide (4626; 5′-CsAsCsGsTsCsAsCsGsCsGsCsGsCsAsCsTsAsTsT-3′) were 20-mers with a phosphorothioate backbone and five nucleotides at the 5′ and 3′ ends modified by MOE residues at the 2′-position of the deoxyribose (underlined letters in the sequences above (30Zangemeister-Wittke U.

Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 2547-2555PubMed Google Scholar)). mRNA Analysis—Expression of IL-18Rα and IL-18Rβ was analyzed by Northern blot analysis using 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA. Total RNA was extracted from HCMEC with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and enriched for poly(A)+ RNA with the PolyATtract® mRNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, MI). IL-18Rα and IL-18Rβ cDNA were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using total RNA isolated from HCMEC using the following gene-specific primers: IL-18Rα (AcPL; 418 nt, Gen-Bank™ accession number NM_003855.2), sense, nt 528–549; antisense, nt 925–946; and IL-18Rβ (290 nt, GenBank™ accession number NM_003853.2), sense, nt 1517–1537; antisense, nt 1787–1807. Proinflammatory and proapoptotic gene expressions were analyzed by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) as previously described (31Prabhu S.D. Wang G. Luo J. Gu Y. Ping P. Chandrasekar B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 83-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RPA was carried out according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (RiboQuant RPA kit, BD Biosciences) using 20 μg of total RNA per sample. The template antisense 32P-labeled cRNA probes were specific for apoptosis and proinflammatory cytokines (BD Biosciences), and included hbcl-2 (unprotected 189 nt, protected 160 nt), hFas (345, 316), hFas-L (381, 353), hBcl-XL (393, 364), hBcl-XS (393, 324), hBad (282, 253), hBax (210, 181), hIL-1β (257, 230), and hTNF-α (314, 286). L32, a large ribosomal RNA (141, 113), was used as an internal control. High specific activity antisense RNA probes were derived by T7 RNA polymerase using [32P]UTP and an in vitro transcription kit (RiboQuant in vitro transcription kit, BD Pharmingen), and yielded 4.2 × 105 Cherenkov counts/ml. A standard curve was generated using the migration distance of the undigested probes as markers versus log nucleotide length. Sizes of the RNase-protected fragments were derived using the standard curve. Protein Analysis—Isolation of whole cell homogenates, electrophoresis, electroblotting, and Western blot analysis by the ECL chemiluminescence detection system were carried out essentially as described (23Chandrasekar B.

Here we describe the first thermodynamic and mechanistic studies of metal binding to a cation diffusion facilitator. Isothermal titration calorimetric analyses of the purified YiiP and binding competitions among Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ revealed a mutually competitive binding site common to three metal ions and a set of noncompetitive binding sites, including one Cd2+ site, one Hg2+ site, and at least one Zn2+ site, to which the binding of Zn2+ exhibited partial inhibitions of both Cd2+ and Hg2+ bindings. Lowering the pH from 7.0 to 5.5 inhibited binding of Zn2+ and Cd2+ to the common site. Further, the enthalpy change of the Cd2+ binding to the common site was found to be related linearly to the ionization enthalpy of the pH buffer with a slope corresponding to the release of 1.23 H+ for each Cd2+ binding. These H+ effects are consistent with a coupled deprotonation process upon binding of Zn2+ and Cd2+. Modification of histidine residues by diethyl pyrocarbonate specifically inhibited Zn2+ binding to the common binding site, indicating that the mechanism of binding-deprotonation coupling involves a histidine residue(s). Sequence homology of the Escherichia coli YiiP places it within the family of cation diffusion facilitators, a family of membrane transporters that play a central role in regulating cellular zinc homeostasis.

Isothermal titration calorimetric analyses of the purified YiiP and binding competitions among Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ revealed a mutually competitive binding site common to three metal ions and a set of noncompetitive binding sites, including one Cd2+ site, one Hg2+ site, and at least one Zn2+ site, to which the binding of Zn2+ exhibited partial inhibitions of both Cd2+ and Hg2+ bindings. Lowering the pH from 7.0 to 5.5 inhibited binding of Zn2+ and Cd2+ to the common site. Further, the enthalpy change of the Cd2+ binding to the common site was found to be related linearly to the ionization enthalpy of the pH buffer with a slope corresponding to the release of 1.23 H+ for each Cd2+ binding. These H+ effects are consistent with a coupled deprotonation process upon binding of Zn2+ and Cd2+. Modification of histidine residues by diethyl pyrocarbonate specifically inhibited Zn2+ binding to the common binding site, indicating that the mechanism of binding-deprotonation coupling involves a histidine residue(s). Zinc is required by many metalloproteins for catalytic activities, structural stability, and functional regulations (1Coleman J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 2Berg J. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar, 3Beyersmann D. Haase H. BioMetals. 2001; 14: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Low cellular zinc levels inhibit cell growth and division, whereas high zinc levels are toxic. To maintain cellular zinc content within a narrow physiological range, cells rely on a complement of zinc homeostatic mechanisms by the expression of zinc chelation proteins, sequestrations of zinc into intracellular membrane compartments, and controls of zinc entry and exit from cells through several families of zinc transporters (4Vasak M. Hasler D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 5Eide D. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 1532S-1535SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Blencowe D. Morby A.

Saier M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Seven mammalian CDF proteins, ZnT1–7 (zinc transporter 1–7), have been cloned and characterized. ZnT1 is involved in zinc efflux across the plasma membrane (11Palmiter R. Findley S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), and ZnT2–7 facilitate zinc accumulation in various intracellular compartments (12Palmiter R. Cole T. Findley S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 13Kirschke C. Huang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4096-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Bacterial CDF proteins are distantly related to mammalian counterparts by a homologous hydrophobic domain with six distinct hydrophobic segments (14Grass G. Fan B. Rosen B. Franke S. Nies D. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4664-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Guffanti A. Wei Y. Rood S. Krulwich T. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Despite large variability in the hydrophilic regions, all CDF family members identified so far, prokaryotic or eukaryotic, appear to transport metal ions exclusively (10Paulsen I. Saier M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The migration of a metal ion in a transporter involves temporary association of the metal ion with one or more binding sites along a translocation pathway. This combined process of equilibrium binding and energized movement brings about the metal selectivity of the transporter and the mobility of the metal substrate. Therefore, thermodynamic and kinetic studies of CDF proteins are critically important to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of metal ion transport across biological membranes. The kinetics of a homologous Escherichia coli CDF protein, ZitB, was studied by stopped-flow measurements of metal ion fluxes across the membrane of proteoliposomes reconstituted from the purified ZitB (16Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12043-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The ZitB-mediated transport was shown to be a substrate-saturable process that can be described by a two-step reaction of an equilibrium binding followed by a conformational transition that moves the bound metal ion across the membrane. Both Cd2+ and Zn2+ are effective substrates, the translocation of which requires a proton movement in the reverse direction of the metal transport. This coupling of metal ions to protons provides the energetic basis for zinc efflux in E. coli, where the downhill influx of proton produces free energy to drive efflux of the cytoplasmic zinc. To gain an energetic and mechanistic understanding of the metal ion binding to CDF proteins, we used isothermal titration calorimetric (ITC) to directly measure the heat exchanges that accompany metal binding to an E. coli CDF protein, YiiP. This calorimetric approach allows the dissecting of the Gibbs free energy of binding ΔG into two thermodynamic components: the enthalpy change, ΔH, and the entropy change, ΔS (17Leavitt S. Freire E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). ΔH is measured directly from ITC measurements; the binding constant Ka and stoichiometry are obtained by a least-squares fit of the binding isotherm to a binding model. ΔG is given by ΔG = –RTlnKa, and ΔS is calculated by using the standard thermodynamic expression ΔG = ΔH – TΔS. These thermodynamic parameters permit the evaluation of enthalpic and entropic contributions to the Gibbs free energy of binding, thereby providing a thermodynamic description of the binding reaction. Furthermore, the coupling between metal ions and protons can be evaluated by the dependence of the metal ion binding on pH and the dependence of the apparent binding enthalpy (ΔHapp) on the proton ionization enthalpy (ΔHion) of the buffer in which the binding reaction takes place (18Baker B. Murphy K. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2049-2055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In the latter case, ΔHapp is the sum of two enthalpic contributions, the metal ion binding enthalpy, ΔHbind, and the proton ionization enthalpy of the buffer, which gives rise to a cumulative relationship, ΔHapp = ΔHbind + nΔHion, where n is the number of protons that are absorbed or released upon metal binding (19Gomez J. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Here we describe the thermodynamic analyses of metal ion bindings to the purified YiiP. YiiP was over-expressed, solubilized by detergent, and purified free of metal contaminants prior to ITC experiments. Titrations of YiiP were carried out using three group-12 metal ions: Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+. Zn2+ is a borderline soft-hard metal ion with a highly concentrated charge and strong electron affinity, whereas Hg2+ is a soft metal ion with a bulky and highly polarizable charge. Cd2+, known as a substitute for Zn2+ in many zinc enzymes, has an intermediate softness (20Frausto da Silva J. Williams R. The Inorganic Chemistry of Life. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2001Google Scholar). Chemical differences in the Zn2+ → Cd2+ → Hg2+ series resulted in distinctive calorimetric responses, serving as thermodynamic signatures to aid the deconvolution of complex binding isotherms. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the molecular recognition that underlies metal ion binding to a metal transporter. Cloning and Expression Plasmid Construct—The entire open reading frame sequence of YiiP was obtained by PCR using the genomic DNA of E. coli BL21 strain as template and a pair of YiiP-specific primers with a NdeI and a BamHI site incorporated into the 5′-ends of the forward and reverse primer, respectively (forward primer 5′-GCAGCCATATGCTCGAGAATCAATC-3′, reverse primer 5′-GGATCCTTATGAAAGCATAGACCGT-3′). The PCR product was double digested using MfeI and BamHI (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA), yielding two fragments. The larger piece was isolated and further digested using NdeI. The resulting NdeI-MfeI and MfeI-BamHI fragments were inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites in expression vector pET15b (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) in frame with an N-terminal 6-histidine affinity tag followed by a thrombin proteolytic cleavage site. The completed expression construct pHis-TB-YiiP was verified by automatic sequencing of both strands. Over-expression of YiiP—Over-expression of YiiP was achieved using the overnight express autoinduction systems-1 (Novagen) based on an auto-inducing procedure 2F. W. Studier, personal communication. (22Grossman T. Kawasaki E. Punreddy S. Osburne M. Gene. 1998; 209: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) were transformed with pHis-TB-YiiP and stored in a noninducing medium at –80 °C. The frozen stock was inoculated into 50 ml of Luria-Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and the culture was grown to log phase at 37 °C, whereupon cells were harvested and then inoculated to a 6-liter auto-induction medium for unattended induction and expression of YiiP. The overnight auto-induced culture typically reached an optical density (A600) of 4–6 absorbance units. Purification—Cells were harvested and lysed by three passages through an ice-chilled microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton, MA) at 1000 p.s.i., and the resulting membrane vesicles were collected by centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 45 min. The pellet was solubilized using a detergent buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 7% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM; Anatrace, Maumee, OH), 0.25 mm TCEP, 20% w/v glycerol) with gentle stirring for 40 min at 4 °C to achieve a complete extraction of YiiP from membrane vesicles. Insoluble materials were pelleted by centrifugation (140,000 × g for 45 min), and the supernatant was passed through a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. After washing the column with 10 bed volumes of wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 20% w/v glycerol, 0.05% DDM, 0.25 mm TCEP, 30 mm imidazole), YiiP was eluted with an elevated imidazole concentration at 500 mm. The purified His-YiiP was loaded to a 10-kDa cutoff dialysis cassettes (Pierce) for simultaneous dialysis and protein concentration using an external dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 20% w/v glycerol, 0.05% DDM, 0.25 mm TCEP) with the addition of 3% polyethylene glycol 35,000. Thrombin (Novagen, Madison, WI) was added into the dialysis cassette at a ratio of 1 unit/mg of His-YiiP to cleave the N-terminal poly-His peptide. Preparation of Protein Sample for ITC Measurements—Protein aggregates and trace amount of metal contaminants were removed by size exclusion HPLC prior to calorimetric titrations with metal ions. Concentrated YiiP, typically at a concentration of 10 mg/ml, was incubated with 5 mm EDTA for about 20 min before being loaded to a TSK 3000SWXL column (TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA) pre-equilibrated with a degassed mobile phase (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 12.5% glycerol, 0.05% DDM, 0.25 mm TCEP). HPLC purification was performed using a System-Gold HPLC system run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). TCEP was omitted from the mobile phase when YiiP sample was prepared for Hg2+ titrations because the presence of this reducing reagent caused significant dilution heats of Hg2+. The HPLC-purified YiiP was detected by its UV absorption at 280 nm, collected as a discrete peak fraction, and then immediately used for ITC measurements. For titrations at low pH, YiiP was purified in an otherwise identical HPLC mobile phase except that 20 mm MES was used to buffer pH at 5.5. For titrations at pH 7.0 in the presence of a different pH buffer, YiiP was purified as described above, except that HEPES was replaced by an indicated buffer. The concentration of the purified YiiP was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC measurements were carried out on a MicroCal MCS titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA). Metal titrants (chloride salts of Zn2+, Cd2+, or Hg2+) were dissolved in the same HPLC mobile phase in which YiiP was purified, and their concentrations were adjusted to be 30–50-fold higher than that of YiiP, typically in the concentration range of 1 to 3 mm. The titrant and YiiP sample were thoroughly degassed before each titration. YiiP samples ranging in concentrations from 0.032 to 0.090 mm were placed in a 1.4-ml reaction cell, and the reference cell was filled with deionized water. All titrations were performed at 25 °C. After temperature equilibration, successive injections of an indicated titrant was made into the reaction cell in 5-μl increments at 210–360-s intervals with stirring at 300 rpm to ensure a complete equilibration. The resulting heats of reaction were measured over 30–50 consecutive injections. Control experiments to determine the heats of titrant dilution were carried out by making identical injections in the absence of YiiP. The net reaction heat was obtained by subtracting the heat of dilution from the corresponding total heat of reaction. The titration data were deconvoluted based on a binding model containing either one or two sets of noninteracting binding sites by a nonlinear least-squares algorithm using the MicroCal Origin software. The binding enthalpy change ΔH, association constant Ka, and the binding stoichiometry n were permitted to float during the least-squares minimization process and taken as the best-fit values. Reaction with DEPC—YiiP was mixed with 10 mm DEPC dissolved in the HPLC mobile phase with the addition of 2 mm Zn2+, Cd2+, or EDTA as indicated. After incubation with DEPC for an indicated time, the reactions were terminated by adding 20 mm imidazole to quench the unreacted DEPC. Next, 5 mm EDTA was added to chelate metal ions in the reaction mixture, resulting in metal-free and DEPC-modified YiiP that was further purified by size exclusion HPLC as described above. The protein peak fraction was collected and immediately loaded to the MicroCal MCS titration calorimeter for ITC measurements. Purification—The over-expressed His-YiiP was purified to homogeneity by a one-step nickel affinity chromatography (Fig. 1A). His tag and residual metal contaminants in the purified His-YiiP sample are two major factors that interfere with metal calorimetric titrations. Therefore, the His tag was cleaved by thrombin digestion, and the completeness of the proteolytic cleavage was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and by Western blot analysis using an antibody specific to poly-His peptide (data not shown). Residual labile metal ions in the YiiP sample were chelated by incubation with 5 mm EDTA for 20 min, but prolonged EDTA incubation caused irreversible YiiP aggregation. The cleaved His tag peptide, metal ion, and EDTA contaminants were removed from YiiP samples by preparative size exclusion HPLC purification. The quality of the resulting YiiP was assessed by analytical size exclusion HPLC, showing a major mono-disperse species with a retention time corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 190 kDa (Fig. 1B). Calorimetric Titrations of YiiP with Zn2+—The energetics of Zn2+ binding to YiiP was examined directly by ITC at 25 °C, pH 7.0, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Examples of heat changes accompanying the binding of incremental additions of Zn2+ to YiiP are shown in the upper panels of Fig. 2. Plots of the integrated heat per mole of Zn2+ as a function of the molar ratio of Zn2+ to YiiP are displayed in the lower panels. As shown in Fig. 2A, Zn2+ titrations began with an exothermic heat reaction, which was followed by a late endothermic reaction. This characteristic exothermic-to-endothermic transition suggests the presence of at least two sets of independent Zn2+ binding sites, accounting for the exothermic and endothermic heat reactions, respectively. Furthermore, the dual heat reactions were reduced to a largely endothermic reaction when YiiP was titrated with Zn2+ in the presence of either 0.5 mm CdCl2 (Fig. 2B) or 0.25 mm HgCl2 (Fig. 2C). This conspicuous loss of exothermic heat profile in the presence of Cd2+ or Hg2+ suggests that competitive binding occurs at the Zn2+ exothermic binding site (Zn2+ site 1) by Cd2+ or Hg2+. In contrast, binding to the Zn2+ endothermic binding site (Zn2+ site 2) was less affected by Cd2+ and Hg2+. Based on this qualitative assessment, Zn2+ binding isotherm was fitted to a binding model containing two sets of independent binding sites, with ΔH, Ka, and binding stoichiometry n values permitted to float. The fit to this binding model yielded 1.5 and 0.84 equivalents of Zn2+ bound to site 1 and site 2 with respective ka values of 0.33 ± 0.47 μm–1 and 6.3 ± 6.1 mm–1. The data were of insufficient quality to determine the Zn2+ binding parameters with certainty (Table I), in part because of an unresolved enthalpic transition that was evident at the beginning of Zn2+ titrations, where the exothermic heat effects increased progressively rather than staying at a steady level (Fig. 2A). This additional heat reaction might be associated with a high affinity binding site on the interface of the YiiP oligomeric complex, because the corresponding transition in the binding isotherm occurred at a stoichiometric equivalence point with a value far less than unity.Table ISummary of thermodynamic parameters for metal ion binding to YiiP at 25 °C at pH 7.0SiteTitrantCompeting metal ionKanΔHΔGTΔSμm-1kcal/molkcal/molkcal/molSite 1 (common site)ZnCl2None0.33 ± 0.471.5 ± 0.2-4.5 ± 0.3-7.5+3.0CdCl2Not observedHgCl2Not observedCdCl2None8.7 ± 0.451.2 ± 0.1-6.5 ± 0.1-9.4+3.0HgCl2Not observedZnCl2Not interpretableHgCl2None960 ± 4601.0 ± 0.1-22.5 ± 0.2-12.2-10.3CdCl2Not observedZnCl2Not interpretableSite 2ZnCl2None(6.3 ± 6.1) × 10-30.84 ± 2.312.5 ± 380-5.2+17.7CdCl2Not interpretableHgCl2Not interpretableCdCl2None0.30 ± 0.050.84 ± 0.05-6.1 ± 0.7-7.4+1.3HgCl20.50 ± 0.050.77 ± 0.03-7.6 ± 0.3-7.8+0.12ZnCl2Not interpretableHgCl2None1.8 ± 0.91.3 ± 0.1-4.1 ± 0.3-8.5+4.4CdCl22.7 ± 0.31.5 ± 0.1-16.3 ± 0.2-8.7-7.6ZnCl2Not interpretable Open table in a new tab Calorimetric Titrations of YiiP with Cd2+—In contrast to the mix of endothermic and exothermic heat reactions during Zn2+ titrations, the heat effects generated by the Cd2+ binding were purely exothermic with a transition occurring at a stoichiometric equivalence point of 2 (Fig. 3A). Thus, this binding isotherm suggests the involvement of two sites for Cd2+ binding. Cd2+ titrations in the presence of 0.25 mm Hg2+ also yielded a pure exothermic reaction but showed a midpoint of binding heat changes at 1 stoichiometric equivalent (Fig. 3B). This apparent loss of one equivalent Cd2+ binding site suggests that one of the two Cd2+ binding sites is blocked by Hg2+ binding, whereas the other is not affected. Therefore, a binding model for two sets of independent binding sites was used to fit the corresponding competitive and noncompetitive Cd2+ bindings. All parameters (n, Ka, and ΔH) were allowed to float during the least-squares minimization process, resulting in an excellent fit corresponding to Ka1 = 8.70 ± 0.45 μm–1, n1 = 1.2 ± 0.1, ΔH1 = –6.5 ± 0.1 kcal/mol; Ka2 = 0.30 ± 0.05, μm–1, n2 = 0.84 ± 0.05, ΔH2 = –6.1 ± 0.7 kcal/mol. The binding stoichiometries for both sites are close to unity, consistent with the qualitative assessment that there are two independent binding sites for Cd2+ binding. One tight (site 1) and one weaker (site 2) site can be mathematically distinguished by a 29-fold difference in their binding affinities. The Cd2+ binding isotherm obtained in the presence of 0.25 mm Hg2+ was fit to a one-site model, resulting in best-fit parameters (Ka = 0.50 ± 0.05 μm–1, n = 0.77 ± 0.03, and ΔH = –7.6 ± 0.3 kcal/mol) in agreement with those of site 2. A comparison between the binding parameters obtained from free YiiP and Hg2+-prebound YiiP suggests that site 1 is a common competitive binding site for both Cd2+ and Hg2+. Cd2+ titrations in the presence of 0.5 mm Zn2+ broadened the binding isotherm and caused a greatly reduced exothermic heat effect, indicative of a diminished Cd2+ binding to the Zn2+-prebound YiiP (Fig. 2C). The resulting featureless isotherm precluded fits of any binding model, but it was clear that Zn2+ binding obstructed Cd2+ binding to both site 1 and site 2. Calorimetric Titrations of YiiP with Hg2+—The binding of Hg2+ was shown to block an exothermic Zn2+ binding site (Zn2+ site 1) or a high affinity Cd2+ binding site (Cd2+ site 1). To further examine whether the binding of Zn2+ or Cd2+ could mutually block the Hg2+ binding, Hg2+ titrations were carried out to examine Hg2+ binding to free-YiiP and to YiiP pre-bound with Zn2+ or Cd2+. Similar to Cd2+ titrations at neutral pH, Hg2+ titrations showed a pure exothermic reaction with two distinct phases (Fig. 4A). In the first phase the exothermic heat effects dropped rapidly and then relaxed in the second phase to the dilution level, which was considerably higher than when titrated with Zn2+ or Cd2+. After correction for heats of Hg2+ dilution, an excellent fit to the Hg2+ binding isotherm was obtained for a model containing two sets of independent binding sites with all six fit parameter floating freely. The resulting Ka value for the tight binding site (Hg2+ site 1) differs by 550-fold from that of the weaker site (Hg2+ site 2) (Table I). Furthermore, the fit of the Hg2+ binding isotherm obtained from the Cd2+-prebound YiiP (Fig. 4B) showed only a single Hg2+ binding site with three best-fit parameters (Ka, n, and ΔH) in agreement with those of Hg2+ site 2 (Table I). This result suggests that Cd2+ binding blocks Hg2+ site 1 but has little effect on Hg2+ site 2. The Hg2+ binding isotherm obtained from Zn2+-prebound YiiP showed that the rapidly declining phase of the exothermic Hg2+ heat effect was abolished (Fig. 4C). The binding isotherm was complicated, containing at least two low affinity binding sites. Thus, we were not able to quantitatively assess the effect of Zn2+ on individual Hg2+ binding site. However, Zn2+ binding was clearly shown to inhibit the high affinity Hg2+ binding (Hg2+ site 1). Taken together, calorimetric titrations revealed at least two binding sites for each of Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+. All three metal ions bind to a common site (site 1) in a mutually competitive fashion. This common binding site is thermodynamically distinguishable as the exothermic binding site for Zn2+ and the higher binding affinity sites for Cd2+ and Hg2+, respectively. The relationship between the second sites is less clear. The Cd2+ site 2 and Hg2+ site 2 are independent of each other, but Zn2+ binding to the Zn2+ second site(s) appeared to interfere with bindings to both Cd2+ and Hg2+ second sites. The pH Dependence of Metal Ion Binding to YiiP—To test the involvement of histidine residues in metal ion binding, we examined the pH dependence of Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ titrations. The binding of a metal ion to the imidazole group (pKa = 6.2) of a histidine is coupled to the release of a proton. Acidic conditions would prevent proton release, thereby inhibiting metal binding. YiiP was purified with MES buffer at pH 5.5, and ITC experiments were performed in the identical MES mobile phase. Zn2+ titrations exhibited a predominantly endothermic reaction except that the early midrange of titrations consisted of biphasic heat effects, a fast endothermic process followed by a slow exothermic process (Fig. 5A). Deconvolution of this complicated binding isotherm was difficult. However, a comparison with the Zn2+ binding isotherms obtained at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2A) revealed a conspicuous loss of the exothermic heat profile, indicating that Zn2+ binding to the common site (Zn2+ site 1) was significantly inhibited at pH 5.5. The heat effects generated by Cd2+ titration remained purely exothermic, but the amplitude of the binding enthalpy was also significantly reduced (Fig. 5B). The best-fit of the Cd2+ binding isotherm to a two-site binding model yielded Ka1 = 3.15 ± 0.79 μm–1, n1 = 0.31 ± 0.01, and ΔH1 = –0.06 ± 0.16 kcal/mol; Ka2 = 0.15 ± 0.01 μm–1, n2 = 1.34 ± 0.02, and ΔH2 = –3.0 ± 0.08 kcal/mol. In addition to the decreases in binding enthalpy that occurred at both sites, the binding stoichiometries decreased from 1.2 to 0.31 for the high affinity site but increased from 0.84 to 1.34 for the low affinity site (Table I). The major pH effect on Cd2+ binding appears to occur at the high affinity site because of the significant reduction of both ΔH1 and n1. Nevertheless, a quantitative evaluation is not possible based on a simple comparison of fit parameters obtained in two pH buffers of different proton ionization enthalpies. In contrast to the strong pH dependences of Zn2+ and Cd2+, lowering the pH to 5.5 had little effect on Hg2+ binding. The Hg2+ binding isotherm obtained at pH 5.5 (Fig. 5C) was similar to that obtained at pH 7.0 (Fig. 4A). The best-fit to two sets of binding sites yielded Ka1 = 380 ± 90 μm–1, n1 = 0.71 ± 0.01, ΔH1 = –22.8 ± 0.2 kcal/mol; Ka2 = 0.4 ± 0.07 μm–1, n2 = 0.94 ± 0.02, ΔH2 = –9.9 ± 0.3 kcal/mol. These fit parameters are in the same range as those obtained at pH 7.0 (Table I), indicating that the Hg2+ binding to both site 1 and site 2 is retained at pH 5.5. The apparent lack of pH effect also suggests that the Hg2+ binding is not coupled to the deprotonation of histidine residues. Coupling of Cd2+ Binding to Deprotonation—To further evaluate the pH dependence of the Cd2+ binding, the apparent enthalpy change, ΔHapp, upon Cd2+ binding was obtained at pH 7.0 in three different pH buffers: HEPES, MOPSO, and ACES. The enthalpy change resulting from a possible proton exchange between a Cd2+ binding site and the pH buffer would contribute to the ΔHapp value. Therefore, correlating ΔHapp with the ionization enthalpy of the pH buffer would provide a quantitative evaluation of the binding-to-deprotonation coupling. Cd2+ binding isotherms were deconvoluted to yield two elementary ΔHapp values, corresponding to the binding to site 1 and site 2, respectively. The resulting ΔHapp is related to the ionization enthalpy of the pH buffer in which Cd2+ titrations were performed (Fig. 6) (23Goldberg R. Kishore N. Lennen R. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 2001; 30: 1-140Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Linear regressions yielded a slope of –1.23 for site 1 and –0.15 for site 2. According to the accumulative relationship, ΔHapp = ΔHbind+ nΔHion, the slopes of these linear regressions indicate that 1.23 protons are released from Cd2+ site 1, whereas 0.15 protons are released from Cd2+ site 2 upon Cd2+ binding at neutral pH. These results indicate that Cd2+ binding to the common site is coupled to a deprotonation process. Effect of DEPC on Metal Ion Binding—The coupling between Cd2+ binding and a deprotonation process at neutral pH is consistent with the involvement of histidine"
https://openalex.org/W2058056564,"Genetic studies on endoderm-mesoderm specification in Caenorhabditis elegans have demonstrated a role for several Wnt cascade components as well as for a MAPK-like pathway in this process. The latter pathway includes the MAPK kinase kinase-like MOM-4/Tak1, its adaptor TAP-1/Tab1, and the MAPK-like LIT-1/Nemo-like kinase. A model has been proposed in which the Tak1 kinase cascade counteracts the Wnt cascade at the level of β-catenin/TCF phosphorylation. In this model, the signal that activates the Tak1 kinase cascade is unknown. As an alternative explanation of these genetic data, we have explored whether Tak1 is directly activated by Wnt. We find that Wnt1 stimulation results in autophosphorylation and activation of MOM-4/Tak1 in a TAP-1/Tab1-dependent fashion. Wnt1-induced Tak1 stimulation activates Nemo-like kinase, resulting in the phosphorylation of TCF. Our results combined with the genetic data from C. elegans imply a mechanism whereby Wnt directly activates the MOM-4/Tak1 kinase signaling pathway. Thus, Wnt signal transduction through the canonical pathway activates β-catenin/TCF, whereas Wnt signal transduction through the Tak1 pathway phosphorylates and inhibits TCF, which might function as a feedback mechanism. Genetic studies on endoderm-mesoderm specification in Caenorhabditis elegans have demonstrated a role for several Wnt cascade components as well as for a MAPK-like pathway in this process. The latter pathway includes the MAPK kinase kinase-like MOM-4/Tak1, its adaptor TAP-1/Tab1, and the MAPK-like LIT-1/Nemo-like kinase. A model has been proposed in which the Tak1 kinase cascade counteracts the Wnt cascade at the level of β-catenin/TCF phosphorylation. In this model, the signal that activates the Tak1 kinase cascade is unknown. As an alternative explanation of these genetic data, we have explored whether Tak1 is directly activated by Wnt. We find that Wnt1 stimulation results in autophosphorylation and activation of MOM-4/Tak1 in a TAP-1/Tab1-dependent fashion.

Genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have shown that Wnt signaling acts very early in nematode development to induce endoderm. This induction occurs at the four-cell stage, when signaling from the posterior-most blastomere P2 polarizes a neighboring blastomere, EMS 1The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA-mediated interference; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKKK, MAPK kinase kinase; Nlk, Nemo-like kinase; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; HEK, human embryonic kidney; DN, dominant negative; EMS, endoderm-mesoderm; LiCl, lithium chloride; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; wrm, wormadillo; tak, TGF-β-activated kinase; mom, more mesoderm; pop, posterior pharynx-defective; Tak, TGF-β-activated kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA-mediated interference; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKKK, MAPK kinase kinase; Nlk, Nemo-like kinase; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; HEK, human embryonic kidney; DN, dominant negative; EMS, endoderm-mesoderm; LiCl, lithium chloride; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; wrm, wormadillo; tak, TGF-β-activated kinase; mom, more mesoderm; pop, posterior pharynx-defective; Tak, TGF-β-activated kinase.

The polarization of EMS results in the production of a daughter cell, E, which becomes endoderm, and another daughter cell, MS, which makes mesoderm. Genetic screens and RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) have identified several genes that are required to distinguish the fates of E and MS. Five of these are Wnt signaling pathway components: mom-1 (for more mesoderm) is similar to porcupine, mom-2 to wnt, mom-5 to frizzled, wrm-1 (for wormadillo) to Armadillo/β-catenin, and pop-1 (for posterior pharynx-defective) to TCF (3Kaletta T.

Wnts are a family of secreted proteins involved in a wide range of developmental processes and, as indicated above, control of asymmetric division and cell polarity. Wnts act by binding to frizzled receptors, which constitute a subfamily of seven-transmembrane-spanning proteins (9Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y.S. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). In the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, β-catenin is stabilized in the cytoplasm and forms a nuclear complex with members of the TCF/LEF family of DNA-binding molecules to activate transcription of target genes (10Cadigan K.M.

In most colorectal tumors, this stabilized β-catenin is the result of truncating mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor or of activating mutations that alter or delete regulatory phosphorylation sites in β-catenin (13Korinek V.

Mammalian Tak1 is related to MAPKKKs and was initially identified by complementation assays in yeast, where it can substitute for the MAPKKK Ste11p (22Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K.

Tab1 was identified as a specific interaction partner of Tak1 and activates Tak1 by directly binding to its catalytic domain (26Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Besides Tab1-induced Tak1 activation, Tak1 can be activated by a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism (27Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Tak1 activity regulates various downstream signal transduction pathways. It activates the NFκB transcription factor by stimulating the NFκB-inducing kinase or the IκB kinase (28Sakurai H. Shigemori N. Hasegawa K. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Most important for the current study, Tak1 functions upstream of the MAPK Nlk and enhances Nlk kinase activity (33Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nagai S. Nishita M. Meneghini M. Barker N. Waterman M. Bowerman B. Clevers H. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 399: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the C. elegans MOM-4/LIT-1 pathway converges with the Wnt cascade to down-regulate POP-1 in the posterior daughter cell E (8Rocheleau C.E. Yasuda J. Shin T.H. Lin R. Sawa H.

POP-1 is a substrate for LIT-1, and phosphorylation appears to relocalize POP-1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (8Rocheleau C.E. Yasuda J. Shin T.H. Lin R. Sawa H. Okano H. Priess J.R. Davis R.J. Mello C.C. Cell. 1999; 97: 717-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Similarly, Tak1 (the mammalian homologue of MOM-4) functions upstream of Nlk and TCF down-regulation is accomplished through the phosphorylation of TCFs by Nlk (33Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nagai S. Nishita M. Meneghini M. Barker N. Waterman M. Bowerman B. Clevers H. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 399: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The negative regulation of TCF/β-catenin by this Tak1/Nlk pathway raises the possibility that these kinases might control tumorigenesis in Wnt cascade-driven tumors. Tak1 can be activated by several stimuli, but the upstream cues that induce MOM-4/Tak1 to activate LIT-1/Nlk in worms or vertebrates remain largely unknown (Fig. 1A). In the present study, we analyzed whether the MOM-4/LIT-1 and the Tak1/Nlk signaling pathways are directly regulated by Wnts as suggested by genetic data from C. elegans (Fig. 1B). We find that Wnt stimulation results in Tak1 activation followed by the activation of Nlk. We provide evidence that Wnt can activate a MAPK signal transduction pathway that might function as an inhibitory feedback mechanism involved in fine-tuning the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

Ha-tagged Tak1 (K63W) and Ha-tagged Tak1 (S192A) were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using the following primers: (K63W), 5-′ GATGTCGCTATTTGGCAGATAGAAAGTGAG; (K63W), 3′-CTCACTTTCTATCTGCCAAATAGCGACATC; (S192A), 5′-CCAATAATAAAGGGGCTGCTGCTTGGATGGC; (S192A), 3′-GCCATCCAAGCAGCAGCCCCTTTATTATTGG. Wnt1 expression plasmids were generated by insertion of the Wnt1 cDNA into LZRS or pCDNA3 plasmids. TCF4-FLAG was generated by insertion of the TCF4 cDNA into FLAG-tagged pCDNA3.

The following primers were used: 5′-AGACCCATGGAATGTCTCAGTCGAAAGGCA, 3′-AGACGTCGACTTAGTCTCCAAGAATCAGT. PCR products were verified by sequencing. The cDNA for MKK6 was cloned into pRP259 (GST expressed at the C terminus). MKK6-GST construct was transformed in BL21 cells, and a 0.5-liter culture was grown at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.7. Isopropyl-β-d-galactosidase was added to 250 μm to induce protein expression, and the cells were cultured for another 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. Bacteria were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and the proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Reporter Gene Assays—HEK293T cells or the colon carcinoma cell lines LS174T, SW480, or DLD1 were seeded into 6-well (35 mm) plates (0.3 × 106 cells/well). 24 h later the cells were transfected by FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Plasmids that were transfected were TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH reporter plasmid, pCMV-RNL encoding Renilla luciferase as an internal control for transfection efficiency (Promega), Wnt5A, Wnt1, Nlk, DN-Nlk, or DN-Tak1 (or control) expression plasmids. The total amount of DNA was kept constant by supplementation with empty vector DNA. Luciferase and Renilla activity was determined with a luminometer using DLR (Promega). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—HEK293T cells or the C57MG cells with or without Wnt1 were seeded in 6-well (35 mm) plates (0.3 × 106 cells/well). 24 h later HEK293T were transfected by FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations with the indicated plasmids. The amount of DNA was kept constant by supplementation with empty vector DNA. The C57MG cells with or without Wnt1 were grown for 6 h in the absence of tetracycline. After 24 h of transfection or 6 h in the absence of tetracycline, cells were solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40 containing lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (complete mini-protease inhibitor mixture tablets). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 × g. For immunoblots, 10 μg of total protein was loaded in each lane. For immunoprecipitations, lysates with a total amount of 200 μg of protein were used. Protein immunopurification was done with 1 μg of antibody for 2 h at 4 °C; subsequently protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Technology) (5 μl) was added and incubated for one hour at 4 °C. Immunopurified proteins were washed three times with lysis buffer and eluted and denatured in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% 2-βmercaptoethanol). The immunoprecipitates and aliquots of total lysates were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C and resolved by SDS-PAGE. For immunoblots, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were incubated with 3% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% Tween (PBS/T)20 for 2 h at room temperature, incubated with the indicated first antibody for 2 h at room temperature, and washed three times with PBS/T. Bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to mouse, rabbit, or rat IgG using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Kinase Assays—Immunoprecipitates were incubated in kinase buffer containing 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 3.7 mm MgCl2, 4.6 mm MnCl2, and 5 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP at room temperature for 20 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of SDS sample buffer, and proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Wnt1 Stimulation Results in Autophosphorylation and Activation of MOM-4 —In C. elegans, genetic screens and RNAi have identified Wnt pathway genes and components of the MAPK-related pathway that are required for endoderm induction (3Kaletta T.

Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). We noted that these genetic data in C. elegans were compatible with a molecular mechanism in which Wnt/Frizzled directly activates the Tak1 pathway (Fig. 1B). To investigate this, we analyzed the effect of Wnt1 stimulation on the phosphorylation status of expressed MOM-4 in HEK293T cells. In the absence of Wnt signals, MOM-4 could be activated by overexpression of TAP-1 as evidenced by increased abundance and by a mobility shift, indicative of phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3, and 2D). Lower amounts of the MOM-4-binding protein TAP-1 did not induce the mobility shift of MOM-4 (Fig. 2A, lane 2). We then examined the effect of Wnt1 stimulation in the presence of these limiting amounts of TAP-1. Co-expression of MOM-4 and TAP-1 with increasing amounts of Wnt1 resulted in increased amounts and a mobility shift of MOM-4 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6, and 2B). In the absence of TAP-1 (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–9), Wnt1 stimulation did not induce the mobility shift of MOM-4. The Wnt1-induced increase in abundance of the MOM-4 protein varied somewhat between experiments (Fig. 2, compare A with D). To determine whether the MOM-4 mobility shift was caused by phosphorylation of MOM-4, Wnt1-stimulated samples were incubated with λ-phosphatase. This treatment decreased the intensity of the shifted MOM-4 (Fig. 2D), indicating that the mobility shift of MOM-4 was caused by phosphorylation. To determine whether the MOM-4 mobility shift induced by Wnt1 stimulation coincided with increased MOM-4 kinase activity, we performed an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2C). Overexpression of TAP-1 stimulated the autophosphorylating activity of MOM-4 (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–3). Interestingly, when Wnt1 was co-expressed with MOM-4 and limiting amounts of TAP-1, Wnt1 stimulation could induce the catalytic activity of the MOM-4 kinase (Fig. 2C, lanes 4–7). In the absence of the TAP-1 adaptor, no autophosphorylating activity of MOM-4 was observed (Fig. 2C, lanes 8–11). These observations led us to hypothesize that Wnt1 stimulation could activate autophosphorylation and, hence, the catalytic activity of MOM-4. However, upon stimulation with Wnt1, MOM-4 accumulates in cells, which made it difficult to distinguish between enhanced activation versus increased abundance of MOM-4. We therefore pursued the analysis of equal amounts of the MOM-4 complex from transfected HEK293T cells. Several transfections were performed to define conditions under which equal amounts of MOM-4 were produced in the various combinations (Fig. 2E). The amount of lysate was adjusted accordingly to allow equal amounts of the protein complexes to be subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. Upon Wnt1 stimulation, we thus found an increase in MOM-4 autophosphorylation (Fig. 2E). Additionally, we investigated whether Wnt1 stimulation could enhance phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate MKK6 by MOM-4. The phosphorylation of MKK6-GST by MOM-4 was enhanced compared with MKK6 phosphorylation in the absence of Wnt1 stimulation (Fig. 2E). These combined results indicated that Wnt1 induced the activation and autophosphorylation of MOM-4 in a TAP-1-dependent fashion. Wnt1 Stimulation Results in Autophosphorylation and Increased Kinase Activity of Tak1—We then asked whether the mammalian homologue of the MOM-4 kinase, Tak1 and its adaptor, Tab1, could also be activated by Wnt1 (Fig. 3). Tak1 was expressed together with increasing amounts of Wnt1 in the presence or absence of exogenous Tab1. Subsequently, Tak1 was immunopurified and an in vitro kinase assay was performed. Expression of increasing amounts of the adaptor Tab1 resulted in an increase in abundance and phosphorylation of Tak1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 3). Co-expression of Tak1, limiting amounts of Tab1, and increasing amounts of Wnt1 resulted in phosphorylation of Tak1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–6). We also observed a mobility shift of the Tak1 protein (Fig. 3A). To determine whether this was caused by phosphorylation of Tak1, Wnt1-stimulated samples were incubated with λ-phosphatase. This treatment decreased the intensity of the shifted Tak1, indicating that this was indeed the case (Fig. 3B). Wnt1 could still induce some increase in phosphorylation of Tak1 in the absence of exogenous Tab1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–9). Although we cannot formally rule out that Tab1 is dispensable for the Wnt-induced activation of Tak1, we believe that endogenously expressed Tab1 in HEK293T cells suffices for activation of Tak1 by Wnt1. To determine whether there is an increase in Tak1 kinase activity after Wnt1 induction, we performed an in vitro kinase assay. Wnt1 induced the catalytic activity of Tak1 as visualized by autophosphorylation of Tak1 (Fig. 3C, anti-Ha) and phosphorylation of Tab1 (Fig. 3B, anti-T7). These observations led us to hypothesize that Wnt1 stimulation could activate autophosphorylation and, hence, the catalytic activity of Tak1. However, like MOM-4, Tak1 accumulates in cells upon stimulation with Wnt1, which makes it difficult to distinguish between enhanced activation and abundance of Tak1. Therefore, we again adjusted transfection conditions to generate comparable amounts of Tak1 (Fig. 3D). The amount of lysate was adjusted to analyze identical amounts of the protein complexes in an in vitro kinase assay. Thus, we found that Wnt stimulation led to a strong increase in Tak1 autophosphorylation (Fig. 3D). Additionally, we investigated whether Wnt1 stimulation could enhance phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate MKK6 by Tak1. Indeed, the phosphorylation of MKK6-GST by Tak1 was enhanced, compared with phosphorylation in the absence of Wnt1 stimulation (Fig. 3D). These combined results indicated that Wnt1 induced the activation and autophosphorylation of Tak1. Wnt1 Stimulates the Kinase Activity of Nlk via Tak1—To address whether endogenous Tak1 kinase is connected to the Wnt1 signal transduction machinery, we performed an in vitro kinase assay on immunopurified Tak1 from C57MG cells that were induced to express Wnt1 (35Korinek V. Barker N. Willert K. Molenaar M. Roose J. Wagenaa R.G. Markman M. Lamers W. Destree O. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 3: 1248-1256Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Induction of Wnt1 by removal of tetracycline indeed induced the kinase activity of endogenous Tak1 in C57MG cells (Fig. 4A). We were not able to immunopurify endogenous Tak1 from HEK293T cells for in vitro kinase assays because of the low expression level of Tak1 in HEK293T cells. Nlk is a 60-kDa threonine/serine protein kinase that can be activated by Tak1 (33Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nagai S. Nishita M. Meneghini M. Barker N. Waterman M. Bowerman B. Clevers H. Shibuya H.

A. 1998; 95: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Nlk can phosphorylate TCFs, thereby down-regulating TCF transcriptional activity (33Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nagai S. Nishita M. Meneghini M. Barker N. Waterman M. Bowerman B. Clevers H. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 399: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). To test whether Nlk activity is modulated by Wnt1 stimulation via Tak1, we co-expressed Nlk-FLAG with Wnt1 in HEK293T cells. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody (Nlk), and the immunopurified Nlk was subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. We observed that Wnt1 induced an increase in Nlk kinase activity (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2), presumably through the activation of endogenous Tak1. Co-expression of wild type Tak1 with Nlk also resulted in an increase in Nlk kinase activity (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 3), suggesting that both Wnt1 and Tak1 are upstream activators of Nlk. We next examined whether Wnt1-induced activation of Nlk was indeed mediated via endogenous Tak1. To that end, we co-transfected Nlk with Wnt1 and either of two dominant negative (DN) Tak1 constructs (Tak1-K63W and Tak1-S192A). The K63W-Tak1 mutant lacks kinase activity and is not phosphorylated following Wnt1 stimulation or when coexpressed with Tab1 (data not shown). The activation of many protein kinases, including MAPKKKs, involves the phosphorylation of serine and/or threonine residues in a region termed the kinase activation loop between subdomains VII and VIII (37Kishimoto K.

Here we infect both normal and CCR5-deficient mice with the bacterium Yersinia pestis, the cause of the plague epidemics that wiped out one-third of Europeans in the Middle Ages3, and find no difference in either bacterial growth or survival time between the two groups. Unless the pathogenesis of Yersinia infection differs markedly between mice and humans, our results indicate that CCR5 deficiency in people is unlikely to protect against plague."
https://openalex.org/W1966849099,"Based on the 1H-15N NMR spectroscopy data, the three-dimensional structure and internal dynamic properties of ribosomal protein L7 from Escherichia coli were derived. The structure of L7 dimer in solution can be described as a set of three distinct domains, tumbling rather independently and linked via flexible hinge regions. The dimeric N-terminal domain (residues 1-32) consists of two antiparallel α-α-hairpins forming a symmetrical four-helical bundle, whereas the two identical C-terminal domains (residues 52-120) adopt a compact α/β-fold. There is an indirect evidence of the existence of transitory helical structures at least in the first part (residues 33-43) of the hinge region. Combining structural data for the ribosomal protein L7/L12 from NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography, it was suggested that its hinge region acts as a molecular switch, initiating “ratchet-like” motions of the L7/L12 stalk with respect to the ribosomal surface in response to elongation factor binding and GTP hydrolysis. This hypothesis allows an explanation of events observed during the translation cycle and provides useful insights into the role of protein L7/L12 in the functioning of the ribosome.

Ribosomes are complex and dynamic ribonucleoprotein assemblies, which provide the framework for protein biosynthesis in all organisms (for review see Refs. 1Ramakrishnan V.

One of the most remarkable features of the large subunit of the ribosome is the presence of a highly flexible protuberance called the stalk (for review see Refs. 5Liljas A. Gudkov A.T. Biochimie (Paris). 1987; 69: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Gudkov A.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Wahl M.C. Moller W. Curr.

Various conformations of the stalk are thought to reflect different functional states of the ribosome, which are essential for tRNA binding and translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from A- to P-site. In prokaryotes, the stalk includes a highly conserved acidic 12-kDa protein L7/L12 (L7 is the N-terminal acetylated form of L12), which is present in four copies as two dimers associated with other ribosomal components via protein L10. Both L7/L12 dimers are necessary for optimal rates of protein synthesis and proper function of elongation factors, but a single dimer is sufficient for ribosomal activity (9Griaznova O. Traut R.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4075-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Spatial contacts of the L7/L12 stalk with elongation factors G and Tu (EF-G and EF-Tu) 1The abbreviations used are: EF, elongation factor; NTD, N-terminal domain; CTD, C-terminal domain; dNTD, dimeric NTD; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; RDC, residual 1H-15N dipolar coupling; Dr, diffusion tensor; PDB, Protein Data Bank. 1The abbreviations used are: EF, elongation factor; NTD, N-terminal domain; CTD, C-terminal domain; dNTD, dimeric NTD; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; RDC, residual 1H-15N dipolar coupling; Dr, diffusion tensor; PDB, Protein Data Bank. were observed by electron cryomicroscopy (10Stark H.

Wintermeyer W. Cell. 2000; 100: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) in keeping with the importance of L7/L12 for either factor binding to ribosome or stimulation of factor-depended GTPase activity (12Mohr D. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12520-12528Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, conformational changes in L7/L12 were revealed by limited proteolysis upon EF-G and EF-Tu binding with GTP or GDP to ribosome (13Gudkov A.T. Bubunenko V.G. Biochimie (Paris). 1989; 71: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Current x-ray crystallographic analysis failed to resolve the fine structural state of L7/L12 within the ribosome, because electron density for L7/L12 stalk was not apparent even in the recent 2.4-Å resolution structure of the large ribosomal subunit (14Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2777) Google Scholar). Thus, high resolution x-ray crystallographic and NMR studies of the isolated protein L7/L12 and its complex with the protein L10 may still provide valuable insights into the atomic structures of the L7/L12 stalk.Based on structural and biochemical investigations, the protein L7/L12 is composed of two distinct, organized domains connected by an extensive linker, the so-called “hinge” region (5Liljas A. Gudkov A.T. Biochimie (Paris). 1987; 69: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Gudkov A.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Wahl M.C.

Gudkov A.T. Liljas A. Sepetov N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4498-4505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (NTD) is responsible for L7/L12 dimerization and for anchoring the protein to the ribosome, whereas the C-terminal domain (CTD) is involved in translation factor interaction (6Gudkov A.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In solution, the hinge regions of L7/L12 dimer have an unordered flexible structure that enables independent movement of both CTDs relative to each other and to the dimeric N-terminal domain (dNTD) (15Bushuev V.N.

The removal of one but not two CTDs from L7/L12 dimer gives no marked effect on the ribosomal translation activity (20Oleinikov A.V. Jokhadze G.G. Traut R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95 (03432): 4215-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), whereas the deletions of the hinge residues significantly reduce the mobility of the CTDs and decrease activity of the modified ribosome (21Bubunenko M.G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 917-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier, the crystal structure of Escherichia coli L7/L12 C-terminal fragment consisting of three β-strands and three α-helices had been solved at a 1.7-Å resolution (23Leijonmarck M. Liljas A. J. Mol. Biol. Chem. 1987; 247: 3622-3629Google Scholar). NMR study of the E. coli L7 dimer in solution has shown α-helical hairpin conformation of NTD (16Bocharov E.V. Gudkov A.T. Arseniev A.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Bocharov E.V. Gudkov A.T. Budovskaya E.V. Arseniev A.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of isolated L12 from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima with two full-length molecules and two proteolysed N-terminal fragments associated into tetramer in the asymmetric unit was reported (24Wahl M.C. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The T. maritima protein L7/L12 is highly homologous to the E. coli counterpart with 64.7% sequence identity. In contrast to the parallel arrangement of the subunits in the dNTD assumed earlier (16Bocharov E.V. Gudkov A.T. Arseniev A.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), this crystal structure reveals antiparallel arrangement. Another important finding is that in crystal the hinge region of the full-length molecules is contracted into long α-helix, which folds back on the NTD forming a compact overall protein structure, whereas the restricted hinge regions of the L12 fragments adopted elongated, unstructured conformations (24Wahl M.C. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, the hinge regions from the full-length molecules bind to each other, which result in additional intermolecular contacts between the N- and C-terminal domains in the crystalline L12 tetramer. Thus, the protein L7/L12 in crystal has a very compact structure different from the solution model in which the N- and C-terminal domains are separated by a stretched and flexible hinge region (19Bocharov E.V. Gudkov A.T. Budovskaya E.V. Arseniev A.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the high resolution structure of protein L7/L12 in solution was not obtained to date and the molecular details of function of this protein during the translation process are still not fully understood. In this study, we have determined the spatial structure and characterized the internal dynamics of protein L7 from E. coli in solution by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Based on this information along with the available structural and biochemical data, a model of L7/L12 molecular switching during the translation process is proposed. This provides useful insights into the role of protein L7/L12 in the functioning of the ribosome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were performed on 600 MHz (1H) Varian Unity spectrometer equipped with pulsed-field gradient unit and triple resonance probe. NMR spectra were acquired at 30 °C using 1 mm samples of uniformly 15N-labeled L7 dissolved at pH 6.9 in 600 μl of buffer solution containing 0.05 m sodium phosphate, 0.1 m KCl and either 90% H2O, 10% D2O or 99.9% D2O. Details of the protein preparation and NMR experiments used to assign 1H-15N resonances (BioMagResBank accession number 4429) and determine the L7 secondary structure are documented elsewhere (16Bocharov E.V. Gudkov A.T. Arseniev A.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). During the course of NMR data collection, there were no detectable changes in NMR spectra because of spontaneous proteolysis of L7 dimer (25Liljas A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1982; 40: 161-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The interproton distance restraints used in this work for L7 structure calculation were obtained from three-dimensional 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC (60-ms mixing time) experiment featuring pulsed-field gradient coherence selection, sensitivity enhancement, and flip-back pulse for minimizing saturation of water (26Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional NOESY (60-ms mixing time) spectrum acquired for the D2O sample was also used as an additional source to the structure information concerning aromatic rings of phenylalanine residues. Dihedral angle restraints were estimated from homonuclear 3JHNα and heteronuclear 3JNβ coupling constants obtained quantitatively from two-dimensional 1H-15N HMQCJ (27Kay L.E. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 86: 110-126Google Scholar) and qualitatively from three-dimensional 1H-15N HNHB (28Archer S.J. Ikura M. Torchi D.A. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 636-641Google Scholar) experiments, respectively. The preliminary stereospecific assignments of methylene β-protons were deduced by inspection of the relative cross-peak intensities in three-dimensional 1H-15N HNHB, 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC (60-ms mixing time), and 1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC (26Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) (50-ms mixing time) spectra. The slowly exchanging amide protons were identified by reconstituting lyophilized L7 sample in D2O and immediately recording a series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra (30-min duration each) over 4 h at 23 °C.Residual 1H-15N dipolar couplings (RDCs) were extracted from 1JNH-modulated HSQC experiments (29Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6264-6272Crossref Scopus (313) Google Scholar) collected on isotropic L7 sample and on partially aligned L7 samples containing the liquid crystalline phase of Tobacco mosaic virus (30Clore G.M. Starich M.R. Gronenborn A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10571-10572Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar) or dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine/dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine mixture (1:2.9 molar ratio, 6.5% lipid (w/v)) (31Bax A. Tjandra N. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Alignments of both media were confirmed by observation of the quadrupole splitting of the D2O signal. The splitting of 16 or 8 Hz was achieved for a sample containing virus particles or lipid bicelles, respectively. Sample homogeneity and stability were controlled before and after RDC measurements by arrayed deuterium experiments with slice selection gradients. In both lipid and virus media, the legitimate dipolar couplings were observed only for the residues from the CTD (see Supplementary data).15N relaxation measurements were performed using the pulse sequences by Farrow et al. (32Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar) at 14.1 T and 30 °C. The values of 15N longitudinal (R1) and transverse (R2) relaxation rates were obtained by exponential fitting of the intensities of cross-peaks in sets of two-dimensional 1H-15N correlation spectra recorded with relaxation delays ranging from 10 to 1000 ms and from 0 to 200 ms in R1 and R2 experiments, respectively. The R2 data were numerically corrected to account for off-resonance effects associated with the CPMG (Carr-Pur-cell-Meiboom-Gill) refocusing pulses (33Korzhnev D.M. Tischenko E.V. Arseniev A.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 17: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The values of heteronuclear 15N{1H} steady-state NOE were measured as a ratio of signal intensities in two-dimensional 1H-15N correlation spectra recorded with and without prior saturation of amide protons achieved by a sequence of 120° 1H pulses spaced by 1.0 ms. The delay between scans in 15N R1 and R2 and in 15N{1H} NOE experiments was 2.5 and 5.0 s, respectively. The R1, R2, and NOE measurements were repeated several times, and resulting values were averaged over all of the recorded data sets. The relaxation data analysis and hydrodynamic calculations were performed using DASHA program (see Supplementary data) (34Orekhov V.Y. Nolde D.E. Golovanov A.P. Korzhnev D.M. Arseniev A.S. Appl. Magn. Reson. 1995; 9: 581-588Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Structure Calculations—Spatial structure calculations were performed using the programs DYANA 1.5 (35Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar) and CYANA 1.01 (www.guentert.com), which employ simulated annealing combined with molecular dynamics in torsion angle space. Meaningful upper distance restraints were derived using CALIBA (36Güntert P. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) function of DYANA from the volumes of NOE cross-peaks integrated in the NOESY spectra by the program XEASY (37Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). The semiautomatic assignments of NOE cross-peaks were obtained with the program XEASY and NOAH (38Mumenthaler C. Güntert P. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) subroutine of DYANA package. Stereospecific assignments and torsion angle restraints for ϕ, φ, and χ1 were obtained by the analysis of local conformation in GRIDSEARCH (39Güntert P. Billeter M. Ohlenschlager O. Brown L.R. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and GLOMSA (36Güntert P. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) subroutines of DYANA using the available homonuclear 3JHNα and heteronuclear 3JNβ spin-spin-coupling constants and sequential NOE data. The slowly exchanging amide protons were assigned as hydrogen bond donors with related hydrogen-acceptor partners on the basis of preliminary structure calculations. Corresponding hydrogen bond restraints were employed in subsequent calculations for d(O,N), d(O,HN), and d(C,HN) distances in accordance with angle and distance criteria for different types of hydrogen bonds (40Baker E.N. Hubbard R.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar).During preliminary rounds of structure calculations (obtained without account for RDCs), typically 100-200 structures were generated using 5,000 simulated annealing steps followed by 1,200 steps of conjugate gradient minimization with 10-20 structures being retained according to their standard DYANA target function values for relaxation matrix back-calculations of the NOEs and for analysis of hydrogen bonds, stereospecific assignments, and ambiguous NOEs. In the final cycle of calculations, the standard CYANA-simulated annealing protocol (modified to incorporate refinement against RDC restraints after employing distance and dihedral angle restraints) was applied to 200 random structures and the resulting 20 structures with the lowest target function were selected. Constrained energy minimization of the side chains of the 20 best CYANA structures was performed in the program FANTOM (41Schaumann T. Braun W. Wüthrich K. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 679-694Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) using ECEPP/2 potential with available distance and dihedral angle restraints. The mean structure calculation of the CYANA family and the analyses of root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.), secondary structure, and hydrogen bonds were performed with MOLMOL (42Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6468) Google Scholar). Spatial distribution of electrostatic potential on the protein solvent-accessible surfaces and figures of the structures were generated by MOLMOL (42Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6468) Google Scholar). The molecular hydrophobicity potential created by protein atoms on the protein solvent-accessible surface was calculated as described previously (43Efremov R.G. Vergoten G. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 10658-10666Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The calculation and visualization of molecular hydrophobicity potential was done using the homemade software.RESULTSN- and C-terminal Domains of L7 Dimer Tumble at Different Rates—The 15N{1H} NOE, 15N R1, and R2 values measured for the backbone 15N nuclei of the L7 dimer (Fig. 1, a-c) exhibit significant variations along the protein sequence. Moreover, it is clearly seen from the relaxation data (Fig. 1, a-c) that L7 consists of two relatively stable N- and C-terminal domains separated by mobile hinge region spanning residues 33-51. A more rigid part of the NTD comprises the residues from 3 to 31 with mean 15N R1 and R2 values of 1.53 ± 0.05 s-1 and 14.1 ± 1.7 s-1, respectively. The CTD spreads over the residues 52-120 with mean 15N R1 and R2 values of 1.72 ± 0.14 s-1 and 10.7 ± 1.1 s-1, respectively. The 15N nuclei of both N- and C-terminal domains have high positive 15N{1H} NOEs (Fig. 1a), which suggest restricted internal mobility for the NH vectors in pico-nanosecond time scale. Additionally, residues Phe30 and Asn64 from these domains have pronounced enhanced R2, pointing to the micro-millisecond conformational exchange (see Supplementary data). In contrast, the residues 1-2 and 33-51 from N terminus and hinge region, respectively, have nearly unrestricted mobility, resulting in low and negative 15N{1H} NOE and decreased 15N R1 and R2 rates (Fig. 1, a-c). The amides of Ser1 and the hinge region residues, with the exception of Val38 and Val40, have intensive water-exchange cross-peaks in the 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC spectrum. Besides, the residues within the hinge region display only trivial sequential NOE connectivities. Hence, interdomain linker of L7 exhibits all of the hallmarks of a mobile and unstructured region that is exposed to the aqueous environment.Different mean values of R1 and R2 for 15N nuclei of the L7 N- and C-terminal domains strongly suggest that rotational diffusion of the domains occurs at different rates. This becomes evident from the local rotational correlation times calculated from R2/R1 ratios of the individual 15N nuclei of L7 (Fig. 1d). The overall rotation correlation times, τR calculated from R2/R1 ratio averaged over 15N nuclei with 1H{15N} NOE higher than 0.6 (47Korzhnev D.M. Billeter M. Arseniev A.S. Orekhov V.Y. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2001; 38: 197-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (188) Google Scholar) are 9.45 ± 0.25 and 7.28 ± 0.76 ns for the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively. Using the empirical dependence of the overall correlation time on the number of residues in globular proteins (44Daragan V.A. Mayo K.H. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1997; 31: 63-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (221) Google Scholar), one can estimate that the dNTD and each of the CTDs of the L7 dimer, having a total of 240 residues, tumble at the same rates as compact proteins of 152 and 115 residues, respectively. These values exceed the actual molecular sizes of the dNTD and the CTD by approximately 88 and 46 residues, respectively. Hence, the interaction of CTD-dNTD-CTD over long flexible hinge regions gives almost equal “overweight” by 45 residues to the size of the NTD (residues 1-32) and the CTD (residues 52-120). This proves our choice of the domain boundaries within a few amino acids. Thus, according to the overall structure of L7/L12 in solution (19Bocharov E.V. Gudkov A.T. Budovskaya E.V. Arseniev A.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) where it forms a stable dimer with subunits interacting by the NTDs, one can suggest a model for its rotational diffusion assuming that L7/L12 dimer behaves as a set of three almost independent domains linked by flexible hinges. Namely, the dNTD of L7/L12 dimer behaves as a core unit, whereas two mutually independent CTDs diffuse as wings weakly interacting with the core. That is in agreement with the previous results of NMR and fluorescence polarization measurements, suggesting that a hierarchy of motions exists in the L7/L12 molecule including facile motions of the dNTD and the two CTDs, in addition to the overall tumbling of the protein (17Hamman B.D.

Structure calculation protocol for the dNTD is described in Supplementary data. The full set of input data for structure calculation of the dimer included 686 NOE distance restraints, upper and lower distance restraints for 30 hydrogen bonds, 198 backbone, ϕ and φ, and side chain, χ1, dihedral angle restraints. A representative ensemble of the 20 structures of the dNTD with small violations and low molecular energies is shown in Fig. 2a.

Two final sets of 20 best CTD structures were obtained using separately 66 or 58 1H-15N RDC measured in the alignment media containing the virus particles (Fig. 2b) or the lipid bicelles, respectively. In both virus and lipid media, the backbone conformations of the CTD comprising residues 52-120 are well defined and the overall mean global r.m.s.d. from the average structure are, respectively, 0.36 and 0.47 Å for backbone atoms.A survey of the structural statistics and residual violations of experimental restraints for the dNTD and CTD ensembles is provided in the Table I. The atomic coordinates and experimental restrains for the representative structures and the ensembles of 20 structures of the dNTD and CTD (in virus alignment medium) of L7 dimer in solution have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under accession codes 1RQT and 1RQS, respectively. Additionally, two representative structures of whole L7 dimer (PDB accession code 1RQU and 1RQV) were generated using the NMR structures of the L7 domains mutually remote and linked by two hinge regions, both of which were unstructured or one of them had been turned in a helix with a fashion similar to the crystal structure (24Wahl M.C.

https://openalex.org/W1980252708,"NM23-H1 belongs to a family of eight gene products in humans that have been implicated in cellular differentiation and development, as well as oncogenesis and tumor metastasis. We have defined NM23-H1 biochemically as a 3′-5′ exonuclease by virtue of its ability in stoichiometric amounts to excise single nucleotides in a stepwise manner from the 3′ terminus of DNA. The activity is dependent upon the presence of Mg2+, is most pronounced with single-stranded substrates or mismatched bases at the 3′ terminus of double-stranded substrates, and is inhibited by both ATP and the incorporation of cordycepin, a 2′-deoxyadenosine analogue, into the 3′-terminal position. The 3′-5′ exonuclease activity was assigned to NM23-H1 by virtue of: 1) precise coelution of enzymatic activity with wild-type and mutant forms of NM23-H1 protein during purification by hydroxylapatite and gel filtration column high performance liquid chromatography and 2) significantly diminished activity exhibited by purified recombinant mutant forms of the proteins. Lysine 12 appears to play an important role in the catalytic mechanism, as evidenced by the significant reduction in 3′-5′ exonuclease activity resulting from a Lys12 to glutamine substitution within the protein. 3′-5′ Exonucleases are believed to play an important role in DNA repair, a logical candidate function underlying the putative antimetastatic and oncogenic activities of NM23-H1.

Subsequently, low expression of the NM23-H1 protein has been linked to increased metastatic potential in human breast carcinoma (2Bevilacqua G. Sobel M. Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5185-5190PubMed Google Scholar), hepatoma (3Nakayama T. Ohtsuru A. Nakao K. Shima M. Nakata K. Watanabe K. Ishii N. Kimura N. Nagataki S. J. Natl.

Cancer Res. 1993; 84: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). NM23-H1 overexpression has been shown experimentally to inhibit the metastatic phenotype and/or promote differentiation in melanoma (5Leone A. Flatow U. King C.R. Sandeen M.A. Margulies I.M.

Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 1743-1749PubMed Google Scholar). The human nm23-H1 gene is one of eight related NM23 family members identified to date (reviewed in Ref. 9Lacombe M.-L. Milon L. Mehus J.G. Lambeth D.O. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Each exhibits nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDPK) 1The abbreviations used are: NDPK, nucleoside-diphosphate kinase; AP, apurinic; H1, NM23-H1; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HTP, hydroxyapatite; NHE, nuclease hypersensitive element; nt, nucleotide(s); PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; WRN, Werner syndrome protein; 5′-SHS, 5′-S1 hypersensitive sequence; ATPγS, adenosine-5′-O-3-thiotriphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: NDPK, nucleoside-diphosphate kinase; AP, apurinic; H1, NM23-H1; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HTP, hydroxyapatite; NHE, nuclease hypersensitive element; nt, nucleotide(s); PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; WRN, Werner syndrome protein; 5′-SHS, 5′-S1 hypersensitive sequence; ATPγS, adenosine-5′-O-3-thiotriphosphate. activity, catalyzing the transfer of γ-phosphate between nucleoside triphosphate and nucleoside diphosphate via a “ping-pong” mechanism (10Agarwal R.P. Robinson B. Parks R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). NDPK activity does not appear to be relevant to metastasis suppression, however, as catalytically inactive mutants retain metastasis suppressor activity (11Lee H.Y. Lee H. Cancer Lett. 1999; 145: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Hamby C.V. Abbi R. Prasad N. Stauffer C. Thomson J. Mendola C.E. Sidorov V. Backer J.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition to NDPK, a number of other biological activities have been reported for NM23 proteins, some of which have been proposed to underlie metastasis suppression. Two spontaneous mutations in NM23-H1, a serine 120 to glycine (S120G) substitution seen frequently in aggressive neuroblastomas (13Chang C.L. Zhu X.X. Thoraval D.H. Ungar D. Rawwas J. Hora N. Strahler J.R. Hanash S.M. Radany E. Nature. 1994; 370: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and a proline 96 to serine mutation that corresponds to the killer of prune mutation (Kpn; P96S) in the Drosophila homologue of NM23 (awd), both result in loss of antimetastatic activity (14MacDonald N.J. Freije J.M. Stracke M.L. Manrow R.E. Steeg P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25107-25116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both mutations also abrogate a histidine-dependent protein kinase activity of NM23-H1 (15Wagner P.D. Vu N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21758-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This activity has been implicated more recently in the serine phosphorylation of the kinase suppressor of ras (KSR), suggesting antimetastatic activity may arise via the suppression of ras-initiated growth signals (16Hartsough M.T. Morrison D.K. Salerno M. Palmieri D. Ouatas T. Mair M. Patrick J. Steeg P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32389-32399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence has also been presented to indicate that NM23 proteins interact with DNA. NM23-H2 has been shown to bind and activate the nuclease-hypersensitive element (NHE) of the c-myc promoter (17Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 18Berberich S.J. Postel E.H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2343-2347PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a molecular mechanism of oncogenesis and malignant progression. NM23-H2 also cleaves the NHE sequence in vitro when presented in either linear or supercoiled plasmid form (19Postel E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in modulating transcription via the remodeling of regulatory elements that exhibit non-B-form, or paranemic, DNA conformations (for a review, see Ref. 20Postel E. Berberich S.J. Rooney J.W. Kaetzel D.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Each of these interactions with the NHE were independent of NDPK activity, as they were retained with an NDPK-defective mutant form (H118F) of the protein (21Postel E. Ferrone C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8627-8630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA cleaving activity of NM23-H2 was further shown to occur via a DNA glycosylase/lyase-like mechanism (22Postel E. Abramczyk B.M. Levit M.N. Kyin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 97: 14194-14199Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), a hallmark of base excision DNA repair enzymes. Both NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 repress transcription via interactions with paranemic elements in the promoter region of the platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A) gene (23Ma D. Xing Z. Liu B. Pedigo N. Zimmer S. Bai Z. Postel E. Kaetzel D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1560-1567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Kaetzel D.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 427-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Repression of this oncogenic and metastasis-promoting growth factor (25Anan K. Morisaki T. Katano M. Ikubo A. Kitsuki H. Uchiyama A. Kuroki S. Tanaka M. Torisu M. Surgery. 1996; 119: 333-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) is consistent with a potential antimetastatic function of NM23 proteins. Interestingly, NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 also cleaved the PDGF-A regulatory elements in vitro; NM23-H1 appeared to excise nucleotides progressively from the 3′ terminus of single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides, whereas NM23-H2 appeared to cleave internally, as observed previously with the c-myc NHE sequence. Interestingly, the DNA cleavage function of NM23 is conserved from the primordial NDPK gene in Escherichia coli (26Levit M.N. Abramczyk B.M. Stock J.B. Postel E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5163-5167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A recent study has also shown that NM23-H1 is the DNA-cleaving component of a latent protein complex (SET) that is activated during cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated apoptosis (27Fan Z. Beresford P.J. Oh D.Y. Zhang D. Lieberman J. Cell. 2003; 112: 659-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). While observed in the context of the immune response, this finding suggests that proapoptotic or immunosurveillance functions may underlie the antimetastatic activity of NM23-H1. In this report we show that human NM23-H1 that is expressed in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity exhibits biochemical characteristics consistent with 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. 3′-5′ Exonucleases are associated generally with DNA proofreading (reviewed in Ref. 28Shevelev I.V. Hübscher U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 1-12Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar), with loss of expression and/or function often associated with mutator phenotypes, and increased potential for cancer progression (29Jackson A. Loeb L.A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1483-1490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of NM23-H1 demonstrated in this report would appear to represent a logical candidate function underlying its antimetastatic activity. DNA and Site-directed Mutagenesis—E. coli plasmids (pET3c, New England Biolabs) for expression of wild-type NM23-H1 and its mutant variants, R34A and H118F, were kindly provided by E. Postel (Princeton). K12Q was generated by the overlap extension modification of the polymerase chain reaction (30Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6832) Google Scholar) using the sequences 5′-cgggatcccatatggccaactgtga-3′ and 5′-ccggatccccgaattctcattcatagatccagt-3′ as 5′- and 3′-end primers, respectively, and the mutagenic primers 5′-cccatctggctggatcgcaatgaaggtac-3′ and 5′-cattgcgatccagccagatggggtcca-3′ (codons encoding the mutant glutamine residue are in underlined bold font). The cDNA sequence encoding K12Q was inserted in-frame between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET3c. The cloned PCR product was sequenced to ensure that only the desired mutation was present. Overexpression and Purification of Recombinant Human NM23-H1—NM23-H1 and mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli essentially as described (23Ma D. Xing Z. Liu B. Pedigo N. Zimmer S. Bai Z. Postel E. Kaetzel D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1560-1567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, pET3c vectors containing wild-type and variants of NM23-H1 were used to transform E. coli (BL21 plysS; Promega). For protein expression, freshly transformed bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB-ampicillin medium. Two ml of the overnight culture was used to inoculate 200 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin. When the A600 reached 0.6, protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.4 mm). Three hours following induction, cells were harvested, resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and dithiothreitol, 1 mm leupeptin and pepstatin A, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and lysed by sonication. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min and the proteins were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (60-90% fractions). The 60-90% fraction was prepared for application to a DEAE-Sephacel column by dialysis into 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. Under these conditions, NM23-H1 bound to the column and was eluted with a 0-1 m NaCl gradient with the peak fraction at ∼350 mm NaCl. Peak fractions containing NM23 proteins were equilibrated in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) by centrifugal filtration (Centricon-10, Millipore) and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite (HTP) column. NM23-H1 was eluted with a 80-ml phosphate gradient of 10-800 mm. Purity of recombinant proteins was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Commassie Blue and/or silver staining. Unless otherwise indicated, only the 1-ml peak fraction was employed for cleavage assays. DNA Cleavage Assays—A number of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide sequences employed for cleavage assays were derived from either the 5′-SHS silencer or the NHE elements found in the 5′-flanking region of the PDGF-A promoter (Table I; Refs. 23Ma D.

Oligodeoxyribonucleotides 12-15 were substrates of the WRN helicase/exonuclease provided by David Orren (University of Kentucky). Radiolabeling of 5′ termini was performed in a 40-μl reaction mixture at 37 °C for 30 min using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Double-stranded probes were annealed by incubation of the radiolabeled single strand of interest with its complement at 95 °C for 5 min followed by gradual cooling to ambient room temperature over a 3-h interval. For 3′-end labeling, the strand to be labeled was first annealed to a complementary strand designed to provide a duplex with a 5′-overhang. The recessed 3′ terminus was filled in with [α-32P]dCTP in the presence of the three remaining unlabeled nucleotides and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. To prepare a doubled-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe with the 2′-deoxyadenosine analogue cordycepin at the 3′ terminus, the purine-rich strand of NHE was first 5′-labeled with γ-32P and T4 polynucleotide kinase, then annealed to its complementary pyrimidine-rich strand (9-bp mismatch, oligonucleotide number 3). This duplex was incubated with 10 mm cordycepin 5′-triphosphate and terminal transferase at 37 °C for 1 h (specific activity: ∼1.0 × 106 cpm/pmol). Routine DNA cleavage assays were performed in a 15-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.9), 10-50 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide, 2 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl as described previously (23Ma D.

Standard reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.5-1 μg of protein and carried out at room temperature. Reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of sequencing loading dye consisting of 80% deionized formamide (w/v), 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), xylene cyanol FF (1 mg/ml), and bromphenol blue (1 mg/ml) followed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min.

Open table in a new tab Nucleoside-diphosphate Kinase Assays—NDPK activity was measured as described (10Agarwal R.P. Robinson B. Parks R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) in a coupled pyruvate-lactate dehydrogenase assay in which ATP acted as a phosphate donor and dTDP as an acceptor. The procedure was modified for the current study to accommodate the use of 96-well plates and microplate reader. NDPK reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of purified NM23-H1 in 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.9) into individual wells of a 96-well plate, each containing 140 μl of reaction mixture consisting of 1 mm pyruvate enol phosphate, 5 mm ATP, 2.5 mm dTDP, 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1000 units of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. NAD+ formation, which reflected ADP production, was measured every 25 s at 340 nm by a HTS 7000 plus Bioassay Plate Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Specific activity was expressed as units/mg of protein, with 1 unit defined as the amount of enzyme converting 1 μmol of ADP/min at room temperature (ϵ340 of NADH = 6.22 × 103m-1 cm-1). Circular Dichroism Analysis—Far UV-CD spectra were recorded from 260 to 190 nm using a Jasco J-810 spectrometer, with each individual spectrum representing the average of 30 replicate measurements. Prior to analysis, purified NM23-H1 proteins were diluted to a concentration of 0.12 mg/ml in 5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) (ϵ280 = 1.35 for a 1 mg/ml solution; Ref. 32Lascu I. Schaertl S. Wang C.

CD spectra were recorded at 5 °C in a quartz cuvette with a 0.1-cm path-length. CD data were converted to mean residual ellipticity, assuming a hexameric structure and mean residue molecular mass of 113 Da, the latter calculated from a 152-amino acid monomer with a molecular mass of 17,180 Da (33Rosengard A.M.

Secondary structure estimates were derived from the 250-190-nm region of the recorded CD spectra using the programs CONTILL, SELCON3, and CDSSTR and their reference set of 43 proteins (34Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar) from the CDPro software package. 2lamar.colostate/edu~sreeram/CDPro/main.html. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Gel Filtration—HTP-purified wild-type or mutant forms of NM23-H1 were loaded on a Shodex gel filtration HPLC column (Shodex Protein KW-800, Showa Denko) pre-equilibrated in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 m KCl. Molecular masses of NM23-H1 were estimated relative to a standard curve generated with a commercially available molecular mass standards kit (Sigma) containing cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), and blue dextran (2,000 kDa). NM23-H1 and DNA Cleavage Activity Coelute following Gel Filtration HPLC—DNA cleaving activity co-purifies with NM23-H1 following a three-step protocol consisting of ammonium sulfate precipitation and sequential chromatographic steps of DEAE-Sephacel and hydroxylapatite (Fig. 1A; Ref. 23Ma D.

When NM23-H1-containing fractions were incubated with a 5′-end labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotide corresponding to the noncoding strand of the 5′-SHS silencer (5′-SHS antisense strand, or 5′-SHSas) from the PDGF-A gene (31Liu B. Maul R.S. Kaetzel Jr., D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26281-26290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), progressively smaller fragments were obtained with increasing amounts of protein. Oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates employed in this study are summarized in Tables I and II. This DNA cleavage pattern strongly suggested that NM23-H1 was excising nucleotides progressively from the 3′ terminus of this single-stranded DNA molecule, consistent with a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. To rule out further the possibility that the 3′-5′ exonuclease-like activity was catalyzed by nuclease contamination from the E. coli expression host, the peak fraction of NM23-H1 from the hydroxylapatite column (82-83 min) was further analyzed by gel filtration HPLC. Two peaks of NM23-H1 protein were observed (Fig. 2, top), a primary peak at approximately 18.8 min with an estimated molecular mass of 82 kDa (Table III) and a minor peak of an (∼200 kDa) aggregate. No peaks corresponding to monomeric or dimeric NM23-H1 were observed. The derived molecular mass estimate of 82 kDa is somewhat less than the predicted molecular mass of 105-120 kDa reported for hexameric NM23-H1 and NM23-H2, based on a monomeric molecular mass of 17-19 kDa (35Schaertl S.

This difference could be the result of anomalous interactions with the gel filtration matrix, as has been observed by others. 3I. Lascu, personal communication. It should also be noted that tetrameric structures have been reported for NM23-H2 based on gel filtration analysis, as well as for Myxococcus xanthus NDPK by direct assessment of the crystal structure (36Webb P.A.

Nevertheless, DNA cleavage activity (Fig. 2, bottom) coeluted precisely with the primary peak of oligomerized NM23-H1 protein (middle), providing additional evidence that the activity is not because of copurifying or nonspecifically associated nuclease contaminants.Table IIDNA substrates used in this study1 Asterisk denotes the presence of 32P at the 5′ - or 3′ -terminus of the listed oligodeoxyribonucleotides, as identified in representations under the DNA substrate column.

Elution times of the molecular mass standards (Sigma) cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (160 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), and blue dextran (2000 kDa) are indicated with arrows in the top panel. The primary peak of wild-type NM23-H1 protein as indicated by A280 was observed at 18.76 min. Fifty-μl fractions were collected and a 6-μl aliquot from each fraction was analyzed by either SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining (middle, ∼2 μg in peak fraction) or DNA cleavage assay (bottom, ∼1 μg in peak fraction). Indicated above the middle and bottom panels are the elution times of the fractions analyzed, with each number representing the beginning of the collection interval. Cleavage assays were conducted with 10 fmol of 32P-labeled 5′-SHSas probe in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 and 100 mm KCl at room temperature for 1 h. Cleavage products were separated on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by phosphorimaging.

For each chimera/mutant construct two overlapping PCR fragments were generated and combined by a second round of PCR (18Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. Stockton, New York1989: 61-70Crossref Google Scholar). The mutants were constructed using mutagenic PCR primers. The cDNA constructs were sequenced and expressed in CHO cells as described previously (19Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I. McIntyre P.

A schematic representation of chimeric constructs and point mutations used in this study are shown in Fig. 2A. Measurement of Intracellular Calcium Levels, [Ca2+]i—Ratiometric measurements of fluorescence in cells loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura 2 were carried out as previously described (10Savidge J. Davis C. Shah K. Colley S. Phillips E. Ranasinghe S. Winter J. Kotsonis P. Rang H. McIntyre P. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 43: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) using a Flexstation (Molecular Devices). Stock solutions of agonists were made up at 2 or 3 times final concentration in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) buffer and 1% Me2SO to ensure they remained in solution and they were then added to each well containing HBSS to achieve the final concentration. Fluorescence emission was measured at 5 s intervals over 1 min with alternate excitation at 340 and 380 nm. The mean of the fluorescence ratio of the last six readings after injection minus the basal ratio was used for plotting concentration-response curves. IC50 values for capsazepine were measured using EC50 concentrations of agonist determined for each species and mutant of TRPV1. Application of all the vanilloid agonists, pH 5.5 or capsazepine was without effect on the untransfected CHO cells. Electrophysiology—Voltage clamp recordings were made in the whole cell configuration as described (19Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I.

Patch pipettes (2–5MΩ) were filled with (in mm) 140 CsCl, 1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 MgATP pH 7.4, and cells were bathed in a solution consisting of (mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.4. For bath solution at pH 5.6, HEPES was replaced by 5 MES (mm). Agonist responses were evoked by rapid application of agonist-containing superfusate to the cell under study using a rapid solution changing apparatus (RSC 200, BioLogic). Recordings of agonist activity were usually made at a holding potential of –60 mV. However, the effects of capsazepine were studied using electrophysiological recording at positive membrane potentials (+80 mV) as the low pH-evoked currents showed very pronounced outward rectification, with little or no inward current at negative holding potentials. RTX Displacement Assay—RTX saturation and displacement binding were carried out as described elsewhere (20Ross R.A. Gibson T.M. Brockie H.C. Leslie M. Pashmi G. Craib S.J. Di Marzo V. Pertwee R.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Each assay point contained 40 μg of cell membrane protein. In displacement assays approximate Kd concentrations of [3H]RTX estimated for each construct were used. Data were analyzed using Origin (Microcal) and fitted to either a one- or-two-site binding model. Ki was calculated using the Cheng-Prussoff equation, Ki = IC50/1 + ([[3H]RTX]/Kd). Statistics—The statistical significance of results was analyzed using Student's t test with the significance level set at p < 0.05. Materials—Capsaicin and RTX were obtained from Sigma, Capsazepine was from Tocris. Olvanil was synthesized by Glyn Hughes, Novartis Institute for Medical Sciences. PPAHV was purchased from Alexis, fura-2 AM was from Molecular Probes and [3H]RTX from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Capsazepine—10 μm capsazepine completely blocked the increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by low pH in human TRPV1-expressing cells (98.3 ± 0.4%, n = 3) and only gave minimal (5.0 ± 4.3%, n = 7) inhibition in cells expressing rat TRPV1 (Table I), see also Refs. 1McIntyre P.

Similarly, capsazepine (3 μm) inhibited the current evoked by pH 5.5 solution by 98.0 ± 0.5% (n = 6) in human TRPV1 but by only 49.4 ± 7.1% (n = 6) in rat TRPV1 (p < 0.0001 Fig. 3B). In order to examine sequence differences that could account for this species difference in capsazepine sensitivity, a number of cDNA chimeras and mutants were made by transferring regions encoding TRPV1 between the human and the rat receptors.Table ICapsazepine inhibition of pH 5.5 and capsaicin-evoked [Ca2+]i increase in human (h) and rat (r) TRPV1, rat TRPV1 triple mutant (I514M, V518L, M547L) and rat/human TRPV1 chimerasCapsazepine inhibition channel constructpH 5.5 responsepH 5.5 responseCapsaicin responseIC50 nm% inhibitionIC50 nmrTRPV1>10,0005.0 ± 4.3463 ± 12hTRPV1120 ± 1098.3 ± 0.493.7 ± 2.4I514M,V518L,M547L924 ± 24181.2 ± 6.197.8 ± 7.9Chimera A288 ± 1892.1 ± 3.0Chimera B786 ± 1484.0 ± 2.0Chimera C>10,0006.8 ± 1.0Chimera D1090 ± 17571.5 ± 3.6Chimera E398 ± 2792.4 ± 3.6Chimera F860 ± 24668.3 ± 7.3 Open table in a new tab Initially the rat TRPV1 sequence from the end of S2 to the stop codon was replaced with sequence encoding the human TRPV1 sequence (chimera A, Fig. 2A). This construct showed near complete inhibition by capsazepine (92.1 ± 3.0%, n = 3) with an IC50 of 288 ± 18 nm (Table I), indicating that most of the species specific determinants were located in this large region. Next, the region between S2 and the end of S6 was replaced with the equivalent human TRPV1 sequence (chimera B, Fig. 2A). Chimera B displayed a phenotype more like the human than the rat TRPV1, in that 10 μm capsazepine inhibited the pH 5.5 evoked increase in [Ca2+]i by 84.0 ± 2.0% (n = 3). Chimera C, containing the human TRPV1 sequences between S4 and the end of S6 retained a rat TRPV1-like phenotype change with only 6.8 ± 1.0% (n = 3) inhibition by 10 μm capsazepine (Table I). In contrast, chimera D, in which the rat TRPV1 sequence encoding the region between S2 and the end of S4 was replaced with the human TRPV1 sequence, showed a marked capsazepine sensitivity and 10 μm capsazepine produced 71.5 ± 3.6% inhibition (n = 4). The phenotype switch seen with chimeras A, B, and D, combined with the lack of effect of the changes in chimera C strongly indicated that differences in capsazepine sensitivity were mainly due to residues from the region between the end of S2 and the end of S4. Alignment of this region revealed 9 amino acid differences between human and rat TRPV1 (Fig. 2B). The residues in this region were mutated individually or in combination. Focusing on the differences between the end of S2 and S4, we found that double mutations of the rat TRPV1 at L503M, S505T V525A, S526T, and Q533, R534L and the single mutation V518L, showed no significant capsazepine inhibition of the low pH [Ca2+]i (IC50 » 10 μm, data not shown). In contrast, mutations I514 M and M547L both conferred significant capsazepine inhibition with ∼50 and 20% reduction in the low pH evoked [Ca2+]i responses, respectively. Combining I514M with M547L increased the degree of inhibition to 70%. However, this construct gave rise to an unstable cell line with low levels of TRPV1 expression and it was not possible to obtain accurate quantitative concentration-response relationships. We found that addition of V518L improved the stability of the cell line and increased TRPV1 expression levels. Capsazepine inhibition of the proton evoked responses of the I514M, V518L, and M547L “triple mutant” construct were shown in [Ca2+]i and electrophysiological experiments. 10 μm capsazepine inhibited the [Ca2+]i increase in the triple mutant by 81.2 ± 6.1% (n = 3) compared with the 5.0 ± 4.3% inhibition in wild-type rat TRPV1 and the 98.3 ± 0.4% inhibition seen in human TRPV1 (Table I and Fig. 3A). Similarly, electrophysiological experiments showed that the triple mutant had increased capsazepine sensitivity. 3 μm capsazepine inhibited the low pH evoked current by 87.3 ± 5.4% (n = 11) compared with the control values of 49.4 ± 7.1% (p < 0.0001) for rat TRPV1 and 98.0 ± 0.5% for human TRPV1 (p = 0.02, Fig. 3B). The IC50 for capsazepine inhibition was higher for the triple mutant (I514M, V518L, M547L; 924 ± 241 nm, n = 3) than for human TRPV1 (120 ± 10 nm, n = 3; p = 0.029), suggesting the existence of further minor species-specific determinants for capsazepine sensitivity elsewhere in the ion channel. The differences in IC50 responses seen for chimeras A (288 ± 18 nm, n = 3) and B (786 ± 14 nm, n = 3) suggest that a minor determinant resides in the carboxyl terminal cytoplasmic tail. We next constructed chimeras to look at the possible effect of the S1 and S2 regions. Chimera E contained human TRPV1 sequence encoding S1 through S2 as well as I514M, V518L, and M547L mutations. Capsazepine blocked the low pH response in this construct fully with an IC50 of 398 ± 27 nm (n = 4, Table I). Chimera F contained human S2 encoding sequence as well as I514M, V518L, and M547L mutations and this construct did not confer any further inhibition, indicating that the S1 region also contains a minor determinant. Capsaicin was equipotent as an agonist at the triple mutant and rat TRPV1 with EC50 values of 6.20 ± 0.42 nm (n = 3) and 7.68 ± 0.98 nm (n = 4) and was less potent at human TRPV1 with an EC50 of 129 ± 31 nm (n = 4). We also investigated the ability of capsazepine to inhibit the capsaicin evoked response of the triple mutant. The IC50 value for capsazepine inhibition of capsaicin [Ca2+]i responses at human TRPV1 (93.7 ± 24 nm, n = 3) was about five times lower than for rat TRPV1 (463 ± 12 nm, n = 3). The rat triple mutant showed an IC50 value (97.8 ± 7.9 nm, n = 3) which is lower than the value for rat TRPV1 (p < 0.0001) and similar to the value for human TRPV1 (93.7 ± 2.4 nm, p = 0.65, Fig. 3C). RTX Binding—Saturation [3H]RTX binding was compared at rat TRPV1 and the rat triple mutant. The Kd value for the rat triple mutant (1.19 ± 0.12 nm, n = 3) was significantly larger (p = 0.0009) than the Kd value for rat TRPV1 (0.08 ± 0.02 nm, n = 3) and similar to the values for the human TRPV1 of about 1 nm, reported elsewhere (13Seabrook G.R. Sutton K.G. Jarolimek W. Hollingworth G.J. Teague S. Webb J. Clark N. Boyce S. Kerby J. Ali Z. Chou M. Middleton R. Kaczorowski G. Jones A.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 2002; 303: 1052-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We also analyzed the rat M547L mutant for RTX binding and found that the single mutation alone significantly reduced affinity for RTX (Kd 2.53 ± 0.75 nm, p = 0.04, n = 4). Capsazepine displaced [3H]RTX binding to the triple mutant completely at 20 μm with a Ki of 2.19 ± 0.43 μm (n = 3) similar to the estimated Ki of 3.91 ± 0.30 μm (n = 3) for rat TRPV1. Capsazepine inhibition of the RTX responses of the triple mutant and wild-type rat TRPV1 was also studied in the fura-2 assay. The EC50 for RTX agonism was 2.14 ± 0.21 nm (n = 3) in the triple mutant and 2.95 ± 0.61 nm (n = 7) in rat TRPV1. The IC50 values for capsazepine inhibition were 97.2 ± 10.8 nm (n = 4) for the triple mutant and 985 ± 66 nm (n = 3) for rat TRPV1 (p = 0.0001). PPAHV—The phorbol ester PPAHV is known to be an agonist at rat TRPV1 (4Szallasi A. Acs G. Cravotto G. Blumberg P.M. Lundberg J.M. Appendino G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 299: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) but does not significantly activate human TRPV1 expressed in CHO cells (1McIntyre P. McLatchie L.M. Chambers A. Phillips E. Clarke M. Savidge J. Toms C. Peacock M. Shah K. Winter J. Weerasakera N. Webb M. Rang H.P. Bevan S. James I.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and this was confirmed in the current study. PPAHV produced a concentration-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i (EC50 157 ± 12 nm, n = 3, Fig. 4A) and evoked large inward currents (Fig. 4B) in rat TRPV1 expressing cells, but did not activate human TRPV1 at concentrations up to 10 μm (Fig. 4, C and D). Analysis of concentration-response curves for [Ca2+]i response showed that chimera B was about 20-fold less sensitive to PPAHV than wild-type rat TRPV1 with EC50 values of 3.34 ± 0.13 μm (n = 3). Chimera D encoding human TRPV1 protein sequence between the ends of S2 and S4, showed a reduced sensitivity to PPAHV (EC50 value of 2.83 ± 0.53 μm, n = 3). In contrast chimera C, which has the S5, pore and S6 region substituted with sequence from the human TRPV1 sequence, showed rat TRPV1-like PPAHV sensitivity (EC50 381 ± 13 nm, n = 3). These results again pointed to the importance of residues between S2 and the end of S4 for PPAHV activation. Analysis of mutants with amino acid differences in this region showed that mutation M547L on its own, altered PPAHV sensitivity. The substitution of this residue in rat TRPV1 with the corresponding leucine in the human TRPV1 significantly reduced the sensitivity to PPAHV resulting in a 20-fold increase in the EC50 from 157 ± 12 nm for rat TRPV1 to 3.08 ± 0.15 μm (n = 4) for the M547L mutant (Fig. 4A, p = 0.0016). This mutation also reduced the amplitude of currents evoked by 1 μm PPAHV (Fig. 4B). However, even more striking was the observation that the reciprocal mutation L547M in human TRPV1 conferred sensitivity to PPAHV. In cells expressing the human L547M mutant, PPAHV evoked inward currents (Fig. 4D) and caused an increase in the [Ca2+]i with an EC50 of 1.44 ± 0.18 μm (n = 4, Fig. 4C). The rat TRPV1 M547L mutation and the human TRPV1 reciprocal L547M mutation, had no significant effects on the activation by the agonists capsaicin, RTX and olvanil (see Table II). The EC50 values for each agonist were similar for the wild type and the M547L mutant rat TRPV1 and for wild type and the L547M mutant human TRPV1.Table IIThe EC50 values of capsaicin, PPAHV, RTX and olvanil at the rat and human TRPV1 and single point mutant channels expressed in CHO cellsChannel constructAgonist EC50 ± S.E.CapsaicinPPAHVRTXOlvanilnmrTRPV17.68 ± 0.98157 ± 122.95 ± 0.616.71 ± 1.32rM547L5.68 ± 0.323081 ± 1512.39 ± 0.536.17 ± 0.35hTRPV1129 ± 31>10,00029.6 ± 7.433.2 ± 8.0hL547M163 ± 261439 ± 17534.4 ± 8.157.3 ± 12.8 Open table in a new tab We have previously shown that human and guinea pig TRPV1 show similar sensitivities to PPAHV and capsazepine (10Savidge J. Davis C. Shah K. Colley S. Phillips E. Ranasinghe S. Winter J. Kotsonis P. Rang H. McIntyre P. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 43: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In order to confirm further the role of Met-547 in conferring PPAHV sensitivity to TRPV1, we mutated leucine 549 in guinea pig TRPV1 (the equivalent position to Met-547 in rat TRPV1) to methionine (L549M). PPAHV at 10 μm produced a small [Ca2+]i response (EC50 >10 μm) in the wild-type guinea pig TRPV1 and a small inward current compared with rat TRPV1. However, cells expressing the guinea pig TRPV1 with the L549M point mutation responded to PPAHV with a large increase in both inward current (Fig. 4F) and [Ca2+]i (EC50 577 ± 68 nm, n = 3, Fig. 4E). In contrast to the differential effects of PPAHV, the EC50 value for capsaicin was similar at wild-type guinea pig TRPV1 and the L549M mutant (57.0 ± 5.3 and 33.3 ± 2.9 nm, n = 3). PPAHV Displacement of RTX Binding—Saturation [3H]RTX binding and its displacement by PPAHV was compared at rat TRPV1 and rat mutant M547L. As noted above, the Kd for M547L was significantly higher than for rat TRPV1 (2.53 ± 0.75 and 0.08 ± 0.02 nm, p = 0.04). A similar partial binding displacement of [H3]RTX by 10 μm PPAHV was noted for wild-type and M547L mutant rat TRPV1 (31.3 ± 6.5%, n = 3, for the M547L mutant and 33.1 ± 6.6%, n = 3, for rat TRPV1). Several studies have noted species differences in the action of agonists and antagonists at TRPV1 (1McIntyre P. McLatchie L.M. Chambers A. Phillips E. Clarke M. Savidge J. Toms C. Peacock M. Shah K.

In the present study, we have used a chimeric receptor and site-directed mutagenesis approach to identify the amino acid residues and regions that confer differential sensitivity to capsazepine and PPAHV. We focused our studies on the S3 and S4 regions which our rat/human TRPV1 chimera studies showed to be responsible for the major functional differences and where there were relatively few amino acid differences. Replacing the sequence encoding two amino acids in the S3 domain and one amino acid in the S4 domain of rat TRPV1 with the corresponding sequence from human TRPV1 (I514M, V518L, M547L) greatly increased the ability of capsazepine to inhibit low pH evoked membrane currents and [Ca2+]i responses. In cells expressing rat TRPV1 we noted incomplete inhibition by capsazepine of both membrane current and increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by pH 5.5. There was, however, a quantitative difference in the ability of capsazepine to inhibit the current or the rise in [Ca2+]i in that the current was reduced by about 50% by 3 μm capsazepine and this translated into a small (5%) reduction in the [Ca2+]i response. The reason for this difference is unclear but may reflect the sensitivity of the two recording methods. The relationship between membrane current and [Ca2+]i may be non-linear since the former is measuring total ion flux and the latter is measuring Ca2+ influx and intra cellular calcium release. A second difference is that the ion current across the membrane is measured under voltage clamp conditions at +80 mV whereas the [Ca2+]i is measured at near-neutral membrane potentials found in unclamped in CHO cells. Capsazepine has been reported to inhibit the low pH evoked responses or currents of rat TRPV1 receptors, native or recombinant, to a varying degree ranging from no effect to complete inhibition (1McIntyre P.

The reasons for these differences are not understood but probably reflect differences in the cellular background and the assay conditions used. The species difference between the capsazepine sensitivity of rat and human TRPV1 was also reflected in the ability of the antagonist to inhibit capsaicin and RTX responses. The IC50 value for capsazepine at rat TRPV1 with capsaicin as the agonist (463 ± 12 nm) was reduced to (97.8 ± 7.9 nm) by the triple mutation, a value close to that seen for human TRPV1 (93.7 ± 2.4 nm). Similarly the IC50 value for capsazepine with RTX as the agonist was reduced by about 10-fold by the triple mutation to 97.2 ± 10.8 nm from 985 ± 66 nm measured for rat TRPV1. However, the rat M547L mutation only affected the ability of rat TRPV1 to respond to PPAHV, not capsaicin, RTX or olvanil. Thus, by deduction, residue 514 (in the presence of V518L and M547L) interacts with the ligands capsaicin, RTX and capsazepine in a similar manner and site 547 is additionally involved in proton inhibition of TRPV1 by capsazepine and is important for the agonist activity of PPAHV without the influence of residues in S3. The S5 to S6 region contains the putative pore region with amino acid sites which have been shown to be important for capsaicin activation and for proton potentiation and activation (24Welch J.M. Simon S.A. Reinhart P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13889-13894Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 25Jordt S. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Substitution of this region between rat and human TRPV1 did not affect the pattern of capsazepine inhibition. This indicates that this region is not involved in the species-specific effects of capsazepine on low pH activation, although it does not exclude the possibility that capsazepine may interact with this region. We deduced that minor components residing in the C-terminal tail and in S1 influence the ability of capsazepine to inhibit low pH activation of TRPV1. We did not identify the relevant residues in this region due to the relatively small size of the effect, however, other studies have shown that amino acids in the N- and C-terminal tails can affect capsaicin binding and function (26Jung J. Lee S.Y. Hwang S.W. Cho H. Shin J. Kang Y.S. Kim S. Oh U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44448-44454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 27Vlachova V. Teisinger J. Suankova K. Lyfenko A. Ettrich R. Vyklicky L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1340-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rat TRPV1 mutation experiments described above show that amino acids at positions 514 and 547 are important for the ability of capsazepine to block the low pH activation of TRPV1 whereas the substitution V518L appears to be important in combination with these mutations primarily to obtain good expression of the channel. The effect of the mutated amino acid residues I514M and M547L on capsazepine action infer that the antagonist is interacting with residues that are predicted by the usual channel topology models to be on opposing sides of the cell membrane. The recent x-ray analysis of the KvAP potassium channel structure has altered the way the topology of voltage gated channels potassium is viewed (28Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). TRP channels, although ligand-gated channels, have a similar six hydrophobic domain structure to voltage activated potassium channels and may have a similar topology. If this is the case, then the location of the putative binding sites identified in our study will have to be re-considered. Although S3 and S4 segments will still run anti-parallel to each other in the KvAP model of rat TRPV1, residues 514 and 547 could be close to each other and interact. We speculate that capsazepine may act as a molecular caliper interacting with these residues in the capsazepine-blocked receptor complex and that they are therefore less than 16 A apart, if antagonist binding occurs within one subunit. PPAHV—The mutation M547L in rat TRPV1 resulted in a pronounced reduction in the ability of rat TRPV1 to respond to the agonist PPAHV, increasing the EC50 by a factor of 20. However, the most dramatic change was observed in human TRPV1, where the L547M mutation conferred PPAHV sensitivity demonstrated by the appearance of evoked membrane currents and robust [Ca2+]i responses (EC50 1.44 μm). Additional evidence for a role of this amino acid position was obtained by mutation of the guinea pig TRPV1. PPAHV is a weak agonist at guinea pig TRPV1 where 10 μm evokes only 20% of the [Ca2+]i response seen with 1 μm capsaicin and 10 μm PPAHV evoked only small inward currents. Mutation L549M in guinea pig TRPV1 increased the maximum [Ca2+]i response to PPAHV, decreased the EC50 by more than 10-fold and increased the amplitude of the PPAHV-evoked currents. These data strongly suggest that methionine in this position is important for PPAHV activation of TRPV1. In contrast to the effects on PPAHV agonism, the expression of methionine or leucine residue at 547 did not significantly affect the ability of the agonists capsaicin, RTX, or olvanil to activate rat or human TRPV1. In general, EC50 values for TRPV1 agonists are 5–20-fold higher at the human TRPV1 than at rat TRPV1 and, apart from the effect on PPAHV, neither the single mutation at position 547 nor the triple rat mutation (I514M, V518L, M547L) had any effect on these sensitivities. There is significant structural similarity between RTX and PPAHV (Fig. 1), and the vanilloid portion of both molecules is exactly the same, so species-specific effects must reside in the phorbol region. The displacement of [3H]RTX binding by 10 μm PPAHV at both rat TRPV1 and the M547L mutant was only partial (30%) and did not show significant differences. A similar incomplete displacement of [3H]RTX binding to rat DRG membranes by 10 μm PPAHV has been reported previously (4Szallasi A. Acs G. Cravotto G. Blumberg P.M. Lundberg J.M. Appendino G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 299: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). RTX binding clearly involves sites other than Met-547. In addition to sites of interaction in S2-S3 (29Jordt S.E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), sites in the cytosolic tails are essential for RTX binding (26Jung J. Lee S.Y. Hwang S.W. Cho H. Shin J. Kang Y.S. Kim S. Oh U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44448-44454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), while mutations of sites in S6 of rat TRPV1 (30Kuzhikandathil E.V. Wang H. Szabo T. Morozova N. Blumberg P.M. Oxford G.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8697-8706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to reduce [3H]RTX binding affinity significantly. Our studies have identified two amino acids (514 in S3 and 547 in S4) that influence the ability of capsazepine to antagonize the responses to low pH, capsaicin and RTX. The effects were more pronounced for low pH activation than for the vanilloid agonists. One of these residues (547) is also important for PPAHV agonism but does not influence the sensitivity to other vanilloid agonists. These residues may form part of the ligand recognition site, however the effects on individual ligands are variably influenced by these conservative amino acid substitutions. The chemical properties of leucine, isoleucine and methionine are generally similar, arguing that the species differences observed are due to steric hindrance of PPAHV and capsazepine binding. Position 514 is adjacent to two residues (511 and 512) important for capsaicin sensitivity and channel function and it has been suggested by Jordt et al. (29Jordt S.E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) that lipophilic residues in S3, like those identified in our study, may interact with the hydrophobic regions of vanilloid ligands in the plane of the membrane. Our results show that residue 547 in the S4 hydrophobic domain also contributes to ligand recognition or transduction. Although there appear to be sites throughout TRPV1 that can influence channel activity, it seems likely that the residues in S2, S3, and S4 are key for ligand recognition while others may serve a more modulatory function.

https://openalex.org/W2031034652,"The Hop/Sti1 co-chaperone binds to both Hsp70 and Hsp90. Biochemical and co-crystallographic studies have suggested that the EEVD-containing C terminus of Hsp70 or Hsp90 binds specifically to one of the Hop tetratricopeptide repeat domains, TPR1 or TPR2a, respectively. Mutational analyses of Hsp70 and Hop were undertaken to better characterize interactions between the C terminus of Hsp70 and Hop domains. Surprisingly, truncation of EEVD plus as many as 34 additional amino acids from the Hsp70 C terminus did not reduce the ability of Hsp70 mutants to co-immunoprecipitate with Hop, although further truncation eliminated Hop binding. Hop point mutations targeting a carboxylate clamp position in TPR1 disrupted Hsp70 binding, as was expected; however, similar point mutations in TPR2a or TPR2b also inhibited Hsp70 binding in some settings. Using a yeast-based in vivo assay for Hop function, wild type Hop and TPR2b mutants could fully complement deletion of Sti1p; TPR1 and TPR2a point mutants could partially restore activity. Conformations of Hop and Hop mutants were probed by limited proteolysis. The TPR1 mutant digested in a similar manner to wild type; however, TPR2a and TPR2b mutants each displayed greater resistance to chymotryptic digestion. All point mutants retained an ability to dimerize, and none appeared to be grossly misfolded. These results raise questions about current models for Hop/Hsp70 interaction.

Native interactions of the major molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90 with known client proteins typically involve several attendant co-chaperone proteins. Among the activities attributed to partner co-chaperones are regulation of chaperone ATPase activity or nucleotide exchange (1Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2003; 3: 301-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 2Mayer M.P. Brehmer D. Gassler C.S. Bukau B. Adv.

Galigniana M.D. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A commonly studied chaperone/client system is the assembly pathway for steroid receptor complexes in which multiple chaperones and co-chaperones participate in a multistep, dynamic assembly process (6Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 7Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). The co-chaperone Hop, which can bind both Hsp70 and Hsp90, plays a key role in recruiting Hsp90 to preexisting receptor-Hsp70 complexes (3Chen S. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 8Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the Hsp-binding co-chaperones most often contain a single TPR domain, Hop contains three distinct TPR domains. The C-terminal region of cytoplasmic forms of Hsp70 and Hsp90, both of which terminate with the amino acid sequence EEVD, have been implicated as the binding sites for Hop and for some other TPR co-chaperones (12Carrello A.

Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar); however, some TPR co-chaperones clearly interact with other Hsp regions (15Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 16Prapapanich V. Chen S. Toran E.J. Rimerman R.A. Smith D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6200-6207Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since Hop contains multiple TPR domains, the opportunity exists for Hop to simultaneously bind the EEVD sites of both Hsp70 and Hsp90.In a major advance toward understanding how TPR domains interface with the Hsp EEVD region, co-crystal structures were obtained for either of two Hop TPR domains complexed with an EEVD-containing peptide (14Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). One co-crystal contained the N-terminal TPR domain of Hop, TPR1, and the octapeptide GPTIEEVD that corresponds to the Hsp70 C terminus. The other co-crystal contained one of the central TPR domains, TPR2a, in complex with the pentapeptide MEEVD that corresponds to the C-terminal sequence of Hsp90. Similar to some other reported TPR domains, both of the Hop TPR domains consisted of an antiparallel α-helical stack that forms a large groove along one surface of the domain. The EEVD-containing peptides lodged within this groove but in distinct orientations that related to TPR side-chain differences within the groove and unique amino acids in either peptide. In both co-crystal structures, basic TPR side chains within the groove formed salt bridges with acidic peptide side chains, forming what was termed the carboxylate clamp. Consistent with the TPR2a co-crystal structure, point mutation of a conserved carboxylate clamp position in any of several Hsp90-binding TPR co-chaperones has been shown to disrupt Hsp90 binding (13Russell L.C. Whitt S.R. Chen M.S. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20060-20063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).The co-crystal results suggest a straightforward model for an Hsp70-Hop-Hsp90 complex in which the C terminus of Hsp70 binds TPR1 of Hop and the C terminus of Hsp90 binds TPR2a of Hop. However, experimental results suggest that additional Hop domains influence Hsp binding. For instance, mutations within the C-terminal DP-domain of Hop greatly inhibit Hsp70 binding (3Chen S. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 17Nelson G.M. Huffman H. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and deletions within TPR2b, the third TPR domain of Hop, can reduce Hsp90 binding (18Chen S. Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as shown below, truncation of the EEVD from Hsp70 had little effect on Hop binding. To help resolve relevant interactions between full-length proteins, we have taken advantage of crystallographic structures and recent insight from sequence comparisons between Hop regions to design novel Hop point mutants that were assessed for Hsp binding, support of steroid receptor function in vivo, and conformational changes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Mutagenesis and Construction of Expression Plasmids—A series of Hsp70 C-terminal truncation mutants was generated by introducing stop codons into the rat Hsc70 cDNA. Mutant cDNAs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™ kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the in vitro expression plasmid rat Hsc70/pSPUTK as template. The following mutants were generated, named according to the final amino acid encoded: N642, N614, N608, N604, N595, N575, N534, and N425.Hop point mutations were generated in a similar manner using human Hop/pSPUTK as template. Mutations in the following domains were generated: TPR1, Y27A, K73E, and K73A; TPR2a, K301E, K301A, R305E, and R305A; TPR2b, K429E, K429A, R433E, and R433A; DP1, D140A and D149A; AP1, D140A/D149A. A mutant in the DP2 domain (AP2) was constructed previously (3Chen S. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Sequences for mutagenic primers are available on request. All mutant cDNA sequences were verified by automated sequencing.For bacterial expression of recombinant proteins, mutant and wild type cDNA were cloned into pET28 for expression of untagged proteins in bacteria, pET30 for expression of His-tagged proteins, and pGEX-5X-3 for expression of GST-tagged proteins. When mutagenesis or PCR products were employed for subcloning, all insert sequences were verified by automated sequencing.In Vitro Binding Assays—Radiolabeled Hsp70 or Hop forms were generated by in vitro expression (TNT Kit; Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine. A 5-μl aliquot of each synthesis reaction was separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography; the labeled products were quantitated by densitometry (Fluor-S Multi-Imager; Bio-Rad). Molar equivalents of each radiolabeled product were added to rabbit reticulocyte lysate (1:1 lysate, Green Hectares, Oregon, WI) for immunoprecipitation and receptor assembly trials. Mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for Hop (F5), Hsp70 (BB70), or Hsp90 (H90-10) were preadsorbed to protein G-Sepharose (1 μg of antibody/μl of packed resin). For each immunoprecipitation reaction, 100 μl of reticulocyte lysate (RL) supplemented with a radiolabeled product were added to a 10-μl immunoresin pellet. The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with brief vortexing every 5 min. Resin-bound complexes were washed four times in 1 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20), resuspended in 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were Coomassie-stained to visualize total proteins and then dried and autoradiographed to visualize bound radiolabeled proteins.Comparisons of wild type and mutated Hop forms assembling with PR complexes were performed as described previously (3Chen S. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant chicken PR was immunopurified from Sf9 insect cell extracts using monoclonal antibody PR22 preadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose. Each assembly reaction contained 10 μl of PR resin (representing 1 μg of PR) and an equimolar amount of a radiolabeled Hop form in 200 μl of RL (supplemented with an ATP-regenerating system to promote assembly reactions and 20 μg/ml geldanamycin to favor recovery of intermediate PR complexes containing Hop). Samples were incubated 30 min at 30 °C with brief vortexing at 5-min intervals to resuspend resin. Resin-bound complexes were washed three times in 1 ml of wash buffer, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue followed by autoradiography of dried gels. Bands on x-ray film were quantitated by densitometry.Yeast Strains and Plasmids—All Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were generated in the W303a background (MATa leu2-112 ura3-1 trp1-1 his3-11,15 ade2-1 can1-100 GAL SUC2). Plasmids were introduced into yeast using the lithium acetate/polyethylene gycol protocol. Two to four independent transformants of each construction were analyzed. Strains were propagated in selective media consisting of 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% (w/v) glucose, the appropriate synthetic complete supplement mixture (Q-biogene, Carlsbad, CA), and 1.6% (w/v) agar for plates.To generate the Sti1-minus yeast strain (sti1Δ0), the entire coding region of STI1 was replaced with the Schizosaccharomyces pombe HIS5 gene flanked by loxP sites; the His marker was subsequently removed by transformation with a plasmid encoding the Cre recombinase (19Gueldener U. Heinisch J. Koehler G.J. Voss D. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e23Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Gene deletion was confirmed by yeast colony PCR, and the absence of Sti1p was confirmed by Western blot analysis with the anti-Sti1 monoclonal antibody ST2 (provided by D. Toft).As described previously (20Riggs D.L. Roberts P.J. Chirillo S.C. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Ratajczak T. Gaber R. Picard D. Smith D.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression strain contained a pG/N795 plasmid constitutively expressing rat GR and the GRE-lacZ reporter plasmid pUCΔSS-26X. Wild type or mutant Hop cDNA was introduced into a yeast expression vector by ligating a HindIII/EcoRV fragment from pSPUTK into the constitutive expression plasmid p425GPD, which contains a LEU2 nutritional marker, a 2μ origin of replication, and a constitutive GPD transcriptional promoter.Yeast Assays for Hormone-induced Reporter Gene Expression—Hormone induction assays were conducted as previously described (20Riggs D.L. Roberts P.J. Chirillo S.C. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Ratajczak T. Gaber R. Picard D. Smith D.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast strains were grown in selective media at 25 °C to an A600 of 0.05–0.12 units. Growth was monitored by spectrophotometry for 30 min before hormone addition to ensure that the culture was in exponential phase. Deoxycorticosterone (DOC) was added to the culture at 50 nm final concentration. To assay for β-galactosidase activity, 100 μl of culture was withdrawn and immediately added to 100 μl of the Gal-Screen™ substrate (Tropix, Bedford, MA) in 96-well microtiter plates at room temperature. Samples were taken at 10-min intervals until 70–80 min after hormone addition. The plate was read in a luminometer 2 h after the last sample was collected.To determine the rate of reporter expression, β-galactosidase induction curves were first generated by plotting relative light units against the A600 of the culture sample. Regression analysis of the linear portion of each data set yielded a best fit line (typically R2 > 0.98) whose slope is the growth-normalized rate of β-galactosidase expression.Yeast Cell Extracts and Western Immunoblots—To prepare whole cell extracts, washed cell pellets were resuspended in cracking buffer (8Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholarm urea, 5% (w/v) SDS, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.04% (w/v) bromphenol blue) at 4 ml/g of cells. Cells were homogenized with glass beads in a Mini Bead Beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). Cell homogenates were centrifuged to remove insoluble material and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Lysate aliquots (10–15 μl) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunostained for Sti1p (mouse monoclonal IgG ST-2), Hop (mouse monoclonal IgG F5), or the yeast ribosomal protein L3 (mouse monoclonal IgG anti-L3).Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—BL21 bacterial cells were transformed with each of the various expression plasmids for protein expression. Briefly, 1 liter of LB medium plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated 1:100 with an overnight culture of transformed bacteria. Cells were grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.5, at which time 100 mm isopropyl β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. Cells were incubated for an additional 3 h at room temperature. Bacterial cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol plus Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and sonicated to generate cell extracts.His-tagged proteins were purified by metal affinity chromatography according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiaexpressionist Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Extracts were applied to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Resins were washed three times in 1 ml wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole). Protein was eluted at 250 mm imidazole.GST-tagged bacterial extracts were rocked batch-wise with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins were eluted from the glutathione resin with 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 10 mm reduced glutathione.Untagged Hop forms were purified by three-step chromatography (Akta FPLC, Amersham Biosciences). First, bacterial extracts containing untagged proteins were loaded on a HiPrep16/10 Heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer A, and proteins were eluted with a salt gradient of 0–0.5 m KCl in buffer A. Peak fractions containing Hop were identified by gel electrophoresis and pooled. For the next purification step, samples were loaded on a Resource Q column and eluted with 0–500 mm KCl. Peak fractions were again pooled and then applied to a 16/60 Superdex 200 column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. Final peak fractions for Hop were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Centricon-10 filters (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). The purity of all Hop forms was judged to be greater than 95%.GST-Hop Pull-down Assays—Previously purified and quantitated GST-tagged Hop forms were incubated batch-wise with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (5 μg of protein plus 20 μl of bed volume resin) for 30 min at room temperature on a rocking platform and washed three times in 1 ml of incubation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Resin pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of incubation buffer plus 10 μg of purified Hsp70 for 30 min at 30 °C. Resin was subsequently washed three times in 1 ml of ice-cold incubation buffer containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, separated on gels, and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining.Protease Digestion of Recombinant Hop Forms—Purified His-tagged Hop forms were subjected to partial proteolytic analysis (21Konigsberg W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using chymotrypsin (Type VIII; Sigma) or subtilisin Carlsberg (Type VIII; Sigma). Digestion mixtures containing 30 μg of Hop and 300 ng of protease in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (60-μl total volume) were incubated at 30 °C over a 60-min time course with the removal of 10-μl aliquots at 1, 5, 15, and 60 min. Proteolysis was quenched by the addition of 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and/or by placing the sample in an acetone/dry ice bath. Protein fragments were separated on precast 4–20% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and Coomassie-stained to visualize protease digestion patterns. Bands were quantitated by densitometry.RESULTSKnown structural/functional domains of Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hop are illustrated in Fig. 1A. Hsp90 contains an N-terminal ATPase domain (22Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), a large middle domain (23Meyer P. Prodromou C. Hu B. Vaughan C. Roe S.M. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal region of unknown conformation that contains a strong dimerization site. There is evidence for peptide binding by both the ATPase and middle domains of Hsp90 (24Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Hsp70 contains an N-terminal ATPase domain (25Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) unrelated to the corresponding Hsp90 domain, a central peptide binding domain (26Morshauser R.C. Hu W. Wang H. Pang Y. Flynn G.C. Zuiderweg E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1387-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal 10-kDa domain (27Chou C.C. Forouhar F. Yeh Y.H. Shr H.L. Wang C. Hsiao C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30311-30316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Hop contains three TPR domains plus a C-terminal DP domain and a putative central DP domain (further described below). As indicated, TPR1 is thought to bind the C-terminal PTIEEVD sequence of Hsp70, whereas Hop TPR2a is thought to bind the C-terminal MEEVD sequence of Hsp90 (14Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G.

The TPR motifs in antiparallel α-helices form the peptide binding groove. Positively charged side chains of Arg305 and Lys301 that form the TPR2a carboxylate clamp are highlighted, as are the negatively charged side chains of the MEEVD peptide. The TPR1/GPTIEEVD co-crystal shows a similar overall structure, although the carboxylate clamp residues and peptide side chains are oriented in a unique manner.Hsp70 C-terminal Sequences Necessary for Hop Binding—To test directly which C-terminal sequences of Hsp70 are required for Hop binding, a series of C-terminal truncation mutants was prepared (Fig. 2A), and each mutant was compared with full-length Hsp70 in a Hop co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 2B). The smallest truncation (N642) lacks the terminal EEVD site, the next truncation (N614) lacks sequences through the GGMP-repeat region (dashed underlined region), and additional mutants progressively remove upstream highly conserved sequence patches (solid underlined regions). Equivalent amounts of radio-labeled Hsp70 forms were added to rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and the Hsp90-Hop-Hsp70 complex was immunoprecipitated using an anti-Hop antibody. Proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie staining (Fig. 2B, top panel) or autoradiography (middle panel). The amounts of radio-labeled Hsp70 added to each mixture are shown in an additional autoradiograph (bottom panel).Fig. 2Interaction of Hsp70 C-terminal truncation mutants with Hop.A, shown is the amino acid sequence for the C-terminal region (positions 587–646) of rat Hsc70 (PIR accession number P08109). The highlighted sequences are regions of highest conservation among Hsp70 forms (solid underline), the GGMP repeat motif that is found in some Hsp70 family members (dashed underline), and the octapeptide (boldface letters) used for co-crystallization with Hop TPR1. Stop codons were introduced in this region to generate a series of truncation mutants, as indicated. B, wild-type (WT) and mutant cDNA were used to generate radiolabeled protein products. Molar equivalents of each Hsp70 form (Input) were added to normal rabbit reticulocyte lysate, from which Hop complexes were immunoprecipitated. Immune complexes were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie staining for total proteins (top panel) or by autoradiography to detect bound radiolabeled Hsp70 forms (middle panel). Stained bands, which represent rabbit Hsp90 and Hsp70 that co-precipitate with Hop and the anti-Hop heavy chain (HC), are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Contrary to expectations, truncation of the C-terminal EEVD (N642) or more extensive truncations (N614 and N608) had little effect on recovery of Hsp70 in Hop complexes. Only when the final 40–50 amino acids were truncated (N604 and N595) was there a major loss of Hop binding. An additional truncation mutant that terminates at position 575 also failed to bind Hsp70 (not shown), thus minimizing the likelihood that N604 and N595 artifactually block Hop access to upstream binding sites. On the other hand, in probing the region from 590 to 606 that contains sequences necessary for Hop binding, several single and double point mutations were generated, but none of these inhibited Hop binding (not shown). Point mutant results argue against the presence of a discrete Hop binding site in this region. Although this limited mutational analysis does not identify sequences in the C-terminal region of Hsp70 that are sufficient for Hop binding, we can conclude that the EEVD and adjacent GGMP repeat region are not required for Hop binding in our assay.Mutagenic Analysis of Hop Domains—To further explore Hop/Hsp70 interactions, we generated domain-specific point mutants of Hop to verify that TPR1 is required and to test whether other Hop domains participate in Hsp70 binding. Careful sequence analysis of Hop revealed a previously overlooked symmetry between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of Hop. Fig. 3 shows an alignment of TPR1 plus downstream sequences compared with TPR2b and downstream sequences. We have previously shown that sequences downstream from TPR2b contain a DP-repeat motif (underlined sites) that contributes to an independent structural domain (17Nelson G.M. Huffman H. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Truncation or point mutations within the so-called DP domain lessens binding of Hop to Hsp70 without affecting Hop binding to Hsp90. As the alignment in Fig. 3 reveals, there is similarity between the C-terminal DP domain and sequences correspondingly positioned downstream from TPR1. We refer to this recently recognized N-terminal DP region as DP1 and the original DP domain as DP2.Fig. 3Sequence similarity between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of Hop. In the alignment of amino acids 6–187 with 362–539 of human Hop (PIR accession number A38093), regions of similarity are observed between TPR1 and TPR2b (shaded box); the carboxylate clamp positions targeted for mutagenesis are indicated (bold-face type and underlined). The latter portion of each sequence contains a DP repeat motif (open box); the various DP elements are indicated (boldface type), as are residues targeted for mutagenesis (underlined). Alignments were generated using the Gap component of SeqWeb (version 2.1; Accelrys).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Point mutants were generated for each of the three TPR domains as well as the two DP regions. Within the TPR domains, point mutations targeted basic residues in the carboxylate clamp. For TPR2b, whose structure has not been solved, basic amino acids corresponding to the carboxylate clamp positions in TPR1 were mutated (double underlines in Fig. 3). In other Hsp90-binding TPR proteins, point mutations of basic amino acids that form the carboxylate clamp have been shown to efficiently disrupt Hsp90 binding (13Russell L.C. Whitt S.R. Chen M.S.

AceCS2 is highly expressed in the skeletal muscle and is robustly induced by fasting. Quantification of AceCS2 transcripts both in C2C12 and human myotubes indicated that fasting-induced AceCS2 gene expression appears to be independent on insulin action. Characterization of 5′-flanking region of the mouse AceCS2 gene demonstrates that Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) plays a key role in the trans-activation of the AceCS2 gene. Deletion and mutation analyses of AceCS2 promoter region revealed that the most proximal KLF site is a curtail site for the trans-activation of the AceCS2 gene by KLF15. Using Sp-null Drosophila SL2 cells, we showed that the combination of KLF15 and Sp1 resulted in a synergistic activation of the AceCS2 promoter. Mutation analyses of three GC-boxes in the AceCS2 promoter indicated that the GC-box, located 8 bases downstream of the most proximal KLF15 site, is the most important GC-box in the synergistic trans-activation of the AceCS2 gene by KLF15 and Sp1. GST pull-down assays showed that KLF15 interacts with Sp1 in vitro. Quantification of various KLF transcripts revealed that 48 h fasting robustly induced the KLF15 transcripts in the skeletal muscle. Together with the trans-activation of the AceCS2 promoter, it is suggested that fasting-induced AceCS2 expression is largely contributed by KLF15. Furthermore, KLF15 overexpression induced the levels of AceCS2 transcripts both in myoblasts and in myotubes, indicating that AceCS2 gene expression in vivo is indeed induced by KLF15.

Acetyl-CoA is an important intermediate in various metabolic pathways including fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis and the energy production by the citric acid cycle. There are several enzymes that generate acetyl-CoA in the mammals, including pyruvate dehydrogenase, which converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA without generating free acetate. The degradation of fatty acid via β-oxidation system also produces acetyl-CoA as an end product. Although acetate is not an essential source of acetyl-CoA in animals, the enzymatic ligation for the production of acetyl-CoA from acetate and CoA is a key reaction in the catabolism of acetate formed by several conditions including bacterial fermentation in the colon, oxidation of ingested ethanol in the liver. Acetyl-CoA synthetase (AceCS, 1The abbreviations used are: AceCS, acetyl coenzyme A synthetase; AFX, ALL1-fused gene from X chromosome; CMV, cytomegalovirus; FKHR, forkhead box O1a; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GLUT4, glucose transporter 4; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HSkMC, human skeletal muscle cell; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; KLF, Krüppel-like factor; MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor 2; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA end; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GFP, green fluorescent protein. EC 6.2.1.1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the production of acetyl-CoA from acetate and CoA. In particular, this enzyme plays a key role in the nervous system for recycling of acetate released by acetylcholine esterase for the formation and release of acetylcholine in cholinergic nerve terminals. There are two AceCSs with similar enzymatic properties in mammals: one designated AceCS1 is a cytosolic enzyme and the other, designated AceCS2, is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme (1Fujino T. Kondo J. Ishikawa M. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11420-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Localized in the cytoplasm, AceCS1 provides acetyl-CoA for the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol. In contrast, AceCS2 produces acetyl-CoA for oxidation through the citric acid cycle to produce ATP and CO2 in the mitochondrial matrix. AceCS1 is a member of a family of genes whose transcription is regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor that activates multiple genes for cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism (2Luong A. Hannah V.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26458-26466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 3Ikeda Y. Yamamoto J. Okamura M. Fujino T. Takahashi S.

The levels of AceCS1 mRNA was induced when cultured cells were deprived of sterols and negatively regulated by sterol addition. In our previous study, we have shown that the AceCS1 promoter region consists of multiple clustered SREBP binding sites and immediately downstream from this region there is a cluster of multiple GC-boxes (3Ikeda Y. Yamamoto J. Okamura M. Fujino T. Takahashi S. Takeuchi K. Osborne T.F. Yamamoto T.T. Ito S. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34259-34269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All these SREBP binding sites are bound with purified SREBP-1a and are required for a maximal response to co-transfected SREBP. The sterol regulation of the AceCS1 gene was critically dependent on three closely spaced SREBP binding sites and an adjacent GC-box. We also showed that SREBP synergistically activated the AceCS1 promoter along with Sp1 or Sp3 but not with nuclear factor Y (NF-Y). AceCS2 is highly expressed in the cardiac and skeletal muscle and its regulation is completely different from that of AceCS1. A marked induction of AceCS2 mRNA is seen in the heart and skeletal muscle when animals are fasted (1Fujino T. Kondo J. Ishikawa M. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11420-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The levels of AceCS2 mRNA in the skeletal muscle of Zucker diabetic fatty rats were also increased compared with those in the normal littermates. These data indicated that the AceCS2 transcripts are induced in the heart and skeletal muscle under ketogenic conditions including prolonged fasting and diabetes. During fasting, the expression of more than 94% of genes is not altered in the skeletal muscle. Among genes that are differentially expressed during fasting, genes involved in protein breakdown (components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway), fatty acid oxidation, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) that suppresses glucose oxidation by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity, are up-regulated (4Jagoe R.T. Lecker S.H. Gomes M. Goldberg A.L. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1697-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 5Pilegaard H. Saltin B. Neufer P.D. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast, genes encoding glycolytic enzymes are down-regulated by fasting. Induction of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation is also seen in the skeletal muscle of diabetic mice (6Yechoor V.K. Patti M.-E. Saccone R. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10587-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although these changes indicate a complex adaptive program for sparing glucose, the mechanism underlining transcriptional regulation is not fully understood. To define the mechanism of transcriptional induction of AceCS2 by fasting, we isolated and characterized 5′-flanking region of the mouse AceCS2 gene. In this article, we describe that fasting induced transcriptional activation of the AceCS2 gene in the skeletal muscle is largely contributed by a unique transcription factor, KLF15, a Krüppel-like factor. Our current data indicate a unique role of KLF15 in the activation of genes induced by prolonged fasting.

Suske (Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany). pPac-based plasmid encoding rat KLF15 was generated by inserting the KLF15 cDNA into the pPac vector. An Sp1-GST fusion construct, pGEX-Sp1, was prepared by inserting the Sp1 cDNA fragment into the XhoI site of pGEX-4T-2. Cloning of 5′-Flanking Region of Mouse AceCS2 Gene—The 5′-flanking region of the mouse AceCS2 gene was cloned by PCR using Mouse Genome Walker kits (Clontech) as described previously (3Ikeda Y. Yamamoto J. Okamura M. Fujino T. Takahashi S. Takeuchi K. Osborne T.F. Yamamoto T.T. Ito S. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34259-34269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, the first PCR was conducted with adaptor primer 1 (provided by the supplier) and AceCS2 primer 1 (5′-TGACCACCCCGATTGTCCAGAG-3′) on a mouse genomic library (provided by the supplier). Nested PCR was then carried out with adaptor primer 2 (provided by the supplier) and AceCS2 primer 2 (5′-CGCAGCAGTCGCCCCACACCGCTGC-3′) on the first PCR products. The resulting 2.4-kb PCR product was subcloned into the pGEM-T easy cloning vector (Promega) to create pGEM-5′FL-AceCS2. Sequencing of the insert of pGEM-5′FL-AceCS2 was performed in both directions by the PCR cycle sequence method with an automatic sequence analyzer (Beckman Coulter CEQ 2000XL DNA Analysis System). Rapid Amplification of cDNA End (RACE)—5′-RACE was performed using GeneRacer™ Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 750 ng of poly(A)+ RNA from quadriceps muscles of fasted mice was first treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove the 5′-phosphates. This eliminates truncated mRNA and non-mRNA from subsequent ligation with the GeneRacer™ RNA Oligo. The dephosphorylated RNA was then treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove the 5′ cap structure from intact, full-length mRNA, and was ligated with 0.25 μg of the GeneRacer™ RNA Oligo using T4 RNA ligase at 37 °C for 1 h. The resulting products were then hybridized with random hexamer, reverse transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase, and subjected to PCR with a primer specific for the RNA Oligo (5′-CGACTGGAGCACGAGGACACTGA-3′) and an AceCS2 specific antisense primer (5′-CTGCACATGCTGATCCAGGCAGTTGA-3′). PCR parameters were 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles. A major product of ∼400 bp was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen): eleven clones were isolated for sequencing analysis. AceCS2 Promoter-Reporter Constructs—pAceCS2(2347) is the mouse AceCS2 promoter-luciferase reporter gene that spans –2347 to–1 relative to translation initiation site. pAceCS2(1928), pAceCS2(1528), pAceCS2(1383), pAceCS2 (940), pAceCS2 (654), pAceCS2 (110), and pAceCS2 (77), are 5′-deletion mutants of pAceCS2(2347), each contains a deletion with the 5′-end denoted in each parentheses and the same 3′-end point at –1. pAceCS2(2347) was constructed by PCR of pGEM-5′FL-AceCS2 using a forward primer starting from –2347 and a reverse primer OGY3as (5′-CTCGCCCGACGCCCCACGCG-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the SmaI site of pGL3 basic. pAceCS2(1928), pAceCS2(1528), pAceCS2(1383), pAceCS2 (940), pAceCS2 (654), pAce-CS2 (110), and pAceCS2 (77) were constructed in a similar manner to pAceCS2(2347) using respective forward primers starting from the position –1928, –1528, –1383, –940, –654, –110, and –77, respectively, and coupled with a common reverse primer OGY3as. Base substitution mutants were generated in pAceCS2(1928) and pAceCS2 (654) using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Oligonucleotides designed to mutate each element were as follows: the KLF site at –91, GGGTGGTG → GCTGCAGG; GC-box A at –132, AGGGCAGGC → AGACTAGTC; GC-box B at –76, GGGGCGGAG → GGAATTCAG; and GC-box C at –65, GGGGCGGGG → GGATATCGG. Cells, Cell Culture, and Transfection—HEK293 cells (a line of human embryonic kidney cells) and C2C12 cells (a line of mouse myogenic cells) were obtained from Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research at Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan). HSkMC (human skeletal muscle cells isolated from limbal skeletal muscle) were purchased from CELL APPLICATIONS, Inc. (San Diego, CA). HEK293 cells were maintained in medium A (DMEM containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) at 37 °Cin5%CO2. C2C12 cells and HSkMC were maintained in medium A and differentiated into myotubes in medium B (DMEM containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate and 2% horse serum) for 5 days. Schneider line 2 (SL2) cells, an Sp-null Drosophila cell line, were purchased from Invitrogen, maintained in Schneider's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and grown at 23 °C. HEK293 and SL2 cells were transfected in 24-well plates using LipofectAMINE PLUS as described previously (15Sakai J. Rawson R.B. Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Seegmiller A.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). After 24 h, the cells were lysed with 0.1 ml of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega), and aliquots were used for the measurement of firefly and Renilla luciferase activities as described below. C2C12 cells were transfected exactly by the same method as that for HEK293 cells, except that the medium was switched to the differentiation medium (medium B) at 24 h post-transfection. After an additional incubation for 48 h, the cells were lysed and subjected to firefly and Renilla luciferase assays. Enzyme Assays—Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Luciferase activities were determined in a Berthold Lumat Flash & Glow LB 955 luminometer. Firefly luciferase activities (relative light unit) were normalized by Renilla luciferase activities (relative light unit). For SL2 cells, β-galactosidase activities were determined using Luminescent β-galactosidase Reporter System (Clontech) and luciferase activities were normalized by the β-galactosidase activities (relative light unit). Retroviral Vectors and Infection—The plat-E retroviral packaging cell line (16Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Therap. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar), and the retroviral vector pWZL containing the blasticidin S resistance gene were, respectively, provided by Drs. T. Kitamura (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) and G. P. Nolan (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). KLF15 cDNA was subcloned into the retrovirus vector, pWZL, to generate pWZL-KLF15. To generate C2C12 cells stably expressing KLF15, the cells were infected with the retroviral vectors pWZL-KLF15 as described by Pear et al. (17Pear W. Nolan G. Scott M. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: Plat-E packaging cells were infected with plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, cells were refed with fresh medium and cultured for an additional 24 h to obtain retroviral supernatants. For retroviral infection, C2C12 cells (50∼60% confluence) were incubated with retroviral supernatants in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene for 24 h. Cells expressing KLF15 were selected for resistance to blasticidin S hydrochloride (10 μg/ml, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and maintained in medium A. C2C12 cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were generated using a retrovirus vector encoding GFP (pWZL-GFP) and designated as C2C12/GFP. Animal Manipulation—Male ICR mice were purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc (Tokyo, Japan). The mice were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled (26.5 °C and 35%, respectively) facility with a 12 h light/dark cycle (dark cycle was between 20.00–8.00). Mice were allowed to free access of water and a normal chow diet (CE-2, CLEA Japan) before experiments. Mice (7–8 weeks of age) were randomly divided into two groups: one group was fed ad libitum with regular diet and the other group was fasted for 48 h. All mice were sacrificed at the same time between 9.00 and11.00 AM. Quadriceps muscles were removed, weighed, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until RNA was extracted. Quantitative Real Time PCR—First strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA and oligo(dT) primers using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. Specific primers for each gene transcript (listed in Table I) were designed using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Real time PCR contained, in a final volume of 20 μl, 3.125 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA, 167 nm of each primer, and 10 μl of 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (catalog no. 4309155; Applied Biosystems).

Complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides –70 to –105 were annealed and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled probe was incubated with 10 μg of nuclear extracts in a binding buffer containing 22.5 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 2.6 mm MgCl2, 13.3% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.125 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml poly(dI-dC) for 30 min at room temperature. For competition experiments, excess (100-fold) unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to the binding mixture. In the supershift experiment, an antibody for KLF15 (2.5 μg) was added to the binding reaction. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (3Ikeda Y. Yamamoto J. Okamura M. Fujino T. Takahashi S. Takeuchi K. Osborne T.F.

GST Pull-down Analysis—35S-labeled KLF15 was synthesized in vitro using pCMV-KLF15, TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega) and l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. GST-Sp1 fusion protein was synthesized by the GST Gene Fusion System (Amersham Biosciences) and purified by the Bulk GST Purification Module (Amersham Biosciences). GST-Sp1 fusion protein and GST expressed in E. coli DH5α were isolated by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The immobilized GST protein beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 35S-labeled KLF15 at 4 °C for 1 h in the binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). The beads were washed seven times with the same buffer, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Effects of Insulin on Levels of AceCS2 Transcripts in Skeletal Muscle—We previously showed that fasting robustly increases the levels of AceCS2 mRNA in the skeletal muscle. There are several known fasting-inducible genes that are negatively regulated by insulin (19O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). These include genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (20Hall R.K. Yamasaki T. Kucera T. Waltner-Law M. O'Brien R. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

To determine whether insulin negatively regulates the expression of AceCS2, we used C2C12 and human myotubes. As a positive control for the insulin response in C2C12 myotubes, we have analyzed the mRNA levels of two well known insulin responsive genes, hexokinase II and PDK4: hexokinase II and PDK4 are, respectively, up- and down-regulated by insulin. Cells were incubated with or without insulin for various time periods and the levels of AceCS2, hexokinase II, and PDK4 mRNAs were determined by quantitative real time PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, insulin treatment did not alter the levels of AceCS2 mRNA, whereas those of hexokinase II and PDK4 were, respectively, induced and reduced by insulin treatment. Similarly, the levels of AceCS2 mRNA in human skeletal myotubes were not altered (Fig. 1B), suggesting that fasting-induced AceCS2 gene expression is not directly dependent on insulin action. 5′-Flanking Region of the Mouse AceCS2 Gene—To determine the mechanism regulating fasting-induced expression of the AceCS2 gene, we initially isolated and characterized the 5′-flanking region of the mouse AceCS2 gene. Approximately 2.4-kb upstream of the translation initiation ATG was isolated by PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”) and was sequenced (Fig. 2A). The transcription initiation sites were determined by 5′-RACE experiments on poly(A)+ RNA from mouse skeletal muscle using an AceCS2 transcript-specific primer (see “Experimental Procedures”). Sequence analysis of the 5′-RACE products revealed that the AceCS2 gene has multiple transcription start sites: two major points at –23 and –28 and four minor points at –12, –17, –19, and –53 (Fig. 2A); the A of the translation initiation ATG of the gene is designated +1. Trans-activation of AceCS2 Promoter by KLF15—Potential elements for various transcription factors were identified by computer-assisted search using AliBaba2.1 (www.gene-regulation.com/pub/programs/alibaba2/index.html) and TFSEARCH (www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCHJ.html).

https://openalex.org/W2021691032,"A galaxy can act as a gravitational lens, producing multiple images of a background object. Theory predicts that there should be an odd number of images produced by the lens, but hitherto almost all lensed objects have two or four images. The missing 'central' images, which should be faint and appear near the centre of the lensing galaxy, have long been sought as probes of galactic cores too distant to resolve with ordinary observations. There are five candidates for central images, but in one case the third image is not necessarily the central one, and in the others the putative central images might be foreground sources. Here we report a secure identification of a central image, based on radio observations of one of the candidates. Lens models using the central image reveal that the massive black hole at the centre of the lensing galaxy has a mass of <2 x 10(8) solar masses (M(o)), and the galaxy's surface density at the location of the central image is > 20,000M(o) pc(-2), which is in agreement with expections based on observations of galaxies that are much closer to the Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2084760062,"Bacterial resistance to antibiotics poses a serious worldwide public health problem due to the high morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases. Most hospital-onset infections are associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains that have acquired multiple drug resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. In a response to antimicrobial stress, nearly all clinical MRSA isolates produce β-lactamase (BlaZ) and a penicillin-binding protein with low affinity for β-lactam antibiotics (PBP2a, also known as PBP2′ or MecA). Both effectors are regulated by homologous signal transduction systems consisting of a sensor/transducer and a transcriptional repressor. MecI (methicillin repressor) blocks mecA but also blaZ transcription and that of itself and the co-transcribed sensor/transducer. The structure of MecI in complex with a cognate operator double-stranded DNA reveals a homodimeric arrangement with a novel C-terminal spiral staircase dimerization domain responsible for dimer integrity. Each protomer interacts with the DNA major groove through a winged helix DNA-binding domain and specifically recognizes the nucleotide sequence 5′-Gua-Thy-Ade-X-Thy-3′.

The structure of this first molecular determinant of methicillin resistance in complex with its target DNA provides insights into its regulatory mechanism and paves the way for new antimicrobial strategies against MRSA. Resistance of pathogens to chemotherapy is a natural biological phenomenon. It appeared at the very start of the antimicrobial era before antibiotics were introduced into clinical practice, as early as 1917 (1Moore H.F. Chesney A.M. Arch. Intern. Med. 1917; 19: 611-682Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 2Fleming A. Br. J. Exp. Pathol. 1929; 10: 226-236Google Scholar). Resistance is a transmissible phenomenon, facilitated by transduction, transformation, and conjugation, whose effect relies on the ability of bacteria to survive and multiply in the presence of drug concentrations at therapeutic dosages. Initially, this did not pose a serious threat to health due to the flood of available compounds and later to the development of novel semi-synthetic penicillins. Later, however, pathogens increasingly acquired resistance, sharing new molecular shields against antibiotics via plasmids, transposons, and bacteriophages. In parallel, increasing costs in drug development led the pipeline of new drugs to run dry, and the incentives to develop new antimicrobials to address the global problems of drug resistance were insufficient. The problem has now grown to such an extent that it threatens global stability and security (3WHO WHO Global Strategy for Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance, WHO/CDS/CSR/DRS/2001.2.www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/drugresist/Eglobal_Strat.pdfDate: 2001Google Scholar). Staphylococcus aureus is the most common etiological agent for community- and hospital-onset infections. It has proven a talent for acquiring resistance to β-lactam antibiotics (BLAs) 1The abbreviations used are: BLA, β-lactam antibiotic; DBD, DNA-binding domain; DD, dimerization domain; ESRF, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility; MRSA, methicillin-resistant S. aureus; PBP, penicillin-binding protein; PDB, Protein Data Bank; WH, winged-helix; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 1The abbreviations used are: BLA, β-lactam antibiotic; DBD, DNA-binding domain; DD, dimerization domain; ESRF, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility; MRSA, methicillin-resistant S. aureus; PBP, penicillin-binding protein; PDB, Protein Data Bank; WH, winged-helix; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. soon after their introduction. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) appeared less than 1 year after methicillin was brought into the clinic (4Jevons M.P. Rolinson G.N. Knox R. Br. Med. J. 1961; 1: 124-125Crossref Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). This resistance is generally accompanied by reduced sensitivity to several other BLAs, including carbapenams, monobactams, and natural and semisynthetic cephalosporins and to aminoglycosides and macrolides. This multiple drug resistance has led to the emergence of essentially untreatable strains, which show reduced susceptibility to the latest effective drugs, the glycopeptides teicoplanin and vancomycin (5Hiramatsu K. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2001; 1: 147-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Staphylococcal resistance to BLAs may be accomplished in two ways as follows: (i) by the synthesis of β-lactamase (BlaZ), capable of hydrolyzing BLA β-lactam rings and encoded by blaZ typically on plasmids; and (ii) by the production of an alternative penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a, PBP2′, or MecA) with significantly reduced affinity to BLAs, encoded by mecA on a transducible mobile element. PBPs are transpeptidase (and transglycosylase) enzymes that maintain the integrity of the bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall, and the housekeeping forms present in S. aureus are BLA-sensitive. In contrast, MecA is less sensitive to BLAs and can take over their function when they have been inactivated. However, recent observations suggest that MecA just assists the cooperatively functioning housekeeping PBP2 enzyme during cell wall synthesis (6Pinho M.G. de Lencastre H. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10886-10891Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Whatever the case, MecA contributes to the production of clinical isolates that are impervious to or less sensitive to BLAs. Its is assisted by other factors in modulating the optimized MRSA phenotype (7Berger-Bächi B. Rohrer S. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 8Katayama Y. Zhang H.Z. Hong D. Chambers H.F. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5465-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The pathways inducing MecA and BlaZ effector synthesis feature closely related signal transduction systems that are encoded by genes from the S. aureus mec and bla divergons, respectively (9Zhang H.Z. Hackbarth C.J. Chansky K.M. Chambers H.F. Science. 2001; 291: 1962-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). An evolutionary relationship exists between PBPs and β-lactamases, which supports the close relationship between the two pathways. These signal transduction systems consist of an integral membrane zinc-dependent sensor/signal transducer, MecR1 or BlaR1, and a constitutive transcriptional repressor, methicillin repressor MecI or BlaI (10Weller T.M.A. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1999; 43: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both the sensor/transducer and the repressor are located on the same operon, mecR1-mecI and blaR1-blaI, immediately upstream from the mecA and blaZ promoters, and they are counter-transcribed (4Jevons M.P. Rolinson G.N. Knox R. Br. Med. J. 1961; 1: 124-125Crossref Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, 11Hiramatsu K. Asada K. Suzuki E. Okonogi K. Yokota T.

An orthologous system consisting of a sensor/transducer, a repressor, and an effector has been described in Bacillus licheniformis, encoding the BlaR-BlaI-BlaP protein triad (also known as PenJ-PenI-PenP) (11Hiramatsu K. Asada K. Suzuki E. Okonogi K. Yokota T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13Clarke S.R. Dyke K.G. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2001; 47: 377-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MecR1 and BlaR1 are constituted by an N-terminal integral membrane metalloprotease domain (requiring activation) and a C-terminal extracellular PBP-like domain that detects BLAs. MecI and BlaI are ∼125-amino acid proteins found in several bacterial genomes (see Fig. 1) (14García-Castellanos R. Marrero A. Mallorquí-Fernández G. Potempa J. Coll M. Gomis-Rüth F.X. J. Biol.

They are dimeric and interact with cognate palindromic operators (Fig. 2A) as dimers to inhibit effector molecule transcription but also transcription of themselves and the co-transcribed sensor/transducer (13Clarke S.R.

The current working model foresees that detection of environmental BLAs by MecR1/BlaR1/BlaR triggers conformational changes that lead to (auto)activation of the metalloprotease domain which, in turn, inactivates the cognate repressor through limited proteolysis (Fig. 2, B and C). Dimer disruption, gene derepression, and effector transcription ensue. Thus, constitutive resistance to methicillin may arise through mutations inactivating MecI or down-regulating mecI transcription.Fig. 2Inverted repeat regions of bla and mec divergons recognized by BlaI/PenI, and MecI and cleavage sites attributed to MecR1/BlaR1/BlaR activity.

The purified complex was concentrated to 10.5 mg/ml by centrifugation with a Centricon-10 device. Crystallization of the MecI 25-bp DNA Complex, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Crystals were obtained from hanging drops consisting of 1 μl of complex in buffer C, 1 μl of reservoir solution (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.1 m MgCl2, 6.7% PEG 8K), and 0.6 μl of 0.1 m hexamine cobalt as an additive, after a 5-day incubation at 20 °C. A cryo-protecting protocol consisted of soaking crystals first in a harvesting buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.15 m MgCl2, 10% PEG 8K), allowing them to equilibrate for 5 min, and then in a cryo-protecting buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.15 m MgCl2, 10% PEG 8K, 30% glycerol) for one more minute prior to flash cryo-cooling in liquid N2.

Two searching models were used, a MecI dimer (PDB access code 1okr (14García-Castellanos R. Marrero A. Mallorquí-Fernández G. Potempa J. Coll M. Gomis-Rüth F.X. J. Biol.

The dimer rendered a unique solution at 43.4, 13.9, 345.2, 0.6193, 0.7117, and 0.2745 (α, β, γ, in Eulerian angles; x, y, and z, as fractional unit cell coordinates) with a correlation coefficient in structure factor amplitudes (CCF) of 52.5% and a crystallographic Rfactor of 46.4% (for definitions, see Table I and Ref. 19Navaza J.

It features protein residues Asn3-Lys122 from monomers A and B, oligonucleotides Gua1-Thy25 of chain C and Cyt1-Gua25 of chain D, one potassium cation (labeled K1W) at a special position, tentatively assigned on the base of electron density and temperature factor after refinement, and 37 solvent molecules (Hoh2W-Hoh38W). All residues are placed in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, except for Lys23 of each polypeptide, as seen in the unbound structure. These residues and their side chains are, however, well defined by electron density at the end of helices α1. Miscellaneous—Figures were prepared with programs TURBOFRODO, SETOR (22Evans S.V. J. Mol. Graphics. 1993; 11: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar), BOBSCRIPT/VOLUMES (23Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graphics. 1997; 15: 133-138Google Scholar), and GRASP (24Nicholls A. Bharadwaj R. Honig B. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: A166Google Scholar). Superimpositions were performed with TURBO-FRODO and sequence alignments with MULTALIN and ESPRIPT 2.1 (25Gouet P. Robert X. Courcelle E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3320-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar); close contacts and interaction surfaces were calculated with CNS. DNA analysis was performed with 3DNA and CURVES 5.3 (26Lavery R. Sklenar H. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1998; 6: 63-91Crossref Scopus (919) Google Scholar). The final coordinates of the MecI-DNA complex have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (PDB access code 1sax). Structure of Methicillin Repressor within the Complex—Like other transcriptional regulators, methicillin repressor forms a dimer, with the overall shape of a triangle (see Fig. 3C). Each protein monomer consists of a compact globular N-terminal DNA-binding domain, MecI-DBD (residues Met1-Val73; see Fig. 1), and a C-terminal dimerization domain, MecI-DD, with a novel fold and the shape of a spiral staircase (Fig. 3). No contacts are observed between the DBDs; the dimeric structure is entirely maintained by the DDs. The chain topology of MecIDBD is in accordance with a “winged-helix” (WH) architecture, which bears a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. The second helix, termed the “recognition helix” (helix α3 in MecI), is inserted into the DNA major groove and preceded by a positioning helix. This structural motif is followed by one or two β-hairpin wings (one in MecI), mostly engaged in minor and/or major groove interactions. The structure of MecI-DBD correlates well with that of isolated B. licheniformis BlaI-DBD, encompassing the first 82 residues (27van Melckebeke H. Vreuls C. Gans P. Filée P. Llabres G. Joris B. Simorre J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). MecI-DD starts at Glu74 and displays a right-handed superhelical ribbon made up by three consecutive helices, α4 to α6 (Fig. 3C). These are not totally equivalent within each monomer, and they are also slightly flexible, in particular around the C-terminal helix, as already noted in the unbound structure (PDB 1okr (14García-Castellanos R. Marrero A. Mallorquí-Fernández G. Potempa J. Coll M. Gomis-Rüth F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39897-39905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). This is in accordance with the observation during NMR studies of B. licheniformis BlaI that the C-terminal segment His83-Glu128 (see Fig. 1) is poorly resolved in solution (27van Melckebeke H. Vreuls C. Gans P. Filée P. Llabres G. Joris B. Simorre J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The three C-terminal helices are closely juxtaposed in MecI and intimately intertwine like two surface and side chain complementary protein superhelices. The presence of two void cavities within this DD further contributes to a certain sponginess that is likely to be important for the regulatory derepression mechanism (see below). In the present protein-DNA complex structure, both protomers display close structural similarity, as indicated by an r.m.s.d. of 0.51 Å for 116 Cα atoms deviating less than 2 Å. Merely loop α5α6 shows a noteworthy deviation of 3.6 Å (measured at Asp107 Cα), probably a crystal packing artifact and, to a certain extent, the following helix α6. On comparing this structure with the unbound protein, it is evident that the dimer is already preformed prior to dsDNA binding (Fig. 3E). The dimers are equivalent (r.m.s.d. of 0.97 Å for 208 Cα atoms deviating less than 2 Å) and mainly the wings rearrange upon operator recognition (maximum deviation 3.4 Å at Lys65A Cα and 2.5 Å at Lys65B Cα; see Fig. 3E). Besides this, loop α4α5 shows a deviation at Gly93 of 5.4 Å (molecules A) and 5.3 Å (molecules B) but with no obvious consequences for the overall structure or DNA binding. Interactions between MecI and DNA—For the present studies we chose a 24-bp dsDNA provided with a 1-bp overhang on either side (Fig. 3A). This oligonucleotide encompasses the sequence of the S. aureus bla Z dyad, recognized by MecI with similar affinity to BlaI (13Clarke S.R. Dyke K.G. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2001; 47: 377-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as this region directly affects the ribosome-binding site of blaZ and is clearly delimited. This is not the case for the reported MecI target site on mec, which shows two vicinal palindromes with only a 4-bp spacing. MecI binds promoter dsDNA through the helices α3 of each WH DBD, which are inserted into two successive turns of the major groove, and the wings, contacting the minor groove backbone. The minor groove faces the protein dimer at the center of the complex (Fig. 3C), which buries 9136 Å2, about 20% of the total protein dimer surface and one-third of the total dsDNA area. The DNA in the complex adopts a predominantly right-handed B-type nucleic acid structure. Only two short regions, Thy6D-Ade8D and Thy15D-Ade17D and their complementary bases, engaged in major contacts within the complex (see below), do not follow the regular B-DNA geometry, and display underwinding of about 10-15°. The dsDNA is bent 23°, mainly due to a kink produced by the α-helices packed into and thus spreading along the major groove. The most common type of bending observed in protein-DNA complexes is concave, and the DNA helix is smoothly curved around the bound protein. This feature increases the number of interactions and the binding strength. MecI, however, induces convex bending, with the DNA bent away from the bound protein. This type of curving is less common (28Dickerson R.E. Chiu T.K. Biopolymers. 1998; 44: 361-403Crossref Google Scholar). MecI-induced promoter bending goes along with the expansion of the minor groove (see Figs. 2A and 3). Maximum width/minimum depth values of the groove (with phosphors as the atoms defining the backbone; according to program CURVES (26Lavery R. Sklenar H. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1998; 6: 63-91Crossref Scopus (919) Google Scholar)) are reached around Ade12C (left-hand side of the operator), with 9.6/2.9 Å, and Gua18C (right-hand side), with 10.3/1.8 Å (for comparison, regular B-DNA shows values of about 6/5 Å), approximately equidistant from the center of the operator. The major grove is also larger, with maximal width and depth at Ade9C (17.6/6.7 Å) and Ade20C (16.1/6.3 Å), than regular B-DNA (11/4 Å). A detailed inspection of the complex interface on the left-hand side of the operator (see Fig. 3, C, D, and F) reveals 40 specific and unspecific contacts below 4 Å between the DBD of protein molecule A and the DNA helix (chains C and D), including 16 H-bonds and salt bridges, 10 protein/DNA backbone interactions, and nine specific base contacts. The first protein residue engaged in DNA-binding is Glu7A, which recognizes the DNA backbone. This fits well with the finding that an N-terminal deletion mutant lacking the first eight residues of B. licheniformis BlaI had lost its operator binding ability (16Wittman V. Lin H.C. Wong H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1"

To deepen understanding of the roles for EBF in this process, we have used Pearson correlation analysis to evaluate microarray data from a set of mouse B lymphoid cell lines representing different stages of development. Comparing the expression pattern of EBF to that of the other genes in the data set revealed that VpreB1, mb-1, and λ5, all known target genes, presented high correlation values to EBF. High correlations were also seen for the VpreB3 and CD19 genes and biochemical as well as functional data supported that they are target genes for EBF even though the expression of CD19 was critically dependent of Pax-5. We also obtained evidence for extensive collaborative actions of EBF and E47 even though microarray analysis of hematopoetic progenitor cells ectopically expressing these proteins suggested that they activated only a subset of pre-B cell restricted genes.

B cell development proceeds from a multipotent progenitor in the bone marrow into a highly specialized immunoglobulin secreting plasma cell. The process can be divided into several stages based on the recombination status of the immunoglobulin genes and gene expression patterns (1Ghia P. ten Boekel E. Rolink A.G. Melchers F. Immunol.

Sigvardsson M. Akerblad P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8389-8397Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), there is still a need to elucidate how they exert their biological functions to establish and promote B cell development. One possibility to obtain information about genetic programs and coordinated gene expression is by the use of microarray technology that allows for the simultaneous measurements of the expression levels of several thousand genes. We have earlier used a set of B cell lines arrested at different stages of their development to establish a crude map over gene expression patterns in B cell differentiation (22Tsopogas P. Breslin T. Bilke S. Månsson R. Lagergren A. Liberg D. Peterson C. Sigvardsson M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The analysis of control gene expression suggested that this approach allowed for a reasonable approximation of expression patterns (22Tsopogas P. Breslin T. Bilke S. Månsson R. Lagergren A. Liberg D. Peterson C. Sigvardsson M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) giving us a tool to investigate also the coordination of stage-specific gene activation. We have used part of these data to estimate the relative importance of transcription factors in the activation of the mouse mb-1 (Igα) promoter by Pearson correlation analysis (23Sigvardsson M. Clark D.R. Fitzsimmons D. Doyle M. Åkerblad P. Breslin T. Bilke S. Liu Y. Yeamans C. Zhang G. Hagman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8539-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This promoter contains binding sites for EBF, E47, BSAP, and Ets proteins (23Sigvardsson M. Clark D.R. Fitzsimmons D. Doyle M. Åkerblad P. Breslin T. Bilke S. Liu Y. Yeamans C. Zhang G. Hagman J.

Biol. 1992; 12: 1126-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and when comparing the expression levels of the mb-1 message to the levels of the transcription factors, EBF gave a 98% correlation, whereas BSAP and Ets proteins resulted in lower values (23Sigvardsson M. Clark D.R. Fitzsimmons D. Doyle M. Åkerblad P. Breslin T. Bilke S. Liu Y. Yeamans C. Zhang G. Hagman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8539-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This indicated to us that the expression of the mb-1 gene was highly dependent of EBF and that this type of analysis can provide important biological information.To increase the understanding of the role of EBF in early B cell development we decided to investigate if global Pearson correlation analysis of microarray data can be used to identify genetic targets. The expression levels of EBF displayed a high correlation with a number of known EBF target genes but also of other genes including the VpreB3 and CD19 genes. A role for EBF in the regulation of these genes could also be supported by biochemical and functional assays suggesting that correlation analysis can be used to investigate genetic networks and identify targets for transcription factors in complex biological systems.MATERIALS AND METHODSTissue Culture Conditions—All cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2mm pyruvate, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (all purchased from Invitrogen AB). The pro-B cell lines were grown in RPMI as above supplemented with 10% of interleukin-3 containing WEHI3-conditioned media. The Ba/F3 cells were kind gifts from Dr. R. Grosschedl (Gene Center, Munich).Gene Expression Analysis—RNA was prepared using Trizol (Invitrogen) and 7.5 μg of total RNA was annealed to a T7-oligo T primer by denaturation at 70 °C for 10 min followed by 10 min of incubation of the samples on ice. First strand synthesis was performed for 2 h at 42 °C using 20 units of SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) in buffers and nucleotide mixtures according to the manufacturer's instructions. This was followed by a second strand synthesis for 2 h at 16 °C, using RNase H, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, and E. coli DNA ligase (all from Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The obtained double stranded cDNA was then blunted by the addition of 20 units of T4 DNA polymerase and incubated for 5 min at 16 °C. The material was then purified by phenol:cloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction followed by precipitation with NH4Ac and ethanol. The cDNA was then used in an in vitro transcription reaction for 6 h at 37 °C using a T7 in vitro translation kit and biotin-labeled ribonucleotides. The obtained cRNA was purified from unincorporated nucleotides on an RNAeasy column (Qiagen). The eluted cRNA was then fragmented by incubation of the products for 2 h in fragmentation buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 100 mm KOAc, 150 mm MgOAc). 20 μg of the final fragmented cRNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix chip U74Av2 (Affymetrix) in 200 μl of hybridization buffer (100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.6, 1 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20) supplemented with herring sperm DNA (100 μg/ml) and acetylated bovine serum albumin (500 μg/ml) in an Affymetrix Gene Chip hybridization oven 320. The chip was then developed by the addition of fluorescein isothiocyanate-streptavidin followed by washing using an Affymetrix Gene Chip Fluidics Station 400. Scanning was performed using a Hewlett-Packard Gene Array scanner.Data Analysis—Affymetrix gene chip arrays were analyzed using the dChip software (28Li C. Wong W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar) and obtained model-based expression values (based on the PM/MM model) were exported. Standard Pearson correlation coefficients were determined for each gene versus all other genes using data from 16 different Affymetrix arrays. As a measurement of random/average correlation between genes the average number of correlations for all given values were calculated. (Process was automated and programs can be made available on request.) The slope of the fitted line, Ki, used to compare expression levels of EBF to the rest of the data set, was calculated using linear regression minimizing the sum of the square errors.Protein Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Schreiber et al. (29Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 176419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3908) Google Scholar). DNA probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by incubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science), annealed with the complementary strand and purified on a 5% polyacrylamide TBE gel. 5-10 μg of nuclear extract or 0.5-2 μl in vitro transcribed/translated protein was incubated with the labeled probe (20,000 cpm, 3 fmol) for 30 min at room temperature in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 70 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2,5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol) with 0.75 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). 1 mm ZnCl2 was added to shift assays performed in the presence of EBF. DNA competitors were added 10 min before addition of the DNA probe. The samples were separated on a 6% acrylamide TBE gel, which was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Competitors based on synthetic oligonucleotides were added at molar excesses indicated in the respective figures. Fulllength λ5, mb-1, CD19, and VpreB promoters were generated by PCR (see below) and were added at molar excesses as indicated in the respective figures.Oligonucleotides used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays were: mb-1 sense: 5′-AGCCACCTCTCAGGGGAATTGTGG; mb-1 antisense, 5′-CCACAATTCCCCTGAGAGGTGGCT; mutated mb-1 sense, 5′ AGCCACCTCTCAGCCGTTTTGTGG; mutated mb-1 antisense, 5′-CCACAAAACGGCTGAGAGGTGGCT; μE5 sense, 5′-GGCCAGAACACCTGCAGACG; μE5 antisense, 5′-CGTCTGCAGGTGTTCTGGCC; Oct binding site sense, 5′-CATCTCAAGTGATTTGCATCGCATGAGACG; Oct binding site antisense, 5′-CGTCTCATGCGATGCAAATCACTTGAGATC; CD19-BSAP sense, 5′-GCAGACACCCATGGTTGAGTGCCCTCCAGG; CD19-BSAP antisense, 5′-CCTGGAGGGCACTCAACCATGGGTGTCTGC; VpreB3 EBF site 1 sense, 5′-CTCAGTCCCACTAGGGTAGCTATT; VpreB3 EBF site 1 antisense, 5′-AATAGCTACCCTAGTGGGACTGAG; VpreB3 EBF site 2 sense, 5′-GCCTCAGTCTCCTGGGATTAACAG; VpreB3 EBF site 2 antisense, 5′-CTGTTAATCCCAGGAGACTGAGGC; VpreB3 E47 site 1 sense, 5′-AAGTGCAAGCAGGTGAAGAGAGTG; VpreB3 E47 site 1 antisense, 5′-CACTCTCTTCACCTGCTTGCACTT; VpreB3 E47 site 2 sense, 5′-TCTGAATCACAGGTGTGCCCTCCA; VpreB3 E47 site 2 antisense, 5′-TGGAGGGCACACCTGTGATTCAGA; VpreB1/2 EBF site intron sense, 5′-AAGGAAACTCTTGGGGCCCAGG; VpreB1/2 EBF site intron antisense, 5′-CCTGGGCCCCAAGAGTTTCCTT; VpreB1 E47 site 1 sense, 5′-GACGTTCCAGCAGGTGCTTCCTCCC; VpreB1 E47 site 1 antisense, 5′-GGGAGGAAGCACCTGCTGGAACGTC; VpreB1 E47 site 2 sense, 5′-GTGCTTCCCAGCTGGTCAGGGC; VpreB1 E47 site 2 antisense, 5′-GCCCTGACCAGCTGGGAAGCAC; VpreB1 E47 site 3 sense, 5′-GGGGAGAGCAGGTGCCAAGTGA; VpreB1 E47 site 3 antisense, 5′-TCACTTGGCACCTGCTCTCCCC; VpreB1 E47 site 4 sense, 5′-CCAAGTGACAGGTGTGGAGCAG; VpreB1 E47 site 4 antisense, 5′-CTGCTCCACACCTGTCACTTGG; CD19 EBF site sense, 5′-GAAGCCGGGTGCCCCAGGGAGCCTG; CD19 EBF site antisense, 5′-CAGGCTCCCTGGGGCACCCGGCTTC; CD19 E-box 1 sense, 5′-TTAACTCCACCAGCTGGGAAAC; CD19 E-box 1 antisense, 5′-GTTTCCCAGCTGGTGGAGTTAA; CD19 E-box 2 sense, 5′-AATATTTACAGGTGCCACTATG; CD19 E-box 2 antisense, 5′-CATAGTGGCACCTGTAAATATT. Promoter competitors were obtained by PCR amplifications from the pGL-3 promoter plasmids using the Gl-2 and RV3 primers (Promega).Plasmids and Constructs—The E47FD plasmid was based on the neomycin encoding eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) placing the inserted cDNA under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. The EBF encoding plasmid mediating puromycin resistance was based on the retroviral vector pBabe (30Akerblad P. Lind U. Liberg D. Bamberg K. Sigvardsson M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3640-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Retroviruses and Infection of BaF/3 Cells—The Pax-5 encoding retrovirus virus and the control virus were kind gifts from Professor Sten-Eirik Jacobsen. The viruses were based on murine stem cell virus vectors expressing BSAP and green fluorescent protein, or for the control only green fluorescent protein, as a single bicistronic transcript containing an internal ribosomal entry site. Prior to viral coating 24- well non-tissue culture plates were incubated 2 h in room temperature with retronectin (40 μg/ml, Stemcell Technologies) followed by 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin. Plates were then incubated with the viral supernatant for 1 h at tissue culture conditions (see above). 50,000 BaF3 cells were seeded into the coated wells in media supplemented with 10% viral supernatant, 6 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma), and 25 ng/ml murine IL-3 (Stemcell Technologies). Cells were incubated for 24 h before repeating the infection procedure. Day 7 after infection green fluorescent protein-positive cells were sorted on a FACS-Vantage Cell sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).Reverse Transcriptase and Polymerase Chain Reactions—RNA was prepared from cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) and cDNA was generated by annealing 1 μg of total RNA to 0.5 μg of random hexamers in 10 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Reverse transcriptase reactions were performed with 200 units of SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the manufacturer's buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm dNTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics) in a total volume of 20 μl, at 37 °C for 1 h. One-twentieth of the RT reactions were used in the PCR assays. PCR reactions were performed with 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) in the manufacturer's buffer supplemented with 0.2 mm dNTP, in a total volume of 25 μl. Primers were added to a final concentration of 1 mm.For all PCRs the program was identical with the exception of the number of cycles (Y) and the annealing temperature (XX).Annealing temperatures and cycles were: 36B4 at 57 °C for 25 cycles; λ5 at 60 °C for 32 cycles; VpreB1 at 60 °C for 32 cycles; VpreB2 at 60 °C for 32 cycles; VpreB3 at 60 °C for 32 cycles; HPRT at 50 °C for 30 cycles; and EBF at 58 °C for 35 cycles.Oligonucleotides used for RT-PCR were: 36B4, sense, 5′-GAGGAATCAGATGAGGATATGGGA and antisense, 5′-AAGCAGGCTGACTTGGTTGC; λ5, sense, 5′-TGTGAAGTTCTCCTCCTGCTC and antisense, 5′-ACCACCAAAGTACCTGGGTAG; VpreB1, sense, 5′-TGCTCATGCTGCTGCCTAT and antisense, 5′-CTCCGGAGCCCCACGGCA; VpreB2, sense, 5′-CTCATGCTGCTGGCCCAC and antisense, 5′-TTCTAGGCTCTGCAAAGCCC; VpreB3, sense, 5′-TGTGGCAGTCTTTCAGCCAACT and antisense, 5′-AATATCTCCAGCGGTGGCATG; HPRT, sense, 5′-GCTGGTGAAAAGGACCTCT-3′ and antisense, 5′-CACAGGACTAGAACACCTGC-3′; EBF, sense, 5′-GCCCGGGCTCACTTTGAGAAGCAGC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GCTTTTCTTGTCACAACAGCG-3′; CD19, sense, 5′-TACCTTAGTAGGAGGCAGGCC-3′ and antisense, 5′-ATAGTGGGGAGATGTTCCGG-3′.Q-PCR—RNA was prepared using Trizol (Invitrogen). Total RNA cleanup including DNase treatment was performed with the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed as described above (see RT and PCR). Q-PCR were performed using 2× TaqMan PCR master mixture (Applied Biosystems) and 20× assay-on-demand TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) in a total volume of 20 μl. Taq-Man probes used for Q-PCR were: CD19, Mm00515420_m1; Mb-1, Mm00432423_m1; and HPRT, Mm00446968_m1 (all from Applied Biosystems).Isolation and Purification of Bone Marrow Progenitors and Mature Peripheral B-cells—Bone marrow cells were sorted on a FACS-Vantage Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), equipped with a 488-nm argon ion (Coherent Enterprise II, Santa Clara, CA) and a 633-nm He-Ne (model 127, Spectra-Physics, Mountain View, CA) laser. Antibodies used were B220-APC, CD43-PE, IgM-biotin (streptavidin TRI), CD19-fluorescein isothiocyanate, and CD138 (Syndecan)-PE all from Pharmingen. The purity of all sorted cell populations is reproducible over 95%.RESULTSPearson Correlation Analysis Allows for the Identification of EBF Target Genes—Making the presumption that genes regulated in a similar fashion would have correlating expression patterns, we decided to attempt to define genetic targets for EBF using a data set generated from microarray analysis of 14 mouse B lineage cell lines representing different stages of development (22Tsopogas P. Breslin T. Bilke S. Månsson R. Lagergren A. Liberg D. Peterson C. Sigvardsson M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These cell lines displayed a wide spectra of EBF expression levels and the relative amount of RNA, as estimated by the microarray analysis, appeared to correlate well to the amount of EBF DNA binding activity observed using nuclear extracts from the same cell lines (data not shown). To investigate the correlations between genes in the data set and EBF, we decided to use standard Pearson correlation analysis that results in a numerical value for how well alterations in expression levels of two genes correlates. This type of analysis will generate a wide variety of correlations between different genes, so to obtain information about the levels of correlations that can be expected for any given gene, either by chance or by true correlation, we calculated the correlation values for the whole data set, i.e. ∼156 million correlations. We then plotted the average number of correlations ≥X (X being the Pearson correlation values between -1 to +1) found for all the genes in the data set (Fig. 1). This shows that any given gene in average only displays a correlation ≥0.9 to three other genes, i.e. about 1 in 4000. Thus, Pearson correlation values above or around 0.9 would only rarely be seen as random events and could therefore indicate a biologically relevant link. To investigate if we would be able to use this approach to define target genes for EBF we performed the same analysis focusing on the correlations obtained between genes within the data set and EBF. The number of correlating genes were plotted into a diagram and compared with the average numbers previously calculated (Fig. 1). The analysis suggested that EBF expression correlated significantly better with a set of genes than what would be expected for an average gene. Fifteen genes were found to correlate with a value >0.9 and another 15 with a value above 0.85, as compared with the predicted value of around 9. Investigating the identity of these highly correlated mRNAs revealed that they included λ5, VpreB1, and mb-1 transcripts, all suggested EBF target genes (5Hagman J. Belanger C. Travis A. Turck C.W. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 760-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 31Sigvardsson M. O'Riordan M. Grosschedl R. Immunity. 1997; 7: 25-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This shows that from the 12,000 genes we were able to mathematically extract 3 of 6 known/suggested EBF target genes among the top 15 (0.12%). The other proposed EBF targets B29 (33Akerblad P. Rosberg M. Leanderson T. Sigvardsson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), Blk (34Akerblad P. Sigvardsson M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5453-5461PubMed Google Scholar), and BSAP (35O'Riordan M. Grosschedl R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) were found to display a correlation of 0.81, 0.26, and 0.56, respectively, suggesting that the expression of these genes is not closely linked to the expression of EBF in this data set.Fig. 1EBF displays higher correlation with a set of genes than expected from random events. The diagram displays a standard curve of Pearson correlation values generated by analysis of all possible correlations in the data set (filled line) with standard deviation indicated. The diagram indicates the number of genes (y axis) with correlations above a given value (y axis). The small graph indicates the complete distribution of correlation values in the data set, whereas the first large panel displays the distribution of positive correlation values. The red line indicates the values obtained by comparing the correlation of EBF with all the genes in the data set. The second large graph shows a zoom on the region with the highest correlation values are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further investigate the highly correlated genes we postulated that to be a genuine genetic target there should be a high dependence of EBF for the expression of the potential target gene. That is, a doubling in EBF expression levels should result in at least a doubling of target gene expression. Thus, by plotting the expression value of genes displaying a high Pearson correlation with EBF toward the levels of EBF we should obtain a graph with a rather steep slope (high Ki). Calculating the Ki value for all the genes in the data set and blotting the correlation values on the x axis and the Ki values on the y axis (Fig. 2, Table I), it became apparent that the majority of the genes that displayed a high Ki were found in the group with a high Pearson correlation value. Among these were λ5, VpreB1, mb-1, VpreB3, IgM, and CD19 (Fig. 2). This indicates that all the known EBF target genes with high correlations displayed a high dependence of EBF, whereas some other highly correlated genes did not. One gene that fulfilled the criteria for being a potentially new EBF target was the VpreB3 gene (36Shirasawa T. Ohnishi K. Hagiwara S. Shigemoto K. Takebe Y. Rajewsky K. Takemori T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1827-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The expression of this gene has not been extensively studied so to investigate the expression pattern in primary bone marrow B cells we sorted B220+, CD43+, IgM-pro-B cells, B220+, CD19+, IgM-pre-B cells, B220+, IgM+, CD19+ B cells, and CD19-Syndecan+ plasma cells and performed RT-PCR analysis of the RNA content of these cells (Fig. 3). EBF was expressed at the highest level in the pre-B cell population, whereas some expression was detected also among the B and plasma cell populations. The peak of expression of λ5 and VpreB3 was also observed at the pre-B cell stage but while the λ5 message only could be detected in the pre-B cells, VpreB3 expression followed that of EBF also in primary cells. Thus, our mathematical analysis of microarray data suggests that the expression levels of a limited but well defined set of genes are correlated to the expression of EBF in B cell development.Fig. 2Genes with a high dependence of EBF can be identified by estimation of the graphical slope. The figure displays the Pearson correlation values for EBF against the whole data set on the x axis and the obtained slope constant (Ki) on the y axis as indicated. The obtained values from all genes in the data set are displayed as individual dots and some suggested or potential EBF target genes are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IThe table presents the genes showing the highest Pearson correlation with EBF according to the expression patterns as assessed by microarray analysisPearson correlation valueKi valueGene annotation0.980.80SRY-box containing gene 4 (Sox-4)0.984.34Pre-B lymphocyte gene 3 (VpreB3)0.970.78SRY-box containing gene 4 (Sox-4)0.965.75Pre-B lymphocyte gene 1 (VpreB1)0.952.20Sorting nexin 20.941.30Epithelial membrane pr"

Herein we show that LFA-1 induces a potent and transient increase in the activity of the small GTPase Rac-1 in T cells. Maximal Rac-1 activity peaked 10–15 min after LFA-1 stimulation and rapidly declined to basal levels at longer times. We have identified Vav, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac-1, and PI3K/Akt, as regulators of the activation and inactivation phases of the activity of Rac-1, respectively, in the context of LFA-1 signaling based on the following experimental evidence: (i) LFA-1 induced activation of Vav and PI3K/Akt with kinetics consistent with a regulatory role for these molecules on Rac-1, (ii) overexpression of a constitutively active Vav mutant induces activation of Rac independently of LFA-1 stimulation whereas overexpression of a dominant-negative Vav mutant blocks LFA-1-mediated Rac activation, (iii) pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/Akt prevented the fall in the activity of Rac-1 after its initial activation but had no effect on Vav activity, and (iv) overexpression of a dominant-negative or a constitutively active Akt-1 induced or inhibited, respectively, Rac-1 activity. Finally, we show that T cells with a sustained Rac activity have impaired capacity to elongate onto ICAM-1. These results demonstrate that down-regulation of the activity of this GTPase is a requirement for the regulation of T cell morphology and motility and highlight the importance of temporal regulation of the signaling triggered from this integrin.

T lymphocytes are primarily circulating cells in the vascular system until they sense signals that trigger their adhesion to endothelial cells and their migration across the endothelial monolayer into the subendothelial tissue. Acquisition of a polarized phenotype by T lymphocytes is an essential feature that is required for crucial functions performed by these cells, including extravasation, oriented migration toward inflammatory sites, and interaction with antigen presenting cells during antigen recognition (1Sanchez-Madrid F. del Pozo M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 2Serrador J.M.

Resting T lymphocytes express an inactive form of the integrin LFA-1 with low affinity/avidity for its ligands. However, leukocyte activation through different cell surface receptors, including the T cell receptor·CD3 complex and receptors for cytokines and chemokines, results in activation of LFA-1 molecules (6Campbell J.J.

Activation of LFA-1 molecules can also be induced from outside the cells by different protocols, including (i) induction of integrin clustering following cross-linking with a secondary antibody, (ii) altering the extracellular divalent cation conditions, i.e. by addition of micromolar concentrations of Mn2+ (9Dransfield I.

For integrin LFA-1 in particular, the intracellular signals that are generated in T cells following ligand engagement of this receptor have not been fully characterized. It has been described that LFA-1 signaling includes phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1, phospholipid hydrolysis, activation of different isoenzymes of protein kinase C, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, and activation of tyrosine kinases (12Petruzzelli L.

Three classes of PI3Ks have been defined based on their structure and subunit composition, substrate specificity, and regulatory mechanisms. Class I PI3Ks are the best characterized in leukocytes. The lipid products of class I PI3Ks are involved in the coordination of a set of events leading to cell growth, cell cycle entry, cell migration, and cell survival, through the targeting of numerous cytosolic proteins that contain domains that specifically bind to D-3 phosphorylated phosphoinositides. The fungal metabolite wortmannin and the pharmacological compound LY294002 are two potent inhibitors of class I PI3Ks that have been used extensively to study the physiological role of class I PI3Ks in various cellular responses. Through the use of these inhibitors, class I PI3Ks have been shown to play an important role in the control of chemotactic peptide- and chemokine-induced polarization and cytoskeletal organization in leukocytes (20Vicente-Manzanares M. Rey M. Jones D.R. Sancho D. Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. del Pozo M.A. Yanez-Mo M. de Ana A.M. Martinez A.C. Merida I. Sanchez-Madrid F. J.

The serine-threonine kinase Akt-1 is a major target of PI3K that plays a role in protecting many cell types from apoptosis and in promoting cell survival (22Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4596) Google Scholar, 23Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Recently, the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway has also been involved in the control of neutrophil chemotaxis (24Heit B. Tavener S. Raharjo E. Kubes P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Akt-1 is activated by phosphorylation by the kinase PDK-1, following binding through its pleckstrin homology domain to the PI3K lipid products on the plasma membrane.Members of the Rho subfamily of small GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, play crucial roles in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization in many cell types, including leukocytes (25Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar, 27Symons M. Settleman J.

The Rho family member Rac-1 has been shown to be essential for cytoskeletal changes and spreading, polarization and chemotaxis of different leukocyte populations on fibronectin and other ligands for β1 integrins (30D'Souza-Schorey C. Boettner B. Van Aelst L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3936-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 31del Pozo M.A. Vicente-Manzanares M. Tejedor R. Serrador J.M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J.

These proteins cycle between a GDP-bound state (inactive) and a GTP-bound (active) state that is able to interact and activate their downstream signaling effectors. The intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho family GTPases is potentiated by GTPase-activating proteins that therefore favor the inactive state (GDP-bound) of these GTPases whereas guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) induce the release of GDP and binding of new GTP. Vav is 95-kDa multidomain protein that works as a key GEF for Rac GTPases in hematopoietic cells. In T lymphocytes Vav is involved in the T cell receptor signaling that leads to activation of Rac-1 and cytoskeletal rearrangements (34Fischer K.D. Kong Y.Y. Nishina H. Tedford K. Marengere L.E. Kozieradzki I. Sasaki T. Starr M. Chan G. Gardener S. Nghiem M.P. Bouchard D. Barbacid M. Bernstein A. Penninger J.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 554-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vav guanine exchange activity is primarily regulated through phosphorylation by different intracellular tyrosine kinases of the Src and Syk families although binding of Vav through its pleckstrin homology domain to phosphoinositide products of PI3K may represent an additional level of regulation of the activity of this GEF (35Han J.

In this paper, we show that following LFA-1 activation and ligand engagement in T lymphocytes the Rho family member Rac-1 is transiently activated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LFA-1 induces activation of Vav and PI3K/Akt, which in turn regulate the activation and inactivation of Rac-1, respectively. By transfecting T cells with constitutively active mutant forms of Vav and Rac-1 and through pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/Akt-1 we show that the inactivation of Rac-1 is necessary for the processes of T cell polarization and motility mediated by LFA-1.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Human T lymphoblasts were prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by treatment with 10 μg/ml phytohemag-glutinin (Amersham Biosciences) for 48 h as described previously (9Dransfield I.

For transient transfection experiments, HSB-2 cells (3.5 × 107) were washed twice with cold RPMI and resuspended in 500 μl of cold Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) before being placed in a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (BTX Instruments, Holliston, MA). DNA (15 μg) was added, and transfections were conducted at 310V 2 pulses for 10 ms using a ECM830 BTX electroporation system. After the electroporation bursts, the cells were transferred to plastic dishes and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Transfection efficiencies were estimated by flow cytometry 16–24 h after electroporation.Cell Attachment and Morphological Analysis of T Cells—Induction of T cell adhesion to either ICAM-1 or poly-l-lysine-coated dishes was performed as described elsewhere (17Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Gomez M. Luque A. Hogg N. Sanchez-Madrid F. Cabanas C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1891-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well flat-bottom plates and 35- and 90-mm dishes were pre-coated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg/ml ICAM-1-Fc in PBS, blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for1hat room temperature, and then washed twice with RPMI 1640. In control integrin-independent adhesion experiments, wells or dishes were pre-coated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml poly-l-lysine in PBS. T cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 and starved in RPMI 1640 without serum for 90 min. In some cases cells were pre-treated for 30 min at 37 °C with the PI3K inhibitors (100 μm LY294002 or 100 nm wortmannin). After this pre-incubation, cells were plated on the dishes and stimulated or not by the addition of 200 μm Mn2+ or 10 μg/ml KIM-127 mAb to activate LFA-1. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for different periods of time prior to lysis and further analysis of Rac-1, Vav, PI3K, Akt-1, or PYK-2. For morphological studies, T cells were allowed to adhere for 90 min and then unbound cells were removed by three washes with PBS. Attached cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 2% methanol in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol. The morphological changes were analyzed by microscopy.LFA-1 Cross-linking Activation—T cells (5–20 × 106 cells for each condition) were washed twice and starved in RPMI 1640 with 20 mm Hepes (RPMI-Hepes) for 90 min. Cells were then pre-treated or not for 30 min at 37 °C with the PI3K inhibitors (100 μm LY294002 or 100 nm wortmannin). After this period, cells were treated with the anti-LFA-1 mAb Lia3/2.1 (10 μg/ml) and incubated with gentle rotation for an additional period of 50 min at 4 °C. Unbound antibody was removed by subjecting the cells to three washes in 20 mm Hepes/RPMI medium. LFA-1 was cross-linked by adding polyclonal anti-mouse-IgG (25 μg/ml) in 20 mm Hepes/RPMI medium. Finally, cells were washed once with cold 20 mm Hepes/RPMI medium and lysed in the appropriate buffer (see “Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting”).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For PI3K immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10% glycerol).

All lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, and the pellets were discarded. For PI3K, Vav, Rac phosphorylation, and PYK-2 assays, immune complexes from supernatants were precipitated overnight at 4 °C with protein A or protein G linked to agarose. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the specific lysis buffer and either used for PYK2/PI3K in vitro kinase reactions or extracted in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0,1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) and boiled for 5 min for one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. To analyze Akt activation, clarified lysates were extracted in 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer whereas to study Rac phosphorylation Rac-AU5 from clarified lysates was immunoprecipitated and then extracted in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked using 3% nonfat dried milk or 3% BSA in PBS and incubated with the appropriate antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents.PI3K in Vitro Kinase Reactions—Reactions were performed as described (46Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A.

Pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of kinase buffer, and the reaction was started by adding 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 20 μg of l-α-phosphatidylinositol. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of chloroform. Lipids were extracted by adding 200 μl of chloroform:methanol:HCl (100:200:2, v/v). After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C, 50 μl of the lower organic phase was applied to an oxylated silica gel plate. Lipids were resolved by thin-layer chromatography using a solvent mixture of cloroform:methanol:water (75:20:5, v/v). Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was detected by autoradiography.PYK-2 in Vitro Kinase Reactions—Reactions were performed as described (17Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Gomez M. Luque A. Hogg N.

Briefly, immunoprecipitates were washed and pelleted three times in Lysis Buffer D and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes and 3 mm MnCl2, pH 7.35). Pellets were dissolved in 40 μl of kinase buffer, and the reactions were started by adding 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 15 min and then stopped on ice by adding 10 mm EDTA. Pellets were washed in lysis buffer containing 10 mm EDTA, extracted for 5 min at 90 °C in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Rac-1 Pull-down Activity Assays—GST-PAK-CRIB fusion proteins were a kind gift from Dr. J. G. Collard (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Rac activity assays were performed with slight modifications as described previously by Sander et al.

In brief, after induction of LFA-1 activation (by Mn2+- or KIM-127-induced adhesion to ICAM-1 or cross-linking) and/or transfection with relevant constructs, T cells were lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold Lysis Buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm NaPPi, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm PMSF). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and 15 μl of these samples were used for loading controls. Cleared lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST-PAK-CRIB coupled to glutathione-agarose beads to precipitate GTP-bound Rac-1. Precipitated complexes were washed three times in ice-cold Lysis Buffer E and boiled in sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0,05 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 3% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol). Proteins from total lysates and precipitates were fractionated by 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-Rac-1 mAb.Time-lapse Fluorescence Microscopy—HSB-2 T cells were transiently transfected with CA-Vav cDNA or CA-Rac cDNA (see “Expression Constructs and Transient Transfection Assays”) as described above and grown in complete RPMI 1640 medium for 16–24 h. Then, after removal of death cells by a Ficoll grad"
https://openalex.org/W2156114133,"A critical challenge in cancer research is to identify genetic lesions that sensitize patients to chemotherapy. p53, which is mutated in nearly one-third to half of glioblastomas, may be such a lesion. In this paper, we demonstrate that p53 disruption dramatically sensitizes glioblastoma cells to DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor-mediated apoptosis. Using 19 glioblastoma cell lines, including 15 low-passage ex vivo cell lines derived from patients, as well as isogenic glioblastoma cells varying in p53 status, we show that clinically relevant levels of SN-38 potently induce cell cycle arrest and temporary senescence in glioblastoma cells with wild-type p53 while causing massive apoptosis in p53-deficient cells (P<0.0002). We demonstrate that glioblastoma cells with wild-type p53 proliferate when recultured in drug-free medium, whereas p53-deficient cells do not. We also show that p16 protein expression is neither necessary nor sufficient for initiation and/or maintenance of SN-38-induced arrest/senescence. These results indicate that p53 disruption has a dramatic effect on how glioblastoma cells process topoisomerase I inhibitor-mediated DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2013616166,"Ricin, one of type II ribosomal inactivating proteins, inhibits protein biosynthesis by its RNA N-glycosidase activity. By yeast two-hybrid screening, the human BAT3 (HLA-B-associated transcript3) was isolated as a ricin A-chain interacting protein. A canonical caspase-3 cleavage site, DEQD1001 was found at the C-terminal region of BAT3. Ricin induced the apoptosis by activating caspase-3 and leading to the cleavage of BAT3 at 4 h after treatment while DNA laddering at 24 h. The cleavage is completely inhibited by zDEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 specific inhibitor. In addition, cleavage of BAT3 is blocked in caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells, indicating that BAT3 is a novel caspase-3 substrate. Evidence indicates that caspase-3 activated by ricin acts on BAT3 at the caspase cleavage site, DEQD1001 to release a C-terminal fragment designated CTF-131. The CTF-131 induces phosphatidylserine exposure, cell rounding, and chromatin condensation as ricin does. Moreover, silencing expression of endogenous BAT3 concomitantly suppresses ricin-induced apoptosis. Together, our results suggest a model that ricin triggers morphological changes of apoptosis by caspase-3-mediated proteolytic activation of BAT3.

In clinical trials, RTA has been used in construction of the immunotoxin, also known as the magic bullet, which is composed of a tumor cell-specific monoclonal antibody and a toxin moiety (10Ghetie V.

Pastan I. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 86-94Google Scholar). Evidence indicates that RTA or the RTA-derived immunotoxin leads not only to protein synthesis inhibition but also to activation of a caspase-3-like protease for execution of apoptosis (7Baluna R. Coleman E. Jones C. Ghetie V. Vitetta E.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 417-424Google Scholar, 8Komatsu N. Oda T. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 1038-1044Google Scholar). In Drosophila melanogaster, reaper acts as a central controller for the induction of programmed cell death (14White K. Grether M.E. Abrams J.M. Young L. Farrell K. Steller H. Science. 1994; 264: 677-683Google Scholar). Recently, Xenopus Scythe was identified as a novel reaper-binding apoptotic regulator (15Thress K. Henzel W. Shillinglaw W. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6135-6143Google Scholar, 16Thress K. Evans E.K. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5486-5493Google Scholar). An unknown Scythe-sequestered cytochrome c releasing activity is relieved upon reaper binding. In humans, a Scythe homologue termed HLA-B-associated transcript3 (BAT3) was cloned by Benerji et al. (17Banerji J. Sands J. Strominger J.L. Spies T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2374-2378Google Scholar). BAT3 is a proline-rich protein, which is localized in the nucleus. It contains a N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain and two functional C-terminal nuclear localization signals (17Banerji J. Sands J. Strominger J.L. Spies T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2374-2378Google Scholar, 18Manchen S.T. Hubberstey A.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1075-1082Google Scholar). BAT3 and Scythe share 62% amino acid sequence similarity, whereas whether BAT3 also functions as an apoptotic regulator is not yet understood. Although RTA inhibits translation and activates caspase-3 to promote cell death, however, the precise molecular mechanism is unclear. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we have identified the BAT3 as a RTA-binding protein. Through amino acid sequence analysis, we noticed a canonical caspase-3 cleavage site, DEQD1001, in the C-terminal region of BAT3, which is absent in the corresponding region of Scythe. This observation prompts us to study the role of BAT3 in apoptotic regulation. In this report, we demonstrate the cleavage of BAT3 by ricin-induced caspase-3, suggesting that BAT3 is physiologically relevant to ricin-triggered apoptosis. Moreover, we identify a C-terminal caspase-3-generated fragment of BAT3 designated as CTF-131, which can execute apoptotic activities, such as cell rounding, shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and phosphatidylserine externalization. Silencing expression of endogenous BAT3 by antisense oligonucleotide transfection suppresses ricin-triggered apoptosis. Taken together, our results support a model that BAT3 is a novel cellular target of caspase-3 and its caspase-cleaved fragment, CTF-131, mediates ricin-induced apoptotic morphological changes. Materials—The CaspACE® assay system was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The caspase-3 inhibitor, zDEVD-fmk, and fluorescent tetrapeptide protease substrates, Ac-LEHD-AFC and Ac-IETDAFC, were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All of the restriction enzymes used in this study were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. Anti-active caspase-3 antibody (31A1067) was obtained from IMGENEX (San Diego, CA). Anti-human Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (4D7) was purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). High fluorescent FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibodies were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Annexin-V-Alexa 568 detection kit was purchased from Roche Applied Sciences (Ottweiler, Germany). Anti-cytochrome c antibodies (6H2.B4, and 7H8.2C12) were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Transfection and Cell Death Assays—HeLa and MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine, 44 mm sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 10 units/ml penicillin G, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were seeded at 4-5 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish the day before transfection. Transfection reactions were performed by LipofectAMINE® and PLUS® reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). To examine caspase-3 activation, HeLa cells at 80% confluence were preincubated with 50 μm zDEVD-fmk or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) and then treated with ricin (100 ng/ml) for various periods of time. The cells were lysed with extraction buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. The ability of BAT3 or CTF-131 to induce apoptotic morphological changes was assayed as follows. HeLa cells grown on coverslips were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding GFP (0.5 μg) and BAT3, CTF-131, or empty vector (2.0 μg each), and the apoptotic GFP-expressing cells were observed by conventional fluorescence or confocal microscopy. The percentage of apoptotic cells in each experiment was expressed as the number of round cells as a fraction of the total number of GFP-expressing cells. The data represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. To assess the apoptotic morphological changes (Fig. 4C), HeLa cells were transfected with expression vector encoding BAT3 or CTF-131 for 24 h, and then cells were washed twice with incubation buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2). The cells were incubated with annexin V-Alexa 568 labeling solution for 15 min in the dark. For analysis of ricin-triggered apoptosis (Fig. 1B), the cells were treated with ricin (100 ng/ml) for 4 h followed by annexin V staining as described above. The annexin V-labeled cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and probed with anti-FLAG antibody and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon) for detection of overexpressed proteins. The FITC- or annexin V-Alexa 568-labeled cells were visualized under a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2).Fig. 1Characteristics of apoptosis triggered by ricin. A, DNA fragmentation in ricin-treated cells. HeLa cells were treated with ricin (100 ng/ml) for various periods of time or mock treated (-) for 24 h as indicated on the top of this figure. DNA samples were electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel followed by ethidium bromide staining and UV detection. The DNA laddering pattern appeared after exposure of cells to ricin for 24 h. Molecular weight markers (M) in kbp are shown on the left. B, ricin induces the exposure of PS. HeLa cells were treated with ricin (100 ng/ml) for 4 h followed by annexin V and Hoechst dye staining for cell surface-exposed PS and the nucleus, respectively. The staining and confocal microscopy analyses were performed as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Arrowheads indicate that the cells display PS exposure (left panel), nuclear condensation (central panel), and cell rounding (right panel) after treatment with ricin in the same field. Scale bar = 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To assess DNA ladder formation, HeLa cells were treated with ricin (100 ng/ml) for various periods of time at 37 °C. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (0.5 mg/ml proteinase K and 0.5% Sarcosyl in PBS), and the cell lysates were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h and then treated with 10 μg/ml RNase A for 1 h followed by gentle extraction with phenol and chloroform. The extracted DNA was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. The viability of transfected cells with various apoptotic stimuli was determined by measurement of their capacity to exclude the vital dye trypan blue (19Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Because wild type ricin A-chain (RTA) is detrimental to yeast, the RTA catalytic mutant (E177Q,R180L) was used as bait to screen a Jurkat cDNA library according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Clontech). Eighteen clones were isolated and 12 among these encoded the same fragment of BAT3 (BAT3-(614-1044)). For liquid culture assay, the yeast cells were grown overnight in the SD/Trp-, Leu- medium, and the cells were diluted 5-fold in YPD media and grown to mid-log phase (A600, 0.4-0.8). The cells were collected by centrifugation and the cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of Z-buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and 160 μl of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside in Z-buffer (4 mg/ml) was added. The hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was measured at A420. The β-galactosidase activity is represented in Miller units (47Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar), and the results are expressed as the mean of triplicate measurements ± S.D. In Vitro Binding Assay—GST-RTA fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography on a glutathione (GSH)-agarose-4B column. Aliquots of cytosolic extracts were incubated with GST-RTA or GST in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.13 mm ZnCl2 and protease inhibitor mixture) at 4 °C for 2 h. The protein complexes were precipitated by GSH-agarose beads and washed in washing buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm ZnCl2) four times. The bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. Measurement of Caspases Activities—The CaspACE® assay system was used according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, cytosolic extracts (50 μg) were incubated with 240 μl of reaction buffer containing 80 μl of caspase buffer, 5 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 30 °C and then fluorescent tetra-peptide substrate was added at a final concentration of 50 μm. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Cleavage of fluorogenic substrate was quantitated by using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4500, Hitachi) at 380/440 or 400/505 nm. Preparation of Subcellular Fractions—HeLa cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and suspended in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), and 250 mm sucrose, and then cells were homogenized by 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the crude mitochondria fraction. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to obtain the cytosolic fraction, and subjected to Western blotting with anti-cytochrome c antibody. Western Blotting—For Western blotting analysis, cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitor mixture). Cell extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and then the clear supernatant was separated in 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by a semidry blotting apparatus, and the blot was probed with anti-FLAG (1:1000) monoclonal antibody for N-terminal FLAG-tagged proteins or with anti-CTF-131 polyclonal antibody (1:1500) for detection of endogenous BAT3 and CTF-131 apoptotic fragments. After the first antibody binding, the blot was washed in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137.5 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) incubation for enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences), and then developed on x-ray film (Kodak). For cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation, cytosolic fractions were separated in 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-cytochrome c and anti-active caspase-3 antibodies. Production of CTF-131 by Baculovirus and Its Polyclonal Antibody— The CTF-131 cDNA was PCR amplified and cloned in-frame into the baculovirus transfer vector, pAcSG-His (BD Pharmingen) with 5′-NotI and 3′-KpnI flanking sites to yield pAcSG-His-CTF-131 recombinant transfer plasmid. For generation of recombinant baculoviruses, Sf9 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/60-mm culture dishes, and the cells were co-transfected with the pAcSG-His-CTF-131 and BacVector-3000 (Novagene, Madison, WI). Four hours later, cells were washed with Sf-900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen) twice, and the medium was replaced with 3 ml of fresh Sf-900 II SFM. Five days post-transfection, the supernatant in the dish was collected and the recombinant viruses were identified by Southern blotting analysis. For production of recombinant proteins, 1 × 109 Sf9 cells were seeded in a T75 flask for 15 min, and the seeded cells were then infected with a high-titer stock solution of recombinant baculoviruses at 27 °C for 3 days. The transfected cells were collected by centrifugation and the cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors mixture) at 4 °C for 45 min. The clear cell extracts were obtained by centrifugation, and the N-terminal His6-tagged CTF-131 was purified from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Novagen). To obtain anti-CTF-131 serum, the purified N-terminal His6-tagged CTF-131 was subjected to a 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and the CTF-131 band was excised from the gel and used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits. After three courses of immunization, the serum was isolated and tested for its specificity against endogenous BAT3 and the CTF-131 apoptotic fragment. Expression Vectors and cDNA Cloning—BAT3 cDNA was amplified from the Jurkat cDNA library by using ExTaq® (TaKaRa, Otsu, Shiga, Japan) DNA polymerase with the following primers: 5′ NotI primer: 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCGATGGAGCCTAATGATAGTACCAGT; 3′ BglII primer: 5′-GGAAGATCTCTAAGGATCATCAGCAAAGGCCCGCTG. The PCR products were cloned in-frame into the pCMV2-FLAG mammalian expression vectors (Kodak) to obtain the FLAG-BAT3 or FLAG-BAT3-myc clones. The cDNA clones used in this study were confirmed by sequencing. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—HeLa cells grown on coverslips were transfected as described above. Immunostaining was performed on cells fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS on coverslips. To detect FLAG-tagged BAT3 and its variants, the fixed cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min and blocked in blocking buffer (10% fetal bovine serum in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then probed with anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature followed by extensive washing in blocking buffer. The washed cells were stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) for 45 min at room temperature. During the last 15 min of secondary antibody staining, Hoechst 33258 (5 μg/ml) was applied for visualization of the nucleus. After washing, slides were mounted in mounting solution (80% glycerol in PBS), and were sealed with nail polish. For analysis of the cytochrome c release, mouse monoclonal antibody against cytochrome c (6H2.B4) was used to probe the cells at a dilution of 1:1000. For visualization of endogenous BAT3, the first and second antibodies were replaced with anti-CTF-131 (1:500) and Alexa 568-conjugated IgG (1:1000), respectively. To determine co-localization of BAT3 with ricin in vivo, HeLa cells grown on coverslips were washed with ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with FITC-labeled ricin (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 30 min for ricin attachment on the cell membrane. To allow endocytosis of ricin, the cells were transferred to an incubator at 37 °C in the dark for 1 h, and then washed with 0.1 m galactose in PBS twice to remove free and membrane-bound ricin. The cells were subjected to immunostaining for observation of the endocytosed ricin and endogenous BAT3 as described above. Oligonucleotides Used to Inhibit Endogenous BAT3 Expression— Translation of BAT3 was suppressed by treatment of cultures with phosphorothioate-substituted DNA oligonucleotides (Invitrogen). An antisense oligonucleotide (AS) consisting of the sequence 5′-ACTATCATTAGGCTCCATGG-3′, which is the inverse complement of the coding sequence -2 to +19 of the human BAT3 transcript. The scrambled control (SC) oligonucleotide has the same nucleotide composition as the AS, whereas the sequence is 5′-TAGCTGTATCCATGCACATG-3′. Oligonucleotides were stored in serum-free medium, aliquoted, and frozen at -80 °C. For silencing the expression of BAT3, cells were transfected with the AS or SC at a final concentration of 250 nm by OligofectAMINE® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection for 24 h, cell extracts were collected and subjected to Western blotting with anti-CTF-131 antibody. For analysis of cell rounding, the AS or SC-transfected cells were treated with ricin (100 ng/ml) for 4 h followed by microscopic analysis (Zeiss, Axioskop 2). For quantitative analysis, 400 cells were counted in each of three independent experiments. The fraction of cells with apoptotic morphology as a percentage of all cells in the same field was calculated. The percentage is expressed as the mean ± S.D. Ricin-triggered Hallmarks of Apoptosis—The typical laddering pattern of fragmented DNA appeared after exposure of HeLa cells to ricin (100 ng/ml) for 24 h (Fig. 1A), whereas cell surface-exposed phosphatidylserine (PS) occurred at 4 h (Fig. 1B). The results showed that ricin altered membrane asymmetry and resulted in externalization of PS. Moreover, ricin-treated cells displayed chromatin condensation and cell rounding, which were the characteristics of apoptosis (Fig. 1B, arrowheads) (20Martelli A.M. Zweyer M. Ochs R.L. Tabellini G. Narducci P. Bortul R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 634-646Google Scholar, 21Mills J.C. Stone N.L. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 703-707Google Scholar). These findings indicate that apoptotic morphological changes occur in ricin-treated cells. Identifying RTA Binding Protein(s)—By yeast two-hybrid screening, a fragment of human BAT3 (HLA-BAT3) was isolated and its interaction with mutant RTA was quantitated by a liquid culture assay (Table I). Full-length BAT3 with a N-terminal FLAG tag was expressed in cells. In the GST pull-down assay, GST-RTA bound to the glutathione-agarose beads was able to bind FLAG-tagged BAT3 from total cell extracts as revealed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A). We further examined in vivo interaction of BAT3 and ricin. HeLa cells were treated with FITC-conjugated ricin and stained for endogenous BAT3. As shown in Fig. 2B, green fluorescence indicated the endocytotic FITC-ricin (left panel) and red fluorescence showed the nuclear staining of BAT3 (central panel). In the right panel, there was co-localization of BAT3 and ricin as shown in yellow. These results suggest that ricin interacts with BAT3 in vitro and in vivo.Table ITwo-hybrid interaction assay between RTAcm and BAT3Protein fused to GAL4 domainβ-Galactosidase unitsaβ-Galactosidase units were measured as described by Miller (47).LacZ phenotypeDNA bindingActivatingMean ± S.D.pVA3-1bThe plasmids pVA3-1 and pTD1-1 contain murine p53 and SV40 large T-antigen, respectively, which serve as a positive control.pTD1-1bThe plasmids pVA3-1 and pTD1-1 contain murine p53 and SV40 large T-antigen, respectively, which serve as a positive control.383.68 ± 3.56BluepAS2-1-RTAcmcThe catalytic mutant of RTA (RTAcm, E177Q, and R180L) was used as bait to avoid detriment to yeast cells.pTD1-10.01 ± 0.01WhitepVA3-1pTD1-BAT3-(614-1044)dThe original clone isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screening, which encodes amino acid residues 614-1044 of human BAT3.0.02 ± 0.01WhitepAS2-1-RTAcmpTD1-BAT3-(614-1044)122.24 ± 4.11Bluea β-Galactosidase units were measured as described by Miller (47Miller J.H.

Open table in a new tab BAT3 Is a Novel Substrate of Caspase-3—To assess the involvement of caspases in ricin-triggered programmed cell death, we used various caspase tetrapeptide substrates in the following experiments. Cytosolic extracts from HeLa cells treated with ricin (100 ng/ml) for various periods of time were incubated with fluorescent substrates, Ac-YVAD-AMC, Ac-DEVD-AMC, Ac-IETD-AFC, and Ac-LEHD-AFC, which were specific substrates for caspase-1, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A, the caspase-9 activity was gradually increased during 4-6 h of incubation with ricin (panel III). The caspase-3 activity was dramatically increased to 4-fold after treatment of cells with ricin for 5 h as compared with that of the control group (Fig. 3A, panel IV). These results indicate that caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated at the early onset of ricin-triggered apoptosis. In addition, no significant increases of caspase-1 and caspase-8 activities were detected in ricin-treated cells (Fig. 3A, panels I and II). It was reported that caspase-8 is the key apoptotic initiator in the death-receptor pathway (extrinsic) (22Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltser Y.V. Wallach D.

Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated that caspase-8 mediates cytochrome c release in the Fas-receptor pathway through cleavage of Bid (24Li H. Zhu H. Xu C-J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Google Scholar, 25Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Google Scholar). Ricin activates caspase-9 and -3, but not caspase-8 suggesting that it triggers apoptosis through the cellular stress-induced mitochondria pathway (intrinsic) (26Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Google Scholar, 27Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Google Scholar). We showed that cytochrome c was released from mitochondria within 4 h of treatment with ricin (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Besides, caspase-3 activation determined by the appearance of active caspase-3 (Fig. 3B, lower panel) and cleavage of fluorescent tetrapeptide substrates (Fig. 3A, fourth panel) followed a similar time course as compared with the cytochrome c release. These results suggest that ricin induces apoptosis through the mitochondria pathway by activating caspase-9 and a downstream executioner, caspase-3.Fig. 3BAT3 is a novel caspase-3 substrate. A, time courses for activation of caspase-1, caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3, respectively. After treatment with ricin (100 ng/ml) for various periods of time (1-6 h), or mock treated (-) for 6 h, cytosolic extracts were isolated and incubated with caspase fluorescent substrates and assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” First panel, ricin could not induce caspase-1 activation. Second panel, no significant caspase-8 activation occurred during ricin treatment. Third panel, caspase-9 was gradually activated between 4 and 6 h of treatment with ricin. Fourth panel, ricin dramatically induced caspase-3 activation after treatment for 4 h. The data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.

In this study, we have identified a mycobacterial gene (Rv1500) that is involved in the synthesis of PIMs. We have named this gene pimF. Transposon mutagenesis of pimF of Mycobacterium marinum resulted in multiple phenotypes, including altered colony morphology, disappearance of tetracyl-PIM7, and accumulation of tetraacyl-PIM5. The syntheses of LAM and LM were also affected. In addition, the pimF mutant exhibited a defect during infection of cultured macrophage cells. Although the mutant was able to replicate and persist within macrophages, the initial cell entry step was inefficient. Transformation of the M. marinum mutant with the pimF homolog of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complemented all of the above mentioned phenotypes.

The mycobacterial cell wall modulates interactions between the tubercle bacillus and its environment. The cell wall consists of a covalently bound structure, the mycolic acid-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex, and a variety of free lipids that complement the mycolate residues to form an asymmetric bilayer (1Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Google Scholar, 2Liu J. Barry C.E. Nikaido H. Ratledge C. Dale J.W. Mycobacteria: Molecular Biology and Virulence.

Among the cell wall-associated lipids, phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) 1The abbreviations used are: PIM, phosphatidylinositol mannoside; LAM, lipoarabinomannan; PI, phosphatidyl-myo-inositol; LM, lipomannan; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; PSD, postsource decay; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MOI, multiplicity of infection; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: PIM, phosphatidylinositol mannoside; LAM, lipoarabinomannan; PI, phosphatidyl-myo-inositol; LM, lipomannan; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; PSD, postsource decay; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MOI, multiplicity of infection; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. and their multiglycosylated counterparts lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM), have emerged as major factors in mediating host-pathogen interactions and are presumed to be necessary for the survival and persistence of the pathogen within the host (4Strohmeier G.R. Fenton M.J. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 709-717Google Scholar). LAM has been implicated in various immunomodulatory effects, including the down-regulation of cell-mediated immunity (5Nigou J. Gilleron M. Rojas M. Garcia L.F. Thurnher M. Puzo G. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 945-953Google Scholar). In addition, the mannose-capped LAM found in the slowly growing mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium bovis, and Mycobacterium avium, has been shown to bind cell surface receptors of macrophages and dendritic cells and aid invasion of host cells (6Ernst J.D. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1277-1281Google Scholar, 7Maeda N. Nigou J. Herrmann J.L. Jackson M. Amara A. Lagrange P.H. Puzo G. Gicquel B. Neyrolles O. J. Biol.

Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 121-127Google Scholar). PIMs are known to mediate the attachment of M. tuberculosis to nonphagocytic cells and have been implicated in the recruitment of natural killer T cells, which affects the granulomatous response (9Apostolou I. Takahama Y. Belmant C. Kawano T. Huerre M. Marchal G. Cui J. Taniguchi M. Nakauchi H. Fournie J.J. Kourilsky P. Gachelin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34896-34904Google Scholar).Mycobacterial LAMs are lipoglycans composed of three structural components: the membrane anchor, which is a mannosyl-phosphatidyl-myo-inositol; the backbone, which consists of two homopolysaccharides, mannopyranose (Manp) and arabinofuranose (Araf); and the capping motif, which varies among mycobacterial species (11Chatterjee D. Khoo K.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Google Scholar, 12Nigou J. Gilleron M. Puzo G. Biochimie. 2003; 85: 153-166Google Scholar). At least three types of capping motifs have been described, including mannose-capped LAM found in slowly growing mycobacteria, PILAM found in the fast growing mycobacteria Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium fortuitum (13Khoo K.H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12380-12389Google Scholar), and AraLAM found in Mycobacterium chelonae (14Guerardel Y. Maes E. Elass E. Leroy Y. Timmerman P. Besra G.S. Locht C. Strecker G. Kremer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30635-30648Google Scholar).Despite their important biological functions, little is known about the biosynthesis of PIMs, LM, and LAM. Structural studies indicate that PIMs, LM, and LAM all share a conserved mannosyl-phosphatidyl-myo-inositol anchor, suggesting that they are metabolically related (12Nigou J. Gilleron M. Puzo G. Biochimie. 2003; 85: 153-166Google Scholar). Early studies with PIMs led to the proposed sequence of PI → PIMs → LM → LAM, which is supported by a growing body of biochemical and genetic evidence (11Chatterjee D. Khoo K.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Google Scholar, 12Nigou J. Gilleron M. Puzo G. Biochimie. 2003; 85: 153-166Google Scholar). PIMs are predominantly found as di- and hexamanoside forms, PIM2 and PIM6, respectively (10Gilleron M. Ronet C. Mempel M. Monsarrat B. Gachelin G. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34896-34904Google Scholar, 15Gilleron M. Quesniaux V.F. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29880-29889Google Scholar). The formation of PIM2 is catalyzed by two distinct mannosyltransferases, PimA and PimB (16Kordulakova J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B. Jackson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31335-31344Google Scholar, 17Schaeffer M.L. Khoo K.H. Besra G.S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. Belisle J.T. Inamine J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31625-31631Google Scholar). Using GDP-mannose as the sugar donor, PimA catalyzes the addition of one Manp to the 2-position of the myo-inositol of PI to form PIM1. PimB catalyzes the addition of another Manp to the 6-position to yield PIM2. Further mannosylation is mediated by PimC (18Kremer L. Gurcha S.S. Bifani P. Hitchen P.G. Baulard A. Morris H.R. Dell A. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 437-447Google Scholar), which transfers Manp from GDP-Man to PIM2, yielding PIM3. It has been proposed that PIM3 is further mannosylated to form high molecular weight PIMs, which leads to the formation of LM. LM is then glycosylated with arabinan to form LAM (12Nigou J. Gilleron M. Puzo G. Biochimie. 2003; 85: 153-166Google Scholar). However, genes involved in these subsequent glycosylation steps have not been identified, and details of this pathway remain highly speculative.LAM and LM are characterized by a linear α(1→6)-linked Man backbone punctuated by α(1→2) Man side chains. The PIM intermediates between PIM2 and LM/LAM are thought to be PIM3 → PIM5, so-called higher PIMs, since they all lack the α(1→2) Man side chains (19Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18460-18466Google Scholar, 20Khoo K.H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 117-127Google Scholar). PIM6, the other abundant class of PIMs, appears to be a terminal product, because it contains linear α(1→2)-linked Man, which is not found in LM and LAM (20Khoo K.H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 117-127Google Scholar).In this study, we have identified a mannosyltransferase that catalyzes the synthesis of higher PIMs and is involved in the biosynthesis of LAM and LM. We have demonstrated, for the first time, that disruption of PIMs affects LAM and LM synthesis, which provides direct evidence for the biosynthetic relationship of PIMs, LM, and LAM. In accordance with the nomenclature that has been used in the literature, we have called this enzyme PimF.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Mycobacterium marinum strain 1218R (ATCC 927) was obtained from L. P. Barker (NIAID, National Institutes of Health). Strain MRS2521 (pimF::ϕMycoMar) was generated by transposon mutagenesis of 1218R. M. marinum cells were grown at 30 °C in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco) supplemented with 0.2% glycerol and 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose complex (Difco) or on Middlebrook 7H11 agar (Difco) supplemented with 0.5% glycerol and 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose complex. Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for routine manipulation and propagation of plasmid DNA. E. coli strain DH5α λ pir116 (21Platt R. Drescher C. Park S.K. Phillips G.J. Plasmid. 2000; 43: 12-23Google Scholar) was used for isolation of transposon-containing plasmid. Antibiotics were added as required: kanamycin, 50 μg/ml for E. coli and 25 μg/ml for M. marinum; hygromycin B, 150 μg/ml for E. coli and 75 μg/ml for M. marinum.Generation and Screening of M. marinum ϕMycoMar Insertion Library—Propagation of the ϕMycoMar transposon phage and preparation of phage lysates have been described previously (22Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12712-12717Google Scholar). For phage infection, M. marinum 1218R cells were washed and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2. Phage were added at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1 and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to allow infection to occur. Bacteria were then plated on Middlebrook 7H11 agar supplemented with kanamycin and incubated at 30 °C. Kanamycin-resistant (i.e. transposon-containing) M. marinum colonies were patched onto Middlebrook 7H11 agar to obtain a library of 7680 (i.e. 80 plates × 96 colonies/plate) clones. Colonies with unusual morphology were identified by visual inspection.Localization of the ϕMycoMar Insertion—M. marinum MRS2521 chromosomal DNA was isolated by standard methods. Total chromosomal DNA was cleaved with BamHI, a restriction endonuclease that does not cut within the MycoMar element. Such digestion generates a restriction fragment containing the kanamycin resistance cassette and R6Kγ ori of the MycoMar element plus flanking chromosomal DNA. Self-ligation of this restriction fragment generates a plasmid that can replicate in E. coli strains containing the pir gene. Digested DNA was self-ligated with T4 DNA ligase and transformed into competent E. coli DH5α λ pir116. Plasmid DNA was isolated from KmR E. coli transformants. Oligonucleotide primers MAR1 (5′-CCCGAAAAGTGCCACCGTGAAAAGCCC-3′) and MAR2 (5′-CGCTTCCTCGTGCTTTACGGTATCG-3′) were used to determine the DNA sequence of the MycoMar/chromosomal junction. These DNA sequences were compared with the genome sequences of M. marinum and M. tuberculosis at the Sanger Institute (www.sanger.ac.uk/) and analyzed with NTI Suite software (Informax).Molecular Cloning—The pPMT plasmids were generated by cloning DNA fragments from the M. tuberculosis H37Rv BAC library (obtained from S. Cole, Institut Pasteur, Paris) (23Brosch R. Gordon S.V. Billault A. Garnier T. Eiglmeier K. Soravito C. Barrell B.G. Cole S.T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2221-2229Google Scholar) into the E. coli-Mycobacterium shuttle vector pNBV1, which contains a hygromycin resistance cassette (24Howard N.S. Gomez J.E. Ko C. Bishai W.R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 181-182Google Scholar). Plasmids pPMT1, pPMT2, and pPMT3 contain 2.2-kb PstI, 2.9-kb PmaCI, and 5-kb HindIII fragments of BAC58, respectively (see Fig. 2C).TLC Analysis of Cell Wall Lipids—The apolar and polar lipids were prepared from M. marinum cells (50 mg dry biomass) according to the published procedures (25Besra G.S. Parish T. Stoker N.G. Mycobacteria Protocals. Humanna Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 91-107Google Scholar). These lipids were analyzed by two-dimensional TLC on silica gel 60 plates (Whatman). Apolar lipids were developed with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (98:2, three times) in the first dimension and petroleum ether/acetone (98:2) in the second dimension. Polar lipids were separated with chloroform/methanol/water (60:30:6) in the first dimension and chloroform/acetic acid/methanol/water (40: 25:3:6) in the second dimension. Lipids were detected by charring with α-naphthol or 5% phosphomolybdic acid.Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis—Preparative TLC was performed to isolate lipids of interest for analysis by mass spectrometry. Briefly, polar lipids were separated on a set of four TLC plates that were run concurrently. One plate was charred by α-naphthol spray to determine the locations of lipids. The corresponding areas were scraped from the uncharred plates, dissolved in CHCl3/MeOH (2:1), and subjected to MS analysis at the Molecular Medicine Research Center, University of Toronto.MALDI MS spectra were acquired in DE-reflectron mode at positive mode on a Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a 337-nm laser. Acceleration voltage was set at 20 kV, grid voltage at 72%, guide wire at 0.001%, and delay time at 190 ns. MALDI-PSD spectra were acquired at DE-reflectron mode. The time ion selector was preset to the [M + H]+ mass of the analyte. The spectrum was acquired in 10 segments with mirror ratios from 1.0 to 0.06 and then assembled by the instrument software.Analysis of LAM and LM—To prepare crude extracts of LAM and LM, the delipidated cells (i.e. after the removal of polar and apolar lipids) were extracted three times with 50% ethanol. The ethanol extracts were evaporated to dryness and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate. Samples were then run on 10% Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For visualization of both LAM and LM, gels were silver-stained according to published protocols (25Besra G.S. Parish T. Stoker N.G. Mycobacteria Protocals. Humanna Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 91-107Google Scholar), except the reducing agent dithiothreitol was omitted. Western blotting was also performed to detect LAM, using the monoclonal α-LAM antibody CS-35, obtained from J. Belisle (Colorado State University). This antibody is specific for an arabinofuranosyl-containing epitope found in mycobacterial LAM but does not recognize LM (26Kaur D. Lowary T.L. Vissa V.D. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3049-3057Google Scholar).Infection of J774 Macrophages by M. marinum—The infection assay was performed according to a procedure described previously (27Ramakrishnan L. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3222-3229Google Scholar). The mouse macrophage-like cell line J774A.1 (ATCC TIB67) was maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 media with l-glutamine (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Prior to infection, J774 cells were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning) at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and maintained at 32 °C in 5% CO2. After overnight growth, the J774 cells were infected. Spent medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and sufficient mycobacteria to achieve a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 (i.e. one bacterium for one macrophage). The infection was allowed to proceed for 3 h at 32 °C in 5% CO2, after which time extracellular bacteria were removed by washing the J774 cells twice with fresh RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS. Subsequently, cells were incubated at 32 °C in 5% CO2, in 1 ml of fresh RPMI 1640 media with 10% FBS. The media for these cells were replaced every other day with fresh RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. On days 0 (3 h), 2, 6, 8, and 10, the infected macrophage monolayers (three wells/strain) were washed twice with fresh RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS and then lysed with 0.1 ml of 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) to release intracellular mycobacteria. After 15 min, 1× PBS was added to the lysed cells to give a final volume of 1 ml. The number of intracelluar mycobacteria was enumerated by plating appropriate dilutions (1:100, 1:1000, and 1:10,000) on Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates containing appropriate antibiotics. Agar plates were incubated at 32 °C for 7 days, at which time colony-forming units were counted.RESULTSIsolation of M. marinum MRS2521 Mutant—One goal of our research is to elucidate the pathways required for biosynthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall. To achieve this, we have taken a simple approach, based on the assumption that defects in certain cell wall components will alter the surface properties of the bacterial cell and give rise to colonies with unusual morphology. To this end, a library of ∼8000 M. marinum transposon insertion mutants was generated and visually inspected to identify clones with altered colony morphology. More than 2 dozen mutants have been isolated and partially characterized. Consistent with our goal, we have obtained mutants that exhibit altered mycolic acid composition and show defects in peptidoglycan and polyketide synthesis. 2D. C. Alexander and J. Liu, unpublished results. We recognize that colony morphology is a complex phenotype, and it is difficult to fully understand the structural basis. Nevertheless, our preliminary data and the evidence presented in this paper indicate that this is an effective approach toward the understanding of cell wall biosynthesis.The mutant described here, MRS2521, produced a distinctive “corona,” a wide, filmy, translucent border around the colony (Fig. 1). MRS2521 exhibited normal growth rate on solid media or liquid culture, and cells appeared normal when examined by light microscopy (data not shown). The sensitivity of the mutant to antibiotics, including rifampicin, streptomycin, isoniazid, and ethambutol, was the same as that of the wild type cell (data not shown).Fig. 1Colony morphology. Colonies of the wild-type parental strain 1218R (A), the mutant MRS2521 (B), and the mutant complement MRS2521/pPMT2 (C) on solid media are shown. Single colonies of the WT (D) and the mutant (E) are enlarged for better view. Mutant cells exhibit a wide, filmy, translucent border around the colony, which is distinct from wild-type cells. Cells of MRS2521/pPMT2 retain the wild type colony morphology.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Identification of pimF Gene—To identify the gene that had been disrupted by the transposon in MRS2521, we performed molecular characterizations of the mutant as described under “Experimental Procedures.” DNA sequencing and analysis of the MycoMar/M. marinum chromosomal junction revealed that the transposon had inserted at an TA dinucleotide, 412 bp downstream from the ATG start codon of a previously uncharacterized open reading frame, which we now call pimF (Fig. 2A). Sequence analysis revealed that the predicted protein product is homologous (78% identity, 86% similarity in amino acid sequence) to the Rv1500 of M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Fig. 2D). Inspection suggested that the pimF region of M. marinum was analogous to the Rv1497 → Rv1505 region of the M. tuberculosis genome (Fig. 2B). In addition to Rv1500, homologs to Rv1497, Rv1501, Rv1502, Rv1503, Rv1504, and Rv1505 are present. In both organisms, pimF/Rv1500 and Rv1501 appear to be co-transcribed. However, the M. marinum region is ∼11 kb larger than the corresponding portion of the M. tuberculosis genome and includes (at least) nine open reading frames not found in M. tuberculosis (Fig. 2, A and B). Other M. tuberculosis strains, including clinical isolates CDC1551 and 210, and M. bovis strain AF2122/97 contain a pimF homolog that is identical to Rv1500. Interestingly, a pimF homolog was not found in the complete or nearly complete genome data bases of M. leprae, M. avium, M. paratuberculosis, or M. smegmatis.Analysis of the Mutant Cell Wall Lipids—Sequence analysis reveals that PimF belongs to a large family of glycosyltransferases, designated Family 2 in the CAZy classification (afmb.cnrs-mre.fr/CAZY) and Group 2 in the Pfam data base. These diverse glycosyltransferases transfer sugar from various donors, including GDP-mannose, UDP-glucose, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine or CDP-abequose, to a range of substrates, including cellulose, dolichol phosphate, and teichoic acids. We postulated that PimF might be involved in the biosynthesis of a specific cell wall component, since the disruption of pimF affects colony morphology. The cell wall of M. marinum contains various glycolipids that can be differentially extracted by organic solvents, including phenolic glycolipids, phthiocerol dimycocerosate, triacylglycerol, and PIMs (1Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Google Scholar). To determine if the synthesis of these lipids was affected in the mutant, we applied established two-dimensional TLC developing systems (25Besra G.S. Parish T. Stoker N.G. Mycobacteria Protocals. Humanna Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 91-107Google Scholar) to examine these lipids. In all experiments, lipids extracted from WT cells under the same conditions were analyzed in parallel.Analysis of apolar lipids, including phenolic glycolipids, triacylglycerol, and phthiocerol dimycocerosate, did not reveal any difference between the mutant and the WT strains (data not shown). However, a distinct profile of polar lipids was observed for the mutant (Fig. 3). The mutant accumulated large amounts of one lipid (Fig. 3, A and B, spot 1, arrowhead) and failed to produce another (Fig. 3, A and B, spot 2, arrow), suggesting a precursor-product relationship between these two lipids. Previous two-dimensional TLC analyses of polar lipids of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG followed by structural determinations by MS and NMR established that these lipids represented various PIMs that differ in the degree of mannosylation and acylation (10Gilleron M. Ronet C. Mempel M. Monsarrat B. Gachelin G. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34896-34904Google Scholar, 15Gilleron M. Quesniaux V.F. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29880-29889Google Scholar, 18Kremer L. Gurcha S.S. Bifani P. Hitchen P.G. Baulard A. Morris H.R. Dell A. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 437-447Google Scholar). To confirm these structural predictions, spots 1 and 2 were purified by preparative TLC and subjected to MS analysis. Fig. 4A shows the MALDI-TOF spectra of spot 1, which consists of a group of molecular ions that differ in size by increments of 14, the molecular mass of -CH2-, suggesting that these ions belong to a homologous series differing only in the acyl chain length. The molecular ion at m/z 2308 was further analyzed by MALDI-PSD, and the resulting fragment ions are shown (Fig. 4B). Based on these data, we propose that spot 1 represents tetraacyl-PIM5 (Fig. 5). Similarly, spot 2 was analyzed by MALDI-TOF and MALDI-PSD (Fig. 4, C and D). The observation that the ion of spot 2 at m/z 2632 is two mannoses larger than m/z 2308 of spot 1 (2308 + (2 × 162) = 2632) and that the MALDI-PSD spectrum of m/z 2632 is nearly identical to that of m/z 2308 (Fig. 4, compare B and D) suggest that spot 2 represents tetracyl-PIM7 (Fig. 5).Fig. 3Two-dimensional TLC analysis. Polar lipids from the WT strain M. marinum 1218R (A), the mutant strain M. marinum MRS2521 (B), and mutant strains transformed with pNBV1, pPMT1, pPMT2, and pPMT3, respectively (C–F), were separated with chloroform/methanol/water (60:30:6) in the first dimension and chloroform/acetic acid/methanol/water (40:25:3:6) in the second dimension. Lipids were detected by charring with α-naphthol. Lipids of interest are indicated by arrowheads (spot 1) or arrows (spot 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4MALDI-MS and MALDI-PSD analysis.

Key fragment ions afforded in Fig. 4, B and D, are illustrated by the schematic drawings. We assume that both PIMs adopt α(1→6) Man linkage.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Three other lipids on the two-dimensional TLC, which were not affected in the mutant, were also analyzed by MS (data not shown) and identified as Ac3PIM2,Ac3PIM6, and Ac4PIM6 (Fig. 3A), which are consistent with previous studies (10Gilleron M. Ronet C. Mempel M. Monsarrat B. Gachelin G. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34896-34904Google Scholar, 18Kremer L. Gurcha S.S. Bifani P. Hitchen P.G. Baulard A. Morris H.R. Dell A. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 437-447Google Scholar).Complementation of the MRS2521 Mutant—To confirm that interruption of pimF was responsible for the altered lipid profile and unusual colony morphology of MRS2521, the mutant was transformed with plasmids containing the homologous M. tuberculosis Rv1500 gene. Plasmids pPMT1, pPMT2, and pPMT3, which contain Rv1500, Rv1500 plus Rv1501, and Rv1498 to Rv1502, respectively (Fig. 2C), restored the wild type colony morphology (Fig. 1C). These plasmids also complemented the two-dimensional TLC lipid profile of the mutant (i.e. the Ac4PIM5 accumulated in the mutant was converted to Ac4PIM7) (Fig. 3, D–F). In mutants transformed with pPMT1, slightly more AC4PIM5 remained. It is not clear if this is due to differences in PimF expression level in these constructs. However, mutant transformed with the cloning vector alone failed to restore the WT colonial morphology (not shown) or the lipid profile (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results suggest that PimF is a mannosyltransferase that mediates the biosynthesis of PIMs, specifically the synthesis of PIM7 from PIM5.Analysis of LAM and LM Synthesis—As mentioned above, PIMs are thought to be precursors of LM and LAM on the basis of the structural resemblance of these molecules (12Nigou J. Gilleron M. Puzo G. Biochimie. 2003; 85: 153-166Google Scholar). However, direct evidence to demonstrate this metabolic relationship has yet to be obtained. Disruptions of genes encoding mannosyltransferases involved in the early steps of PIM synthesis had failed to block the synthesis of LAM and LM (16Kordulakova J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G.

Genetic and biochemical evidence reveals that BxmR represses the expression of both bxa1, encoding a CPx-ATPase metal transporter, as well as a divergently transcribed operon encoding bxmR and bmtA, a heavy metal sequestering metallothionein. Derepression of the expression of all three genes is mediated by both monovalent (Ag(I) and Cu(I)) and divalent (Zn(II) and Cd(II)) heavy metal ions, a novel property among SmtB/ArsR metal sensors. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift experiments reveal that apoBxmR forms multiple resolvable complexes with oligonucleotides containing a single 12-2-12 inverted repeat derived from one of the two operator/promoter regions with similar apparent affinities. Preincubation with either monovalent or divalent metal ions induces disassembly of both the BxmR-bxa1 and BxmR-bxmR/bmtA operator/promoter complexes. Interestingly, the temporal regulation of expression of bxa1 and bmtA mRNAs is different in O. brevis with bxa1 induced first upon heavy metal treatment, followed by bmtA/bxmR. A dynamic interplay among Bxa1, BmtA, and BxmR is proposed that maintains metal homeostasis in O. brevis by balancing the relative rates of metal storage and efflux of multiple heavy metal ions.

Transition metal ions such as zinc, copper, iron, and manganese are essential trace elements that play integral catalytic functions in myriad metalloenzymes and electron transfer in all organisms (1Luchinat C.

However, they are required only in trace amounts and, when present in excess in the environment, even essential metals can be cytotoxic, like heavy metal pollutants (4Rosen B.P. Comp. Biochem.

All organisms have evolved a range of mechanisms that govern metal homeostasis, defined as maintaining the intracellular bioavailable concentrations of essential metal ions within a range compatible with cell viability (7Eide D.J.

Multiple lines of evidence from the past decade reveal that heavy metal homeostasis is maintained in all organisms by a small number of critical processes that include metal sensing, chelation, and transport (10Zhao H.

Two distinct mechanisms play prominent roles in governing metal ion homeostasis and resistance in many organisms. One involves the uptake or efflux of specific heavy metal ions across biomembranes, mediated by ATP-coupled high affinity metal ion transporters such as those derived from the CPx-ATPase family (19Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 20Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Another mechanism involves the specific chelation of metal ions by intracellular chelators, e.g. metallothioneins (MTs), 1The abbreviations used are: MTs, metallothioneins; O/P, operator/promoter; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis; DIG, digoxigenin; ORFs, open reading frames; RT, reverse transcriptase; rQRTPCR, real time quantification RT-PCR; IRE, inverted repeat element; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA. now known to be widely distributed in nature (13Robinson N.J.

Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To meet the diverse biological requirements of specific metal ions, various strategies have evolved to regulate the transcription of genes encoding these heavy metal homeostasis proteins. In prokaryotes, the expression of these genes is tightly controlled by specific metalloregulators or “metal-sensing” transcriptional regulators (12Busenlehner L.S. Pennella M.A. Giedroc D.P.

One such family of homologous metal sensor proteins is the SmtB/ArsR family, named for Synechococcus PCC7942 SmtB, a Zn(II)-responsive transcriptional repressor (26Morby A.P. Turner J.S. Huckle J.W.

Recent studies reveal that the metal ion actually sensed in vivo is at least partly dictated by the cytoplasmic milieu; this suggests that metal uptake/efflux, compartmentalization, and/or trafficking may play an important role in functional metal selectivity in vivo (37Cavet J.S.

Very little is known about how organisms integrate these complex metal-specific systems to achieve heavy metal ion homeostasis, particularly under conditions of vanishingly small concentrations of “free” metal ions thought to exist in cells (39Rae T.D.

Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Although metal transport and metal chelation systems are likely to be closely interdependent (26Morby A.P. Turner J.S. Huckle J.W. Robinson N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 35Changela A. Chen K. Xue Y. Holschen J. Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Mondragon A. Science. 2003; 301: 1383-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 41Liu T. Nakashima S. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M. Kasamo K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5027-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a molecular understanding of this interdependence in a single living organism remains poorly defined because these two resistance systems are usually found in separate bacteria. Oscillatoria brevis is the first bacterium identified that harbors both a zinc-related metallothionein, BmtA, and a CPx-ATPase, Bxa1, proposed to efflux metals outside of the cytoplasm, in order to achieve multiple heavy metal co-tolerance (41Liu T. Nakashima S. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M. Kasamo K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5027-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 42Liu T. Nakashima S. Hirose K. Uemura Y. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M. Kasamo K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We proposed previously that bmtA and bxa1 are components of the same metal homeostasis system (42Liu T. Nakashima S. Hirose K. Uemura Y. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M. Kasamo K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The studies presented here reveal that a newly identified SmtB/ArsR metal-sensing repressor, BxmR, represses the expression of two distinct transcription units, one encoding Bxa1 and the other a divergently transcribed operon encoding the metallothionein, BmtA, and the repressor itself, BxmR. Strikingly, the derepression of this complex metal homeostasis system is strongly regulated by both monovalent (Cu(I) and Ag(I)) and divalent (Zn(II) and Cd(II)) heavy metal ions. This is achieved by the direct binding of each of these metals to BxmR, which in turn, reduces the affinity of the regulator for the operator/promoter region, thereby inducing transcription. These findings suggest that the homeostasis governing storage and trafficking of multiple heavy metal ions in living cells could be mediated by a system that minimally employs a metallothionein, a metal transporter, and a metalloregulatory protein, analogous to zinc homeostasis in mammalian cells (43Andrews G.K. Biometals. 2001; 14: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Materials and Growth Conditions—The filamentous cyanobacterium O. brevis was grown at 25 °C in 200 ml of modified CT medium as described (41Liu T. Nakashima S. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M. Kasamo K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5027-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Liquid cultures grown to an optical density of 0.5 (660 nm) after ≈60 days were collected for genomic DNA isolation or metal-inducing transcriptional analysis after adding heavy metals to the cultures. Plasmid TOPO PCR 2.1-TOPO was obtained from Invitrogen. Plasmids were constructed and introduced to E. coli strain TOPO10 (Invitrogen) for amplification following the manufacturer's directions. DNA Manipulation—Genomic DNA and total RNA for PCR were isolated as described previously (41Liu T. Nakashima S. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M. Kasamo K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5027-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Identification of bxmR—Several cycles of thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR were employed as described previously (41Liu T. Nakashima S. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M. Kasamo K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5027-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to amplify the fragment upstream or downstream of bxa1 or bmtA gene. The amplified products were separated and subcloned into the TOPO PCR 2.1-TOPO vectors for DNA sequencing as described (41Liu T. Nakashima S. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M. Kasamo K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5027-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). GENETYX (Software Development Co., Ltd.) was used for DNA sequence and amino acid analysis. Preparation of the Cell Extracts from O. brevis—Cultures (1 liter) with an OD660 of about 0.5 (containing ≈0.1 g wet weight cells) were harvested and resuspended in 200 ml of medium containing ZnSO4 (60 μm), CdCl2 (16 μm), CuSO4 (16 μm), and AgNO3 (5 μm), respectively. After incubation for 24 h, cells were harvested and washed three times with buffer A (buffer A: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm EDTA). The cells were frozen by liquid nitrogen and resuspended in buffer A without EDTA and sonicated. Cellular debris was pelleted by ultracentrifugation (30,000 × g, 30 min) after incubation with DNase I. The resulting supernatants were further treated with 100,000 Mr cut-off membrane (Millipore), and the filtrates were immediately concentrated and desalted in buffer A without EDTA using an Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter unit (10,000 Mr cut-off, Millipore) before storage at -80 °C. The amount of final product was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Overexpression and Purification of BxmR—The primers 5′-GGGGCTCGAGTGTCACCGAAGTCTGCTGTTAAC and 5′-GACAAGAATTCCTAATGACTACTGACTAC were used to amplify bxmR using O. brevis genomic DNA as a template for PCR. Two restriction sites were incorporated into these primers, a forward site (XhoI) and a reverse site (EcoRI). Competent E. coli TOPO10 cells were transformed with the plasmid pBAD/BxmR constructed by subcloning the amplified product into the plasmid expression vector pBAD/MycB restricted with XhoI and EcoRI; the integrity of the plasmid construction was confirmed by dsDNA sequencing. LB medium (2 liters) supplemented with 50 mg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with the pBAD/BxmR-transformed E. coli cells (20 ml) incubated overnight. After incubation for 3 h, 0.02% l-arabinose was added, and cultures were further incubated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking/aeration for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resuspended cells were disrupted by ultrasonication. The low speed supernatant was collected after incubation with 0.02 mg/ml DNase I (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 5). Recombinant BxmR fusion protein containing an N-terminal polyhistidine tag (N-His6-BxmR) was purified from the supernatant by Ni(II)-chelate chromatography using a MagExtractor fusion protein purification kit (Toyobo, Japan) (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 6). N-His6-BxmR was then digested with enterokinase overnight at 25 °C to remove the N-terminal polyhistidine tag and further purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 7). Recombinant BxmR thus purified was estimated to be 96% homogeneous as assessed by scanning a photograph of the Coomassie-stained gel (Fig. 1, lane 4). The monomer concentration of BxmR was determined using the Bradford method standardized to bovine serum albumin. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis (EMSA)—The DNA probes for EMSA designated P5 (Fig. 2A) and P11 (Fig. 2B) were prepared by PCR using the primers shown (underlined sequences in Fig. 2, A and B). The 3′-end of each DNA fragment was labeled with digoxigenin (DIG) using terminal transferase and DIG-ddUTP and EMSA experiments carried out using a DIG-Gel shift kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions or standard methods. Purified recombinant BxmR at the concentration indicated or a crude O. brevis cellular extract was incubated with 80 fmol of DIG-P5 or DIG-P11 in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (or 5 μg for cell extracts), and/or poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT), 1 mm dithiothreitol, in a total volume of 20 μl at ambient temperature. The effect of exogenous metals on protein-DNA complex formation was examined by addition of either ZnSO4, CdCl2, CuSO4, or CuCl2 plus 4 mm dithiothreitol, and AgNO3 to the indicated total concentration. Reaction mixtures were incubated at ambient temperature for 30 min, and DNA-protein complexes were separated at 4 °C on an 8% nondenaturing PAGE and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Applied Science). The DIG-derived chemiluminescent signal was detected using the Lumi-Imager work station (Fuji Film), with the migration of protein-DIG-P5 or DIG-P11 complexes directly compared with DIG-labeled dsDNA markers of known molecular weight (Roche Applied Science). The intensity of the individual gel bands (Ii) was quantitated using an Image Analysis System/Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad) and converted to mol fractions of the ith DNA species, Θi, using Θi = Ii/∑Ii. In Vivo Analysis of Expression of bmxR, bmtA, and bxa1 Induced by Heavy Metal Ions Using Real Time Quantification RT-PCR (rQRTPCR)—For the experiments designed to examine the metal concentration dependence of expression, O. brevis cells (about 0.1 g wet weight) were suspended in 200 ml of a medium containing ZnSO4 (4, 8, 16, 32, 60, 92, or 122 μm), CdCl2 (2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 μm), CuSO4 (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, or 32 μm), and AgNO3 (2, 4, 7, 10, 15, or 18 μm) salts, respectively. Samples were harvested for total RNA isolation after incubation for 6 h. For the experiments designed to examine the kinetics of metal induction, ZnSO4 (60 μm), CdCl2 (16 μm), CuSO4 (16 μm), or AgNO3 (5 μm) was added to the same wet weight of O. brevis cultures as above. The cultures were then incubated at 25 °C for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h and harvested for RNA isolation as described above. The quantification of absolute mRNA concentrations induced by heavy metal ions was performed by rQRT-PCR using external standards as described previously (41Liu T. Nakashima S. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M. Kasamo K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5027-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 42Liu T. Nakashima S. Hirose K. Uemura Y. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M. Kasamo K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The integrity of the amplification of specific fragments was confirmed by melting-curve analysis and DNA sequencing (42Liu T. Nakashima S. Hirose K. Uemura Y. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M. Kasamo K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Transcription/Translation of bxa1 in E. coli Using an in Vitro bxa1 Promoter-driven Expression System—Three DNA fragments (designated P9bxa1, P10bxa1, and P11bxa1; see Fig. 2B) were amplified from O. brevis genomic DNA using PCR and the following primers: 5′-GGAATTAGGATGAGTGGCGT (sense primer for P10bxa1), 5′-GAAGCTAAAAGAAGATTCAGCCTTG (sense primer for P9bxa1), 5′-GAGTTAAAAATCTAGTATAT-3′ (sense primer for P11bxa1), and 5′-GGGGCATGCCTACTTTAAAACTCTAGTTGC-3′ (universal antisense primer). These PCR products were gel-purified and used directly as DNA templates in an in vitro transcription/translation assay carried out with a commercial E. coli S30 lysate (Extract System for Linear Templates from Promega). Reaction mixtures containing DNA template, purified BxmR, and metal ions (when added) were preincubated at 4 °C and then added to the E. coli 30 S lysate to a total volume of 50 μl, as recommended by the manufacturer. In vitro transcription/translation was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 2 h, with the translation products subsequently precipitated with acetone. The resulting pellet was resuspended with 20 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and loaded onto a denaturing 8% SDS-PAGE gel for electrophoresis. The expression level of Bxa1 was analyzed and quantified by Western blotting by using an antisera raised against Bxa1 as described previously (41Liu T. Nakashima S. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M.

BxmR Is an SmtB/ArsR Family Metalloregulatory Protein—Our previous work in heavy metal tolerance in O. brevis identified the genes encoding Bxa1, a putative heavy metal-transporting CPx-ATPase, and BmtA, a metal-sequestering MT (41Liu T. Nakashima S. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M. Kasamo K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5027-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 42Liu T. Nakashima S. Hirose K. Uemura Y. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M. Kasamo K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, those studies failed to identify a transcriptional regulator of the expression of these genes. In many bacterial heavy metal resistance systems, the genes encoding the transcriptional regulator and the resistance protein, i.e. an MT or a metal transporter, are organized either as two consecutive open reading frames (ORFs) or as a divergently transcribed operon (12Busenlehner L.S. Pennella M.A. Giedroc D.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We therefore sequenced DNA fragments carrying the bxa1 and bmtA genes derived from O. brevis. This led to the identification of a 411-bp ORF, found 506 bp upstream of the start codon of bmtA and in the opposite coding orientation relative to bmtA. We denote this gene bxmR (Fig. 2A). Blast searches using the deduced amino acid sequence of bxmR as query reveal that BxmR is a member of the SmtB/ ArsR family of metalloregulatory proteins (12Busenlehner L.S. Pennella M.A. Giedroc D.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 28Shi W. Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10728-10733Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). BxmR also shares 56% identity with Synechococcus PCC 7942 SmtB (26Morby A.P. Turner J.S. Huckle J.W. Robinson N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and ≈25-30% identity with other SmtB/ArsR family members in other bacteria (12Busenlehner L.S. Pennella M.A. Giedroc D.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The highest degree of sequence identity was found to reside in the putative helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain, as is typical for other SmtB/ArsR family members (12Busenlehner L.S. Pennella M.A. Giedroc D.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis of the region between bxmR and bmtA reveal the presence of an imperfect 12-2-12 inverted repeat element (IRE) with a conserved central core 5′-TGAAXXXXXXTTCA (Fig. 2, A and C). Previous work has shown that similar inverted repeats function as DNA-binding sites for other SmtB/ArsR homologs in a wide range of bacteria (Fig. 2C) (44Thelwell C. Robinson N.J. Turner-Cavet J.S.

Analysis of the putative promoter regions of the all7621 and tlr1018 genes from the cyanobacteria genome data base (www.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase/) also reveals the existence of a 12-2-12 inverted repeat showing high identity to the smt O/P (Fig. 2C). These data support the hypothesis that the highly conserved 12-2-12 inverted repeat elements in all cyanobacteria function as specific recognition sites for SmtB/ArsR-mediated regulation of target genes in response to specific metal ions. Most interesting, a 12-2-12 IRE with significant nucleotide sequence identity to that of bxmR/bmtA IRE was also found in the promoter region of bxa1, which encodes a putative CPx-ATPase (Fig. 2B). The presence of this IRE in the promoter region of bxa1 initially suggested that another SmtB homolog might be encoded close to bxa1. However, extensive DNA sequencing on both sides of bxa1 failed to locate a gene encoding an SmtB/ArsR homolog, nor was there any other identifiable candidate regulatory gene close by. Because previous studies indicated that bxa1 is strongly induced by metal ions (41Liu T. Nakashima S. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M. Kasamo K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5027-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 42Liu T. Nakashima S. Hirose K. Uemura Y. Shibasaka M. Katsuhara M. Kasamo K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), this sequence analysis makes the prediction that BxmR metalloregulates bxa1 transcription, like bmtA expression (see below). BxmR Specifically Binds to the 12-2-12 Inverted Repeat Elements in bmtA/bxmR and bxa1 Operator/Promoters with Similar Apparent Affinities—EMSAs were next carried out to determine whether recombinant BxmR binds specifically to the operator/promoter regions of both bmtA/bxmR or bxa1 in vitro. In order to roughly map the boundaries of the BxmR-binding site in both regions, the 506-bp region between the bmtA and bxmR ORFs was divided into four overlapping DNA segments of ≈200"

Whereas a number of p75 interacting factors have been identified, how these upstream factors function in a coordinated manner to mediate receptor signaling is still unclear. Here, we report a functional interaction between TRAF6 and the neurotrophin receptor interacting factor (NRIF), two proteins known to associate with the intracellular domain of the p75 neurotrophin receptor. The association between NRIF and TRAF6 was direct and occurred with both endogenous and ectopically expressed proteins. A KRAB repressor domain of NRIF and the carboxyl-terminal, receptor-binding region of TRAF6 were required for the interaction. Co-expression of TRAF6 increased the levels of NRIF protein and induced its nuclear translocation. Reciprocally, NRIF enhanced TRAF6-mediated activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) by 3-fold, while only modestly increasing the stimulation of NF-κB. The expression of both NRIF and TRAF6 was required for reconstituting p75 activation of JNK in HEK293 cells, whereas NRIF mutants lacking the TRAF6 interaction domain were unable to substitute for the full-length protein in facilitating activation of the kinase. These results suggest that NRIF and TRAF6 functionally interact to facilitate neurotrophin signaling through the p75 receptor.

Ni J. Aggarwal B.B. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Most receptors in this superfamily are characterized by their ability to regulate cellular survival and apoptosis, during the establishment and maintenance of the immune system as well as differentiation of neural cells and osteoclasts. Intracellular signaling pathways are activated by these receptors through recruitment of a variety of adapter proteins, including members of the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family (2Inoue J. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 3Bradley J.R. Pober J.S.

At present, there are six mammalian TRAFs that have been identified, TRAF1-TRAF6, which contain an amino-terminal activation domain, and a carboxyl-terminal TRAF-C domain, which mediates receptor binding and TRAF oligomerization (3Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). TRAFs 2, 5, and 6 contain RING and zinc fingers in their activation domains that function to mediate receptor stimulation of IκB kinase and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and subsequently activate their respective downstream transcription factors, NF-κB and c-Jun. The activation domains of TRAFs 3 and 4 also contain RING and zinc fingers and TRAF1 has zinc fingers, but no RING finger; however, none of these TRAFs have yet been shown to initiate a signaling pathway. TRAF6 is the most divergent member of the TRAF family, exhibiting the greatest variation in its receptor binding domain through which it mediates signaling not only through members of the TNF receptor family, including CD40, RANK, and the p75 neurotrophin receptor, but also several Toll-like receptors, such as interleukin-1R and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 (5Darnay B.G.

Similar to many receptors in the TNF receptor superfamily, the activation of these pathways by p75 has been shown to promote cell survival as well as induce apoptosis, depending on the cellular context (13Hempstead B.L.

Whereas there is accumulating evidence for a role for many of these factors in modulation of specific aspects of p75 signaling in various cell types, how these factors function together to determine downstream effects remains to be elucidated. Here, we report on a functional interaction between two of these signaling proteins, NRIF and TRAF6. NRIF was originally isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the intracellular domain of the p75 neurotrophin receptor as bait (21Casademunt E. Carter B.D. Benzel I. Frade J.M. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6050-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It is a C2H2-type zinc finger protein with a region homologous to KRAB domains, which have been shown to function as transcriptional repressors. NRIF interacts directly with the p75 receptor, and analysis of the nrif-/- mice suggested that it is required for p75-mediated apoptosis: cell death is significantly attenuated in the nrif-/- retina at embryonic day 15, a process known to be mediated by NGF stimulation of p75 (21Casademunt E. Carter B.D. Benzel I. Frade J.M. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6050-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Exactly how NRIF functions in p75 signaling is not known; however, given the presence of C2H2-type zinc fingers and the KRAB domain, it has been speculated that NRIF may shuttle to the nucleus to suppress transcription. In this study we found that TRAF6 and NRIF interact directly and this association resulted in translocation of NRIF to the nucleus and enhanced TRAF6 signaling. This interaction is important for receptor signaling because the binding of these two proteins was required for reconstituting p75 activation of JNK. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—COS7 and HEK293 cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in DMEM and 10% fetal calf serum, whereas the immature B-cell line WeHi 231 was grown in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and PC12 cells in DMEM with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum. The cells were grown on 10- or 15-cm Nunc dishes or, for immunostaining, on collagen-coated 15-mm glass coverslips. PC12 cells were differentiated by replacing the media with DMEM containing 0.5% horse serum and 50 ng/ml NGF. The cells were transfected using the standard calcium phosphate method or using LipofectAMINE™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For NGF treatment, 293 cells were washed 4× in DMEM with a 1-h incubation in the third wash. DMEM with or without 100 ng/ml NGF was then added to the cells. DNA Constructs—The plasmids containing the ATF-2 Gal-4 wild type and mutant fusion proteins, Gal-4 luciferase reporter, FLAG-tagged TRAF6 in pRK5, and FLAG-tagged dominant negative TRAF6 in pCMV4 were generous gifts of M. V. Chao (Skirball Institute, New York University). The TRAF2, 3, and 5 expression constructs were kindly provided by Dr. J. Inoue (Tokyo University, Japan) and TRAF1 was a gift from Dr. D. Ballard (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). The FLAG-tagged TRAF6 mutants (Fig. 3B) were generated by PCR using pFlag-TRAF6 as template. PCR products were cloned into pFlag-CMV using EcoRI and SalI. The primer sequence used for each mutant is as follows: ΔRING forward, 5′-CCGAATTCCTGCCCAAATAAAGGCTGTTTGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-CTAAGTCGACTACTACACCCCCGCATCAGTACTT-3′; ΔTRAFC and ΔCOIL forward, 5′-CCGAATTCCATGAGTCTCTTAAACTGTGAG-3′ and ΔTRAFC reverse, 5′-CTAGGTCGACTATCAGTTACACTGCTGTGCTTC-3′; ΔCOIL reverse, 5′-CTAGGTCGACTATCAGTGCAACTGGGTATTCTC-3′. GFP-tagged NRIF mutants (Fig. 3A) were generated by PCR and subcloned into pEGFP-C1 with SalI and BamHI. Amino-terminal deletion mutants were generated with a common reverse primer, 5′-CGGGATCCTATCAGTACATCTCAAGGCTG-3′, and the forward primers were: 5′-CAGGTCGACTCTCGCCAGAAGTTCCGACATTT-3′ for NRIFΔN161 and 5′-CAGGTCGACACCTCGGTGTCTAAGGACGAT-3′ for NRIFΔN241. The carboxyl-terminal mutants were created using the common forward primer 5′-CAGGTCGACATGGAGGACAGTATGGCT-3′. The reverse primer for NRIFΔC520 was 5′-CGGGATCCTATCACATGGCATCGCTACTGTCCATA-3′ and the reverse primer for NRIFΔC383 was 5′-CGGGATCCTATCACTGTAGATTCCCCACTTG-3′. The pGEX-NRIFΔZF construct was previously described by Casademunt et al. (21Casademunt E. Carter B.D. Benzel I. Frade J.M. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6050-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). NRIF-KRAB in pBSK was made by PCR amplifying the NRIF sequence from amino acids 1 to 383. GST-TRAF6ΔRING was created by subcloning TRAF6ΔRING from pFlag-CMV into pGEX-4T1. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Transfected cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were sonicated, cleared by centrifugation, and equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against NRIF, TRAF6 (SC8409, Santa Cruz), GFP (Roche), and protein A-Sepharose or anti-FLAG M2-agarose gel (Sigma). For immunoprecipitations from brain, whole brain was isolated from postnatal day 4 mouse pups lysed in RIPA and treated as above. The proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blot blocked in 0.1% milk powder and 1.0% bovine serum albumin in TBST (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The blots were probed with antibodies directed against NRIF, FLAG epitope (Sigma), or TRAF6 (SC8409, Santa Cruz). Biotinylated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (Vector Laboratories) were used as secondary antibodies and the signal was detected using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and Supersignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). For phospho-c-Jun blots, cells were collected and lysed in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) with 1 mm Na3VO4. The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 10 min, then the nuclei was pelleted at 750 × g for 5 min. The nuclear pellet was lysed in TLB (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4). Lysates were sonicated and cleared by centrifugation. Western blots were performed as described above and the blots were probed with anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser63) (Cell Signaling) and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce) and SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Recombinant GST Fusion Proteins—GST-NRIF fusion proteins were generated using standard GST fusion protein protocols (Pharmacia), with the following modifications. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in STE lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml lysozyme, 1.5% Sarkosyl, 3% Triton X-100), lysed by sonication, and the cleared lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline then resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-X100). GST-TRAF6ΔRING protein was produced similarly. Generation of NRIF Antiserum—GST-NRIFΔZF, produced as described above, was used to generate antiserum (produced by Invitrogen). The antiserum detected a single predominant band of ∼100 kDa in HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3-NRIF, which could be blocked by preabsorbing the antiserum with the recombinant protein (Fig. 2A). In Vitro Binding Assay—NRIF-KRAB, or luciferase control protein, were in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system according to the manufacturer's instructions (TnT kit, Promega). Glutathione-Sepharose beads with GST, GST-TRAFΔRING, or GST-NRIFΔZF were incubated overnight with the in vitro translated proteins at 4 °C in 400 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The Sepharose beads were washed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and then separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed, incubated in ENHANCE (DuPont), dried, and the bands were visualized by autoradiography. Immunofluorescence—Transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 24-48 h post-transfection and blocked in TBST with 10% goat serum for 1 h. Direct fluorescence was used to detect expression of GFP and GFP-labeled proteins. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to detect expression of TRAF6 using a TRAF6 monoclonal antibody (SC8409, Santa Cruz), or an antibody to the FLAG epitope (Sigma) followed by CY3- or Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, or biotin-labeled anti-mouse (Vector Laboratories) followed by exposure to Cy2-conjugated streptavidin. To visualize the nuclei, cells were incubated with 5 ng/ml propidium iodide for 5 min or mounted with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Endogenous NRIF was detected using affinity purified antiserum (1:100) followed by Alexa 546-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. The cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 or by confocal microscopy using a Ziess LSM 410. Reporter Assays—HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-NRIF, pFlag-TRAF6, and the ATF-2 Gal4 fusion plasmid with Gal4-luciferase reporter or a 6× NF-κB luciferase reporter. In some experiments a mutant ATF-2 (T71A) Gal4 plasmid, which is not activated by JNK or p38, was used as a control. To normalize for transfection efficiency, the cells were also co-transfected with pRSV-Renilla control vector. The cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection and luciferase activity was measured according using the Dual Reporter kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The reporter activity is reported as -fold induction relative to vector-transfected cells. NRIF Associates with TRAF6—TRAF6 binds not only to several cytokine receptors, but also to a number of intracellular signaling proteins; e.g. IRAK (32Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar), RIP2 (33McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 9567-9572Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which modify or propagate the receptor-TRAF6 signal. We considered the possibility that TRAF6 could associate with NRIF because both proteins were shown to bind to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (7Khursigara G. Orlinick J.R. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2597-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 21Casademunt E. Carter B.D. Benzel I. Frade J.M. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6050-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged TRAF6 and pcDNA3-NRIF, or control vectors. The lysate was immunoprecipitated with antisera to TRAF6 (Fig. 1A). Alternately, cells were transfected with a GFP-tagged NRIF and FLAG-tagged TRAF6, or control vectors, and cells lysates were immunoprecipitated with antisera to the GFP epitope (Fig. 1B). Using either antibody, we observed an interaction between NRIF and TRAF6. We also observed that TRAF6 expression substantially enhanced the levels of NRIF protein (Fig. 1A). Whereas in a few experiments NRIF was expressed at higher levels, even in the absence of TRAF6, in the vast majority of experiments we observed that NRIF expression was very low or undetectable when expressed alone. The mechanism of NRIF stabilization by TRAF6 remains to be elucidated. To determine whether the association occurred between endogenous proteins, we examined B-cells, which are dependent on TRAF6 function for proper development. TRAF6 and NRIF were immunoprecipitated from lysates of the immature B-cell line WeHi 231. The specificity of our polyclonal antisera to NRIF was verified by probing blots of HEK293 cells transfected with NRIF and TRAF6, or untransfected. The identity of the observed band as NRIF protein was confirmed by preabsorbing the antisera with GST-NRIFΔZF, the recombinant protein to which it was raised, or with control GST protein (Fig. 2A). This antibody was used to immunoprecipitate and immunoblot NRIF from WeHi 231 cells, resulting in the detection of a band at ∼100 kDa. Whereas the expected molecular mass of NRIF is 95 kDa, both endogenous and untagged, ectopically expressed NRIF run at 100 kDa, indicating that the protein may be post-translationally modified. An additional slightly higher band was also frequently observed, which may represent further post-translational modification of the protein (Fig. 2B). At present, we are unable to determine whether the endogenous bands represent NRIF or its homolog, NRIF2, because we found that NRIF2 is also recognized by this antibody and coimmunoprecipitated with TRAF6 when co-expressed in HEK293 cells (data not shown). However, the predicted size of NRIF2 is 93 kDa, and when ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells it migrates below NRIF, suggesting that the higher molecular mass bands observed in the WeHi cells are not NRIF2 (data not shown). Importantly, TRAF6 was also detected in the NRIF precipitate (Fig. 2B, lower panel), providing evidence of an association between the endogenous proteins. In a reciprocal manner, when TRAF6 was immunoprecipitated from WeHi cell lysates, NRIF was also precipitated (Fig. 2B, upper panel). In addition to its role in the immune system, TRAF6 has been shown to regulate brain development with targeted deletion in TRAF6 leading to increased exencephaly in mice (9Lomaga M.A. Henderson J.T. Elia A.J. Robertson J. Noyce R.S. Yeh W.C. Mak T.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7384-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to what was seen in the WeHi cells, TRAF6 also coimmunoprecipitated with NRIF in lysates from postnatal day 4 mouse brain (Fig. 2C). NRIF contains five zinc fingers of the C2H2-type in its carboxyl terminus, which often function as DNA binding domains for transcription factors. In addition to the zinc fingers, NRIF contains two amino-terminal domains found in a number of transcription factors of this subtype, a KRAB domain, and a SCAN domain. SCAN domains are thought to promote oligomerization and in vitro binding studies have shown that NRIF can form a multimeric complex (36Benzel I. Barde Y.A. Casademunt E. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 281: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). KRAB domains consist of KRAB A and B boxes and function as transcriptional repressor domains in a number of transcription factors (37Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 38de Haan G. Chusacultanachai S. Mao C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13493-13501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Lorenz P. Koczan D. Thiesen H.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The p75-binding domain lies in between the zinc fingers and the amino-terminal domains. To further characterize the domains of NRIF required for its interaction with TRAF6, a series of NRIF deletion mutants were constructed (Fig. 3A). The carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants were much more highly expressed than the full-length or amino-terminal mutant proteins; therefore, to achieve comparable levels of expression 10-fold less NRIFΔC520 and NRIFΔC383 DNA were transfected into HEK293 cells for the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Whereas the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants, NRIFΔC520 and NRIFΔC383 interact more strongly with TRAF6 than the full-length protein, the ability of the amino-terminal deletion mutants, NRIFΔN161 and NRIFΔN241, to bind TRAF6 was completely abolished (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that TRAF6 interacts with the amino-terminal KRAB domain. TRAF6, like all the TRAF family members, can be divided into an amino-terminal activation domain and a carboxyl-terminal TRAF domain (3Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The activation domain, consisting of a RING finger domain and a series of five zinc fingers, function together in the activation of NF-κB and JNK. The TRAF domain consists of a TRAF-C region, which functions in oligomerization of homo- and heteromeric complexes of the TRAF proteins and specificity of receptor binding, and a TRAF-N region, a coiled-coiled domain that in conjunction with the TRAF-C domain contributes to TRAF oligomerization. Deletion mutants of TRAF6 were used to map the domains of the protein that are required for its interaction with NRIF (Fig. 3B). TRAF6 lacking only the amino-terminal RING domain (ΔRING) as well as the dominant negative TRAF6, which lacks the entire activation domain (Dom. Neg.), were both able to bind to NRIF, whereas deletion of the TRAF-C abolished the association (Fig. 3D). No binding was detected using the ΔCoil mutant; however, deletion of the entire TRAF domain in this mutant resulted in low levels of expression. Although we cannot rule out possible misfolding of the deletion mutants, these results suggest that the protein interaction is mediated through the carboxyl-terminal TRAF-C domain of TRAF6. The TRAF-C domain separates TRAF6 from other TRAF family members because of its divergence in amino acid sequence from other TRAF molecules in this region. We therefore speculated that the interaction with NRIF may be specific for TRAF6. Indeed, when TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, or TRAF5 were co-expressed with NRIF, immunoprecipitation of these other TRAF molecules did not co-immunoprecipitate NRIF (Fig. 3D). To determine whether the association between NRIF and TRAF6 was direct, or might be mediated"

Alignment of the amino acid sequence of E. coli CMP-NeuAc synthetase with those from other bacterial species revealed that the conserved motifs were located in its N termini, whereas the C terminus appeared to be redundant. Based on this information, a series of deletions from the 3′-end of the CMPNeuAc synthetase coding region was constructed and expressed in E. coli. As a result, the catalytic domain required for CMP-NeuAc synthetase was found to be in the N-terminal half consisting of amino acids 1-229. Using the strategy of tertiary structure prediction based on the homologous search of the secondary structure, the C-terminal half was recognized as an α1-subunit of bovine brain platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase isoform I. The biochemical analyses showed that the C-terminal half consisting of amino acids 228-418 exhibited platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase activity. The enzyme properties and substrate specificity were similar to that of bovine brain α1-subunit. Although its physiological function is still unclear, it has been proposed that the α1-subunit-like domain of E. coli may be involved in the traversal of the blood-brain barrier.

Escherichia coli is one of the leading Gram-negative bacteria that cause neonatal meningitis. The mortality and morbidity associated with this infection are significantly high, with the case fatality rates ranging from 15 to 40% (1Gladstone I.M. Ehrenkranz R.A. Edberg S.C. Baltimore R.S.

Incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of this disease has contributed to the high mortality and morbidity. It is well documented that the most cases of neonatal E. coli meningitis are caused by K1-encapsulated bacteria (6Robbins J.B. McCracken G.H. Gostchlich E.C. Orskov F. Orskov I. Hanson L.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1974; 290: 1216-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Although several E. coli structures and/or genes have been shown to be essential for interaction with brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) 1The abbreviations used are: BMEC, brain microvascular endothelial cells; BBB, blood-brain barrier; PSAs, polysialic acids; CS, CMP-NeuAc synthetase; PAF-AH, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase; Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminic acids; PDB, Protein Data Bank; PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine.

Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5217-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which E. coli traverses across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are not clearly elucidated. It has been revealed that a high level of bacteremia is required for the development of E. coli meningitis by investigation of infants with meningitis and animal models (11Dietzman D.E. Fischer G.W. Schoenknecht F.D. J. Pediatr. 1974; 85: 128-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 12Kim K.S. Itabashi H. Gemski P. Sadoff J. Warren R.L. Cross A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, E. coli must be able to avoid host defense mechanisms and proliferate either in the blood or in tissues to maintain a high level of bacteremia. E. coli K1 capsular polysaccharides are polymeric sialyl residues connected by α2,8-linkages. Previous investigations have determined that the K1 capsular polysialic acids (PSAs), also known as homopolymers of N-acetylneuraminic acids (Neu5Ac), contribute to the high level of bacteremia by virtue of its serum resistance and antiphagocytic properties (12Kim K.S. Itabashi H. Gemski P. Sadoff J. Warren R.L. Cross A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that both E. coli K1+ and K1- strains are able to traverse BMEC in vitro and enter the central nervous system in vivo; however, only infections caused by K1+ strains resulted in positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures (13Hoffman J.A. Wass C. Stins M.F. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3566-3570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the K1 capsule has, in addition to its well recognized serum resistance and antiphagocytic properties, a role in the traversal of E. coli K1 across the BBB as live bacteria. The biosynthesis of PSAs is thought to take place on the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane through the α2,8-sialyltransferase-catalyzed addition of Neu5Ac residues from CMP-Neu5Ac donor to the nonreducing ends of nascent (acceptor) PSA chains. The proteins required for biosynthesis, including those needed for Neu5Ac synthesis, activation, and polymerization, are thought to form a multiprotein complex as capsule assembly apparatus (14Steenbergen S.M. Vimr E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15349-15359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the biosynthesis of NeuAc follows a different pathway in mammals and in bacteria, both systems converge in the activation step of the monomer, NeuAc (15Ringenberg M. Lichtensteiger C. Vimr E. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CMP-NeuAc synthetase (CS) utilizes CTP and NeuAc as substrates and produces activated CMP-NeuAc for α2,8-sialyltransferase (16Kapitonov D. Yu R.K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 961-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). CS-deficient mutants that do not express sialylated glycoconjugates can be complemented with functional CS in both mammalian cells (17Munster A.K. Eckhardt M. Potvin B. Muhlenhoff M. Stanley P.

Reglero A. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although bacterial and eukaryotic CSs share many catalytic properties, several important differences have been reported, including substrate specificity, tertiary structure, inhibitor sensitivity, and cellular localization (20Kean E.L. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, CS can be targeted by rational drug design strategies. In addition, CS is also of considerable interest in the field of biotechnology. Given the expense of chemically synthesizing CMP-NeuAc and its instability, CS together with various sialyltransferases is valuable for preparative enzymatic synthesis of biologically relevant, sialylated oligosaccharides (27Glibert M. Bayer R. Cunningham A.M. DeFrees S. Gao Y. Watson D.C. Young N.M. Wakarchuk W.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Recently, CS from Neisseria meningitidis has been crystallized as a dimer, and the active site residues, mononucleotide-binding pocket, substrate-binding pocket, and dimerization domain have also been identified (28Mosimann S.C. Gilbert M. Dombrovsky D. To R. Wakarchuk W. Strynadka N.C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8190-8196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The structural information obtained from N. meningitidis CS enables us to gain more insight into the structure and function relationships of its counterpart in E. coli. We have reported previously the cloning of the gene for CS from E. coli K1 strain 44277. By substitution of 6 bases in the initial region and stop codon of the wild type gene, we achieved a high level of expression of CS in E. coli. The recombinant CS protein consisted of 26% of the total bacterial proteins, and the activity was 850-fold higher than that of the wild strain (29Xia G. Han X. Ding H. Yang S. Zhang S. Jin C. J. Mol. Catal., B Enzym. 2000; 10: 199-206Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Alignment of the amino acid sequences of E. coli CS with its counterpart in N. meningitidis revealed that the highly conserved features, which include the phosphate binding loop, Mg2+, NeuAc, cytidine binding domain, and dimerization domain, mostly concentrate in the N-terminal half of E. coli CS. We therefore hypothesized that only the N-terminal half of E. coli CS was required for synthetase activity, whereas the C terminus appeared to be redundant. In order to verify our hypothesis, we constructed a series of enzyme mutants by truncating its C terminus. It turns out that the truncated enzymes were still active when more than 189 amino acid residues were removed from C terminus, and the instability of the mutants was also observed. Based on our observations, we concluded that C-terminal half might play a role in stabilizing of the catalytic domain. In an effort to better understand how the C-terminal half stabilizes the catalytic domain in the N-terminal half, we predicted the secondary structure of the C-terminal half and simulated the three-dimensional model by using the strategy of homologous search of the secondary structure. Strikingly, the C-terminal half was found to share a high three-dimensional structural homology with the α1-subunit of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) isoform I. Strong evidence has also been obtained to demonstrate that E. coli CS was a bifunctional enzyme that possessed both CS and PAF-AH activities. Here we present the first report that PAF-AH-like activity was recognized in a microorganism. Enzymes and Substrates—CTP, NeuAc, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAF; C16), 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, glycerol triacetate, 4-nitrophenyl butyrate, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), p-bromophenacyl bromide, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma. [acetyl-3H]PAF was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Restriction enzymes and Pfu DNA polymerase were purchased from Promega. T4 DNA ligase was purchased from Takara. All other biochemical reagents were the highest quality commercially available. Microorganism and Plasmids—E. coli strain 44277 was obtained from the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center. E. coli DH5α was purchased from Invitrogen. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and plasmid pET-15b were obtained from Novagen. The plasmid pET-CS2 containing wild type CMP-NeuAc synthetase gene has been described previously (29Xia G. Han X. Ding H. Yang S. Zhang S. Jin C. J. Mol. Catal., B Enzym. 2000; 10: 199-206Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Culture Conditions—Unless otherwise indicated, E. coli was routinely propagated at 37 °C in LB broth contained 10 g of bactotryptone, 5 g of bactoyeast extract, and 10 g of NaCl per liter of culture medium. Growth medium was supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin when required. Cloning and DNA Manipulations—All DNA manipulations were carried out using standard techniques described by Sambrook et al. (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or according to the manufacturers' instructions. Construction of Truncation Mutants—The C-terminal truncation mutants of CMP-NeuAc synthetase were generated by PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase. CMP-NeuAc synthetase mutant gene was amplified by using plasmid pET-CS2 as a template and a 5′-primer (5′-GTCCATGGATCTGTATCAGAACATTCATAATAGAATC) with an introduced NcoI site and a 3′-primer with a BamHI site. A stop codon was introduced into the 3′-primer so that translation could terminate at positions 395, 339, 283, 246, 229, 227, 224, 223, 221, 213, and 210. PCR was carried out by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. The amplified fragments were inserted into the corresponding sites of pET-15b, and the resulting plasmids were designated as pETCS395, pET-CS339, pET-CS283, pET-CS246, pET-CS229, pET-CS227, pETCS224, pET-CS223, pET-CS221, pET-CS213, and pET-CS210, respectively. As for N-terminal truncation mutants, the 3′-primer used was 5′-ATGGATCCTTATTTAACAATCTCCGCTAT, and a BamHI site was introduced. By introducing an NcoI site into 5′-primer, the translation of mutant construction could start at a chosen position with a start codon contained in the NcoI site. A mutant fused with a His tag was constructed by cloning the coding region for 230-418 amino acid residues into pET-15b at the sites of NdeI/BamHI.

The resulting transformant was grown at 37 °C in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When the A600 values reach 0.6-0.8, the culture was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 10 h at 25 °C. The cells were harvested at 5,000 rpm for 15 min and frozen at -70 °C until needed. Purification of the C-terminal Truncated CMP-NeuAc Synthetase—The cell pellets obtained from 1 liter of induced culture of transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS was resuspended in 80 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the cells were disrupted by sonication. The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was precipitated by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate. The proteins precipitated between 35 and 60% were collected and dissolved in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). After dialysis against 3 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 100 mm NaCl overnight, the enzyme solution was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (2.5 × 30 cm) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 100 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 1 column volume of initial buffer to remove unbound proteins. The enzyme was eluted with 2 liters of a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.10 to 0.25 m. The enzyme fractions were pooled, dialyzed against the initial buffer, and concentrated with Immersible CX-10™ (nominal molecular weight leakage (NMWL) 10,000-Da, Millipore). All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Purification of the N-terminal Truncated CMP-NeuAc Synthetase—Cells obtained from culture were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was collected. The supernatant was loaded onto a HiPrep 16/10-DEAE FF column (50 ml, flow rate 5 ml/min) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6)) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.3 m NaCl in buffer A. The fractions containing the target proteins were collected, dialyzed overnight in buffer A, and then loaded onto MonoQ HR 5/5 (20 ml, flow rate 0.5 ml/min), which had been equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6)). The mutant enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.5 m NaCl in buffer A. The fractions containing the target proteins were loaded onto Superdex 200/75 10/30 (100 μl, 0.5 ml/min) pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl. The fractions containing the target proteins were collected. All purification steps were carried out by using fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amer-sham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Enzyme and Protein Assays—The CMP-NeuAc synthetase activity was assayed using the thiobarbituric acid method (23Vann W.F. Silver R.P. Abeijon C. Chang K. Aaronson W. Sutton A. Finn C.W. Lindner W. Kotsatos M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17556-17562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was incubated in 250 μl of buffer containing 5.5 mm CTP, 2.8 mm NeuAc, 0.2 m Tris, 20 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol (pH 9.0). After the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, 50 μl of 1.6 m NaBH4 was added to destroy excess NeuAc at room temperature for 15 min. The mixture was then put on ice, and 50 μl of 20 n H3PO4 was added to decompose NaBH4. After standing at 0 °C for 5 min, the mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to cleave the phosphoester bond of the formed CMP-NeuAc. The free NeuAc was oxidized with 50 μl of 0.2 m NaIO4 at room temperature for 10 min, and 400 μl of 4% NaAsO2 in 0.5 n HCl was added. The solution mixture was then transferred to a test tube containing 1 ml of 0.6% thiobarbituric acid in 0.5 m Na2SO4 and heated in boiled water for 15 min. After the solution was cooled, 1 ml of the solution was taken out and mixed with 1 ml of cyclohexanone. The mixture was shaken and centrifuged, and the upper layer was subjected to absorbance measurement at 549 nm (ϵ = 4.11 mm-1 cm-1). One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of CMP-NeuAc/min under the conditions of the assay. The standard PAF-AH activity assay was carried out as described by Hattori et al. (31Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31345-31352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with small modifications. The specific activity of [3H]acetyl-PAF was adjusted to 200 dpm/nmol by dilution with unlabeled PAF. The standard incubation system for assaying consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 nmol of [3H]acetyl-PAF, and the sample in a total volume of 250 μl. The reaction was terminated by addition of 2.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v) and 0.25 ml of water. The radioactivity of an aliquot (0.6 ml) of each upper phase was measured to determine the amount of acetate liberated. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol of acetate/min. The assay for serum (plasma) PAF-AH activity was carried out using Azwell Auto PAF-AH kit (Nesco, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The substrate used in this assay was 1-myristoyl-2-(4-nitrophenylsuccinyl) phosphatidylcholine. Esterase activity assay was carried out at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), containing 4 mm of p-nitrophenyl butyrate. An extinction coefficient for p-nitrophenol of 7.2 ml mmol-1 cm-1 at 400 nm was used. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the appearance of 1 μmol of p-nitrophenol per min. Protein concentrations were determined by using the method described by Lowry et al. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. TLC Analysis of Substrate Specificity—Substrate specificity was assessed by TLC as described by Grigg et al. (32Grigg M.E. Gounaris K. Selkirk M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with small modifications. After incubation of 50 μg of phospholipids/lipids with the enzyme for 3 h at 37 °C, lipids were extracted by the Bligh-Dyer method (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar), dried under a stream of N2, resuspended in methanol, and then applied to silica gel plates. A solvent system of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:25:8:4, by volume) was used to resolve the phospholipid samples and hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v) to resolve the lipid samples (34Kishimoto K. Urade R. Ogawa T. Moriyama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The plates were sprayed with either phosphomolybdic acid or rhodamine B, and the RF values of substrates and cleavage products were determined. Preparation of Oxidized 1-Palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Oxidized PC)—Oxidized PC was prepared as described by Hattori et al. (35Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (4 μmol) in 1 ml of 90% acetate was mixed with 2 ml of an oxidation solution (24 mm KMnO4, 20 mm NaIO4), and the mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. Then lipids were extracted by the Bligh-Dyer method (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar), dried under a stream of N2, and resuspended in methanol. Computer Analysis—The multiple alignment of amino acid sequences was performed using Omiga (2.0). Blast search was performed using the program BLAST. The secondary structure was predicted using the method described by Pan (36Pan X. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 43: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The prediction of tertiary structure of the protein was carried out using the strategy of homologous sequence search at website of Swiss-Model (www.expasy.org/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL.html) or homologous secondary structure search in PDB Bank (www.rcsb.org/pdb/). Electrophoresis—Analysis of recombinant cell and calculation of molecular weight was performed using 12% acrylamide gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or silver-staining reagents. Molecular weight standards used were rabbit phosphorylase b, 97,400; bovine serum albumin, 66,200; rabbit actin, 43,000; bovine carbonic anhydrase, 31,000; trypsin inhibitor, 20,100; hen egg white lysozyme, 14,400. Identification of Minimal Functional Domain for CMPNeuAc Synthetase Activity—Several CSs have been isolated from both mammalian and bacterial sources (18Haft R.F. Wessels M.R. Mebane M.F. Conaty N.

Reglero A. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). According to their molecular size, these enzymes can be divided into two groups as follows: (i) those with molecular mass ranging 20-30 kDa and possessing 200-300 amino acids mostly come from bacterial species, such as 24.8 kDa from N. meningitidis; (ii) those with molecular mass ranging 40-60 kDa and possessing 400-500 amino acids mostly come from eukaryotic species. The second group has a molecular mass more than twice that of the first group. It is interesting to note, with a exception, that CSs from both E. coli and Helicobacter pylori belong to the second group. E. coli CS possesses 418 amino acid residues, which is almost twice of that of N. meningitidis (228 amino acids). Alignment of amino acid sequence of E. coli CS with that of N. meningitidis CS revealed that the highly conserved residues that are present in the active site, substrate-binding pocket, and dimerization domain could be found within the N-terminal half (1-210 amino acid residues) of E. coli CS (28Mosimann S.C.

We therefore hypothesized that the remaining residues in the C-terminal half were redundant. In order to verify our hypothesis, a series of mutant genes with deletion from 3′ termini were generated and subcloned into NcoI/BamHI sites of pET-15b. When the resulting plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells, the truncated enzymes CS210, CS213, CS221, CS229, CS246, CS283, CS339, and CS395 could be induced as soluble forms, which terminated at positions 210, 213, 221, 229, 246, 283, 339, and 395, respectively. The assay for CS activity showed that CS229, CS246, CS283, CS339, and CS395 were active, whereas no activity was detected with CS210, CS213, or CS221. The wild type and active mutants were partially purified (Fig. 1). As shown in Table II, the activities of CS395, CS339, and CS283 were 65, 38, and 31% of the wild type, respectively. CS246 showed 85% loss of activity, while removal of 17 additional C-terminal amino acids to produce CS229 resulted in a 3-fold increase of activity and showed 43% of activity of the wild type.Table IIActivity and specific activity of native and truncated CMP-NeuAc synthetase from E. coliEnzymeNo. amino acidsTheoretical molecular massSpecific activityRelative activity for each enzyme moleculekDaunits/mgunits/mmol, × 104%Wild type41848.60.90714.41100CS33939546.00.62202.8665CS39533939.40.42031.6638CS28328332.60.42341.3831CS24624628.50.22300.6415CS22922926.30.71351.8843 Open table in a new tab The highest activity for each active mutant occurred at 37 °C. CS229 even showed a slightly higher catalytic capacity than the wild type at 30 °C (data no shown).

https://openalex.org/W2074688004,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the committed step in fatty acid synthesis in all plants, animals, and bacteria. The Escherichia coli form is a multifunctional enzyme consisting of three separate proteins: biotin carboxylase, carboxyltransferase, and the biotin carboxyl carrier protein. The biotin carboxylase component, which catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of biotin using bicarbonate as the carboxylate source, has a homologous functionally identical subunit in the mammalian biotin-dependent enzymes propionyl-CoA carboxylase and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. In humans, mutations in either of these enzymes result in the metabolic deficiency propionic acidemia or methylcrotonylglycinuria. The lack of a system for structure-function studies of these two biotin-dependent carboxylases has prevented a detailed analysis of the disease-causing mutations. However, structural data are available for E. coli biotin carboxylase as is a system for its overexpression and purification. Thus, we have constructed three site-directed mutants of biotin carboxylase that are homologous to three missense mutations found in propionic acidemia or methylcrotonylglycinuria patients. The mutants M169K, R338Q, and R338S of E. coli biotin carboxylase were selected for study to mimic the disease-causing mutations M204K and R374Q of propionyl-CoA carboxylase and R385S of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. These three mutants were subjected to a rigorous kinetic analysis to determine the function of the residues in the catalytic mechanism of biotin carboxylase as well as to establish a molecular basis for the two diseases. The results of the kinetic studies have revealed the first evidence for negative cooperativity with respect to bicarbonate and suggest that Arg-338 serves to orient the carboxyphosphate intermediate for optimal carboxylation of biotin.

For over 20 years, site-directed mutagenesis has been used for determining the roles of active site residues in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. In designing such experiments, one is invariably faced with the question of which residue to mutate and to what to mutate this residue. Residues targeted for mutagenesis are usually identified using three-dimensional structural information or sequence alignments with homologous proteins, indicating which residues are highly conserved. Once the residues for mutagenesis are identified, they are commonly replaced with an isosteric residue or alanine (i.e. alanine-scanning mutagenesis) to minimize disruption of the protein structure. However, prior to the advent of site-directed mutagenesis, mutant human hemoglobins provided the only opportunity to study structure-function relationships in proteins. Many of these hemoglobinopathies involved amino acid replacements that would not normally be made using site-directed mutagenesis out of concern for disruption of the protein structure. Yet these mutations yielded important insight into how hemoglobin functioned (1Perutz M.F. Mechanisms of Cooperativity and Allosteric Regulation in Proteins. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1990Google Scholar). In this report, we take this classical approach to mutagenesis to examine the effect of three naturally occurring mutations found in biotin-dependent carboxylases on the catalytic mechanism of E. coli biotin carboxylase. Biotin carboxylase is one component of the multifunctional enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which catalyzes the first committed step in long chain fatty acid biosynthesis (2Wakil S.J. Stopps J.K. Joshi V.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is a biotin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the following two-step reaction as shown in Scheme 1. (1)Enzyme-biotin+Scheme 1 MgATP+HCO3-⇌Mg2+enzyme-biotin-CO2-+MgADP+Pi(2)Enzyme-biotin-CO2-+acetyl-CoA⇌malonyl-CoA+enzyme-biotin Biotin carboxylase catalyzes the first half-reaction, which is an ATP-dependent carboxylation of biotin to form carboxybiotin. Biotin is covalently attached to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein designated enzyme-biotin in Scheme 1. The second half-reaction is catalyzed by carboxyltransferase, which involves the transfer of the carboxyl group from carboxybiotin to acetyl-CoA to make malonyl-CoA. Animal acetyl-CoA carboxylase incorporates all three of these functions on a single polypeptide chain (3Tanabe T. Wada K. Okazaki T. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), whereas in the bacterial form, each function is a separate protein (4Cronan Jr., J.E. Waldrop G.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 407-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). There have been no documented naturally occurring mutations in acetyl-CoA carboxylase leading to an inborn error of metabolism. However, there are two related biotin-dependent carboxylases in which naturally occurring mutations have been detected. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase is involved in the catabolism of odd chain length fatty acids and branched chain amino acids, and mutations in the human form of this enzyme result in the condition propionic acidemia (5Ugarte M. Pérez-Cerdá C. Rodríguez-Pombo P. Desviat L.R. Pérez B. Richard E. Muro S. Campeau E. Ohura T. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The enzyme 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase is involved in the catabolism of leucine, and mutations in the human form of this enzyme result in methylcrotonylglycinuria (6Baumgartner M.R. Almashanu S. Suormala T. Obie C. Cole R.N. Packman S. Baumgartner E.R. Valle D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Both propionyl-CoA carboxylase and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase contain two different types of subunits and catalyze their respective reactions via a two-step reaction sequence similar to the reaction catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Scheme 1). In fact, the first half-reaction in Scheme 1, the carboxylation of biotin, is identical for all three enzymes. The biotin carboxylase subunits of propionyl-CoA carboxylase and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase are known as PCCα 1The abbreviations used are: PCC, propionyl-CoA carboxylase; MCC, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase; CbmP, carbamyl phosphate. and MCCα, respectively, whereas the carboxyltransferase functions are contained in the PCCβ and MCCβ subunits. Several disease-causing missense mutations have been identified in human propionyl-CoA carboxylase and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (5Ugarte M. Pérez-Cerdá C. Rodríguez-Pombo P. Desviat L.R.

Metab. 1999; 67: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), revealing that disease phenotypes can arise from mutations in either the α or β subunit. To date, characterization of the mutant proteins has included specific activity measurements of fibroblast extracts (8Clavero S. Martínez A. Pérez B. Pérez-Cerdá C. Ugarte M. Desviat L.R.

Alkhateeb A. Kraus J.P. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A useful model system for detailed analysis of mutations in the β subunit is provided by trans-carboxylase found in Propionibacterium shermanii. In particular, the PCCβ chain shares 50% sequence homology with the 12S subunit of transcarboxylase. Given the recent solution of the crystal structure of the 12S subunit, structure-function predictions may be made for the β subunit of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (11Hall P.R. Wang Y. Rivera-Hainaj R.E. Zheng X Pustai-Carey M. Carey P.R. Yee V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2334-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the PCCα subunit bears no sequence homology to the other subunits of trans-carboxylase, precluding this enzyme as a structural model for PCCα. However, the biotin carboxylase subunit of E. coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase provides an ideal model system to conduct a rigorous kinetic analysis of mutations found in the α subunits of propionyl-CoA carboxylase and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. In fact, 10 active site mutants of E. coli biotin carboxylase have been characterized to date (12Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Levert K.L. Lloyd R.B. Waldrop G.L.

Kinetic characterization of these naturally occurring mutants using E. coli biotin carboxylase as a model may lend insight into the structure and function of the enzyme. The advantage of using E. coli biotin carboxylase for kinetic analysis is that the homodimer can be isolated and retains catalytic activity in the absence of the other two components (15Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6633-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, biotin carboxylase is able to utilize free biotin as a substrate instead of biotin linked to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein, thereby simplifying kinetic analysis (15Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6633-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of structural information is perhaps the most significant feature of E. coli biotin carboxylase that makes it the paradigm for mechanistic studies of biotin-dependent enzymes. The x-ray crystal structure of biotin carboxylase has been solved and to date is the only structural model of a biotin-dependent carboxylase (16Waldrop G.L. Rayment I. Holden H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10249-10256Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17Thoden J.B. Blanchard C.Z. Holden H. Waldrop G.L. J. Biol.

Based on the three-dimensional structure, two mutations in the biotin carboxylase domain of human propionyl-CoA carboxylase, M204K and R374Q, were predicted to be in the active site (5Ugarte M. Pérez-Cerdá C. Rodríguez-Pombo P. Desviat L.R. Pérez B. Richard E. Muro S. Campeau E. Ohura T. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Campeau E. Dupuis L. León-Del-Rio A. Gravel R. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 67: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). According to sequence alignments of the human propionyl-CoA carboxylase and E. coli biotin carboxylase, the homologous residues in the E. coli enzyme are Met-169 and Arg-338 (Fig. 1). In patients with methylcrotonylglycinuria, only one mutation of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, R385S, was predicted to lie in the active site of the biotin carboxylase domain (6Baumgartner M.R. Almashanu S. Suormala T. Obie C. Cole R.N. Packman S. Baumgartner E.R. Valle D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this residue also corresponds to Arg-338 of E. coli biotin carboxylase (Fig. 1). In this report, these three mutations, M169K, R338Q, and R338S, were constructed in E. coli biotin carboxylase and the mutant enzymes were subjected to kinetic characterization. The results not only suggest a molecular basis for understanding how these mutations cause disease but also provide the first kinetic evidence for cooperativity between the subunits of E. coli biotin carboxylase. Chemicals and Enzymes—14C-labeled sodium bicarbonate was purchased from Amersham Biosciences and had a specific activity of 0.1 mCi/mmol. His Bind resin was purchased from Novagen. DEAE cellulose resin was manufactured by Whatman. Pyruvate kinase was obtained from Roche Applied Sciences. All of the other reagents were from Sigma or Aldrich. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Construction of biotin carboxylase mutants was performed by the PCR method of overlap extension as described by Blanchard et al. (12Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All of the primers were synthesized by Invitrogen. Mutagenic internal primers for the M169K, R338Q, and R338S mutants were used to incorporate the desired mutation. The mutagenic primer sequences were as follows: M169K, 5′-GCGCACTACGCGCTTACCGCGACCGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCGGTCGCGGTAAGCGCGTAGTGCGC-3′; R338Q, 5′-TTCGGCGTTGATTTGACATTCCACCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGGTGGAATGTCAAATCAACGCCGAA-3′; and R338S, 5′-TTCGGCGTTGATAGAACATTCCACCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGGTGGAATGTTCTATCAACGCCGAA-3′. The entire gene of each mutant was sequenced to confirm that only the desired mutation was incorporated. Overexpression and Purification of Biotin Carboxylase—The growth and overexpression of wild type and mutant biotin carboxylase was performed as described by Blanchard et al. (12Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Biotin carboxylase was purified by nickel affinity chromatography using His tag columns as described elsewhere (12Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the eluate from the His bind resin was dialyzed overnight against buffer A (10 mm NaCl, 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.1) and was then applied to a DEAE cellulose column. The column was washed with 14 volumes of buffer A. The flow-through and wash volumes were pooled, and the protein was precipitated by the addition of ammonium sulfate to 60% saturation. The precipitate was dissolved and dialyzed against 500 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. The resulting solution was then concentrated by vacuum dialysis using a collodion bag apparatus. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Kinetic Assays—The rate of ATP hydrolysis by biotin carboxylase was measured spectrophotometrically by coupling the formation of ADP to pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase and monitoring the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm. Each assay was conducted in the presence of 0.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.4 mm NADH, 23 units of pyruvate kinase, 35 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and 100 mm HEPES at pH 8. Because the Km for biotin is high (100 mm), the ionic strength was kept constant with KCl in assays where biotin was varied. The rate of ATP synthesis from Mg-ADP and carbamyl phosphate was measured spectrophotometrically. The formation of ATP was coupled to hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase while the reduction of NADP was followed at 340 nm. Each assay contained 0.5 mm glucose, 0.4 mm NADP, 5 units of hexokinase, 5 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 100 mm KCl, and 100 mm HEPES at pH 8. Initial velocities were measured using a Uvikon 810 spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments). All of the reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. Kinetic parameters were calculated per active site using a molecular mass of 50 kDa for the biotin carboxylase monomer (biotin carboxylase exists as a homodimer). The temperature of the reactions was maintained at 25or 37 °C by a circulating water bath. For assays conducted at 37 °C, all of the reaction components were preincubated for 6 min at 37 °C prior to mixing in quartz cuvettes. For each initial velocity measurement, the cuvette was preincubated in the spectrophotometer at 37 °C for 10 min before the addition of the reaction components. To determine whether there was a stoichiometric production of ADP and carboxybiotin, the amount of carboxybiotin produced by biotin carboxylase was determined using a 14C fixation assay and compared with the production of ADP as described elsewhere (12Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 20 mm ATP, 70 mm bicarbonate, 100 mm biotin, 50 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm HEPES at pH 8 in a total volume of 0.5 ml. Data Analysis—the Km and Vmax were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the velocity versus [substrate] data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. For assays in which the double reciprocal plots appeared hyperbolic, the data were fitted to Equation 1 where V1 and V2 are maximal velocities, Km1 and Km2 are Michaelis constants, and A is the substrate concentration. v=V1A/(Km1+A)+V2A/(Km2+A)(Eq. 1) Hill coefficients (nH) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the velocity versus [bicarbonate] data to Equation 2, v=Vmax[A]nH/K'+[A]nH(Eq. 2) where A is the substrate concentration and K′ is a constant that depends upon the interaction between substrate binding sites and the intrinsic dissociation constant of the enzyme-substrate complex. Bicarbonate-dependent ATPase Activity—The binding of substrate to biotin carboxylase is ordered with ATP binding first followed by bicarbonate and then biotin (18Blanchard C.Z. Amspacher D. Strongin R. Waldrop G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of biotin, the enzyme also catalyzes a slow bicarbonate-dependent ATP hydrolysis as shown in Scheme 2. MgATP+H2O⇌HCO3-MgADP+PiScheme 2 This reaction involves the transfer of the phosphate group to the bicarbonate, forming carboxyphosphate, which quickly breaks down into carbon dioxide and inorganic phosphate (19Climent I. Rubio V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). When ATP was varied at constant levels of bicarbonate, the kinetic parameters were determined for the three mutants and wild type. The Vmax values for the three mutants were only modestly different from the wild type enzyme. R338Q showed a 2-fold increase in Vmax, and R338S and M169K showed a 2-fold decrease or less (Table I). By contrast, the Km was strikingly affected by the R338Q and R338S mutations. Both Km values were elevated by at least 50-fold compared with wild type, suggesting the mutations have affected the binding affinity of ATP to the enzyme. The Km for the M169K mutant was only slightly higher (∼3-fold) than wild type.Table IKinetic parameters for the bicarbonate-dependent ATPase reactionKm ATPVmaxmmmin-1WTaData taken from Ref. 8.0.081 ± 0.0030.073 ± 0.001R338Q4.4 ± 0.30.16 ± 0.01R338S5.1 ± 0.50.045 ± 0.002M169K0.26 ± 0.020.033 ± 0.001a Data taken from Ref. 8Clavero S.

Open table in a new tab Interestingly, when ATP was held constant and bicarbonate varied, the double reciprocal plots were hyperbolic for all three mutants (Fig. 2). All three mutants exhibited significant increases in velocity at higher concentrations of bicarbonate, suggesting substrate activation, also known as negative cooperativity. Negative cooperativity with respect to bicarbonate means that the binding of bicarbonate to one subunit of the biotin carboxylase homodimer decreases the affinity of the second subunit for bicarbonate. When the data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, the difference in the observed and the calculated values revealed a distinct pattern on a residual plot. A nonrandom residual plot indicates that the data are not accurately described by the Michaelis-Menten equation. By contrast, fitting the data to the equation for negative cooperativity (Equation 1) revealed the residuals to be random. A representative example of this type of analysis is shown in Fig. 3 for the M169K mutant. The fitting to Equation 1 also revealed that the Km for each of the mutants was greater than 30 mm. For this reason, the Km values for ATP shown in Table I are apparent Km values because saturating levels of bicarbonate could not be achieved.Fig. 3Residuals for the M169K mutant. Plots show the observed velocities minus the calculated velocities for data for the M169K mutant fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (A) and Equation 1 (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Particularly intriguing is the fact that the degree of negative cooperativity by bicarbonate for the three mutants is dependent upon the concentration of biotin. To illustrate this trend, the Hill coefficients (nH) under different concentrations of biotin are listed in Table II. In the presence of 60 mm biotin, M169K showed a slight 23% increase in nH relative to the reaction without biotin. The R338S and R338Q mutants displayed a more dramatic increase in nH (3- and 5-fold, respectively) with 60 mm biotin as opposed to 16 mm biotin. These trends indicate that biotin decreases the negative cooperativity of the three mutants, particularly for the two Arg-338 mutants. Assaying the two Arg-338 mutants in the absence of biotin proved difficult because the enzymes displayed almost no change in rate when bicarbonate was varied.Table IIHill coefficients for the three mutants of biotin carboxylase[Biotin]nHmmR338Q160.17 ± 0.03600.79 ± 0.07R338S160.20 ± 0.03600.58 ± 0.05M169K00.29 ± 0.02600.38 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab Biotin-dependent ATPase Activity—The rate of ATP hydrolysis is increased 1100-fold in the presence of biotin for the wild type enzyme (12Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, when the hydrolysis of ATP was assayed in the presence of biotin for the three mutants, the most notable result was that the Vmax of R338S and R338Q was 700- and 100-fold lower than wild type, respectively (Table III). The Vmax was also reduced in the M169K mutant but only by ∼10-fold. The Km for biotin for R338Q was virtually unchanged from that of wild type. The R338S and M169K mutants, however, showed a 5- and 2.5-fold reduction in apparent Km, respectively. Although the latter two mutants seem to bind biotin with slightly greater affinity than wild type, it is important to note that the catalytic efficiency (V/K) is 5-fold lower for M169K and 140-fold lower for R338S. Again, the Km for the three mutants reported here are apparent Km values because it was not possible to saturate the enzymes with bicarbonate.Table IIIKinetic parameters for the Biotin-dependent ATPase reactionKm biotinVmaxV/Kmmmin-1mm-1min-1WTaData taken from Ref. 8.134 ± 1479 ± 30.59 ± 0.08R338Q143 ± 210.74 ± 0.050.0052 ± 0.0004R338S25 ± 20.10 ± 0.010.0041 ± 0.0003M169K56 ± 66.7 ± 0.30.12 ± 0.01a Data taken from Ref. 8Clavero S.

Open table in a new tab Although the assay for the ATPase activity measures the rate of production of ADP using a continuous assay, the production of carboxybiotin cannot be followed. Thus, the assay cannot detect whether ATP hydrolysis is uncoupled from the production of carboxybiotin in the mutants. However, carboxybiotin can be quantified to demonstrate whether it is produced at a 1:1 stoichiometry with ADP. Wild type biotin carboxylase and M169K both exhibited a normal 1:1 ratio of ADP to carboxybiotin production (Table IV). Unexpectedly, however, R338S and R338Q revealed ratios of 3.0 and 3.8, respectively. This conspicuous perturbation in the stoichiometry suggests that for the two Arg-338 mutants, the carboxylation of biotin is uncoupled from ATP hydrolysis. Of the 10 site-directed mutants of biotin carboxylase characterized to date, only one other, K238Q, has exhibited such an uncoupling (13Levert K.L. Lloyd R.B. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4122-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Table IVRatio of ADP to carboxybiotin productionWTaData taken from Ref. 10.0.96 ± 0.18R338Q3.8 ± 0.1R338S3.0 ± 0.1M169K1.0 ± 0.1a Data taken from Ref. 10Chloupkova M.

Open table in a new tab ATP Synthesis Activity—E. coli biotin carboxylase is known to catalyze the formation of ATP from ADP and carbamyl phosphate as shown in Scheme 3. MgADP+carbamylphosphate⇌MgATP+carbamateScheme 3 The carbamate molecule rapidly decomposes to carbon dioxide and ammonia. This reaction mimics the reverse of the physiological reaction with carbamyl phosphate acting as a carboxyphosphate analog. Note that the ATP synthesis reaction does not include biotin, although biotin does stimulate the rate of ADP phosphorylation (12Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The three mutations do not appear to have markedly altered the kinetics of the ATP synthesis reaction (Table V). The only dissimilarity to wild type kinetics was exhibited by the two Arg-338 mutants. R338S had a Vmax reduced by 2-fold and a Km ADP increased by 2-fold. R338Q displayed a 3-fold increase in Km ADP, a 2-fold decrease in Km CbmP, and a 5-fold increase in Vmax.Table VKinetic parameters for the ATP synthesis reactionKm CbmPKm ADPVmaxmmmin-1WTaData taken from Ref. 9.4.8 ± 0.20.19 ± 0.010.31 ± 0.01R338Q2.4 ± 0.20.65 ± 0.051.47 ± 0.04R338S6.9 ± 0.90.39 ± 0.040.14 ± 0.01M169K3.6 ± 0.60.14 ± 0.010.22 ± 0.01a Data taken from Ref. 9Desviat L.R.

Open table in a new tab The degree of stimulation of the phosphoryl transfer by biotin was also compared for wild type and the three mutants. The rate of ATP synthesis was examined with and without 60 mm biotin (Table VI).

Open table in a new tab Effect of Temperature on Activity—Clearly, it seems that the diseases caused by the three homologous mutations of human biotin-dependent carboxylases are attributable, at least in part, to their decreased activity. The impaired Vmax of the biotin-dependent ATPase reaction by the homologous biotin carboxylase mutants corroborates this notion. However, because the assays on the biotin carboxylase mutants were carried out at 25 °C, denaturation of the protein structure at body temperature (37 °C) could not be ruled out. Thus, the biotin-dependent ATPase reaction was carried out at 37 °C for R338Q, R338S, and M169K. Compared with the data collected at 25 °C, the Vmax at 37 °C was 2-fold higher for both wild type and R338Q. R338S displayed a 3-fold increase in Vmax at 37 °C, whereas M169K displayed a 7-fold increase. Because the activity of the three mutants increased at 37 °C, it can be surmised that the overall protein structure was not damaged by the physiological temperature and that the kinetics observed for the mutants are representative of those in vivo. This assertion is further confirmed by Western blot analysis of fibroblast extracts from patients carrying the mutations M204K and R385S. Biotin carboxylase subunits of propionyl-CoA carboxylase were detected in the patient fibroblasts with the M204K mutation (7Campeau E. Dupuis L. León-Del-Rio A. Gravel R. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 67: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Biotin carboxylase subunits of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase were also detected in patient fibroblasts carrying the R385S mutation (6Baumgartner M.R. Almashanu S. Suormala T. Obie C. Cole R.N. Packman S. Baumgartner E.R. Valle D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The presence of these proteins also argues against any intrinsic instability and subsequent degradation of the enzyme due to the mutations. In this report, we used naturally occurring mutations of biotin-dependent carboxylases to identify active site residues of E. coli biotin carboxylase for mutational analysis. The fact that these mutations result in metabolic diseases in humans suggests that the homologous mutants in E. coli biotin carboxylase will have altered kinetics that provide insight into the mechanism of the enzyme as well as determine the molecular basis of the diseases. Indeed, these naturally occurring mutants revealed two important observations concerning the mechanism of catalysis. The most striking result was that all three mutants of E. coli biotin carboxylase exhibited negative cooperativity with respect to the substrate bicarbonate. This is the first evidence that one of the natural substrates exhibits cooperative behavior in E. coli biotin carboxylase and substantiates previous work suggesting that the two subunits communicate (12Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Janiyani K. Bordelon T. Waldrop G.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29864-29870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The first evidence for communication between the two subunits of E. coli biotin carboxylase was that an active site mutant, N290A, exhibited negative cooperativity with respect to carbamyl phosphate in a slow nonphysiological reaction where the phosphate group is transferred to ADP to make ATP (12Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, carbamyl phosphate is an analog of the reaction intermediate carboxyphosphate, which is the phosphorylated form of bicarbonate. A more compelling case for communication between the subunits involved making hybrid dimers of biotin carboxylase where one subunit had a wild type active site while the other subunit contained an active site mutation known to significantly decrease the activity of the enzyme (20Janiyani K. Bordelon T. Waldrop G.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29864-29870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The active sites of the enzyme are not at the interface between the two subunits (16Waldrop G.L. Rayment I. Holden H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10249-10256Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). That is, the active sites are not composed of residues from both subunits (also referred to as a shared active site). Kinetic analyses of four hybrid dimers had Vmax values that were 0.4–3.6% of the Vmax value for dimers composed of two wild type subunits. Thus, the two subunits of biotin carboxylase do not function independently. If the two subunits acted independently, the Vmax values of the hybrids would have been approximately half of the Vmax of the wild type enzyme. All four mutations exhibited a dominant negative effect on the function of the wild type active site, suggesting that there is communication between the subunits. The observation of negative cooperativity in the N290A, R338S, R338Q, and M169K mutants is consistent with the notion of communication between the subunits and substantiates the possibility that the binding of substrate to one subunit affects the kinetics of the other subunit. The fact that a point mutation results in cooperative behavior suggests that multisubunit proteins are teetering between cooperative and noncooperative behavior. There are numerous examples of single amino acid substitutions bestowing cooperativity or abolishing cooperativity in proteins. Examples are found in hemoglobin (1Perutz M.F. Mechanisms of Cooperativity and Allosteric Regulation in Proteins. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1990Google Scholar), aspartate transcarbamylase (21Eisenstein E. Markby D.W. Schachman H.K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3724-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), pyruvate kinase (22Ikeda Y. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20495-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the aspartate receptor (23Kolodziej A.F. Tan T. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14782-14792Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Given the precarious balance between cooperative and noncooperative behavior, is the negative cooperativity observed here simply an artifact of the mutations or does it provide any insight into the function of the enzyme? It is tempting to speculate that the mutant forms of biotin carboxylase that exhibit negative cooperativity represent evolutionary relics. This notion is supported by noting that the composition of the early atmosphere contained high levels of carbon dioxide (24Lazcano A. Miller S.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 793-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Negative cooperativity was detected only with respect to bicarbonate, not ATP or biotin. Negative cooperativity with respect to bicarbonate could have conferred an evolutionary advantage to the organism by decreasing the sensitivity of the enzyme to bicarbonate concentration. This would allow the enzyme to be active over a broader range of bicarbonate concentrations than would be allowed by Michaelis-Menten kinetics (25Koshland Jr., D.E. Hamadani K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46841-46844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As the level of CO2 in the environment stabilized, negative cooperativity of biotin carboxylase would have ceased to confer any advantage for the organism. Thus, the gene coding for the enzyme would mutate to create an enzyme obeying Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In addition to negative cooperativity, the two Arg-338 mutants (R338Q and R338S) revealed that arginine plays a significant role in carboxyl transfer to biotin. The 3:1 ratio of ADP produced to carboxybiotin produced indicates that cleavage of ATP is uncoupled from carboxyl transfer to biotin. What function could Arg-338 serve in the chemistry of carboxyl transfer? One possibility would be to abstract the N1′ proton from biotin to allow for carboxylation. However, finding an active site residue that acts as a catalytic base in biotin carboxylase has been unsuccessful to date despite the mutation of 10 active site amino acids. Furthermore, there is virtually no precedent for an arginine acting as a general base in enzymic reactions. An alternate explanation of the role of Arg-338 begins with the work of Levert et al. (13Levert K.L. Lloyd R.B. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4122-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) who implicate Lys-238 as an essential residue in the production of carboxybiotin. Similar to the Arg-338 mutants, mutation of Lys-238 resulted in uncoupling of ATP hydrolysis and biotin carboxylation. It is interesting to note that of all of the site-directed mutants of biotin carboxylase that have been characterized, only mutations of Lys-238 and Arg-338 have resulted in the uncoupling of ATP hydrolysis and biotin carboxylation. Lys-238 acting as a catalytic base was ruled out because the pKa value was found to be greater than 9.5. The Km for ATP for K238Q was 50-fold higher than that of wild type, whereas the Km for ADP was only 5-fold higher. Similarly, R338Q and R338S displayed a 50-fold increase in the Km for ATP along with a modest 3-fold increase in the Km for ADP. Given the similarity in kinetics between K238Q and the two Arg-338 mutants, it is likely that their catalytic roles are similar. Since Levert et al. (13Levert K.L. Lloyd R.B. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4122-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) concluded that Lys-238 interacted with the γ-phosphate of ATP, it may be inferred that Arg-338 also interacts with the γ-phosphate. Levert et al. (13Levert K.L. Lloyd R.B. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4122-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) went on to conclude that if Lys-238 binds to the γ-phosphate group of ATP and in turn binds the phosphate group of carboxyphosphate, Lys-238 may help orient the phosphate group to act as a base for extraction of the proton from the 1′-nitrogen of biotin. Thus, Arg-338 may act in concert with Lys-238 in the alignment of the phosphate group of carboxyphosphate to carry out substrate-assisted catalysis, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Although this model seems inconsistent with the observation that the Km for CbmP (a carboxyphosphate analog) for the two Arg-338 mutants was not significantly different from that of wild type, it should be noted that CbmP is not the physiological substrate. In fact, the amide nitrogen of CbmP can act as a hydrogen bond donor, whereas the carboxyl oxygen of carboxyphosphate can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor. The fact that CbmP can have different hydrogen bonding properties may cause it to be positioned differently from carboxyphosphate in the active site. Thus, although CbmP is an analog of a physiological intermediate, it may not exactly mimic the binding of carboxyphosphate. Does the kinetic analysis of the mutants found in patients with propionic acidemia and methylcrotonylglycinuria correlate with the clinical phenotype? The patient with the mutation M204K in propionyl-CoA carboxylase exhibited normal growth and development when treated with a protein-restricted diet (26Brandt I.K. Hsia Y.E. Clement D.H. Provence S.A. Pediatrics. 1974; 53: 391-395PubMed Google Scholar). This mild clinical phenotype is consistent with the observation that the overall function of the homologous mutation in E. coli biotin carboxylase (M169K) did not severely cripple the enzyme. The mutant enzyme had a maximal velocity 10% of the wild type value and exhibited negative cooperativity with respect to bicarbonate. However, all of the other aspects of the kinetics of the M169K mutant were close to wild type and, most importantly, the ratio of ADP to carboxybiotin production was 1:1. This is in contrast to the R338S mutant, which showed a decreased production of carboxybiotin relative to ADP and a maximal velocity that was 100-fold less than the wild type value. The fact that the R338S mutation resulted in a defective E. coli biotin carboxylase is consistent with the severe phenotype exhibited by the patient carrying the homologous mutation (R385S) in 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (6Baumgartner M.R. Almashanu S. Suormala T. Obie C. Cole R.N. Packman S. Baumgartner E.R. Valle D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Steen C. Baumgartner E.R. Duran M. Lehnert W. Suormala T. Fingerhut R. Stehn M. Kohlschütter A. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1999; 158: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The clinical phenotype of the patient with the mutation R374Q in propionyl-CoA carboxylase was not available. It is important to note that although the M169K and R338S mutations both reduced the Vmax, neither mutation completely abolished the carboxylation of biotin. Likewise, the residual activity of the homologous mutant carboxylases in both patients was sufficient to allow compensation for the deficiency through a modified diet (26Brandt I.K. Hsia Y.E. Clement D.H. Provence S.A. Pediatrics. 1974; 53: 391-395PubMed Google Scholar, 27Steen C. Baumgartner E.R. Duran M. Lehnert W. Suormala T. Fingerhut R. Stehn M. Kohlschütter A. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1999; 158: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). By decreasing the flux of metabolites through the amino acid catabolic pathway, the buildup of toxic intermediates can be reduced. However, the severity of the two phenotypes was quite different, reflecting the importance of the individual roles of the two mutated residues. Despite the protein-restricted diet, the patient carrying the R385S mutation sustained irreversible brain damage and delayed development. In contrast, the patient carrying the M204K mutation had normal growth and development. Thus, the classical approach of studying naturally occurring disease-causing mutations in proteins allows genotype-phenotype correlations to be made."

Furthermore, overnight exposure to the phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate and acute incubation with inhibitors of the conventional protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms bisindolylmaleimide I and Gö6976 inhibited GCl,swell.

Cells undergo dynamic changes in volume in response to different stimuli, including variations in extracellular tonicity. Upon cell swelling by exposure to hypotonic conditions, transport pathways for organic osmolytes as well as K+ and Cl- channels are activated and accompanied by movement of water to the external medium in a process known as regulatory volume decrease (RVD) 1The abbreviations used are: RVD, regulatory volume decrease; GCl,swell, swelling-activated chloride conductance; PKC, protein kinase C; TPA, tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate; PLC, phospholipase C; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; BIM-1, bisindolylmaleimide I; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; NMDG, N-methyl d-glucamine; PP1, 4-amino-1-tertbutyl-3-(1′-naphthyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine; GFP, green fluorescent protein.

A remarkable exception is the kidney medulla, where extracellular osmolarity exceeds isotonicity by >4-fold. Less dramatic changes of extracellular osmolarity occur during intestinal absorption, which exposes intestinal cells to anisosmotic luminal fluid. Even at constant extracellular osmolarity cell volume is compromised by alterations of intracellular osmolarity. Several metabolic pathways lead to cellular formation or degradation of osmotically active substances. Furthermore, transport across the cell membrane modifies cellular osmolarity and, thus, cell volume (for review, see Ref. 2Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Völkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Häussinger D. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). In addition, cell volume changes have important physiological roles as integral components of the signal transduction events involved in diverse processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, exocytosis, and neuronal excitability (3Hoffmann E.K. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 273-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4Rizoli S.B. Rotstein O.D. Parodo J. Phillips M.J. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C619-C633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under pathological conditions cell swelling has been also observed, namely during correction of extracellular acidosis in the course of the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (5Van der Meulen J.A. Klip A. Grinstein S. Lancet. 1987; 2: 306-308Abstract PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although the precise mediators and pathways that connect cell swelling to the activation of GCl,swell and, thus, RVD remain largely unidentified. Possible mechanisms involved include cytosolic changes in ionic strength, macromolecular crowding (6Voets T. Droogmans G. Raskin G. Eggermont J. Nilius B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5298-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 7Colclasure C.G. Parker J.C. J. Gen.

Rev. 1992; 72: 1037-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In addition to Ca2+ other intracellular components, such as ATP (9Miley H.E. Brown P.D. Best L. J.

Physiol. 1999; 516: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), have been implicated as mediators of GCl,swell in certain cell types. Protein phosphorylation also plays a role in the modulation of GCl,swell. Activation of GCl,swell by tyrosine kinases has been shown to occur in some cells, such as cardiac myocytes (12Sadoshima J. Qiu Z. Morgan J.P. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5535-5546Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), H4IIE hepatoma cells (13Schliess F. Schreiber R. Haussinger D. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and I407 cells (14Tilly B.C. Gaestel M. Engel K. Edixhoven M.J. de Jonge H.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In various cell types protein kinase Cs (PKCs) appear involved in modulating GCl,swell (15Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 16Chou C.Y. Shen M.R. Hsu K.S. Huang H.Y. Lin H.C. J.

Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In Ehrlich ascites tumor cells PKCs were found to be activated in the later phases of RVD, and it was suggested that PKCs may play a role in terminating the RVD response, presumably by modulating the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (18Larsen A.K. Jensen B.S. Hoffmann E.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The PKC family includes at least 11 members that are generally classified in three categories based on cofactor requirements for activation and sequence homologies. Conventional Ca2+-dependent PKCs (cPKCs) are activated by DAG in the presence of Ca2+, whereas novel PKCs are Ca2+-independent. Both groups are, however, activated by phorbol esters. In contrast, atypical PKCs are neither activated by DAG nor by phorbol esters (19Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar, 20Jaken S. Curr. Opin.

HeLa cells have been extensively used as a model to study RVD (25Díaz M. Valverde M.A. Higgins C.F. Rucareanu C. Sepúlveda F.V. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 422: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Stutzin A. Eguiguren A.L. Cid L.P. Sepúlveda F.V. Am. J.

Physiol. 1999; 277: C392-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, thus, are well suited to address questions concerning the role of PKCs and the signal transduction cascades involved in GCl,swell activation. Here, we examined the effect of PKCs on GCl,swell by monitoring in intact cells the time course of activation of the volume-activated Cl- conductance. Because conditions under which patch clamp whole-cell recordings are carried out are significantly different from intact cell experiments, we have pursued this question using an intactcell technique (27Stutzin A. Torres R. Oporto M. Pacheco P. Eguiguren A.L. Cid L.P. Sepúlveda F.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C392-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments described here established the importance of both extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ for GCl,swell activation in HeLa cells. In addition, PKCs were implicated by pharmacological manipulation with inhibitors, and a role for PKCα was inferred from translocation experiments. To specifically determine the contribution of PKCα to GCl,swell activation, HeLa cell lines stably expressing either dominant negative PKCα (K386R) or PKCζ (K275W) were generated and studied. Hypotonicity-induced GCl,swell was found to be severely impaired in all lines expressing dominant negative PKCα (K386R), whereas the presence of PKCζ (K275W) had no effect. These results implicate PKCα as an important regulatory element controlling RVD in HeLa cells. Cells—HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5–95% CO2-air atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 80,000 IU/liter penicillin, and 50 μg/liter streptomycin. Western Blot Analysis—The presence of the different wild type PKC isoforms and expression of the dominant negative PKCα (K386R) and PKCζ (K275W) mutants was determined by Western blot analysis using either PKC isoform-specific or His6-tag-specific antibodies, respectively. Cells were lysed and sonicated in a minimal volume of lysis buffer (containing 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trasylol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) and centrifuged. Protein content of cell lysates was determined by the Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Proteins in whole-cell lysates were dissolved in sample buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE in 8% gels, and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose as described (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding sites of the membrane were blocked using 5% nonfat milk in 0.05 m Trisbuffered saline, pH 7.2. PKC isoforms in HeLa cells were identified using different dilutions of mouse monoclonal antibodies against PKC α, δ, ϵ (Transduction Laboratories, KY) or rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PKC β2, θ, η, and ζ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), as previously described (31Gómez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44944-44952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A mouse polyclonal antibody against a His6-tagged salmon fusion protein (BiosChile, Santiago, Chile) was used to identify expression of PKC mutant isoforms in transfected HeLa cells. Non-specifically bound antibody was removed by washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Specific PKC and His6 reactivity were determined using either peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti mouse or goat-anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories). The peroxidase activity was detected using the ECL chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and revealed by exposure to x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Immunoreactive bands present on the films were scanned. Intensity values were obtained after scanning densitometry of individual bands with Scion-Image (NIH) software. Down-regulation of PKC—In PKC down-regulation studies cells were incubated for 24 h with 1 μm TPA in the culture medium. Control cells were incubated with the vehicle Me2SO (0.1%) for 24 h. Subcellular Fractionation and Preparation of Cell Extracts—For subcellular fractionation studies, about 107 cells were exposed to 30% hypotonic medium for 5 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol, and a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (leupeptin, NaF, pepstatin, Na3VO4, benzamidine, Na4P2O7, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Analysis of PKC Translocation by Cell Fractionation—Cells were homogenized by pipetting 30 times through a 25-gauge needle and centrifuged at 280 × g for 10 min to eliminate nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100000 × g for 1 h. The resulting soluble supernatant (cytosolic) fraction was stored at -80 °C, whereas the residual pellet was resuspended in the same buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, sonicated for 1 min, and stored at -80 °C (particulate fraction). Before Western blot analysis the protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein (100 μg) were loaded per lane and separated by SDS-PAGE as described above. In Situ Analysis of PKC Translocation Using GFP-tagged Proteins— HeLa cells were plated on glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) 1 day before liposome-mediated transfection with LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) of the PKCα-GFP or PKCζ-GFP construct (BD Biosciences and Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, respectively). Half a microgram of each plasmid and 3 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 were used for 5.5 × 104 cells. After 4 h in the presence of LipofectAMINE, cells were transferred to normal medium for 24–28 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and maintained in isotonic solution. The fluorescence-imaging experiments in live cells were performed at room temperature (20–25 °C). Images were obtained using a laser-scanning confocal system coupled to a 510 Zeiss microscope with an immersion objective (40×, 1.2 numerical aperture) and subsequently analyzed with the software ImageJ, version 1.30p (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) to determine relative PKC-GFP intensity distribution. Cells were imaged either under isotonic conditions (control) after exposure to 30% hypotonicity or after TPA treatment. Construction of HeLa Cell Lines Stably Expressing either PKCα or PKCζ Dominant Negative Mutants—HeLa cells were stably transfected with a bovine PKCα Lys/Arg368 and PKCζ Lys/Trp275 cDNA mutant containing a His6 tag at the COOH terminus subcloned into the cytomegalovirus expression vector pEF-neo (32Baier-Bitterlich G. Uberall F. Bauer B. Fresser F. Wachter H. Grunicke H. Utermann G. Altman A. Baier G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE as indicated by the manufacturer (Invitrogen), and clones were selected with 200 μg/ml G418 in the culture medium. Cell Volume Measurements—Changes in cell water volume of individual cells were assessed by measuring variations in the concentration of an intracellularly trapped fluorescent dye as previously described (27Stutzin A. Torres R. Oporto M. Pacheco P. Eguiguren A.L. Cid L.P. Sepúlveda F.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C392-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. Altamirano J. Crowe W.E. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 27: 361-391Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were loaded with 5 μm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 5 min and then superfused with an iso-osmotic solution for 15 min before subjecting the cells to hypotonicity. Changes in fluorescence were monitored using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope as previously described. Images were obtained at 10-s intervals, and the fluorescence of a 10-μm2 area in the center of a cell was measured. The data are presented as Vt/V0 values, where V0 is the cell water volume in iso-osmotic solution at time 0, and Vt is the cell water volume at time t. Vt/V0 was calculated from the fluorescence intensity ratio F0/Ft as described (33Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. Altamirano J. Crowe W.E. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 27: 361-391Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cell Calcium Measurements—Relative changes in intracellular Ca2+ were assessed by measuring variations in the fluorescence of the Ca2+-sensitive dye Rhod-2 (Molecular Probes) (34Minta A. Kao J.P. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8171-8178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells attached to glass coverslips were loaded for 20–40 min at 37 °C with saline containing the acetoxymethyl ester of the dye (Rhod-2AM, final concentration, 5.2 μm and 0.1% pluronic acid). Coverslips were placed at the bottom of a 1-ml capacity chamber and submerged initially in an iso-osmotic solution. Fluorescence changes at emission wavelength 570 nm, as a consequence of exposure to hypotonic conditions, were measured using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope and an excitation wavelength of 543 nm. Images were scanned every 10 s. The images were analyzed off-line with ImageJ, version 1.30p. The relative fluorescence intensity ratio (Ft/F0) is expressed as a function of time. Solutions—The iso-osmotic solution contained 100 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 2 mmol/liter CaCl2, 10 mmol/liter, glucose, and 10 mmol/liter HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris, and mannitol to yield a final osmolarity of 310 mosmol/liter. The hypoosmotic NaCl solution had the same composition as the iso-osmotic solution without mannitol (210 mosmol/liter). The hypoosmotic NMDG-Cl solution contained 100 mmol/liter NMDG-Cl, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 2 mmol/liter CaCl2, 10 mmol/liter glucose, and 10 mmol/liter HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris. Gramicidin (10 μm) (Sigma) was added to the NMDG-Cl hypoosmotic solution as previously described (27Stutzin A. Torres R. Oporto M. Pacheco P. Eguiguren A.L. Cid L.P. Sepúlveda F.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C392-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mannitol was omitted, yielding an osmolarity of 210 mosmol/liter. Statistical Analysis—Statistical differences of the data were evaluated by unpaired Student's t test and considered significant at p < 0.05. Reagents and Treatments—The phorbol ester TPA (Sigma), Gö6976, BIM-1, U-73122, BAPTA-AM (all from Calbiochem) were dissolved in Me2SO (final Me2SO concentration never exceeded 0.1% in the culture medium) and stored at -20 °C for up to 1 month. In all cases cells were preincubated in the presence of the different PKC modulators (20 nm TPA, 500 nm BIM-1, or 100 nm Gö6976), the PLC inhibitor U73122 (1 μm), the IP3 receptor blocker 2-aminoethoxydiphenil borate (50 μm), and thapsigargin (1 μm) for 30 min. Cells were then exposed to hypotonicity, and volume or Ca2+ changes were measured. Inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem and Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma, Aldrich, or Merck. Expression of Protein Kinase C Isoforms in HeLa Cells—PKC isozymes expressed in HeLa cells were detected as bands of the predicted molecular weights by Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates using isotype-specific antibodies against PKCα, -β2, -δ, -ϵ, -η, and -ζ (Fig. 1). Bands observed in HeLa cell extracts comigrated with the corresponding bands detected in tissue extracts employed as controls for each PKC isotype (brain for -α,-β2,-δ, and -ζ; skeletal muscle for -ϵ,-η, and -θ). The isozyme PKCθ was not detected in HeLa cell lysates under the experimental conditions used. These results indicate that at least one isoform of each PKC subgroup (cPKCs, novel PKCs, and atypical PKCs) was expressed in HeLa cells. GCl,swell in HeLa Cells Is Ca2+-dependent and Blocked by TPA—Calcium has been shown to be an intracellular mediator or potentiator of hypotonicity-induced GCl,swell in some cells, in particular epithelial cells (1Hoffmann E.K. Dunham P.B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 161: 173-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 3Hoffmann E.K. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 273-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of Ca2+ on GCl,swell was explored next. Under control conditions, cells rapidly swelled after exposure to a 30% hypotonic NaCl solution (Fig. 2). GCl,swell was monitored by switching to a hypotonic NMDG-Cl solution containing 10 μm of the cation-selective ionophore gramicidin (27Stutzin A. Torres R. Oporto M. Pacheco P. Eguiguren A.L. Cid L.P. Sepúlveda F.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C392-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rationale of this experimental procedure is to make Cl- conductance rate-limiting for net ion transport across the plasma membrane. This is achieved by replacement of all monovalent cations in the medium by the impermeant cation NMDG and the addition of gramicidin. Under these conditions the conductance of the membrane is dominated by the K+ permeability and, should a Cl- conductance be present, the cell will shrink at a rate proportional to anion permeability (27Stutzin A. Torres R. Oporto M. Pacheco P. Eguiguren A.L. Cid L.P. Sepúlveda F.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C392-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon exposure to a 30% hypotonic solution the cells immediately swelled, indicating that cell volume was adequately monitored in these experiments. Under these experimental conditions, cells typically displayed excessive volume recovery (control trace in Fig. 2), a fact that may be explained by the absence of an appropriate ion gradient for the Na+-K+-2Cl- transporter in Na+-free medium. HeLa cells were preloaded with 100 μm BAPTA-AM to deplete bulk cytoplasmic free Ca2+. Under these conditions GCl,swell was markedly retarded as compared with control cells (Fig. 2 and Table I). Different sets of experiments were conducted to identify the origin of Ca2+. The participation of extracellular Ca2+ in GCl,swell was studied by removal of the divalent cation from the medium. As depicted (Fig. 2), this treatment impaired GCl,swell to a similar degree as seen in the BAPTA-loaded cells. The role of intracellular Ca2+ was addressed by long term preincubation of cells with 1 μm thapsigargin in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. These conditions (Table I) reduced GCl,swell to a similar extent as seen when Ca2+ was omitted from the medium, indicating that Ca2+ of intra- and extracellular origin regulate the rate of hypotonicity-induced GCl,swell in HeLa cells.Table IEffect of different compounds and PKCα and PKCζ dominant negative mutants on GCl,swell in HeLa cells Maximal Vt/V0 corresponds to the normalized maximal volume (Vt/V0) reached after hypotonic challenge for control cells. This parameter was not significantly different between control and treated cells. Volume at 10 min represents the normalized volume (Vt/V0) measured 10 min after switching from iso- to hypotonic conditions whereby control cells are compared with those treated with the inhibitors indicated.

A 30% decrease in extracellular hypotonicity in a Ca2+-containing hypo-osmotic medium triggered a biphasic Ca2+ response. The rapid more transient component terminated within 5–6 min, whereas the slower sustained component was maintained up to 10–12 min. Upon removal of extracellular Ca2+, only the faster transient component was retained but displayed slightly slower kinetics and a smaller amplitude. After a 30-min exposure to 1 μm thapsigargin in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+, hypotonicity failed to produce any significant variation in intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3). Peak fluorescence intensity of the rapid component in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ was 1.54 ± 0.02, compared with 1.31 ± 0.01 in the absence of Ca2+. Fluorescence intensity for the slower component was 1.28 ± 0.05 in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ compared with 1.01 ± 0.02 in the absence of Ca2+ (inset in Fig. 3). Long term incubation with TPA has been shown previously to down-regulate cPKC and novel PKC protein levels by promoting proteolytic degradation. This often occurs at different rates for individual isoforms (19Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of overnight exposure of HeLa cells to 1 μm TPA on GCl,swell. As suspected, cell volume recovery was significantly delayed in TPA-treated cells upon hypotonic challenge (Fig. 2 and Table I), suggesting that TPA-sensitive PKC(s) regulated GCl,swell in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis of HeLa cells after overnight incubation with TPA revealed a significant decrease in PKCα protein levels. Scanning densitometry analysis of PKCα before and after TPA treatment confirmed that PKCα levels were reduced by at least 50%, whereas PKCζ levels remained essentially unaltered (Fig. 4, A and B). Hypotonicity Induced Translocation of PKCα to the Particulate Fraction of HeLa Cells—PKC activation is often associated with PKC translocation to the plasma membrane. To investigate this possibility cells were initially fractionated as described, and the presence of PKCs in the particulate (membrane) fraction was assayed by Western blotting. Brief (5 min) exposure of HeLa cells to hypotonic conditions resulted in an increase by 47.5 ± 4.7% of PKCα in the particulate fraction, whereas no changes were observed for PKCζ (Fig. 5, A and B). Hypotonicity Induced Translocation of GFP-PKCα to the Plasma Membrane of HeLa Cells—The results above demonstrated that PKCα specifically altered its intracellular distribution in response to hypoosmotic cell swelling and accumulated in a preparation that included the plasma membrane. To implicate PKCα more directly in a model for RVD control in HeLa cells, we anticipated that PKCα should translocate to the plasma membrane to induce changes in GCl,swell activity. To test this model translocation of GFP-tagged wild-type PKCα and PKCζ were compared in transiently transfected HeLa cells. GFP-PKCα- or GFP-PKCζ-transfected cells maintained in either isotonic medium or after exposure to 30% hypotonicity for 4 min were examined by laser-scanning confocal microscopy (Fig. 6, A and B, respectively). In Fig. 6, A and B, a representative experiment is depicted showing cells for which dimensions in the x,y plane were conserved upon exposure to hypotonicity. Hence, swelling of these cells occurs along the z axis only. Cells in which dimensions in the x,y plane were not conserved upon swelling are also shown (Fig. 6A, inset). Only cells in which swelling occurred along the z axis were chosen for statistical analysis. This analysis was performed by taking a section across the cell that"

To begin to elucidate the mechanism of catalysis by this enzyme, choline kinase A-2 from Caenorhabditis elegans was analyzed by systematic mutagenesis of highly conserved residues followed by analysis of kinetic and structural parameters. Specifically, mutants were analyzed with respect to Km and kcat values for each substrate and Mg2+, inhibitory constants for Mg2+ and Ca2+, secondary structure as monitored by circular dichroism, and sensitivity to unfolding in guanidinium hydrochloride. The most severe impairment of catalysis occurred with the modification of Asp-255 and Asn-260, which are located in the conserved Brenner's phosphotransferase motif, and Asp-301 and Glu-303, in the signature choline kinase motif. For example, mutation of Asp-255 or Asp-301 to Ala eliminated detectable catalytic activity, and mutation of Asn-260 and Glu-303 to Ala decreased kcat by 300- and 10-fold, respectively. Additionally, the Km for Mg2+ for mutants N260A and E303A was approximately 30-fold higher than that of wild type. Several other residues (Ser-86, Arg-111, Glu-125, and Trp-387) were identified as being important: Catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) for the enzymes in which these residues were mutated to Ala were reduced to 2-25% of wild type. The high degree of structural similarity among choline kinase A-2, aminoglycoside phosphotransferases, and protein kinases, together with the results from this mutational analysis, indicates it is likely that these conserved residues are located at the catalytic core of choline kinase.

Phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant phospholipid in eukaryotic cells. It serves not only as a structural foundation for membrane bilayers, but also as a precursor for several lipid messengers (1Kent C. Carman G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 146-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 2Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, there are two major routes for biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine: the CDP-choline, or Kennedy, pathway and the pathway for the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine. In the CDP-choline pathway, choline is phosphorylated by choline kinase, then the phosphocholine reacts with CTP to make CDP-choline, and finally the CDP-choline is transferred to sn-1,2-diacylglycerol to form phosphatidylcholine (3Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The methylation pathway uses three molecules of S-adenosylmethionine in succession to convert phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine. In yeast the relative contribution of the two pathways to production of phosphatidylcholine depends on the supply of exogenous choline (4Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In mammals, the CDP-choline pathway is responsible for phosphatidylcholine production in all cells and tissues, although the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine also has a major role in liver (5DeLong C.J. Shen Y.J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Choline kinase (ATP:choline phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.32) catalyzes the initial step in the CDP-choline pathway. Since the discovery of choline kinase in 1953 (6Wittenberg J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 431-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), various forms of choline kinase from eukaryotes have been purified and characterized (7Porter T.J. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 414-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Aoyama C. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Ishidate K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 452-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kim K.H. Voelker D.R. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

Acta. 1998; 1390: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These enzymes are specific for ATP as the phosphate donor, but often can use both choline and ethanolamine as substrates. Enzymes that are specific for phosphorylation of ethanolamine are also known (11Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Choline kinase can be regulatory for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis under certain conditions (12Kent C. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Increased choline kinase activity is seen during early stages of mitogenic stimulation (13Cuadrado A. Carnero A. Dolfi F. Jimenez B. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2959-2968PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, elevated levels of choline kinase and its product, phosphocholine, have been found in human cancers, and the stimulation of choline kinase activity and/or expression by a ras oncogene has been proposed to be one of the mechanisms of this phenomenon (14Ramirez de Molina A. Penalva V. Lucas L. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Ratnam S. Kent C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Teegarden D. Taparowsky E.J. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6042-6047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of choline kinase has been targeted as a potential antitumor strategy (17Ramirez de Molina A. Rodriguez-Gonzalez A. Penalva V. Lucas L. Lacal J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent evidence shows that choline kinase can be regulated at the level of protein itself, as the yeast choline kinase is activated by phosphorylation in vitro or in vivo (18Kim K.H. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9531-9538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Yu Y. Sreenivas A. Ostrander D.B. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34978-34986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence for multiple isoforms of choline kinase in mammals was verified by the identification of two mammalian genes for choline kinase, α and β, and splice variants thereof (8Aoyama C. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Ishidate K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 452-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soybean also contains at least two genes encoding choline kinase (20Monks D.E. Goode J.H. Dewey R.E. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have recently identified seven choline kinase-like genes in Caenorhabditis elegans, and have verified that at least four of these genes encode active choline kinases (21Gee P. Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1648: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The seven genes were divided into three families, A-C, with the A family being the most similar to mammalian choline kinases. We have purified and characterized two of the C. elegans isoforms, choline kinase A-2 (CKA-2) 1The abbreviations used are: CKA-2, choline kinase A-2; APH(3′)IIIa, aminoglycoside-3′-phosphotransferase type IIIa; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; GdmCl, guanidinium hydrochloride; NPL, nucleotide positioning loop; ePK, eukaryotic protein kinase. and choline kinase B-2 (21Gee P. Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1648: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Despite the significance of this enzyme in lipid metabolism and diverse cellular processes, the enzyme has received relatively little attention in the literature, especially with respect to enzymology. For example, there are no studies on the catalytic mechanism of choline/ethanolamine kinases. We have chosen to pursue the characterization of CKA-2 from C. elegans as a model choline kinase. This enzyme is as catalytically active as choline kinase from mammals and yeast and is quite similar to them in primary structure. Moreover, CKA-2 has been amenable to crystallization, and the crystal structure of CKA-2 has been determined recently (22Peisach D. Gee P. Kent C. Xu Z. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the three-dimensional structure of CKA-2 is quite similar to those of protein kinases and aminoglycoside phosphotransferases, despite very low similarity in amino acid sequences among these enzymes. In this report, we have employed CKA-2 to probe the importance of key, conserved residues in catalysis by choline kinase. Additionally, guided by a comparison of the structures of CKA-2 and the well understood aminoglycoside phosphotransferase APH(3′)-IIIa (23Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M. Yang D.S. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), we discuss the contributions of these specific residues to the catalysis of CKA-2 at the molecular level. Materials—All oligonucleotide primers for mutagenesis were from Invitrogen. Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs. Protease inhibitor (Complete Mini EDTA-Free) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Guanidinium chloride, ATP, imidazole, and choline were from Sigma. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen. [methyl-14C]Choline was from Amersham Biosciences. Invitrogen was the source of the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system, Sf-9 cells adapted for serum-free growth, and Sf-900 II serum-free medium. Generation of Recombinant Baculovirus of CKA-2 and Its Variants—A 1.2-kb DNA fragment encoding C. elegans CKA-2 (21Gee P. Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1648: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was cloned into the modified baculovirus donor plasmid pFastBacHT (pFBHT) using NdeI and XhoI sites, generating the sequence MSYYH6DYDIPTTENLYFQGAMDPEFKGLLRH-CKA2, which contained 6 His residues and an rTEV protease cleavage site (underlined) at the amino terminus. This plasmid was then used as the template for all site-directed mutagenesis. The point mutations were introduced by overlap extension PCR (24Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). The codon GCN was used for conversion to Ala, GAA(G) for conversions to Glu, CAA(G) for conversions to Gln, GAC(T) for conversions to Asp, AAC(T) for conversions to Asn, and ACC for conversion to Thr. The resulting mutant fragments were placed into pFBHT using NdeI and XhoI. The sequences of all constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing in the DNA sequencing core at the University of Michigan. The preparation of virus encoding CKA-2 and its variants followed the instruction manual for the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system, except that two rounds of virus amplification and 6 days for each round were carried out to reach the needed levels of protein expression. Protein Expression and Purification—Sf-9 cells at the initial density of 1.0 × 106 cells/ml were infected with recombinant virus and harvested at 72 h after infection by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were frozen at -80 °C and thawed to facilitate lysis. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cell pellets from 500-ml cultures were resuspended in 8 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing protease inhibitors (21Gee P. Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1648: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and then lysed by homogenization. Following centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, clear supernatants were collected and adjusted to 300 mm KCl, 1 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol. The resultant supernatants were loaded onto the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column pre-equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol) containing 300 mm KCl and1 mm imidazole. The column was washed sequentially with buffer B (buffer A containing 1 m KCl, 20 mm galactose, and 20 mm imidazole) to remove the majority of contaminants, then buffer C (buffer A containing 300 mm KCl and 40 mm imidazole). The desired enzymes were eluted with buffer D (buffer A containing 300 mm KCl and 100 mm imidazole). The purified enzymes were dialyzed against buffer E (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) to remove the imidazole and then stored at 4 °C. The purity of enzymes was identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The concentration of enzyme protein was determined by the Bradford method (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Kinetic Analysis—Steady-state kinetic analysis was performed as described previously (21Gee P. Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1648: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 20-μl reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-glycine, pH 10, 11 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and enzyme with varying concentrations of ATP and [14C]choline. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 10 min, except as noted in Tables I, II, III, and stopped by adding 2 μl of acetic acid. Radiolabeled phosphocholine was separated from radiolabeled choline by paper chromatography in ethanol/ammonium hydroxide/isopropanol (6.5/3.5/2). The amount of labeled product was determined by scintillation counting. Enzyme assays for wild type and all mutants were linear with time and protein concentration. The kinetic parameters kcat and Km with respect to ATP and choline were determined from secondary plots by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (24Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N.

Plots of the initial rates versus free Mg2+ concentration were fit to either Equation 1 or 2, depending on whether or not inhibition by Mg2+ was observed. The concentration of free Mg2+ ion was calculated using the program CABUFFER provided by Dr. Gerard D. Wright (27Boehr D.D. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. J. Biol.

In Ca2+ inhibition experiments, the concentrations of ATP (10 mm), choline (10 mm), and Mg2+ (11 mm) were fixed, and the concentration of Ca2+ was varied from 1 to 20 mm. The IC50 for Ca2+ was calculated by fitting to Equation 3. v0-v=v0[I]/(IC50+[I])(Eq. 3) In Equation 3, v0 is the initial velocity in the absence of Ca2+, and [I] is the concentration of Ca2+. All data fitting was performed with Kaleidagraph software (Synergy). Circular Dichroism (CD)—CD studies were carried out on an Aviv CD-spectropolarimeter at 25 °C using a cuvette with a 1-mm path length. Proteins (150 μg/ml) were in buffer F (10 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0). All the solutions were filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane prior to use. Spectra were recorded over 200-250 nm in 1-nm increments (1 s averaging time). All data were the averages of three blank-corrected spectra. Unfolding Analysis—Protein (60 μg/ml) was incubated overnight at 4 °C in buffer F containing guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) at pH 8.0 at various concentrations. Circular dichroism was used to monitor the changes induced by GdmCl. Spectra over 215-230 nm were recorded with the same scanning parameters as indicated above. The ellipticity at 222 nm under different concentration of GdmCl was recorded for the unfolding transition profiles. Subsequently, all the data were normalized to relative fractions for the purpose of comparison. Normalized(%)=(θ-θD)/(θN-θD)(Eq. 4) θN is the ellipticity of the protein in the native conformation (in the absence of GdmCl), θD is the ellipticity of the protein in the unfolded state (at 4 m GdmCl in our case), and θ is the ellipticity at a given concentration of GdmCl. Gel Filtration—Analysis of protein size by gel filtration was performed by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superpose-12 HR (Amersham Biosciences) column at 4 °C. Samples of 200 μl (100 μg/ml) were loaded onto the column pre-equilibrated with buffer G (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min and monitored at 280 nm. The standard markers for molecular weight calibration were bovine thyroglobulin (670,000), gamma globin (158,000), bovine serum albumin (67,000), chicken ovalbumin (44,000), horse myoglobin (17,000), and vitamin B-12 (1350). Similarity among Choline/Ethanolamine Kinases—To search for critical residues in CKA-2, we compared the primary structure of CKA-2 with that of other choline or ethanolamine kinases from various sources. The alignment in Fig. 1 revealed a large number of highly conserved residues, with two noticeable clusters. The first cluster, (C/S)HXDhX3N (where h is a large hydrophobic residue) is similar to Brenner's phosphotransferase motif, hXHXDhX3N, which is shared by many protein kinases and aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (28Brenner S. Nature. 1987; 329: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29Bairoch A. Claverie J.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). The other cluster, which could be considered a signature motif for the choline/ethanolamine kinase family (8Aoyama C. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Ishidate K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 452-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is (LIV)X2ID(FWY)E(YF)X3NX3(FWY)DX6E. The conserved hydrophilic and aromatic residues were chosen for mutagenesis because the side chains of these residues are likely to be involved in catalysis and/or to make major contributions to the binding of substrates. A baculovirus expression system in which a His6 tag was incorporated at the amino terminus was employed to produce wild type and mutant CKA-2. Each purified enzyme exhibited a single band on SDS-PAGE, each protein migrating with a molecular mass of ∼51 kDa, which is consistent with the sum of size of native CKA-2 plus 36 extra residues including the His tag at the NH2 terminus. Two mutants, H181A and D313A, were not purified because of their low expression levels. The other mutants were analyzed as discussed below. Kinetic Analysis of Wild Type and Mutant CKA-2—Steady-state kinetic measurements were performed to compare the catalytic properties of various mutants with those of the wild type enzyme. First, the properties of the His-tagged wild type enzyme were compared with those of native CKA-2. The kinetic parameters (Table I), pH optimum (pH 10), and dimeric structure as determined by gel filtration were nearly identical, indicating that the overall structure of CKA-2 was not altered appreciably by the His tag. All subsequent studies were performed on His-tagged mutant and wild type forms. For presentation of the results, mutants generated in this study were sorted into three groups based on their positions in the primary structure. The groups were the NH2-terminal region, the phosphotransferase motif, and the COOH-terminal region which includes the choline kinase motif. NH2-terminal Region (Table I)—A Ser or Thr side chain at residue 86 is conserved among choline/ethanolamine kinases. Elimination of this hydroxyl by mutation to Ala had an effect on kcat (7-fold reduction) and Km for choline (5-fold increase), which led to a pronounced decrease in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for both ATP (9.0% of wild type) and choline (2.7% of wild type). Catalytic efficiencies were more similar to wild type when Ser-86 was replaced by Thr, suggesting that a hydroxyl at position 86 is essential for full activity. A conserved Asn residue neighbors the conserved Ser/Thr; however, modification of Asn-87 to Ala was much less detrimental than mutation of Ser-86 to Ala. The substitution of Arg-111 with Ala caused a modest reduction in kcat and a 4-fold increase in Km for ATP, resulting in a 10-fold reduction in kcat/Km for ATP. The replacement of Glu-125 with Ala or Gln resulted in modest effects on both kcat and Km for ATP. However, substitution of Glu-125 with Asp was not deleterious to activity. A positive charge at position 149 is conserved only in the choline/ethanolamine kinases; mutation of Arg-149 to Ala did not markedly affect the kinetic parameters of the enzyme. Phosphotransferase Motif (Table II)—This motif is conserved in many kinases, including the eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily (30Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar), in which the equivalent of Asp-255 and Asn-260 are absolutely conserved. Mutation of these two residues in CKA-2 had very dramatic effects. Enzymatic activity was not detectable in either D255A or D255N. Conserving the negative charge by mutation of Asp-255 to Glu resulted in low but detectable activity, with a reduction in kcat of approximately 300-fold and an increase in Km for choline by 5-fold. Mutation of Asn-260 to Ala resulted in a sharp drop in activity, with a 300-fold and reduction in kcat consistent with the highly conserved nature of this residue. His-253 is conserved in choline/ethanolamine kinases but not necessarily in kinases of this superfamily. Mutation of His-253 to Ala did not result in appreciable loss in initial activity, but the activity was linear with time only for a little over 30 s, whereas the wild type activity is linear for over 30 min. This instability with respect to activity suggested that His-253 has a structural role in the active site. N254A shows a similar instability, with activity linear only for 5 min. In addition, the kcat for N254A was reduced by approximately 30-fold. COOH-terminal Region (Table III)—Although the choline kinase motif is not shared among protein kinases and aminoglycoside phosphotransferases, residue Asp-301 of this motif does appear to be conserved among these other kinases structurally (see “Discussion”). Indeed, mutation of Asp-301 to Ala, Asn, and Glu resulted in a lack of any detectable enzymatic activity, even with 500 times more mutant protein in the assay mixture. This suggests that both the negative charge of Asp-301 and its precise position are critical for the activity of CKA-2. Glu-303 is conserved throughout the choline/ethanolamine kinases but not the other kinases. The Ala substitution for Glu-303 had a marked effect on both kcat (over 10-fold reduction) and Km values for both ATP and choline (3- and 10-fold increase, respectively), resulting in a sharp decrease in the catalytic efficiency. The kcat value was restored to nearly normal by mutation of Glu-303 to either Asp or Gln, although Km values were still abnormally high. Thus, the carbonyl function of this side chain appears to be necessary for optimal catalysis, whereas the precise position and negative charge affect the Km. Mutation of Asn-308 to Ala resulted in a modest decrease in kcat, but mutation to Asp and Gln resulted in catalytic efficiencies very similar to wild type. Substitution of Glu-320 with Ala resulted in an increased Km for ATP. The E320A mutant was also somewhat unstable in that its activity was linear for only approximately 5 min. This residue may have both catalytic and structural roles. Trp-387 is an absolutely conserved aromatic residue among choline/ethanolamine kinases. The kcat value for the W387A mutant was decreased 30-fold, with no change in Km values, consistent with an important role for this residue in catalysis. Structural Analysis of Wild Type and Mutant CKA-2—Mutants with pronounced catalytic defects (S86A, R111A, D255A(E), N260A, D301A, E303A, and W387A) were chosen for structural analysis to determine whether the catalytic defects were caused by extensive structural defects. The far-UV circular dichroic spectra of all these mutants were similar to that of the wild type protein (data not shown), indicating the mutations did not cause profound changes in the secondary structure under native conditions. Analysis of the mutant proteins by gel filtration was used to compare their quaternary structures. All mutated proteins had the same retention volume as the wild type enzyme, corresponding to a molecular weight of 102,000 under native conditions (data not shown). Additionally, with the exception of D255A and D301A, the enzymatic activity of the mutants under assay conditions was linear at 37 °C for at least 30 min, indicating that the thermal stability of these mutants under assay conditions is similar to that of the wild type. To further assess the conformational stability of each mutant, the sensitivity of the wild type and mutants to guanidinium-induced unfolding was determined by circular dichroism (Fig. 2). The wild type enzyme displayed a biphasic denaturation curve, with some unfolding occurring between 0.2 and 1 m, then further unfolding between 2 and 4 m. Most of the mutants exhibited similar biphasic unfolding curves, suggesting that these mutants are as stable, under these conditions, as the wild type. The first unfolding phase for W387A and D255E occurred at much lower guanidinium concentrations than for the other proteins, suggesting a lower degree"

The rate of release is concentration and affinity dependent. The optimal relationship between these two in prolonging the half-life of a pro-drug is the focus of this work. Interferon (IFN) β is one of the most widely used protein drugs in the clinic. Here, we show that the circulatory half-life of IFNβ can be significantly extended by co-administration with the extracellular domain of the IFN receptor ifnar2 (ifnar2-EC). To investigate the concentration/affinity relation, a range of tighter binding ifnar2-EC mutants was designed that bind IFNβ, but not IFNα2, up to 50-fold tighter compared with the wild-type ifnar2-EC. This increased affinity is related to a slower dissociation rate, whereas the association of IFNβ with ifnar2-EC is already near optimum. Using the wild-type and mutant receptors, we investigated their potential in occluding IFNβ from circulation in a tissue culture assay, as well as in rats. To determine the potential of ifnar2-EC as a carrier protein, we co-administered a mixture of IFNβ and ifnar2-EC to rats both intravenously and subcutaneously, and followed the blood plasma concentrations of IFNβ over time. The tighter binding ifnar2-EC mutant had a clear advantage in prolonging the half-life of IFNβ in circulation, even when lower protein concentrations were administered. A numerical simulation of the in vivo data demonstrates that the optimal binding affinity of a carrier protein is around the concentration needed to obtain optimal activity of the ligand.

A numerical simulation of the in vivo data demonstrates that the optimal binding affinity of a carrier protein is around the concentration needed to obtain optimal activity of the ligand. The occurrence of soluble proteins corresponding to the extracellular domains of transmembrane receptors and adhesion molecules in biological fluids are widely spread. These proteins retain their binding characteristics and typically function as natural antagonists, carrier molecules, or chaperones, protecting their ligands from proteolytic degradation; in some cases, they are biological agonists (1Sporri B. Bickel M. Dobbelaere D. Machado Jr., J. Lottaz D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 2Jones S.A. Horiuchi S. Topley N. Yamamoto N. Fuller G.M.

Martin M.U. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The cellular release of these soluble receptors is tightly regulated. It is typically controlled by one of two mechanisms. First, differential mRNA splicing that leads to the production and secretion of only the extracellular domain (i.e. interleukin 4, epidermal growth factor, and ifnar2 (6Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 7Jones S.A. Rose-John S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 8Cohen B. Novick D. Barak S. Rubinstein M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4208-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)). Second, specific proteolysis of the receptor from the cell surface (i.e. interleukin 1, interleukin 2, and tumor necrosis factor-α) (7Jones S.A. Rose-John S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). If binding is tight and discharge is slow, binding proteins maintain the cytokines in circulation, but inactive, resulting in an antagonistic behavior. However, the line between antagonist and agonist is blurred, and the same soluble receptor can act as both, depending on the circumstances (7Jones S.A. Rose-John S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The factors that most influence the role of soluble receptors as agonists or antagonists are the concentrations of the ligands, binding proteins, and unbound cytokines required for activity. The exact definition of quantities is complicated by the fact that cytokines may assume multiple roles with different partners, and in different cell lines. Thus, a binding protein may inhibit one activity, but promote a second. Type I interferons (IFNs) 1The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; ifnar2-EC, extracellular part of the interferon receptor ifnar2; wt, wild-type; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 1The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; ifnar2-EC, extracellular part of the interferon receptor ifnar2; wt, wild-type; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. are proteins initiating an antiviral and an antiproliferative response. The human type I interferons act through a common cell-surface receptor complex comprised of two subunits, ifnar1 and Ifnar2. Human Ifnar2 binds all type I IFNs at nanomolar affinities, whereas Ifnar1 binding is weak and hardly detectable on its own (9Cutrone E.C. Langer J.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Ifnar2 is produced in three forms: long, short, and as the extracellular soluble protein only. The three forms are the result of alternative processing of the human ifnar2 gene product (8Cohen B. Novick D. Barak S. Rubinstein M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4208-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 10Novick D. Cohen B. Rubinstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The long form was recognized as the functional subunit, and its expression in an ifnar2 mutant strain is sufficient to reconstitute a fully functional receptor (11Domanski P. Witte M. Kellum M. Rubinstein M. Hackett R. Pitha P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21606-21611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Expression of the short form generates a low-affinity binding site but no functional receptor. The biological role of the short and the extracellular forms of ifnar2 (ifnar2-EC) remain unclear. It was lately reported that ifnar2-EC possesses some antiviral activity on its own after prolonged incubation times (12Han C.S. Chen Y. Ezashi T. Roberts R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All forms of ifnar2 bind α and β interferons at approximately nanomolar affinity (9Cutrone E.C. Langer J.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Piehler J. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The structure of ifnar2-EC and of interferon was determined independently, and their complex was modeled (14Chill J.H. Quadt S.R. Levy R. Schreiber G. Anglister J. Structure. 2003; 11: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Roisman L.C. Piehler J. Trosset J.Y. Scheraga H.A. Schreiber G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The binding site of the two proteins was mapped using site-directed mutagenesis, double-mutant cycles, and distance-constrained docking (14Chill J.H. Quadt S.R. Levy R. Schreiber G. Anglister J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40425-40433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A comparison of the ifnar2 binding epitope with IFNα2 versus IFNβ revealed that both proteins competitively bind the same functional epitope on ifnar2, but with distinct binding centers. Residues on ifnar2 that cause the largest decrease in IFNα2 binding include Met-48, Glu-79, and Val-82; mutating these residues had only a moderate effect on IFNβ binding. However, mutating Trp-102 proved to be most destructive for IFNβ binding (18Lewerenz M. Mogensen K.E. Uzé G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Piehler J. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also found 2 residues on ifnar2-EC that specifically increase binding toward IFNβ but not IFNα2 (His-78 and Asn-100) (19Piehler J. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Whereas the differences in the mapped binding epitopes of IFNα2 and IFNβ may be because of differences in the angular orientation of the two proteins in the complex (with ifnar2-EC), they may also be because of differences in the composition of the binding sites of the interferons. IFNβ is approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis (21Noseworthy J.H. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2003; 16: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Jacobs L.D. Cookjair D.L. Rudick R.A.

Buraglio M. Eur. J. Neurol. 1998; 5: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is administered either subcutaneously or intramuscularly, and is rapidly cleared. In this paper, we examine the possibility of using the soluble part of the ifnar2 receptor as a carrier protein to prolong the circulatory half-life of IFNβ. We investigated the relationship between binding affinities, protein concentrations, and the potential of ifnar2-EC to serve as an agonist or antagonist of interferon in vivo. These questions were analyzed using theoretical simulations and experimental data. A range of ifnar2-EC mutants that bind IFNβ, but not IFNα2, at affinities up to 50-fold tighter compared with the wild-type, were prepared and tested in an attempt to probe the optimal binding affinity of a carrier protein. Protein Expression and Mutagenesis—Ifnar2-EC and IFNα2 were expressed and purified as previously described (13Piehler J. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). IFNβ was a generous gift from Prof. Menachem Rubinstein (Weizmann Institute of Science). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR amplification of the complete plasmids for expression (pT72Cα2) with 18-21 nucleotide primers containing the mutated codon using high fidelity polymerases pwo (Roche Applied Sciences) and pfu (Stratagene) as previously described (24Albeck S. Schreiber G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Receptor Binding Affinities—Binding affinities were evaluated using RifS or BIAcore measurements (25Schmitt H.M. Brecht A. Piehler J. Gauglitz G. Biosens. Bioelectronics. 1997; 12: 809-816Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Chip immobilization by ifnar2-EC and the preparation of the surface of RifS were carried out according to Piehler et al. (26Piehler J. Schreiber G. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ifnar2-EC was immobilized to the surface using the non-neutralizing anti-ifnar2-EC mAb 46.10 followed by cross-linking with a second mAb (117.7) (gift from Daniela Novick, Weizmann Institute of Science). The binding curves were evaluated with the BIAevaluation software (Biacore AB, Sweden) using a simple one-to-one kinetic model. Stopped-flow—Experimental values of kon were measured using stopped-flow fluorescence in either second-order conditions with the concentrations of interferon and ifnar2-EC being equal, or using pseudo-first order conditions with IFN being in at least a 5-fold excess over ifnar2-EC (13Piehler J. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Both conditions produced the same rate constants. Measurements were done in phosphate-buffered saline. In Vivo Experiments—These experiments were performed using male Wistar rats (150-170 g). Rats were injected either subcutaneously or intravenously (0.2 ml/rat). Antiviral Activity of IFNβ —Antiviral activity was determined by the capacity of the cytokine to protect human amnion WISH cells against vesicular stomatitis virus-induced cytopathic effects (27Rubinstein S. Familletti P.C. Pestka S. J. Virol. 1981; 37: 755-758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, native IFNα2 and IFNβ show 50% protection of vesicular stomatitis virus-induced WISH cells (ED50) at concentrations of 0.3 (1.7 × 108 units/mg) and 0.15 pm (3.4 × 108 units/mg), respectively. ELISA for Binding of IFNβ with ifnar2—5 μg/ml of wt or mutant ifnar2-EC (H78A, N100A, H78A/N100A) were immobilized on Exiqon™ protein immobilizer ELISA plates. IFNβ (initial concentration, 8 nm) was added to the plates, in 12 2-fold dilutions. To detect binding, the non-neutralizing anti-IFNβ Ab 117.1 was added (1:4000). Finally, an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Ab was added to finish the sandwich (1:5000). Color was developed using BM Blue soluble substrate (Roche Diagnostics, GmbH) (450 nm after quenching with HCl). The 50% saturation point was calculated using Equation 1, y=a+(b*KA/(c+KA))(Eq. 1) with KA being the 50% saturation point (which is related to the affinity), a = offset, b = amplitude, and c = concentration. Designing Tighter Binding ifnar2-IFNβ but Not ifnar2-IFNα2 Mutants—Two residues on ifnar2 were identified to specifically promote tighter binding toward IFNβ, but not toward IFNα2, His-78 and Asn-100 (19Piehler J. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Both residues are located on the edge (but on opposite sides) of the binding site of interferon on ifnar2 (Fig. 1) (15Roisman L.C. Piehler J. Trosset J.Y. Scheraga H.A. Schreiber G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13231-13236Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The two single mutants (H78A and N100A) were found to increase the binding affinity toward IFNβ by 3-5-fold each (Table I). To increase the affinity even further, three double mutant ifnar2-EC proteins were produced, and their binding toward IFNβ and IFNα2 was evaluated: H78A/N100A, H78A/N100D, and H78A/N100H.

Only koff values were determined from these data, since kon measurements for IFNβ binding ifnar2-EC are not reliable using this method (19Piehler J. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). IFNα2 binds all ifnar2-EC variants with comparable affinities, with a 3-fold difference between the weakest (H78A) and the tightest (H78A/N100D and H78A/N100H) ifnar2-EC mutants. The picture for IFNβ binding ifnar2-EC is fundamentally different. The dissociation rate constants measured between the ifnar2-EC mutants and IFNβ are significantly slower compared with the wild-type protein (Table I). The largest decrease in koff was measured for the three ifnar2-EC double mutants, which were 14-40-fold slower compared with the wild-type protein. The H78A/N100A double mutant seems to be the tightest binder. For this mutant, dissociation is so slow that it is difficult to determine its rate accurately (Fig. 2 and Table I). The Fast Rate of Association of IFNβ toward ifnar2-EC Is because of Long Range Electrostatic Steering—Binding affinities can be determined from kinetic data according to KD = koff/kon. To determine the kon values of IFNα2 or IFNβ binding ifnar2-EC reliably, we measured those reactions in solution under second-order conditions using a stopped-flow. At low ionic strength (I = 25 mm), IFNβ binds ifnar2-EC about 20-fold faster compared with IFNα2 (Table II). Even at physiological ionic strength (using phosphate-buffered saline), IFNβ binds ifnar2-EC 5-fold faster than IFNα2, with a rate constant of 5 × 107m-1 s-1. This very fast rate of association is the result of the strong electrostatic steering of IFNβ, but not of IFNα2, toward ifnar2-EC. IFNβ displays a strong positive electrostatic potential at its ifnar2 binding site, which is complementary to the negatively charged interferon-binding site on ifnar2 (Fig. 3). Much of the electrostatic attraction between IFNβ and ifnar2 stems from residues located close to the C terminus of IFNβ.Table IIKinetic data of association of interferons with ifnar2-ECIFNifnar2-ECNaClkonaValues of kon were measured using a stopped-flow under second-order conditions.

Open table in a new tab PARE (28Selzer T. Albeck S. Schreiber G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) is a computer program developed by us to calculate the rate of association of protein complexes using a known structure of the complex. Calculating the expected relative rate increase of IFNβ versus IFNα2 binding ifnar2 accurately simulated the observed rates (Table II). As the calculations are based on the atomic details of the complex (charge distribution and protein structure), the success of PARE in predicting the kon of IFNβ suggests that our structural model is accurate (29Selzer T. Schreiber G. Proteins. 2001; 45: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Moreover, the accurate simulation suggests that the difference in kon between IFNα2 and IFNβ in binding ifnar2-EC is because of electrostatic steering. The strong positive charge of the ifnar2 binding site on IFNβ may also explain the problems in measuring the association of IFNβ and ifnar2-EC (but not of IFNα2) using BIAcore or RIfS. This strong positive electrostatic potential may promote nonspecific interactions of IFNβ with the negatively charged carboxymethylated dextran layer on the surface of the sensor chips used in both BIAcore and RIfS. This would also explain our observation that binding of IFNβ, but not IFNα2, using RIfS has to be done in 500 mm salt, to reduce nonspecific binding to the surface. Combining the kinetic data of koff (obtained from RifS/BIAcore) and kon (from stopped-flow) enabled us to calculate the binding affinities. The binding data and affinities are summarized in Table I. The affinity of IFNβ toward wild-type ifnar2-EC is in the range of 0.1 nm, which is about 10-fold tighter than the affinity of ifnar2 toward IFNα2. This difference in affinity is mainly because of a significantly faster rate of association. The tightest binding ifnar2-EC mutant binds IFNβ extremely tightly with an affinity of ∼2 pm at physiological ionic strength, which is about 50-fold tighter than the wild-type protein. Direct Determination of Binding Affinities Using ELISA— Because it was difficult to precisely evaluate the koff of the very tight binding ifnar2-EC mutants, a second independent method was applied to measure binding, based on sandwich ELISA. Varying concentrations of IFNβ were added to Exiqon™ ELISA plates that were precoated with ifnar2-EC (wt and mutants). Binding of IFNβ to ifnar2-EC was evaluated using the non-neutralizing Ab 117.1 (gift of Daniela Novick). The IFNβ concentration yielding 50% saturation was determined using Equation 1 (“Experimental Procedures”) and summarized in Table I. Whereas the 50% saturation concentration determined from ELISA does not directly correspond to the binding affinity measured in real-time using RifS or BIAcore, the relative differences between the mutants were expected to be maintained. Indeed, a very good correlation between the differences in binding affinities of the mutant proteins measured using different methods was observed. The concentration of IFNβ yielding 50% saturation on an H78A/N100A ifnar2-EC-coated plate was 45-fold lower than that determined for the wt. The ELISA served as an independent confirmation of the data obtained from the kinetic experiments. Occlusion of Interferon by wt and Mutant ifnar2-EC—Soluble receptors have been shown to occlude free ligand from solution, when administered in large excess. Here, we measured the potential of ifnar2-EC to occlude IFNβ as reflected through the inhibition of the anti-viral activity of IFNβ in tissue culture. Briefly, WISH cells were incubated with a mixture of 5 pm IFNβ and increasing concentrations of ifnar2-EC (between 20 and 2500 pm) for 4 h prior to being challenged with the vesicular stomatitis virus. The concentration of free IFNβ was determined relative to a standard curve of the antiviral response of IFNβ (Fig. 4, inset). About 2 nm wt-ifnar2-EC were required to reduce the antiviral response of 5 pm IFNβ by half. This can be interpreted as being the 50% occlusion point (Fig. 4). When the H78A/N100A ifnar2-EC double mutant was added, only 0.05 nm ifnar2-EC were required: 40-fold less compared with the wt. The 50% occlusion concentrations of the other ifnar2-EC mutants were between these values, approximately according to their relative binding affinities. Whereas these concentrations cannot be taken as representing the IFNβ-ifnar2-EC binding affinity (biological activity is activated by the continuous presence of interferon for at least 4 h), the relative difference between the concentrations of the ifnar2-EC mutants measured to occlude 50% of the antiviral activity of IFNβ was in good agreement with the relative binding affinities of these mutants (Table I). Co-administration of Ifnar2-EC Prolongs Circulation of IFNβ in Rats—Small and medium sized proteins (up to ∼40 kDa) are rapidly removed from circulation by kidney filtration. Therefore, it is not surprising that the half-life of interferons in circulation is only ∼1 h (Fig. 5 and Ref. 30Pepinsky R.B. LePage D.J. Gill A. Chakraborty A. Vaidyanathan S. Green M. Baker D.P. Whalley E. Hochman P.S. Martin P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 1059-1066PubMed Google Scholar). We wished to determine whether the circulatory half-life of interferon could be prolonged by binding to ifnar2-EC, as an inactive pro-drug (the combined size of the complex is ∼45 kDa). As the molecular mass of ifnar2-EC produced heterologously in Escherichia coli is only 25 kDa and that of interferon is ∼20 kDa, we assumed that either unbound protein is rapidly removed from circulation, but not the complex. Therefore, IFNβ and ifnar2-EC were administered at equal concentrations, keeping most of the proteins in their bound form. To determine the residual concentration of IFNβ in circulation, the antiviral potency of rat serum was measured (relative to an IFNβ standard) at different time points following administration. Two methods of injection were used, subcutaneous and intravenous. Following subcutaneous administration of IFNβ alone, initial serum concentrations were about 5-fold lower compared with those determined after intravenous administration: when 3.5 μg/rat were injected, initial plasma levels of 0.5 and 2.5 nm were detected, respectively (extrapolated to time 0, Fig. 5, A and C). Assuming that the circulation volume of a rat weighing ∼180 g is ∼20 ml, the yield of active IFNβ in plasma is 5 and 25% (subcutaneous and intravenous, respectively), in line with values obtained previously. Native IFNβ (3.5 μg/rat) was removed from circulation within 10 h of injection. The short half-life of IFNβ (∼1 h) is independent on whether the protein was administered subcutaneously or intravenously (Fig. 5, A and C), suggesting a rapid transfer of IFNβ from the subcutaneous volume to the circulation. The measured plasma concentration of IFNβ scaled with the concentration injected. Subcutaneous administration of 20 μg/rat of IFNβ resulted in an initial plasma concentration of ∼3 nm (Fig. 5B): 6-fold higher compared with that measured for low concentrations injected. Next, we administered a 1:1 molar mixture of IFNβ and ifnar2-EC (wt or H78A/N100A) at two concentrations, 3.5 μg of IFNβ + 4 μg of ifnar2-EC, and 20 μg of IFNβ + 25 μg of ifnar2-EC. Monitoring the concentration of IFNβ in circulation displayed a rapid decline for the lower dosage, with a half-life of ∼1 h for IFNβ co-injected with wt ifnar2-EC. This suggests that at this concentration, wt ifnar2-EC had no effect on prolonging the half-life of IFNβ in circulation. However, co-injecting H78A/N100A ifnar2-EC with IFNβ showed a marked increase in the concentration of IFNβ in the serum; even at these low concentrations, IFNβ was still detected up to 24 h post-administration (Fig. 5C). When the same experiment was repeated intravenously, a marked increase in IFNβ concentrations was observed when the H78A/N100A ifnar2-EC double mutant served as the carrier protein (Fig. 5A). Administration of a higher concentration of proteins (20 μg of IFNβ + 25 μg ifnar2-EC) resulted in a marked increase in the half-life of IFNβ in circulation for either wt or H78A/N100A ifnar2-EC as the carrier protein. However, the measured concentration of IFNβ co-injected with H78A/N100A ifnar2-EC was about 10-fold higher compared with that found using wt ifnar2-EC. Moreover, IFNβ co-injected with the double mutant was detected in circulation up to 50 h post-administration, compared with 28 h for wt ifnar2-EC. Thus, administration of a mixture of IFNβ with H78A/N100A ifnar2-EC had three main effects: 1) the concentration of IFNβ in circulation was dramatically increased; 2) levels of IFNβ in the serum declined at a much slower rate; and 3) IFNβ remained in the plasma after extended time periods. The half-life of interferon in circulation is between 1 h in rats and 4 h in larger primates and humans (30Pepinsky R.B. LePage D.J. Gill A. Chakraborty A. Vaidyanathan S. Green M. Baker D.P.

The aggressive oncogenic potential of v-Rel has arisen from multiple mutations within the coding sequence of the avian cellular protein c-Rel. In this study, using quantitative biochemical experiments, we have tested the role of a limited set of alterations between v-Rel and c-Rel located within the Rel homology region (RHR) of the family that might confer functional differences. Our results show that only a set of six mutations within the RHR of v-Rel are responsible for its ability to bind to a broad spectrum of κB-DNA that are normally regulated by distinct NF-κB dimers. We also observe that both v-Rel homodimer and p50/v-Rel heterodimer bind IκBα weakly compared to other cellular Rel/NF-κB dimers with transcription activation potential. We suggest that the ability of v-Rel homodimer to deregulate subunit-specific gene expression and its ability to evade IκB inhibition are crucial to its strong oncogenic potential."

We have previously reported that CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) is required for the induction of acute phase protein (APP) genes in newborn mice in response to lipopolysaccharide. In this paper, we describe a mechanism by which C/EBPα knock-out mice are unable to induce APP gene expression in response to inflammatory stimuli. We demonstrate that the lack of acute phase response in C/EBPα knock-out mice is because of a hepatocyte autonomous defect. C/EBPα knock-out hepatocytes do not activate STAT3 in response to recombinant interleukin (IL)-6, indicating a defect in the IL-6 pathway. C/EBPα knock-out hepatocytes also do not show activation of other IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)-mediated Janus kinase substrates, gp130, SHP-2, and Tyk2. Further examination of the IL-6 pathway demonstrated that C/EBPα knock-out hepatocytes have decreased IL-6Rα protein levels caused, in part, by reduced protein stability. However, other components of the IL-6 pathway are intact, as demonstrated by rescue of STAT3 activation and APP gene induction with recombinant-soluble IL-6R linked to IL-6 cytokine (Hyper-IL-6) or with another gp130 signaling cytokine, Oncostatin M. In conclusion, C/EBPα is required for the proper regulation of IL-6Rα protein in hepatocytes resulting in a lack of acute phase protein gene induction in newborn C/EBPα null mice in response to lipopolysaccharide or cytokines.

At the site of damage, macrophages and other surrounding cells detect injury and respond by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α into the blood stream to elicit a systemic response. The liver is highly responsive to these cytokines because of the high density of cytokine receptors on hepatocytes. These cytokines evoke changes in expression of acute phase protein (APP) genes, such as positively regulated APP genes like serum amyloid A (SAA), γ-fibrinogen, and haptoglobin and negatively regulated APP genes like albumin and transferrin. These acute phase proteins are made by hepatocytes and then secreted into the blood-stream where they play a variety of roles in homeostasis, host defense, and minimizing tissue damage (see Refs. 1Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 2Moshage H. J. Pathol. 1997; 181: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α signal through known receptors to activate three major transcription factor families: NFκB, C/EBPs, and STATs. These factors regulate APP gene expression at the transcriptional level. IL-1 and TNF-α activate NFκB p50 and p65, which recognize the consensus sites in the promoters of many APP genes such the serum amyloid A gene family (3Li X.X. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15192-15201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of STAT3, which bind fibrinogen and α2-macroglobulin promoters among others (4Zhang Z. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24287-24291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Zhang X. Darnell Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33576-33581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). IL-1 and IL-6 induce C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ at both the transcriptional and protein activation levels, whereas C/EBPα is slightly down-regulated (6Ray B.K. Gao X. Ray A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 7Alam T. An M.R. Papaconstantinou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5021-5024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to the replacement of C/EBPα DNA binding at C/EBP sites in promoters of APP genes with C/EBPβ and δ. Previously, it was thought that C/EBPα played a passive role in the APR; however, our laboratory has shown that C/EBPα is required for the induction of many APP genes in mice (8Burgess-Beusse B.L. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7269-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Neonatal C/EBPα null mice do not elevate APP genes but do induce NFκB, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ DNA binding in response to LPS injection. In contrast, C/EBPα knock-out (KO) mice do not activate STAT3 DNA binding in response to LPS, indicating a defect in the IL-6-STAT3 signaling pathway (8Burgess-Beusse B.L. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7269-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). IL-6 is thought to be the main stimulator of the induction of APP genes during the hepatic acute phase response, whereas IL-1 and TNF-α influence the expression of subgroups of APP genes and induce IL-6 cytokine production (9Gauldie J. Richards C. Harnish D. Lansdorp P. Baumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7251-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). IL-6 knock-out mice induce APP genes in response to the systemic APR inducer bacterial LPS, whereas the response to a localized tissue damage by turpentine injection does not induce APP gene expression in these mice (10Fattori E. Cappelletti M. Costa P. Sellitto C. Cantoni L. Carelli M. Faggioni R. Fantuzzi G. Ghezzi P. Poli V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Additionally, IL-6 null mice respond to LPS by activation of STAT3; however, STAT3 is not activated in response to turpentine treatment (11Alonzi T. Fattori E. Cappelletti M. Ciliberto G. Poli V. Cytokine. 1998; 10: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The authors speculate that other STAT3 activating cytokines, such as leukemia inhibitory factor, IL-11, or Oncostatin M (OncM), may be induced in response to LPS but not to turpentine (10Fattori E. Cappelletti M. Costa P. Sellitto C. Cantoni L. Carelli M. Faggioni R. Fantuzzi G. Ghezzi P. Poli V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). STAT3 activation by an IL-6-like signaling pathway has recently been shown to be the most important regulator of APP gene expression in mice through tissue-specific inactivation of the STAT3 gene in the liver (12Alonzi T. Maritano D. Gorgoni B. Rizzuto G. Libert C. Poli V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In these tissue-specific STAT3 knock-out mice, most APP genes are not induced in response to LPS treatment. Interestingly, several genes found to be STAT3-responsive do not have STAT3 binding sites identified in their promoters. IL-6 cytokines signal by binding to an α-receptor subunit, IL-6Rα, which binds and signals through homodimerization of the common gp130 signaling molecule. The formation of these receptor complexes brings JAKs in close proximity to each other leading to cross-phosphorylation and activation of the JAKs, including Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2. The JAKs activate the Ras-MAPK pathway through phosphorylation of the phosphatase, SHP-2, leading to downstream activation of C/EBPβ. JAKs also activate STAT3 by tyrosine phosphorylation, permitting dimerization and entry into the nucleus where STAT3 dimers bind to STAT sites in the promoters of many APP genes (13Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has intensively investigated the roles of C/EBPα in mice. C/EBPα is a transcription factor highly expressed in liver and adipose tissue (14Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). C/EBPα null mice die shortly after birth because of hypoglycemia because C/EBPα is involved in regulating the expression of many glucose metabolism genes (15Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). We previously reported that neonatal C/EBPα null mice do not respond to LPS treatment by elevating APP genes and do not activate STAT3 DNA binding (8Burgess-Beusse B.L. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7269-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, it was not known whether the lack of APR in C/EBPα null mice was the result of a defect in the hepatocytes or in the extra-hepatocellular signaling of the injury. In this paper, we report that C/EBPα null hepatocytes cultured in vitro are unable to respond to recombinant IL-6 to induce APP gene expression and STAT3 DNA binding. The IL-1 pathway is intact as the predominantly IL-1-responsive gene SAA3 (16Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) is induced upon IL-1 treatment of C/EBPα knock-out hepatocytes. Additionally, we show that STAT3 is not activated because of defects in the IL-6R signaling pathway. Specifically, IL-6Rα protein levels in C/EBPα null hepatocytes are decreased, which is attributed in part to decreased protein stability of the receptor. Finally, the addition of the IL-6-like cytokine Oncostatin M or the soluble IL-6Rα linked to IL-6, termed Hyper-IL-6 (17Rakemann T. Niehof M. Kubicka S. Fischer M. Manns M.P. Rose-John S. Trautwein C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1257-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), is capable of activating STAT3 DNA binding and synergistic induction of the acute phase protein gene, SAA1, in primary hepatocytes derived from C/EBPα null mice. We propose that the dramatically reduced expression of the IL-6 receptor is responsible for the failure of C/EBPα knock-out mice to respond to inflammatory stimuli. APR Induction in Mice—Newborn mice were injected with 5 mg/kg body weight of LPS (Sigma) intraperitoneally to induce a generalized inflammatory response, and livers were harvested at time points after LPS injection. All of the neonatal mice were periodically injected with 10% glucose subcutaneously to counteract the perinatal hypoglycemia seen in C/EBPα knock-out pups. Primary Hepatocyte Isolation and Cell Culture—Livers from newborn C/EBPα KO and WT mice were harvested and were mechanically dissociated by scalpel. Hepatocytes were further dissociated from the liver pieces by shaking at 37 °C in EDTA-Earl's balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) for 10 min followed by a brief wash with M/M medium (three-parts Eagle's minimal essential medium and one-part Waymouth MAB 83/7 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum). Hepatocytes were then incubated in M/M medium containing 0.4 mg/ml collagenase P (Roche Applied Science) and 0.6 units/ml Dispase (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 37 °C followed by trituration. Isolated hepatocytes were filtered through a 70-μm nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon) to remove cellular aggregates and tissue debris. Hepatocytes were plated in M/M medium and allowed to attach for 2 h, and then cells were washed in M/M medium to remove non-adherent hematopoietic cells. Hepatocytes were finally plated in M/M medium containing dexamethasone (10-6) (Sigma), epidermal growth factor (50 ng/ml) (Invitrogen), and insulin (5 μg/ml) (Sigma). Cells were fed every other day and split at 80–90% confluency. Experiments were performed on days 7–10 post-isolation of primary hepatocytes. Cytokine Treatment—Primary hepatocytes were treated with all of the cytokines used at a concentration of 50 ng/ml in fresh medium for the time indicated in the figures. IL-1 was obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Oncostatin M and IL-6 were obtained from Sigma. Hyper-IL-6 was a generous gift from Dr. Rose-John at Christian-Albrechts Universitat (Kiel, Germany). Northern Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed on liver RNA harvested 4 h after LPS injection and on primary hepatocyte RNA after 20 h of cytokine treatment. Total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT60 according to manufacturer's directions (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Northern blot was performed as described previously (8Burgess-Beusse B.L. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7269-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Protein Extraction—Preparation of nuclear extracts was performed as described previously (18Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E.

Liver tissue or primary hepatocytes were homogenized, and nuclei were pelleted. Nuclei were lysed in a high salt extraction buffer on ice for 20 min and centrifuged to remove debris. RIPA whole cell extracts were used for membrane-bound proteins. Liver tissue or hepatocytes were lysed in a modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3Vo4, 1 mm NaF, and 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) by Dounce homogenization on ice for 20 min. Lysate was centrifuged for 10 min to remove cellular debris. STAT3 EMSA—Binding reactions were carried out in binding buffer containing 10 nm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) with 15 μg of nuclear extracts and 1-μl antibodies. After preincubation on ice for 20 min, radiolabeled m67SIE oligonucleotide (5′-ATGCATTTCCCGTAAATCAT-3′) was added followed by a 20-min incubation at room temperature. Samples were run on a 5% acrylamide, 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA-non-denaturing gel at 4 °C. The following polyclonal antibodies were used: STAT1(M-22)X and STAT3(C-20)X from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Western Analysis—50 μg of nuclear extract or 100 μg of RIPA whole cell extract were electrophoresed on a 1% SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel, and Western immunoblotting was performed as described previously (18Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L. Finegold M.J. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7353-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospho-tyrosine 705 STAT3 antibodies (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) were used at a 1:1000 dilution. STAT3 (C-20, 1:1000 dilution), gp130 (M-20, 1:1000 dilution), SHP-2 (C-18, 1:1000 dilution), and IL-6Rα (M-20, 1:200 dilution) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). β-actin antibodies (Sigma) 1:10,000) were used to show loading control. Anti-rabbit HRP secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch (1:2500) (West Grove, PA). Anti-mouse HRP secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (1:2500). Immunoprecipitation of Tyrosine-phosphorylated Proteins—1 mg of RIPA liver extract was pre-cleared with 100 μl of BioMag protein A/G beads (Qiagen) rocking at 4 °C for 30 min. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated using a mixture of several antibodies: PY20 (3 μg, BD Biosciences); PY69 (3 μg, BD Biosciences); and rabbit immunoaffinity-purified IgG anti-phosphotyrosine (3 μg, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for 2 h of rocking at 4 °C. 100 μl of BioMag protein A/G beads were added to precipitate the protein-antibody complexes for 1 h. Immunocomplexes were isolated using magnetic separators (Qiagen), and the non-precipitated supernatant was saved for Western blot analysis. The immune complexes were washed six times with modified RIPA buffer and boiled in SDS loading buffer. Pre-cleared extracts, immunoprecipitated proteins, and the supernatant were electrophoresed on 1% SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels for Western blot analysis. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—Ribonuclease protection assay was performed using the RiboQuant Multi-Probe RNase protection assay system (BD Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions using 10 μg of RNA. mCR-4 multi-probe template set (BD Biosciences) was used to examine IL-6Rα, gp130, and GAPDH RNA levels in primary hepatocytes. Quantitation was performed by phosphorimaging. Statistical significance was determined by paired Student's t test. Pulse-Chase Stability Analysis—Pulse-labeling experiment was performed as below in pulse-chase experiments with the time points indicated for the pulse with a 1-h pretreatment of the cells with 200 μm chloroquine and 50 μm MG132. C/EBPα WT and KO hepatocytes were washed twice with methionine-cysteine-free minimum Eagle's medium and starved for 20 min in methionine-cysteine-free minimum Eagle's medium. The cells were then pulsed with 70 μCi/ml Easytag Express protein-labeling mixture of [35S]methionine and cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 45 min. Cells were then washed three times with chase medium (M/M, 10% fetal calf serum, 15 μg/ml cold methionine, 31.3 μg/ml cold cysteine) and then incubated in 3 ml of chase medium for the time points. RIPA cell lysates were made as described earlier. 400 μg of extract was pre-cleared with protein A-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h. IL-6Rα was immunoprecipitated with 6 μg of polyclonal IL-6Rα (M-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. 75 μl of protein A-agarose was added for 2 h to precipitate the protein antibody complex. Immune complexes were washed 4× with modified RIPA buffer, boiled in SDS-loading buffer, and run on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Graph represents the averages of two individual experiments. Cycloheximide Protein Stability Analysis—C/EBPα WT and KO hepatocytes were treated with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide for 0–4 h. RIPA extracts were made at 0-, 0.5-, 1-, 2-, and 4-h time points. IL-6Rα protein levels were analyzed by Western blot analysis and densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer, and ImageQuant software was performed to quantitate protein levels normalized to β-actin loading. Graph represents the averages of three experiments. C/EBPα WT and KO hepatocytes were also pre-treated with 200 μm chloroquine or 50 μm MG132 for 2 h prior to cycloheximide treatment for 0 and 4 h. Real-time RT-PCR——Primary hepatocyte RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini-kit with the RNase-free DNase kit in accordance with manufacturer's protocols. 2 μg of total RNA was used for reverse transcription using oligo(dT) and Superscript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The RT reactions were diluted to 1 ng/μl by spectrophotometer 280/260 reading, and 3 μl was used for real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR Master mixture (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Primers used for SAA1 were: forward 5′-GGAGTCTGCCATGGAGGGTT-3′ and reverse 5′-CCCTTGGAAAGCCTCGTGA-3′. β-actin-loading control primers were: forward 5′-CTGCTCTGGCTCCTAGCACC-3′ and reverse 5′-CGCTCAGGAGGAGCAATGA-3′. Graphic calculations were performed using the comparative CT method with data scaled to the control samples of each genotype. Lack of IL-6-induced APP Gene Induction during the APR Is a Hepatocyte Autonomous Defect in C/EBPα Null Mice—Newborn C/EBPα null mice are unable to respond to the bacterial endotoxin LPS and do not induce APP genes, such as γ-fibrinogen and SAA1 (Fig. 1A). However, we have observed that IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 mRNA levels are induced in both C/EBPα KO and WT livers in response to LPS treatment (data not shown). Therefore, to determine whether the defect in APP gene induction was because of a systemic defect in the C/EBPα knock-out mice or a defect in the hepatocytes themselves, primary hepatocytes derived from newborn C/EBPα knock-out and wild type mice were cultured for 7–10 days and treated with recombinant cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 to simulate the acute phase response or directly with LPS. APP genes in WT primary hepatocytes were elevated in response to the recombinant cytokine mixture of IL-1 and IL-6 and LPS, whereas C/EBPα KO primary hepatocytes showed no increase in APP expression (Fig. 1, B and C). Basal levels of γ-fibrinogen are decreased in C/EBPα KO hepatocytes (Fig. 1B) but detectable in longer exposures (data not shown). WT primary hepatocytes showed increased expression (∼2-fold) of γ-fibrinogen over basal levels and a large induction of SAA1 from the undetectable basal expression, whereas C/EBPα KO hepatocytes do not induce these genes. However, the SAA3 gene, which is predominantly IL-1-responsive (16Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), is induced in both WT and KO hepatocytes when treated with recombinant IL-1 and IL-6 mixture (Fig. 1B) and with IL-1 alone (data not shown), indicating that the IL-1 pathway is intact in hepatocytes lacking C/EBPα. The fact that the C/EBPα KO hepatocytes do not respond to the addition of recombinant IL-6 to elevate most APP genes indicates that the hepatocytes lack some component of this pro-inflammatory signaling pathway. C/EBPα Null Primary Hepatocytes Are Unable to Activate STAT3 in Response to IL-6 Treatment—The IL-6 signaling pathway activates STAT3 DNA binding and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. We then asked whether STAT3, the main transcription factor activated by IL-6 and involved in the induction of APP genes, can be activated by LPS or the IL-1/IL-6 cytokine mixture in C/EBPα knock-out mice. STAT3 is activated in liver in response to 4 h of LPS treatment in WT mice (Fig. 2A) as demonstrated by neutralization of most of the binding with STAT3 antibodies (S3). However, STAT3 DNA binding is not induced in C/EBPα knock-out liver in response to LPS treatment (Fig. 2A). In WT primary hepatocytes, STAT3 DNA binding is induced at both 1 and 4 h after IL-1/IL-6 treatment, whereas C/EBPα null primary hepatocytes induce very little or no STAT3 DNA binding at any time point after IL-1/IL-6 treatment (Fig. 2B). The addition of STAT3 anti-serum to the binding reaction causes neutralization of STAT3 DNA binding. The specificity of STAT3 binding to a STAT3 consensus-binding oligomer (m67SIE) is shown by competition with cold m67SIE competimer (CC). Western blot analysis of liver nuclear extracts using phospho-tyrosine 705-specific STAT3 antibodies show induction of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in WT mice in response to LPS treatment, whereas C/EBPα KO mouse liver shows very little phosphorylated STAT3 induced by LPS (Fig. 2C). In addition, cultured WT hepatocytes induce STAT3 phosphorylation in response to the IL-1 and IL-6 mixture (Fig. 2D). However, C/EBPα KO primary hepatocytes showed no STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to the IL-1/IL-6 treatment (Fig. 2D). Because the IL-6-STAT3 pathway is the major inducer of the hepatic acute phase response, it is probable that the lack of APP gene induction in C/EBPα KO mice and hepatocytes is because of a defect in the IL-6-STAT3 signaling cascade. JAK-associated Tyrosine Phosphorylation Is Reduced in C/EBPα Knock-out Mice—Because JAKs are the family of kinases responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in the IL-6 signaling pathway (13Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar), we then asked whether JAK kinases were activated in response to LPS in C/EBPα KO mice. We analyzed the activation of JAK by examining the phosphorylation status of targets of JAK kinases, gp130 and SHP-2, and a member of the JAK family of kinases itself, Tyk2. Immunoprecipitation of proteins containing phosphorylated tyrosine residues and Western blot analysis of gp130, SHP-2, and Tyk2, downstream targets of IL-6 receptor signaling, demonstrated reduced phosphorylation of these proteins in C/EBPα KO liver compared with WT liver following LPS treatment (Fig. 3A). Equal levels of gp130 and SHP-2 in the WT and KO extracts are shown in Fig. 3B, whereas Tyk2 is not detectable at 0 h but induced in both WT and KO liver following LPS treatment. The lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of four substrates (STAT3, gp130, SHP-2, and Tyk2) of JAK kinases in C/EBPα KO liver indicates that the entire IL-6 pathway is not activated in response to recombinant IL-6 or LPS. C/EBPα KO Liver and Hepatocytes Have Decreased Levels of the IL-6Rα—Because C/EBPα KO hepatocytes do not respond to IL-6 by elevating APP gene expression, activating JAKs, or activating STAT3, expression levels of the IL-6 receptor signaling components were examined. Ribonuclease protection assay analysis of IL-6Rα and gp130 mRNA levels were performed on three independent sets of primary hepatocytes derived from C/EBPα KO and WT mouse livers. The graphs in Fig. 4, A and B, show the phosphorimage quantitation of the mRNA levels of IL-6Rα and gp130 as a ratio to a GAPDH-loading control. IL-6Rα mRNA levels are not statistically different (p = 0.40, 0.25, and 0.62, respectively, for 0, 1, and 4 h) between the genotypes in control or IL-1 and IL-6 cytokine-treated primary hepatocytes. C/EBP KO and WT hepatocytes also express gp130 mRNA levels (Fig. 4B) that are not statistically significant different (p = 0.78, 0.49, and 0.19, respectively, for 0, 1, and 4 h). The protein levels of IL-6Rα and gp130 were also analyzed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4C, the protein levels of IL-6Rα are greatly reduced in C/EBPα KO primary hepatocytes. Densitometric quantitation of the ratio of IL-6Rα to β-actin protein levels is shown below the panel. This quantitation shows IL-6Rα protein levels to be 4–5-fold lower in C/EBPα KO hepatocytes compared with WT hepatocytes, whereas gp130 protein levels are approximately equal between WT and KO primary hepatocytes with β-actin shown as a loading control. Additionally, we examined the protein levels of IL-6Rα in C/EBPα KO and WT mice in C/EBPα expressing tissues, liver, lung, and brown adipose tissue to determine whether C/EBPα regulates IL-6Rα in all of the C/EBPα-expressing tissues. The IL-6Rα protein levels are reduced in C/EBPα KO liver but are not different between other C/EBPα WT and KO tissues, lung and brown fat (Fig. 4D). This indicates that decreased IL-6Rα protein levels in C/EBPα KO liver is a hepatocyte-specific defect. The discrepancy between IL-6Rα mRNA and protein levels in C/EBPα KO and WT primary hepatocytes suggests that the protein is differentially regulated between the genotypes post-transcriptionally, possibly at the level of protein stability. Decreased Protein Stability of IL-6Rα in C/EBPα KO-derived Primary Hepatocytes—We asked whether the rate of translation of IL-6Rα was changed between C/EBPα KO and WT hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine in the presence of protease inhibitors, MG132 and chloroquine, over several time points. The rate of [35S] incorporation into IL-6Rα protein is not statistically different between C/EBPα WT and KO hepatocytes with p = 0.26 and p = 0.21 for the 30- and 60-min time points, respectively (Fig. 5A). We then asked whether decreased protein stability is responsible for the reduced protein levels in C/EBPα KO hepatocytes. To measure the half-life of IL-6Rα protein in primary hepatocytes, we performed a pulse-chase experiment. WT and C/EBPα KO hepatocytes were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 45 min and chased with excess unlabeled methionine and cysteine for the times indicated in Fig. 5, B and C. IL-6Rα was immunoprecipitated and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Pulse-chase analysis of IL-6Rα shows the half-life to be approximately two times longer in C/EBPα WT hepatocytes compared with KO hepatocytes. Confirming that C/EBPα WT hepatocytes have a longer IL-6Rα protein half-life, cycloheximide treatment of the hepatocytes was employed to block new protein synthesis. The rate of protein degradation of IL-6Rα was determined over a 4-h treatment period. Basal levels of IL-6"
