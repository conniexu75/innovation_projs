https://openalex.org/W2054447438,"Background Previous lipidomic analyses of the human meibum had largely focused on individuals from non-Asian populations, despite the higher prevalence of dysfunctional tear syndrome (DTS) observed across Asia. Information pertaining to the alterations in lipid profiles in relation to DTS onset and progression is also lacking and warrants comprehensive experimental analysis. Methodologies/Principal Findings We examined the meibum lipidome of 27 DTS patients and 10 control subjects for a total of 256 lipid species from 12 major lipid classes, including cholesteryl ester (CE), wax ester (WE), triacylglyceride (TAG), (O-acyl)-ω-hydroxy fatty acid (OAHFA), glycerophospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, PC; phosphatidylethanolamine, PE; phosphatidylinositol, PI; phosphatidylglycerol, PG) and sphingolipids (sphingomyelin, SM; ceramide, Cer; glucosylceramide, GluCer; dihexosylceramide, DihexCer). Neutral lipids were analysed using high-performance liquid-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of polar lipid species. DTS patients were classified into three severity groups (i.e. mild, moderate and severe) based on the ocular surface disease index (OSDI). A significantly lower level of TAG (p<0.05) was observed in patients under the moderate category compared to the mild category. Notably, a number of OAHFA species displayed consistently decreasing levels that correlate with increasing disease severity. An attempt was also made to investigate the changes in meibum lipid profiles of DTS patients compared to normal individuals classified based on OSDI score. Several unsaturated TAG and PC species were found at significantly higher levels (p<0.05) in patients than controls. Conclusion The current study presents, for the first time, a comprehensive lipidome of meibum from individuals of an Asian ethnicity, which can potentially offer new insights into the higher prevalence of DTS observed amongst Asian populations. This study also represents an attempt towards identification of lipid species in meibum which could serve as marker for DTS."

A matching revolution in our understanding of biological systems, however, will only be realized when similar advances are made in informatic analysis of the resulting ""big data."" Here, we compare the capabilities of three conventional and novel statistical approaches to summarize and decipher the tomato metabolome.Principal component analysis (PCA), batch learning self-organizing maps (BL-SOM) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were applied to a multivariate NMR dataset collected from developmentally staged tomato fruits belonging to several genotypes. While PCA and BL-SOM are appropriate and commonly used methods, WGCNA holds several advantages in the analysis of highly multivariate, complex data.PCA separated the two major genetic backgrounds (AC and NC), but provided little further information. Both BL-SOM and WGCNA clustered metabolites by expression, but WGCNA additionally defined ""modules"" of co-expressed metabolites explicitly and provided additional network statistics that described the systems properties of the tomato metabolic network. Our first application of WGCNA to tomato metabolomics data identified three major modules of metabolites that were associated with ripening-related traits and genetic background."
https://openalex.org/W2066022850,"Sepsis is controlled by endogenous glucocorticoids (GCs). Previous studies provided evidence that crosstalk of the monomeric GC receptor (GR) with proinflammatory transcription factors is the crucial mechanism underlying the suppressive GC effect. Here we demonstrate that mice with a dimerization-deficient GR (GRdim) are highly susceptible to sepsis in 2 different models, namely cecal ligation and puncture and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. TNF-α is normally regulated in these mice, but down-regulation of IL-6 and IL-1β is diminished. LPS-treated macrophages derived from GRdim mice are largely resistant to GC actions in vitro in terms of morphology, surface marker expression, and gene expression. Treatment with recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist improved survival of GRdim mice and mice lacking the GR in macrophages (GRLysMCre) mice. This suggests that regulation of IL-1β in macrophages by GCs is pivotal to control sepsis.—Kleiman, A., Hübner, S., Rodriguez Parkitna, J. M., Neumann, A., Hofer, S., Weigand, M. A., Bauer, M., Schmid, W., Schütz, G., Libert, C., Reichardt, H. M., Tuckermann, J. P.

https://openalex.org/W2016071629,"The success of any symbiosis under stress conditions is dependent upon the responses of both partners to that stress. The coral symbiosis is particularly susceptible to small increases of temperature above the long term summer maxima, which leads to the phenomenon known as coral bleaching, where the intracellular dinoflagellate symbionts are expelled. Here we for the first time used quantitative PCR to simultaneously examine the gene expression response of orthologs of the coral Acropora aspera and their dinoflagellate symbiont Symbiodinium. During an experimental bleaching event significant up-regulation of genes involved in stress response (HSP90 and HSP70) and carbon metabolism (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase) from the coral host were observed. In contrast in the symbiont, HSP90 expression decreased, while HSP70 levels were increased on only one day, and only the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase expression levels were found to increase. In addition the changes seen in expression patterns of the coral host were much larger, up to 10.5 fold, compared to the symbiont response, which in all cases was less than 2-fold. This targeted study of the expression of key metabolic and stress genes demonstrates that the response of the coral and their symbiont vary significantly, also a response in the host transcriptome was observed prior to what has previously been thought to be the temperatures at which thermal stress events occur."
https://openalex.org/W2021216897,"Background Previous work has suggested, but not demonstrated directly, a critical role for both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons of the pontine tegmentum in the regulation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine the in vivo roles of these fast-acting neurotransmitters in putative REM pontine circuits, we injected an adeno-associated viral vector expressing Cre recombinase (AAV-Cre) into mice harboring lox-P modified alleles of either the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) or vesicular GABA-glycine transporter (VGAT) genes. Our results show that glutamatergic neurons of the sublaterodorsal nucleus (SLD) and glycinergic/GABAergic interneurons of the spinal ventral horn contribute to REM atonia, whereas a separate population of glutamatergic neurons in the caudal laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (cLDT) and SLD are important for REM sleep generation. Our results further suggest that presynaptic GABA release in the cLDT-SLD, ventrolateral periaqueductal gray matter (vlPAG) and lateral pontine tegmentum (LPT) are not critically involved in REM sleep control. Conclusions/Significance These findings reveal the critical and divergent in vivo role of pontine glutamate and spinal cord GABA/glycine in the regulation of REM sleep and atonia and suggest a possible etiological basis for REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)."
https://openalex.org/W2110719496,"In Gram-positive bacteria, the transcriptional regulator CcpA is at the core of catabolite control mechanisms. In the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, links between CcpA and virulence have been established, but its role as a master regulator in different nutritional environments remains to be elucidated. Thus, we performed whole-transcriptome and metabolic analyses of S. pneumoniae D39 and its isogenic ccpA mutant during growth on glucose or galactose, rapidly and slowly metabolized carbohydrates presumably encountered by the bacterium in different host niches. CcpA affected the expression of up to 19% of the genome covering multiple cellular processes, including virulence, regulatory networks and central metabolism. Its prevalent function as a repressor was observed on glucose, but unexpectedly also on galactose. Carbohydrate-dependent CcpA regulation was also observed, as for the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway genes, which were activated by galactose and repressed by glucose. Metabolite analyses revealed that two pathways for galactose catabolism are functionally active, despite repression of the Leloir genes by CcpA. Surprisingly, galactose-induced mixed-acid fermentation apparently required CcpA, since genes involved in this type of metabolism were mostly under CcpA-repression. These findings indicate that the role of CcpA extends beyond transcriptional regulation, which seemingly is overlaid by other regulatory mechanisms. In agreement, CcpA influenced the level of many intracellular metabolites potentially involved in metabolic regulation. Our data strengthen the view that a true understanding of cell physiology demands thorough analyses at different cellular levels. Moreover, integration of transcriptional and metabolic data uncovered a link between CcpA and the association of surface molecules (e.g. capsule) to the cell wall. Hence, CcpA may play a key role in mediating the interaction of S. pneumoniae with its host. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that S. pneumoniae optimizes basic metabolic processes, likely enhancing in vivo fitness, in a CcpA-mediated manner."
https://openalex.org/W2013948181,"Background A new hypervirulent (hypermucoviscous) clinical variant of Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) has emerged over the last decade. Our goal is to identify new mechanisms, which increase the virulence hvKP compared to “classic” K. pneumoniae (cKP). Methodology/Principal Findings Various growth assays were performed in human ascites, human serum, and laboratory medium with the hvKP strain hvKP1 (wt), randomly chosen blood isolates of cKP strains (cKP1-4), and mutant constructs deficient in the secretion of selected compounds. An in vivo mouse model that mimics infection due to hvKP and a quantitative siderophore assay were also used. It was established that a molecule(s)/factor(s) was secreted by hvKP1 significantly enhanced its growth and/or survival in human ascites. This molecule(s)/factor(s) also increased the growth and/or survival of hvKP1 in serum ex vivo and in an in vivo mouse model that measures metastatic spread after subcutaneous challenge, thereby further establishing biologic significance. Although features such as a size of <3kD, heat stability, and growth characteristics in ascites suggested this molecule(s) was a quorum-sensing compound, data presented demonstrates that this molecule(s)/factor(s) is involved in iron uptake and is likely a siderophore(s) or another iron-acquisition molecule. Although it is known that iron acquisition is critical for virulence, a novel aspect of this observation is that hvKP1 produces quantitatively more siderophores that appear to be biologically more active (increased affinity for iron or more resistant to host factors) than those produced by cKP strains. Conclusions/Significance The data presented delineates a new mechanism by which hvKP increases its pathogenic potential compared to cKP strains. This paradigm may be broadly applicable to other extraintestinal gram-negative bacilli."
https://openalex.org/W2167969650,"The relationship between species and the functional diversity of assemblages is fundamental in ecology because it contains key information on functional redundancy, and functionally redundant ecosystems are thought to be more resilient, resistant and stable. However, this relationship is poorly understood and undocumented for species-rich coastal marine ecosystems. Here, we used underwater visual censuses to examine the patterns of functional redundancy for one of the most diverse vertebrate assemblages, the coral reef fishes of New Caledonia, South Pacific. First, we found that the relationship between functional and species diversity displayed a non-asymptotic power-shaped curve, implying that rare functions and species mainly occur in highly diverse assemblages. Second, we showed that the distribution of species amongst possible functions was significantly different from a random distribution up to a threshold of ∼90 species/transect. Redundancy patterns for each function further revealed that some functions displayed fast rates of increase in redundancy at low species diversity, whereas others were only becoming redundant past a certain threshold. This suggested non-random assembly rules and the existence of some primordial functions that would need to be fulfilled in priority so that coral reef fish assemblages can gain a basic ecological structure. Last, we found little effect of habitat on the shape of the functional-species diversity relationship and on the redundancy of functions, although habitat is known to largely determine assemblage characteristics such as species composition, biomass, and abundance. Our study shows that low functional redundancy is characteristic of this highly diverse fish assemblage, and, therefore, that even species-rich ecosystems such as coral reefs may be vulnerable to the removal of a few keystone species."
https://openalex.org/W2009789486,"Obesity is prevalent worldwide and is associated with insulin resistance. Advanced studies suggest that obesity-associated low-grade chronic inflammation contributes to the development of insulin resistance and other metabolic complications. Thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) is a multifunctional extracellular matrix protein that is up-regulated in inflamed adipose tissue. A recent study suggests a positive correlation of TSP1 with obesity, adipose inflammation, and insulin resistance. However, the direct effect of TSP1 on obesity and insulin resistance is not known. Therefore, we investigated the role of TSP1 in mediating obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance by using TSP1 knockout mice.Male TSP1-/- mice and wild type littermate controls were fed a low-fat (LF) or a high-fat (HF) diet for 16 weeks. Throughout the study, body weight and fat mass increased similarly between the TSP1-/- mice and WT mice under HF feeding conditions, suggesting that TSP1 deficiency does not affect the development of obesity. However, obese TSP1-/- mice had improved glucose tolerance and increased insulin sensitivity compared to the obese wild type mice. Macrophage accumulation and inflammatory cytokine expression in adipose tissue were reduced in obese TSP1-/- mice. Consistent with the local decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, systemic inflammation was also decreased in the obese TSP1-/- mice. Furthermore, in vitro data demonstrated that TSP1 deficient macrophages had decreased mobility and a reduced inflammatory phenotype.TSP1 deficiency did not affect the development of high-fat diet induced obesity. However, TSP1 deficiency reduced macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue and protected against obesity related inflammation and insulin resistance. Our data demonstrate that TSP1 may play an important role in regulating macrophage function and mediating obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. These data suggest that TSP1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target to improve the inflammatory and metabolic complications of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2089952276,"Plant roots are able to absorb sugars from the rhizosphere but also release sugars and other metabolites that are critical for growth and environmental signaling. Reabsorption of released sugar molecules could help reduce the loss of photosynthetically fixed carbon through the roots. Although biochemical analyses have revealed monosaccharide uptake mechanisms in roots, the transporters that are involved in this process have not yet been fully characterized. In the present study we demonstrate that Arabidopsis STP1 and STP13 play important roles in roots during the absorption of monosaccharides from the rhizosphere. Among 14 STP transporter genes, we found that STP1 had the highest transcript level and that STP1 was a major contributor for monosaccharide uptake under normal conditions. In contrast, STP13 was found to be induced by abiotic stress, with low expression under normal conditions. We analyzed the role of STP13 in roots under high salinity conditions where membranes of the epidermal cells were damaged, and we detected an increase in the amount of STP13-dependent glucose uptake. Furthermore, the amount of glucose efflux from stp13 mutants was higher than that from wild type plants under high salinity conditions. These results indicate that STP13 can reabsorb the monosaccharides that are released by damaged cells under high salinity conditions. Overall, our data indicate that sugar uptake capacity in Arabidopsis roots changes in response to environmental stresses and that this activity is dependent on the expression pattern of sugar transporters.

https://openalex.org/W2143067351,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important molecules involved in the activation of innate and subsequent development of adaptive immunity. TLRs are ligated by exogenous ligands from pathogens and by endogenous ligands released in inflammatory diseases. Activation of TLR leads to activation of NF-κB and release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α. TLRs play an important role in the pathogenesis of renal diseases. Increased expression of TLRs have been associated with ischemic kidney damage, acute kidney injury, end-stage renal failure, acute renal transplant rejection, and delayed allograft function. OPN301 is a mouse anti-human TLR2 antibody that cross-reacts with mouse TLR2. We show that inhibition of TLR2 promotes graft function in an isograft model of renal transplantation. Recipient mice were treated intravenously with OPN301 before reperfusion of the transplanted kidney that had been subjected to 30 min of cold ischemia. After 5 d, the residual native kidney was removed, and renal transplant function was assessed 24 h later by measurement of blood urea nitrogen. Renal function in both saline- and isotype-treated mice was similar, with significant improvement in OPN301-treated mice (isotypetreated vs. OPN301-treated: 33.9±3.2 vs. 19.8±1.9 μM; P<0.01). The histopathological appearance corresponded with renal functional results. In OPN301-treated recipients, renal structure was well preserved, whereas in the saline-treated group, tubular injury was severe, with marked tubular thinning, epithelial shedding, cast formation and necrosis. Inhibition of TLR2 also leads to a decrease in C3d deposition, although it is unclear whether this is due directly to TLR2 inhibition or a decrease in renal inflammation. This study shows that inhibition of TLR2 with a therapeutic agent (OPN301) provides significant protection from ischemia/reperfusion injury in a model of kidney transplantation.—Farrar, C.

https://openalex.org/W2051962913,"PRMT5 is a type II protein arginine methyltranferase that catalyzes monomethylation and symmetric dimethylation of arginine residues. PRMT5 is functionally involved in a variety of biological processes including embryo development and circadian clock regulation. However, the role of PRMT5 in oligodendrocyte differentiation and central nervous system myelination is unknown. Here we show that PRMT5 expression gradually increases throughout postnatal brain development, coinciding with the period of active myelination. PRMT5 expression was observed in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. siRNA-mediated depletion of PRMT5 in mouse primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells abrogated oligodendrocyte differentiation. In addition, the PRMT5-depleted oligodendrocyte progenitor and C6 glioma cells expressed high levels of the inhibitors of differentiation/DNA binding, Id2 and Id4, known repressors of glial cell differentiation. We observed that CpG-rich islands within the Id2 and Id4 genes were bound by PRMT5 and were hypomethylated in PRMT5-deficient cells, suggesting that PRMT5 plays a role in gene silencing during glial cell differentiation. Our findings define a role of PRMT5 in glial cell differentiation and link PRMT5 to epigenetic changes during oligodendrocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2084850533,"Caenorhabditis elegans FAT-2 has been characterized as fatty acid Δ12-desaturase able to desaturate C16 and C18 fatty acids. However, in this report we show that when expressed in yeast cells this enzyme can also catalyze Δ15 desaturation. This results in the production of both linoleic acid (ω6 C18:2Δ9,12) and linolenic acid (ω3 C18:3Δ9,12,15) from oleic acid (C18:1Δ9) substrate, and hexadecadienoic acid (ω4 C16:2Δ9,12) and hexadecatrienoic acid (ω1 C16:3Δ9,12,15) from palmitoleic acid (C16:1Δ9) substrate. In addition, this enzyme can also produce C14:2Δ9,12, C15:2Δ9,12, C17:2Δ9,12, and C18:4Δ6,9,12,15 when C14:1Δ9, C15:1Δ9, C17:1Δ9, and C18:3Δ6,9,12 substrates are available in yeast cells. Mass spectrometry analysis of 2,4-dimethyloxazoline modification of fatty acid methyl esters confirms the positions of all newly formed double bonds. These results indicate that when expressed in yeast the C. elegans Δ12-desaturase CeFAT-2 shows a characteristic of a bifunctional Δ12/Δ15-desaturase and has a great deal of elasticity with respect to fatty acid chain length in being able to accept fatty acids ranging from C14 to C18. Interestingly, despite possessing a bifunctional Δ12/Δ15 desaturation activity, phylogenetic analysis suggests that C. elegans Δ12-desaturase CeFAT-2 might have arisen independently from other reported dual Δ12/Δ15-desaturases from fungi and protozoa."
https://openalex.org/W2025953689,"Artemisinin (ART) is the recommended first line therapy for treating uncomplicated and drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, the most pathogenic form of malaria. However, treatment failure following ART monotherapy is not uncommon and resistance to this rapidly acting drug has been reported in the Thai-Cambodian border. Recent in vitro studies have shown that following treatment with dihydroartemisinin (DHA), the development of ring-stage parasites is arrested for up to 20 days. These arrested (i.e. dormant) rings could be responsible for the recrudescence of infection that is observed following ART monotherapy. To develop a better understanding of the stage-specific effects of ART and determine if dormancy occurs in vivo, the ART derivative artesunate (AS) was used to treat mice infected with the synchronous rodent malaria parasites P. vinckei petteri (non-lethal) and P. v. vinckei (lethal). Results show that in both the non-lethal and lethal strains, ring-stage parasites are the least susceptible to treatment with AS and that the day of treatment has more of an impact on recrudescence than the total dose administered. Additionally, 24 hrs post-treatment with AS, dormant forms similar in morphology to those seen in vitro were observed. Finally, rate of recrudescence studies suggest that there is a positive correlation between the number of dormant parasites present and when recrudescence occurs in the vertebrate host. Collectively, these data suggest that dormancy occurs in vivo and contributes to recrudescence that is observed following AS treatment. It is possible that this may represent a novel mechanism of parasite survival following treatment with AS."
https://openalex.org/W2006353424,"Background The analysis of gene expression data shows that many genes display similarity in their expression profiles suggesting some co-regulation. Here, we investigated the co-expression patterns in gene expression data and proposed a correlation-based research method to stratify individuals. Methodology/Principal Findings Using blood from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, we investigated the gene expression profiles from whole blood using Affymetrix microarray technology. Co-expressed genes were analyzed by a biclustering method, followed by gene ontology analysis of the relevant biclusters. Taking the type I interferon (IFN) pathway as an example, a classification algorithm was developed from the 102 RA patients and extended to 10 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and 100 healthy volunteers to further characterize individuals. We developed a correlation-based algorithm referred to as Classification Algorithm Based on a Biological Signature (CABS), an alternative to other approaches focused specifically on the expression levels. This algorithm applied to the expression of 35 IFN-related genes showed that the IFN signature presented a heterogeneous expression between RA, SLE and healthy controls which could reflect the level of global IFN signature activation. Moreover, the monitoring of the IFN-related genes during the anti-TNF treatment identified changes in type I IFN gene activity induced in RA patients. Conclusions In conclusion, we have proposed an original method to analyze genes sharing an expression pattern and a biological function showing that the activation levels of a biological signature could be characterized by its overall state of correlation."

However, the signaling pathways induced by these receptors remain largely unknown.

Phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) is a key component in B cell receptor signaling, but its role in other signaling pathways has not been fully characterized. Here, we show that PLCγ2 functions downstream of Dectin-2 in response to the stimulation by the hyphal form of Candida albicans, an opportunistic pathogenic fungus. Using PLCγ2- and PLCγ1-deficient macrophages, we found that the lack of PLCγ2, but not PLCγ1, impairs cytokine production in response to infection with C. albicans. PLCγ2 deficiency results in the defective activation of NF-κB and MAPK and a significantly reduced production of reactive oxygen species following fungal challenge. In addition, PLCγ2-deficient mice are defective in clearing C. albicans infection in vivo.

Invasive Candida albicans infection remains a serious clinical complication in patients with compromised immune systems. C. albicans is a dimorphic fungus, and its pathogenicity is dependent on both its yeast and filament-shaped hyphal forms, because mutants in either form are less virulent than wild-type strains (1Saville S.P.

It has been shown that the β-glucan layer in the C. albicans cell wall is usually buried by the mannoprotein coat in the yeast form but exposed when they transform into the hyphae under infection conditions (13Wheeler R.T. Fink G.R. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e35Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), which may interact with Dectin-1 and induce a strong immune response during an infection (14Wheeler R.T. Kombe D.

However, recent studies on Dectin-1-deficient mice suggest that there may be other redundant receptors mediating C. albicans infection-induced immune responses (15Taylor P.R. Tsoni S.V. Willment J.A.

In contrast, studies on Dectin-2-deficient mice suggest that Dectin-2 may play a more important role for the innate immune response against C. albicans infection (16Saijo S. Fujikado N. Furuta T.

Therefore, the signal transduction pathway induced by Dectin-2 is not fully characterized, and it remains to be determined whether Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 receptors share the same signaling pathway. Although the signaling pathways induced by Dectin-2 following C. albicans infection are not fully defined, previous studies indicate that stimulation of Dectin-2 as well as Dectin-1 by the cell wall components of C. albicans can activate the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) (10Rogers N.C.

Syk is a key component in the B cell receptor signaling pathway. However, whether other components in B cell receptor signaling pathway are also involved in Dectin-2 signaling pathway remains to be determined. PLCγ hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (20Wilde J.I. Watson S.P. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic cells, two isoforms of PLCγ, PLCγ1 and PLCγ2, are expressed. PLCγ2 is a key component in B cell receptor signaling pathway (21Wang D. Feng J. Wen R. Marine J.C. Sangster M.Y. Parganas E. Hoffmeyer A. Jackson C.W. Cleveland J.L. Murray P.J. Ihle J.N.

In dendritic cells, both PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 can be activated by the stimulation of β-glucan, zymosan, and curdlan, extracted from the cell wall of yeast (23Xu S. Huo J. Lee K.G. Kurosaki T. Lam K.P. J.

However, whether PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 are involved in Dectin-2 signaling pathways in response to C. albicans infection remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that PLCγ2 functions downstream of Dectin-2 receptor in response to fungal infection. Using PLCγ1- and PLCγ2-deficient mice, we show that PLCγ2 but not PLCγ1 plays an essential role in the immune responses to C. albicans infection by inducing expression of cytokines and generating reactive oxygen species.

PLCγ2- and PLCγ1-deficient mice were maintained in the Biological Resource Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin. CARD9-deficient mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center animal facility and were used at 8–16 weeks of age. Bone marrow cells from Myd88−/− and Dectin-1−/− mice were kindly provided by Dr. Shizuo Akira (Department of Host Defense, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University) and Dr. David Underhill (University of California at Los Angeles), respectively. All of the animal experiments were performed in compliance with the institutional guidelines and according to the protocol approved by the institutional animal use and care committees of the Medical College of Wisconsin and M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. To generate PLCg1f/f/Mx1Cre chimera mice, PLCg1-Floxed (PLCg1f/f) mice were bred with Mx1Cre mice (Jackson Laboratory stock 005673). For experiments, PLCg1+/+Mx1Cre mice and PLCg1f/fMx1Cre mice received intraperitoneal injections of 300 μg of poly(I·C) on days 1 and 3. The mice were sacrificed 14 days after the first injection. Bone marrow cells from these mice were harvested and injected into C57B6 wild-type mice irradiated with 11 gray (Gy). For PLCg2−/− chimera mice, similar procedures were performed. Two months after bone marrow transplantation, chimera mice were used for yeast infection experiments. Primary cultures of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) 2The abbreviations used are: BMDMbone marrow-derived macrophageROSreactive oxygen speciesMOImultiplicity of infectionBAPTA-AM1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester). were prepared as described previously (26Hsu Y.M.

Erythrocytes were removed from cells samples by subjecting the samples to hypotonic solution. The cells were cultured for 7 days in DMEM containing 20% FBS, 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and 30% conditioned medium from L929 cells expressing macrophage colony-stimulating factor.

Mouse bone marrow cells were infected with virus on days 1 and 3 and selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin on day 5 of culture. C. albicans (strain SC5314) was kindly provided by Dr. Michael C. Lorenz (Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Texas Medical School at Houston). A single colony of C. albicans was grown overnight at 30 °C in yeast peptone dextrose medium. The cells were washed three times with PBS and then used as live yeast. For hyphae, the washed yeast cells were resuspended in RPMI with 10% FCS, grown at 37 °C for 3 h, and washed in PBS. The hyphae were then used for live stimulations. For heat-inactivated yeast, yeast cells were heated at 65 °C for 1 h. For in vivo C. albicans infection, male mice aged at 8–14 weeks were injected with 2 × 105 or 1 × 106 live C. albicans in 0.3 ml of PBS (pH 7.4). Candidal burden was determined by killing the mice 42 h after infection and harvesting and homogenizing their kidneys, lungs, livers, and spleens. Fungal colony formation units were quantified by plating serial dilutions of the homogenized organs on yeast extract peptone dextrose agar. For histological analysis, the tissue sections were cut and stained for glycogen using periodic acid-Schiff or hematoxylin and eosin. For ROS production evaluation, 1 × 105 BMDMs were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution without phenol red. Then Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 100 μm luminol and 5 units of horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) were added to the cells, and the cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then stimulated with either hyphae (multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 2) or phorbol myristate acetate. ROS production was measured every 3 min using a luminometer. After BMDMs were stimulated with hyphae or yeast, their nuclear extracts were prepared. The resulted nuclear protein (5 μg) was incubated with 32 P-labeled NF-κB or Oct-1 probe (Promega) for 15 min at 25 °C and then subjected to PAGE and exposed to x-ray films. To determine whether C. albicans can activate PLCγ2 through Dectin-2 receptor in macrophages, we examined PLCγ2 phosphorylation in BMDMs after infecting them with C. albicans hyphae. Stimulation of BMDMs with C. albicans led to an inducible phosphorylation of PLCγ2 (Fig. 1A), indicating that PLCγ2 is activated in response to C. albicans infection. Because both Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 have been shown to be involved in antifungal innate immune response, we determined whether Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 are required for C. albicans hyphae-induced PLCγ2 activation using BMDMs treated with a specific shRNA to Dectin-2 or BMDMs from Dectin-1 knock-out mice. Consistent with previous findings that Dectin-2 but not Dectin-1 is involved in C. albicans hyphae-induced signal transduction, we found that PLCγ2 activation was dependent on Dectin-2 but not Dectin-1 (Fig. 1, B and C). These results indicate that although C. albicans hyphae may activate multiple receptors on macrophages, only Dectin-2 leads to activation of PLCγ2. We next sought to identify the PLCγ2-dependent signaling pathways in macrophages and determine whether these signaling pathways are redundant in response to the hyphal and yeast forms of C. albicans. Previous studies indicate that heat-inactivated yeast of C. albicans can activate Dectin-1 signaling pathway, whereas hyphae of C. albicans induces Dectin-2 pathway. Therefore, we examined the contribution of PLCγ2 in NF-κB activation induced by these signaling pathways and found that NF-κB activation induced by hyphae was defective in PLCγ2-deficient macrophages (Fig. 2A), indicating that PLCγ2 is a key component in Dectin-2 signaling pathway. Consistent with recent studies (23Xu S. Huo J. Lee K.G. Kurosaki T. Lam K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7038-7046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24Tassi I. Cella M. Castro I. Gilfillan S. Khan W.N. Colonna M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2009; 39: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), PLCγ2-deficient macrophages were also defective in NF-κB activation induced by the stimulation of heat-inactivated yeast (Fig. 2B) that activates Dectin-1 signaling pathway. Together, these data indicate that PLCγ2 functions downstream of both Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 receptors and mediates NF-κB activation induced by these receptors. Earlier studies suggest that TLR2 functionally cooperates with Dectin-1 to regulate cytokine production following fungal infection (29Brown G.D. Herre J. Williams D.L. Willment J.A. Marshall A.S. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 30Gantner B.N. Simmons R.M. Canavera S.J. Akira S. Underhill D.M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Because TLR2 can potently activate NF-κB through a MyD88-dependent pathway, we examined whether the MyD88-dependent pathway might also be involved in fungal infection-induced NF-κB activation. However, we have found that, unlike PLCγ2 deficiency, MyD88 deficiency does not affect C. albicans hyphae- and yeast-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2, C and D). Therefore, our data suggest that Dectin-1- and Dectin-2-induced NF-κB activation are mediated through a PLCγ2-dependent but TLR/MyD88-independent pathway. The regulation of the IKK complex in response to hyphae is likely mediated through at least two signaling events, in which a Syk-dependent pathway regulates the phosphorylation of IKKα/β, whereas the adaptor protein CARD9 regulates the ubiquitination of IKKγ in a Syk-independent manner (28Bi L. Gojestani S. Wu W. Hsu Y.M. Zhu J. Ariizumi K. Lin X. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 25969-25977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We next examined whether PLCγ2 regulates the phosphorylation of IKKα/β and found that the signal-induced phosphorylation of IKKα/β was defective in PLCγ2−/− but not in Card9−/− macrophages in response to hyphae stimulation (Fig. 2E). Because CARD9 forms a complex with Bcl10 following hyphae stimulation, we investigated whether the formation of this complex would be affected in the absence of PLCγ2. CARD9 was immunoprecipitated from WT and PLCγ2−/− macrophages that were stimulated with or without hyphae, and then the association of CARD9 with Bcl10 was examined. Interestingly, we found that PLCγ2 deficiency did not significantly affect the formation of the CARD9-Bcl10 complex in response to the stimulation of C. albicans hyphae (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that PLCγ2 is a critical enzyme downstream of Syk and regulates the IKK complex in a CARD9-independent manner. Previous studies show that stimulation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by C. albicans induces tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPKs (17Robinson M.J. Osorio F. Rosas M. Freitas R.P. Schweighoffer E. Gross O. Verbeek J.S. Ruland J. Tybulewicz V. Brown G.D. Moita L.F. Taylor P.R. Reis e Sousa C. J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 2037-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether MAPK activation is dependent on PLCγ2 following fungal infection. We found that the activation of ERK and JNK was completely defective in PLCγ2−/− BMDMs following the stimulation by hyphae (Fig. 3A), whereas the activation of p38 and AKT in WT and PLCγ2−/− BMDMs was comparable (Fig. 3A). Although C. albicans yeast could also induce ERK and JNK activation in WT cells, ERK activation was only partially defective in PLCγ2−/− BMDMs, whereas JNK activation was significantly decreased (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the activation of ERK and JNK in response to C. albicans hyphae is solely dependent on PLCγ2, whereas C. albicans yeast may induce ERK activation through two pathways, one of which is dependent on PLCγ2, whereas the other is PLCγ2-independent. Because PLCγ1, a homolog of PLCγ2, is highly expressed in macrophages, we would like to investigate whether PLCγ1 plays a role in antifungal innate immunity. To determine whether PLCγ1 is also involved in this fungal infection-induced signaling pathway, we obtained BMDMs from PLCγ1-conditional knock-out (PLCγ1F/F/MxCre) or its control (PLCγ1F/+/MxCre) mice and examined the MAPK activation following stimulation with C. albicans. Unlike PLCγ2-deficient cells, PLCγ1-deficient cells are not defective in C. albicans hyphae-induced ERK and IKK activation (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that PLCγ1 is not involved in Dectin-2 signaling pathway to induce anti-fungal innate immune responses. To determine the functional requirement of PLCγ2 in antifungal innate immune responses, we compared the levels of cytokine production in PLCγ2−/− macrophages with those in WT macrophages in response to the hyphal (Fig. 4, A–D) or yeast (Fig. 4, E–H) forms of C. albicans. We found that the production of TNFα, IL-10, IL-6, and IL-12p40 in PLCγ2-deficient BMDMs was significantly lower than that in WT BMDMs (Fig. 4). Because PLCγ1 is also expressed in macrophages and is activated in DCs following the stimulation by zymosan, the extract of yeast cell walls (10Rogers N.C. Slack E.C. Edwards A.D. Nolte M.A. Schulz O. Schweighoffer E. Williams D.L. Gordon S. Tybulewicz V.L. Brown G.D. Reis e Sousa C. Immunity. 2005; 22: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar), we decided to examine the role of PLCγ1 in cytokine production in BMDMs in response to the stimulation with C. albicans. We found that PLCγ1 deficiency did not affect cytokine production in BMDMs following the stimulation with C. albicans (Fig. 5). Together, these data indicate that PLCγ2 but not PLCγ1 plays an essential role in antifungal immune response in macrophages.FIGURE 5PLCγ1 is not required for cytokine production by C. albicans yeast and hyphae. BMDMs from MxCre/PLCg1fl/+ mice (WT, black bars) and MxCre/PLCg1fl/fl mice (PLCγ1−/−, white bars) were stimulated overnight with hyphae (MOI = 1) (A and B) or heat-killed C. albicans yeast (MOI = 5) (C and D). ELISA was used to measure the level of cytokines in these cultured media. The data are the means ± S.D. of triplicate wells and are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ROS production in phagocytes in response to C. albicans is important in antifungal host responses. In macrophages, the production of ROS in response to zymosan has been shown to be Syk-dependent (18Underhill D.M. Rossnagle E. Lowell C.A. Simmons R.M. Blood. 2005; 106: 2543-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Aside from Syk, the signaling components that are crucial to NADPH oxidase assembly in response to C. albicans stimulation remain to be identified. Because PLCγ enzymes were shown to link integrin-mediated adhesion to NADPH oxidase activation in neutrophils (31Graham D.B. Robertson C.M. Bautista J. Mascarenhas F. Diacovo M.J. Montgrain V. Lam S.K. Cremasco V. Dunne W.M. Faccio R. Coopersmith C.M. Swat W. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 3445-3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we decided to examine whether PLCγ2 is involved in ROS production in response to C. albicans infection. The hyphal form of C. albicans induced robust ROS production in WT BMDMs but not in PLCγ2−/− BMDMs (Fig. 6A), whereas phorbol myristate acetate could effectively induce ROS production in both WT and PLCγ2−/− cells (Fig. 6B). In contrast to PLCγ2−/− macrophages, WT and PLCγ1−/− BMDMs showed no significant difference in ROS production following hyphae stimulation (Fig. 6C). These data indicate that PLCγ2 but not PLCγ1 is an essential signaling component for ROS production in response to C. albicans hyphae and that loss of PLCγ2, therefore, impairs the initial step of fungal killing in macrophages and increases host susceptibility to C. albicans infection. Because activation of PLCγ2 induces diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which activate PKC and increase the level of intracellular calcium, we next examined how PLCγ2 is involved in the generation of ROS. Using the PKC inhibitor GF109203X and the calcium chelator Bapta-AM, we found that hyphae-induced ROS generation primarily depends on PKC activation, because treatment with PKC inhibitor significantly blocked ROS generation, whereas Bapta-AM only caused a modest decrease in ROS generation (supplemental Fig. S1). To evaluate the role of PLCγ2 in anti-fungal immunity in vivo, we sought to determine whether PLCγ2-deficient mice were highly susceptible to fungal infection. To avoid the influence of PLCγ2 deficiency in other cell types, we generated PLCγ2-deficient bone marrow chimera (PLCγ2-deficient chimera) by reconstituting γ-irradiated wild-type mice with the bone marrow from PLCγ2-deficient mice and control mice with the bone marrow from WT mice. We then intravenously injected C. albicans into control or PLCγ2-deficient chimera mice. High dose (1 × 106) injection of C. albicans resulted in the death of PLCγ2-deficient mice but not WT control mice within 24 h (data not shown). Given a low dose (2 × 105) injection of C. albicans, PLCγ2-deficient chimera mice were dead within 48 h, but WT mice survived for more than 5 days (Fig. 7A). Cytokine (IL-6) levels in the sera from PLCγ2-deficient mice were significantly decreased in response to C. albicans infection (Fig. 7B). To provide the quantitative assessment of C. albicans burdens, we sacrificed some of these mice 42 h after infection. The kidneys, lungs, livers, and spleens from these mice were collected. Some of these organs were homogenized, and the serial dilutions of the homogenized organs were plated on yeast extract peptone dextrose agar, and fungal colonies grown on these plates were counted and plotted (Fig. 7C). To visualize C. albicans in these organs, the tissue sections from some collected organs were stained with the periodic acid-Schiff. Compared with WT mice, PLCγ2-deficient mice had substantially higher levels of germinating hyphal C. albicans in the kidneys, lung, spleen, and liver (supplemental Fig. S2). Together, these results demonstrate that PLCγ2 plays an essential role in antifungal innate immune response in vivo. Recent work has highlighted the role of C-type lectin receptors, Dectin-1 and Dectin-2, as pattern recognition receptors for fungal infections. So far, Syk and CARD9 are the few known signaling components downstream of Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 receptors, which initiate signal transduction cascades in response to fungal infection. In this study, we demonstrate that PLCγ2 but not PLCγ1 is an essential signaling component in the Dectin-2 signaling pathway and mediates NF-κB and MAPK activation, leading to antifungal innate immune responses. Therefore, PLCγ2-deficient mice are highly susceptible to C. albicans infection. Previous studies show that TLR signaling may collaborate with Dectin-1 signaling to induce the inflammatory response (29Brown G.D. Herre J. Williams D.L. Willment J.A. Marshall A.S. Gordon S. J. Exp.

However, in this study, we have found that the stimulation by both C. albicans hyphae and heat-inactivated yeast can effectively activate NF-κB in MyD88-deficient cells but is defective in PLCγ2-deficient cells, indicating that NF-κB activation induced by both Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 receptors is TLR/MyD88-independent but PLCγ2-dependent. Therefore, our data indicate that previous results obtained by using zymosan are significantly different from the results obtained by using the fungal organism itself. In the classical NF-κB pathway, the activation of IKK complex requires the signal-induced phosphorylation of IKKα/β subunits, in addition to the K63-linked ubiquitination of the regulatory subunit IKKγ/NEMO for the degradation of the inhibitory IκBα proteins and the subsequent translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus (32Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 33Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar). Recent work from our lab demonstrated that Syk and the adaptor protein CARD9 cooperate in activating the IKK complex with CARD9 mediating IKK ubiquitination, whereas Syk is necessary for the phosphorylation of IKKα/β subunits (28Bi L. Gojestani S. Wu W. Hsu Y.M. Zhu J. Ariizumi K. Lin X. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 25969-25977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the current study, we find that PLCγ2−/− macrophages are defective in the activation of IKKα/β, whereas Card9−/− macrophages are not. In addition, PLCγ2 deficiency did not alter the formation of the CARD9-BCL10 complex. These findings suggest that although PLCγ2 and CARD9 are both required for NF-κB activation in response to C. albicans (34Slack E.C. Robinson M.J. Hernanz-Falcón P. Brown G.D. Williams D.L. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V.L. Reis e Sousa C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37: 1600-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), they mediate their signaling in an independent manner. However, it remains to be determined which signaling components are required for linking CARD9 to the upstream signaling cascade. The mechanism that couples ERK activation to upstream signaling in Candida-induced responses is not well understood. We find that ERK activation in response to hyphae is completely abrogated, whereas ERK activation in response to yeast is partially defective in PLCγ2-deficient cells. This result suggests that the ERK activation induced by hyphal form of C. albicans is through a PLCγ2-dependent pathway, whereas yeast form of C. abicans may stimulate both PLCγ2-dependent and -independent pathways leading to ERK activation. Because PLCγ2 is downstream of Syk, our results are consistent with an earlier observation that zymosan-induced ERK activation is dependent on Syk in macrophages and DCs (34Slack E.C. Robinson M.J. Hernanz-Falcón P. Brown G.D. Williams D.L. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V.L. Reis e Sousa C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37: 1600-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, a recent study using human macrophages suggests that zymosan-induced ERK activation is mediated through a PLCγ2-independent, but a Syk-CaMK-Pyk2-dependent pathway (35Kelly E.K. Wang L. Ivashkiv L.B. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 5545-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These different results may be due to differences between using zymosan versus the fungal organism or to species-specific differences between human and mouse macrophages. It is well established that the Grb2-SOS-Ras-Raf1 signaling cascade leads to a potent ERK activation. Upon receptor engagement, SOS, a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is recruited to the membrane by the adaptor protein Grb2 leading to Ras activation (36Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 37Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Activated Ras can then activate the Raf-1 kinase, which will ultimately activate ERK1 and ERK2 kinases (38Hirasawa N. Scharenberg A. Yamamura H. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10960-10967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 39Turner H. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that C. albicans yeast, but not hyphae, may also activate the Grb2/SOS/Ras/Raf1 signaling cascade, which may explain the partial defect of ERK activation. We will test this hypothesis in our future studies. In contrast to ERK activation, JNK activation is significantly reduced in PLCγ2-deficient cells following the stimulation by both yeast and hyphae, indicating that JNK is activated through the same PLCγ2-dependent pathway by the stimulation of yeast and hyphae. Because our preliminary studies found that calcium chelator Bapta-AM and PKC inhibitor could not block the JNK activation in response to fungal infection (data not shown), it suggests that JNK is activated through an unknown pathway that is independent of PKC and calcium. Future studies are needed to reveal this signaling cascade following fungal infection. The phagocytosis of β-glucans in macrophages can activate the production of ROS (4Gantner B.N. Simmons R.M. Underhill D.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Although Syk is not involved in controlling phagocytosis, it is required for ROS production following fungal infection (18Underhill D.M. Rossnagle E. Lowell C.A. Simmons R.M. Blood. 2005; 106: 2543-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). However, CARD9, another known component in the C-type lectin pathway, is only partially required for fungal infection-induced ROS production (27Wu W. Hsu Y.M. Bi L. Songyang Z. Lin X. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism by which fungal infection triggers ROS production remains largely unknown. In the current study, we provide evidence that PLCγ2 but not PLCγ1 is necessary for ROS production in macrophages in response to stimulation with C. albicans. Although it remains to be determined how PLCγ2 links to ROS production, our data suggest that PLCγ2-dependent PKC activation is a critical link, because PKC has been shown to regulate ROS production, and inhibition of PKC significantly blocks ROS production following fungal infection (supplemental Fig. S1). Future studies will determine which isoform(s) of PKC are involved in fungal infection-induced ROS production. In addition, ROS production in DCs has been shown to be required for C. albicans-induced inflammasome activation (40Gross O. Poeck H. Bscheider M. Dostert C. Hannesschläger N. Endres S. Hartmann G. Tardivel A. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V. Mocsai A. Tschopp J. Ruland J. Nature. 2009; 459: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Therefore, our findings suggest a possible role for PLCγ2 in Nlrp3 inflammasome activation. This hypothesis will be tested in the future studies. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PLCγ2 is a critical component of Dectin-2 signaling and mediates anti-fungal innate immune responses. We thank Dr. Michael C.

https://openalex.org/W2078725156,"Background Natural killer (NK) cells have both cytolytic and immunoregulatory functions. We recently described that these cells release the inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IFN-γ. However, the precise identity of the NK cell subset(s) that secrete these cytokines is not known. Methodology/Principal Findings To isolate the cells secreting IL-17 and IFN-γ, we took advantage of the findings that Th17/Th1 cells express chemokine receptors. Therefore, CD56+NK cells were stained with antibodies against various chemokine receptors and intracellularly with antibodies toward IL-17 and IFN-γ. Consequently, we identified previously unrecognized subset of NK cells generated from normal human peripheral blood after activation with IL-2 but not PMA plus ionomycin. The cells are characterized by the expression of CD56+ and CCR4+, produce IL-17 and IFN-γ and are consequently named NK17/NK1 cells. They also express CD161, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, NKG2D, CD158, CCL22, IL-2Rβ and the common γ chain but not CD127 or IL-23R. Further, they possess T-bet and RORγt transcription factors. Antibodies to IL-1β, IL-6, IL-21, or TGF-β1 do not inhibit IL-2-induced generation of NK17/NK1 cells, suggesting that IL-2 has the capacity to polarize these cells. Notably, NK17/NK1 cells are abundant in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) without activation, and are generated from the peripheral blood of these patients after activation with IL-2. Conclusions/Significance NK17/NK1 cells identified here have not been previously described in healthy or MS patients."
https://openalex.org/W1979490144,"Twin-arginine translocation (Tat) is a unique protein transport pathway in bacteria, archaea, and plastids. It mediates the transmembrane transport of fully folded proteins, which harbor a consensus twin-arginine motif in their signal sequences. In Gram-negative bacteria and plant chloroplasts, three membrane proteins, named TatA, TatB, and TatC, are required to enable Tat translocation. Available data suggest that TatA assembles into oligomeric pore-like structures that might function as the protein conduit across the lipid bilayer. Using site-specific photo-cross-linking, we have investigated the molecular environment of TatA under resting and translocating conditions. We find that monomeric TatA is an early interacting partner of functionally targeted Tat substrates. This interaction with TatA likely precedes translocation of Tat substrates and is influenced by the proton-motive force. It strictly depends on the presence of TatB and TatC, the latter of which is shown to make contacts with the transmembrane helix of TatA."
https://openalex.org/W2148817870,"Indo-Pacific high island streams experience extreme hydrological variation, and are characterised by freshwater fish species with an amphidromous life history. Amphidromy is a likely adaptation for colonisation of island streams following stochastic events that lead to local extirpation. In the Wet Tropics of north-eastern Australia, steep coastal mountain streams share similar physical characteristics to island systems. These streams are poorly surveyed, but may provide suitable habitat for amphidromous species. However, due to their ephemeral nature, common non-diadromous freshwater species of continental Australia are unlikely to persist. Consequently, we hypothesise that coastal Wet Tropics streams are faunally more similar, to distant Pacific island communities, than to nearby faunas of large continental rivers.Surveys of coastal Wet Tropics streams recorded 26 species, 10 of which are first records for Australia, with three species undescribed. This fish community is unique in an Australian context in that it contains mostly amphidromous species, including sicydiine gobies of the genera Sicyopterus, Sicyopus, Smilosicyopus and Stiphodon. Species presence/absence data of coastal Wet Tropics streams were compared to both Wet Tropics river networks and Pacific island faunas. ANOSIM indicated the fish fauna of north-eastern Australian coastal streams were more similar to distant Pacific islands (R = 0.76), than to nearby continental rivers (R = 0.98).Coastal Wet Tropics streams are faunally more similar to distant Pacific islands (79% of species shared), than to nearby continental fauna due to two factors. First, coastal Wet Tropics streams lack many non-diadromous freshwater fish which are common in nearby large rivers. Second, many amphidromous species found in coastal Wet Tropics streams and Indo-Pacific islands remain absent from large rivers of the Wet Tropics. The evolutionary and conservation significance of this newly discovered Australian fauna requires clarification in the context of the wider amphidromous fish community of the Pacific."

Therefore, we proposed whether there is interplay between the ascorbate transport system and NO signaling pathway in retinal cells. Here we show compelling evidence that ascorbate uptake is tightly controlled by NO and its downstream signaling pathway in culture. NO also modulates the expression of SVCT-2, an effect mediated by cGMP and PKG.

https://openalex.org/W2009911619,"Inhalation of quartz induces silicosis, a lung disease where alveolar macrophages release inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-a). Here we report the pivotal role of abscisic acid (ABA), a recently discovered human inflammatory hormone, in silica-induced activation of murine RAW264.7 macrophages and of rat alveolar macrophages (AMs). Stimulation of both RAW264.7 cells and AMs with quartz induced a significant increase of ABA release (5- and 10-fold, respectively), compared to untreated cells. In RAW264.7 cells, autocrine ABA released after quartz stimulation sequentially activates the plasma membrane receptor LANCL2 and NADPH oxidase, generating a Ca2+ influx resulting in NFκ B nuclear translocation and PGE2 and TNF-α release (3-, 2-, and 3.5-fold increase, respectively, compared to control, unstimulated cells). Quartz-stimulated RAW264.7 cells silenced for LANCL2 or preincubated with a monoclonal antibody against ABA show an almost complete inhibition of NFκ B nuclear translocation and PGE2 and TNF-α release compared to controls electroporated with a scramble oligonucleotide or preincubated with an unrelated antibody. AMs showed similar early and late ABA-induced responses as RAW264.7 cells. These findings identify ABA and LANCL2 as key mediators in quartz-induced inflammation, providing possible new targets for antisilicotic therapy.—Magnone, M., Sturla, L., Jacchetti, E., Scarfì, S., Bruzzone, S., Usai, C., Guida, L., Salis, A., Damonte, G., De Flora, A., Zocchi, E.

https://openalex.org/W2095009612,"Conservation strategies for long-lived vertebrates require accurate estimates of parameters relative to the populations' size, numbers of non-breeding individuals (the ""cryptic"" fraction of the population) and the age structure. Frequently, visual survey techniques are used to make these estimates but the accuracy of these approaches is questionable, mainly because of the existence of numerous potential biases. Here we compare data on population trends and age structure in a bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) population from visual surveys performed at supplementary feeding stations with data derived from population matrix-modelling approximations. Our results suggest that visual surveys overestimate the number of immature (<2 years old) birds, whereas subadults (3-5 y.o.) and adults (>6 y.o.) were underestimated in comparison with the predictions of a population model using a stable-age distribution. In addition, we found that visual surveys did not provide conclusive information on true variations in the size of the focal population. Our results suggest that although long-term studies (i.e. population matrix modelling based on capture-recapture procedures) are a more time-consuming method, they provide more reliable and robust estimates of population parameters needed in designing and applying conservation strategies. The findings shown here are likely transferable to the management and conservation of other long-lived vertebrate populations that share similar life-history traits and ecological requirements."
https://openalex.org/W2160319996,"Understanding the interaction between the nervous system and cerebral vasculature is fundamental to forming a complete picture of the neurophysiology of sleep and its role in maintaining physiological homeostasis. However, the intrinsic hemodynamics of slow-wave sleep (SWS) are still poorly known. We carried out 30 all-night sleep measurements with combined near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and polysomnography to investigate spontaneous hemodynamic behavior in SWS compared to light (LS) and rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM). In particular, we concentrated on slow oscillations (3–150 mHz) in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations, heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, and the pulsation amplitude of the photoplethysmographic signal. We also analyzed the behavior of these variables during sleep stage transitions. The results indicate that slow spontaneous cortical and systemic hemodynamic activity is reduced in SWS compared to LS, REM, and wakefulness. This behavior may be explained by neuronal synchronization observed in electrophysiological studies of SWS and a reduction in autonomic nervous system activity. Also, sleep stage transitions are asymmetric, so that the SWS-to-LS and LS-to-REM transitions, which are associated with an increase in the complexity of cortical electrophysiological activity, are characterized by more dramatic hemodynamic changes than the opposite transitions. Thus, it appears that while the onset of SWS and termination of REM occur only as gradual processes over time, the termination of SWS and onset of REM may be triggered more abruptly by a particular physiological event or condition. The results suggest that scalp hemodynamic changes should be considered alongside cortical hemodynamic changes in NIRS sleep studies to assess the interaction between the autonomic and central nervous systems."

However, those bacteria specifically adapted to degrade cellulose, the major structural component of plant biomass, represent a fraction of the rumen microbiome. Previously, we proposed scaC as a candidate for phylotyping Ruminococcus flavefaciens, one of three major cellulolytic bacterial species isolated from the rumen. In the present report we examine the dynamics and diversity of scaC-types both within and between cattle temporally, following a dietary switch from corn-silage to grass-legume hay. These results were placed in the context of the overall bacterial population dynamics measured using the 16S rRNA.As many as 117 scaC-types were estimated, although just nineteen were detected in each of three rumens tested, and these collectively accounted for the majority of all types present. Variation in scaC populations was observed between cattle, between planktonic and fiber-associated fractions and temporally over the six-week survey, and appeared related to scaC phylogeny. However, by the sixth week no significant separation of scaC populations was seen between animals, suggesting enrichment of a constrained set of scaC-types. Comparing the amino-acid translation of each scaC-type revealed sequence variation within part of the predicted dockerin module but strong conservation in the N-terminus, where the cohesin module is located.The R. flavefaciens species comprises a multiplicity of scaC-types in-vivo. Enrichment of particular scaC-types temporally, following a dietary switch, and between fractions along with the phylogenetic congruence suggests that functional differences exist between types. Observed differences in dockerin modules suggest at least part of the functional heterogeneity may be conferred by scaC. The polymorphic nature of scaC enables the relative distribution of R. flavefaciens strains to be examined and represents a gene-centric approach to investigating the intraspecific adaptation of an important specialist population."
https://openalex.org/W2079046798,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has offered a promising approach for controlling HIV-1 replication in infected individuals. However, with HARRT, HIV-1 is suppressed rather than eradicated due to persistence of HIV-1 in latent viral reservoirs. Thus, purging the virus from latent reservoirs is an important strategy toward eradicating HIV-1 infection. In this study, we discovered that the daphnane diterpene gnidimacrin, which was previously reported to have potent anti-cancer cell activity, activated HIV-1 replication and killed persistently-infected cells at picomolar concentrations. In addition to its potential to purge HIV-1 from latently infected cells, gnidimacrin potently inhibited a panel of HIV-1 R5 virus infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at an average concentration lower than 10 pM. In contrast, gnidimacrin only partially inhibited HIV-1 ×4 virus infection of PBMCs. The strong anti-HIV-1 R5 virus activity of gnidimacrin was correlated with its effect on down-regulation of the HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5. The anti-R5 virus activity of gnidimacrin was completely abrogated by a selective protein kinase C beta inhibitor enzastaurin, which suggests that protein kinase C beta plays a key role in the potent anti-HIV-1 activity of gnidimacrin in PBMCs. In summary, these results suggest that gnidimacrin could activate latent HIV-1, specifically kill HIV-1 persistently infected cells, and inhibit R5 viruses at picomolar concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2021897675,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, late-onset movement disorder with selective degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Although the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) has been used to induce progressive degeneration of DA neurons in various animal models of PD, the precise molecular pathway and the impact of anti-apoptotic treatment on this neurodegeneration are less understood. Following a striatal injection of 6-OHDA, we observed atrophy and progressive death of DA neurons in wild-type mice. These degenerating DA neurons never exhibited signs of apoptosis (i.e., caspase-3 activation and cytoplasmic release of cytochrome C), but rather show nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), a hallmark of regulated necrosis. However, mice with genetic deletion of the proapoptotic gene Bax (Bax-KO) exhibited a complete absence of 6-OHDA-induced DA neuron death and nuclear translocation of AIF, indicating that 6-OHDA-induced DA neuronal death is mediated by Bax-dependent AIF activation. On the other hand, DA neurons that survived in Bax-KO mice exhibited marked neuronal atrophy, without significant improvement of PD-related behavioral deficits. These findings suggest that anti-apoptotic therapy may not be sufficient for PD treatment, and the prevention of Bax-independent neuronal atrophy may be an important therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2053376896,"Background Campylobacter jejuni is the major cause of human bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide, and in a minority of cases, post-infectious complications may occur. ST-22 complex (usually Penner serotype 19) strains have been overrepresented among patients with postinfectious complications of campylobacteriosis. We here present a characterization of a collection of 27 Finnish C. jejuni strains of ST-22 complex, from humans (22 strains) and animal sources (five strains), with the aim of contributing to our knowledge of the pathogenesis of C. jejuni infections. Methodology/Principal Findings All strains were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) genotyping, lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS) locus class, Y-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) activity, in vitro biofilm formation ability, invasion and adhesion in HeLa cells and induction of IL-8 production. ST-22 complex contained five STs (ST-22; ST-1947; ST-1966; ST-3892; ST-3996) which were homogeneous in having sialylated LOS class A1 but on the other hand were distinguished into two major lineages according to the major STs (ST-22 and ST-1947) by different PFGE genotypes and certain other characteristics. All ST-22 strains had similar SmaI PFGE profiles, were GGT positive, and formed biofilms, except one strain, while ST-1947 strains were all GGT negative, did not form biofilm, had significantly higher motility than ST-22 (p<0.05) and had their SmaI PFGE profile. Invasion and adhesion as well as induction of IL-8 production on HeLa cells were strain-dependent characteristics. Conclusions/Significance ST-22 complex strains, reveal potential for molecular mimicry in host interactions upon infection as they all express sialylated LOS class A1. The two major STs, ST-22 and ST-1947 formed two homogeneous lineages, which differed from each other both phenotypically and genetically, suggesting that the strains may have evolved separately, perhaps by interacting with different spectra of hosts. Further studies are needed in order to understand if these two lineages are associated with different disease outcomes."

There are two key prerequisites for the transport of substrate proteins via Tat. First, these proteins need to have an N-terminal signal peptide with a characteristic twin arginine (RR- motif (K/R)RXFLK (9Chaddock A.M. Mant A. Karnauchov I. Brink S. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B.

This RR-signal peptide facilitates precursor targeting to the Tat translocase and initiation of the translocation process. Second, the substrate protein needs to be presented to the Tat translocase in a folded state (16DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These translocases are composed of three subunits, TatA, TatB, and TatC, all of which are of critical importance for translocation activity. TatABC-type translocases are also present in the chloroplast thylakoidal membrane (22Dabney-Smith C. Cline K. Mol. Biol.

Although the precise modes of action of TatABC and TatAC translocases have not yet been fully elucidated, the consensus mechanistic model envisages that the RR motif in signal peptides is recognized by a TatBC receptor complex in Gram-negative bacteria or a TatAC receptor complex in Gram-positive bacteria (29Jongbloed J.D. van der Ploeg R. van Dijl J.M.

The TatBC or TatAC precursor complexes would subsequently associate with TatA complexes that co-exist as separate entities in the membrane. This in turn would lead to the formation of a flexible channel composed of multiple TatA subunits, facilitating membrane passage of substrate proteins that can range in diameter from ∼20 to ∼70 Å (33Cline K.

The proton-motive force is believed to strengthen the signal peptide-receptor complex interaction and to drive protein translocation across the membrane (33Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 34Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 37Gérard F. Cline K. J. Biol.

In certain bacteria, such as the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, multiple paralogues of TatA or TatC are present. Specifically, B. subtilis contains two TatAC systems named TatAdCd and TatAyCy that are encoded by the tatAd-tatCd and tatAy-tatCy operons (25Jongbloed J.D. Martin U. Antelmann H. Hecker M.

The TatAdCd and TatAyCy translocases have different but overlapping specificities, and their usage is strongly dependent on growth conditions. Under conditions of phosphate starvation, the TatAdCd translocase is responsible for secretion of the phosphodiesterase PhoD, whereas TatAyCy is dispensable for this process (25Jongbloed J.D. Martin U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Müller J. J. Biol.

Conversely, when cells are cultivated in the standard Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, the TatAyCy translocase secretes the Dyp-type peroxidase YwbN without any detectable involvement of TatAdCd (28Jongbloed J.D.

Interestingly, both TatAC translocases from B. subtilis are capable of transporting hybrid precursors consisting of RR signal peptides from Escherichia coli fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (42Barnett J.P. van der Ploeg R.

The structure-function relationships in the TatA and TatB subunits of the TatABC translocase from E. coli have been studied in great detail (43Barrett C.M. Robinson C.

In contrast, relatively little is known about the bifunctional TatA subunits that are part of the TatAC translocases of Gram-positive bacteria. An initial mutagenesis screen of several conserved residues in the N-terminal part of the TatAd protein has identified a number of residues that are important for its bifunctional activity when heterologously expressed in E. coli (50Barnett J.P. Lawrence J. Mendel S. Robinson C. Arch. Microbiol. 2011; 193: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This prompted us to assess the functions of conserved residues in the B. subtilis TatAy protein by site-specific mutagenesis. To monitor the activity of translocases with mutated TatAy subunits in B. subtilis, we used the secreted YwbN protein as a reporter. An additional advantage of using TatAy for mutagenesis studies is that TatAyCy-dependent YwbN secretion is required for achieving wild-type growth rates and survival upon entry in the stationary phase when B. subtilis cells are grown in LB medium lacking NaCl (40van der Ploeg R. Mäder U. Homuth G. Schaffer M. Denham E.L. Monteferrante C.G. Miethke M. Marahiel M.A. Harwood C.R. Winter T. Hecker M. Antelmann H. van Dijl J.M. PLoS One. 2011; 6e18140Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This relates to a critical role of YwbN in the acquisition of iron under these conditions. The present studies identify several residues that are critical for TatAy activity when B. subtilis cells are grown in the standard LB medium with 1% NaCl. The inactive mutated TatAy proteins were all capable of assembling into TatAy and TatAyCy complexes when produced in E. coli, and in this organism most of them facilitated membrane association (though not full translocation) of a hybrid RR precursor protein. These findings indicated that the respective mutations did not primarily interfere with TatAyCy complex formation but rather with the translocation activity of TatAyCy complexes. All mutated TatAy proteins facilitated at least low levels of YwbN secretion in B. subtilis cells grown in LB medium without added NaCl. The latter experiment revealed that most of the respective mutated TatAyCy translocases were salt-sensitive. Equally surprising, additional experiments revealed that the TatAC translocases from Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus were also salt-sensitive when expressed in B. subtilis. Taken together, our findings imply that certain TatAC translocases are intrinsically salt-sensitive, which suggests critical roles for electrostatic interactions in their preprotein translocation activity. Strains and plasmids are listed in Table 1. The standard LB medium that was also used in all our previous studies contained Bacto Tryptone (1%), Bacto yeast extract (0.5%), and NaCl (1%). For some experiments NaCl was omitted from the LB medium (“no NaCl”). When required, media for E. coli were supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml−1), erythromycin (100 μg ml−1), kanamycin (20 μg ml−1), chloramphenicol (5 μg ml−1), or spectinomycin (100 μg ml−1); media for B. subtilis were supplemented with erythromycin (2 μg ml−1), kanamycin (20 μg ml−1), chloramphenicol (5 μg ml−1), or spectinomycin (100 μg ml−1).TABLE 1Strains and plasmidsE. coli DH5αsupE44 ΔlacU169 (Ф80lacZΔM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1(51Sambrook J.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals or New England Biolabs. B. subtilis was transformed as described (52Kunst F. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2403-2407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR was carried out with Pwo DNA polymerase. All constructs were sequenced to confirm correctness. Particular codons in tatAy were replaced by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR primers with one or more nucleotide changes. Supplemental Table 1 lists the primers used in this study. In a first PCR the 5′ part of tatAy was amplified using the forward primer JW01Ay2 and a reverse primer specifying one or two nucleotide changes in tatAy. The resulting PCR product was purified using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals PCR purification kit. This PCR product was then used as a forward primer with JW04Cy2 as the reverse primer to create a second PCR product, specifying the complete tatAyCy operon with a mutant tatAy gene. Mutant taAyCy operons were cloned in pUC18, and the correctness of the amplified sequences was verified. For expression and activity studies in B. subtilis, the mutant tatAyCy operons were excised from pUC18 using HindII and EcoRI and ligated into the SmaI and EcoRI restriction sites of the E. coli-B. subtilis shuttle vector pHB201. To study TatAyCy complex formation in E. coli, mutant tatAyCy operons were transferred to pBAD24. For this purpose, the mutant tatAyCy operons were amplified by PCR with a 3′ primer specifying a Strep-II tag that is coupled to the C terminus of TatCy. The resulting PCR products were cleaved with BsmBI and XbaI and ligated to pBAD24 that had been cleaved with BsmBI and NcoI. To study TatAyCy-facilitated export of a hybrid precursor composed of the RR signal peptide of E. coli MdoD fused to the green fluorescent protein (MdoD-GFP) in E. coli, the low expression vector pEXT22 was used. To this end, the mutant tatAyCy operons were amplified by PCR, cleaved with HindIII and EcoRI, and ligated to HindIII-EcoRI-cleaved pEXT22. Primers for amplification of the tatAC genes from B. cereus, L. monocytogenes EGD, and S. aureus RN4220 were designed from the respective genome sequences as deposited in the NCBI data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; supplemental Table 1). The amplified PCR products were cloned in pUC18 or pTOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. For expression in B. subtilis, correctly amplified tatAC genes from B. cereus and S. aureus were cloned in the EcoRI site of pHB201. The fragment with the L. monocytogenes tatAC operon was cleaved with BamHI and XhoI and ligated to pHB201 cleaved with the same enzymes. B. subtilis strains lacking the tatAyCy genes were transformed with pHB201 plasmids carrying tatAyCy genes from B. subtilis (wild type or mutant), B. cereus, S. aureus, or L. monocytogenes. To monitor the activity of pHB201-encoded TatAC translocases, the XywbN-Myc cassette was integrated in the amyE locus, allowing xylose-inducible expression of Myc-tagged YwbN. Secretion of YwbN-Myc was assessed by transferring cells from an overnight culture to fresh medium. After 3 h of growth in fresh medium at 37 °C, YwbN-Myc expression was induced by the addition of 1% xylose and 0.5 m δ-aminolevulinic acid to the cultures. Growth was continued for 3 h, and then cells and growth medium fractions were separated by centrifugation. Cells were broken by bead beating. Proteins in the medium were concentrated 20-fold upon precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. The presence of YwbN-Myc in the different fractions was monitored by Western blotting and immunodetection. The activity of mutated TatAyCy translocases expressed in E. coli was assessed by monitoring the export of MdoD-GFP as previously described (42Barnett J.P. van der Ploeg R. Eijlander R.T. Nenninger A. Mendel S. Rozeboom R. Kuipers O.P. van Dijl J.M. Robinson C. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For these experiments, TatAyCy was expressed from pEXT22 and MdoD-GFP from pBAD24. Cell fractionation into cytoplasmic, periplasmic, and membrane fractions was performed as described (42Barnett J.P. van der Ploeg R. Eijlander R.T. Nenninger A. Mendel S. Rozeboom R. Kuipers O.P. van Dijl J.M. Robinson C. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The presence of GFP in the different fractions was monitored by Western blotting and immunodetection. The presence of the TatAy, YwbN-Myc, or GroEL proteins in cellular and growth medium fractions of B. subtilis was monitored by Western blotting. Protein samples for SDS-PAGE were prepared with loading buffer containing reducing agent (Invitrogen). After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by semidry blotting (1 h and 15 min; 1 mA cm−2). For detection of YwbN-Myc, monoclonal Myc-specific antibodies from Gentaur were used. TatAy and GroEL were detected using specific polyclonal antibodies (Eurogentec). Antibody detection was performed with fluorescent IgG secondary antibodies (IRDye 800 CW goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse from LiCor Biosciences) in combination with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LiCor Biosciences). Densitometric image analysis to quantify relative protein amounts as detected by Western blotting was performed with the program ImageJ (rsbweb.nih.gov). The presence of TatAy and GFP in subcellular fractions of E. coli was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using specific polyclonal antibodies against TatAy (Eurogentec) and GFP (Promega, Living Colors). Bound antibodies were visualized with goat anti-rabbit IgG horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Likewise, the presence of TatCy-Strep-II was detected by Western blotting using a Streptactin-HRP conjugate (Institut fur Bioanalytik) and the ECL detection kit. B. subtilis strains were precultured in LB medium containing 1% NaCl and subsequently diluted in LB medium with no NaCl or 1% NaCl to an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of ∼0.01. Growth was continued in a 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc) that was incubated in a Biotek Synergy 2 plate reader (37 °C, variable shaking). A600 readings were recorded for 15 h. E. coli ΔtatABCDE cells containing the mutant tatAyCy operons on the pBAD24 plasmid were grown aerobically to mid-exponential phase with induction of the tatAyCy genes using 0.5 mm arabinose. Cells were fractionated into membrane and cytosolic components as described previously, and the membranes were solubilized in 2% digitonin (32Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C.M.

To analyze TatAyCy complexes, the solubilized membranes were incubated with 2 μg/ml avidin to block any biotin-containing proteins before application to an equilibrated 4-ml Streptactin affinity column (Institut fur Bioanalytik). The column was washed with 8 column volumes of equilibration buffer containing Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% digitonin. Bound protein was eluted from the column in 6 × 2.0 ml fractions using the same buffer as above but containing 3 mm desthiobiotin (Sigma). For gel filtration experiments, affinity-purified TatAyCy was concentrated to 250 μl using Vivaspin-4 centrifugal concentrators (molecular weight cutoff 10,000; Vivascience). The concentrated sample was loaded onto a Superose-6HR gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with the equilibration buffer described above (32Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D.

https://openalex.org/W1984270295,"This study examined the ability of P.falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IE) to induce a pro-adhesive environment in the host endothelium during malaria infection, prior to the systemic cytokine activation seen in the later phase of disease. Previous work had shown increases in receptor levels but had not measured to actual impact on IE binding. Using a co-culture system with a range of endothelial cells (EC) and IE with different cytoadherent properties, we have characterised the specific expression of adhesion receptors and subsequent IE binding by FACS and adhesion assays. We have also examined the specific signalling pathways induced during co-culture that are potentially involved in the induction of receptor expression. The results confirmed that ICAM-1 is up-regulated, albeit at much lower levels than seen with TNF activation, in response to co-culture with infected erythrocytes in all three tissue endothelial cell types tested but that up-regulation of VCAM-1 is tissue-dependent. This small increase in the levels of EC receptors correlated with large changes in IE adhesion ability. Co-culture with either RBC or IE increased the potential of subsequent adhesion indicating priming/modulation effects on EC which make them more susceptible to adhesion and thereby the recruitment of IE. Trypsin surface digestion of IE and the use of a Pfsbp1-knockout (ko) parasite line abrogated the up-regulation of ICAM-1 and reduced IE binding to EC suggesting that PfEMP-1 and other molecules exported to the IE surface via the PfSBP1 pathway are major mediators of this phenotype. This was also supported by the higher induction of EC adhesion receptors by adherent IE compared to isogenic, non-adherent lines."
https://openalex.org/W2058395097,"The lateral habenula (LHb) is a brain structure which represents negative motivational value. Neurons in the LHb are excited by unpleasant events such as reward omission and aversive stimuli, and transmit these signals to midbrain dopamine neurons which are involved in learning and motivation. However, it remains unclear whether these phasic changes in LHb neuronal activity actually influence animal behavior. To answer this question, we artificially activated the LHb by electrical stimulation while monkeys were performing a visually guided saccade task. In one block of trials, saccades to one fixed direction (e.g., right direction) were followed by electrical stimulation of the LHb while saccades to the other direction (e.g., left direction) were not. The direction-stimulation contingency was reversed in the next block. We found that the post-saccadic stimulation of the LHb increased the latencies of saccades in subsequent trials. Notably, the increase of the latency occurred gradually as the saccade was repeatedly followed by the stimulation, suggesting that the effect of the post-saccadic stimulation was accumulated across trials. LHb stimulation starting before saccades, on the other hand, had no effect on saccade latency. Together with previous studies showing LHb activation by reward omission and aversive stimuli, the present stimulation experiment suggests that LHb activity contributes to learning to suppress actions which lead to unpleasant events."
https://openalex.org/W2119852931,"The gram-negative, zoonotic pathogen Bartonella henselae (Bhe) translocates seven distinct Bartonella effector proteins (Beps) via the VirB/VirD4 type IV secretion system (T4SS) into human cells, thereby interfering with host cell signaling [1], [2]. In particular, the effector protein BepG alone or the combination of effector proteins BepC and BepF trigger massive F-actin rearrangements that lead to the establishment of invasome structures eventually resulting in the internalization of entire Bhe aggregates [2], [3]. In this report, we investigate the molecular function of the effector protein BepF in the eukaryotic host cell. We show that the N-terminal [E/T]PLYAT tyrosine phosphorylation motifs of BepF get phosphorylated upon translocation but do not contribute to invasome-mediated Bhe uptake. In contrast, we found that two of the three BID domains of BepF are capable to trigger invasome formation together with BepC, while a mutation of the WxxxE motif of the BID-F1 domain inhibited its ability to contribute to the formation of invasome structures. Next, we show that BepF function during invasome formation can be replaced by the over-expression of constitutive-active Rho GTPases Rac1 or Cdc42. Finally we demonstrate that BID-F1 and BID-F2 domains promote the formation of filopodia-like extensions in NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells as well as membrane protrusions in HeLa cells, suggesting a role for BepF in Rac1 and Cdc42 activation during the process of invasome formation."
https://openalex.org/W1987499059,"Diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) are the main components of ambient particulate materials, including polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), n-PAHs, heavy metals, and gaseous materials. Many epidemiological, clinical, and toxicological studies have shown that ambient particles, including DEPs, are associated with respiratory disorders, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and lung cancer. However, the relationship between the biological response to DEPs and their chemical composition remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the physicochemical properties of DEPs before toxicological studies, and then administered a single intratracheal instillation of DEPs to mice. The mice were then killed 1, 7, 14 and 28 days after DEP exposure to observe the biological responses induced by DEPs over time. Our findings suggest that DEPs engulfed into cells induced a Th2-type inflammatory response followed by DNA damage, whereas DEPs not engulfed into cells induced a Th1-type inflammatory response. Further, the physicochemical properties, including surface charge, particle size, and chemical composition, of DEPs play a crucial role in determining the biological responses to DEPs. Consequently, we suggest that the biological response to DEPs depend on cell-particle interaction and the physicochemical properties of the particles."
https://openalex.org/W2014177987,"Background Human hair is one of the essential components that define appearance and is a useful source of samples for non-invasive biomonitoring. We describe a novel application of imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) of hair biomolecules for advanced molecular characterization and a better understanding of hair aging. As a cosmetic and biomedical application, molecules whose levels in hair altered with aging were comprehensively investigated. Methods Human hair was collected from 15 young (20±5 years old) and 15 older (50±5 years old) volunteers. Matrix-free laser desorption/ionization IMS was used to visualize molecular distribution in the hair sections. Hair-specific ions displaying a significant difference in the intensities between the 2 age groups were extracted as candidate markers for aging. Tissue localization of the molecules and alterations in their levels in the cortex and medulla in the young and old groups were determined. Results Among the 31 molecules detected specifically in hair sections, 2—one at m/z 153.00, tentatively assigned to be dihydrouracil, and the other at m/z 207.04, identified to be 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid (DHMA)—exhibited a higher signal intensity in the young group than in the old, and 1 molecule at m/z 164.00, presumed to be O-phosphoethanolamine, displayed a higher intensity in the old group. Among the 3, putative O-phosphoethanolamine showed a cortex-specific distribution. The 3 molecules in cortex presented the same pattern of alteration in signal intensity with aging, whereas those in medulla did not exhibit significant alteration. Conclusion Three molecules whose levels in hair altered with age were extracted. While they are all possible markers for aging, putative dihydrouracil and DHMA, are also suspected to play a role in maintaining hair properties and could be targets for cosmetic supplementation. Mapping of ion localization in hair by IMS is a powerful method to extract biomolecules in specified regions and determine their tissue distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2022791883,"Control strategies enforced by health agencies are a major type of practice to contain influenza outbreaks. Another type of practice is the voluntary preventive behavior of individuals, such as receiving vaccination, taking antiviral drugs, and wearing face masks. These two types of practices take effects concurrently in influenza containment, but little attention has been paid to their combined effectiveness. This article estimates this combined effectiveness using established simulation models in the urbanized area of Buffalo, NY, USA. Three control strategies are investigated, including: Targeted Antiviral Prophylaxis (TAP), workplace/school closure, community travel restriction, as well as the combination of the three. All control strategies are simulated with and without regard to individual preventive behavior, and the resulting effectiveness are compared. The simulation outcomes suggest that weaker control strategies could suffice to contain influenza epidemics, because individuals voluntarily adopt preventive behavior, rendering these weaker strategies more effective than would otherwise have been expected. The preventive behavior of individuals could save medical resources for control strategies and avoid unnecessary socio-economic interruptions. This research adds a human behavioral dimension into the simulation of control strategies and offers new insights into disease containment. Health policy makers are recommended to review current control strategies and comprehend preventive behavior patterns of local populations before making decisions on influenza containment."
https://openalex.org/W2124886350,"Cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) function is modulated by Ca(2+) and Mg(2+). To better characterize Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) binding sites involved in RyR2 regulation, the effects of cytosolic and luminal earth alkaline divalent cations (M(2+): Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Sr(2+), Ba(2+)) were studied on RyR2 from pig ventricle reconstituted in bilayers. RyR2 were activated by M(2+) binding to high affinity activating sites at the cytosolic channel surface, specific for Ca(2+) or Sr(2+). This activation was interfered by Mg(2+) and Ba(2+) acting at low affinity M(2+)-unspecific binding sites. When testing the effects of luminal M(2+) as current carriers, all M(2+) increased maximal RyR2 open probability (compared to Cs(+)), suggesting the existence of low affinity activating M(2+)-unspecific sites at the luminal surface. Responses to M(2+) vary from channel to channel (heterogeneity). However, with luminal Ba(2+)or Mg(2+), RyR2 were less sensitive to cytosolic Ca(2+) and caffeine-mediated activation, openings were shorter and voltage-dependence was more marked (compared to RyR2 with luminal Ca(2+)or Sr(2+)). Kinetics of RyR2 with mixtures of luminal Ba(2+)/Ca(2+) and additive action of luminal plus cytosolic Ba(2+) or Mg(2+) suggest luminal M(2+) differentially act on luminal sites rather than accessing cytosolic sites through the pore. This suggests the presence of additional luminal activating Ca(2+)/Sr(2+)-specific sites, which stabilize high P(o) mode (less voltage-dependent) and increase RyR2 sensitivity to cytosolic Ca(2+) activation. In summary, RyR2 luminal and cytosolic surfaces have at least two sets of M(2+) binding sites (specific for Ca(2+) and unspecific for Ca(2+)/Mg(2+)) that dynamically modulate channel activity and gating status, depending on SR voltage."
https://openalex.org/W2051749818,"Background Enoyl-ACP reductase (ENR) catalyses the last reduction reaction in the fatty acid elongation cycle in bacteria and is a good antimicrobial target candidate. FabV is the most recently discovered class of ENR, but we lack information about the atomic structure and the key residues involved in reductase activity except for the known conserved tyrosine and lysine residues in the Y-X8-K active site motif. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report the crystal structure of FabV from Xanthomonas oryzae (xoFabV). The crystal structure of this enzyme has been solved to 1.6 Å resolution in space group P212121. The model of xoFabV consists of one monomer in the asymmetric unit which is composed of 13 α-helices and 11 β-strands, representing a canonical Rossmann fold architecture. Structural comparison presents that the locations of the conserved tyrosine (Y236) and lysine (K245) residues in the Y-X8-K active site motif of xoFabV and the Y-X6-K motif of ecFabI are notably similar. However, the conformations of Y236 in xoFabV and Y156 in ecFabI are distinct. Structure-based site-directed mutagenesis and enzymatic activity assays reveal that in addition to the conserved Y236 and K245 in the Y-X8-K motif, Y53, D111 and Y226 are key residues implicated in the reductase activity, and F113 and T276 are also important for enzyme function. Moreover, a proposed active lysine located immediately after the Y-X8-K motif in FabV from Burkholderia mallei (bmFabV) is altered to an inactive V246 in xoFabV. Conclusions/Significance We determine the first crystal structure of the FabV enzyme and identify several residues important for its enzymatic activity. These findings lay a solid foundation for the development of specific antibacterial inhibitors of the pathogenic bacteria, such as Vibrio cholerae, Burkholderia species and Xanthomonas species."
https://openalex.org/W2063054683,"Diet-induced obesity in rat pregnancy has been shown previously to be associated with consistently raised blood pressure in the offspring, attributed to sympathetic over-activation, but the relative contributions to this phenotype of maternal obesity versus raised dietary fat is unknown. Sprague-Dawley female rats were fed either a control (4.3% fat, n = 11) or lard-enriched (23.6% fat, n = 16) chow 10 days prior to mating, throughout pregnancy and lactation. In conscious adult (9-month-old) offspring cardiovascular parameters were measured (radiotelemetry). The short period of fat-feeding did not increase maternal weight versus controls and the baseline blood pressure was similar in offspring of fat fed dams (OF) and controls (OC). However, adult male OF showed heightened cardiovascular reactivity to acute restraint stress (p<0.01; Δ systolic blood pressure (SBP) and Δheart rate (HR)) with a prolonged recovery time compared to male OC. α1/β-adrenergic receptor blockade normalised the response. Also, after dietary salt-loading (8%-NaCl ad libitum for 1 week) male OF demonstrated higher SBP (p<0.05) in the awake phase (night-time) and increased low/high frequency ratio of power spectral density of HR variability versus OC. Baroreflex gain and basal power spectral density components of the heart rate or blood pressure were similar in male OF and OC. Minor abnormalities were evident in female OF. Fat feeding in the absence of maternal obesity in pregnant rats leads to altered sympathetic control of cardiovascular function in adult male offspring, and hypertension in response to stressor stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2122949570,"Plasma activity of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) increases in patients with cardiovascular disease. The present study investigated whether platelet-released sPLA2 induces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) modifications that translate into changes in lipoprotein function. Activated but not resting platelets induced oxidative modifications of human native LDLs and HDLs, which render these particles dysfunctional. Platelet-incubated LDLs stimulated the incorporation of cholesterol oleate into macrophages, and modified HDLs lost their cholesterol efflux capacity and antioxidant properties. In vitro and ex vivo experiments showed that lysophophatidylcholine accumulated in the platelet-modified LDLs and HDLs of mice expressing sPLA2 (Balb/c and transgenic C57Bl/6 mice expressing human sPLA2) but not in the lipoproteins of naturally sPLA2-deficient mice (C57Bl/6). Unlike C57Bl/6 mice, Balb/c mice injected with leptin (67 μg/mouse, i.p.) as an in vivo prothrombotic agent displayed increased plasma sPLA2 activity, reduced clotting time, higher plasma levels of oxidation products, increased production of nonesterified fatty acids, and more substantial platelet-mediated modification of lipoproteins. These effects were blocked completely by injection of the platelet inhibitor ticlopidine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or by a sPLA2 inhibitor (LY311727, 3 mg/kg, i.p.). These results demonstrate that stimulated platelets are major contributors to plasma sPLA2 activity in vivo and account to a large extent for the adverse modification of circulating lipoproteins.—Blache, D., Gautier, T., Tietge, U.

https://openalex.org/W2109999333,"The cultivation of genetically modified (GM) plants has raised several environmental concerns. One of these concerns regards non-target soil fauna organisms, which play an important role in the decomposition of organic matter and hence are largely exposed to GM plant residues. Soil fauna may be directly affected by transgene products or indirectly by pleiotropic effects such as a modified plant metabolism. Thus, ecosystem services and functioning might be affected negatively. In a litterbag experiment in the field we analysed the decomposition process and the soil fauna community involved. Therefore, we used four experimental GM wheat varieties, two with a race-specific antifungal resistance against powdery mildew (Pm3b) and two with an unspecific antifungal resistance based on the expression of chitinase and glucanase. We compared them with two non-GM isolines and six conventional cereal varieties. To elucidate the mechanisms that cause differences in plant decomposition, structural plant components (i.e. C∶N ratio, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose) were examined and soil properties, temperature and precipitation were monitored. The most frequent taxa extracted from decaying plant material were mites (Cryptostigmata, Gamasina and Uropodina), springtails (Isotomidae), annelids (Enchytraeidae) and Diptera (Cecidomyiidae larvae). Despite a single significant transgenic/month interaction for Cecidomyiidae larvae, which is probably random, we detected no impact of the GM wheat on the soil fauna community. However, soil fauna differences among conventional cereal varieties were more pronounced than between GM and non-GM wheat. While leaf residue decomposition in GM and non-GM wheat was similar, differences among conventional cereals were evident. Furthermore, sampling date and location were found to greatly influence soil fauna community and decomposition processes. The results give no indication of ecologically relevant adverse effects of antifungal GM wheat on the composition and the activity of the soil fauna community."
https://openalex.org/W2120446028,"Background Circulating CD34+ cells, a population that includes endothelial progenitors, participate in the maintenance of endothelial integrity. Better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate their survival is crucial to improve their regenerative activity in cardiovascular and renal diseases. Chemokine-receptor cross talk is critical in regulating cell homeostasis. We hypothesized that cell surface expression of the chemokine fractalkine (FKN) could target progenitor cell injury by Natural Killer (NK) cells, thereby limiting their availability for vascular repair. Methodology/Principal Findings We show that CD34+-derived Endothelial Colony Forming Cells (ECFC) can express FKN in response to TNF-α and IFN-γ inflammatory cytokines and that FKN expression by ECFC stimulates NK cell adhesion, NK cell-mediated ECFC lysis and microparticles release in vitro. The specific involvement of membrane FKN in these processes was demonstrated using FKN-transfected ECFC and anti-FKN blocking antibody. FKN expression was also evidenced on circulating CD34+ progenitor cells and was detected at higher frequency in kidney transplant recipients, when compared to healthy controls. The proportion of CD34+ cells expressing FKN was identified as an independent variable inversely correlated to CD34+ progenitor cell count. We further showed that treatment of CD34+ circulating cells isolated from adult blood donors with transplant serum or TNF-α/IFN-γ can induce FKN expression. Conclusions Our data highlights a novel mechanism by which FKN expression on CD34+ progenitor cells may target their NK cell mediated killing and participate to their immune depletion in transplant recipients. Considering the numerous diseased contexts shown to promote FKN expression, our data identify FKN as a hallmark of altered progenitor cell homeostasis with potential implications in better evaluation of vascular repair in patients."
https://openalex.org/W1966345205,"Many viruses within the Flavivirus genus cause significant disease in humans; however, effective antivirals against these viruses are not currently available. We have previously shown that a thiopurine drug, 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside (6MMPr), inhibits replication of distantly related viruses within the Flaviviridae family in cell culture, including bovine viral diarrhea virus and hepatitis C virus replicon. Here we further examined the potential antiviral effect of 6MMPr on several diverse flaviviruses. In cell culture, 6MMPr inhibited virus production of yellow fever virus, dengue virus-2 (DENV-2) and West Nile virus (WNV) in a dose-dependent manner, and DENV-2 was significantly more sensitive to 6MMPr treatment than WNV. We then explored the use of 6MMPr as an antiviral against WNV in an immunocompetent mouse model. Once a day treatment of mice with 0.5 mg 6MMPr was just below the toxic dose in our mouse model, and this dose was used in subsequent studies. Mice were treated with 6MMPr immediately after subcutaneous inoculation with WNV for eight consecutive days. Treatment with 6MMPr exacerbated weight loss in WNV-inoculated mice and did not significantly affect mortality. We hypothesized that 6MMPr has low bioavailability in the central nervous system (CNS) and examined the effect of pre-treatment with 6MMPr on viral loads in the periphery and CNS. Pre-treatment with 6MMPr had no significant effect on viremia or viral titers in the periphery, but resulted in significantly higher viral loads in the brain, suggesting that the effect of 6MMPr is tissue-dependent. In conclusion, despite being a potent inhibitor of flaviviruses in cell culture, 6MMPr was not effective against West Nile disease in mice; however, further studies are warranted to reduce the toxicity and/or improve the bioavailability of this potential antiviral drug."
https://openalex.org/W2080136005,"Leptospira interrogans is a bacterium that is capable of infecting animals and humans, and its infection causes leptospirosis with a range of symptoms from flu-like to severe illness and death. Despite being a bacteria, Leptospira interrogans contains a plastidic class ferredoxin-NADP(H) reductase (FNR) with high catalytic efficiency, at difference from the bacterial class FNRs. These flavoenzymes catalyze the electron transfer between NADP(H) and ferredoxins or flavodoxins. The inclusion of a plastidic FNR in Leptospira metabolism and in its parasitic life cycle is not currently understood. Bioinformatic analyses of the available genomic and proteins sequences showed that the presence of this enzyme in nonphotosynthetic bacteria is restricted to the Leptospira genus and that a [4Fe-4S] ferredoxin (LB107) encoded by the Leptospira genome may be the natural substrate of the enzyme. Leptospira FNR (LepFNR) displayed high diaphorase activity using artificial acceptors and functioned as a ferric reductase. LepFNR displayed cytochrome c reductase activity with the Leptospira LB107 ferredoxin with an optimum at pH 6.5. Structural stability analysis demonstrates that LepFNR is one of the most stable FNRs analyzed to date. The persistence of a native folded LepFNR structure was detected in up to 6 M urea, a condition in which the enzyme retains 38% activity. In silico analysis indicates that the high LepFNR stability might be due to robust interactions between the FAD and the NADP+ domains of the protein. The limited bacterial distribution of plastidic class FNRs and the biochemical and structural properties of LepFNR emphasize the uniqueness of this enzyme in the Leptospira metabolism. Our studies show that in L. interrogans a plastidic-type FNR exchanges electrons with a bacterial-type ferredoxin, process which has not been previously observed in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2029967606,"While chronic infection has been shown to enhance protection from disease caused by several pathogens, the mechanisms are not known. The gamma-c family of cytokines IL-7, IL-2, and IL-15 are implicated in homeostatic proliferation, which is thought to maintain T cell memory. However in chronic infection, prolonged antigen exposure itself may contribute to lymphocyte survival. We have previously observed that chronic malaria infection enhances protection to re-infection, as well as enhancing B cell responses. Here, we show that chronic Plasmodium chabaudi malaria infection in mice enhances the expansion of CD4+ T cells in a second infection, and that this correlates with increased expression of the IL-2/15 Receptor beta (CD122) on memory T cells, as well as increasing IL-2 producers on re-infection. IL-2 has been recently linked to improved secondary proliferation, while the role of IL-7 in maintenance of CD4+ memory cells has been demonstrated in homeostatic proliferation, but its role in protective memory populations in infectious disease protective has not been fully investigated. Increased IL-7Rα (CD127) expression correlated, as previously reported with increased turnover of CD4 memory cells, however, this was not linked to protection or enhanced response to rechallenge, These data support the idea that antigen or IL-2 production resulting from chronic stimulation may play a role in an enhanced secondary T cell response."
https://openalex.org/W2038761728,"Pathophysiological remodeling processes at an early stage of an acquired epilepsy are critical but not well understood. Therefore, we examined acute changes in action potential (AP) dynamics immediately following status epilepticus (SE) in mice. SE was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of kainate, and behavioral manifestation of SE was monitored for 3–4 h. After this time interval CA1 pyramidal cells were studied ex vivo with whole-cell current-clamp and Ca2+ imaging techniques in a hippocampal slice preparation. Following acute SE both resting potential and firing threshold were modestly depolarized (2–5 mV). No changes were seen in input resistance or membrane time constant, but AP latency was prolonged and AP upstroke velocity reduced following acute SE. All cells showed an increase in AP halfwidth and regular (rather than burst) firing, and in a fraction of cells the notch, typically preceding spike afterdepolarization (ADP), was absent following acute SE. Notably, the typical attenuation of backpropagating action potential (b-AP)-induced Ca2+ signals along the apical dendrite was strengthened following acute SE. The effects of acute SE on the retrograde spread of excitation were mimicked by applying the Kv4 current potentiating drug NS5806. Our data unveil a reduced somatodendritic excitability in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells immediately after acute SE with a possible involvement of both Na+ and K+ current components."
https://openalex.org/W2070102792,"Social networks rely on basic rules of conduct to yield functioning societies in both human and animal populations. As individuals follow established rules, their behavioral decisions shape the social network and give it structure. Using dynamic, self-organizing social network models we demonstrate that defying conventions in a social system can affect multiple levels of social and organizational success independently. Such actions primarily affect actors' own positions within the network, but individuals can also affect the overall structure of a network even without immediately affecting themselves or others. These results indicate that defying the established social norms can help individuals to change the properties of a social system via seemingly neutral behaviors, highlighting the power of rule-breaking behavior to transform convention-based societies, even before direct impacts on individuals can be measured."
https://openalex.org/W2071060203,"In somatic cells, three major pathways are involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DBS): Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), Single-Strand Annealing (SSA) and Homologous Recombination (HR). In somatic and meiotic HR, DNA DSB are 5′ to 3′ resected, producing long 3′ single-stranded DNA extensions. Brca2 is essential to load the Rad51 recombinase onto these 3′ overhangs. The resulting nucleofilament can thus invade a homologous DNA sequence to copy and restore the original genetic information. In Arabidopsis, the inactivation of Brca2 specifically during meiosis by an RNAi approach results in aberrant chromosome aggregates, chromosomal fragmentation and missegregation leading to a sterility phenotype. We had previously suggested that such chromosomal behaviour could be due to NHEJ. In this study, we show that knock-out plants affected in both BRCA2 genes show the same meiotic phenotype as the RNAi-inactivated plants. Moreover, it is demonstrated that during meiosis, neither NHEJ nor SSA compensate for HR deficiency in BRCA2-inactivated plants. The role of the plant-specific DNA Ligase6 is also excluded. The possible mechanism(s) involved in the formation of these aberrant chromosomal bridges in the absence of HR during meiosis are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1970552203,"During mental actions subjects feel themselves performing a movement without any corresponding motor output. Although broad information is available regarding the influence of central lesions on action representation, little is known about how peripheral damages affect mental events. In the current study, we investigated whether lack of vestibular information influences action representation. Twelve healthy adults and twelve patients with bilateral vestibular damage actually performed and mentally simulated walking and drawing. The locomotor paths implied one (first walking task) and four (second walking task) changes in the walking direction. In the drawing task, participants drew on a sheet of paper a path that was similar to that of the second walking task. We recorded and compared between the two groups the timing of actual and mental movements. We found significant temporal discrepancies between actual and mental walking movements in the group of patients. Conversely, drawing actual and drawing mental durations were similar. For the control group, an isochrony between mental and actual movements was observed for the three tasks. This result denotes an inconsistency between action representation and action execution following vestibular damage, which is specific to walking movements, and emphasizes the role of the vestibular system upon mental states of actions. This observation may have important clinical implications. During action planning vestibular patients may overestimate the capacity of their motor system (imaging faster, executing slower) with harmful consequences for their health."

We have generated five dual-specific single chain variable fragments (scFv) that neutralize the activity of the two chemokines, CXCL9 and CXCL10, to bind to their receptor CXCR3. To better understand how these dual-specific scFvs bind these two chemokines that only share a 37% sequence identity, we mapped their epitopes on human CXCL9 and CXCL10 and identified serine 13 (Ser(13)) as a critical residue. It is conserved between the two chemokines but not in the third ligand for CXCR3, CXCL11. Furthermore, Ser(13) is exposed in the tetrameric structure of CXCL10, which is consistent with our finding that the scFvs are able to bind to CXCL9 and CXCL10 immobilized on glycosaminoglycans. Overall, the data indicate that these dual-specific scFvs bind to a conserved surface involved in CXCR3 receptor interaction for CXCL10 and CXCL9. Thus, structural mimicry between the two targets is likely to be responsible for the observed dual specificity of these antibody fragments."
