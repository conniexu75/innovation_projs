https://openalex.org/W2080151027,"Observations of Raman spectra of various molecules at different exciting laser wavelengths lead to an empirical rule. If a Raman line becomes stronger when the exciting frequency is brought closer to the frequency of an electronic band, this means that the equilibrium conformation of the molecule is distorted along the normal coordinate for the Raman line in the transition from the ground to the excited electronic state."

https://openalex.org/W1999992927,"Measurements of transpiration, cell division, and cell enlargement show that no single lower limit of available water can be defined for these three plant processes. The soil-water content at which permanent wilting is exhibited does not represent a true lower limit for any of these."
https://openalex.org/W1974091131,"The MÃ¶ssbauer effect has been observed for Fe(57) atoms at the surface of eta Al(2)O(3). The Fe(57) is trivalent, and the quadrupole splitting found is consistent with a surface location. Anisotropy of thermal vibration relative to the surface is observed."
https://openalex.org/W2002336948,Diamonds in two of the three diamantiferous stony meteorites (ureilites) show a pronounced crystallographic orientation. This suggests that the diamonds were produced by shock during breakup of the meteorite's parent body rather than by high gravitational pressure.

https://openalex.org/W1989727864,"The cell membrane resistance to direct current was measured in single cells for the first time in a higher plant tissue, oat coleoptiles (Avena sativa). On the assumption that the current density over the cell surface was uniform, a mean value of about 1300 ohm-cm2 was found for cells in an external nutrient medium containing 1 mmole each of K+, Na+, and Ca++ per liter. As expected, either decreasing K+ concentration or increasing Ca++ concentration increased the resistance."

https://openalex.org/W1987434442,"The probability that two stratigraphic events are in a particular order in a section in which they occur in sequence is p. Because of finite sampling, statistical techniques are used to calculate the parameters p' and p(l), which express the uncertainty of our knowledge of p; p' is the measured value of the maximum likelihood estimator of p and p(l) is the lower end point of the confidence interval on which p must lie. The most reliable sequence for stratigraphic correlation is obtained by maximizing the parameter p' (1-p(l)) between pairs of events."
https://openalex.org/W2003601345,"Two female inbred cucumbers were developed by substituting gene Acr for acr in the genetic backgrounds of the monoecious races Marketer and Tokyo, which exhibit weak and strong male tendency respectively. Marketer females are resistant and Tokyo females are sensitive to sex reversion in response to treatments with gibberellin A3. Resistance and sensitivity of this type appear to depend upon the genetic system which controls sex tendency."

https://openalex.org/W1966805891,"The reaction product of Xe, F(2), and SiF(4) in a glow discharge has been shown to have a composition approximating Xe(2)SiF(6). It and a similar hexafluorophosphate are unstable at room temperature. A stable hexafluoro-antimonate is formed from Xe, F(2), and SbF(5) at 250 degrees C."

https://openalex.org/W2064824311,"A report by Cicerone et al. (1974) concerned with the potential size of the atmospheric perturbation produced by man-made chlorofluoromethanes is considered, giving attention to a number of errors made in the first investigation and their correction. However, the corrections do not significantly change the results reported. It had been found that chlorine oxides which arise from chlorofluoromethane usage will within 10 or 15 years provide a sink for stratospheric ozone which will dominate the natural sinks for ozone."
