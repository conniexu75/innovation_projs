https://openalex.org/W2053200644,"We have employed a method based on the Cre-loxP recombination system of bacteriophage P1 to generate a mouse strain in which the JH segments and the intron enhancer in the IgH locus are deleted. By analysis of immunoglobulin isotype switch recombination in heterozygous mutant B cells activated by lipopolysaccharide plus interleukin-4, we show that, on the mutant chromosome, switch recombination at the mu gene switch region is strongly suppressed, whereas the switch region of the gamma 1 gene is efficiently rearranged. These data demonstrate an independent control of switch recombination at individual switch regions and suggest that, in the process of switch recombination, the alignment of the recombining strands occurs independently of and probably after the introduction of double-strand breaks into the switch regions involved."

https://openalex.org/W2062639699,"Retroviral Gag protein is capable of directing the assembly of virion particles independent of other retroviral elements and plays an important role early in the infection of a cell. Using the GAL4 two hybrid system, we screened a cDNA expression library and identified two host proteins, cyclophillins (CyPs) A and B, which interact specifically with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag polyprotein Pr55gag. Glutathione S-transferase-CyP fusion proteins bind tightly to Pr55gag in vitro, as well as to the HIV-1 capsid protein p24. Cyclosporin A efficiently disrupts the Gag-CyPA interaction and less efficiently disrupts the Gag-CyPB interaction. The Gag-CyP interaction may be important for the HIV-1 life cycle and may be relevant to the pathology caused by this immunosuppressive virus."
https://openalex.org/W1971908211,"The biological functions of interleukin-6 (IL-6) are mediated through a signal-transducing component of the IL-6 receptor, gp130, which is associated with the ligand-occupied IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) protein. Binding of IL-6 to IL-6R induced disulfide-linked homodimerization of gp130. Tyrosine kinase activity was associated with dimerized but not monomeric gp130 protein. Substitution of serine for proline residues 656 and 658 in the cytoplasmic motif abolished tyrosine kinase activation and cellular responses but not homodimerization of gp130. The IL-6-induced gp130 homodimer appears to be similar in function to the heterodimer formed between the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor (LIFR) and gp130 in response to the LIF or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). Thus, a general first step in IL-6-related cytokine signaling may be the dimerization of signal-transducing molecules and activation of associated tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1973732415,"Mammalian apolipoprotein B (apo B) exists in two forms, each the product of a single gene. The shorter form, apo B48, arises by posttranscriptional RNA editing whereby cytidine deamination produces a UAA termination codon. A full-length complementary DNA clone encoding an apo B messenger RNA editing protein (REPR) was isolated from rat small intestine. The 229-residue protein contains consensus phosphorylation sites and leucine zipper domains. HepG2 cell extracts acquire editing activity when mixed with REPR from oocyte extracts. REPR is essential for apo B messenger RNA editing, and the isolation and characterization of REPR may lead to the identification of other eukaryotic RNA editing proteins."

Anatomical changes in the nerve terminals that provide input to the visual cortex have previously been observed only after weeks of deprivation, suggesting that synapses become physiologically ineffective before the branches on which they sit are withdrawn. Reconstruction of single geniculocortical axonal arbors in the cat after either brief or prolonged monocular occlusion revealed striking axonal rearrangements in both instances. Rapid withdrawal of the branches of deprived-eye arbors suggests that axonal branches bearing synapses respond quickly to changing patterns of neuronal activity."
https://openalex.org/W1982410689,"It is generally accepted that DNA appeared after RNA during the chemical evolution of life. To synthesize DNA, deoxyribonucleotides are required as building blocks. At present, these are formed from the corresponding ribonucleotides through the enzymatic action of ribonucleotide reductases. Three classes of enzymes are present in various organisms. There is little sequence similarity among the three classes of reductases. However, enzymic mechanisms and the allosteric behavior of the enzymes from various organisms are strongly conserved, suggesting that the enzymes might have evolved from a common ancestor, with the class III anaerobic Escherichia coli reductase as its closest relative."

https://openalex.org/W2019357185,"In each abdominal hemisegment of the Drosophila embryo, an array of 30 muscle fibers is innervated by about 34 motoneurons in a highly stereotyped and cell-specific fashion. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis of neural specificity in this system, we conducted a genetic screen for mutations affecting neuromuscular connectivity. We focus on 5 genes required for specific aspects of pathway (beaten path, stranded, and short stop) and target (walkabout and clueless) recognition. The different classes of mutant phenotypes suggest that neural specificity is controlled by a hierarchy of molecular mechanisms: motoneurons are guided toward the correct region of mesoderm, in many cases navigating a series of choice points along the way; they then display an affinity for a particular domain of neighboring muscles; and finally, they recognize their specific muscle target from within this domain."
https://openalex.org/W2064812124,"Csk is a novel cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase that has been shown to inactivate members of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases in vitro. To examine the function of Csk in vivo, Csk-deficient mouse embryos were generated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. These embryos were developmentally arrested at the 10 to 12 somite stage and exhibited growth retardation and necrosis in the neural tissues. The kinase activity of p60c-src, p59fyn, and p53/56lyn in these embryos was greatly enhanced as an apparent consequence of enhanced specific activity. The increase in kinase activity was associated with an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, especially those around 85 and 120 kd. Thus, these results suggest that Csk indeed acts as an indispensable negative regulator of Src family kinases in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2090896399,"CD8+ T cells are a major defense against viral infections and intracellular parasites. Their production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and their cytolytic activity are key elements in the immune response to these pathogens. Mature mouse CD8+ T cells that were activated in the presence of interleukin-4 (IL-4) developed into a CD8-CD4- population that was not cytolytic and did not produce IFN-gamma. However, these CD8- cells produced large amounts of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 and helped activate resting B cells. Thus, CD8 effector functions are potentially diverse and could be exploited by infectious agents that switch off host protective cytolytic responses."
https://openalex.org/W1999838506,"The signal sequence is in an aqueous milieu at an early stage in the translocation of a nascent secretory protein across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This was determined using fluorescent probes incorporated into the signal sequence of fully assembled ribosome-nascent chain-membrane complexes: the fluorescence lifetimes revealed that the probes were in an aqueous environment rather than buried in the nonpolar core of the membrane. Since these membrane-bound probes were not susceptible to collisional quenching by iodide ions, the space containing the signal sequence is sealed off from the cytoplasm by a tight ribosome-membrane junction. The nascent chain inside the ribosome is also not exposed to the cytoplasm and apparently passes through an aqueous tunnel in the ribosome."

https://openalex.org/W2082738033,"The S. cerevisiae SIS1 gene is essential and encodes a heat shock protein with similarity to the bacterial DnaJ protein. At the nonpermissive temperature, temperature-sensitive sis1 strains rapidly accumulate 80S ribosomes and have decreased amounts of polysomes. Certain alterations in 60S ribosomal subunits can suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of sis1 strains and prevent the accumulation of 80S ribosomes and the loss of polysomes normally seen under conditions of reduced SIS1 function. Analysis of sucrose gradients for SIS1 protein shows that a large fraction of SIS1 is associated with 40S ribosomal subunits and the smaller polysomes. These and other results indicate that SIS1 is required for the normal initiation of translation. Because DnaJ has been shown to mediate the dissociation of several protein complexes, the requirement of SIS1 in the initiation of translation might be for mediating the dissociation of a specific protein complex of the translation machinery."

https://openalex.org/W2037471749,"During the SOS response, LexA repressor is inactivated by specific cleavage. Although cleavage requires RecA protein in vivo, RecA acts indirectly as a coprotease by stimulating an inherent self-cleavage activity of LexA. In lambda lysogens, cleavage of lambda Cl repressor in a similar but far slower reaction results in prophage induction. We describe an intermolecular cleavage reaction in which the C-terminal fragment of LexA acted as an enzyme to cleave other molecules of LexA. The C-terminal fragment of lambda repressor cleaved the LexA substrates about as efficiently as did the LexA enzyme, suggesting that the slow rate of Cl self-cleavage results from a weak interaction between its cleavage site and the active site."
