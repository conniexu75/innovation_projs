https://openalex.org/W2053559739,"Multiple types of calcium channels have been found in neurons, but uncertainty remains about which ones are involved in stimulus-secretion coupling. Two types of calcium channels in rat sympathetic neurons were described, and their relative importance in controlling norepinephrine release was analyzed. N-type and L-type calcium channels differed in voltage dependence, unitary barium conductance, and pharmacology. Nitrendipine inhibited activity of L-type channels but not N-type channels. Potassium-evoked norepinephrine release was markedly reduced by cadmium and the conesnail peptide toxin omega-Conus geographus toxin VIA, agents that block both N- and L-type channels, but was little affected by nitrendipine at concentrations that strongly reduce calcium influx, as measured by fura-2. Thus N-type calcium channels play a dominant role in the depolarization-evoked release of norepinephrine."
https://openalex.org/W2036260827,"Adjuvant arthritis (AA) is a chronic disease inducible in rats by immunization with an antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis1. After the isolation of arthritogenic T-cell lines2 and clones3, it became possible to demonstrate that the critical M. tuberculosis antigen contained an epitope cross-reactive with a self-antigen in joint cartilage4–6. Like AA rats, patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis demonstrated specific T-lymphocyte reactivity to the M. tuberculosis fraction containing the cross-reactive epitope7. To characterize the critical M. tuberculosis epitope we used AA T-cell clones to screen mycobacterial antigens expressed in Escherichia coli and genetically engineered truncated proteins and synthetic peptides. The AA T-cell clones recognized an epitope formed by the amino acids at positions 180–188 in the sequence of a Mycobacterium bovis BCG antigen8. Administration of this antigen to rats induced resistance to subsequent attempts to produce AA."
https://openalex.org/W1577857859,"M21 human melanoma cells express an Arg-Gly-Asp-directed adhesion receptor composed of noncovalently associated alpha and beta chains. To establish the structural and functional properties of this receptor on M21 human melanoma cells, stable variant cell lines were selected that express altered alpha chain levels. One of these variants, M21-L, fails to synthesize alpha chain protein or its mRNA, yet does produce normal levels of the beta chain. In these cells the beta chain does not reach the cell surface but rather accumulates within the cell. M21-L cells lacking the alpha chain are incapable of attaching to vitronectin, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, or an Arg-Gly-Asp-containing heptapeptide yet attach normally to fibronectin, whereas the unselected M21 cells attach to all of these adhesive proteins. In addition, a monoclonal antibody, LM609 generated to a functional site on the intact receptor, is capable of preventing M21 cell attachment to vitronectin, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, and the Arg-Gly-Asp peptide but not to fibronectin. Following a 2-min biosynthetic pulse-label, the newly synthesized alpha chain remains in free form for 5 min and then associates with previously synthesized beta chain present in an intracellular pool. Once oligomerization takes place, the receptor gains the capacity to recognize Arg-Gly-Asp, and at this time the epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody LM609 is formed."

https://openalex.org/W2095447862,"In a study of the mechanism of resistance to autoimmune disease induced by T cell vaccination, rats were vaccinated against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by injecting them once in the hind footpads with a subencephalitogenic dose (10(4)) of a clone of T lymphocytes specific for myelin basic protein (BP). The response to vaccination was assayed by challenging the rats with an encephalitogenic dose (3 X 10(6)) of T lymphocytes of this BP-specific clone. Five to six days after vaccination, the cells responsible for mediating resistance to adoptively transferred EAE were concentrated in the popliteal lymph nodes draining the vaccination site. Transfer of the draining lymph node cells to unvaccinated rats led to loss of resistance in the donor rats and acquisition of resistance by the recipient rats. Limiting-dilution cultures of the draining lymph node cells were established with irradiated cells of the BP-specific clone as stimulators. Two sets of T lymphocytes specifically responsive to the BP-specific T cells from the clone were isolated: CD4+CD8- helper and CD4-CD8+ suppressor cells. The helper T cells, like the BP antigen, specifically stimulated the BP-specific vaccinating clone. In contrast, the suppressor T cells specifically suppressed the response of the BP-specific vaccinating clone to its BP antigen. These results suggest that T cell vaccination induces resistance to autoimmune disease by activating an antiidiotypic network."

https://openalex.org/W1483159812,"We assessed the ability of acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) to stimulate tyrosine kinase activity in intact cells. Immunoblot with polyclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibodies detected a 90-kDa phosphotyrosine-bearing protein in lysates of Swiss 3T3 cells exposed to pituitary-derived FGF, recombinant acidic FGF, or recombinant basic FGF, but not from unstimulated cells or cells exposed to epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor. Phosphotyrosine and its analogue phenyl phosphate, but not phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or tyrosine itself, blocked recognition of the 90-kDa protein by antiphosphotyrosine antiserum. A monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody also recognized the 90-kDa protein and was used to partially purify the protein by immunoaffinity chromatography. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the 90 kDa band revealed that it contained 20% phosphotyrosine, 35% phosphothreonine, and 45% phosphoserine. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 90-kDa protein was detectable within 30 s and reached a plateau within 10 min of FGF addition. The addition of suramin, which blocks the interaction of FGF with its receptor, caused rapid disappearance of the 90 kDa band. Cell fractionation experiments were consistent with the 90-kDa protein being membrane-associated, but cross-linking studies revealed that the FGF receptor had an Mr between 145 and 210 kDa in Swiss 3T3 cells, distinct from the 90-kDa major substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation. These data demonstrate that both acidic and basic FGF activate a tyrosine kinase in vivo leading to phosphorylation of a unique 90-kDa substrate, and they suggest that protein modification by phosphorylation at tyrosine is involved in eliciting the mitogenic effect of FGF."
https://openalex.org/W2026430354,"In this paper we demonstrate a role for mRNA stability in controlling relative gene expression within a polycistronic operon. The polycistronic malEFG operon of E. coli contains two REP sequences (highly conserved inverted repeats) within the malE-malF intercistronic region. Deletion of these REP sequences from the chromosomal operon not only destabilizes upstream malE mRNA, but also results in a 9-fold reduction in the synthesis of MalE protein. A single REP sequence seems to be as efficient as the two normally found in this intergenic region at stabilizing translationally active upstream mRNA. The widespread occurrence of REP sequences and other sequences that could potentially stabilize upstream mRNA suggests that this mechanism of control of gene expression may be rather common."
https://openalex.org/W2060473247,"The MotB protein of Escherichia coli is an essential component of the force generators that couple proton movement across the cytoplasmic membrane to rotation of the flagellar motors. The membrane topology of MotB was examined to explore the possibility that it might form a proton channel. MotB-alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins were constructed to identify likely periplasmic domains of the MotB molecule. Fusions distal to a putative membrane-spanning segment near the amino terminus of MotB exhibited alkaline phosphatase activity, indicating that an extensive carboxyl-terminal portion of MotB may be located on the periplasmic side of the membrane. Protease treatment of MotB in spheroplasts confirmed this view. The simple transmembrane organization of MotB is difficult to reconcile with a role as a proton conductor."

https://openalex.org/W2082437194,"Lambert-Eaton syndrome, an autoimmune disorder frequently associated with small-cell carcinoma of the lung, is characterized by impaired evoked release of acetylcholine from the motor nerve terminal. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies from patients with the syndrome, applied to bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, reduced the voltage-dependent calcium channel currents by about 40 percent. When calcium was administered directly into the cytoplasm, however, the IgG-treated cells exhibited normal exocytotic secretion, as assayed by membrane capacitance measurement. Measurement with the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2 indicated that the IgG treatment reduced potassium-stimulated increase in free intracellular calcium concentration. The pathogenic IgG modified neither kinetics of calcium channel activation nor elementary channel activity, suggesting that a reduction in the number of functional calcium channels underlies the IgG-induced effect. Therefore, Lambert-Eaton syndrome IgG reacts with voltage-dependent calcium channels and blocks their function, a phenomenon that can account for the presynaptic impairment characteristic of this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W1494827648,"125I-Labeled human platelet-derived transforming growth factor beta (125I-TGF-beta) and human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) formed a complex as demonstrated by 5% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 125I-TGF-beta.alpha 2M complex migrated at a position identical to that of the fast migrating form of alpha 2M. Most of the 125I-TGF-beta.alpha 2M complex could be dissociated by acid or urea treatment. When 125I-TGF-beta was incubated with serum, the high molecular weight form of 125I-TGF-beta could be immunoprecipitated by anti-human alpha 2M anti-sera as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. alpha 2M purified from platelet-rich plasma also showed the latent transforming growth factor activity and immunoreactivity of TGF-beta. These results suggest that TGF-beta.alpha 2M complex is a latent form of TGF-beta."
https://openalex.org/W1521987949,"Abstract Human hepatic lipase is an important enzyme in high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism, being implicated in the conversion of HDL2 to HDL3. Three human hepatic lipase cDNA clones were identified in two lambda gt11 libraries from human liver. The cDNA-derived amino acid sequence predicts a protein of 476 amino acid residues, preceded by a 23-residue signal peptide. Four potential N-glycosylation sites are identified, two of which are conserved in rat hepatic lipase. On alignment with human, mouse, and bovine lipoprotein lipase, the same two sites were also conserved in lipoprotein lipase in all three species. Stringent conservation of the cysteine residues was also evident. Comparative analysis of amino acid sequences shows that hepatic lipase evolves at a rapid rate, 2.07 x 10(-9) substitutions/site/year, about four times that in lipoprotein lipase and half that in pancreatic lipase. Further, hepatic lipase and pancreatic lipase appear to be evolutionarily closer to each other than either of them is to lipoprotein lipase. Southern blot analysis revealed high frequency restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the hepatic lipase gene for the enzymes HindIII and MspI. these polymorphisms will be useful for haplotype and linkage analysis of the hepatic lipase gene. Using cloned human hepatic lipase cDNA as a hybridization probe, we performed Southern blot analysis of a panel of 13 human-rodent somatic cell hybrids. Concordance analysis of the various hybrid clones indicates that the hepatic lipase gene is located on the long arm of human chromosome 15. Analysis of hybrids containing different translocations of chromosome 15 localized the gene to the region 15q15----q22."
https://openalex.org/W1898229949,"A number of different protein and peptide substrates were used to identify and characterize stimulated kinase activities in Xenopus oocyte extracts prepared during the major burst in protein phosphorylation that precedes meiotic cell division. While total cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in the cytosol was not stimulated, this kinase was the major kinase phosphorylating a number of the substrates and consequently had to be inhibited to prevent its masking cAMP-independent protein kinase activities. Sizable stimulations of kinase activities were then observed in extracts from progesterone-treated oocytes as compared to controls when the following substrates were utilized: Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) (8-fold); the synthetic peptide, Arg-Arg-Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Arg-Ala, the sequence of which is based on that of a phosphorylation site in ribosomal protein S6 (8-fold); ribosomal protein S6 (8-fold); histone H1 (5-fold); skeletal muscle glycogen synthase (3-fold); and myelin basic protein (30-fold). When these substrates were used to assay extracts fractionated on DEAE-Sephacel, at least three distinct peaks of stimulated kinase activity were detected, eluting at 0.12, 0.17, and 0.21 M NaCl. These peaks were tentatively designated M-phase Activated Kinases(s), MAK-H, MAK-S, and MAK-M, respectively. Using histone H1 as a selective probe for MAK-H and S6 peptide or Kemptide as probes for MAK-S, the kinase activities comprising these peaks were found to cycle with the meiotic cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1500915551,"Characterization of mammalian heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex protein A1 is reported after large-scale overproduction of the protein in Escherichia coli and purification to homogeneity. A1 is a single-stranded nucleic acid binding protein of 320 amino acids and 34,214 Da. The protein has two domains. The NH2-terminal domain is globular, whereas the COOH-terminal domain of about 120 amino acids has low probability of alpha-helix structure and is glycinerich. Nucleic acid binding properties of recombinant A1 were compared with those of recombinant and natural proteins corresponding to the NH2-terminal domain. A1 bound to single-stranded DNA-cellulose with higher affinity than the NH2-terminal domain peptides. Protein-induced fluorescence enhancement was used to measure equilibrium binding properties of the proteins. A1 binding to poly (ethenoadenylate) was cooperative with the intrinsic association constant of 1.5 X 10(5) M-1 at 0.4 M NaCl and a cooperativity parameter of 30. The NH2-terminal domain peptides bound noncooperatively and with a much lower association constant. With these peptides and with intact A1, binding was fully reversed by increasing [NaCl]; yet. A1 binding was much less salt-sensitive than binding by the NH2-terminal domain peptides. A synthetic polypeptide analog of the COOH-terminal domain was prepared and was found to bind tightly to poly-(ethenoadenylate). The results are consistent with the idea that the COOH-terminal domain contributes to A1 binding through both cooperative protein-protein interaction and direct interaction with the nucleic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1497977450,"Donnan potential (interior negative) across the outer membrane of Escherichia coli was measured by the distribution of [14C]choline in a mutant with a deletion through the genes for the active transport of choline. Calculation showed that the presence of membrane-derived oligosaccharides in the periplasm could quantitatively explain the magnitude of the Donnan potential and the periplasmic volume. By measuring the permeability of porin channels in intact cells suspended in solutions of widely different ionic strengths, it was shown that changing Donnan potential from 5 mV to approximately 100 mV had no effect on the permeability of either OmpF or OmpC porin channel toward a zwitterionic compound, cephaloridine. Thus, the voltage-dependent gating of porin channel, previously reported from another laboratory, is likely to be an artifact of in vitro reconstitution. The influx of negatively charged compounds, however, was affected by the Donnan potential as expected from the electrolyte diffusion theory."
https://openalex.org/W1589621417,"Protein C undergoes Ca2+-induced conformational changes required for activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. A Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody (HPC4) that blocks protein C activation was used to study conformational changes near the activation site in protein C. The half-maximal Ca2+ dependence was similar for protein C and gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid-domainless protein C for binding to HPC4 (205 +/- 23 and 110 +/- 29 microM Ca2+, respectively), activation rates (214 +/- 22 and 210 +/- 37 microM), and intrinsic fluorescence of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-domainless protein C (176 +/- 34 microM). Protein C heavy chain binding to HPC4 was half-maximal at 36 microM Ca2+, although neither the heavy chain nor HPC4 separately bound Ca2+ with high affinity. The epitope was lost when the activation peptide was released. A synthetic peptide, P (6-17), which spans the activation site, exhibited Ca2+-dependent binding to HPC4 (half-maximal binding = 6 microM Ca2+). Thus, each decrease in antigen structure resulted in a reduced Ca2+ requirement for binding to HPC4. Tb3+ and Ca2+ binding studies demonstrated a Ca2+-binding site in HPC4 required for high affinity antigen binding. These studies provide the first direct evidence for a Ca2+-induced conformational change in the activation region of a vitamin K-dependent zymogen. Furthermore, Ca2+ binding to HPC4 is required for antigen binding. The multiple roles of Ca2+ described may be useful in interpretation of other metal-dependent antibody/antigen interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1593344062,"To study the effects of 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 on the transcription of the human parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene, 684 base pairs of the 5‘-flanking portion of the human PTH gene were fused to the bacterial neo gene. The fusion gene was transfected into rat pituitary cells, and mixed populations of colonies were selected using the neomycin analog, G418. The level of RNA initiated from the human PTH gene promoter region in these cells was suppressed by 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3. Synthesis of the same transcript under control of a viral promoter was not regulated by 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3. The effect of 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 was detected within 24 h at physiologic doses of 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3, and was not influenced by addition of cycloheximide. Thus 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 acts on the 5‘-flanking portion of the PTH gene to decrease the rate of transcription by a mechanism that requires no new protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1524998338,"Tetrandrine, a bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloid derived from the Chinese medicinal herb Stephania tetrandra, is a putative Ca2+ entry blocker whose mechanism of action is unknown. To investigate this mechanism, the effects of tetrandrine were characterized on binding of three chemical classes of Ca2+ entry blockers in cardiac sarcolemmal membrane vesicles. In the range 25-37 degrees C, tetrandrine completely blocks diltiazem binding, partially inhibits D-600 binding, and markedly stimulates nitrendipine binding, with greatest enhancement occurring at 37 degrees C. The potency of tetrandrine is increased 10-fold as temperature is raised from 25 to 37 degrees C. Scatchard analyses indicate that inhibition of diltiazem binding and stimulation of nitrendipine binding result from changes in ligand affinities while inhibition of D-600 binding is due to both an increase in KD and decrease in Bmax of aralkylamine receptors. Ligand dissociation studies reveal that tetrandrine increases D-600 off-rates, decreases nitrendipine off-rates, but has no effect on diltiazem dissociation kinetics. In addition, tetrandrine reversibly blocks inward Ca2+ currents through L-type Ca2+ channels in GH3 anterior pituitary cells. These results indicate that tetrandrine interacts directly at the benzothiazepine-binding site of the Ca2+ entry blocker receptor complex and allosterically modulates ligand binding at other receptors in this complex. These findings suggest that tetrandrine is a structurally unique natural product Ca2+ entry blocker and provide a rationale explanation for the therapeutic effectiveness of this agent."

https://openalex.org/W1533711314,"Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzes the incorporation of 3-4 mol of phosphate into the alpha subunit of rat brain sodium channels in vitro or in situ. Digestion of phosphorylated sodium channels with CNBr yielded three major phosphorylated fragments of 25, 31, and 33 kDa. These fragments were specifically immunoprecipitated with site-directed antisera establishing their location within an intracellular loop between the first and second homologous domains containing residues 448 to 630 of sodium channel RI or residues 450-639 of sodium channel RII. Five of the seven major tryptic phosphopeptides generated from intact sodium channel alpha subunits were contained in each of the 25-, 31-, and 33-kDa CNBr fragments, indicating that most cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites are in this domain. Since CNBr digestion of sodium channels which had been metabolically labeled with 32P in intact neurons yielded the same phosphorylated fragments, the phosphorylated region we have identified is the major location of phosphorylation in situ. Only serine residues were phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro, while approximately 16% of the phosphorylation in intact neurons was on threonine residues that must lie outside the domain we have identified. Since this domain is phosphorylated in intact neurons, our results show that it is located on the intracellular side of the plasma membrane. These results are considered with respect to models for the transmembrane orientation of the alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1790646394,Substance P (SP) may play an important role in the interactions between the nervous system and the immune system. Astrocytes carry receptors for SP on their surfaces. We examined whether ligand-induced receptor activation would lead to the release of arachidonic acid metabolites. SP (10(-10)-10(-8) M) evokes the formation of prostaglandin E and thromboxane B2 in a dose-dependent manner. Structure-activity studies disclosed that the COOH-terminal peptide sequence of SP is primarily responsible for this biological activity. The generation by astrocytes of arachidonate-derived proinflammatory and immunoregulatory compounds in response to SP receptor activation may be relevant to immunoinflammatory responses within the central nervous system and emphasizes the concept of neuroimmunomodulation.
https://openalex.org/W1521956385,"In order to explore whether individual N-linked glycans in a given glycoprotein may be processed to different end products and at the same time prepare a number of well characterized glycopeptides as substrates for glycopeptide hydrolases, we have prepared the individual glycopeptides representing the four major glycosylation sites in ovomucoid and the three sites in asialofetuin. The individual glycopeptides were characterized by amino acid sequence determination before and after removal of the glycan by peptide:N-glycanase (amidase), and the liberated glycans were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. As expected from available sugar analyses of the individual glycans in ovomucoid, no major differences were detected between the four glycosylation sites in this glycoprotein, but a definite trend toward less processed (less extensively branched) species was observed in going from site 1 to 4. In fetuin, for which the glycan pool is known to be made up of about two-thirds triantennary and one-third biantennary structures, the analysis of the three glycopeptides gave triantennary to biantennary ratios of 75/25, 67/33, and 70/30, respectively, demonstrating that the three sites are processed to a very similar, albeit perhaps not identical, extent. All the glycopeptides obtained in these studies, including the CNBr-produced glycopeptide from ovalbumin, were purified by a set series of steps, gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 followed by ion-exchange chromatography on DE52 and/or reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Based on the results, these procedures appear to have general application for the preparation of glycopeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1572273862,"Abstract The mechanism of the cAMP involvement in regulation of cellular functions was studied here using a novel functional assay (antigen receptor-triggered exocytosis of granules) of cloned cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). We suggest that cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase A, counteracts the protein kinase C and Ca2+-mediated stimulatory T-cell antigen receptor (TcR)-triggered biochemical pathway. This suggestion is supported by experimental results which satisfy criteria for protein kinase A involvement in cellular functions. Pretreatment of CTL with cholera toxin induces cAMP accumulation in CTL, partially inhibits TcR-triggered lethal hit delivery to the target cell, and almost completely blocks TcR-triggered exocytosis of granules from CTL. Other agents that raise the intracellular level of cAMP, including forskolin and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) also inhibit TcR-triggered CTL activation. Involvement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in an inhibitory pathway is suggested by the synergistic effects of cyclic nucleotide analogs 8-bromo-cAMP and N6-benzoyl-cAMP in inhibition of TcR-triggered exocytosis. Forskolin and IBMX inhibited TcR-triggered phosphoinositide turnover in CTL, suggesting that cAMP affected very early events in signal transduction that follow TcR cross-linking by a ligand. The ability of IBMX to inhibit CTL activation when the TcR cross-linking step was by-passed by the combination of phorbol myristate acetate and ionophore A23187 suggests that the locus of inhibitory effect of cAMP is at both the early and late stages of the TcR-triggered transmembrane signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1500748322,"Using antisera raised against partially purified rabbit mammary gland prolactin receptor, we have isolated a cDNA from a T-47D human breast cancer cell expression library which encodes the putative calcium-binding protein, calcyclin. Since the protein encoded by this cDNA co-purified with the prolactin receptor, we have tentatively named it a prolactin receptor-associated protein (PRA). Hybrid selection and in vitro translation showed that the protein encoded by this cDNA was approximately 10 kDa, a result confirmed by the amino acid sequence derived after DNA sequencing analysis. The PRA gene product has significant sequence similarity to the S-100 proteins, the cystic fibrosis antigen, and p11 proteins. The PRA/calcyclin cDNA obtained from the T-47D human breast cancer cell library has 37 nucleotides more 5'-untranslated information than that of the calcyclin cDNA from human fibroblasts. Since the transcription start site for the calcyclin gene has been confirmed in fibroblasts, our data suggest that a different transcription start site may be used in the T-47D cells. Isolation and nucleotide sequencing of the rat PRA cDNA showed there was 96% predicted amino acid sequence similarity with the human PRA and confirmed the highly conserved nature of the PRA/calcyclin gene between species. The PRA is expressed in most but not all human breast cancer cell lines, e.g. MCF 7. Northern analyses of RNAs from rat tissue indicated that PRA mRNA levels vary widely. They are low in the liver, brain, testes, and ovary, moderate in skeletal muscle, and high in the lung, kidney, and uterus. The availability of prolactin receptor-positive human breast cancer cell lines, which do (T-47D) and do not (MCF 7) express the PRA/calcyclin gene, will allow the investigation of the role, if any, of PRA in prolactin action."
https://openalex.org/W1593749863,"Sigma is a 340- or 341-base pair repetitive element which is located almost exclusively within 19 base pairs of the 5' ends of various tRNA genes in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Although most sigma elements characterized to date are isolated insertions, a few of the elements occur relatively closely spaced. One of these pairs is a direct repeat of the sigma element separated by an internal domain 4.7 kilobase pairs in length. Not only does this structure resemble a composite transposable element, but regions within the sigma elements and intervening domain are homologous to conserved regions in retroviruses and retrotransposons of yeast and other organisms. Two features suggest that the sigma elements and intervening DNA transposed in a concerted event: only one of the two sigma elements is associated with a tRNA gene, and only the outside ends of the two elements are flanked by the 5-base pair direct repeats that usually flank individual sigma insertions. Examination of genomic DNA from five laboratory strains indicates that the 4.7 kilobase pair internal domain is present in one to four copies per haploid genome and that the genomic location of this domain differs from strain to strain. In addition, Northern blot analysis showed the presence of a 5.2 kilobase poly(A) transcript which hybridizes to both sigma and internal domain-specific probes. The existence of this composite element may suggest new ways to consider the mechanisms by which retrotransposons select their targets."
https://openalex.org/W1559896105,"Ionic flux is most likely to regulate the chemiosmotic potential differences across vacuolysosomal membranes in animal, plant, and fungal cells. We found a membrane potential-dependent cation channel in yeast vacuolar membrane and characterized its several features by an electrophysiological method using artificial planar bilayer membranes incorporated with isolated yeast vacuolar membrane vesicles. This ion channel conducts K+ (single channel conductance, 435 pS in 0.3 M KCl) and several other monovalent cations (Cs+, Na+, and Li+) with broad selectivity, but does not conduct Cl-. The opening of this channel is regulated by the membrane potential and the presence of calcium ion on the cytoplasmic face. These characteristics suggested that the vacuolar cation channel functions as one of essential components for formation and regulation of the chemical and electrical potential differences across the vacuolar membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1580567817,"When rat liver mitochondria are allowed to accumulate Ca2+, treated with ruthenium red to inhibit reverse activity of the Ca2+ uniporter, and then treated with an uncoupler, they release Ca2+ and endogenous Mg2+ and undergo large amplitude swelling with ultrastructural expansion of the matrix space. These effects are not produced by Ca2+ plus uncoupler alone. Like other Ca2+-releasing agents (i.e. N-ethylmaleimide, t-butylhydroperoxide, oxalacetate, etc.), the development of nonspecific permeability produced by ruthenium red plus uncoupler requires accumulated Ca2+ specifically and is antagonized by inhibitors of phospholipase A2. The permeability responses are also antagonized by ionophore A23187, indicating that a rapid pathway for Ca2+ efflux from deenergized mitochondria is necessary to prevent the development of nonspecific permeability. EGTA can be substituted for ruthenium red to produce the nonspecific permeability change in Ca2+-loaded, uncoupler-treated mitochondria. The permeability responses to EGTA plus uncoupler again require accumulated Ca2+ specifically and are antagonized by inhibitors of phospholipase A2 and by ionophore A23187. The equivalent effects of ruthenium red and EGTA on uncoupled, Ca2+-containing mitochondria indicate that reducing the extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration to the subnanomolar range produces inhibition of reverse uniport activity. It is proposed that inhibition reflect regulation of the uniporter by a Ca2+ binding site which is available from the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. EDTA cannot substitute for EGTA to induce nonspecific permeability in Ca2+-loaded, uncoupled mitochondria. Furthermore, EDTA inhibits the response to EGTA with an I50 value of approximately 10 microM. These data suggest that the uniporter regulatory site also binds Mg2+. The data suggest further that Mg2+ binding to the regulatory site is necessary to inhibit reverse uniport activity, even when the site is not occupied by Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1601150829,"The hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol may generate multiple second messengers, including inositol phosphates, 1,2-diacylglycerol, arachidonic acid, and phosphatidic acid. Here, we describe for the first time in spermatozoa that accumulation of one of these potential second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1,4,5-IP3), can be stimulated by the fucose-sulfate glycoconjugate (FSG) that induces an acrosome reaction. Sea urchin spermatozoa were labeled with myo-[3H]inositol and incubated with FSG. The amount of [3H]1,4,5-IP3 obtained from FSG-treated cells was up to 10 times that from untreated cells. Increases in the amount of [3H]1,4,5-IP3 were detected within 30 s after addition of FSG (2.5-fold) and were highest at 2 min after addition. Previously, it was shown that FSG induces Ca2+-dependent increases in cyclic AMP concentrations (Kopf, G. S., and Garbers, D. L. (1980) Biol. Reprod. 22, 1118-1126). Increases in [3H]1,4,5-IP3 accumulation caused by FSG were also dependent on extracellular Ca2+. The Ca2+ channel blockers, verapamil and nifedipine, inhibited increases in both [3H]1,4,5-IP3 and cyclic AMP, and the addition of concentrations of extracellular Ca2+ higher than 9.6 mM could reduce the inhibition. When spermatozoa were incubated in Ca2+-free seawater, FSG-induced increases in [3H]1,4,5-IP3 and cyclic AMP concentrations were blocked; addition of extracellular Ca2+ restored the responses. Other treatments that result in the induction of an acrosome reaction, including the addition of monovalent cation H+ exchangers, nigericin and gramicidin S, and incubation in seawater at alkaline pH (pH 8.8), also stimulated accumulation of [3H]1,4,5-IP3 and cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1588880945,"In the present study we investigated the role of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme)-mediated processes in the regulation of proenkephalin gene expression in primary cultures of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. Activators of protein kinase C such as 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, mezerein, and the phorbol esters phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and phorbol 12,13-didecanoate induced a time-dependent increase in proenkephalin mRNA levels, whereas the inactive phorbol ester 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate had no effect. The increase in phorbol ester-induced proenkephalin mRNA was potentiated by low concentrations of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, suggesting an interaction between protein kinase- and Ca2+-mediated processes in the regulation of proenkephalin mRNA. The phorbol ester-induced stimulation does not appear to be mediated by an interaction with the cAMP-generating system or increases in Ca2+ uptake. However, when proenkephalin mRNA levels were stimulated by KCl (10 mM) and the dihydropyridine BayK8644, PMA exhibited an inhibitory effect on proenkephalin mRNA, which was detectable at a 10-fold lower concentration of PMA than the stimulatory effect. This inhibitory effect appears to be mediated by an inhibition of Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, as suggested by 45Ca2+ uptake experiments. Thus, the net effect of PMA depends on and varies with the state of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel activity. A third mode of action by protein kinase C to modulate proenkephalin gene expression is by interaction with the phosphatidylinositol second messenger system. Stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis and proenkephalin mRNA by histaminic H1-receptor activation was inhibited by low concentrations of PMA. We suggest that protein kinase C may act as a positive and negative regulator of proenkephalin gene expression by interacting with at least three receptor-coupled second messenger systems."
https://openalex.org/W1551370715,"The novel post-translationally modified residue gamma-N-methylasparagine, previously detected in the beta subunit of allophycocyanin (Klotz, A. V., Leary, J. A., and Glazer, A. N. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15891-15894), has been found in the beta subunits of a variety of other phycobiliproteins. Representatives of C- and R-phycocyanins and B-, C-, and R-phycoerythrins all contain 1 eq of gamma-N-methylasparagine on their beta subunits as judged by the presence of methylamine in acid hydrolysates. Radiotracer experiments show that the methyl group is derived from the S-methyl of methionine, implicating S-adenosylmethionine as an intermediate methyl transfer agent. Isolation of peptides from C-phycocyanins, prepared from cells labeled by L-[methyl-14C]methionine, showed that the gamma-N-methylasparagine residue is at position beta-72, within a highly conserved region in phycobiliproteins. This location corresponds to that reported earlier for the position of gamma-N-methylasparagine in allophycocyanin and R-phycoerythrin. Phycobiliprotein alpha subunits contain insignificant amounts of the adduct. Methylamine is absent from the hydrolysates of the beta subunits or alpha beta monomers of phycobiliproteins from certain organisms. These latter data indicate that the gamma-N-methylasparagine residue is dispensable in some circumstances. The function of this modification remains to be established. gamma-N-methylasparagine was also absent from several other proteins including bovine histones, porcine myelin basic peptide, and the Salmonella typhimurium aspartate chemoreceptor, all known to undergo post-translational methylations."
https://openalex.org/W1523684653,"Experiments were conducted to investigate structural features of the aminoacyl stem region of precursor histidine tRNA critical for the proper cleavage by the catalytic RNA component of RNase P that is responsible for 5' maturation. Histidine tRNA was chosen for study because tRNAHis has an 8 base pair instead of the typical 7-base pair aminoacyl stem. The importance of the 3' proximal CCA sequence in the 5'-processing reaction was also investigated. Our results show that the tRNAHis precursor patterned after the natural Bacillus subtilis gene is cleaved by catalytic RNAs from B. subtilis or Escherichia coli, leaving an extra G residue at the 5'-end of the aminoacyl stem. Replacing the 3' proximal CCA sequence in the substrate still allowed the catalytic RNA to cleave at the proper position, but it increased the Km of the reaction. Changing the sequence of the 3' leader region to increase the length of the aminoacyl stem did not alter the cleavage site but reduced the reaction rate. However, replacing the G residue at the expected 5' mature end by an A changed the processing site, resulting in the creation of a 7-base pair aminoacyl stem. The Km of this reaction was not substantially altered. These experiments indicate that the extra 5' G residue in B. subtilis tRNAHis is left on by RNase P processing because of the precursor's structure at the aminoacyl stem and that the cleavage site can be altered by a single base change. We have also shown that the catalytic RNA alone from either B. subtilis or E. coli is capable of cleaving a precursor tRNA in which the 3' proximal CCA sequence is replaced by other nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1545437997,"Insects transport lipid for flight in the form of diacylglycerol-rich low density lipoproteins (low density lipophorin (LDLp)). A hybrid LDLp has been produced in vitro by using Locusta migratoria fat body, locust high density lipophorin, locust adipokinetic hormone, and Manduca sexta apolipophorin III (apoLp-III). The hybrid is similar in size and density to locust LDLp, contains several molecules of M. sexta apoLp-III, and lacks locust apoLp-III, as shown by immunochemical methods. Under the same conditions an apoLp-III from Thasus acutangulus is poorly incorporated into the locust lipoprotein. The role of apoLp-III as a recognition signal/activator of flight muscle lipoprotein lipase was assayed with labeled hybrid LDLp produced in vitro using M. sexta apoLp-III radiolabeled with 35S. In addition, hydrolysis of diacylglycerol was determined with lipid-labeled hybrid LDLp produced in vitro using [U-14C]glycerol incorporated into the diacylglycerol moiety. In vitro incubations of the labeled hybrid LDLp with L. migratoria flight muscles show that the lipase efficiently utilizes hybrid LDLp as a substrate and demonstrate that the carbohydrate moiety of locust apoLp-III (which is lacking in the M. sexta protein) is not required for interaction with the lipase. It also suggests that specific antigenic determinants of L. migratoria apoLp-III are not required for lipase activation since M. sexta apoLp-III lacks immunological cross-reactivity with L. migratoria apoLp-III."

About 60% of the incorporated radioactivity is found in a 75-kDa protein containing [32P] phosphoserine. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified 75-kDa [32P]phosphoprotein is identical to that of vitronectin (also termed serum spreading factor or complement S protein). Rabbit antiserum against vitronectin precipitates greater than 90% of the 75-kDa [32P]phosphoprotein from plasma. Reverse phase chromatography of [32P]vitronectin degraded sequentially with CNBr and chymotrypsin yields one major labeled peptide. The sequence of the peptide, Ser-Arg-Arg-Pro-[32PO4]Ser-Arg-Ala-Thr, corresponds to residues 374-381 which are located in the heparin-binding fragment of vitronectin identified by Suzuki et al. [1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 15307-15314). Vitronectin could potentially be phosphorylated in vivo with ATP released from injured cells or secreted by platelets activated during hemostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1666918266,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulated the formation of inositol trisphosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol phosphate in density-arrested BALB/c/3T3 cells pretreated for 1.5-4 h with cholera toxin, a potent activator of adenyl cyclase, and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Concomitant addition of cholera toxin, IBMX, and EGF to cells did not increase inositol phosphate levels, and pretreatment with both agents was more effective than pretreatment with either alone. Pre-exposure of cells to cholera toxin and IBMX also enhanced the increase in inositol phosphates occurring in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Preincubation of cells with cholera toxin and IBMX in the presence of cycloheximide abolished the effects of these agents on EGF- and PDGF-stimulated inositol phosphate production as well as the lesser increase in inositol phosphate formation produced by cholera toxin and IBMX in the absence of hormone. Preincubation of cells with cycloheximide did not affect EGF binding or the ability of PDGF to stimulate inositol phosphate formation. Cycloheximide also precluded EGF-induced inositol phosphate production when presented to cells 3 h after addition of cholera toxin and IBMX. These findings show that, under the appropriate conditions, EGF is capable of stimulating inositol phosphate formation in a nontransformed cell line."
https://openalex.org/W2085527121,"Plasmid ColE1 can replicate using RNAase H and DNA polymerase I. However, it can also replicate in the absence of these enzymes. In this case, formation of a persistent hybrid between a transcript (RNA II) and the DNA indirectly activates subsequent DNA synthesis, instead of providing a primer as it does in the presence of these enzymes. To activate DNA synthesis, a certain length is required for the hybridized region and the region of minimum length cannot include a palindrome. These results show that the single-stranded region of DNA displaced by the hybridization is responsible for the activation. A single-stranded region was identified on the nontranscribed strand by its enhanced reactivity to dimethyl sulfate. The necessary length for the single-stranded region is at least 40 nucleotides. The region probably provides a site for initial binding of a helicase that further unwinds the template DNA for initiation of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1567582484,"A monoclonal antibody, mAb 1A, previously shown to recognize the dihydropyridine (DHP)-binding complex in rabbit muscle transverse tubules, inhibits voltage-sensitive calcium channel activity in a mouse muscle cell line. mAb 1A applied externally to BC3H1 muscle cells produced a concentration-dependent attenuation of the slowly-activating, DHP-sensitive, high-threshold calcium current. mAb 1A had no direct effect on either the rapidly-activating, DHP-insensitive, low-threshold calcium current or the delayed outward potassium current. However, sodium current kinetics were altered. On Western blot analysis of immunoaffinity-purified protein solubilized from BC3H1 membranes, mAb 1A recognized a Mr 210,000 polypeptide that is an analogous to the alpha 1 subunit of the DHP-binding complex from skeletal muscle. These results suggest that an extracellular segment of the alpha 1 subunit of the DHP-binding complex plays a functionally important role in voltage-gated calcium currents."
https://openalex.org/W1546678135,"Photoreactive derivatives of alpha- and beta-scorpion toxins have been used to analyze the subunit composition of Na+ channels in rat brain. In synaptosomes, both types of toxins preferentially labeled (greater than 85%) a component of 34,000 Da and, at a lower level, another component of 300,000 Da. Reduction of disulfide bridges shifted this latter band from 300,000 Da to 272,000 Da but did not modify the migration of the 34,000-Da component. Similarly, two bands were labeled in cultured brain neurons, one at 259,000 Da by alpha-scorpion toxins and the other at 34,000 Da by both alpha- and beta-scorpion toxins. Contrary to what was observed in synaptosomes, in cultured brain neurons reduction of disulfide bridges had no effect on the migration of the labeled high molecular weight component. Labeling of the smaller polypeptide was obtained even when cells were solubilized with sodium dodecyl sulfate immediately after cross-linking which proves that the 34,000-Da component is not a product of proteolysis. Binding sites for alpha- and beta-scorpion toxins, respectively, did not develop in parallel during neuronal maturation in culture: the increase in beta-scorpion toxin-binding site density was lower and later than that for alpha-scorpion toxin. When related to morphological development, the increase in alpha-scorpion toxin-binding sites was correlated to neurite growth, whereas the increase in beta-scorpion toxin-binding sites was associated with the development of chemical synapses. Finally, in cultured neurons, but not in synaptosomes, both the binding of beta-scorpion toxin and the labeling of the 34,000-Da component by beta-scorpion toxin were enhanced by depolarization of the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1569578370,"The substrate deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) binding site of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) reverse transcriptase was labeled with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), a substrate binding site-directed reagent for DNA polymerases (Modak, M. J. (1976) Biochemistry 15, 3620-3626). Treatment of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase with PLP results in the loss of RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, but has no effect on ribonuclease H activity. Neither template-primer nor substrate dNTP alone shows any protective effect from PLP-mediated inactivation. However, the presence of both template-primer and complementary substrate dNTP significantly protects M-MuLV reverse transcriptase from PLP inhibition. Using tritiated sodium borohydride to label the pyridoxylated enzyme, approximately 4 mol of PLP were incorporated per mol of enzyme. In the presence of template-primer and the complementary dNTP, however, only 2 mol of PLP were incorporated. Comparative tryptic peptide mapping of enzyme, modified in the presence and absence of substrates by PLP reaction on C-18 reverse phase columns, indicated the protection of two peptides from pyridoxylation in the presence of substrate triphosphate. These two peptides were further purified and characterized by amino acid analyses and sequencing and were found to span residues 103 to 110 and 412 to 425 in the primary amino acid sequence of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase. Furthermore, Lys-103 of peptide I and Lys-421 of peptide II were found to be the targets of pyridoxylation, indicating that these 2 lysine residues are involved in substrate dNTP binding in M-MuLV reverse transcriptase."
https://openalex.org/W1516990313,"We have recently described the characterization and expression of a murine gene highly homologous to the human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases/erythroid potentiating activity (TIMP/EPA) gene. We have also reported that expression of this gene is regulated in response to virus infection. In the present report we describe the use of a cDNA clone derived from mRNA isolated from Newcastle disease virus-induced murine cells to direct in vitro synthesis of proteins encoded by this murine TIMP/EPA gene. This approach was used to analyze structural and functional parameters of the TIMP/EPA protein. Translation experiments using microsomes revealed a murine protein similar in size to that of human TIMP: Mr of approximately 22,000 for the core protein and 28,000 for the processed protein. Processing in microsomes involved N-glycosylation and cleavage of the signal peptide. Both the processed and unprocessed proteins were able to inhibit degradation of collagen by collagenase but unable to inhibit virus replication. Synthesis of truncated TIMP proteins showed that the collagenase-inhibiting activity was not encoded within a delimited portion of the molecule. This result suggests that conformation is probably essential for TIMP activity."
https://openalex.org/W1597942878,"The major nucleocapsid protein of avian retroviruses, pp 12, binds to single-stranded viral RNA with high affinity. Phosphorylation at Ser-40 is necessary for this binding. In order to examine the role of phosphorylation of serine 40 in the biological function of pp 12, we have introduced a series of amino acid substitutions at this position in the Rous sarcoma virus (Pr-C) protein. Substitution of threonine, alanine, or three other amino acids for Ser-40 had very little or no detectable effect on viral replication, nor did the control substitution of glycine for Ser-43, a nonphosphorylated residue. In vivo and in vitro, the Ala-40 and probably the Thr-40 substituted p 12 proteins are phosphorylated at alternative sites which are phosphorylated to a minor extent in vivo in the wild type protein. A study of the RNA binding properties of Ala-40 substituted p 12 has indicated that the protein has been stabilized in a high affinity RNA binding state which is independent of phosphorylation. The viability of the Ala-40 mutant virus indicates that this high binding affinity may be required for biological activity."

DNase I protection experiments indicate that wild-type TFIIIA, synthesized from a full-length TFIIIA cDNA, binds specifically to the coding and noncoding strands of the 5 S RNA gene. The TFIIIA deletion mutant, expressed from TFIIIA cDNA lacking the coding sequence for the N-terminal 29 amino acids, fails to bind specifically to the 5 S RNA gene as judged by its inability to protect to any degree the coding or noncoding strands of the gene from DNase I digestion. Both wild-type TFIIIA and the N-terminal deletion mutant promote DNA renaturation."
https://openalex.org/W2096469765,"Proteolysis of human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) in the bait region is the prerequisite and necessary trigger for the trapping of the proteinase by a massive conformational change of alpha 2M. This labilization of the native conformation of alpha 2M is mediated by activation of the internal thiolesters, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. We now describe observations on proteolysis of human alpha 2M without concomitant hydrolysis of the internal thiolesters or conformational change. This proteolysis was obtained with a novel bacterial proteinase we recently used to isolate the receptor-binding domain from alpha 2M (Van Leuven, F., Marynen, P., Sottrup-Jensen, L., Cassiman, J.-J., and Van Den Berghe, H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11369-11373). This proteinase is not inhibited by alpha 2M, and therefore it was possible to study its effect on native alpha 2M at pH 4.5, conditions used previously to produce the receptor-binding domain (Van Leuven, F., Marynen, P., Sottrup-Jensen, L., Cassiman, J.-J., and Van Den Berghe, H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11369-11373). The major observations are that despite extensive proteolysis, alpha 2M largely retained its native conformation as shown by rate electrophoresis, the absence of binding of monoclonal antibody F2B2, and the incorporation of [14C]methylamine into a 145-kDa fragment of alpha 2M. Moreover, the derivative still bound trypsin to 88% of control values. Treatment of the derivative with trypsin or methylamine produced the conformational change as with intact alpha 2M, and concomitantly released the receptor-binding domain. This indicated that proteolysis at Lys1313-Glu also proceeded in native alpha 2M. At least one more major proteolysis site was deduced from the observation of a 27-kDa heat-induced fragment, the 145-kDa [14C]methylamine-labeled fragment, and from the presence of the 20-kDa receptor-binding domain. These results demonstrate indirectly the particular relation of the bait region to the internal thiolesters and illustrate further the domain-structure of alpha 2M and the expression of the receptor-recognition site by activation of the internal thiolesters."
https://openalex.org/W1522886621,"The expression of a human histone H1 gene (Hh8c H1) was studied in several different human cell lines. Nuclease S1 analysis revealed that this gene is expressed at high levels in KB cells and that it is regulated during the cell cycle, but that it is not expressed in several other human cell lines (HeLa, HEK, 293, and Hep G2). The differential expression of the Hh8c H1 gene in vivo was not due to gross chromosomal rearrangements or to activation of the entire histone gene cluster at this genomic locus. Thus, the cell type-specific expression of this human H1 gene must result from either critical differences in the promoter sequences of this gene in KB and HeLa cells, or from cell-specific utilization of trans-acting transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1550785571,"Mouse interferons beta (IFN-beta) and gamma (IFN-gamma) inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts into adipocytes when added to cultures at the time of induction of differentiation. Differentiation, as measured by incorporation of radiolabeled leucine into lipids, was inhibited 50% by approximately 1-3 units/ml of either IFN-beta or IFN-gamma, with maximum inhibition of differentiation achieved with 100 units/ml of either IFN. The magnitude of antiviral activity induced by IFN-beta and IFN-gamma was similar in differentiated and undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells, although the slopes of the dose-response curves were different; IFN-gamma induced an antiviral state with greater efficiency than IFN-beta in differentiated and undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells. By contrast, IFN-beta induced the double-stranded RNA-dependent P1 protein kinase more efficiently than did IFN-gamma in both differentiated and undifferentiated cells. However, IFN-beta and IFN-gamma both induced greater phosphorylation of protein P1 in cell-free extracts prepared from differentiated adipocytes than in extracts from undifferentiated fibroblasts. Cultures treated with either beta or gamma IFN throughout 8 days of differentiation continued to produce double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase in a manner dependent on IFN dose. These results suggest that the antiviral and antidifferentiative activities of IFN-beta and IFN-gamma in 3T3-L1 cells involve different molecular mechanisms."
