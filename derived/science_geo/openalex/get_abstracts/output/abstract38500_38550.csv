https://openalex.org/W2107624922,"A native gel electrophoresis DNA binding assay was used to resolve complexes formed on the adenovirus Major Late Promoter by general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. Five sets of complexes containing distinct components were identified. These complexes were generated by sequential binding of TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, RNA polymerase II, and TFIIE. The relative positions of each of the factors in the complexes were determined by DNAase I footprint analysis. TFIIA, derived from yeast or mammalian cells, formed a complex with yeast TFIID and the TATA element. TFIIB bound to this complex and probably acts as a ""bridge"" to the polymerase and the initiation site. The addition of ATP or dATP, necessary for ""activation"" of transcription, resulted in an alteration of the footprint in the +20 to +30 region, the same area protected upon addition of TFIIE to the initiation complex. Addition of ribonucleotide triphosphates generated new complexes that contained accurately initiated transcripts associated with the transcription machinery and the template DNA. A model for the interactions of components in initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II is proposed."

Since epidermal hyperplasia and angiogenesis are hallmarks of psoriasis, TGF-alpha gene expression was analyzed in epidermal biopsies of normal and psoriatic skin. TGF-alpha messenger RNA and protein are much more abundant in lesional psoriatic epidermis than in normal-appearing skin of psoriatic patients or in normal epidermis. In contrast, messenger RNA levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), which inhibits epithelial cell growth, are not significantly different in normal, uninvolved, and lesional psoriatic epidermis. Thus, psoriatic epidermal hyperplasia may involve increased expression of a keratinocyte mitogen (TGF-alpha) rather than deficient expression of a growth inhibitor (TGF-beta 1)."
https://openalex.org/W1500080863,"The literature suggests that cholesterol and sphingomyelin might be essentially confined to plasma membranes in mammalian cells; however, this premise has thus far escaped a direct test. We explored the issue in three ways. First, we fractionated whole homogenates of cultured human fibroblasts by equilibrium sucrose density gradient centrifugation. We found that the profiles of cholesterol and sphingomyelin were indistinguishable from those of two plasma membrane markers, 5′ nucleotidase and [3H]galactose, which was conjugated to the surface of intact cells from an exogenous donor by galactosyltransferase. Second, we determined the relative surface areas of intact cells from their uptake of 1-(4-trimethyl-amino)phenyl-6-phenylhexa-1,3,5-triene, a cationic fluorescent dye which partitions into but does not cross plasma membranes. Relative to human red cell ghosts, the apparent surface area of the fibroblasts was 17,500 em2/cell while for canine hepatocytes, the value was 11,500 em2/cell. The relative ratios of cell cholesterol to dye binding (hence, surface area) were quite similar in ghosts, fibroblasts, and liver cells; namely 1.0, 1.12, and 0.67, respectively. Finally, we found that the specific ratios of both cholesterol and sphingomyelin to 5′ nucleotidase were only 10% less in gradient-purified plasma membranes than in whole homogenates. Similar results were obtained using an entirely different method of purification: two-phase aqueous partition. The cholesterol and sphingomyelin in fractions rich in other membranes was closely proportional to their 5′ nucleotidase content, suggesting that the presence of these lipids reflected contamination by plasma membrane fragments. The 5′ nucleotidase/phospholipid ratio in the purified plasma membrane fraction was roughly twice that in whole cells. We conclude that the compartment marked by 5′ nucleotidase in cultured human fibroblasts contains approximately 90% of the two named lipids and half the cell phospholipid phosphorus."

https://openalex.org/W1976116530,"Nimodipine is one of several dihydropyridines that block calcium channels. Originally administered to improve cerebral blood flow in elderly patients with chronic cerebrovascular disorders, nimodipine was noted to facilitate learning. These observations led to the present investigation of the effects of nimodipine on associative learning in aging rabbits. Nimodipine accelerated acquisition of conditioned eye-blink in both young and aging rabbits without altering the amplitude of responses to the conditioned or unconditioned stimuli or causing nonspecific responding. Thus, nimodipine may be a candidate for an effective treatment for age-related learning deficits."
https://openalex.org/W1676406316,"Recent work from this laboratory revealed that glucose-derived pyrroles can form with model amines under physiological conditions (Niroge, F. G., Sayre, L. M., and Monnier, V. M. (1987) Carbohydr. Res. 167, 211-220). The major extractable product, 5-hydroxymethyl-1-alkylpyrrole-2-carbaldehyde (named by us pyrraline) was labile to acid hydrolysis. To allow its detection in proteins undergoing advanced glycosylation, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed. An immunogen consisting of epsilon-caproyl pyrraline (hapten) was linked onto poly-L-lysine (114:1) and used to raise polyclonal antibodies in the rabbit. High antibody titers were obtained 16 weeks after immunization. The antibody cross-reacted with butyl pyrraline (88%), propyl pyrraline (8%), lysyl pyrraline (2%), and neopentyl pyrraline (1.3%). A time-related increase in pyrraline immunoreactivity was observed in bovine serum albumin incubated with glucose (1000 mM), glycated lysine (50 mM), and 3-deoxyglucosone (50 mM) which reached 25, 300, and 350 pmol/mg, respectively, after 30 days. Mean level of protein pyrraline immunoreactivity were 27.0 +/- 7.2 and 43.3 +/- 11.7 pmol/mg in serum albumin from control and diabetic subjects, respectively (p less than 0.001). The pathobiological relevance of pyrraline may relate to its reported antiproteolytic and mutagenic properties. In addition, glucose-derived pyrroles may play a role in diabetic neuropathy in analogy to pyrroles formed during hexane-induced neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W1974625359,"Slowing of cardiac pacemaking induced by cholinergic input is thought to arise from the opening of potassium channels caused by muscarinic receptor stimulation. In mammalian sinoatrial node cells, however, muscarinic stimulation also inhibits the hyperpolarization-activated current (If), which is involved in the generation of pacemaker activity and its acceleration by catecholamines. Acetylcholine at nanomolar concentrations inhibits If and slows spontaneous rate, whereas 20 times higher concentrations are required to activate the acetylcholine-dependent potassium current (IK,Ach). Thus, modulation of If, rather than IK,Ach, is the mechanism underlying the muscarinic control of cardiac pacing at low (nanomolar) acetylcholine concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W153681275,"A full length cDNA clone of the platelet-derived growth factor-inducible KC gene has been isolated, sequenced, and expressed in COS cells. Both sequence analysis and expression studies indicate that KC encodes a secretory protein. Sequence analysis shows that, furthermore, the protein encoded by KC belongs to a growing superfamily of inducible proteins with a common ancestral linkage to the platelet alpha-granule proteins, platelet factor 4, and connective tissue-activating peptide III. A computer-generated phylogenetic tree documents interrelationships between KC and six additional members of this peptide superfamily. The KC gene is, in all probability, the murine homologue of a human gene termed gro. By extension, the KC protein is the murine counterpart of the protein encoded by the gro gene. The gro protein corresponds to a factor described as melanoma growth-stimulating activity."
https://openalex.org/W1492524414,"Abstract Types I, II, and III protein kinase C have been shown to be products of, respectively, gamma, beta, and alpha genes of this enzyme family (Huang, F. L., Yoshida, Y., Nakabayashi, H., Knopf, J. L., Young, W. S., III, and Huang, K.-P. (1987) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 149, 946-952). Incubation of the highly purified rat brain protein kinase C isozymes with trypsin (kinase/trypsin (w/w) = 100) under identical conditions results in a preferential degradation of types I and II enzymes, whereas the type III enzyme was relatively resistant to tryptic proteolysis. Degradation of the type III enzyme by trypsin could be facilitated with the addition of Ca2+, phosphatidylserine, and dioleoylglycerol; none of these components alone was effective. Limited proteolysis of the three protein kinase C isozymes generated distinctive fragments for each isozyme, indicating that each isozyme has different trypsin-sensitive sites. Tryptic digestion of the type III protein kinase C was used as a model to determine the effects of various modulators on protein kinase C degradation. While Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine together were sufficient to convert the type III protein kinase C from a trypsin-insensitive to a -sensitive form, addition of dioleoylglycerol greatly reduced the Ca2+ requirement for such a conversion. Among the various phospholipids tested, in the presence of either dioleoylglycerol or phorbol ester, phosphatidylserine, cardiolipin, and phosphatidic acid were the most effective, and phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were the least effective in supporting the digestion of type III protein kinase. Other acidic phospholipids, such as lysophosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, were also effective in supporting the degradation in the presence of phorbol ester but not in the presence of dioleoylglycerol. The relevance of these proteolytic reactions to physiological responses was assessed with phorbol ester on rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells, which contained both types II and III protein kinase C. Immunoblot analysis with the isozyme-specific antibodies revealed that phorbol ester induced a faster degradation of type II than that of type III isozyme in these cells. The results demonstrate that the various protein kinase C isozymes have different susceptibilities to proteolysis in vitro, when tested with trypsin, as well as to endogenous proteases in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W2050861719,"A novel approach to the control of enzyme catalysis is presented in which a disulfide bond engineered into the active-site cleft of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme is capable of switching the activity on and off. Two cysteines (Thr21 → Cys and Thr142 → Cys) were introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis into the active-site cleft. These cysteines spontaneously formed a disulfide bond under oxidative conditions in vitro, and the catalytic activity of the oxidized (cross-linked) T4 lysozyme was completely lost. On exposure to reducing agent, however, the disulfide bond was rapidly broken, and the reduced (non-cross-linked) lysozyme was restored to full activity. Thus an enzyme has been engineered such that redox potential can be used to control catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2045682255,"As the originator of the oxygen in our atmosphere, the photosynthetic water-splitting enzyme of chloroplasts is vital for aerobic life on the earth. It has a manganese cluster at its active site, but it is poorly understood at the molecular level. Polarized synchrotron radiation was used to examine the x-ray absorption of manganese in oriented chloroplasts. The manganese site, in the ""resting"" (S1) state, is an asymmetric cluster, which probably contains four manganese atoms, with interatomic separations of 2.7 and 3.3 angstroms; the vector formed by the 3.3-angstrom manganese pair is oriented perpendicular to the membrane plane. Comparisons with model compounds suggest that the cluster contains bridging oxide or hydroxide ligands connecting the manganese atoms, perhaps with carboxylate bridges connecting the 3.3-angstrom manganese pair."
https://openalex.org/W2171230527,"Most native antigens require processing in a cellular compartment for efficient presentation to T helper cells. The cellular elements that permit processing are not known. We investigated a possible role of the class II MHC-associated invariant chains in antigen processing. Fibroblast cells that were transfected with class II genes were compared with fibroblasts supertransfected with the invariant chain gene for their capacity to present the fifth component of complement (C5) to C5-specific class II restricted T cell clones or influenza virus protein to a virus-specific T cell clone. Only fibroblasts supertransfected with the invariant chain gene were able to present native antigen, even at very low antigen concentration, whereas both fibroblast types could present cyanogen bromide-fragmented C5 or the virus peptide. Presentation of intact antigen but not of fragmented antigen was totally abrogated by treatment of fibroblasts with chloroquine. The invariant chain gene encodes two polypeptides, li31 and li41. Expression of either li31 or li41 was sufficient to render class II-expressing fibroblasts capable of presenting intact antigen."
https://openalex.org/W1486997412,"Abstract We previously identified (Sobel, A., and Tashjian, A. H., Jr. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10312-10324) a group of cytoplasmic proteins whose phosphorylation could be related to the regulation by extracellular effectors of cells as different as pituitary and muscle cells. Among these phosphoproteins, proteins 7 and 8 (Mr approximately 19,000, pI approximately 5.8-6.0), that we now designate P1 and P2, are very abundant in rat brain. Partial purification of these proteins was therefore achieved after 100 degrees C precipitation of a rat brain-soluble fraction and further fractionation of the supernatant by ion exchange chromatography. Several related non-phosphorylated (N1, N2) and phosphorylated (P3) proteins were also identified in the heat-resistant supernatant. Antisera raised against P2 extracted from nitrocellulose blots of semipreparative two-dimensional gels recognized all the proteins N1, N2, P1, P2, and P3, confirming that they belong to the same protein family, and suggesting that they are likely various forms of a single protein core. The same protein could be detected biochemically and immunologically at various concentrations in all the tissues or cell types from diverse mammalian and nonmammalian species tested. Together with our previous data relating its phosphorylation to the regulation of the proliferation, differentiation, and/or the functions of the cells considered, this observation leads us to suggest that it might be an ubiquitous regulatory phosphoprotein playing the role of an intracellular relay for extracellular signals, after their binding to specific membrane receptors and the generation of second messengers. We propose to name this protein stathmin, from the greek stathmos (relay)."

https://openalex.org/W1539711494,"HNP-2 is a 29-residue peptide present in human neutrophils and is a member of the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. All defensins contain an invariant disulfide infrastructure comprised of 6 half-cystine residues. The disulfide structure of HNP-2 was determined using a novel method to identify the cross-links involving the amino- and carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues. A derivative of HNP-2 was synthesized by covalent modification of the terminal cysteine residues. This derivative was purified, characterized, and subjected to exhaustive proteolytic digestion. Characterization of purified proteolytic fragments by amino acid analysis and/or sequence analysis identified an oligopeptide containing all 6 cystine residues. This oligopeptide was subjected to a single cycle of Edman degradation to cleave the peptide bond linking 2 adjacent cysteines. Purification and characterization of the Edman reaction products allowed for assignment of the disulfide array in HNP-2, revealing a cystine motif unique to the defensin peptide family. Further, the covalent structure of HNP-2 was found to be cyclic as one disulfide links the amino- and carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues. HNP-2 is the only polypeptide known to possess such a configuration."
https://openalex.org/W1523841402,"Preferential use of endogenously generated intermediates by the enzymes of the urea cycle was observed using isolated rat hepatocytes made permeable to low molecular weight compounds with alpha-toxin. The permeabilized cells synthesized [14C]urea from added NH4Cl, [14C]HCO3-, ornithine, and aspartate, using succinate as a respiratory substrate; with all substrates saturating, about 4 nmol of urea were formed per min/mg dry weight of cells. Urea usually accounted for about 40-50% of the total (NH3 + ornithine)-dependent counts, arginine for less than 10%, and citrulline for about 30%. Very tight channeling of arginine between argininosuccinate lyase and arginase was shown by the fact that the addition of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled arginine to the incubations did not decrease the percentage of counts found in urea or increase that found in arginine, even though a substantial amount of the added arginine was hydrolyzed inside the cells. The channeling of argininosuccinate between its synthetase and lyase was demonstrated by similar observations; unlabeled argininosuccinate added in 200-fold excess decreased the percentage of counts in urea by only 25%. Channeling of citrulline from its site of synthesis by ornithine transcarbamylase in the mitochondrial matrix to argininosuccinate synthetase in the cytoplasmic space was also shown. These results strongly suggest that the three soluble cytoplasmic enzymes of the urea cycle are grouped around the mitochondria and are spatially organized within the cell in such a way that intermediates can be efficiently transferred between them."

https://openalex.org/W1485814019,"Fusion between membranes of 3T3 fibroblasts expressing hemagglutinin (HA) from the Japan strain of influenza virus and human red blood cells (RBC) was measured using an assay for lipid mixing based on the relief of self-quenching (dequenching) of fluorescence of the lipid probe octadecylrhodamine (R18). The probe was incorporated into the membrane of intact RBC at self-quenching concentrations, and the RBCs were bound to the 3T3 cells. Fusion, which allowed movement of R18 into 3T3 cell membranes, was monitored by spectrofluorometry as an increase in fluorescence. Upon lowering the pH below 5.4, the fluorescence increased after a delay of about 30 s at 37 °C, and leveled off within 2 min. In control experiments where R18 RBCs bound to 3T3 cells expressing the uncleaved precursor hemagglutinin (HA0) were incubated at 37 °C and low pH, no fluorescence increase was observed. This indicated that the R18 dequenching occurred as a result of HA-induced fusion of plasma membranes. Fusion showed a very steep pH dependence with a threshold at pH 5.4 and a maximum at pH 5.0, similar to HA-induced fusion seen previously using cell biological techniques. The fusion rate increased and the delay for the onset of fusion decreased as the temperature was raised above 20 °C. Low pH activation of the fusion process at 37 °C could be partially arrested by raising the pH after 2–10 s, but not after 15 s, indicating that the irreversible pH-activated conformational change of HA necessary for fusion was complete within about 15 s. Analysis of the data indicates that the pH-induced membrane fusion activity of HA is a highly cooperative event."
https://openalex.org/W2032602327,"Animals clearly choose what they eat and can even choose among chemically different sugars. The physiological and biochemical mechanisms that constrain feeding choices are largely unknown. In this study, European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) preferred mixture solutions of D-glucose plus D-fructose to equimolar (double molar caloric value) solutions of sucrose. Intubation feeding of sucrose did not increase blood glucose levels. Sucrose is a useless energy source for these birds because they lack a single digestive enzyme (sucrase) on the small intestinal brush border membrane. However, the membranes possessed separate maltase and isomaltase disaccharidases. This expression pattern and expression patterns of membrane disaccharidases among mammals suggest a role for intestinal enzymes in the coevolutionary interactions between vertebrates and their plant food sources."
https://openalex.org/W1999430419,"The dynamic character of phospholipid aggregates limits conventional structural studies to the determination of average molecular features. In order to develop more detailed descriptions of phospholipid structure for comparison with experiment, the molecular dynamics of a hydrated lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) micelle, incorporating 85 LPE and 1591 water molecules, have been simulated. Comparison of the initial and equilibrated micelles shows substantial differences both in LPE hydrocarbon chain conformation and polar head-group-solvent interactions. Although these changes produce only subtle effects on the averaged structural properties of the system, the alterations in hydrocarbon chain packing and head-group solvation appear to mimic a polymorphic pretransition from a spherical toward a cylindrical micelle structure."
https://openalex.org/W1909751364,"Abstract The mechanism of glucocorticoid-induced internucleosomal DNA cleavage and cytolysis of lymphatic cells is not known. Recent data (Compton, M.M., and Cidlowski, J.A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8288-8292) suggested that in vivo treatment of rat thymocytes with glucocorticoids induces a nucleolytic lysis gene product(s) responsible for lymphocytolysis. In this paper, the possibility that lymphocytolysis may result from glucocorticoid-induced nuclease(s) was examined. Using the rat thymocytes as a model system, we have shown by electrophoretic, enzymatic, and amino acid sequence analysis that the putative glucocorticoid-induced nucleases identified recently by Compton and Cidlowski are in fact H1, H1(0), and core histones, and their gross appearance is not the result of new histone protein synthesis, but a result of the release of histone-containing nucleosomes during chromatin breakdown. Evidence presented here shows that the putative induced nuclease activity is an artifact of the assay system employed. Because our data do not support induction of a glucocorticoid-induced nuclease(s), we examined the possibility that DNA cleavage might be induced by activation of a constitutive endogenous endonuclease. We have shown that it is possible to produce characteristic internucleosomal DNA cleavage of rat thymocytes, merely by incubating intact nuclei from untreated adrenalectomized rat thymocytes with Ca2+ and Mg2+ for a short period of time. However, in glucocorticoid-sensitive human CEM-C7 lymphocytes activation of internucleosomal DNA cleavage was independent of calcium uptake. We conclude that glucocorticoid induction of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation does not necessarily require expression of a new nuclease(s), but is the result of the activation of a constitutive endogenous endonuclease(s). Also, our data suggest that the mechanism which controls activation of internucleosomal DNA cleavage in rat thymocytes differs from that which operates in CEM-C7 lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1505761793,"Abstract cDNA clones were isolated by screening a human thyroid carcinoma lambda gt11 library with immunoglobulins purified from serum of a patient with autoimmune Graves' disease. One clone (ML8) containing a 1.25-kilobase (kb) insert hybridized with a single 2.0-kb poly(A+) mRNA in human thyroid and lymphocytes but not in human brain, liver, kidney, or muscle. In addition, this probe also hybridized with a single 2.0-kb poly(A+) mRNA from a rat thyroid cell line (FRTL-5). An apparently full length 2,074-base pair (bp) human cDNA was obtained and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the 2,074-bp cDNA includes a 5'-noncoding sequence of 17 bp, a 1827-bp open reading frame, and a 222-bp 3'-noncoding sequence. The canonical polyadenylation signal AATAAA is present 18 bp upstream of the poly(A) tail. This cDNA encodes a 69,812-dalton protein with two potential N-linked glycosylation sites and at least one potential membrane spanning domain. Immunoprecipitation of the in vitro translated protein by sera from several patients with Graves' disease argues that the 69,812-dalton protein is an autoantigen."
https://openalex.org/W1625367053,"Abstract A method for the purification of lipid transfer protein (LTP) from human plasma was developed with the aid of succinylated low density lipoprotein-Sepharose affinity column chromatography. The purified LTP exhibited a single main band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, upon isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gel, the preparations consistently showed nine bands with isoelectric points ranging from 4.6 to 5.4. The treatment of LTP with Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase shifted these multiple bands toward higher pH regions due to the release of sialic acid. Extensive treatment with neuraminidase resulted in the appearance of a major band with the isoelectric point of 5.6. The purified LTP was rapidly inactivated upon incubation at 37 degrees C due to the denaturation at the air-water interface. Various factors promoting or preventing this interfacial denaturation were elucidated. When purified LTP was stored at 4 degrees C, plasma neuraminidase co-purified with LTP became activated, resulting in the gradual desialylation of LTP. It seemed that the LTP preparations of apparent homogeneity are associated with a trace amount of an inactive form of plasma neuraminidase. The inclusion of 4 mM 2-mercaptoethanol or 0.2% EDTA in the storage media completely prevented the activation of plasma neuraminidase. These agents, however, did not significantly inhibit the already activated neuraminidase. When LTP was stored at -20 degrees C in very low ionic strength media, such as 0.001% EDTA (pH 7.4) and at high protein concentrations, the loss of the activity was minimal even after prolonged storage."
https://openalex.org/W1510915684,"Abstract Factor XIIIa cross-links plasma fibronectin as it is being assembled into the extracellular matrix of cultured human skin fibroblasts (Barry, E. L. R., and Mosher, D. F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10464-10469). We have further characterized this process. Fibroblasts were metabolically labeled with proline in the presence or absence of ascorbate and Factor XIIIa. Endogenous fibronectin in the extracellular matrix was cross-linked by Factor XIIIa. There was no evidence for cross-linking of collagenous proteins. Fibro-blast cell layers were incubated with iodinated 27-kDa heparin-binding or 70-kDa collagen- and heparin-binding amino-terminal fibronectin fragments. Factor XIIa cross-linked the fragments into high molecular weight aggregates. The amounts of cross-linked fragments reaches a steady state after 1 to 2 h, whereas intact fibronectin continues to be cross-linked for 24 h. When fibroblast cell layers were pulsed with iodinated fibronectin or amino-terminal fragments and Factor XIIIa was included in the chase media, the high molecular weight aggregates were formed in a step-wise manner. The smallest cross-linking steps were to high molecular weight extracellular matrix molecules forming approximately 270-, 300-, and 440-kDa complexes for the 27-kDa fragment, 70-kDa fragment, and intact fibronectin, respectively. When iodinated fibronectin was bound to fibroblast cell layers and chased into the matrix pool in the absence of Factor XIIIa, it could also be cross-linked into high molecular weight complexes when Factor XIIIa was added to the media. These results, therefore, indicate that both cellular and plasma fibronectin and amino-terminal fragments are cross-linked specifically by Factor XIIIa, that the cross-linking is probably to other fibronectin molecules rather than to collagenous proteins, and that both assembling and assembled fibronectin are substrates for Factor XIIIa."
https://openalex.org/W1572006943,"Oligonucleotide-directed site mutagenesis was used to prepare a series of chicken progesterone receptor deletion mutants in an attempt to elucidate structure-function relationships of the receptor. These mutants spanned the entire 659-amino acid coding region of the A form of the receptor. The ability of these mutants to bind progesterone was analyzed following in vitro transcription and translation. Results obtained indicate that a large portion of the protein ranging from amino acid 420 to the extreme carboxyl terminus is necessary to maintain the protein in a conformation which is capable of binding hormone. Following transient cotransfection of mutant receptor proteins into CV-1 cells along with a reporter gene containing an authentic GRE/PRE (PRE-TK-CAT), our results indicated that any deletion throughout the entire molecule results in a decrease in transcriptional activation. Most of these decreases result from an inability of the mutant receptor proteins to bind DNA or hormone. However, two areas of the receptor have been identified which are unrelated to either DNA or hormone binding but markedly affect the ability of the receptor to transactivate target genes."
https://openalex.org/W1529070825,"We have previously shown that a deletion of approximately 3 kilobases in the unique glycophorin C (GPC) gene, which encodes for the human erythrocyte glycophorins C and D, is associated with the Gerbich (Ge) blood group deficiency (Ge-2,-3 and Ge-2,+3 types) (Le van Kim, C., Colin, Y., Blanchard, D., Dahr, W., London, J. & Cartron, J.P. (1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 165, 571-579). We have now isolated and characterized the structure of the GPC gene from the common Ge+2,+3 donors and from a Ge-2,-3 variant (Ge-2,-3 gene). The GPC gene is organized in four exons distributed over 13.5-kilobase pairs (kbp) DNA and contains two directly repeated domains of 3.4 kbp in length which are likely derived from the recent duplication of a unique ancestral domain. Restriction mapping and sequence analysis indicate that a 3.4-kbp deletion within this gene, arising probably by unequal crossing over between the two repeated domains, is responsible for the formation of the Ge-2,-3 gene. The breakpoints of the deletion are located within introns 2 and 3, and therefore exon 3 is removed. The defective gene is transcribed as a mRNA with a continuous open reading frame extending over 300 nucleotides which is translated into an unusual sialoglycoprotein present on Ge-2,-3 red cells. The primary structure of this new glycoprotein has been deduced from nucleotide sequencing. It is proposed in addition, that another 3.4-kb deletion within the GPC gene eliminates exon 2 only by a similar mechanism and generates a defective gene encoding for the abnormal glycoprotein present on Ge-2,+3 erythrocytes. Interestingly, the same deletion which lead to the rare Ge-2,-3 genetic condition, occurred spontaneously and frequently in the cloned GPC gene during the propagation of the recombinant phages in Escherichia coli. From these observations we suggest that the Ge-2,-3 and Ge-2,+3 genes might represent the two allelic forms of a unique ancestral form of the GPC gene, following successive internal duplication and deletion events."
https://openalex.org/W1492373256,"Structural features at the extra adenosine bulge sites in DNA duplexes have been elucidated from an NMR analysis of two-dimensional through space and through bond connectivities in the self-complementary d(C-C-G-G-A-A-T-T-C-A-C-G-G) (CAC 13-mer) and d(C-C-G-A-G-A-A-T-T-C-C-G-G) (GAG 13-mer) duplexes in aqueous solution. These studies establish that the extra adenosine stacks into the helix at all temperatures below the onset of the melting transition in solution, and the results are independent of whether the extra adenosine is flanked by cytidines (CAC 13-mer) or guanosines (GAG 13-mer). The NMR parameters establish that the extra adenosine can be accommodated into the helix with the flanking base pairs adopting a wedge-shaped orientation. The resulting perturbation extends out to the C10-G11 phosphodiester backbone adjacent to the bulge segment in both the CAC 13-mer and GAG 13-mer duplexes."
https://openalex.org/W2147548796,"The effect of oxidant stress on agonist-induced changes in endothelial cell cytosolic free Ca2+ (Ca2+i) was measured using the fluorescent probe, fura-2. Cultured vascular endothelial cells were loaded with fura-2 via the acetoxymethyl ester form, fura-2/AM, before incubation with t-butyl-hydroperoxide (0.4 mM). Bradykinin-stimulated changes in (Ca2+i) were measured in cells exposed to the hydroperoxide for 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min. Incubation of cells with the oxidant initially (within 30 min) diminished the peak rise in (Ca2+i) that occurs after stimulation with bradykinin. Experiments conducted with cells in a Ca2+-free buffer indicated that t-butyl-hydroperoxide inhibited bradykinin-stimulated Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space and had little effect on agonist-induced release of Ca2+ from internal stores. At the later incubation periods (greater than 60 min), basal (Ca2+i) progressively rose and the peak response to bradykinin progressively decreased. After 180 min, the cells appeared unable to maintain steady-state with respect to Ca2+ flux. These alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis occurred before detectable changes in the ability of the cells to exclude trypan blue. These results suggest that oxidant stress alters the change in Ca2+i of vascular endothelial cells following stimulation with vasoactive agents."
https://openalex.org/W1590652959,"Abstract Enantiomeric cycloheptyl- and isopropyl methylphosphonothioates containing uncharged and cationic leaving groups, and 3,3-dimethylbutyl methylphosphonyl thiocholines were synthesized, and their inhibition of acetylcholinesterase from Torpedo examined. Bimolecular inhibition constants spanned 10(1)-10(9) M-1.min-1, equilibrium dissociation constants 10(-3)-10(-7) M, and phosphonylation constants 1-300 min-1. A general but not absolute preference for the SP-enantiomer, in the range 170-4600 for cycloheptyl-, 0.6-150 for isopropyl-, and 30 for 3,3-dimethylbutyl methylphosphonothioates, varied with nature of the alkyl ester (-OR) and thioic leaving groups (-SR') surrounding phosphorus. While the overall bimolecular reaction constant showed no marked dependence on ionic strength of the medium, the microscopic kp and KD for the RP- but not SP-cycloheptyl methylphosphonyl thiocholine underwent marked reduction with decreases in ionic strength. This result unmasks the interplay between occupation of the active center and productivity of that occupation. These studies reveal that chiral reactions with acetylcholinesterase are dependent more on the nature of the groups surrounding the tetrahedral phosphorus than on the absolute configuration about the phosphorus atom and indicate that the active center comprises partially overlapping subsites that can accommodate the -OR and -SR' groups. The presence of neighboring subsites characterized by different steric, electrostatic, and hydrophobic properties permits a multiplicity of binding orientations, independent of chiral configuration, and which account for the large variation in chiral preference seen among organophosphonates containing different substituents."
https://openalex.org/W1595152081,"An angiotensin II-binding activity has been purified almost 3,000-fold to a nearly homogenous state from the 100,000 x g supernatant fraction of rabbit liver. The responsible protein is apparently monomeric since its molecular weight was estimated to be 75,000 in the native state by glycerol gradient centrifugation and in the reduced, denatured state by gel electrophoresis. The Kd and Bmax values of the purified preparation were 7.2 nM and 15.2 nmol of angiotensin II bound per mg of protein, the latter figure agreeing well with the theoretical value of 13.3. Competition experiments with 125I-angiotensin II and unlabeled peptides revealed that the angiotensin antagonist [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II (saralasin) and the agonist [des-Asp1]angiotensin II (angiotensin III) were more tightly bound than angiotensin II, whereas angiotensin I and the carboxyl-terminal hexapeptide were less avidly bound. The cardiac peptide, atrial natriuretic factor, also competed for binding to the purified preparation but was about 15-fold less effective than angiotensin II. Although the binding activity was purified in the absence of detergent, a requirement for detergent in the binding reaction emerged during the isolation procedure. Binding by the purified protein exhibited an almost complete dependence upon the presence of detergent, p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid and EDTA."
https://openalex.org/W1481576611,"Abstract The UV footprinting technique has been used to detect and map, at single nucleotide resolution, the formation of A conformations within a sea urchin 5S ribosomal RNA gene. Increasing amounts of the dehydrating agent, trifluorethanol, were used to induce the B----A transition. Our measurements argue that the B----A transition is highly sequence-specific. Fourteen different sequences within a fragment of DNA bearing the 5 S gene were found to undergo the B----A transition independently of one another. There is a striking relationship between the midpoint of the B----A transition for each stretch of DNA and its (G+C) content. DNA sequences at the boundary between A and B conformations do not appear to be significantly distorted. A (dAdT)8 tract at the 3' end of the 5 S gene undergoes the B----A transition in two cooperative steps suggesting that for some sequences the B----A transition may actually proceed through the formation of a previously unidentified intermediate. Although the sequence specificity of the B----A transition may be exploited by regulatory proteins when they bind DNA, our measurements argue that binding of the Xenopus laevis transcription factor 111A to 5 S genes does not."
https://openalex.org/W1596023781,"Abstract The dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2)-protein X-kinase subcomplex was resolved to produce an oligomeric transacetylase that was free of protein X and kinase subunits. We investigated the properties of this transacetylase E2 oligomer and of a form of the subcomplex from which only the lipoyl-bearing domain of protein X (XL) was removed. While retaining other catalytic and binding properties of the native subcomplex, the oligomeric transacetylase and the subcomplex lacking the XL domain had greatly reduced capacities both to support the overall reaction of the complex (upon reconstitution with other components) and to bind the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase component. Our results indicate that protein X, in part through its XL domain, contributes to the binding of the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase component and to the overall reaction of the complex."

Here we examine the upstream and downstream regions of such transcription loops by electron microscopy. We demonstrate that a loop starts and ends in tightly packed chromatin; the two anchoring sites are clearly separated from each other in space. The upstream, nontranscribed region consists of a thin, extended, apparently flexible and nucleosome-free fiber corresponding to about 0.5 kb DNA. The downstream, nontranscribed region appears as a 200 nm long nucleofilament loosely coiled into a short, thick chromatin fiber and estimated to contain about 3 kb DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1532212223,"Hepatic lipase is proposed to have a role in steroidogenesis through its involvement in the metabolism of high density lipoproteins. We examined the activity, synthesis, distribution, and uptake of this enzyme and assessed the content of its mRNA in luteinized ovaries. We found that during peak steroidogenesis, ovaries of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin-human chorionic gonadotropin-treated immature rats contained heparin-releasable hepatic lipase-like activity which was neutralized in a dose-dependent manner by purified antibodies to hepatic lipase isolated from post-heparin perfusates of rat livers. Quantitative immunoelectron microscopy revealed that ovarian hepatic lipase occurred along endothelial cells and was 3-fold more abundant in blood vessels of corpora lutea than those of stroma. However, hepatic lipase was not synthesized by the ovary since radiolabeled enzyme was not immunoisolated from the medium of dispersed luteinized granulosa cells incubated with [35S]methionine whereas it was present in the medium of control cells (hepatocytes). Similarly, hepatic lipase mRNA was detectable in liver but not ovaries or kidneys by Northern or slot blot analyses or by the polymerase chain reaction. Finally, 125I-labeled hepatic lipase injected into tail veins was quickly cleared from the systemic circulation, accumulating in liver, ovaries, kidneys, and spleen. Subsequent heparin injection caused rapid reappearance of radioactivity in the bloodstream and a marked decline of radiolabel in liver and ovaries but a modest decrease of that in kidneys and none in spleen. Exogenous 125I-bovine serum albumin also accumulated in all four organs but was not displaced from liver or ovaries by subsequent administration of heparin. Taken together, these data suggest that steroidogenically active ovaries possess but do not synthesize hepatic lipase. Instead, hepatic lipase originating elsewhere, presumably in the liver, is accumulated from the circulation at heparin-sensitive sites in ovarian blood vessels."
https://openalex.org/W1599589896,"A calcium-dependent alpha-1,2-mannosidase involved in the processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides was purified to homogeneity from rabbit liver microsomes. N-terminal amino acid analysis was consistent with the presence of a homogeneous protein. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, under both reducing and nonreducing conditions, revealed a single protein band with an apparent molecular weight of 52,000. Gel filtration and sedimentation analysis under nondenaturing conditions suggested that the purified enzyme is a monomeric protein. The mannosidase is a glycoprotein based on the presence of protein-linked sugar and specific binding of the enzyme to concanavalin A-Sepharose. Purified mannosidase was optimally active between pH 5.0 and 6.0. The enzyme was inactive with p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside and was inhibited by deoxymannojirimycin but not by swainsonine. The enzyme was specifically activated by Ca2+, with half-maximal activation occurring at concentrations of 10 microM or less and was inhibited by Mn2+, Co2+, Ba2+, and Zn2+. Calcium ions protected the enzyme against inactivation by p-chloromercuribenzoate. Rabbit liver mannosidase hydrolyzed alpha-1,2-mannosyl-mannose linkages in a variety of substrates including methyl-2-O-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside (Schutzbach, J. S. (1987) Anal. Biochem. 167, 279-283), ovalbumin glycopeptide IV, and the high mannose chains of thyroglobulin and phytohemagglutinin-P. Approximately 70% of the alpha-1,2-linked mannosyl units in the oligosaccharides of thyroglobulin were accessible to rabbit liver alpha-mannosidase, whereas most of the alpha-1,2-mannosyl units in phytohemagglutinin were resistant to digestion prior to heat denaturation of the plant lectin."
https://openalex.org/W1495164395,"Intravenous administration of 26-hydroxycholesterol to the rabbit with a bile fistula yielded cholic acid in proportions (84 and 86%) not significantly different from that derived from cholesterol. By contrast, the naturally occurring C27 bile acid 3 β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid yielded not more than 8% cholic acid. Thus initial 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol followed by 7-α-hydroxylation can provide sufficient amounts of cholic acid to be considered a quantitatively significant pathway for bile acid synthesis, and in addition it is the only pathway that can be the source of the circulating levels of C24 and C27 monohydroxy bile acids."
https://openalex.org/W1485447649,"During acute phase induction in rats, α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) mRNA is modified by a reduction in poly(A) tail size (Shiels, B. R., Northemann, W., Gehring, M. R., and Fey, G. H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12826–12831). In the studies presented here, we analyzed AGP mRNA induction and poly(A) tail modification in both primary rat hepatocytes and in the rat hepatoma cell line HTC. Poly(A) tail shortening occurred during stimulation by both glucocorticoids and hepatocyte stimulating factor. Induction of AGP by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone resulted in an approximately 50-fold increase in transcription by 4 h, which was followed by an equally rapid decrease. The large mRNA pool that resulted from this early burst of transcription was very stable, having a half-life of well over 24 h, and the individual molecules in this pool had an average poly(A) tail length of 200–250 bases. This stable pool of AGP mRNAs was then deadenylated to form a pool with an average tail length of 20–50 bases; the time course of this shortening followed that seen in the liver. Ongoing RNA synthesis, but not ongoing protein synthesis, was required for shortening of the tail. In contrast to the conclusion of Shiels et al. (1987), our data indicate that deadenylation occurs in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. Our data also suggest that shortening of AGP mRNA represents a specific example of the general deadenylation seen in earlier studies of total cellular RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1485368483,"Abstract Cytochrome P-450 is known to catalyze the following oxygen transfer reaction: RH + PhIO----ROH + PhI where RH represents a variety of hydroxylatable substrates and PhIO a variety of iodosobenzene derivatives that serve as oxygen donors, and neither molecular oxygen nor an external electron donor is required. To determine whether the cytochrome functions in such reactions by a peroxidase-type mechanism, the kinetics of its interaction with a variety of substituted iodosobenzenes and iodobenzene diacetates have been determined by stopped flow spectrophotometry. The reaction of phenobarbital-induced rabbit liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 form 2 with iodosobenzenes or iodobenzene diacetates leads to the reversible formation of three spectral intermediates, termed E, F, and G. Complex E is characterized by a type I difference spectrum, representing the iodosobenzene-dependent partial shift of the low spin hexacoordinate form of the ferric enzyme to the high spin pentacoordinate form, F represents a transient intermediate whose spectrum cannot be determined for kinetic reasons, and G represents a blue-shifted intermediate with an absorption maximum at about 393 nm in the absolute spectrum. The striking and principal feature of these observations is that the spectrum of Complex G does not vary with structural differences in the iodosobenzene derivatives, in contrast to the transient species observed in previous studies in this laboratory in the reaction between cytochrome P-450 form 2 and aromatic peroxy compounds. Complex G exhibits the spectral properties one might anticipate for an iron-oxo intermediate containing only one oxygen atom derived from the starting iodosobenzene."
https://openalex.org/W1533696243,"Abstract The life cycle transformation of the protozoan parasite Leishmania from promastigote to amastigote is accompanied by changes in the level of expression of a number of proteins whose function may be necessary for parasite survival in the sandfly vector or mammalian host. To genetically characterize these proteins, we have cloned and characterized cDNA sequences that vary in abundance during the life cycle of Leishmania major. One sequence (P100/11E) encodes a poly(A+) RNA whose abundance is markedly elevated in promastigotes of L. major. The DNA sequence of the P100/11E cDNA predicts an acidic polypeptide of Mr = 32,000 which shows 40-46% similarity to the superfamily of reductase proteins including 2,5-diketo-D-gluconic acid reductase, aldose reductase, aldehyde reductase, and rho-crystallin. The P100/11E sequence of L. major contains the IPKS motif located at the active site of both aldose and aldehyde reductases. The P100/11H sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified polypeptide was used to raise rabbit antisera which detect a protein of Mr = 35,000 in promastigotes of L. major. These results provide direct genetic evidence that L. major expresses a sequence homologous to the reductase superfamily as a developmentally regulated gene product in promastigotes."
https://openalex.org/W1932000730,"This paper examines the chiral nature of the covalent conjugates formed upon reaction of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) with enantiomeric cycloheptyl, isopropyl, and 3,3-dimethylbutyl methylphosphonyl thiocholines. With the exception of the conjugate formed from reaction of AchE with RP-cycloheptyl methylphosphonyl thiocholine, all enantiomeric conjugates underwent oxime reactivation at rates that were within 2-3-fold of each other. Oxime reactivation was, therefore, independent of both initial configuration about phosphorus and the alkyl phosphonyl ester (-OR) moiety. Aging of the enantiomeric cyclopheptyl and isopropyl methylphosphonyl conjugates occurred exclusively for the conjugate formed from the SP-enantiomer and therefore displayed an absolute dependence on the initial configuration of the methylphosphonyl group. Equilibrium titrations with decidium, a fluorescent bisquaternary competitive inhibitor of AchE, provided an index of aging and enantiomeric configuration of the conjugates independent of enzyme activity. Decidium association with the enantiomeric conjugates (prior to aging) showed no marked dependence on the initial configuration about phosphorus but was measurably dependent on nature of the -OR moiety. These results are interpreted with respect to symmetry and nonrigidity of the organophosphonyl conjugates and are consistent with formation of final methylphosphonyl conjugates that are enantiomerically pure and of opposite configuration. These studies indicate that the active center of AchE comprises at least two kinetically distinct environments separate from the esteratic region but located within 5 A of the nucleophilic serine and differing in dipolar characteristics that promote charge separation and general acid catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1604174036,A cysteine has been introduced into the hydrophobic binding pocket of staphylococcal nuclease via oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The L89C mutation does not significantly alter the catalytic activity or specificity of the nuclease yet provides a metal-dependent switch for regulating enzymatic activity. The L89C mutant can be inactivated by addition of mercuric or cupric salts and subsequently reactivated by addition of chelating agents. This work may provide a general strategy for regulating the catalytic activity of other enzymes or the binding affinity of proteins to DNA or other proteins.
https://openalex.org/W1493670480,"Abstract The protozoa Leishmania undergo morphological and biochemical transformation from the promastigote to the amastigote form during their life cycle. To characterize this transformation process, we constructed a cDNA library for the promastigote stage of Leishmania major and used differential cDNA hybridization to identify cDNA sequences expressed at different abundance in promastigotes or amastigotes of L. major. P100/11E is a single copy gene whose 1600-nucleotide mRNA is enriched in promastigotes. P101/10 is a repeated gene whose 3300-nucleotide transcript is enriched in amastigotes. These developmentally regulated genes are not linked in the genome of L. major and are located on separate chromosome bands. The abundance of the P101/10 transcript increases severalfold during the transformation process at 37 degrees C in vitro and is thermally induced within 3 h after transfer of promastigotes from 27 to 37 degrees C. Examination of beta-tubulin gene expression showed that the relative abundance of the 3400-nucleotide beta-tubulin RNA is decreased at 37 degrees C in vitro. Our results indicate that the expression of two developmentally regulated genes of L. major is controlled at the level of mRNA abundance and provide direct evidence that thermal induction plays a general role in regulating gene expression in Leishmania."
https://openalex.org/W1513924780,"Abstract An in situ and in vivo surface coil 13C NMR study was performed to study hepatic glycogen synthesis from [3-13C]alanine and [1-13C]glucose administered by intraduodenal infusion in 18-h fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats. Combined, equimolar amounts of alanine and glucose were given. Hepatic appearance and disappearance of substrate and concurrent glycogen synthesis was followed over 150 min, with 5-min time resolution. Active glycogen synthesis from glucose via the direct (glucose----glycogen) and indirect (glucose----lactate----glycogen) pathways and from alanine via gluconeogenesis was observed. The indirect pathway of glycogen synthesis from [1-13C]glucose accounted for 30% (+/- 6 S.E.) of total glycogen formed from labeled glucose. This estimate does not take into account dilution of label in the hepatic oxaloacetate pool and is, therefore, somewhat uncertain. Hepatic levels of [3-13C]alanine achieved were significantly lower than levels of [1-13C]glucose in the liver, and the period of active glycogen synthesis from [3-13C]alanine was longer than from glucose. However, the overall pseudo-first-order rate constant during the period of active glycogen synthesis from [3-13C]alanine (0.075 min-1 +/- 0.026 S.E.) was almost 3 times that from [1-13C]glucose via the direct pathway (0.025 min-1 +/- 0.005 S.E.). The most likely reason for the small rate constant governing direct glycogen formation from duodenally administered glucose compared to that from duodenally administered alanine is a low level of glucose phosphorylating capacity in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1531938753,"Import of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase into the chloroplast has been proposed to involve two proteolytic cleavages which convert the 20-kDa precursor (pSSU) into the mature 14-kDa subunit (SSU) via an 18-kDa intermediate. A deletion mutant (PSd48/57) of pSSU which lacks 10 amino acids in a conserved region in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the transit peptide is converted into a series of 16-18-kDa polypeptides in addition to the mature 14-kDa SSU when imported into isolated pea chloroplasts. We examined import and processing of this mutant pSSU to determine whether the 16-18-kDa SSUs undergo further maturation in the chloroplast stroma to yield 14-kDa SSU. The ratio of incorrectly processed to 14-kDa SSU is stable up to 60 min following import. This indicates that processing of PSd48/57 involves a single proteolytic cleavage which occurs during or immediately following transit across the chloroplast envelope. The carboxyl-terminal portion of the transit peptide confers either sequence specificity for the processing protease or provides a three-dimensional structure necessary for consistent cleavage at the mature amino terminus of SSU. Incorrectly processed SSUs were incorporated into the holoenzyme demonstrating that removal of the entire transit sequence is not necessary for assembly of the holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1535792826,"Pi uptake by purified bovine cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles was stimulated by an inwardly directed Na+ gradient, but not by such gradients of K+, Rb+, Li+, and choline. When Na+ was present both inside and outside the vesicles, or when Na+ gradient was dissipated by monensin, the Na+-dependent Pi uptake increased with time, reached a peak, and then declined approaching a steady state. The initial rate of Na+-dependent Pi uptake was a saturable function of Pi concentration (Km = 0.5 mM). These findings indicate the existence of a Na+,Pi-cotransporter in the sarcolemma. The Na+-activation curve of the Pi uptake exhibited positive cooperativity, suggesting the requirement for multiple Na+ binding to the functional unit of the carrier. The initial rate of Na+-dependent Pi uptake decreased as extra-vesicular pH increased in the range of 5.5-8.7. The uptake rate increased under conditions that are known or expected to generate an inside-negative membrane potential, indicating that Pi uptake is accompanied by the uptake of positive charge. These results suggest the electrogenic cotransports of two Na+ and one H2PO4-. We conclude that this cotransporter catalyzes the secondary active transport of Pi across the cardiac plasma membrane and regulates myocardial energy metabolism. We also suggest that the cotransporter may control intracellular Na+ and thus be involved in the regulation of trans-sarcolemmal Ca2+ movement and cardiac contractility."

The energization effect was observed in the presence of 0.5-0.7 mM cumene hydroperoxide or 2.0-2.5 mM tert-butyl hydroperoxide. This energization of mitochondria and activation of oxidative phosphorylation by organic hydroperoxides required the presence of ADP in the mitochondrial matrix and does not depend upon the method of deenergization of the mitochondria.
