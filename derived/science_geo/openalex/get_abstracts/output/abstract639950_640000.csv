https://openalex.org/W2973356406,"Long-distance RNA transport enables local protein synthesis at metabolically-active sites distant from the nucleus. This process ensures an appropriate spatial organization of proteins, vital to polarized cells such as neurons. Here, we present a mechanism for RNA transport in which RNA granules ""hitchhike"" on moving lysosomes. In vitro biophysical modeling, live-cell microscopy, and unbiased proximity labeling proteomics reveal that annexin A11 (ANXA11), an RNA granule-associated phosphoinositide-binding protein, acts as a molecular tether between RNA granules and lysosomes. ANXA11 possesses an N-terminal low complexity domain, facilitating its phase separation into membraneless RNA granules, and a C-terminal membrane binding domain, enabling interactions with lysosomes. RNA granule transport requires ANXA11, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated mutations in ANXA11 impair RNA granule transport by disrupting their interactions with lysosomes. Thus, ANXA11 mediates neuronal RNA transport by tethering RNA granules to actively-transported lysosomes, performing a critical cellular function that is disrupted in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2974815351,"Focal adhesions (FAs) are protein machineries essential for cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Talin is an integrin-activating and tension-sensing FA component directly connecting integrins in the plasma membrane with the actomyosin cytoskeleton. To understand how talin function is regulated, we determined a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of full-length talin1 revealing a two-way mode of autoinhibition. The actin-binding rod domains fold into a 15-nm globular arrangement that is interlocked by the integrin-binding FERM head. In turn, the rod domains R9 and R12 shield access of the FERM domain to integrin and the phospholipid PIP2 at the membrane. This mechanism likely ensures synchronous inhibition of integrin, membrane, and cytoskeleton binding. We also demonstrate that compacted talin1 reversibly unfolds to an ∼60-nm string-like conformation, revealing interaction sites for vinculin and actin. Our data explain how fast switching between active and inactive conformations of talin could regulate FA turnover, a process critical for cell adhesion and signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2974257160,"The adverse effects of heat on plant yield strongly depend on its duration and the phenological stage of the crops when the heat occurs. To clarify the effects of these two aspects of heat stress, systematic research was conducted under controlled conditions on 101 wheat cultivars of various geographic origin. Different durations of heat stress (5, 10 and 15 days) were applied starting from three developmental stages (ZD49: booting stage, ZD59: heading, ZD72: 6th day after heading). Various morphological, yield-related traits and physiological parameters were measured to determine the stress response patterns of the wheat genotypes under combinations of the duration and the timing of heat stress. Phenological timing significantly influenced the thousand-kernel weight and reproductive tiller number. The duration of heat stress was the most significant component in determining both seed number and seed weight, as well as the grain yield consequently, explaining 51.6% of its phenotypic variance. Irrespective of the developmental phase, the yield-related traits gradually deteriorated over time, and even a 5-day heat stress was sufficient to cause significant reductions. ZD59 was significantly more sensitive to heat than either ZD49 or ZD72. The photosynthetic activity of the flag leaf was mostly determined by heat stress duration. No significant associations were noted between physiological parameters and heat stress response as measured by grain yield. Significant differences were observed between the wheat genotypes in heat stress responses, which varied greatly with developmental phase. Based on the grain yield across developmental phases and heat stress treatments, eight major response groups of wheat genotypes could be identified, and among them, three clusters were the most heat-tolerant. These cultivars are currently included in crossing schemes, partially for the identification of the genetic determinants of heat stress response and partially for the development of new wheat varieties with better heat tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2974890644,"Genes are often transcribed by multiple RNA polymerases (RNAPs) at densities that can vary widely across genes and environmental conditions. Here, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence for a built-in mechanism by which co-transcribing RNAPs display either collaborative or antagonistic dynamics over long distances (>2 kb) through transcription-induced DNA supercoiling. In Escherichia coli, when the promoter is active, co-transcribing RNAPs translocate faster than a single RNAP, but their average speed is not altered by large variations in promoter strength and thus RNAP density. Environmentally induced promoter repression reduces the elongation efficiency of already-loaded RNAPs, causing premature termination and quick synthesis arrest of no-longer-needed proteins. This negative effect appears independent of RNAP convoy formation and is abrogated by topoisomerase I activity. Antagonistic dynamics can also occur between RNAPs from divergently transcribed gene pairs. Our findings may be broadly applicable given that transcription on topologically constrained DNA is the norm across organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2973246081,"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that severely affects patients physiologically and psychologically. The pathogenesis involving communication between psoriatic keratinocytes and infiltrated immune cells such as neutrophils remains unclear. Exosomes are emerging mediators of intercellular communication. Herein we aim to investigate the release and function of psoriatic keratinocyte exosomes, which have not been illustrated to any extent. We first isolated exosomes from both healthy and psoriasis-like keratinocytes treated with psoriatic cytokine cocktail. These exosomes were observed to be endocytosed by neutrophils. Unlike non-cytokine-treated keratinocyte exosomes, cytokine-treated keratinocyte exosomes significantly induced NETosis (the process by which neutrophils produce and release neutrophil extracellular traps) and the expressions of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α in neutrophils. Proteomic analysis showed that cytokine-treated keratinocyte exosomes exhibited a specific protein profile with proteins enriched in immune-related pathways. We then confirmed that NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling pathways were activated in neutrophils stimulated by cytokine-treated keratinocyte exosomes and were responsible for the expressions of proinflammatory factors mentioned above. Finally, we verified in vivo that cytokine-treated keratinocyte exosomes participated in the skin lesion development of imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse model. Collectively, we reveal that the release of exosomes works as a way of keratinocyte-neutrophil communication, indicating that keratinocyte exosomes, with their specific cargoes, are therapeutic candidates for psoriasis.-Jiang, M., Fang, H., Shao, S., Dang, E., Zhang, J., Qiao, P., Yang, A., Wang, G. Keratinocyte exosomes activate neutrophils and enhance skin inflammation in psoriasis."
https://openalex.org/W2973630818,"The three-dimensional organization of chromosomes can have a profound impact on their replication and expression. The chromosomes of higher eukaryotes possess discrete compartments that are characterized by differing transcriptional activities. Contrastingly, most bacterial chromosomes have simpler organization with local domains, the boundaries of which are influenced by gene expression. Numerous studies have revealed that the higher-order architectures of bacterial and eukaryotic chromosomes are dependent on the actions of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) superfamily protein complexes, in particular, the near-universal condensin complex. Intriguingly, however, many archaea, including members of the genus Sulfolobus do not encode canonical condensin. We describe chromosome conformation capture experiments on Sulfolobus species. These reveal the presence of distinct domains along Sulfolobus chromosomes that undergo discrete and specific higher-order interactions, thus defining two compartment types. We observe causal linkages between compartment identity, gene expression, and binding of a hitherto uncharacterized SMC superfamily protein that we term ""coalescin."""
https://openalex.org/W2974790801,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and tauopathies, tau aggregation accompanies progressive neurodegeneration. Aggregated tau appears to spread between adjacent neurons and adjacent brain regions by prion-like seeding. Hence, inhibitors of this seeding offer a possible route to managing tauopathies. Here, we report the 1.0 Å resolution micro-electron diffraction structure of an aggregation-prone segment of tau with the sequence SVQIVY, present in the cores of patient-derived fibrils from AD and tauopathies. This structure illuminates how distinct interfaces of the parent segment, containing the sequence VQIVYK, foster the formation of distinct structures. Peptide-based fibril-capping inhibitors designed to target the two VQIVYK interfaces blocked proteopathic seeding by patient-derived fibrils. These VQIVYK inhibitors add to a panel of tau-capping inhibitors that targets specific polymorphs of recombinant and patient-derived tau fibrils. Inhibition of seeding initiated by brain tissue extracts differed among donors with different tauopathies, suggesting that particular fibril polymorphs of tau are associated with certain tauopathies. Donors with progressive supranuclear palsy exhibited more variation in inhibitor sensitivity, suggesting that fibrils from these donors were more polymorphic and potentially vary within individual donor brains. Our results suggest that a subset of inhibitors from our panel could be specific for particular disease-associated polymorphs, whereas inhibitors that blocked seeding by extracts from all of the tauopathies tested could be used to broadly inhibit seeding by multiple disease-specific tau polymorphs. Moreover, we show that tau-capping inhibitors can be transiently expressed in HEK293 tau biosensor cells, indicating that nucleic acid-based vectors can be used for inhibitor delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2973539798,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide. While it has been suggested to cause nervous impairment, its neurophysiological basis remains unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study is to unravel the effects of NASH, through the interrelationship of liver, gut microbiota, and nervous system, on the brain and human behavior. To this end, 40 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a control group that received normal chow and a NASH group that received a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet. Our results show that 14 weeks of the high-fat, high-cholesterol diet induced clinical conditions such as NASH, including steatosis and increased levels of ammonia. Rats in the NASH group also demonstrated evidence of gut dysbiosis and decreased levels of short-chain fatty acids in the gut. This may explain the deficits in cognitive ability observed in the NASH group, including their depressive-like behavior and short-term memory impairment characterized in part by deficits in social recognition and prefrontal cortex-dependent spatial working memory. We also reported the impact of this NASH-like condition on metabolic and functional processes. Brain tissue demonstrated lower levels of metabolic brain activity in the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, and mammillary bodies, accompanied by a decrease in dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum and a decrease in noradrenalin in the striatum. In this article, we emphasize the important role of ammonia and gut-derived bacterial toxins in liver-gut-brain neurodegeneration and discuss the metabolic and functional brain regional deficits and behavioral impairments in NASH."
https://openalex.org/W2974520919,"Social isolation is a particular problem among older people and social participation may reduce future isolation. However, it is unclear which types of activities and which level of participation are effective. This study examines the relationship between social participation and isolation among Japanese older people by employing a 3-year longitudinal study.A mail survey was sent to 3,518 community-dwelling older people in an urban area in 2014 (baseline: BL). We then conducted follow-up mail survey on respondents who were non-isolated at BL in 2017 (follow-up: FL), with isolation being defined as being in contact with others less than once a week. An analysis was carried out on 1,070 subjects (398 men and 672 women). Social participation is defined by participation in group activities (community, senior club, hobbies, sports, volunteering, politics, industry, and religion). A logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between the types of social participation and the number of organization types at BL, and isolation at FL.At FL, 75 men (18.8%) and 59 women (8.8%) were considered to be isolated. Among the men, participation in a hobby group and sports group both significantly reduced the degree of isolation. Moreover, participation in two organizations and three or more organizations significantly lowered the risk of isolation when compared to non-participants. Among women, there were no significant associations among particular types of social activities and isolation. On the other hand, participation in one organization and three or more organizations significantly reduced their isolation when compared to non-participants. There was a significant linear trend between the number of types of organizations and isolation, regardless of gender.Participation in social activities reduces future isolation in older people. Encouraging participation in social activities could help reduce negative health outcomes associated with social isolation later in life."
https://openalex.org/W2973423740,"Aeromonas bacteria can cause an infection characterized by septicemia and is one of the most common pathogens in tropical fish. This disease is responsible for high morbidity and mortality rates, causing considerable losses in aquaculture. Thus, the understanding of its pathophysiology is crucial to develop control strategies of this bacterial infection in farmed fish. This study aimed to characterize early pathological aspects of acute sepsis in pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus) experimentally infected with Aeromonas hydrophila. A total of 160 juvenile pacus were inoculated intraperitoneally with A. hydrophila (1.78 x 109 CFU/mL) and at 0 (control), 1, 3, 6, and 9 hours post-inoculation (hpi), animals were anesthetized and samples were collected for microbiological, light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyzes. The results showed the occurrence of hemodynamic alterations, such as hemorrhage and congestion, which were observed mainly after 6 and 9 hpi. It was possible to re-isolate Aeromonas at all sampling times except in control group. However, just after 9 hpi it was possible to find the bacteria in all fish and tissues. Light microscopy analyses revealed a degenerative process, necrosis and vascular damage mainly at 6 and 9 hpi. According to the ultrastructural examination, areas of cellular death were identified in all examined tissues, especially at 6 and 9 hpi. However, the most severe, related to necrosis, were observed after 6 and 9 hpi. The findings suggested that this bacterium spreads in the first hpi through the fish organs, mainly affecting spleen, liver and kidney, causing irreversible lesions at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W2973860373,"Alternatively-spliced hypervariable immunoglobulin domain-encoding molecules, called Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam), have been widely detected as components of the arthropod immune system. Although its ability to specifically bind pathogens and enable phagocytosis of bacteria has been elucidated, the signal transduction mechanisms or effectors that activate post-Dscam-binding pathogens remain poorly characterized. Here, we reveal the alternative splicing exons of Dscam's cytoplasmic tail and its isoforms in the hemocytes of crab (Eriocheir sinensis), showing that the expression of Dscam was acutely induced after an immune challenge, which suggested its functioning for innate immunity. Significantly decreased expression levels of antimicrobial molecular peptides (AMPs) were detected in Dscam-silenced crab hemocytes in vitro, which coincided with their vulnerability to infection by Staphylococcus aureus and higher bacterial concentrations occurring in Dscam-silenced crabs in vivo Further experimental investigation demonstrated that Dscam-regulated AMP expression via the Src homology (SH)3-binding domain in the first constant exon translated protein of the cytoplasmic tail bound with the SH3 domain of the Dock, an SH3/SH2 adaptor protein required for axon guidance. Dock promoted extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation via indirect binding and then regulated dorsal phosphorylation and translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, subsequently promoting AMP expression for the effective removal of bacteria. To the best of our knowledge, this comprehensive study is the first to highlight the critical role of the alternatively-spliced Dscam cytoplasmic tail in antimicrobial control activity. It also suggests possible cross-talk occurring between Dscam and other pattern recognition receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2974618200,"Immune responses have been mostly studied at a specific time in anuran species. However, time-changes related to immunomodulation associated with glucocorticoid (GC) alterations following stressors and GC treatment are complex. The present study describes time-related changes in immune response and corticosterone (CORT) plasma levels following restraint challenge, short, mid and long-term captivity, and CORT exogenous administration by transdermal application (TA) in Rhinella ornata toads. We observed increased neutrophil: lymphocyte ratios after restraint challenge and CORT TA, without changes following short and mid-term captivity. Plasma bacterial killing ability was sustained in all treatments, except long-term captivity, with decreased values after 90 days under such conditions. Phagocytic activity of peritoneal cells increased after mid-term captivity, and the phytohemagglutinin swelling response was impaired in those animals treated with CORT TA for 20 consecutive days. Plasma CORT levels increased or were sustained after restraint challenge (depending on initial values), decreased following mid and long-term captivity (for those animals showing high CORT in the field) and increased after 20 days of CORT TA. By performing assessments of time-changes in immune processes and CORT plasma levels in R. ornata, we demonstrate immuno-enhancing effects following restraint, short and mid-term stressors, while long-term stressors and CORT TA promoted immunosuppression in these toads."
https://openalex.org/W2974443042,"One of the trends in today’s tourism sector is the development of environmentally-friendly tourism activities which rely on natural resources of cultural heritage and on biodiversity. This is definitely the case for agritourism, a form of rural tourism. The purpose of this paper is to identify the development aspects of Polish agritourism with particular emphasis on natural and cultural attractiveness. To demonstrate the relationship between agritourism activities of Polish farms and the cultural and natural attractiveness, the Hellwig’s synthetic development indicator was used. As shown by research, the cultural and natural attractiveness of a destination is an important exogenous development factor. Another finding was that the intensified efforts undertaken by the farmers to access EU funds were not focused on areas with valuable natural or cultural resources and an untapped agritourism potential; instead, they were oriented at regions dominated by semi-subsistence or family farms. For a large part of farmers, the new form of support is about to become a source of additional incomes."
https://openalex.org/W2973552704,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women in Ethiopia with increasing burden, and chemotherapy treatment produces a detrimental effect on individual wellbeing. Since last few years quality of life has been the primary goal of cancer treatment, yet little research has been conducted on quality of life of breast cancer patients under chemotherapy.To determine the quality of life and associated factors among patients with breast cancer under chemotherapy at Tikur Anbessa specialized hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted on 404 patients with breast cancer, who took at least one cycle of chemotherapy treatment using face to face interview at oncology unit of Tikur Anbessa specialized hospital day care center from February to April 2018. The validated Amharic version of European organization for research and treatment of cancer core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and quality of life questionnaire specific to breast (QLQ-BR23) was used to measure health related quality of life. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used. For the purpose of interpretation quality of life score was dichotomized in to two using the calculated mean score, which is 53 as a cutoff point, then, bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression was used to describe association between dependent and independent variables. Hence, patients who score above 53 for quality of life were considered to have good quality of life.Of the total sample, overall response rate was 99.77%. The average quality of life score of patients with breast cancer under chemotherapy treatment was 52.98 (SD = 25.61). Majority of patients had scored poor in emotional functioning, sexual functioning, and financial difficulties. Educational status of college and above, being divorced, higher household income, higher scores of physical and social functioning were associated with significantly improved (better) quality of life. Lower scores of fatigue, insomnia, financial difficulties and systemic therapy side effects all were associated with better scores of quality of life of breast cancer patients. Whereas, patients receiving < = 2 cycles of chemotherapy had significantly lower scores of quality of life.Quality of life of breast cancer patients under chemotherapy treatment is poor in comparison with the reference data and international findings. Therefore, quality of life assessment should be incorporated in patient's treatment protocol. And financial aids may significantly improve the quality of life of breast cancer patients under chemotherapy treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2974465514,"Macrophages (Mφs) can be used as a part of cell-based cancer immunotherapy. However, they may be hampered by a failure to effectively and stably regulate their polarization state to enhance their tumoricidal effects. In this work, mechanical stretch (MS), as a biology-free modulatory method, was shown to enhance M1 polarization and tumoricidal effects. By using an in vitro Flexcell Tension system, we found that murine Mφ RAW264.7 cells showed higher M1 polarization-related mRNA expression and cytokine release after MS. Further molecular analyses found that focal adhesion kinase and NF-κB activation occurred in the MS-induced M1 polarization. Coculture of MS-preconditioned Mφ with B16F10 skin melanoma cells in vitro showed that the proliferation of B16F10 cells decreased, whereas caspase-3-induced apoptosis increased. Importantly, the injection of MS-preconditioned Mφ into murine skin melanomas in vivo impeded tumor growth; lesions were characterized by increased amounts of M1 Mφ, decreased tumor cell proliferation, and increased tumor cell apoptosis in the tumor microenvironment. Together, our results suggest that MS could be used as a simple preconditioning approach to prepare tumoricidal M1 Mφ for cancer immunotherapy.-Shan, S., Fang, B., Zhang, Y., Wang, C., Zhou, J., Niu, C., Gao, Y., Zhao, D., He, J., Wang, J., Zhang, X., Li, Q.

https://openalex.org/W2974515708,"Background Little is known about the impact of different types of chronic diseases on older adults’ out-of-pocket healthcare spending and whether certain diseases trigger higher spending needs than others. Methods We use data from the 2014 Health and Retirement Study representing a weighted population of 35,939,270 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65+. Generalized linear models are applied to estimate the effect of different chronic diseases on total out-of-pocket expenditure, adjusted for demographics, socio-economic status, physical health, and other factors. We also decompose total spending by expenditure categories (inpatient, non-inpatient, and prescription drug spending). Sensitivity analysis is performed using a younger sample of older adults aged 50–64. Results Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and cancer, induce significantly higher adjusted out-of-pocket spending among older adults than other conditions. These results hold regardless how the spending differences are assessed (absolute or percentage terms). For Medicare beneficiaries, cardiovascular disease is associated with an excess out-of-pocket spending of $317 per year, followed by diabetes ($237), hypertension ($150), and cancer ($144). Prescription drug spending is singularly the most important driver of additional expenses for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension, while non-inpatient services spending accounts for the bulk of increased spending among those with cancer. Conclusions Our finding that major noncommunicable diseases impact individuals’ out-of-pocket medical spending differentially–and that service drivers of increased spending may be heterogeneous across disease types–suggest that health professionals and policymakers should recognize that certain chronic diseases exert greater financial toll on the elderly. Interventions to promote more cost efficient healthcare services and consumer choices can help older adults better cope with these expensive long-lasting conditions and reduce the overall burden of noncommunicable diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2973251109,"Pigs are anatomically, genetically and physiologically comparable to humans and represent a natural host for influenza A virus (IAV) infections. Thus, pigs may represent a relevant biomedical model for human IAV infections. We set out to investigate the systemic as well as the local immune response in pigs upon two subsequent intranasal infections with IAV H1N1pdm09. We detected decreasing numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes after the first infection. The simultaneous increase in the frequencies of proliferating cells correlated with an increase in infiltrating leukocytes in the lung. Enhanced perforin expression in αβ and γδ T cells in the respiratory tract indicated a cytotoxic T cell response restricted to the route of virus entry such as the nose, the lung and the bronchoalveolar lavage. Simultaneously, increasing frequencies of CD8αα expressing αβ T cells were observed rapidly after the first infection, which may have inhibited uncontrolled inflammation in the respiratory tract. Taking together, the results of this study demonstrate that experimental IAV infection in pigs mimics major characteristics of human seasonal IAV infections."

However, not everyone exposed to mild traumatic brain injury experiences these comorbidities and it is unclear what factors contribute to this variability. The objective of this study was to identify comorbidity phenotypes among Post-9/11 deployed Veterans with no or mild traumatic brain injury and examine the association of comorbidity phenotypes with adverse outcomes. We found that Veterans with mild traumatic brain injury (n = 93,003) and no brain injury (n = 434,378) were mean age of 32.0 (SD 9.21) on entering Department of Veterans Health Administration care, were predominantly Caucasian non-Hispanic (64.69%), and served in the Army (61.31%). Latent class analysis revealed five phenotypes in each subcohort; Moderately Healthy and Mental Health phenotypes were common to both. The Healthy phenotype was found only in no brain injury. Unique phenotypes in mild traumatic brain injury included Moderately Healthy+Decline, Polytrauma, and Polytrauma+Improvement. There was substantial variation in adverse outcomes. The Polytrauma+Improvement phenotype had the lowest likelihood of adverse outcomes. There were no differences between Moderately Healthy+Decline and Polytrauma phenotypes. Phenotypes of comorbidity vary significantly by traumatic brain injury status including divergence in phenotypes (and outcomes) over time in the mild traumatic brain injury subcohort. Understanding risk factors for the divergence between Polytrauma vs. Polytrauma+Improvement and Moderately Healthy vs. Moderately Healthy+Decline, will improve our ability to proactively mitigate risk, better understand the early patterns of comorbidity that are associated with neurodegenerative sequelae following mild traumatic brain injury, and plan more patient-centered care."
https://openalex.org/W2973316193,"Many disease resistance genes that have been transferred from wild relatives to cultivated wheat have played a significant role in wheat production worldwide. Ae. umbellulata is one of the species within the genus Aegilops that have been successfully used as sources of resistance genes to leaf rust, stem rust and powdery mildew. The objectives of the current work was to validate the map position of a major QTL that confers resistance to the stem rust pathogen races Ug99 (TTKSK) and TTTTF with an independent bi-parental mapping population and to refine the QTL region with a bulk segregant analysis approach. Two F2 bi-parental mapping populations were developed from stem rust resistant Ae. umbellulata accessions (PI 298905 and PI 5422375) and stem rust susceptible accessions (PI 542369 and PI 554395). Firstly, one of the two populations was used to map the chromosome location of the resistance gene. Later on, the 2nd population was used to validate the chromosome location in combination with a bulk segregant analysis approach. For the bulk segregant analysis, RNA was extracted from a bulk of leaf tissues of 12 homozygous resistant F3 families, and a separate bulk of 11 susceptible homozygous F3 families derived from the PI 5422375 and PI 554395 cross. The RNA samples of the two bulks and the two parents were sequenced for SNPs identification. Stem rust resistance QTL was validated on chromosome 2U of Ae. umbellulata in the same region in both populations. With bulk segregant analysis, the QTL position was delimited within 3.2 Mbp. Although there were a large number of genes in the orthologous region of the detected QTL on chromosome 2D of Ae. tauschii, we detected only two Ae. umbellulata NLR genes which can be considered as a potential candidate genes."
https://openalex.org/W2973754109,"Previous studies suggest theory of mind (ToM) ability declines with age. However, prior tasks not only required ToM competence but also imposed high executive function (EF) demands, so decline in ToM ability could be caused by deterioration in ToM competence, EF, or both. It was predicted that if the elderly have intact ToM competence but compromised EF, then they should perform similarly to younger adults when using ToM tasks that lower executive demands, such as spontaneous-response tasks. Results showed that on tasks with reduced demands, older adults tracked belief to the same extent as younger adults, despite their declining EF. The findings support a model in which age-related decline in ToM ability is primarily caused by compromised EF, not ToM competence, suggesting that underlying ToM mechanisms are still intact in the elderly. We discuss implications of this work for competence-performance issues in ToM processing and the underlying sources of age-related deterioration of ToM."
https://openalex.org/W2973361769,"In studying the causative mechanisms behind migration and life history, the salmonids–salmon, trout, and charr–are an exemplary taxonomic group, as life history development is known to have a strong genetic component. A double inversion located on chromosome 5 in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is associated with life history development in multiple populations, but the importance of this inversion has not been thoroughly tested in conjunction with other polymorphisms in the genome. To that end, we used a high-density SNP chip to genotype 192 F1 migratory and resident rainbow trout and focused our analyses to determine whether this inversion is important in life history development in a well-studied population of rainbow trout from Southeast Alaska. We identified 4,994 and 436 SNPs–predominantly outside of the inversion region–associated with life history development in the migrant and resident familial lines, respectively. Although F1 samples showed genomic patterns consistent with the double inversion on chromosome 5 (reduced observed and expected heterozygosity and an increase in linkage disequilibrium), we found no statistical association between the inversion and life history development. Progeny produced by crossing resident trout and progeny produced by crossing migrant trout both consisted of a mix of migrant and resident individuals, irrespective of the individuals’ inversion haplotype on chromosome 5. This suggests that although the inversion is present at a low frequency, it is not strongly associated with migration as it is in populations of Oncorhynchus mykiss from lower latitudes."

Nuclear and cytosolic Ca2+ levels can be independently regulated, and nuclear translocation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is one way to locally activate signaling cascades within the nucleus. Nuclear RTKs, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are important for processes such as transcriptional regulation, DNA-damage repair, and cancer therapy resistance. RTKs can hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) within the nucleus, leading to Ca2+ release from the nucleoplasmic reticulum by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis is mediated by phospholipase C (PLC). However, it is unknown which nuclear PLC isoform is triggered by EGFR. Here, using subcellular fractionation, immunoblotting and fluorescence, siRNA-based gene knockdowns, and FRET-based biosensor reporter assays, we investigated the role of PLCδ4 in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced nuclear Ca2+ signaling and downstream events. We found that EGF-induced Ca2+ signals are inhibited when translocation of EGFR is impaired. Nuclear Ca2+ signals also were reduced by selectively buffering inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) within the nucleus. EGF induced hydrolysis of nuclear PI(4,5)P2 by the intranuclear PLCδ4, rather than by PLCγ1. Moreover, protein kinase C, a downstream target of EGF, was active in the nucleus of stimulated cells. Furthermore, PLCδ4 and InsP3 modulated cell cycle progression by regulating the expression of cyclins A and B1.

We integrated multiomics data to construct directed regulatory networks with nodes and edges labeled with chromatin states in human cell lines. We observed extensive association of diverse chromatin states and network motifs. The gene expression analysis showed that diverse chromatin states of coherent type-1 feedforward loop (C1-FFL) and incoherent type-1 feedforward loops (I1-FFL) contributed to the dynamic expression patterns of targets. Notably, diverse chromatin state compositions could help C1- or I1-FFL to control a large number of distinct biological functions in human cell lines, such as four different types of chromatin state compositions cooperating with K562-associated C1-FFLs controlling ""regulation of cytokinesis,"" ""G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle,"" ""DNA recombination,"" and ""telomere maintenance,"" respectively. Remarkably, we identified six chromatin state-marked C1-FFL instances (HCFC1-NFYA-ABL1, THAP1-USF1-BRCA2, ZNF263-USF1-UBA52, MYC-ATF1-UBA52, ELK1-EGR1-CCT4, and YY1-EGR1-INO80C) could act as prognostic biomarkers of acute myelogenous leukemia though influencing cancer-related biological functions, such as cell proliferation, telomere maintenance, and DNA recombination. Our results will provide novel insight for better understanding of chromatin state-mediated gene regulation and facilitate the identification of novel diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers of human cancers."

We examined the association of intensive care with outpatient consultations and quality of life in a population-based sample.Cross-sectional analysis of data from 6,686 participants of the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP), which consists of two independent population-based cohorts. Statistical modeling was done using Poisson regression, negative binomial and generalized linear models for consultations, and a fractional response model for quality of life (EQ-5D-3L index value), with results expressed as prevalence ratios (PR) or percent change (PC). Entropy balancing was used to adjust for observed confounding.ICU treatment in the previous year was reported by 139 of 6,686 (2,1%) participants, and was associated with a higher probability (PR 1.05 [CI:1.03;1.07]), number (PC +58.0% [CI:22.8;103.2]) and costs (PC +64.1% [CI:32.0;103.9]) of annual outpatient consultations, as well as with a higher number of medications (PC +37.8% [CI:17.7;61.5]). Participants with ICU treatment were more likely to visit a specialist (PR 1.13 [CI:1.09; 1.16]), specifically internal medicine (PR 1.67 [CI:1.45;1.92]), surgery (PR 2.42 [CI:1.92;3.05]), psychiatry (PR 2.25 [CI:1.30;3.90]), and orthopedics (PR 1.54 [CI:1.11;2.14]). There was no significant effect regarding general practitioner consultations. ICU treatment was also associated with lower health-related quality of life (EQ-5D index value: PC -13.7% [CI:-27.0;-0.3]). Furthermore, quality of life was inversely associated with outpatient consultations in the previous month, more so for participants with ICU treatment.Our findings suggest that ICU treatment is associated with an increased utilization of outpatient specialist services, higher medication intake, and impaired quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2974400411,"Background and aim Depression is often accompanied by thoughts of self-harm, which are a strong predictor of subsequent suicide attempt and suicide death. Few empirical data are available regarding the temporal correlation between depression symptoms and suicidal ideation. We investigated the anecdotal concern that suicidal ideation may increase during a period of depression improvement. Data Longitudinal Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 is a questionnaire of 9 multiple-choice questions to assess the frequency of depressive symptoms within the previous two weeks. We analyzed a chronic depression treatment population’s electronic health record (EHR) data, containing 610 patients’ longitudinal PHQ-9 scores (62% age 45 and older; 68% female) within 40 weeks. Methods The irregular and sparse EHR data were transformed into continuous trajectories using Gaussian process regression. We first estimated the correlations between the symptoms (total score of the first 8 questions; PHQ-8) and suicide ideation (9th question score; Item 9) using the cross-correlation function. We then used an artificial neural network (ANN) to discover subtypes of depression patterns from the fitted depression trajectories. In addition, we conducted a separate analysis using the unfitted raw PHQ scores to examine PHQ-8’s and Item 9’s pattern changes. Results Results showed that the majority of patients’ PHQ-8 and Item 9 scores displayed strong temporal correlations. We found five patterns in the PHQ-8 and the Item 9 trajectories. We also found 8% - 13% of the patients have experienced an increase in suicidal ideation during the improvement of their PHQ-8. Using a trajectory-based method for subtype pattern detection in depression progression, we provided a better understanding of temporal correlations between depression symptoms over time."
https://openalex.org/W2973568122,"Sharks are top predators across ocean food webs and have a major ecological role in marine ecosystems. Investigating the trophic ecology of this group of species is thus essential to understand ecosystem functioning and inform specific management actions aimed at shark conservation. The Galapagos Islands represent one of the last ocean wildernesses, where populations of sharks and other top marine predators come close to a pristine status. Here we provide the first study on the trophic ecology of the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) within the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR), using a combination of stable isotope analysis, satellite tracking, and passive acoustic telemetry to investigate ontogenetic and spatial variations at two regions. The mean estimated δ13C and δ15N at Isabela island (western region) were -13.9 ± 0.5‰ and 13.7 ± 0.7‰; and for Santa Cruz island (central region) were -13.8 ± 0.3‰ and 13.4 ± 0.7‰, respectively. Green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) were the main prey item for large tiger sharks (>280 cm TL), while smaller sharks mainly fed on squid and pelagic fish. Tiger sharks exhibited a high degree of philopatry around green sea-turtle nesting areas, with the majority of sharks detected around green sea-turtle nesting areas for at least 10 months after their capture date, and some individuals were even present during the entire three-year study period. Although we did not report statistically significant differences between the two regions, isotopic and electronic tagging data suggest that tiger sharks in the Galapagos could be segregated into specific populations separated by geographical scales of <100 km. The high productivity of the archipelago, along with the protection from industrial fishing granted by the GMR, result in abundant and predictable sources of prey. This high food abundance, combined with the presence of suitable habitats throughout the tiger shark life cycle, might result in a reduction of migratory behaviours when compared to movement patterns of tiger sharks in other ocean basins. Additional studies using genetic tools could provide further evidence on the presence of separate management units, as it has been recently revealed for other shark species inhabiting the GMR."
https://openalex.org/W2973992289,"Background Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a pathological enlargement of infrarenal aorta close to the aortic bifurcation, and it is an important cause of mortality in the elderly. Therefore, the biomarker identification for early diagnosis is of great interest for clinical benefit. It is known that microRNAs (miRNAs) have important roles via target genes regulation in many diseases. This study aimed to identify miRNAs and their target genes involved in the pathogenesis of AAA. Methods Tissue samples were obtained from patients who underwent AAA surgery and from organ donors (control group). Quantitative PCR Array was applied to assess 84 genes and 384 miRNAs aiming to identify differentially expressed targets (AAA n = 6, control n = 6), followed by validation in a new cohort (AAA n = 18, control n = 6) by regular qPCR. The functional interaction between validated miRNAs and target genes was performed by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Results The screening cohort assessed by PCR array identified 10 genes and 59 miRNAs differentially expressed (≥2-fold change, p<0.05). Among these, IPA identified 5 genes and 9 miRNAs with paired interaction. ALOX5, PTGIS, CX3CL1 genes, and miR-193a-3p, 125b-5p, 150-5p maintained a statistical significance in the validation cohort. IPA analysis based on the validated genes and miRNAs revealed that eicosanoid and metalloproteinase/TIMP synthesis are potentially involved in AAA. Conclusion Paired interactions of differentially expressed ALOX5, PTGIS, CX3CL1 genes, and miR-193b-3p, 125b-5p, 150-5p revealed a potentially significant role of the eicosanoid synthesis and metalloproteinase/TIMP pathways in the AAA pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2974719590,"In this paper, we present a new multi-focus microscope (MFM) system based on a phase mask and HiLo algorithm, achieving high-speed (20 volumes per second), high-resolution, low-noise 3-D fluorescent imaging. During imaging, the emissions from the specimen at nine different depths are simultaneously modulated and focused to different regions on a single CCD chip, i.e., the CCD chip is subdivided into nine regions to record images from the different selected depths. Next, HiLo algorithm is applied to remove the background noises and to form clean 3-D images. To visualize larger volumes, the nine layers are scanned axially, realizing fast 3-D imaging. In the imaging experiments, a mouse kidney sample of ~ 60 × 60 × 16 μm3 is visualized with only 10 raw images, demonstrating substantially enhanced resolution and contrast as well as suppressed background noises. The new method will find important applications in 3-D fluorescent imaging, e.g., recording fast dynamic events at multiple depths in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2973752249,"Recent studies have begun to elucidate a role for E3 ubiquitin ligases as important mediators of the innate immune response. Our previous work defined a role for the ubiquitin ligase natural killer lytic-associated molecule (NKLAM/RNF19b) in mouse and human innate immunity. Here, we present novel data describing a role for NKLAM in regulating the immune response to Sendai virus (SeV), a murine model of paramyxoviral pneumonia. NKLAM expression was significantly upregulated by SeV infection. SeV-infected mice that are deficient in NKLAM demonstrated significantly less weight loss than wild type mice. In vivo, Sendai virus replication was attenuated in NKLAM-/- mice. Autophagic flux and the expression of autophagy markers LC3 and p62/SQSTM1 were also less in NKLAM-/- mice. Using flow cytometry, we observed less neutrophils and macrophages in the lungs of NKLAM-/- mice during SeV infection. Additionally, phosphorylation of STAT1 and NFκB p65 was lower in NKLAM-/- than wild type mice. The dysregulated phosphorylation profile of STAT1 and NFκB in NKLAM-/- mice correlated with decreased expression of numerous proinflammatory cytokines that are regulated by STAT1 and/or NFκB. The lack of NKLAM and the resulting attenuated immune response is favorable to NKLAM-/- mice receiving a low dose of SeV; however, at a high dose of virus, NKLAM-/- mice succumbed to the infection faster than wild type mice. In conclusion, our novel results indicate that NKLAM plays a role in regulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines during viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W2974368379,"Emission rates of diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) from building materials, such as vinyl floorings and wall paper, determined using a passive flux sampler (PFS) were constant over the week-long measurement period. Emission rates for vinyl floorings and wallpaper were linearly correlated to the inverse of diffusion distance, which corresponds to the internal depth of the PFS. Surface-air DEHP concentrations (y0) were estimated as 1.3–2.3 μg/m3 for materials having a boundary layer molecular diffusion rate-limiting step. The partition coefficient (Kmaterial-air) was estimated as 3.3–7.5 × 1010 for these materials. Additionally, emission rates of DEHP from same building materials determined using a micro-chamber were 4.5–6.1 μg/m2/h. Mass transfer coefficients in the micro-chamber (hm) were estimated by comparing the results using the PFS and micro-chamber, and these were 1.1–1.2 × 10−3 and 8.1 × 10−4 m/s for vinyl floorings (smooth surface) and wallpaper (rough surface), respectively. The thickness of boundary layer on the surface of building materials in the micro-chamber were estimated to be 2.5–2.6 and 3.7 mm for vinyl floorings and wallpaper, respectively."

However, the mechanism of these interactions and the chronology of the binding events remain largely unclear. Bcd1/ZNHIT6 are thought to be involved at early steps during the assembly of box C/D snoRNPs (13Bizarro J. Charron C. Boulon S. Westman B. Pradet-Balade B. Vandermoere F. Chagot M.E. Hallais M.

Using quantitative proteomics in human cell lines, ZNHIT6 was identified as part of an early protein-only complex together with assembly factors RUVBL1/2, NUFIP, ZNHIT3, and the core proteins SNU13 and NOP58 (13Bizarro J. Charron C. Boulon S. Westman B. Pradet-Balade B. Vandermoere F. Chagot M.E. Hallais M. Ahmad Y. Leonhardt H. Lamond A. Manival X. Branlant C. Charpentier B. Verheggen C. Bertrand E.

More recently, depletion of Bcd1 was shown to result in a significant loss of interactions between Rsa1 and Nop58, suggesting that Bcd1 participates in loading of Nop58 into an early pre-snoRNP complex (21Paul A. Tiotiu D. Bragantini B. Marty H. Charpentier B. Massenet S. Labialle S. Bcd1p controls RNA loading of the core protein Nop58 during C/D box snoRNP biogenesis.RNA. 2019; 25 (10.1261/rna.067967.118, 30700579): 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bcd1 controls the interaction of several snoRNP-related proteins with C/D snoRNAs (21Paul A. Tiotiu D. Bragantini B. Marty H. Charpentier B. Massenet S. Labialle S. Bcd1p controls RNA loading of the core protein Nop58 during C/D box snoRNP biogenesis.RNA. 2019; 25 (10.1261/rna.067967.118, 30700579): 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although depletion of BCD1 was shown to have minimal effect on the amount of Snu13 and Nop56 associated with box C/D snoRNAs, it significantly reduced the snoRNA association of assembly factors Rvb2, Pih1 and Rsa1, and the core proteins Nop58 and Nop1 (21Paul A. Tiotiu D. Bragantini B. Marty H. Charpentier B. Massenet S. Labialle S. Bcd1p controls RNA loading of the core protein Nop58 during C/D box snoRNP biogenesis.RNA. 2019; 25 (10.1261/rna.067967.118, 30700579): 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is unclear how Bcd1 coordinates all these protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and regulates the steady-state level of snoRNAs. Intriguingly, Bcd1 is reported to interact with RNAs directly in a nonspecific manner, and to bind to longer RNAs with higher affinity (16Bragantini B. Tiotiu D. Rothé B. Saliou J.M. Marty H.

Together, how Bcd1 gains specificity for assembly of box C/D snoRNPs and the significance of Bcd1-RNA interaction for maintaining snoRNA levels remain unclear. Here we define the domain organization of Bcd1/ZNHIT6 and use a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to show that Bcd1 interacts with snoRNAs and Snu13 via a conserved element near its N-terminal region. Further, we demonstrate that perturbation of these interactions leads to a significant decrease in steady-state levels of box C/D snoRNAs as well as defects in ribosome biogenesis. Together, our data provide insights into Bcd1-mediated interactions with box C/D snoRNAs and reveal their significance for snoRNP production and ribosome biogenesis. Yeast Bcd1 is an essential protein (22Peng W.T. Robinson M.D. Mnaimneh S. Krogan N.J. Cagney G. Morris Q. Davierwala A.P. Grigull J. Yang X. Zhang W. Mitsakakis N. Ryan O.W. Datta N. Jojic V.

To identify the important domains of Bcd1, we first performed a sequence alignment across eukaryotes using Clustal Omega, followed by a domain analysis using IUPred and Phyre2 (30Sievers F. Wilm A.

Bcd1 proteins fall into two groups (Fig. 1A): the first group, exemplified by human Bcd1 (ZNHIT6), contains an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) at its N terminus (residues 1 to ∼70 of ZNHIT6), a Zf-HIT domain in the middle (residues 215–258), and a wheel domain (residues 304–452). The wheel domain consists of a twisted five-stranded β sheet surrounded by several α helices and was predicted based on homology to a newly identified domain in Cns1, an essential Hsp90 co-chaperone (33Schopf F.H.

The second group, exemplified by yeast Bcd1 (Fig. 1A), contains a Zf-HIT domain at its N terminus (residues 1–45) (16Bragantini B. Tiotiu D. Rothé B. Saliou J.M. Marty H. Cianférani S. Charpentier B. Quinternet M. Manival X. Functional and structural insights of the zinc-finger HIT protein family members involved in box C/D snoRNP biogenesis.J. Mol.

Thus, Bcd1 and ZNHIT6 share similar domains that are organized differently. Previous studies showed that expression of the Zf-HIT domain of Bcd1 (residues 1–45) alone does not support the growth of yeast depleted of endogenous BCD1 (16Bragantini B. Tiotiu D. Rothé B. Saliou J.M. Marty H. Cianférani S. Charpentier B. Quinternet M. Manival X. Functional and structural insights of the zinc-finger HIT protein family members involved in box C/D snoRNP biogenesis.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428 (10.1016/j.jmb.2016.04.028, 27139642): 2488-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, a fragment encompassing residues 1–96 of Bcd1 is sufficient to maintain cell viability in the absence of BCD1 (21Paul A. Tiotiu D. Bragantini B. Marty H. Charpentier B. Massenet S. Labialle S. Bcd1p controls RNA loading of the core protein Nop58 during C/D box snoRNP biogenesis.RNA. 2019; 25 (10.1261/rna.067967.118, 30700579): 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To investigate the reason for this growth rescue, we first checked the expression of Bcd1 fragments lacking either the Zf-HIT domain (bcd147–366) or residues 1–97 (bcd197–366) in cells depleted of the endogenous BCD1 via a doxycycline-repressible promoter (tetO7::BCD1). As expected, the expression of bcd147–366 partially rescued the lethality of BCD1-depleted cells. Cells expressing bcd197–366 grew similarly to cells expressing an empty vector, implicating that Bcd1 residues 47–97 are important for cell viability (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the observed growth defects are not because of lack of protein expression, we assayed the expression of the two variant proteins (Bcd147–366 and Bcd197–366) by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). These data indicated that the two Bcd1 variants were expressed and their levels were similar to WT Bcd1. To identify which Bcd1 residues are critical for function, we individually mutated highly conserved amino acids within this region to alanine (Fig. S1) and checked the effect of each mutation on the growth of yeast cells depleted of their endogenous BCD1 and supplemented with a plasmid expressing the variant protein. Of all the conserved residues tested, the alanine substitution of Asp-72 (bcd1-D72A) showed a strong growth phenotype that resembled the growth defect observed in cells expressing vector only (Fig. 1D). Mutation of Leu-76 to alanine (L76A) also conferred a growth phenotype, albeit to a much lesser extent than D72A, indicating the overall importance of the region-spanning residues 72–76 (Fig. 1D). It is noteworthy that mutating the highly conserved residue Tyr-73 within this region did not show any effect on cell growth (Fig. 1D), indicating the specific importance of Asp-72, and to a lesser extent, Leu-76 for Bcd1 function. Because the effect from D72A mutation on cell growth was much greater than L76A, we focused on this residue for further analyses. To check whether the observed phenotype in cells expressing Bcd1-D72A was a result of protein destabilization because of the mutation, we compared the expression levels of WT and D72A proteins by Western blotting. These analyses confirmed that the protein variant was expressed to similar levels as WT Bcd1 (Fig. 1E). To compare the stability of the D72A variant and WT Bcd1 proteins, we overexpressed and purified each protein and measured their thermal unfolding (Fig. 1F). Bcd1 and Bcd1-D72A show similar apparent melting temperatures (ΔTi 2.6 °C, Fig. 1F), suggesting the D72A mutation does not lead to a global destabilization of the protein and instead likely affects Bcd1 function. Bcd1 interacts with core box C/D snoRNP proteins Nop58 and Snu13 and assembly factors Rvb2, Pih1, and Rsa1 (11McKeegan K.S. Debieux C.M. Boulon S. Bertrand E. Watkins N.J.

However, the specific role played by skin color and social class in convicting a person has yet to be clarified. This article aims to elucidate this issue by proposing that belonging to a lower social class facilitates the conviction of black targets and that this phenomenon is because information about social class dissimulates racial bias. Study 1 (N = 160) demonstrated that information about belonging to the lower classes increases agreement with a criminal suspect being sentenced to prison only when described as being black. Furthermore, Studies 2 (N = 170) and 3 (N = 174) show that the anti-prejudice norm inhibits discrimination against the black target when participants were asked to express individual racial prejudice, but not when they expressed cultural racial prejudice. Finally, Study 4 (N = 134) demonstrated that lower-class black targets were discriminated against to a greater degree when participants expressed either individual or cultural prejudice and showed that this occurs when racial and class anti-prejudice norms are salient. The results suggest that social class negatively affects judgments of black targets because judgment based on lower class mitigates the racist motivation of discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W2973775108,"The aim was to undertake secondary data analysis from a three-arm randomised feasibility trial of high intensity interval training (HIIT), moderate intensity continuous training (MICT), and usual care control in adults with Crohn’s disease (CD; n = 36), with a primary focus on exploring affective and enjoyment responses. Twenty-five participants with quiescent or mildly-active CD were randomised to one of the two exercise groups: HIIT (n = 13) and MICT (n = 12). Both groups were offered thrice weekly sessions for 12 weeks. MICT consisted of cycling for 30 minutes at 35% peak power (Wpeak), whereas HIIT involved ten 1-minute bouts at 90% Wpeak, interspersed with 1-minute bouts at 15% Wpeak. Heart rate (HR), differentiated ratings of perceived exertion for legs (RPE-L) and central (RPE-C), along with feeling state (Feeling Scale; FS) were measured at 92.5% of each session. Enjoyment was measured at the end of training using the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES). Post-hoc exploratory analysis involved a mixed-model two-way ANOVA to compare HR, RPE-L, RPE-C and FS for the exercise sessions in weeks 1, 6 and 12 between groups. Overall, HR was greater (p < 0.01) during HIIT (173 ± 8 bpm) compared with MICT (128 ± 6 bpm). Similarly, RPE-L and RPE-C responses were greater overall (p = 0.03 and p = 0.03, respectively) during HIIT (5.5 ± 1.6 and 5.1 ± 1.7, respectively) compared to MICT (3.3 ± 1.5 and 2.9 ± 1.5, respectively). Overall, FS was 2.2 ± 1.9 for HIIT and 2.1 ± 1.4 for MICT with no effect of treatment group (p = 0.25) or time (p = 0.94). There was also no significant difference in PACES scores between HIIT (99.4 ± 12.9) and MICT (101.3 ± 17.4; p = 0.78). The findings suggest HIIT and MICT protocols elicited similar enjoyment and affect in adults with quiescent or mildly-active CD."
https://openalex.org/W2974396453,"Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is an efficient method to estimate the gene expression levels but the accuracy of its result largely depends on the stability of the reference gene. Many studies have reported considerable variation in the expression of reference genes (RGs) in different tissue and conditions. Therefore, screening for appropriate RGs with stable expression is crucial for functional analysis of the target gene. Two closely related crucifers Brassica juncea (cultivated) and Camelina sativa (wild) respond differently towards various abiotic and biotic stress where C. sativa exhibits higher tolerance to various stress. Comparative gene expression analysis of the target genes between two such species is the key approach to understand the mechanism of a plant's response to stress. However, using an unsuitable RG can lead to misinterpretation of expression levels of the target gene in such studies. In this investigation, the stability of seven candidate RGs including traditional housekeeping genes (HKGs) and novel candidate RGs were identified across diverse sample sets of B. juncea and C. sativa representing- hormone treated, wounded, Alternaria brassicae inoculated and combination treated samples (exogenous hormone treatment followed by A. brassicae inoculation). In this investigation, we identified stable RGs in both the species and the most suitable RGs to perform an unbiased comparative gene expression analysis between B. juncea and C. sativa. Results revealed that TIPS41 and PP2A were identified as the overall best performing RGs in both the species. However, the most suitable RG for each sample subset representing different condition must be individually selected. In Hormone treated and wounded samples TIPS41 expressed stably in both the species and in A. brassicae inoculated and combination treatment performance of PP2A was the best. In this study, for the first time, we have identified and validated stable reference gene in C. sativa for accurate normalization of gene expression data."

We studied the prevalence and factors associated with SLE relapse during pregnancy and post-partum period in a multi-ethnic SLE cohort. Consecutive SLE patients who attended the outpatient clinic were reviewed for previous history of pregnancies in our institution. Patients who had a complete antenatal, delivery, and post-partum follow up were included. Their medical records were retrospectively analysed to assess the disease activity at pre-pregnancy/conception, during antenatal, and post-partum period. Presence of flare episodes during pregnancy and puerperium were recorded. The pregnancy outcomes recorded include live birth, foetal loss, prematurity and intra-uterine growth restrictions (IUGR). Univariate and multivariable logistic regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE) analyses were performed to determine the factors associated with disease relapse and the pregnancy outcomes. A total of 120 patients with 196 pregnancies were included, with a live birth rate of 78.6%. Four (2.0%) were diagnosed to have SLE during pregnancy. The flare rate in pregnancy was 40.1% while post-partum 17.4%. Majority of the relapse in pregnancy occurred in haematological system (62.3%) followed by renal (53.2%), musculoskeletal (22.1%), and mucocutaneous (14.3%). In GEE analyses, active disease at conception was the independent predictor of SLE relapse during and after pregnancy, whereas older maternal age and Malay ethnicity were associated with higher flare during post-partum. HCQ use was significantly associated with reduced risk of flare in univariate analysis but it was no longer significant in the GEE analyses. Presence of disease flare in pregnancy was significantly associated with prematurity. In conclusion, pregnancy in SLE need to be planned during quiescent state as pre-pregnant active disease was associated with disease relapse in both during and after pregnancy. Malay patients had an increased risk of post-partum flare but further larger prospective studies are needed to confirm the association between pregnancies in the different ancestral background."
https://openalex.org/W2973746491,"The natural product icariin inhibits human phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) and represents a unique pharmacophore for treating erectile dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and other diseases. In this study, we explore the available icariin-derived chemical scaffolds through medicinal chemistry to develop novel icariin PDE5 inhibitors with improved potency and specificity. We synthesized six novel semi-synthetic icariin analogs as well as three naturally occurring icariin analogs, and characterized the structure-activity relationship in the context of human PDE5 inhibition using in vitro enzyme inhibition and kinetics assays and molecular modeling. Mammalian-cell-based assays and in vitro enzyme inhibition assays against human PDE6C further helped to identify the most potent and selective icariin analogs. Our results reveal the synergistic contribution of functional groups at the C3 and C7 positions of the icariin backbone towards PDE5 inhibition. Whereas a hydrophobic and flexible alkanol group at the C7 position is sufficient to enhance icariin analog potency, combining this group with a hydrophilic sugar group at the C3 position leads to further enhancement of potency and promotes specificity towards PDE5 versus PDE6C. In particular, compounds 3 and 7 exhibit Ki values of 0.036 ± 0.005 μM and 0.036 ± 0.007 μM towards PDE5 respectively, which are approaching those of commercial PDE5 inhibitors, and can effectively reduce GMP levels in cultured human BJ-hTERT cells. This study identifies novel icariin analogs as potent and selective PDE5 inhibitors poised to become lead compounds for further pharmaceutical development."
https://openalex.org/W2973961307,"To evaluate the association between alcohol intake and incident chronic kidney disease measures as well as the sex differences in this association, we analyzed health screening data of 14,190,878 adults who underwent health screening ≥3 times and had glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and normal proteinuria at baseline. eGFR was calculated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Proteinuria was defined as ≥1+ dipstick proteinuria and low eGFR as <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The risk of incident proteinuria and low eGFR was analyzed with an extended Cox model with alcohol intake level as a time-varying determinant and the annual change of eGFR with generalized linear model. A J-shape association of alcohol intake with the incident proteinuria was observed in men (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.961, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.953-0.970 in men drinking alcohol <10 g/day; aHR 1.139, 95% CI, 1.123-1.154 in men drinking alcohol ≥40 g/day, compared with non-drinking men), and a positive association was seen in women (aHR, 1.034, 95% CI, 1.023-1.044 in women drinking alcohol <10 g/day; aHR, 1.094, 95% CI, 1.034-1.158 in women drinking alcohol ≥40 g/day, compared with non-drinking women). In both sexes, an inverse association of alcohol intake with the annual eGFR decline and incident low eGFR was observed. This study observed a beneficial effect of moderate alcohol intake on incident proteinuria in men and a protective effect of alcohol intake of any amount on the annual eGFR decline and incident low eGFR in both sexes. The long-term implications of these observations need to be elucidated with future studies."

Sand dunes are known as harsh soil and poor seed bank which freed from advantages on plants growth naturally. Effective restoration measures are required to guide the sand dune restoration. Here, indigenous grass (Elymus nutans) was sown in sand dune on the Zoige Plateau and treated with no sand barrier (CK) and environmental friendly materials including wicker sand barrier (wicker) and sandbag sand barrier (sandbag). The soil conditions were assessed by measuring the soil moisture and nutrients of the topsoil, and interspecific relationship and population niche were utilized to analyze the plant community structure variances among different restoration measures. Results showed that the soil and vegetation in the sand barriers measures were better than that in the CK. The soil moisture in the sandbag measure was 16.67% higher than that in the wicker measure. The nutrients content and microbial biomass were also the best in the sandbag measures. The ratio of strong association was the highest in the sandbag measure and the lowest in the CK, whereas the plants had the highest none association ratio in the CK. In addition, the average population niche overlap ranked by sandbag (0.39)>wicker (0.32)>CK (0.26). Thus, incorporation of sand barriers and indigenous grass seeding in alpine sand dunes could promote the sand dune restoration. And the sandbag measure showed a stronger improvement effect on the sand dune soil and vegetation conditions than the wicker measure."
https://openalex.org/W2974358529,"Assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain requires the coordinated synthesis of mitochondrial and nuclear encoded subunits, redox co-factor acquisition, and correct joining of the subunits to form functional complexes. The conserved Cbp3–Cbp6 chaperone complex binds newly synthesized cytochrome b and supports the ordered acquisition of the heme co-factors. Moreover, it functions as a translational activator by interacting with the mitoribosome. Cbp3 consists of two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain present in mitochondrial Cbp3 homologs and a highly conserved C-terminal domain comprising a ubiquinol–cytochrome c chaperone region. Here, we solved the crystal structure of this C-terminal domain from a bacterial homolog at 1.4 Å resolution, revealing a unique all-helical fold. This structure allowed mapping of the interaction sites of yeast Cbp3 with Cbp6 and cytochrome b via site-specific photo–cross-linking. We propose that mitochondrial Cbp3 homologs carry an N-terminal extension that positions the conserved C-terminal domain at the ribosomal tunnel exit for an efficient interaction with its substrate, the newly synthesized cytochrome b protein.

https://openalex.org/W2974733212,"Background Acute kidney injury in hospital patients is common and associated with reduced survival and higher healthcare costs. The Tackling Acute Kidney Injury (TAKI) quality improvement project aimed to reduce mortality rates in patients with acute kidney injury by implementing a multicomponent intervention comprising of an electronic alert, care bundle and education in five UK hospitals across a variety of wards. A parallel developmental evaluation using a case study approach was conducted to provide the implementation teams with insights into factors that might impact intervention implementation and fidelity. The qualitative element of the evaluation will be reported. Methods 29 semi-structured interviews with implementation teams across the five hospitals were carried out to identify perceived barriers and enablers to implementation. Interviews were taped and transcribed verbatim and Framework analysis was conducted. Results Interviews generated four ‘barriers and enablers’ to implementation themes: i) practical/contextual factors, ii) skills and make-up of the TAKI implementation team, iii) design, development and implementation approach, iv) staff knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and support. Enablers included availability of specialist teams (e.g. educational teams), multi-disciplinary implementation teams with strong leadership, team-based package completion and proactive staff. Barriers were frequently the converse of facilitators. Conclusions Despite diversity of sites, a range of common local factors–contextual, intervention-based and individual–were identified as potential barriers and enablers to fidelity, including intervention structure/design and process of/approach to implementation. Future efforts should focus on early identification and management of barriers and tailored optimisation of known enablers such as leadership and multidisciplinary teams to encourage buy-in. Improved measures of real-time intervention and implementation fidelity would further assist local teams to target their support during such quality improvement initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W2977634558,"Previous research associated the left inferior frontal cortex with implicit structure learning. The present study tested patients with lesions encompassing the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG; including Brodmann areas 44 and 45) to further investigate this cognitive function, notably by using non-verbal material, implicit investigation methods, and by enhancing potential remaining function via dynamic attending. Patients and healthy matched controls were exposed to an artificial pitch grammar in an implicit learning paradigm to circumvent the potential influence of impaired language processing.Patients and healthy controls listened to pitch sequences generated within a finite-state grammar (exposure phase) and then performed a categorization task on new pitch sequences (test phase). Participants were not informed about the underlying grammar in either the exposure phase or the test phase. Furthermore, the pitch structures were presented in a highly regular temporal context as the beneficial impact of temporal regularity (e.g. meter) in learning and perception has been previously reported. Based on the Dynamic Attending Theory (DAT), we hypothesized that a temporally regular context helps developing temporal expectations that, in turn, facilitate event perception, and thus benefit artificial grammar learning.Electroencephalography results suggest preserved artificial grammar learning of pitch structures in patients and healthy controls. For both groups, analyses of event-related potentials revealed a larger early negativity (100-200 msec post-stimulus onset) in response to ungrammatical than grammatical pitch sequence events.These findings suggest that (i) the LIFG does not play an exclusive role in the implicit learning of artificial pitch grammars, and (ii) the use of non-verbal material and an implicit task reveals cognitive capacities that remain intact despite lesions to the LIFG. These results provide grounds for training and rehabilitation, that is, learning of non-verbal grammars that may impact the relearning of verbal grammars."
https://openalex.org/W2973794563,"Land use influences the prevalence and distribution of ticks due to the intimate relationship of ticks with their environment. This relationship occurs because land use alters two essential tick requirements: vertebrate hosts for blood meals and a suitable microclimate when off-host. Given the risks to human and animal health associated with pathogens transmitted by ticks, there is an ongoing need to understand the impact of environmental drivers on tick distributions. Here, we assessed how landscape features, neighborhood effects, and edges influenced tick occupancy and abundance across an agricultural landscape in southern Africa. We found that Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and Rhipicephalus simus increased in abundance closer to protected savanna, while Haemaphysalis elliptica increased in abundance closer to human habitation. The composition of the landscape surrounding savanna patches also differentially influenced the occupancy of each tick species; H. elliptica was more likely to be found in savanna patches surrounded by subsistence agriculture while R. appendiculatus and R. simus were more likely to be found in savanna surrounded by sugarcane monocultures. At the local scale we found that R. appendiculatus and R. simus avoided savanna edges. The availability of hosts and variation in vegetation structure between commercial agriculture, subsistence agriculture, and savanna likely drove the distribution of ticks at the landscape scale. Understanding how anthropogenic land use influences where ticks occur is useful for land use planning and for assessing public and animal health risks associated with ticks and tick-borne diseases."

The susceptibility of CSFB populations from two localities to six pyrethroids, two neonicotinoids, one organophosphate and one oxadiazine was evaluated in 2015–2018 in glass vial experiments. The susceptibility of CSFB to thiacloprid and thiamethoxam was evaluated in feeding experiment in 2017 and 2018. High susceptibility of CSFB populations to lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, esfenvalerate, tau-fluvalinate, etofenprox, deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos, indoxacarb and acetamiprid was observed in the glass vial experiments. The LC50 and LC90 data obtained for pyrethroids in these experiments in 2015 represent baseline for CSFB resistance monitoring to pyrethroids in the Czech Republic. High tolerance of CSFB to thiacloprid of CSFB was demonstrated in glass vial and the feeding experiment, too."
https://openalex.org/W2974585064,"The growth inhibitory efficacy of methylseleninic acid (MSA) in prostate cancer cells has been documented extensively. However, our understanding of the immediate targets that are key to the growth inhibitory effects of MSA remains limited. Here, using multiple preclinical prostate cancer models, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that GDF15 is a most highly induced, immediate target of MSA. We further showed that knockdown of GDF15 mitigates MSA inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Analysis of gene expression data from over 1000 primary and 200 metastatic prostate cancer samples revealed that GDF15 expression is decreased in metastatic prostate cancers compared to primary tumors and that lower GDF15 levels in primary tumors are associated with higher Gleason scores and shorter survival of the patients. Additionally, pathways that are negatively correlated with GDF15 levels in clinical samples are also negatively correlated with MSA treatment in cultured cells. Since most, if not all, of these pathways have been implicated in prostate cancer progression, suppressing their activities by inducing GDF15 is consistent with the anticancer effects of MSA in prostate cancer. Overall, this study provides support for GDF15 as an immediate target of MSA in prostate cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2973388369,"Objectives The association of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activation has not been fully understood from results of previous studies using hormonal assessments. We aimed to investigate the relationship between adrenal size, a potential marker reflecting HPA axis activity, and sleep parameters related to OSA. Methods We retrospectively reviewed data on 284 consecutive adult patients aged 20 to 80 y who had undergone polysomnography and abdominal computed tomography (CT). OSA was defined as none/mild (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] <15, n = 75), moderate (AHI 15 to 30, n = 80), and severe OSA (AHI ≥30, n = 129). Widths of adrenal body and limbs were measured by abdominal CT. Results Adrenal size was greater in participants with severe OSA than in those with none/mild or moderate OSA (adrenal body width: 6.03 mm, none/mild OSA; 6.09 mm, moderate OSA; 6.78 mm, severe OSA; p <0.001; adrenal limb width: 3.75 mm, none/mild OSA; 3.95 mm, moderate OSA; 4.26 mm, severe OSA, p <0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that not the 3% oxygen desaturation index and time of SpO2 <90% but a higher arousal index was the only determinant factor for increased adrenal limb width (β = 0.27, p <0.001) after adjusting for other variables that could affect adrenal size. Neither the arousal index nor hypoxic parameters were associated with adrenal body width. Conclusions Results indicated that adrenal glands may enlarge in response to longstanding sleep fragmentation, suggesting the involvement of OSA in HPA axis augmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2974056619,"There is poor uptake of psychosocial interventions offered to people with cancer who record high scores on distress screening scales. Intervention uptake may be influenced by a mismatch between consumer (bottom-up) and professional (top-down) paradigms of wellbeing. The current research aims to compare cancer survivors' 'self-judgements' about their levels of anxiety, depression and stress, to classifications derived via a professional-driven measure, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).A cross-sectional study was undertaken with haematological cancer survivors recruited from three population-based cancer registries in Australia. Consenting participants were mailed a questionnaire package; and non-responders received a second questionnaire package after 3-weeks and a reminder call after 6-weeks. The consumer-driven perspective was assessed via three separate single items asking survivors to self-classify their levels of anxiety, depression and stress over the past week on a scale from 'normal' to 'extremely severe'. The professional-driven classification was assessed via the DASS-21. Kappa statistics were used to assess agreement between consumer- and professional-driven measures.Of 2,971 eligible haematological cancer survivors, 1,239 (42%) provided written consent and were mailed a questionnaire package. Of these, 984 (79%) returned a completed questionnaire. The simple kappa for agreement between the DASS-21 and self-classified measures for anxiety was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.39 to 0.54, p<0.0001). The weighted kappa for agreement between the DASS-21 and self-classified measures of depression was 0.60 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.67, p<0.0001) and for measures of stress was 0.51 (95% CI: 0.44 to 0.59, p<0.0001).Moderate agreement between self-classification and professional-driven assessments was found. The value of screening is predicated on the assumption that those with identified needs will be offered and take up services that will benefit them. Our results suggest that to improve the utility of distress screening it may be important to include assessment of survivor views about their symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2974878721,"Dysregulation of the seven-transmembrane (7TM) receptor Smoothened (SMO) and other components of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway contributes to the development of cancers including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma (MB). However, SMO-specific antagonists produced mixed results in clinical trials, marked by limited efficacy and high rate of acquired resistance in tumors. Here we discovered that Nilotinib, an approved inhibitor of several kinases, possesses an anti-Hh activity, at clinically achievable concentrations, due to direct binding to SMO and inhibition of SMO signaling. Nilotinib was more efficacious than the SMO-specific antagonist Vismodegib in inhibiting growth of two Hh-dependent MB cell lines. It also reduced tumor growth in subcutaneous MB mouse xenograft model. These results indicate that in addition to its known activity against several tyrosine-kinase-mediated proliferative pathways, Nilotinib is a direct inhibitor of the Hh pathway. The newly discovered extension of Nilotinib's target profile holds promise for the treatment of Hh-dependent cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2974288273,"The presence of earthworm species in crop fields is as old as agriculture itself. The earthworms Pontoscolex corethrurus (invasive) and Balanteodrilus pearsei (native) are associated with the emergence of agriculture and sedentism in the region Amazon and Maya, respectively. Both species have shifted their preference from their natural habitat to the cropland niche. They contrast in terms of intensification of agricultural land use (anthropic impact to the symbiotic soil microbiome). P. corethrurus inhabits conventional agroecosystems, while B. pearsei thrives in traditional agroecosystems, i.e., P. corethrurus has not yet been recorded in soils where B. pearsei dwells. The demographic behavior of these two earthworm species was assessed in the laboratory over 100 days, according to their origin (OE; P. corethrurus and B. pearsei) food quality (FQ; soil only, maize stubble, Mucuna pruriens), and soil moisture (SM; 25, 33, 42%). The results showed that OE, FQ, SM, and the OE x FQ interaction were highly significant for the survival, growth, and reproduction of earthworms. P. corethrurus showed a lower survival rate (> mortality). P. corethrurus survivors fed a diet of low-to-intermediate nutritional quality (soil and stubble maize, respectively) showed a greater capacity to grow and reproduce; however, it was surpassed by the native earthworm when fed a high-quality diet (M. pruriens). Besides, P. corethrurus displayed a low cocoon hatching (emergence of juveniles). These results suggest that the presence of the invasive species was associated with a negative interaction with the soil microbiota where the native species dwells, and with the absence of natural mutualistic bacteria (gut, nephridia, and cocoons). These results are consistent with the absence of P. corethrurus in milpa and pasture-type agricultural niches managed by peasants (agroecologists) to grow food regularly through biological soil management. Results reported here suggest that P. corethrurus is an invasive species that is neither wild nor domesticated, that is, its eco-evolutionary phylogeny needs to be derived based on its symbionts."
https://openalex.org/W2973615613,"Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed in advanced stages, when survival is poor. Treatment advances have been made, but are inconsistently implemented. Our purpose was to project the maximum life expectancy gains that could be achieved in women with stage IIIC epithelial ovarian cancer if the implementation of available chemotherapy regimens could be optimized.We used a microsimulation model to estimate life expectancy benefits associated with ""optimized"" implementation of four post-operative chemotherapy options: standard intravenous chemotherapy; intraperitoneal + intravenous chemotherapy; bevacizumab + intravenous chemotherapy; and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy + intravenous chemotherapy. Optimized implementation was defined as follows. Patients triaged to primary cytoreductive surgery received intraperitoneal + intravenous chemotherapy if optimally or completely cytoreduced, and bevacizumab + intravenous chemotherapy if suboptimally cytoreduced. Patients triaged to neoadjuvant chemotherapy received hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy at interval cytoreductive surgery if optimally or completely cytoreduced, and standard IV chemotherapy if suboptimally cytoreduced. Life expectancy associated with optimized implementation was compared with that of current utilization practices, estimated using published literature and the National Cancer Database. Effects of model uncertainty were evaluated in sensitivity analyses.Life expectancy associated with optimized implementation vs. current practice was 76.7 vs. 64.5 months (life expectancy gain = 12.2 months). Providing intraperitoneal + intravenous chemotherapy to all eligible patients was the largest driver of life expectancy gains, due to both the potential benefit conferred by intraperitoneal + intravenous chemotherapy and the proportion of eligible women who do not receive intraperitoneal + intravenous chemotherapy in current practice.Population-level life expectancy in stage IIIC epithelial ovarian cancer could be substantially improved through greater uptake of available chemotherapy regimens."
