https://openalex.org/W3099347064,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Although much has been learned in the first few months of the pandemic, many features of COVID-19 pathogenesis remain to be determined. For example, anosmia is a common presentation, and many patients with anosmia show no or only minor respiratory symptoms1. Studies in animals infected experimentally with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, provide opportunities to study aspects of the disease that are not easily investigated in human patients. Although the severity of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to lethal2, most experimental infections provide insights into mild disease3. Here, using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice that were originally developed for SARS studies4, we show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes severe disease in the lung and, in some mice, the brain. Evidence of thrombosis and vasculitis was detected in mice with severe pneumonia. Furthermore, we show that infusion of convalescent plasma from a recovered patient with COVID-19 protected against lethal disease. Mice developed anosmia at early time points after infection. Notably, although pre-treatment with convalescent plasma prevented most signs of clinical disease, it did not prevent anosmia. Thus, K18-hACE2 mice provide a useful model for studying the pathological basis of both mild and lethal COVID-19 and for assessing therapeutic interventions. Transgenic K18-hACE2 mice are a useful model of COVID-19 including anosmia; infection of these mice resulted in severe pneumonia and, in some cases, infection in the brain, which was prevented by convalescent plasma."

The first case of COVID-19 was declared in Togo on March 5. Two months later, few data were available to describe the circulation of the new coronavirus in the country. Objective This survey aimed to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk populations in Lomé. Materials and methods From April 23, 2020, to May 8, 2020, we recruited a sample of participants from five sectors: health care, air transport, police, road transport and informal. We collected oropharyngeal swabs for direct detection through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and blood for antibody detection by serological tests. The overall prevalence (current and past) of infection was defined by positivity for both tests. Results A total of 955 participants with a median age of 36 (IQR 32–43) were included, and 71.6% (n = 684) were men. Approximately 22.1% (n = 212) were from the air transport sector, 20.5% (n = 196) were from the police sector, and 38.7% (n = 370) were from the health sector. Seven participants (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.3–1.6%) had a positive rRT-PCR test result at the time of recruitment, and nine (0.9%, 95% CI: 0.4–1.8%) were seropositive for IgM or IgG against SARS-CoV-2. We found an overall prevalence of 1.6% (n = 15), 95% CI: 0.9–2.6%. Conclusion The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among high-risk populations in Lomé was relatively low and could be explained by the various measures taken by the Togolese government. Therefore, we recommend targeted screening."
https://openalex.org/W3099820619,"Background Injection drug use has far-reaching social, economic, and health consequences. Serious bacterial infections, including skin/soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis, bacteremia, and endocarditis, are particularly morbid and mortal consequences of injection drug use. Methods We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort analysis of hospitalizations among patients with a diagnosis code for substance use and a serious bacterial infection during the same hospital admission using Oregon Hospital Discharge Data. We examined trends in hospitalizations and costs of hospitalizations attributable to injection drug use-related serious bacterial infections from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2018. Results From 2008 to 2018, Oregon hospital discharge data included 4,084,743 hospitalizations among 2,090,359 patients. During the study period, hospitalizations for injection drug use-related serious bacterial infection increased from 980 to 6,265 per year, or from 0.26% to 1.68% of all hospitalizations ( P &lt;0.001). The number of unique patients with an injection drug use-related serious bacterial infection increased from 839 to 5,055, or from 2.52% to 8.46% of all patients ( P &lt;0.001). While hospitalizations for all injection drug use-related serious bacterial infections increased over the study period, bacteremia/sepsis hospitalizations rose most rapidly with an 18-fold increase. Opioid use diagnoses accounted for the largest percentage of hospitalizations for injection drug use-related serious bacterial infections, but hospitalizations for amphetamine-type stimulant-related serious bacterial infections rose most rapidly with a 15-fold increase. People living with HIV and HCV experienced increases in hospitalizations for injection drug use-related serious bacterial infection during the study period. Overall, the total cost of hospitalizations for injection drug use-related serious bacterial infections increased from $16,305,129 in 2008 to $150,879,237 in 2018 ( P &lt;0.001). Conclusions In Oregon, hospitalizations for injection drug use-related serious bacterial infections increased dramatically and exacted a substantial cost on the health care system from 2008 to 2018. This increase in hospitalizations represents an opportunity to initiate substance use disorder treatment and harm reduction services to improve outcomes for people who inject drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3106207412,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently become a public emergency and a worldwide pandemic. However, the information on the risk factors associated with the mortality of COVID-19 and of their prognostic potential is limited. In this retrospective study, the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome data were collected and analyzed from 676 COVID-19 patients stratified into 140 non-survivors and 536 survivors. We found that the levels of Dimerized plasmin fragment D (D-dimer), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin (PCT) were significantly higher in non-survivals on admission (non-survivors vs. survivors: D-Dimer ≥ 0.5 mg/L, 83.2% vs. 44.9%, P&lt; 0.01; CRP ≥10 mg/L, 50.4% vs. 6.0%, P&lt; 0.01; LDH ≥ 250 U/L, 73.8% vs. 20.1%, P&lt; 0.01; PCT ≥ 0.5 ng/ml, 27.7% vs. 1.8%, P&lt; 0.01). Moreover, dynamic tracking showed D-dimer kept increasing in non-survivors, while CRP, LDH and PCT remained relatively stable after admission. D-dimer has the highest C-index to predict in-hospital mortality, and patients with D-dimer levels ≥0.5 mg/L had a higher incidence of mortality (Hazard Ratio: 4.39, P &lt;0.01). Our study suggested D-dimer could be a potent marker to predict the mortality of COVID-19, which may be helpful for the management of patients."
https://openalex.org/W3099331167,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in a global testing supply shortage. In response, pooled testing has emerged as a promising strategy that can immediately increase testing capacity. In pooled sample testing, multiple samples are combined (or pooled) together and tested as a single unit. If the pool is positive, the individual samples can then be individually tested to identify the positive case(s). Here, we provide support for the adoption of sample pooling with the point-of-care Cepheid Xpert ® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. Corroborating previous findings, the limit of detection of this assay was comparable to laboratory-developed reverse-transcription quantitative PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests, with observed detection below 100 copies/mL. The Xpert ® Xpress assay detected SARS-CoV-2 after samples with minimum viral loads of 461 copies/mL were pooled in groups of six. Based on these data, we recommend the adoption of pooled testing with the Xpert ® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay where warranted based on public health needs. The suggested number of samples per pool, or the pooling depth, is unique for each point-of-care testing site and can be determined by the positive test rates. To statistically determine appropriate pooling depth, we have calculated the pooling efficiency for numerous combinations of pool sizes and test rates. This information is included as a supplemental dataset that we encourage public health authorities to use as a guide to make recommendations that will maximize testing capacity and resource conservation."
https://openalex.org/W3100792887,"Background Pneumothorax can lead to a life-threatening emergency. The experienced radiologists can offer precise diagnosis according to the chest radiographs. The localization of the pneumothorax lesions will help to quickly diagnose, which will be benefit for the patients in the underdevelopment areas lack of the experienced radiologists. In recent years, with the development of large neural network architectures and medical imaging datasets, deep learning methods have become a methodology of choice for analyzing medical images. The objective of this study was to the construct convolutional neural networks to localize the pneumothorax lesions in chest radiographs. Methods and findings We developed a convolutional neural network, called CheXLocNet, for the segmentation of pneumothorax lesions. The SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation dataset was used to train and validate CheXLocNets. The training dataset contained 2079 radiographs with the annotated lesion areas. We trained six CheXLocNets with various hyperparameters. Another 300 annotated radiographs were used to select parameters of these CheXLocNets as the validation set. We determined the optimal parameters by the AP 50 (average precision at the intersection over union (IoU) equal to 0.50), a segmentation evaluation metric used by several well-known competitions. Then CheXLocNets were evaluated by a test set (1082 normal radiographs and 290 disease radiographs), based on the classification metrics: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV); segmentation metrics: IoU and Dice score. For the classification, CheXLocNet with best sensitivity produced an AUC of 0.87, sensitivity of 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.83), and specificity of 0.78 (95% CI 0.76-0.81). CheXLocNet with best specificity produced an AUC of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.46 (95% CI 0.40-0.52), and specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94). For the segmentation, CheXLocNet with best sensitivity produced an IoU of 0.69 and Dice score of 0.72. CheXLocNet with best specificity produced an IoU of 0.77 and Dice score of 0.79. We combined them to form an ensemble CheXLocNet. The ensemble CheXLocNet produced an IoU of 0.81 and Dice score of 0.82. Our CheXLocNet succeeded in automatically detecting pneumothorax lesions, without any human guidance. Conclusions In this study, we proposed a deep learning network, called, CheXLocNet, for the automatic segmentation of chest radiographs to detect pneumothorax. Our CheXLocNets generated accurate classification results and high-quality segmentation masks for the pneumothorax at the same time. This technology has the potential to improve healthcare delivery and increase access to chest radiograph expertise for the detection of diseases. Furthermore, the segmentation results can offer comprehensive geometric information of lesions, which can benefit monitoring the sequential development of lesions with high accuracy. Thus, CheXLocNets can be further extended to be a reliable clinical decision support tool. Although we used transfer learning in training CheXLocNet, the parameters of CheXLocNet was still large for the radiograph dataset. Further work is necessary to prune CheXLocNet suitable for the radiograph dataset."
https://openalex.org/W3104317573,"Background Prenatal screening of pregnant women for HIV is central to eliminating mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) of HIV. While some countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have scaled up their prevention of MTCT programmes, ensuring a near-universal prenatal care HIV testing, and recording a significant reduction in new infection among children, several others have poor outcomes due to inadequate testing. We conducted a multi-country analysis of demographic and health surveys (DHS) to assess the coverage of HIV testing during pregnancy and also examine the factors associated with uptake. Methods We analysed data of 64,933 women from 16 SSA countries with recent DHS datasets (2015–2018) using Stata version 16. Adjusted and unadjusted logistic regression models were used to examine correlates of prenatal care uptake of HIV testing. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Results Progress in scaling up of prenatal care HIV testing was uneven across SSA, with only 6.1% of pregnant women tested in Chad compared to 98.1% in Rwanda. While inequality in access to HIV testing among pregnant women is pervasive in most SSA countries and particularly in West and Central Africa sub-regions, a few countries, including Rwanda, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia have managed to eliminate wealth and rural-urban inequalities in access to prenatal care HIV testing. Conclusion Our findings highlight the between countries and sub-regional disparities in prenatal care uptake of HIV testing in SSA. Even though no country has universal coverage of prenatal care HIV testing, East and Southern African regions have made remarkable progress towards ensuring no pregnant woman is left untested. However, the West and Central Africa regions had low coverage of prenatal care testing, with the rich and well educated having better access to testing, while the poor rarely tested. Addressing the inequitable access and coverage of HIV testing among pregnant women is vital in these sub-regions."
https://openalex.org/W3099189196,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has fast spread to over 200 countries and regions worldwide since its outbreak, while in March, Europe became the emerging epicentre. In this study, we aimed to model the epidemic trends and estimate the essential epidemic features of COVID-19 in Italy, Spain, Germany, and France at the initial stage. The numbers of daily confirmed cases and total confirmed cases were extracted from the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation reports of WHO. We applied an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to fit the epidemic trend and estimated corresponding epidemic features. The transmission rate estimates were 1.67 (95% credible interval (CrI), 1.64–1.71), 2.83 (2.72–2.85), 1.91 (1.84–1.98), and 1.89 (1.82–1.96) for Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, corresponding to the basic reproduction numbers ( R 0 ) 3.44 (3.35–3.54), 6.25 (5.97–6.55), 4.03 (3.84–4.23), and 4.00 (3.82–4.19), respectively. We found Spain had the lowest ascertainment rate of 0.22 (0.19–0.25), followed by France, Germany, and Italy of 0.45 (0.40–0.50), 0.46 (0.40–0.52), and 0.59 (0.55–0.64). The peaks of daily new confirmed cases would reach on April 16, April 5, April 21, and April 19 for Italy, Spain, Germany, and France if no action was taken by the authorities. Given the high transmissibility and high covertness of COVID-19, strict countermeasures, such as national lockdown and social distancing, were essential to be implemented to reduce the spread of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3104179593,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ), the essential cofactor derived from vitamin B3, is both a coenzyme in redox enzymatic processes and substrate in non-redox events; processes that are intimately implicated in all essential bioenergetics. A decrease in intracellular NAD + levels is known to cause multiple metabolic complications and age-related disorders. One NAD + precursor is dihydronicotinamide riboside (NRH), which increases NAD + levels more potently in both cultured cells and mice than current supplementation strategies with nicotinamide riboside (NR), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or vitamin B3 (nicotinamide and niacin). However, the consequences of extreme boosts in NAD + levels are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate the cell-specific effects of acute NRH exposure in mammalian cells. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG3) cells show dose-dependent cytotoxicity when supplemented with 100–1000 μM NRH. Cytotoxicity was not observed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells over the same dose range of NRH. PUMA and BAX mediate the cell-specific cytotoxicity of NRH in HepG3. When supplementing HepG3 with 100 μM NRH, a significant increase in ROS was observed concurrent with changes in the NAD(P)H and GSH/GSSG pools. NRH altered mitochondrial membrane potential, increased mitochondrial superoxide formation, and induced mitochondrial DNA damage in those cells. NRH also caused metabolic dysregulation, altering mitochondrial respiration. Altogether, we demonstrated the detrimental consequences of an extreme boost of the total NAD (NAD + + NADH) pool through NRH supplementation in HepG3. The cell-specific effects are likely mediated through the different metabolic fate of NRH in these cells, which warrants further study in other systemic models."
https://openalex.org/W3101539570,"Conventionally, most amino acid substitutions at “important” protein positions are expected to abolish function. However, in several soluble-globular proteins, we identified a class of nonconserved positions for which various substitutions produced progressive functional changes; we consider these evolutionary “rheostats”. Here, we report a strong rheostat position in the integral membrane protein, Na+/taurocholate (TCA) cotransporting polypeptide, at the site of a pharmacologically relevant polymorphism (S267F). Functional studies were performed for all 20 substitutions (S267X) with three substrates (TCA, estrone-3-sulfate, and rosuvastatin). The S267X set showed strong rheostatic effects on overall transport, and individual substitutions showed varied effects on transport kinetics (Km and Vmax) and substrate specificity. To assess protein stability, we measured surface expression and used the Rosetta software (https://www.rosettacommons.org) suite to model structure and stability changes of S267X. Although buried near the substrate-binding site, S267X substitutions were easily accommodated in the Na+/TCA cotransporting polypeptide structure model. Across the modest range of changes, calculated stabilities correlated with surface-expression differences, but neither parameter correlated with altered transport. Thus, substitutions at rheostat position 267 had wide-ranging effects on the phenotype of this integral membrane protein. We further propose that polymorphic positions in other proteins might be locations of rheostat positions.

Thus, substitutions at rheostat position 267 had wide-ranging effects on the phenotype of this integral membrane protein. We further propose that polymorphic positions in other proteins might be locations of rheostat positions. Amino acid substitutions are commonly used to evaluate which amino acids in a protein contribute to function. Several decades of studies have led to conventional “rules” for mutational outcomes that are now included in many textbooks and are often implicitly or explicitly assumed in the design and interpretation of experimental studies. For instance, at “important” protein positions, only amino acids with biochemical properties similar to the wildtype (WT) are expected to allow function, whereas other amino acid substitutions are expected to abolish function or structure. However, the mutational studies that gave rise to these rules were primarily focused on evolutionarily conserved amino acid positions (1Gray V.E. Kukurba K.R. Kumar S. Performance of computational tools in evaluating the functional impact of laboratory-induced amino acid mutations.Bioinformatics. 2012; 28: 2093-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When we performed substitution studies of less conserved positions, results were seldom consistent with expected outcomes. Instead of an on/off pattern, when nonconserved positions were substituted with a variety of amino acids, each substitution had a different outcome. The fact that one position could be substituted to access a continuum of functional outcomes is analogous to an electronic dimmer switch; therefore, these positions have been labeled as “rheostat” positions (2Hodges A.M. Fenton A.W. Dougherty L.L. Overholt A.C. Swint-Kruse L.

Mutat. 2018; 39: 1814-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 3Meinhardt S. Manley Jr., M.W. Parente D.J. Swint-Kruse L. Rheostats and toggle switches for modulating protein function.PLoS One. 2013; 8e83502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 4Wu T. Swint-Kruse L. Fenton A.W. Functional tunability from a distance: rheostat positions influence allosteric coupling between two distant binding sites.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 16957Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To date, biochemical studies of rheostat positions have been limited to a few positions within a few proteins. As of yet, there are insufficient data to demonstrate how widespread such positions are in the protein universe or their general properties. As part of our efforts to expand general knowledge of rheostat positions, we chose the integral membrane transport protein human Na+/taurocholate (TCA) cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) as a model system, which allowed us to address three specific areas of interest. First, we were curious whether rheostat positions were limited to the soluble-globular class of proteins in which they were discovered (3Meinhardt S. Manley Jr., M.W. Parente D.J. Swint-Kruse L. Rheostats and toggle switches for modulating protein function.PLoS One. 2013; 8e83502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), or if they also exist in transmembrane (TM) proteins. Because soluble and integral membrane proteins evolved under different chemical environments, the properties of one class are not always transferable to the other. In the context of rheostat positions, it helps to know in which types of proteins to expect them. Predictions about substitutions at rheostat positions require different algorithms than predictions at positions that follow textbook substitution rules (5Miller M. Bromberg Y. Swint-Kruse L. Computational predictors fail to identify amino acid substitution effects at rheostat positions.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 41329Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 6Miller M. Vitale D. Kahn P.C. Rost B. Bromberg Y. funtrp: identifying protein positions for variation driven functional tuning.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: e142Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Second, if rheostat positions do exist in integral membrane proteins, we wondered whether the functional outcomes arising from various substitutions were dependent on the substrate being transported. That is, we wished to explore the effects of substitutions at rheostat positions on substrate specificity. Although our prior work suggested such substitutions could have complex effects on specificity (7Tungtur S. Schwingen K.M. Riepe J.J. Weeramange C.J. Swint-Kruse L. Homolog comparisons further reconcile in vitro and in vivo correlations of protein activities by revealing over-looked physiological factors.Protein Sci. 2019; 28: 1806-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), that work was carried out with non-natural proteins and ligands. The present study, using a natural protein known to transport multiple different substrates, provided opportunity to further document this complex substitution outcome. Amino acid changes that alter substrate specificity are key to the evolution of functional variation and may thus also give rise to different drug sensitivities. Third, many of the rheostat positions identified to date are located outside binding sites and do not directly contact ligand or substrate. As such, their molecular mechanisms of action have been difficult to explain (8Fenton A.W. Page B.M. Spellman-Kruse A. Hagenbuch B. Swint-Kruse L. Rheostat positions: a new classification of protein positions relevant to pharmacogenomics.Med. Chem. Res. 2020; 29: 1133-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Recent studies of a rheostat position in a transcription repressor have indicated that substitutions may alter protein dynamics (9Campitelli P. Swint-Kruse L. Ozkan S.B. Substitutions at non-conserved rheostat positions modulate function by Re-wiring long-range, dynamic interactions.Mol. Biol. Evol. August 11, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa202Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Thus, the present study provided opportunity to relate the continuum of functional outcomes of the rheostat variants to the complex conformational changes experienced by an integral membrane protein during transport. Several features of NTCP facilitated the studies listed previously: This protein is expressed at the basolateral membrane of human hepatocytes where it plays an important role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids (10Hagenbuch B. Dawson P. The sodium bile salt cotransport family SLC10.Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition to conjugated bile acids such as TCA, NTCP mediates the uptake of other substrates into hepatocytes, including estrone-3-sulfate and several statins such as rosuvastatin (11Claro da Silva T. Polli J.E. Swaan P.W. The solute carrier family 10 (SLC10): beyond bile acid transport.Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34: 252-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several single nucleotide polymorphisms have been reported to alter the transport activity of NTCP (12Ho R.H. Leake B.F. Roberts R.L. Lee W. Kim R.B. Ethnicity-dependent polymorphism in Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (SLC10A1) reveals a domain critical for bile acid substrate recognition.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7213-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which we reasoned might enable the identification of rheostat positions from the 349 positions that comprise this protein. From various analyses, we identified position 267 as a potential rheostat position in NTCP. Next, we assessed the function of WT NTCP and all 19 amino acid substitutions at position 267 with cellular uptake studies. We also determined whether substitution outcomes were substrate dependent by measuring transport of TCA, estrone-3-sulfate, and rosuvastatin. Additional experiments differentiated the effects of substitutions on protein surface expression and transport kinetics. Finally, we used homology modeling of the available “inward-open” and “outward-open” conformations and energetic calculations to explore the “rheostatic” relationship between protein stability and surface expression. Because generalizable features for identifying rheostat positions have not yet been validated, we first faced the challenge of identifying a likely candidate among the 349 amino acid positions of NTCP. Thus, we combined two types of information—functional insights and sequence analysis—to identify a likely rheostat position for the present study. The functional information derived from knowledge of NTCP polymorphisms with clinical consequences. The most frequent and best characterized of these is NTCP∗2, which leads to the missense amino acid substitution S267F and has an allele frequency of 7.5% in Chinese Americans. Previously published data for S267F indicated reduced transport of TCA, WT-like transport of estrone-3-sulfate, and increased transport of rosuvastatin in vitro (12Ho R.H. Leake B.F. Roberts R.L.

Inadequate plasma membrane expression would make functional studies problematic; thus, this single nucleotide polymorphism was not further explored in the current work. Polymorphic positions are, by definition, nonconserved. Likewise, the previously identified rheostat positions in the soluble LacI/GalR homologs were also nonconserved and had moderate to high phylogeny scores (3Meinhardt S. Manley Jr., M.W. Parente D.J. Swint-Kruse L. Rheostats and toggle switches for modulating protein function.PLoS One. 2013; 8e83502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Tungtur S. Schwingen K.M. Riepe J.J. Weeramange C.J.

Thus, to further strengthen our reasoning that NTCP position 267 should be explored as a potential rheostat position before embarking on experiments, we assessed these evolutionary properties. Position 267 was previously reported to be highly conserved among many different animals, including primates, rodents, dogs, cats, horses, chicken, several fish, and marine chordate (15Deng M. Mao M. Guo L. Chen F.P. Wen W.R. Song Y.Z. Clinical and molecular study of a pediatric patient with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide deficiency.Exp. Ther. Med. 2016; 12: 3294-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, when we expanded the sequence alignment to include 1561 homologs of the solute carrier family 10A (SLC10A) (11Claro da Silva T. Polli J.E. Swaan P.W. The solute carrier family 10 (SLC10): beyond bile acid transport.Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34: 252-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) representing all kingdoms of life (see NTCP Sequence Alignment File in the Supporting Information), position 267 had a sequence entropy of 1.54. This intermediate conservation score (overall range of 0.0–2.8) suggested that position 267 could tolerate multiple substitutions without catastrophic outcomes, which is requisite for most amino acid substitutions at rheostat positions. When we further analyzed the expanded sequence alignment with ConSurf (https://consurf.tau.ac.il) (18Ashkenazy H. Abadi S. Martz E. Chay O. Mayrose I. Pupko T. Ben-Tal N. ConSurf 2016: an improved methodology to estimate and visualize evolutionary conservation in macromolecules.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: W344-W350Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), position 267 had a score of 8 (on a scale of 1–9), indicating a pattern of change that highly correlated with the branching of the SLC10A phylogenetic tree. This characteristic has been hypothesized to be indicative of positions important for evolving functional variation, (e.g. [19Mazin P.V. Gelfand M.S. Mironov A.A. Rakhmaninova A.B. Rubinov A.R.

To experimentally ascertain whether position 267 was a rheostat position, we replaced serine with all other n19 amino acids and measured uptake of TCA (Fig. 1, top), estrone-3-sulfate (Fig. 1, middle), and rosuvastatin (Fig. 1, bottom) for each substitution. On the left side of Figure 1, uptake is shown with the amino acids in alphabetical order, with WT at far left. The right panels show results ordered from highest to lowest transport, with WT placed within the series. Notably, for all three substrates, some variants transported substrates better than WT, whereas others had diminished transport. The range of observed changes spanned several orders of magnitude. Thus, position 267 exhibited definitive rheostatic substitution behavior. Furthermore, the rank order of the amino acid substitutions differed among the three substrates. This is further discussed later, but here, we particularly note that the NTCP∗2 polymorphism, S267F, showed a significant decrease in TCA transport, a 2.0-fold increase for estrone-3-sulfate transport, and 2.5-fold increase for rosuvastatin transport. Previous reports showed decreased TCA transport, estrone-3-sulfate levels similar to WT, and increased rosuvastatin transport (12Ho R.H. Leake B.F. Roberts R.L. Lee W. Kim R.B.

The discrepancy for estrone-3-sulfate could arise from the slightly different uptake conditions, including substrate concentrations, incubation time, and/or different cell lines used in the two studies. Protein substitutions can alter substrate transport kinetics, substrate specificity, protein stability, and/or intracellular trafficking to the outer membrane. The cellular uptake assay is sensitive to changes in any of these parameters. Thus, we devised experiments to dissect the functional and structural contributions. To assess the combined effects of trafficking and stability, we quantified differences in surface expression of NTCP variants using surface biotinylation experiments followed by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). When normalized for the loading control Na+/K+ATPase, the expression levels varied between 22.5% for S267Q and 153% for S267W, corresponding to an overall variation of about sevenfold. The expression of most of the other variants was similar to WT (Fig. 2B). Thus, NTCP appeared to accommodate different amino acid side chains at position 267 without significantly disrupting the overall structure or trafficking to the cell surface. Next, initial uptake experiments from Figure 1 were corrected for the surface expression, and results are shown in Figure 3. The overall rheostat-like behavior remained, showing that substitutions altered transport function. The rank orders of S267 substitutions were further analyzed using correlation plots to illustrate the effects on substrate specificity (Fig. 4). Inspection of these plots showed that striking specificity differences were evident for four amino acids (C, F, W, and Y) in the comparison of TCA to estrone-3-sulfate, for five amino acids (C, F, H, W, and Y) for TCA to rosuvastatin, and for one amino acid (C) for estrone-3-sulfate to rosuvastatin. The differential effects of these substitutions—including the clinically relevant polymorphism F—for transporting alternative substrates are a hallmark of altered substrate specificity (7Tungtur S. Schwingen K.M. Riepe J.J. Weeramange C.J. Swint-Kruse L.

On each panel, several substitutions (red dots) were outliers as compared with the others (black dots), which is a hallmark of altered substrate specificity. For the nonoutlier substitutions, the Pearson coefficient, which is a measure of the linear correlation, was >0.91 (p < 0.0001) for all three substrate comparisons. The Spearman coefficient, which correlates rank order, also showed a strong correlation with values of 0.7 to 0.87 (p < 0.0001) (Table S3). For the correlated substitutions, the slopes of the three trend lines were A, 0.42 (95% confidence intervals of 0.32–0.52), B, 0.39 (0.28–0.49), and C, 1.15 (0.96–1.34), respectively. Slopes that differ significantly from 1 are another hallmark of altered specificity (7Tungtur S. Schwingen K.M. Riepe J.J. Weeramange C.J. Swint-Kruse L.

This suggests that estrone-3-sulfate and rosuvastatin, with the highest Pearson and Spearman values (Fig. 4C and Table S1), share similar modes of interaction with position 267. When these outlier variants were excluded, the remaining variants showed significant correlation (Fig. 4 and Table S3), illustrating that the amino acid substitutions had the same direction of change for the alternative substrates. For rosuvastatin and estrone-3-sulfate, the slope of the line was near 1. However, for the other two correlations, the slopes of the lines were less than 1, which is another sign of altered specificity for TCA by these substitutions ([7Tungtur S. Schwingen K.M. Riepe J.J.

Based on the results presented in Figure 3, we performed a full kinetic analysis for select variants: WT, S267F (the NTCP∗2 polymorphism), S267N, and S267W. Asparagine at position 267 was chosen because this substitution resulted in similar uptake as WT for estrone-3-sulfate and rosuvastatin but higher uptake for TCA. In contrast, the tryptophan substitution was chosen because it resulted in lower uptake for TCA but higher uptake for estrone-3-sulfate and rosuvastatin. For these four proteins, concentration dependent uptake was assessed under initial linear rate conditions using transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. After normalizing for surface expression, we analyzed the results using the Michaelis–Menten equation and calculated Km and Vmax values (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Both the Km and Vmax were frequently altered, indicating altered substrate affinity and transporter turnover.Table 1Kinetic values for substrate uptake mediated by WT NTCP and selected variantsSubstrateNTCPS267FS267NS267WTCA Km (μM)42 ± 6.673 ± 5659 ± 18153 ± 50 Vmax (nmol/mg/min)5.7 ± 0.51.9 ± 0.65.9 ± 1.81.7 ± 0.1 Vmax/Km (μl/mg/min)134 ± 2426 ± 22102 ± 4411 ± 3.7Estrone-3-sulfate Km (μM)155 ± 1842 ± 5.7420 ± 17321 ± 6.7 Vmax (nmol/mg/min)2.3 ± 0.24.2 ± 0.613 ± 4.71.7 ± 0.5 Vmax/Km (μl/mg/min)15 ± 2.399 ± 1931 ± 1781 ± 33Rosuvastatin Km (μM)183 ± 5173 ± 21171 ± 2688 ± 12 Vmax (nmol/mg/min)4.5 ± 1.08.2 ± 1.76.3 ± 0.94.1 ± 0.4 Vmax/Km (μl/mg/min)25 ± 8.9112 ± 3937 ± 7.647 ± 7.4NTCP, Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide; TCA, taurocholate; WT, wildtype.Uptake of increasing concentrations of TCA, estrone-3-sulfate, and rosuvastatin by human embryonic kidney 293 cells transiently transfected with either WT NTCP or variants S267F, S267N, and S267W was measured at 37 °C under initial linear rate conditions.

https://openalex.org/W3100759574,"Motivation The human microbiome is variable and dynamic in nature. Longitudinal studies could explain the mechanisms in maintaining the microbiome in health or causing dysbiosis in disease. However, it remains challenging to properly analyze the longitudinal microbiome data from either 16S rRNA or metagenome shotgun sequencing studies, output as proportions or counts. Most microbiome data are sparse, requiring statistical models to handle zero-inflation. Moreover, longitudinal design induces correlation among the samples and thus further complicates the analysis and interpretation of the microbiome data. Results In this article, we propose zero-inflated Gaussian mixed models (ZIGMMs) to analyze longitudinal microbiome data. ZIGMMs is a robust and flexible method which can be applicable for longitudinal microbiome proportion data or count data generated with either 16S rRNA or shotgun sequencing technologies. It can include various types of fixed effects and random effects and account for various within-subject correlation structures, and can effectively handle zero-inflation. We developed an efficient Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to fit the ZIGMMs by taking advantage of the standard procedure for fitting linear mixed models. We demonstrate the computational efficiency of our EM algorithm by comparing with two other zero-inflated methods. We show that ZIGMMs outperform the previously used linear mixed models (LMMs), negative binomial mixed models (NBMMs) and zero-inflated Beta regression mixed model (ZIBR) in detecting associated effects in longitudinal microbiome data through extensive simulations. We also apply our method to two public longitudinal microbiome datasets and compare with LMMs and NBMMs in detecting dynamic effects of associated taxa."

This study aims to present the potential impacts of COVID-19 in this region and to model possible benefits of mitigation efforts. The COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics was used to estimate the probable evolution of COVID-19 in three scenarios: (i) no social distancing, (ii) social distancing in place at 50% effectiveness, and (iii) social distancing in place at 60% effectiveness. Projections of the number of inpatient hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and patients requiring ventilators were made for each scenario. Using the model described, it was predicted that peak case volume at 0% mitigation was to occur on April 30, 2020 at 11,553,566 infected individuals. Peak case volume at 50% mitigation was predicted to occur on June 1, 2020 with 5,970,093 infected individuals and on June 21, 2020 for 60% mitigation with 4,128,574 infected individuals. Occupancy rates in hospitals during peak periods at 0%, 50%, and 60% mitigation would be 875.9%, 322.8%, and 203.5%, respectively, when all inpatient beds are included. Under these scenarios, peak daily hospital admissions would be 40,438, 13,820, and 8,650. Additionally, 60% mitigation would result in a decrease in peak intensive care beds from 94,706 to 23,116 beds and a decrease in peak ventilator need from 67,889 to 17,087 units. Mitigating the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing could have a dramatic impact on reducing the number of infected people and minimize hospital overcrowding. These evidence-based models may enable careful resource utilization and encourage targeted public health responses."
https://openalex.org/W3100667224,"The ST6Gal-I sialyltransferase, an enzyme that adds α2-6-linked sialic acids to N-glycosylated proteins, regulates multiple immunological processes. However, the contribution of receptor sialylation to inflammatory signaling has been under-investigated. In the current study, we uncovered a role for ST6Gal-I in promoting sustained signaling through two prominent inflammatory pathways, NFκB and JAK/STAT. Using the U937 monocytic cell model, we determined that knockdown (KD) of ST6Gal-I expression had no effect on the rapid activation of NFκB by TNF (≤ 30 min), whereas long-term TNF-induced NFκB activation (2-6 hr) was diminished in ST6Gal-I-KD cells. These data align with prior work in epithelial cells showing that α2-6 sialylation of TNFR1 prolongs TNF-dependent NFκB activation. Similar to TNF, long-term, but not short-term, LPS-induced activation of NFκB was suppressed by ST6Gal-I KD. ST6Gal-I KD cells also exhibited reduced long-term IRF3 and STAT3 activation by LPS. Given that ST6Gal-I activity modulated LPS-dependent signaling, we conducted pull-down assays using SNA (a lectin specific for α2-6 sialic acids) to show that the LPS receptor, TLR4, is a substrate for sialylation by ST6Gal-I. We next assessed signaling by IFNγ, IL-6 and GM-CSF, and found that ST6Gal-I-KD had a limited effect on STAT activation induced by these cytokines. To corroborate these findings, signaling was monitored in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) from mice with myeloid-specific deletion of ST6Gal-I (LysMCre/ST6Gal-Ifl/fl). In agreement with data from U937 cells, BMDMs with ST6Gal-I knockout displayed reduced long-term activation of NFκB by both TNF and LPS, and diminished long-term LPS-dependent STAT3 activation. However, STAT activation induced by IFNγ, IL-6 and GM-CSF was comparable in wild-type and ST6Gal-I knockout BMDMs. These results implicate ST6Gal-I-mediated receptor sialylation in prolonging the activity of select signaling cascades including TNF/NFκB, LPS/NFκB, and LPS/STAT3, providing new insights into ST6Gal-I's role in modulating the inflammatory phenotype of monocytic cells."

We assessed the sublethal effects of TCAP on Spodoptera exigua . We also investigated the effects of TCAP on non-target Harmonia axyridis and Eisenia fetida , S . exigua was more sensitive to TCAP than to chlorantraniliprole, as the LC 50 (10.371 μg L -1 at 72 h) of TCAP was relatively lower. Compared with those of the control, sublethal concentrations of TCAP (LC 10 and LC 30 ) not only prolonged the duration of the larval and pupal stages as well as the mean generation time but also reduced certain population parameters. On the other hand, TCAP exposure, even at the highest concentration, did not induce toxic effects in H . axyridis ladybugs (1 st instar larvae and adults) or E . fetida earthworms.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in a population of Tunisian older adults (N = 141, aged 65 and over). Patients were recruited from the Department of Internal Medicine, Fattouma Bourguiba University Hospital (Monastir, Tunisia) and from a nursing home (Sousse, Tunisia). Comprehensive geriatric assessment, history taking and examination including functional and nutritional assessment were done for each participant. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test was used to measure serum cytokine (TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6) levels. The modified Short Emergency Geriatric Assessment score (SEGAm) were used to classify patients as 51 very-frail, 40 frail, and 50 non-frail. The age of the participants (80 men, 61 women) ranged from 65 to 97 years. Serum levels of TNF-α, IL-8 and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher in very-frail participants compared to frail and non-frail ones. However, no significant differences in IL-6 levels were detected among frailty groups. After adjustment for age, CRP and IL-8 levels remained significantly associated with frailty. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve corresponding to IL-8 showed an area under the curve of 0.7 ( p = 0.003; 95% CI [0.58–0.81]) and a predictive threshold of 5.27 pg/ml. Positive correlations were found between frailty score, IL-6, and IL-8 levels. In addition, a significant positive correlation was observed between IL-8 levels and Timed Up and Go test results. However, a negative correlation was observed between Mini Nutritional Assessment Short-Form score, IL-6 and CRP levels, as well as between Activities of Daily Living score and serum levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP. In conclusion, the key findings of this study collectively support a role of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, CRP, and especially IL-8 in the development of frailty in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3098754698,"Introduction The capacity of women to decide on their healthcare plays a key role in their health. In this study, we examined the association between women’s healthcare decision-making capacity and their healthcare seeking behaviour for childhood illnesses in Ghana. Materials and methods We used data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. A total sample of 2,900 women with children less than 5 years was used for the analysis. Data were processed and analysed using STATA version 14.0. Chi-square test of independence and binary logistic regression were carried out to generate the results. Statistical significance was pegged at 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We relied on the ‘Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology’ (STROBE) statement in writing the manuscript. Results Out of the 2,900 women, approximately 25.7% could take healthcare decisions alone and 89.7% sought healthcare for childhood illnesses. Women who decided alone on personal healthcare had 30% reduced odds of seeking healthcare for childhood illnesses compared to those who did not decide alone [AOR = 0.70, CI = 0.51–0.97]. With age, women aged 45–49 had 69% reduced odds of seeking healthcare for childhood illnesses compared to those aged 25–29 [AOR = 0.31, CI = 0.14–0.70]. Women from the Northern and Upper West regions had 72% [AOR: 0.28, CI: 0.11–0.70] and 77% [AOR: 0.23, CI: 0.09–0.58] reduced odds of seeking healthcare for childhood illnesses respectively, compared to those from the Western region. Conclusion Ghanaian women with autonomy in healthcare decision-making, those who were older and those from the Northern and Upper West regions were less likely to seek healthcare for childhood illness. To reduce childhood mortalities and morbidities in Ghana, we recommend educating women such as those who take healthcare decisions alone, older women and women from deprived regions like the Northern and Upper West regions on the need to seek healthcare for childhood illnesses."

LDA assumes that each document deals with a set of predefined topics, which are distributions over an entire vocabulary. Our main objective is to use the probability of a document belonging to each topic to implement a new text representation model. This proposed technique is deployed as an extension of the Weka software as a new filter. To demonstrate its performance, the created filter is tested with different classifiers such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Naive Bayes in different documental corpora (OHSUMED, Reuters-21578, 20Newsgroup, Yahoo!

https://openalex.org/W3100243599,"Clostridioides difficile is responsible for various intestinal symptoms from mild diarrhea to severe pseudomembranous colitis and is the primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults. Metronidazole was the first-line treatment for mild to moderate C . difficile infections for 30 years. However, clinical failure and recurrence rates of metronidazole is superior to oral vancomycin and metronidazole is now recommended only as an alternative to vancomycin or fidaxomicin, for an initial non-severe infection. The mechanisms of treatment failure and infection recurrence remain unclear. Given the poor fecal concentrations of metronidazole, the bacteria may be exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of metronidazole and develop adaptation strategy, which is likely to be the origin of an increase in treatment failures. In this study, a proteomic approach was used to analyze changes in the proteome of two strains with different levels of susceptibility to metronidazole in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of this antibiotic. The two strains were grown to stationary phase: CD17-146, a clinical C . difficile isolate with reduced susceptibility to metronidazole, and VPI 10463, a metronidazole susceptible strain. Our study revealed that, whatever the strain, subinhibitory concentrations of metronidazole modified the amount of proteins involved in protein biosynthesis, glycolysis, and protection against stress induced by metronidazole, as well as in DNA repair. Several proteins involved in stress response are known to be synthesized under the control of Sigma factor B, which suggests a close link between Sigma factor B and metronidazole. Interestingly, impact of metronidazole on protein production for VPI 10463 strain differed from CD17-146 strain, for which the amount of two proteins involved in biofilm formation of CD17-146 were modified by metronidazole."
https://openalex.org/W3102179982,"Cancer research in the news is often associated with sensationalised and inaccurate reporting, which may give rise to false hopes and expectations. The role of study selection for cancer-related news stories is an important but less commonly acknowledged issue, as the outcomes of primary research are generally less reliable than those of meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Few studies have investigated the quality of research that makes the news and no previous analyses of the proportions of primary and secondary research in the news have been found in the literature. We analysed distribution of study types, research sources, reporting quality, gender bias, and national bias in online news reports by four major news outlets in USA, UK and Australia over six-months. We measured significant variation in reporting quality and observed biases in many aspects of cancer research reporting, including the types of study selected for coverage, the spectrum of cancer types, gender of scientists, and geographical source of research represented. We discuss the implications of these findings for guiding accurate, contextual reporting of cancer research, which is critical in helping the public understand complex science, appreciate the outcomes of publicly-funded research, maintain trust, and assist informed decision-making. The striking gender bias observed may compromise high-quality coverage of research by limiting diversity of opinion, reinforces stereotypes and skews public visibility and recognition towards male scientists.

Therefore, we investigated the clinical impact of preoperative DM on postoperative morbidity and survival in individuals with resectable NSCLC. Patients and methods Data of individuals who underwent pulmonary resection for NSCLC from 2000 to 2015 were extracted from the database of Kyoto University Hospital. The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative complications, and secondary endpoints were postoperative length of hospital stay and overall survival. The survival rate was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method. Results A total of 2,219 patients were eligible for the study. The median age of participants was 67 years. Among them, 39.5% were women, and 259 (11.7%) presented with DM. The effect of DM on the incidence of postoperative complications and postoperative length of hospital stay was not significant. Although the 5-year survival rates were similar in both patients with and without DM (80.2% versus 79.4%; p = 0.158), those with DM who had a hemoglobin A1c level ≥ 8.0% had the worst survival. Conclusions In individuals with resectable NSCLC, preoperative DM does not influence the acute phase postoperative recovery. However, poorly controlled preoperative DM could lead to low postoperative survival rates."
https://openalex.org/W3104525493,"Spinal fusion is a commonly performed orthopedic surgery. Autologous bone graft obtained from the iliac crest is frequently employed to perform spinal fusion. Osteogenic bone marrow stromal (a.k.a. mesenchymal stem) cells (BMSCs) are believed to be responsible for new bone formation and development of the bridging bone during spinal fusion, as these cells are located in both the graft and at the site of fusion. Our previous work revealed the importance of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Our objective here was to determine the impact of BMSC oxidative metabolism on osseointegration of the graft during spinal fusion. The first part of the study was focused on correlating oxidative metabolism in bone graft BMSCs to radiographic outcomes of spinal fusion in human patients. The second part of the study was focused on mechanistically proving the role of BMSC oxidative metabolism in osseointegration during spinal fusion using a genetic mouse model. Patients’ iliac crest-derived graft BMSCs were identified by surface markers. Mitochondrial oxidative function was detected in BMSCs with the potentiometric probe, CMXRos. Spinal fusion radiographic outcomes, determined by the Lenke grade, were correlated to CMXRos signal in BMSCs. A genetic model of high oxidative metabolism, cyclophilin D knockout (CypD KO), was used to perform spinal fusion in mice. Graft osseointegration in mice was assessed with micro-computed tomography. Our study revealed that higher CMXRos signal in patients’ BMSCs correlated with a higher Lenke grade. Mice with higher oxidative metabolism (CypD KO) had greater mineralization of the spinal fusion bridge, as compared to the control mice. We therefore conclude that higher oxidative metabolism in BMSCs correlates with better spinal fusion outcomes in both human patients and in a mouse model. Altogether, our study suggests that promoting oxidative metabolism in osteogenic cells could improve spinal fusion outcomes for patients."

Although both disorders are associated with brain volumetric abnormalities, it is necessary to unfold the shared and specific volume abnormalities that could contribute to explain the similarities and differences in the clinical and neurocognitive profiles between ADHD and ASD. In this voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study, regional grey matter volumes (GMV) were compared between 22 children with ADHD, 18 children with ASD and 17 typically developing (TD) children aged 8 to 12 years old, controlling for age and total intracranial volume. When compared to TD children or children with ASD, children with ADHD had a larger left precuneus, and a smaller right thalamus, suggesting that these brain abnormalities are specific to ADHD relative to ASD. Overall, this study contributes to the delineation of disorder-specific structural abnormalities in ADHD and ASD."

Popular mapping approaches such as point allocation or voronoi tessellation provide only crude approximations of the mobile network coverage as they do not consider holes, overlaps and within-cell heterogeneity. More elaborate mapping schemes often require additional proprietary data operators are highly reluctant to share. In this paper, I use human settlement information extracted from publicly available satellite imagery in combination with stochastic radio propagation modelling techniques to account for that. I show in a simulation study and a real-world application on unemployment estimates in Senegal that better coverage approximations do not necessarily lead to better outcome predictions."

Twenty-four post-stroke participants who were physically inactive took part in the study. The wMRT OFF was correlated with the following: skeletal muscle mass (r s = -0.46), skeletal muscle mass index (r s = -0.45), augmentation index (r s = 0.44), augmentation index normalized to a heart rate of 75 bpm (r s = 0.64), reflection magnitude (r s = 0.43), erythrocyte (r s = -0.61), hemoglobin (r s = -0.54), hematocrit (r s = -0.52) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (r s = 0.58), all p &lt; 0.05. A greater amount of oxygen uptake during post-walking recovery is partially related to lower skeletal muscle mass, greater arterial stiffness, reduced number of erythrocytes and higher systemic inflammation in post-stroke individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3099679123,"Attention-deficit /hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by age-inappropriate levels of motor activity, impulsivity and attention. The aim of the present study was to study diurnal variation of motor activity in adult ADHD patients, compared to healthy controls and clinical controls with mood and anxiety disorders. Wrist-worn actigraphs were used to record motor activity in a sample of 81 patients and 30 healthy controls. Time series from registrations in the morning and evening were analyzed using measures of variability, complexity and a newly developed method, the similarity algorithm, based on transforming time series into graphs. In healthy controls the evening registrations showed higher variability and lower complexity compared to morning registrations, however this was evident only in the female controls. In the two patient groups the same measures were not significantly different, with one exception, the graph measure bridges. This was the measure that most clearly separated morning and evening registrations and was significantly different both in healthy controls and in patients with a diagnosis of ADHD. These findings suggest that actigraph registrations, combined with mathematical methods based on graph theory, may be used to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the diurnal regulation of motor activity."
https://openalex.org/W3104645219,"The dragline silk of spiders is of particular interest to science due to its unique properties that make it an exceptional biomaterial that has both high tensile strength and elasticity. To improve these natural fibers, researchers have begun to try infusing metals and carbon nanomaterials to improve mechanical properties of spider silk. The objective of this study was to incorporate carbon nanomaterials into the silk of an orb-weaving spider, Nephila pilipes , by feeding them solutions containing graphene and carbon nanotubes. Spiders were collected from the field and in the lab were fed solutions by pipette containing either graphene sheets or nanotubes. Major ampullate silk was collected and a tensile tester was used to determine mechanical properties for pre- and post-treatment samples. Raman spectroscopy was then used to test for the presence of nanomaterials in silk samples. There was no apparent incorporation of carbon nanomaterials in the silk fibers that could be detected with Raman spectroscopy and there were no significant improvements in mechanical properties. This study represents an example for the importance of attempting to replicate previously published research. Researchers should be encouraged to continue to do these types of investigations in order to build a strong consensus and solid foundation for how to go forward with these new methods for creating novel biomaterials."
https://openalex.org/W3099440494,"Objective Even though all guidelines recommend generally against antipsychotic polypharmacy, antipsychotic polypharmacy appears to be a very common practice across the globe. This study aimed to examine the prescription patterns of antipsychotics in Qatar, in comparison with the international guidelines, and to scrutinize the sociodemographic and clinical features associated with antipsychotic polypharmacy. Methods All the medical records of all the inpatients and outpatients treated by antipsychotics at the Department of Psychiatry–Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) in Doha, Qatar (between October 2012 and April 2014) were retrospectively analyzed. We retrieved the available sociodemographic data, psychiatric features, and details on the medication history. Results Our sample consisted of 537 individuals on antipsychotics (2/3 were male; mean age 33.8±10.2 years), prescribed for a psychotic disorder in 57%, a mood disorder in 9.3%, and various other diagnoses in 33.7%. About 55.9% received one antipsychotic, 29.6% received two antipsychotics, and 14.5% received more than two antipsychotics. Polypharmacy was associated with younger age (p = 0.025), being single (p&lt;0.001), the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (p&lt;0.001), and previous admissions to psychiatry (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Antipsychotic polypharmacy appears to be quite common in Qatar, as it is the case in many other countries, in contrast with most international recommendations. Studies are needed to explore the reasons behind this disparity."
https://openalex.org/W3102464805,"Biomedical question answering (QA) represents a growing concern among industry and academia due to the crucial impact of biomedical information. When mapping and ranking candidate snippet answers within relevant literature, current QA systems typically refer to information retrieval (IR) techniques: specifically, query processing approaches and ranking models. However, these IR-based approaches are insufficient to consider both syntactic and semantic relatedness and thus cannot formulate accurate natural language answers. Recently, deep learning approaches have become well-known for learning optimal semantic feature representations in natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we present a deep ranking recursive autoencoders (rankingRAE) architecture for ranking question-candidate snippet answer pairs (Q-S) to obtain the most relevant candidate answers for biomedical questions extracted from the potentially relevant documents. In particular, we convert the task of ranking candidate answers to several simultaneous binary classification tasks for determining whether a question and a candidate answer are relevant. The compositional words and their random initialized vectors of concatenated Q-S pairs are fed into recursive autoencoders to learn the optimal semantic representations in an unsupervised way, and their semantic relatedness is classified through supervised learning. Unlike several existing methods to directly choose the top-K candidates with highest probabilities, we take the influence of different ranking results into consideration. Consequently, we define a listwise “ranking error” for loss function computation to penalize inappropriate answer ranking for each question and to eliminate their influence. The proposed architecture is evaluated with respect to the BioASQ 2013-2018 Six-year Biomedical Question Answering benchmarks. Compared with classical IR models, other deep representation models, as well as some state-of-the-art systems for these tasks, the experimental results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of rankingRAE."

In addition, severe periodontal disease was identified as the significant risk factor for complications after gastrointestinal surgery. We investigated the bacteriological association between the periodontal pocket, stomach mucosa and drainage fluid to determine whether oral bacteria directly cause intra-abdominal infection after gastrectomy.Patients who were scheduled to undergo surgery for gastric cancer were prospectively enrolled. We evaluated the similarity of bacterial strains in periodontal pocket, stomach mucosa and fluid from drainage tube. Gingival crevicular fluid and dental plaque were collected from the periodontal pocket and cultured to detect bacteria. Specimens from the resected stomach were collected and used for bacterial culturing. Drainage fluid from the abdominal cavity was also cultured.All of 52 patients were enrolled. In the periodontal pocket, α-Streptococcus spp., Neisseria sp., and Prevotella sp. were mainly detected. Bacterial cultures in the stomach mucosa were positive in 26 cases. In 20 cases (76.9%), the detected strains were the same as those in the periodontal pocket. Six patients had the postoperative intra-abdominal infection after gastrectomy, and the same bacterial strains was detected in both of drainage fluid and periodontal pocket in two patients with severe periodontal disease.We found the bacteriological association that same strain detected in periodontal pocket, stomach and in intra-abdominal drainage fluid after gastrectomy in patients with periodontal disease."
https://openalex.org/W3103938992,"Fatty acids ( FA ) provide an energy source to the liver during negative energy balance; however, when FA influx is excessive, FA can be stored as liver lipids or incompletely oxidized to β-hydroxybutyrate ( BHB ). The objectives of this study were to quantify plasma and liver FA profiles and hepatic gene expression in cows diagnosed with hyperketonemia ( HYK ; BHB ≥ 1.2 m M ) or not ( nonHYK ; BHB &lt; 1.2 m M ) to determine a relationship between FA profile and expression of hepatic genes related to oxidation and gluconeogenesis. Production parameters, blood samples (-28, -3, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14 d relative to parturition; n = 28 cows), and liver biopsies (1, 14, and 28 d postpartum; n = 22 cows) were collected from Holstein cows. Cows were retrospectively grouped as HYK or nonHYK based on BHB concentrations in postpartum blood samples. Average first positive test (BHB ≥ 1.2 m M ) was 9 ± 5 d (± SD). Cows diagnosed with HYK had greater C18:1 and lower C18:2 plasma proportions. Liver FA proportions of C16:0 and C18:1 were related to proportions in plasma, but C18:0 and C18:2 were not. Some interactions between plasma FA and HYK on liver FA proportion suggests that there may be preferential use depending upon metabolic state. Cows diagnosed with HYK had decreased pyruvate carboxylase ( PC ) expression, but no difference at 1 d postpartum in either cytosolic or mitochondrial isoforms of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ( PCK ). The increased PC to PCK ratios in nonHYK cows suggests the potential for greater hepatic oxidative capacity, coinciding with decreased circulating BHB. Interestingly, FA, known regulators of PC expression, were not correlated with PC expression at 1 d postpartum. Taken together, these data demonstrate that HYK cows experience a decrease in the ratio of hepatic PC to PCK at 1 day postpartum prior to HYK diagnosis which, on average, manifested a week later. The differential regulation of PC involved in HYK diagnosis may not be completely due to shifts in FA profiles and warrants further investigation."

The aim of this study was to examine deformations in modern positive- and negative-powered silicone hydrogel soft contact lenses (SiH SCLs) after 7 days of continuous wear. This pre-post interventional study included 64 eyes: 42 eyes with myopia of -3.00 D and 22 eyes with hyperopia of +3.00 D. All patients underwent general ophthalmic examination, corneal topography/tomography, total corneal and epithelial thickness mapping, and specular microscopy before and after the wearing period. SiH SCLs made of senofilcon A were worn continuously for 7 days on all eligible eyes. The geometry of the new and used lenses was measured 3 to 6 minutes after removal in two perpendicular planes using a custom-made swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) system for in vitro measurements. The anterior and posterior radii of curvature decreased in -3.00 D lenses in two perpendicular planes. This effect correlated significantly with average keratometry of the cornea. Sagittal lens height was lower in +3.00 D lens after wear, which correlated moderately with the corneal sagittal height. A significant decrease in central corneal epithelial thickness was observed after wearing +3.0 D lenses. In conclusion, SiH SCLs made of senofilcon A undergo minor deformations after 7-day continuous wear. Geometry modifications are different for -3.00 D and +3.00 D lenses, and they imitate the shape of the anterior eye surface. These geometric changes are accompanied by a decrease in the central thickness of corneal epithelium after +3.00 D lens wear."
https://openalex.org/W3102049787,"Background There is a growing momentum in paediatric ethics to develop respectful research and healthcare protocols. We developed, tested and refined our ‘Respectful Approach to Child-centred Healthcare’ (ReACH), to underpin respectful participant interactions in a clinical trial. Objective To determine whether a ReACH-based approach is acceptable to children and parents, and effective in obtaining compliance with common healthcare assessments in a clinical trial of healthy 4-6-year-old children. Methods ReACH-based child assessments were evaluated at two baseline clinics and one post-intervention, using mixed methods. Children (n = 49; 46.9% female; mean age = 5.24±0.88 years at baseline) and their parents provided independent evaluation, via customised 5-point Likert scales and qualitative feedback. A dedicated child researcher evaluated adherence to the study ReACH principles. Results Children achieved compliance rates of 95% for body composition (BodPod) assessments; 89% for blood pressure measurements, and 92% (baseline) and 87% (post-intervention) for blood draws. Adherence to ReACH principles during clinic visits was positively associated with child compliance, significantly for baseline BodPod (p = 0.002) and blood test (p = 0.009) clinics. Satisfaction with BodPod protocols was positively associated with compliance, for children at baseline (p = 0.029) and for parents post-intervention (p &lt;0.001). Parents rated the study itself very highly, with 91.7% satisfied at baseline and 100% post-intervention. Qualitative feedback reflected an enjoyable study experience for both parents and children. Conclusions Adherence to our emerging ReACH approach was associated with high child compliance rates for common healthcare assessments, although no causality can be inferred at this preliminary stage of development. Participants expressed satisfaction with all aspects of the study. Our use of child-centred methods throughout a research intervention appears feasible and acceptable to children and their parents."
https://openalex.org/W3103785635,"Drought and heat stress constrain wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) yields globally. To identify putative mechanisms and candidate genes associated with combined drought and heat stress tolerance, we developed bread wheat near-isogenic lines (NILs) targeting a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 6B which was previously associated with combined drought and heat stress tolerance in a diverse panel of wheats. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to identify additional regions that segregated in allelic pairs between the recurrent and the introduced exotic parent, genome-wide. NILs were phenotyped in a gravimetric platform with precision irrigation and exposed to either drought or to combined drought and heat stress from three days after anthesis. An increase in grain weight in NILs carrying the exotic allele at 6B locus was associated with thicker, greener leaves, higher photosynthetic capacity and increased water use index after re-watering. RNA sequencing of developing grains at early and later stages of treatment revealed 75 genes that were differentially expressed between NILs across both treatments and timepoints. Differentially expressed genes coincided with the targeted QTL on chromosome 6B and regions of genetic segregation on chromosomes 1B and 7A. Pathway enrichment analysis showed the involvement of these genes in cell and gene regulation, metabolism of amino acids and transport of carbohydrates. The majority of these genes have not been characterized previously under drought or heat stress and they might serve as candidate genes for improved abiotic stress tolerance."

We analyzed antibody titer dynamics following PCR-confirmed influenza B virus infection in a longitudinal community-based cohort study conducted in Hong Kong from 2009–2014 to assess patterns in changes in antibody titers to B/Victoria and B/Yamagata viruses following infections with each lineage. Among 62 PCR-confirmed cases, almost half had undetectable hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers to the lineage of infection both pre-infection and post-infection. Among those infected with influenza B/Victoria who showed an HAI titer response after infection, we found strong rises to the lineage of infection, positive but smaller cross-lineage HAI titer boosts, a small dependence of HAI titer boosts on pre-infection titers, and a shorter half-life of HAI titers in adults. Our study is limited by the low HAI sensitivity for non-ether-treated IBV antigen and the incapacity of performing other assays with higher sensitivity, as well as the mismatch between the B/Yamagata lineage circulating strain and the assay strain in one of the study seasons."
https://openalex.org/W3105687388,Resources that an individual selects contrasted against what is available can provide valuable information regarding species-specific behavior and ecological relationships. Small mammals represent excellent study organisms to assess such relationships. Isolated populations that exist on the edge of a species’ distribution often exhibit behavioral adaptations to the extremes experienced by a species and can provide meaningful insight into the resource requirements of the species. We deployed radio transmitters in a peripheral population of the long-tailed vole ( Microtus longicaudus) during the mating season. We developed models of resource selection at multiple scales (within home range and patch). We found voles generally selected areas close to water and roads and consisting of high understory vegetation primarily composed of grasses. Resource selection varied between sexes suggesting different resource needs during the breeding season. The differential resource needs of voles might be a result of the energetic requirements for reproduction and are representative of a promiscuous or polygynous mating system.

We applied a supervised elastic net penalized logistic regression model to predict PIK3CA mutations from gene expression data. This regression approach was applied to predict modeling using the TCGA pan-cancer dataset. Approximately 10,000 cases were available for PIK3CA mutation and mRNA expression data. In 10-fold cross-validation, the model with λ = 0.01 and α = 1.0 (ridge regression) showed the best performance, in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). The final model was developed with selected hyper-parameters using the entire training set. The training set AUROC was 0.93, and the test set AUROC was 0.84. The area under the precision-recall (AUPR) of the training set was 0.66, and the test set AUPR was 0.39. Cancer types were the most important predictors. Both insulin like growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF1R ) and the phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) were the most significant genes in gene expression predictors. Our study suggests that predicting genomic alterations using gene expression data is possible, with good outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3101727670,"Background Novel approaches are required to better focus latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) efforts in low-prevalence regions. Geographic information systems, used within large health systems, may provide one such approach. Methods A retrospective, cross-sectional design was used to integrate US Census and Duke Health System data between January 1, 2010 and October 31, 2017 and examine the relationships between LTBI screening and population tuberculosis risk (assessed using the surrogate measure of proportion of persons born in tuberculosis-endemic regions) by census tract. Results The median proportion of Duke patients screened per census tract was 0.01 (range 0–0.1, interquartile range 0.01–0.03). The proportion of Duke patients screened within a census tract significantly but weakly correlated with the population risk. Furthermore, patients residing in census tracts with higher population tuberculosis risk were more likely to be screened with TST than with an IGRA (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion The weak correlation between patient proportion screened for LTBI and our surrogate marker of population tuberculosis risk suggests that LTBI screening efforts should be better targeted. This type of geography-based analysis may serve as an easily obtainable benchmark for LTBI screening in health systems with low tuberculosis prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W3104266380,"Transhumeral percutaneous osseointegrated prostheses provide upper-extremity amputees with increased range of motion, more natural movement patterns, and enhanced proprioception. However, direct skeletal attachment of the endoprosthesis elevates the risk of bone fracture, which could necessitate revision surgery or result in loss of the residual limb. Bone fracture loads are direction dependent, strain rate dependent, and load rate dependent. Furthermore, in vivo , bone experiences multiaxial loading. Yet, mechanical characterization of the bone-implant interface is still performed with simple uni- or bi-axial loading scenarios that do not replicate the dynamic multiaxial loading environment inherent in human motion. The objective of this investigation was to reproduce the dynamic multiaxial loading conditions that the humerus experiences in vivo by robotically replicating humeral kinematics of advanced activities of daily living typical of an active amputee population. Specifically, 115 jumping jack, 105 jogging, 15 jug lift, and 15 internal rotation trials—previously recorded via skin-marker motion capture—were replicated on an industrial robot and the resulting humeral trajectories were verified using an optical tracking system. To achieve this goal, a computational pipeline that accepts a motion capture trajectory as input and outputs a motion program for an industrial robot was implemented, validated, and made accessible via public code repositories. The industrial manipulator utilized in this study was able to robotically replicate over 95% of the aforementioned trials to within the characteristic error present in skin-marker derived motion capture datasets. This investigation demonstrates the ability to robotically replicate human motion that recapitulates the inertial forces and moments of high-speed, multiaxial activities for biomechanical and orthopaedic investigations. It also establishes a library of robotically replicated motions that can be utilized in future studies to characterize the interaction of prosthetic devices with the skeletal system, and introduces a computational pipeline for expanding this motion library."
https://openalex.org/W3098705180,"In pediatric cases requiring quantification of cerebral blood flow (CBF) using 123 I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine ( 123 I-IMP) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), arterial blood sampling is sometimes impossible due to issues such as movement, crying, or body motion. If arterial blood sampling fails, quantitative diagnostic assessment becomes impossible despite radiation exposure. We devised a new easy non-invasive microsphere (e-NIMS) method using whole-body scan data. This method can be used in conjunction with autoradiography (ARG) and can provide supportive data for invasive CBF quantification. In this study, we examined the usefulness of e-NIMS for pediatric cerebral perfusion semi-quantitative SPECT and compared it with the invasive ARG. The e-NIMS estimates cardiac output (CO) using whole-body acquisition data after 123 I-IMP injection and the body surface area from calculation formula. A whole-body scan was performed 5 minutes after the 123 I-IMP injection and CO was estimated by region of interest (ROI) counts measured for the whole body, lungs, and brain using the whole-body anterior image. The mean CBF (mCBF) was compared with that acquired via ARG in 115 pediatric patients with suspected cerebrovascular disorders (age 0–15 years). Although the mCBF estimated by the e-NIMS indicated a slight deviation in the extremely low- or high-mCBF cases when compared with the values acquired using the invasive ARG, there was a good correlation between the two methods (r = 0.799; p &lt; 0.001). There were no significant differences in the mCBF values based on physical features, such as patients’ height, weight, and age. Our findings suggest that 123 I-IMP brain perfusion SPECT with e-NIMS is the simplest semi-quantitative method that can provide supportive data for invasive CBF quantification. This method may be useful, especially in pediatric brain perfusion SPECT, when blood sampling or identifying pulmonary arteries for CO estimation using the graph plot method is difficult."
https://openalex.org/W3099365940,"The text-evaluation application Coh-Metrix and natural language processing rely on the sentence for text segmentation and analysis and frequently detect sentence limits by means of punctuation. Problems arise when target texts such as pop song lyrics do not follow formal standards of written text composition and lack punctuation in the original. In such cases it is common for human transcribers to prepare texts for analysis, often following unspecified or at least unreported rules of text normalization and relying potentially on an assumed shared understanding of the sentence as a text-structural unit. This study investigated whether the use of different transcribers to insert typographical symbols into song lyrics during the pre-processing of textual data can result in significant differences in sentence delineation. Results indicate that different transcribers (following commonly agreed-upon rules of punctuation based on their extensive experience with language and writing as language professionals) can produce differences in sentence segmentation. This has implications for the analysis results for at least some Coh-Metrix measures and highlights the problem of transcription, with potential consequences for quantification at and above sentence level. It is argued that when analyzing non-traditional written texts or transcripts of spoken language it is not possible to assume uniform text interpretation and segmentation during pre-processing. It is advisable to provide clear rules for text normalization at the pre-processing stage, and to make these explicit in documentation and publication."
https://openalex.org/W3101838350,"Due to the changes in consumer demand and generational transformations, Kyoto’s traditional craft industry has suffered substantial revenue losses in recent years. This research aimed to characterize Kyoto’s traditional craft industry by analyzing the supplier-customer network involving individual firms within the Kyoto region. In the process, we clarify the community structure, key firms, network topological characteristics, bow-tie structure, robustness, the vulnerability of the supplier-customer network as crucial factors for sustainable growth. The community and bow-tie structure analysis became clear that the traditional craft industry continues to occupy an important position in Kyoto’s industrial network. Furthermore, we clarify the relationship between modern and traditional craft industries’ network characteristics and their relative profitability and productivity. It became evident that the traditional craft industry has a different network structure from the modern consumer games and electric machinery industries. The modern industries have the strongly coupled component, and the attendant firms there create high value-added and play a significant role in driving the entire industry, while more traditional craft industries, such as the Nishijin silk fabrics and Kyoto doll industries, do not have this strongly coupled component. Moreover, the traditional crafts industry does not have a central firm or a dense network for integrating information, which is presumed to be a factor in the decline of the traditional craft industry."
https://openalex.org/W3102517251,"Gene therapy is a promising treatment option for cancer. However, its utility may be limited due to expression in off-target cells. Cancer-specific promoters such as telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), survivin, and chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) have enhanced activity in a variety of human and murine cancers, however, little has been published regarding these promoters in dogs. Given the utility of canine cancer models, the activity of these promoters along with adenoviral E2F enhanced E1a promoter (EEE) was evaluated in a variety of canine tumors, both from the endogenous gene and from exogenously administered constructs. Endogenous expression levels were measured for cTERT, cSurvivin, and cCXCR4 and were low for all three, with some non-malignant and some tumor cell lines and tissues expressing the gene. Expression levels from exogenously supplied promoters were measured by both the number of cells expressing the construct and the intensity of expression in individual cells. Exogenously supplied promoters were active in more cells in all tumor lines than in normal cells, with the EEE promoter being most active, followed by cTERT. The intensity of expression varied more with cell type than with specific promoters. Ultimately, no single promoter was identified that would result in reliable expression, regardless of the tumor type. Thus, these findings imply that identification of a pan-cancer promoter may be difficult. In addition, this data raises the concern that endogenous expression analysis may not accurately predict exogenous promoter activity."

We investigated the effects of a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor (PDE5I) on the urinary bladder after pelvic radiotherapy. Eight rats were assigned to each group (group 1: control; group 2: radiation; group 3: radiation plus PDE5I). Radiation dose was 10 Gy/one fraction. Udenafil (20 mg/kg, daily for 4 weeks) was administered in group 3. Cystometry was performed 4 weeks after treatment, followed by real-time PCR for PDE5, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA, western blotting for PDE5, cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PRKG), VEGF 164 , Akt, eNOS and NADPH oxidase (NOX)-2 proteins, and immunohistochemistry for eNOS. The expression of both VEGF mRNA and eNOS mRNA was higher in group 3 than in group 2. VEGF and eNOS protein expression improved with PDE5I treatment. Akt protein phosphorylation was higher in group 3 than in group 2, but NOX-2 protein expression was lower in group 3 than in group 2. Immunohistochemistry showed that the mean density of arterioles expressing eNOS was higher in group 3 than in group 2. Cystometry revealed that the intercontraction interval was remarkably longer in group 3 than in group 2 but that the maximal voiding pressure was higher in group 2 than in group 3. Daily treatment with a PDE5I after radiotherapy may prevent bladder storage dysfunction, potentially due to its effects on vasodilation and angiogenesis and through minimizing tissue oxidative damage by means of the VEGF/Akt/eNOS pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3106036976,"Children acquire vowels earlier than consonants, and the former are less vulnerable to speech disorders than the latter. This study explores the hypothesis that a similar contrast exists later in life and that consonants are more vulnerable to ageing than vowels. Data was obtained with two experiments comparing the speech of Younger Adults (YAs) and Middle–aged Adults (MAs). In the first experiment an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system was trained with a balanced corpus of 29 YAs and 27 MAs. The productions of each speaker were obtained in a Spanish language word (W) and non–word (NW) repetition task. The performance of the system was evaluated with the same corpus used for training using a cross validation approach. The ASR system recognized to a similar extent the Ws of both groups of speakers, but it was more successful with the NWs of the YAs than with those of the MAs. Detailed error analysis revealed that the MA speakers scored below the YA speakers for consonants and also for the place and manner of articulation features; the results were almost identical in both groups of speakers for vowels and for the voicing feature. In the second experiment a group of healthy native listeners was asked to recognize isolated syllables presented with background noise. The target speakers were one YA and one MA that had taken part in the first experiment. The results were consistent with those of the ASR experiment: the manner and place of articulation were better recognized, and vowels and voicing were worse recognized, in the YA speaker than in the MA speaker. We conclude that consonant articulation is more vulnerable to ageing than vowel articulation. Future studies should explore whether or not these early and selective changes in articulation accuracy might be caused by changes in speech perception skills (e.g., in auditory temporal processing)."
