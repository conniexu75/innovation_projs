The oceanic distribution of cadmium is similar to that of the nutrients, hence the cadmium/calcium ratio in shells records temporal variations in nutrient distributions. Data from a North Atlantic sediment core show that over the past 200,000 years there has been a continuous supply of nutrient-depleted waters into the deep North Atlantic. The intensity of this source relative to nutrient-enriched southern waters diminished by about a factor of 2 during severe glaciations. This evidence combined with carbon isotope data indicates that the continental carbon inventory may have been less variable than previously suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2108711430,"Oceanic macroaggregates (marine snow and Rhizosolenia mats) sampled from the Sargasso Sea are associated with bacterial and protozoan populations up to four orders of magnitude greater than those present in samples from the surrounding water. Filamentous, curved, and spiral bacteria constituted a higher proportion of the bacteria associated with the particles than were found among bacteria in the surrounding water. Protozoan populations were dominated numerically by heterotrophic microflagellates, but ciliates and amoebas were also observed. Macroaggregates are highly enriched heterotrophic microenvironments in the oceans and may be significant for the cycling of particulate organic matter in planktonic food chains."
https://openalex.org/W2092989718,"The myrmecophilus beetle Myrmecaphodius excavaticollis (Blanchard) was found to have species-specific cuticular hydrocarbons acquired-from one of its hosts, the ant Solenopsis richteri Forel. Removal from its ant host resulted in loss of the host hydrocarbons, leaving a cuticular pattern innate to the beetle. When beetles were transferred to colonies of three other Solenopsis species, they acquired the specific hydrocarbons associated with each of the new hosts. This passive integration mechanism is coupled with the beetle's armored exterior to enable it to cope with multiple aggressive hosts."

Kaolinite was synthesized at pH values from 2 to 9 and with a ratio of SiO(2) to Al(2)O(3) in solution from 1 to 10 by means of the complexation of Al(3+) and fulvic acid."

A less favored model for the field perturbations involves variations in the thickness of the low-conductivity crustal layer of the moon."
https://openalex.org/W2033662216,"Each of seven Australasian tektites contains about 1 × 108 atoms of beryllium-10 (half-life, 1.53 × 106 years) per gram. Cosmic-ray bombardment of the australites cannot have produced the measured amounts of beryllium-10 either at the earth's surface or in space. The beryllium-10 contents of these australites are consistent with a sedimentary precursor that adsorbed from precipitation beryllium-10 produced in the atmosphere. The sediments must have spent several thousand years at the earth's surface within a few million years of the tektite-producing event."

https://openalex.org/W2009746585,"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on Kurt Godel's theorem contribution to mathematics. The recent discovery of two natural but undecidable statements indicates that Godel's theorem is more than just a logician's trick. Godel shook the world of mathematics by showing that there are statements in every logical system whose truth or falsehood simply cannot be determined by staying within the system. The Paris–Harrington theorem is a slight variation of Ramsey's theorem. According to Ramsey's theorem, if there is an infinite set and a color, say red or blue, is assigned arbitrarily to each pair of members of the set, then an infinite subset can be found, all of whose pairs are red or all of whose pairs are blue. Paris and Harrington used model theory, a standard method of mathematical logic, to show that their theorem is undecidable in Peano arithmetic. The more natural but undecidable theorems that are found, of course, the more willing mathematicians are to believe that Godel's theorem might apply to important results."
https://openalex.org/W2045334375,"Venation patterns of the leaves of two lycophytes, Selagiella adunca and Selaginella schaffneri, do not fit the definition of microphylls as having a single, unbranched vein. Although S. adunca has a simple pattern, S. schaffneri has a complexity matching that of many megaphylls, with numerous branching veins. The veins of S. schaffneri undergo an average of 13 branchings (range, 8 to 21), and reticulation between veins is frequent. The discovery of this radical departure from the familiar microphylls of lycophytes indicates that complex venation patterns in leaves do not necessarily arise from fusion of whole branches. The microphyll may not be as structurally stable as formerly believed."
https://openalex.org/W2042406837,"An extensive blanket of dacitic tephra was deposited across Alaska and the western Yukon Territory by a plinian eruption about 80,000 years ago. The volume of tephra erupted probably exceeded 50 cubic kilometers and the source was probably in the Wrangell Mountains. This widespread layer of tephra serves as an excellent late Pleistocene stratigraphic marker."
https://openalex.org/W2044850163,The new age determination of 9 × 108 years for the Hyades yields an e-folding time for lithium depletion in G dwarfs of 1.1 × 109 years and an e-folding time for rotational braking of around 2.2 × 109 years. A proposal is made that the change in solar rotation over the past 250 million years be determined by analyzing petrified trees.

https://openalex.org/W4242025911,"It has been called to our attention that our announcement of the granting of the Third Intermediate Sugar Research Foundation Award to Leslie F. Wiggins (Science, May 14, p. 502) was incorrect in several respects. The Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, mentioned in the item as being located in Kingston, Jamaica, and as having been ""recently created,"" is actually located in Trinidad, B.W.I., and has been in existence for 27 years. We learn that it was founded as the West Indian Agricultural College in 1921 and that its name was changed to its present one in 1924. It was also stated in the announcement that Dr. Wiggins had been appointed research director at the College. His appointment was as director of sugar research under a new Sugar Research Scheme launched in 1947. We regret that these misstatements occurred."
