https://openalex.org/W2754189939,"A mucus layer covers and protects the intestinal epithelial cells from direct contact with microbes. This mucus layer not only prevents inflammation but also plays an essential role in microbiota colonization, indicating the complex interplay between mucus composition-microbiota and intestinal health. However, it is unknown whether the mucus layer is influenced by age or sex and whether this contributes to reported differences in intestinal diseases in males and females or with ageing. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effect of age on mucus thickness, intestinal microbiota composition and immune composition in relation to sex. The ageing induced shrinkage of the colonic mucus layer was associated with bacterial penetration and direct contact of bacteria with the epithelium in both sexes. Additionally, several genes involved in the biosynthesis of mucus were downregulated in old mice, especially in males, and this was accompanied by a decrease in abundances of various Lactobacillus species and unclassified Clostridiales type IV and XIV and increase in abundance of the potential pathobiont Bacteroides vulgatus. The changes in mucus and microbiota in old mice were associated with enhanced activation of the immune system as illustrated by a higher percentage of effector T cells in old mice. Our data contribute to a better understanding of the interplay between mucus-microbiota-and immune responses and ultimately may lead to more tailored design of strategies to modulate mucus production in targeted groups."

Currently, the relative contribution of MPS and MPB to the loss of LBM during ER in humans is unknown. We aimed to determine the impact of dietary protein intake and resistance exercise on MPS and MPB during a controlled short-term energy deficit. Adult men (body mass index, 28.6 ± 0.6 kg/m2; age 22 ± 1 yr) underwent 10 d of 40%-reduced energy intake while performing unilateral resistance exercise and consuming lower protein (1.2 g/kg/d, n = 12) or higher protein (2.4 g/kg/d, n = 12). Pre- and postintervention testing included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, primed constant infusion of ring-[13C6]phenylalanine, and 15[N]phenylalanine to measure acute postabsorptive MPS and MPB; D2O to measure integrated MPS; and gene and protein expression. There was a decrease in acute MPS after ER (higher protein, 0.059 ± 0.006 to 0.051 ± 0.009%/h; lower protein, 0.061 ± 0.005 to 0.045 ± 0.006%/h; P < 0.05) that was attenuated with resistance exercise (higher protein, 0.067 ± 0.01%/h; lower protein, 0.061 ± 0.006%/h), and integrated MPS followed a similar pattern. There was no change in MPB (energy balance, 0.080 ± 0.01%/hr; ER rested legs, 0.078 ± 0.008%/hr; ER exercised legs, 0.079 ± 0.006%/hr). We conclude that a reduction in MPS is the main mechanism that underpins LBM loss early in ER in adult men.-Hector, A. J., McGlory, C., Damas, F., Mazara, N., Baker, S. K., Phillips, S. M. Pronounced energy restriction with elevated protein intake results in no change in proteolysis and reductions in skeletal muscle protein synthesis that are mitigated by resistance exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2755019485,"Endothelial cells (ECs) in the tumor microenvironment have been reported to play a more active role in solid tumor growth and metastatic dissemination than simply providing the physical structure to form conduits for blood flow; however, the involvement of ECs in the process of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) metastasis has not been addressed. Here, we demonstrate that ECs—when mixed with TNBC cells—could increase TNBC cell metastatic potency. After treatment with TGF-p to induce endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), TNBC cells could produce plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and stimulate the expression and secretion of the che- mokine, CCL5, from ECs, which then acts in a paracrine fashion on TNBC cells to enhance their migration, invasion, and metastasis. CCL5, in turn, accelerates TNBC cell secretion of PAI-1 and promotes TNBC cell metastasis, thus forming a positive feedback loop. Moreover, this enhanced metastatic ability is reversible and dependent on CCL5 signaling via the chemokine receptor, CCR5. Of importance, key features of this pathway are manifested in patients with TNBC and in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Taken together, our results suggest that ECs enhance EMT- induced TNBC cell metastasis via PAI-1 and CCL5 signaling and illustrate the potential of developing new PAI-1- and CCL5-targeting therapy for patients with TNBC.—Zhang, W., Xu, J., Fang, H., Tang, L., Chen, W., Sun, Q., Zhang, Q., Yang, F., Sun, Z., Cao, L., Wang, Y., Guan, X.

https://openalex.org/W2755701752,"For decades, the enzymes of the fungus Hypocrea jecorina have served as a model system for the breakdown of cellulose. Three-dimensional structures for almost all H. jecorina cellulose-degrading enzymes are available, except for HjLPMO9A, belonging to the AA9 family of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). These enzymes enhance the hydrolytic activity of cellulases and are essential for cost-efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass. Here, using structural and spectroscopic analyses, we found that native HjLPMO9A contains a catalytic domain and a family-1 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM1) connected via a linker sequence. A C terminally truncated variant of HjLPMO9A containing 21 residues of the predicted linker was expressed at levels sufficient for analysis. Here, using structural, spectroscopic, and biochemical analyses, we found that this truncated variant exhibited reduced binding to and activity on cellulose compared with the full-length enzyme. Importantly, a 0.95-Å resolution X-ray structure of truncated HjLPMO9A revealed that the linker forms an integral part of the catalytic domain structure, covering a hydrophobic patch on the catalytic AA9 module. We noted that the oxidized catalytic center contains a Cu(II) coordinated by two His ligands, one of which has a His-brace in which the His-1 terminal amine group also coordinates to a copper. The final equatorial position of the Cu(II) is occupied by a water-derived ligand. The spectroscopic characteristics of the truncated variant were not measurably different from those of full-length HjLPMO9A, indicating that the presence of the CBM1 module increases the affinity of HjLPMO9A for cellulose binding, but does not affect the active site.

https://openalex.org/W2756022759,"In the dryland Pacific Northwest wheat cropping systems, no-till is becoming more prevalent as a way to reduce soil erosion and fuel inputs. Tillage can have a profound effect on microbial communities and soilborne fungal pathogens, such as Rhizoctonia. We compared the fungal communities in long-term no-till (NT) plots adjacent to conventionally tilled (CT) plots, over three years at two locations in Washington state and one location in Idaho, US. We used pyrosequencing of the fungal ITS gene and identified 422 OTUs after rarefication. Fungal richness was higher in NT compared to CT, in two of the locations. Humicola nigrescens, Cryptococcus terreus, Cadophora spp. Hydnodontaceae spp., and Exophiala spp. were more abundant in NT, while species of Glarea, Coniochaetales, Mycosphaerella tassiana, Cryptococcus bhutanensis, Chaetomium perlucidum, and Ulocladium chartarum were more abundant in CT in most locations. Other abundant groups that did not show any trends were Fusarium, Mortierella, Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Macroventuria. Plant pathogens such as Rhizoctonia (Ceratobasidiaceae) were not abundant enough to see tillage differences, but Microdochium bolleyi, a weak root pathogen, was more abundant in NT. Our results suggest that NT fungi are better adapted at utilizing intact, decaying roots as a food source and may exist as root endophytes. CT fungi can utilize mature plant residues that are turned into the soil with tillage as pioneer colonizers, and then produce large numbers of conidia. But a larger proportion of the fungal community is not affected by tillage and may be niche generalists."
https://openalex.org/W2755195032,"Data on ESBL carriage of healthy people including children are scarce especially in developing countries. We analyzed the prevalence and genotypes of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (EPE) in Tanzanian street children with rare contact to healthcare facilities but significant interactions with the environment, animals and other people.Between April and July 2015, stool samples of 107 street children, who live in urban Mwanza were analyzed for EPE. Intestinal carriage of EPE was found in 34 (31.8%, 95% CI; 22.7-40.3) children. Of the 36 isolates from 34 children, 30 (83.3%) were Escherichia coli (E. coli) and six Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). Out of 36 isolates, 36 (100%), 35 (97%), 25 (69%) and 16 (44%) were resistant to tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, respectively. Beta-lactamase genes and the multilocus sequence types of E. coli and K. pneumoniae were characterized. ESBL gene blaCTX-M-15 was detected in 75% (27/36) of ESBL isolates. Sequence types (STs) 131, 10, 448 and 617 were the most prevalent in E. coli. Use of local herbs (OR: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.51-8.08, P = 0.003) and spending day and night on streets (OR: 3.6, 95% CI: 1.44-8.97, P = 0.005) were independent predictors of ESBL carriage.We observed a high prevalence of blaCTX-M-15 in EPE collected from street children in Tanzania. Detection of E. coli STs 131, 10, 38 and 648, which have been observed worldwide in animals and people, highlights the need for multidisciplinary approaches to understand the epidemiology and drivers of antimicrobial resistance in low-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W2754714613,"After wheat and rice, potato is the third most important staple food worldwide. A collection of ten tetraploid (Solanum tuberosum) and diploid (S. phureja and S. chacoense) genotypes with contrasting carotenoid content was subjected to molecular characterization with respect to candidate carotenoid loci and metabolic profiling using LC-HRMS. Irrespective of ploidy and taxonomy, tubers of these genotypes fell into three groups: yellow-fleshed, characterized by high levels of epoxy-xanthophylls and xanthophyll esters and by the presence of at least one copy of a dominant allele of the β-Carotene Hydroxylase 2 (CHY2) gene; white-fleshed, characterized by low carotenoid levels and by the presence of recessive chy2 alleles; and orange-fleshed, characterized by high levels of zeaxanthin but low levels of xanthophyll esters, and homozygosity for a Zeaxanthin Epoxidase (ZEP) recessive allele. Novel CHY2 and ZEP alleles were identified in the collection. Multivariate analysis identified several groups of co-regulated non-polar compounds, and resulted in the grouping of the genotypes according to flesh color, suggesting that extensive cross-talk exists between the carotenoid pathway and other metabolite pathways in tubers. Postharvest traits like tuber dormancy and weight loss during storage showed little correlation with tuber carotenoid content, with the exception of zeaxanthin and its esters. Other tuber metabolites, such as glucose, monogalactosyldiacyglycerol (a glycolipid), or suberin precursors, showed instead significant correlations with both traits."
https://openalex.org/W2755388401,"The ecological role of species can vary among populations depending on local and regional differences in diet. This is particularly true for top predators such as the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), which exhibits a highly varied diet throughout its distribution range. Local dietary assessments are therefore critical to fully understand the role of this species within marine ecosystems, as well as its interaction with important ecosystem services such as fisheries. Here, we combined stomach content analyses (SCA) and stable isotope analyses (SIA) to describe bottlenose dolphins diet in the Gulf of Cadiz (North Atlantic Ocean). Prey items identified using SCA included European conger (Conger conger) and European hake (Merluccius merluccius) as the most important ingested prey. However, mass-balance isotopic mixing model (MixSIAR), using δ13C and δ15N, indicated that the assimilated diet consisted mainly on Sparidae species (e.g. seabream, Diplodus annularis and D. bellottii, rubberlip grunt, Plectorhinchus mediterraneus, and common pandora, Pagellus erythrinus) and a mixture of other species including European hake, mackerels (Scomber colias, S. japonicus and S. scombrus), European conger, red bandfish (Cepola macrophthalma) and European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). These contrasting results highlight differences in the temporal and taxonomic resolution of each approach, but also point to potential differences between ingested (SCA) and assimilated (SIA) diets. Both approaches provide different insights, e.g. determination of consumed fish biomass for the management of fish stocks (SCA) or identification of important assimilated prey species to the consumer (SIA)."
https://openalex.org/W2754074945,"In elderly persons, weak tendons contribute to functional limitations, injuries, and disability, but re-sistance training can attenuate this age-related decline. We evaluated the effects of resistance training on the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the calcaneal tendon (CT) in young and old rats and its effect on tendon remodeling. Wistar rats aged 3 mo (young, n = 30) and 20 mo (old, n = 30) were divided into 4 groups: young sedentary, young trained, old sedentary (OS), and old trained (OT). The training sessions were conducted over a 12-wk period. Aging in sedentary rats showed down-regulation in key genes that regulated ECM remodeling. Moreover, the OS group showed a calcification focus in the distal region of the CT, with reduced blood vessel volume density. In contrast, resistance training was effective in up-regulating connective tissue growth factor, VEGF, and decorin gene expression in old rats. Resistance training also increased proteoglycan content in young and old rats in special small leucine-rich proteoglycans and blood vessels and prevented calcification in OT rats. These findings confirm that resistance training is a potential mechanism in the prevention of aging-related loss in ECM and that it attenuates the detrimental effects of aging in tendons, such as ruptures and tendinopathies.—Marqueti, R.

This positive feedback loop enables a very rapid and strong host response that, at some point, has to be controlled by negative regulators to maintain tissue homeostasis. Type I IFN signaling is controlled by the inducible negative regulators suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), SOCS3, and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18). The physiological role of these proteins in IFN-γ signaling has not been clarified. Here we used knockout cell lines and mice to show that IFN-λ signaling is regulated by SOCS1 but not by SOCS3 or USP18. These differences were the basis for the distinct kinetic properties of type I and III IFNs.

https://openalex.org/W2755583791,"IL-25, an IL-17 family cytokine, derived from epithelial cells was shown to regulate Th2- and Th9-type immune responses. We previously reported that IL-25 was important in promoting efficient protective immunity against T. spiralis infection; however, the cellular targets of IL-25 to elicit type-2 immunity during infection have not yet been addressed. Here, we investigated IL-25-responding cells and their involvement in mediating type-2 immune response during T. spiralis infection. ILC2 and CD4+ Th2 cells residing in the gastrointestinal tract of T. spiralis infected mice were found to express high levels of surface interleukin-17 receptor B (IL-17RB), a component of the IL-25 receptor. Following T. spiralis infection, activated ILC2s upregulated surface MHCII expression and enhanced capacity of effector T helper cell in producing antigen-specific Th2 and Th9 cytokines through MHCII-dependent interactions. Reciprocally, lack of CD4+ T helper cells impaired ILC2 function to produce type 2-associated cytokines in responding to IL-25 during T. spiralis infection. Furthermore, mice deficient in IL-17RB showed markedly reduced ILC2 numbers and antigen-specific Th2 and Th9 cytokine production during T. spiralis infection. The Il17rb-/- mice failed to mount effective antigen specific Th2 and Th9 functions resulting in diminished goblet cell and mast cell responses, leading to delayed worm expulsion in the intestines and muscles. Thus, our data indicated that ILC2s and CD4+ Th2 cells are the predominant cellular targets of IL-25 following T. spiralis infection and their collaborative interactions may play a key role in mounting effective antigen-specific Th2 and Th9 cytokine responses against T. spiralis infection."

Endometriosis pain is considered as a kind of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. However, whether P2X3 is involved in endometriosis pain has not been reported up to date. Here, we aimed to determine whether P2X3 expression in endometriotic lesions is involved in endometriosis pain, which is regulated by inflammatory mediators through extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signalling pathway. We found that P2X3 expressions in endometriosis endometrium and endometriotic lesions were both significantly higher as compared with control endometrium (P<0.05), and both positively correlated with pain (P<0.05). The expression levels of phosphorylated -ERK (p-ERK), phosphorylated-cAMP-response element binding protein (p-CREB), and P2X3 in endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs) were all significantly increased in comparison to the initial levels after treated with interleukin (IL)-1β (P<0.05) or adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (P<0.05), respectively, and did not increase after the ESCs were pre-treated with ERK1/2 inhibitor. Additionally, P2X3 and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) were co-expressed in endometriotic lesions. These obtained results suggest that P2X3 might be involved in endometriosis pain signal transduction via ERK signal pathway."

For this purpose, a total of 27 subjects was included in this study. Mean blur rate in tissue (MT) was measured in the ONH and in a PPR as well as relative flow volume (RFV) in retinal arteries (ART) and veins (VEIN) using LSFG. All participants performed isometric exercise for 6 minutes during which MT and mean arterial pressure were measured every minute. From these data OPP and pressure/flow curves were calculated. Isometric exercise increased OPP, MTONH and MTPRR. The relative increase in OPP (78.5 ± 19.8%) was more pronounced than the increase in BF parameters (MTONH: 18.1 ± 7.7%, MTPRR: 21.1 ± 8.3%, RFVART: 16.5 ±12.0%, RFVVEIN: 17.7 ± 12.4%) indicating for an autoregulatory response of the vasculature. The pressure/flow curves show that MTONH, MTPRR, RFVART, RFVVEIN started to increase at OPP levels of 51.2 ± 2.0%, 58.1 ± 2.4%, 45.6 ± 1.9% and 45.6 ± 1.9% above baseline. These data indicate that ONHBF starts to increase at levels of approx. 50% increase in OPP: This is slightly lower than the values we previously reported from LDF data. Signals from the PPR may have input from both, the retina and the choroid, but the relative contribution is unknown. In addition, retinal BF appears to increase at slightly lower OPP values of approximately 45%. LSFG may be used to study ONH autoregulation in diseases such as glaucoma.

Previous studies have shown that Sertoli and granulosa cells are derived from common progenitor cells and that differentiation of these two cell types is regulated by sex differentiation genes. The signaling pathway including the adhesion and transcription factor Ctnnb1 (cadherin-associated protein, β1, also known as β-catenin) regulates differentiation of granulosa cells in the absence of the transcription factor Sry, and overactivation of β-catenin in the presence of Sry leads to granulosa prior to sex determination. Surprisingly, our previous study found that β-catenin overactivation in Sertoli cells after sex determination can also cause disruption of the testicular cord and aberrant testis development. However, the underlying molecular mechanism was unclear. In this study, we found that constitutive activation of Ctnnb1 in Sertoli cells led to ectopic expression of the granulosa cell-specific marker FOXL2 in testes. Co-staining experiments revealed that FOXL2-positive cells were derived from Sertoli cells, and Sertoli cells were transformed into granulosa-like cells after Ctnnb1 overactivation. Further studies demonstrated that CTNNB1 induced Foxl2 expression by directly binding to transcription factor Tcf/Lef-binding sites in the FOXL2 promoter region. We also found that direct overexpression of Foxl2 decreased the expression of Sertoli cell-specific genes in primary Sertoli cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that repression of β-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling is required for lineage maintenance of Sertoli cells.

https://openalex.org/W2755342112,"Climate change indicators are tools to assess, visualize and communicate the impacts of climate change on species and communities. Indicators that can be applied to different taxa are particularly useful because they allow comparative analysis to identify which kinds of species are being more affected. A general prediction, supported by empirical data, is that the abundance of warm-adapted species should increase over time, relative to the cool-adapted ones within communities, under increasing ambient temperatures. The community temperature index (CTI) is a community weighted mean of species’ temperature preferences and has been used as an indicator to summarize this temporal shift. The CTI has the advantages of being a simple and generalizable indicator; however, a core problem is that temporal trends in the CTI may not only reflect changes in temperature. This is because species’ temperature preferences often covary with other species attributes, and these other attributes may affect species response to other environmental drivers. Here, we propose a novel model-based approach that separates the effects of temperature preference from the effects of other species attributes on species’ abundances and subsequently on the CTI. Using long-term population data of breeding birds in Denmark and demersal marine fish in the southeastern North Sea, we find differences in CTI trends with the original approach and our model-based approach, which may affect interpretation of climate change impacts. We suggest that our method can be used to test the robustness of CTI trends to the possible effects of other drivers of change, apart from climate change."

Hyperglycemia-related AGEs including methylglyoxal (MG), free methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone (MG-H1), and protein bound N-(Carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) and N-(Carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL) levels were measured in both SF and plasma samples using liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry methodology. The correlation between these AGEs and phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C34:3 (PC ae C34:3) and C36:3 (PC ae C36:3) were examined. Eighty four patients with knee OA, including 46 with DM and 38 without DM, were included in the study. There was no significant difference in plasma levels of MG, MG-H1, CML, and CEL between OA patients with and without DM. However, the levels of MG and MG-H1, but not CML and CEL in SF were significantly higher in OA patients with DM than in those without (all p ≤0.04). This association strengthened after adjustment for age, body mass index (BMI), sex and hexose level (p<0.02). Moreover, the levels of MG-H1 in SF was negatively and significantly correlated with PC ae C34:3 (ρ = -0.34; p = 0.02) and PC ae C36:3 (ρ = -0.39; P = 0.03) after the adjustment of age, BMI, sex and hexose level. Our data indicated that the production of non-protein bound AGEs was increased within the OA-affected joint of DM patients. This is associated with changes in phosphatidylcholine metabolism and might be responsible for the observed epidemiological association between OA and DM."

In this study, the de novo sequencing of total RNA produced 53.15 million reads covering 10.63 gigabases of transcriptome raw data in cadmium (Cd)-treated and untreated pokeweed. Of the 97,502 assembled unigenes, 42,197 had significant matches in a public database and were annotated accordingly. An expression level comparison between the samples revealed 1515 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 923 down- and 592 up-regulated under Cd treatment. A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs revealed that they were involved in 72 metabolism pathways, with photosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, ribosome, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms containing 24, 18, 72, 14, 7 and 15 genes, respectively. Genes related to heavy metal tolerance, absorption, transport and accumulation were also identified, including 11 expansins, 8 nicotianamine synthases, 6 aquaporins, 4 ZRT/IRT-like proteins, 3 ABC transporters and 3 metallothioneins. The gene expression results of 12 randomly selected DEGs were validated using quantitative real-time PCR, and showed different response patterns to Cd in their roots, stems and leaves. These results may be helpful in increasing our understanding of heavy metal hyperaccumulators and in future phytoremediation applications."

The in vivo MRI and ex vivo histological images were further processed to determine the frequencies and sizes of the iron deposits, and measure the number of HLMs in each deposit to estimate the in vivo MRI sensitivity for these cells. Hemosiderin accumulation is a macrophage biomarker and intrinsic contrast source for cellular MRI associated with the innate function of macrophages in iron metabolism systemically, and in metastatic cancer."

The objective of this study was to determine the chemical composition and evaluate the antioxidant and cytotoxic properties of Brazilian propolis from the species Plebeia droryana and Apis mellifera found in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. In the ethanolic extracts of P. droryana propolis (ExEP-P) and A. mellifera (ExEP-A) acids, phenolic compounds, terpenes and tocopherol were identified as major compounds. Both extracts presented antioxidant activity against the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical, the maximum activities being 500 μg/mL (ExEP-P) and 300 μg/mL (ExEP-A). However, only ExEP-A was able to inhibit lipid peroxidation induced by the oxidizing agent 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), which inhibited oxidative hemolysis and reduced the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in human erythrocytes for 4 h of incubation. The extracts also reduced the cell viability of the K562 erythroleukemia tumour line, with a predominance of necrotic death. Thus, it is concluded that the propolis produced by P. droryana and A. mellifera contain important compounds capable of minimizing the action of oxidizing substances in the organism and reducing the viability of erythroleukemia cells."

Studies on the replication dynamics of ZIKV are scarce, which limits the development of antiviral agents and vaccines directed against ZIKV. In this study, Aedes albopictus mosquito lineage cells (C6/36 cells) and African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero cells) were inoculated with a ZIKV sample isolated from a Brazilian patient, and the infection was characterized by immunofluorescence staining, phase contrast light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and real-time RT-PCR. The infection was observed in both cell lineages, and ZIKV particles were observed inside lysosomes, the rough endoplasmic reticulum and viroplasm-like structures. The susceptibility of C6/36 and Vero cells to ZIKV infection was demonstrated. Moreover, this study showed that part of the replicative cycle may occur within viroplasm-like structures, which has not been previously demonstrated in other flaviviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2755187658,"The expression of normal cellular prion protein (PrP) is required for the pathogenesis of prion diseases. However, the physiological functions of PrP remain ambiguous. Here, we identified PrP as being critical for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α-triggered signaling in a human melanoma cell line, M2, and a pancreatic ductal cell adenocarcinoma cell line, BxPC-3. In M2 cells, TNFα up-regulates the expression of p-IκB-kinase α/β (p-IKKα/β), p-p65, and p-JNK, but down-regulates the IκBα protein, all of which are downstream signaling intermediates in the TNF receptor signaling cascade. When PRNP is deleted in M2 cells, the effects of TNFα are no longer detectable. More importantly, p-p65 and p-JNK responses are restored when PRNP is reintroduced into the PRNP null cells. TNFα also activates NF-κB and increases TNFα production in wild-type M2 cells, but not in PrP-null M2 cells. Similar results are obtained in the BxPC-3 cells. Moreover, TNFα activation of NF-κB requires ubiquitination of receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIP1) and TNF receptor–associated factor 2 (TRAF2). TNFα treatment increases the binding between PrP and the deubiquitinase tumor suppressor cylindromatosis (CYLD), in these treated cells, binding of CYLD to RIP1 and TRAF2 is reduced. We conclude that PrP traps CYLD, preventing it from binding and deubiquitinating RIP1 and TRAF2. Our findings reveal that PrP enhances the responses to TNFα, promoting proinflammatory cytokine production, which may contribute to inflammation and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2755289999,"Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a serine/threonine protein kinase normally expressed in mitosis, is frequently up-regulated in multiple types of human tumors regardless of the cell cycle stage. However, the causal relationship between Plk1 up-regulation and tumorigenesis is incompletely investigated. To this end, using a conditional expression system, here we generated Plk1 transgenic mouse lines to examine the role of Plk1 in tumorigenesis. Plk1 overexpression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts prepared from the transgenic mice led to aberrant mitosis followed by aneuploidy and apoptosis. Surprisingly, Plk1 overexpression had no apparent phenotypes in the mice. Given that no malignant tumor formation was observed even after a long period of Plk1 overexpression, we reasoned that additional factors are required for tumorigenesis in Plk1-overexpressing mice. Because Plk1 can directly participate in the regulation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, we challenged Plk1-overexpressing mice with ionizing radiation (IR) and found that Plk1-overexpressing mice are much more sensitive to IR than their wild-type littermates. Analysis of tumor development in the Plk1-overexpressing mice indicated a marked decrease in the time required for tumor emergence after IR. At the molecular level, Plk1 overexpression led to reduced phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinases ATM and Chk2 and of histone H2AX after IR treatment both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, RNA-Seq analysis suggested that Plk1 elevation decreases the expression of several DDR genes. We conclude that Plk1 overexpression may contribute to tumor formation by both inducing chromosomal instability and suppressing the DDR pathway."

The prediction results are very close to the experimental data, and were also influenced by numbers of hidden neurons. The order of the solar generation power output influenced by the external conditions from smallest to biggest is: multi-, mono-, and amor- crystalline silicon cells. In addition, the dependences of power prediction on the number of hidden neurons were studied. For multi- and amorphous crystalline cell, three or four hidden layer units resulted in the high correlation coefficient and low MSEs. For mono-crystalline cell, the best results were achieved at the hidden layer unit of 8."
https://openalex.org/W2756356723,"Carbidopa is a drug that blocks conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside of central nervous system (CNS) and thus inhibits unwanted side effects of levodopa on organs located outside of CNS during management of Parkinson’s Disease (PD). PD is associated with increased expression of inflammatory genes in peripheral and central nervous system (CNS), infiltration of immune cells into brain, and increased numbers of activated/memory T cells. Animal models of PD have shown a critical role of T cells in inducing pathology in CNS. However, the effect of carbidopa on T cell responses in vivo is unknown. In this report, we show that carbidopa strongly inhibited T cell activation in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, carbidopa mitigated myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide fragment 35–55 (MOG-35-55) induced experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) and collagen induced arthritis in animal models. The data presented here suggest that in addition to blocking peripheral conversion of levodopa, carbidopa may inhibit T cell responses in PD individuals and implicate a potential therapeutic use of carbidopa in suppression of T cell mediated pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2755965538,"Several animal models have been used to understand the molecular basis of the pathogenicity, infectious dose and strain to strain variation of Listeria monocytogenes. The greater wax worm Galleria mellonella, as an alternative model, provides some useful advantages not available with other models and has already been described as suitable for the virulence assessment of various pathogens including L. monocytogenes. The objectives of this study are: 1) confirming the usefulness of this model with a wide panel of Listeria spp. including non-pathogenic L. innocua, L. seeligeri, L. welshimeri and animal pathogen L. ivanovii; 2) assessment of virulence of several isogenic in-frame deletion mutants in virulence and stress related genes of L. monocytogenes and 3) virulence assessment of paired food and clinical isolates of L. monocytogenes from 14 major listeriosis outbreaks occurred worldwide between 1980 and 2015. Larvae injected with different concentrations of Listeria were incubated at 37°C and monitored over seven days for time needed to kill 50% of larvae (LT50) and to determine change of bacterial population in G. mellonella, 2 and 24 hours post-inoculation. Non-pathogenic members of Listeria and L. ivanovii showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher LT50 (lower virulence) than the wild type L. monocytogenes strains. Isogenic mutants of L. monocytogenes with the deletions in prfA, plcA, hly, actA and virR genes, also showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher LT50 than the wild type strain at the inoculum of 106CFU/larva. Food isolates had significantly (P < 0.05) lower virulence than the paired clinical isolates, at all three inoculum concentrations. L. monocytogenes strains related to non-invasive (gastroenteritis) outbreaks of listeriosis showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower virulence than isolates of the same serotype obtained from outbreaks with invasive symptoms. The difference, however, was dose and strain- dependent. No significant differences in virulence were observed among the serotype tested in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2756316921,"Background Anemia, which has many etiologies, is a moderate/severe public health problem in young children and women of reproductive age in many developing countries. The aim of this study was to investigate prevalence of iron deficiency, anemia, and iron deficiency anemia using multiple biomarkers and to evaluate their association with food insecurity and food consumption patterns in non-pregnant women from a rural area of southern Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 202 rural women of reproductive age in southern Ethiopia. Anthropometrics and socio-demographic data were collected. A venipuncture blood sample was analyzed for hemoglobin (Hb) and for biomarkers of iron status. Biomarkers were skewed and were log transformed before analysis. Mean, median, Pearson’s correlations and ordinary least-squares regressions were calculated. Results Median (IQR) Hb was 138 (127, 151) g/L. Based on an altitude-adjusted (1708 m) cutoff of 125 g/L for Hb, 21.3% were anemic. Plasma ferritin was <15 μg/L in 18.6% of the women. Only one woman had α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) >1.0 g/L; four women (2%) had > 5 mg/L of C-reactive protein (CRP). Of the 43 women who were anemic, 23.3% (10 women) had depleted iron stores based on plasma ferritin. Three of these had elevated soluble transferrin receptors (sTfR). Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration was negatively correlated with sTfR (r = -0.24, p = 0.001), and positively correlated with ferritin (r = 0.17, p = 0.018), plasma iron (r = 0.15, p = 0.046), transferrin saturation (TfS) (r = 0.15, p = 0.04) and body iron (r = 0.14, p = 0.05). Overall prevalence of iron deficiency anemia was only 5%. Conclusion Iron deficiency anemia was not prevalent in the study population, despite the fact that anemia would be classified as a moderate public health problem."

The spindle plays a vital role in accurate chromosome segregation fidelity and is a therapeutic target in cancer. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which many spindle-associated proteins function remains unknown. The nucleolar and spindle-associated protein NUSAP1 is a microtubule-binding protein implicated in spindle stability and chromosome segregation. We show here that NUSAP1 localizes to dynamic spindle microtubules in a unique chromosome-centric pattern, in the vicinity of overlapping microtubules, during metaphase and anaphase of mitosis.

Together, these studies point to a crucial role for NUSAP1 is regulating both early and late mitotic events. Importantly, they strongly suggest that there exists a pool of microtubule-free NUSAP1 in early mitosis that could contribute to its function during cell division.

However, the role of NUSAP1 in mitosis remains largely unknown, as does the network of proteins to which it binds during cell division.

Finally, the kinetochore-associated microtubule motor CENP-E is SUMOylated, contributing to its kinetochore localization and function (27Zhang X.-D. Goeres J. Zhang H. Yen T.J. Porter A.C.

PIAS proteins are a family of conserved SUMO ligases involved in various aspects of cellular physiology, including cell cycle control. PIAS proteins contain an amino-terminal SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) domain that has been implicated in both enzyme activation and substrate targeting (28Liu Y. Zhang Y.-D. Guo L. Huang H.-Y. Zhu H. Huang J.-X. Zhou S.-R. Dang Y.-J. Li X. Tang Q.-Q. Protein inhibitor of activated STAT 1 (PIAS1) is identified as the SUMO E3 ligase of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) during adipogenesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 4606-4617Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Despite the significant size of the RanBP2–RanGAP1–UBC9 complex (RanBP2 has a predicted molecular mass of 358 kDa), it lacks a recognizable SAP domain. Notably, NUSAP1 has an obvious SAP domain in its amino terminus and we propose that NUSAP1 could facilitate RanBP2 ligase function through the amino-terminal SAP domain. NUSAP1 is a cell cycle-regulated, microtubule-binding protein whose expression has been shown previously, by us and others, to oscillate during the cell cycle (2Raemaekers T. Ribbeck K. Beaudouin J.

NuSAP is degraded by APC/C-Cdh1 and its overexpression results in mitotic arrest dependent of its microtubules' affinity.Cell Signal. 2007; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, experiments performed to date were done on relatively short time scales after synchronization and release, making it difficult to know if its dynamics were due to the effects of chemical synchronization. To analyze NUSAP1 protein dynamics throughout an entire cell cycle we performed immunoblots on U2OS cells synchronized using nocodazole, isolated by shake-off, and followed for 28 h after re-plating (Fig. 1A). NUSAP1 levels are elevated in mitotic cells compared with asynchronous populations, concomitant with an increase in phosphorylated histone H3 (Ser-10), a marker of mitosis. NUSAP1 levels decrease abruptly as cells enter G1 phase, consistent with degradation mediated by the APC/C. NUSAP1 levels remain low through early S phase, when Cyclin E is expressed and Cdh1 is degraded, and then begin to accumulate after the expression of Cyclin A, which marks the beginning of S phase. NUSAP1 is also targeted by another E3 ligase, the SCFCyclin-F, during S/G2 (9Emanuele M.J. Elia A.E. Xu Q. Thoma C.R. Izhar L. Leng Y. Guo A. Chen Y.-N. Rush J. Hsu P.W. Yen H.-C. Elledge S.J.

Interestingly, abundance of the APC/C co-activator Cdc20, Cyclin F, and NUSAP1 are all abruptly diminished at mitotic exit, consistent with their coordinated degradation by APC/C and its other co-activator, Cdh1 (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1) (30Choudhury R.

We used high-resolution immunofluorescent (IF) imaging to interrogate the localization of NUSAP1 during mitosis, when its protein levels are at their highest. The specificity of the NUSAP1 antibody was confirmed by comparing anti-NUSAP1-stained cells treated with either control siRNA targeting firefly luciferase (FF) or oligonucleotides targeting NUSAP1. RNAi depletion of NUSAP1 completely eliminated staining, confirming antibody specificity for IF. In prometaphase, NUSAP1 staining was diffuse and localization to specific mitotic structures was not apparent (supplemental Fig. S1). Later in mitosis NUSAP1 did not localize to the whole of the mitotic spindle, like the majority of known microtubule-binding proteins in mitosis (Fig. 1B). Instead, it localizes to the central spindle with the most concentrated area of NUSAP1 being near the chromatin (Fig. 1B). Highly concentrated NUSAP1 staining in the vicinity of chromatin was visible during metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, with the bulk of NUSAP1 appearing to localize to the spindles around chromatin. NUSAP1 localization is coincident with regions of anti-parallel, overlapping microtubules in the central spindle. Notably, this chromatin-centric spindle localization is highly unique among known microtubule-binding proteins in mitosis. Interestingly, it is comparable, although not identical, to PRC1 and KIF4, which also show increased microtubule binding after anaphase and control anti-parallel microtubule assemblies in the central spindle (10Ozlü N.

U.S.A. 2016; 113: 9430-9439Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This suggests that NUSAP1 represents a unique class of microtubule-binding protein that localize in the vicinity of inter-digitated microtubules and that tracks chromatin localization in both early and late mitosis. The localization of a pool of NUSAP1 on spindle microtubules near chromatin prompted us to determine whether NUSAP1 localization is microtubule dependent. Prior to fixation, cells were treated with either DMSO (control) or the microtubule depolymerizing drug nocodazole. NUSAP1 localization is lost when the spindle is depolymerized by nocodazole treatment, confirming that its localization it microtubule dependent (Fig. 1C). To determine which population of microtubules NUSAP1 localizes to, we depolymerized dynamic spindle microtubules prior to fixation (Fig. 1C). Cells were cold treated prior to fixation, which leads to the destabilization of microtubules that are not stably attached to kinetochores (k-fibers). NUSAP1 localization to the spindle was lost when non-kinetochore microtubules were depolymerized, suggesting that NUSAP1 localizes to dynamic microtubules during mitosis (Fig. 1C). This observation, and the diffuse NUSAP1 staining in prometaphase cells, is consistent with the notion that NUSAP1 binds to overlapping spindle microtubules. Finally, we analyzed single focal planes of NUSAP1 and tubulin staining by confocal microscopy. We observed NUSAP1 localization along microtubules, but not at the centromere, centrosome, or kinetochore (Fig. 1D). Together, these data confirm that NUSAP1 is cell cycle regulated, and demonstrate its chromatin-centric localization to dynamic microtubules during mitosis. NUSAP1 has a unique mitotic localization pattern compared with known microtubule-binding proteins (Fig. 1). Because NUSAP1 has been implicated in spindle stability and chromosome segregation we were interested in the mechanism by which NUSAP1 contributes to mitotic progression. To address this question, we analyzed protein interaction partners that bind NUSAP1 using endogenous NUSAP1 immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by protein identification using mass spectrometry (MS/MS). We performed IP experiments using control IgG and endogenous NUSAP1 antibodies in multiple cell lines (HeLa and HEK-293T). In addition, because NUSAP1 levels peak during mitosis (Fig. 1A) we also performed IPs from both asynchronous and mitotic HEK-293T cells arrested using nocodazole. By performing endogenous IPs in multiple cell lines and physiological conditions we sought to identify the strongest interactors that are most likely to be physiologically relevant in controlling mitotic progression. The total spectral counts (TSCs) for each interacting protein in each pulldown experiment are reported in supplemental Table S1. We filtered out nonspecific interactions identified in control IgG IPs, which were performed in parallel with each experiment, and removed known contaminants based on the CRAPome dataset (34Mellacheruvu D. Wright Z. Couzens A.L. Lambert J.-P. St-Denis N.A. Li T. Miteva Y.V. Hauri S. Sardiu M.E. Low T.Y. Halim V.A. Bagshaw R.D. Hubner N.C. Al-Hakim A. Bouchard A. et al.The CRAPome: a contaminant repository for affinity purification–mass spectrometry data.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). We then overlapped the remaining interactions between the three IPs to identify the highest-confidence set of NUSAP1-interacting proteins (Fig. 2A). This resulting list of 14 proteins included the known NUSAP1-interacting protein Importin-β (3Ribbeck K. Groen A.C. Santarella R. Bohnsack M.T. Raemaekers T. Köcher T. Gentzel M. Görlich D. Wilm M.

Cell. 2006; 17: 2646-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This analysis identified all three members of the RanBP2 mitotic SUMO E3 ligase complex, which includes RanBP2, RanGAP1, and the SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme UBC9. We identified multiple RanBP2 and RanGAP1 peptides in all three experiments. Despite the fact that NUSAP1 is more abundant in mitotic cells, the IPs were saturating in that we detected a similar number of NUSAP1 TSCs between asynchronous and mitotic 293T samples (supplemental Table S1). This allowed us to compare the relative number of RanBP2, RanGAP1, and Ubc9 TSCs between asynchronous and mitotic experiments. Our data show an enrichment of all three proteins in the mitotic sample relative to asynchronous cells, indicating that their interaction is cell cycle regulated (Fig. 2B). Further supporting an interaction between NUSAP1 and RanBP2, their binding was detected in a recent, large-scale interactome study using a tagged version of NUSAP1 (35Hutchins J.R. Toyoda Y.

Here, we aimed to understand the use of visual and olfactory information for bumblebees (Bombus terrestris terrestris L.) when seeking flowers in a visually complex background. To explore this issue, we first evaluated the effect of flower colour (red and blue), size (8, 16 and 32 mm), scent (presence or absence) and the amount of training on the foraging strategy of bumblebees (accuracy, search time and flight behaviour), considering the visual complexity of our background, to later explore whether experienced bumblebees, previously trained in the presence of scent, can recall and make use of odour information when foraging in the presence of novel visual stimuli carrying a familiar scent. Of all the variables analysed, flower colour had the strongest effect on the foraging strategy. Bumblebees searching for blue flowers were more accurate, flew faster, followed more direct paths between flowers and needed less time to find them, than bumblebees searching for red flowers. In turn, training and the presence of odour helped bees to find inconspicuous (red) flowers. When bees foraged on red flowers, search time increased with flower size; but search time was independent of flower size when bees foraged on blue flowers. Previous experience with floral scent enhances the capacity of detection of a novel colour carrying a familiar scent, probably by elemental association influencing attention."

https://openalex.org/W2756021788,"The genome sequence of V. cholerae O1 Biovar Eltor strain N16961 has revealed a putative antibiotic resistance (var) regulon that is predicted to encode a transcriptional activator (VarR), which is divergently transcribed relative to the putative resistance genes for both a metallo-β-lactamase (VarG) and an antibiotic efflux-pump (VarABCDEF). We sought to test whether these genes could confer antibiotic resistance and are organised as a regulon under the control of VarR. VarG was overexpressed and purified and shown to have β-lactamase activity against penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems, having the highest activity against meropenem. The expression of VarABCDEF in the Escherichia coli (ΔacrAB) strain KAM3 conferred resistance to a range of drugs, but most significant resistance was to the macrolide spiramycin. A gel-shift analysis was used to determine if VarR bound to the promoter regions of the resistance genes. Consistent with the regulation of these resistance genes, VarR binds to three distinct intergenic regions, varRG, varGA and varBC located upstream and adjacent to varG, varA and varC, respectively. VarR can act as a repressor at the varRG promoter region; whilst this repression was relieved upon addition of β-lactams, these did not dissociate the VarR/varRG-DNA complex, indicating that the de-repression of varR by β-lactams is indirect. Considering that the genomic arrangement of VarR-VarG is strikingly similar to that of AmpR-AmpC system, it is possible that V. cholerae has evolved a system for resistance to the newer β-lactams that would prove more beneficial to the bacterium in light of current selective pressures."

To do that, we evaluated cell proliferation of both epithelial and connective tissue cells in gingival wounds and found decreased of Ki67 nuclear staining in old rats when compared to their young counterparts. We next evaluated cellular responses of primary gingival fibroblast obtained from young subjects in the presence human blood serum of individuals of different ages. Eighteen to sixty five years old masculine donors were classified into 3 groups: ""young"" from 18 to 22 years old, ""middle-aged"" from 30 to 48 years old and ""aged"" over 50 years old. Cell proliferation, measured through immunofluorescence for Ki67 and flow cytometry for DNA content, was decreased when middle-aged and aged serum was added to gingival fibroblast compared to young serum. Myofibroblastic differentiation, measured through alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), was stimulated with young but not middle-aged or aged serum both the protein levels and incorporation of α-SMA into actin stress fibers. High levels of PDGF, VEGF, IL-6R were detected in blood serum from young subjects when compared to middle-aged and aged donors. In addition, the pro-inflammatory cytokines MCP-1 and TNF were increased in the serum of aged donors. In old rat wound there is an increased of staining for TNF compared to young wound. Moreover, healthy gingiva (non injury) shows less staining compared to a wound site, suggesting a role in wound healing. Moreover, serum from middle-aged and aged donors was able to stimulate cellular senescence in young cells as determined by the expression of senescence associated beta-galactosidase and histone H2A.X phosphorylated at Ser139. Moreover, we detected an increased frequency of γ-H2A.X-positive cells in aged rat gingival tissues. The present study suggests that serum factors present in middle-aged and aged individuals may be responsible, at least in part, for the altered responses observed during wound healing in aging."
https://openalex.org/W2755726786,"The sigma 1 receptor (S1R) is a unique transmembrane protein that has been shown to regulate neuronal differentiation and cellular survival. It is expressed within several cell types throughout the nervous system and visceral organs, including neurons and glia within the eye. S1R ligands are therapeutic targets for diseases ranging from neurodegenerative conditions to neoplastic disorders. However, effects of S1R activation and inhibition within glia cells are not well characterized. Within the eye, the astrocytes at the optic nerve head are crucial to the health and survival of the neurons that send visual information to the brain. In this study, we used the S1R-specific agonist, (+)-pentazocine, to evaluate S1R activation within optic nerve head-derived astrocytes (ONHAs). Treatment of ONHAs with (+)-pentazocine attenuated the level and duration of stress-induced ERK phosphorylation following oxidative stress exposure and promoted survival of ONHAs. These effects were specific to S1R activation because they were not observed in ONHAs that were depleted of S1R using siRNA-mediated knockdown. Collectively, our results suggest that S1R activation suppresses ERK1/2 phosphorylation and protects ONHAs from oxidative stress-induced death."

Methods A total of 37921 subjects with RVO were enrolled in the RVO group, and 113763 subjects without RVO were enrolled in the comparison group. The comparison group consisted of randomly selected individuals who were propensity score (PS)-matched with the RVO group at a ratio of 1:3, based on age, gender, obesity, stroke, hyperviscosity syndrome, glaucoma, and the use of antithrombotic drugs. A log-rank test was used to compare the cumulative hazard of AMI between the two groups. A multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of AMI, adjusted for PS, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure. Results The mean age of the cohort was 62.4±13.2 years. RVO patients had significantly higher proportions of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure than the comparisons. The mean follow-up period was 5.52 years in the RVO group and 5.55 years in the comparison group (p = 0.16). A log-rank test comparing the cumulative hazard curves of AMI for the two groups revealed a significant difference (p<0.0001). In the multivariate Cox regression after adjustment for PS and confounders, the RVO group had a significantly higher risk of AMI (adjusted HR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.30). When the RVO group was divided into central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and analyzed separately, both groups had significantly higher adjusted HRs for developing AMI than the comparison group. Moreover, the CRVO group had a significantly higher risk of AMI than the BRVO group. Conclusions People with RVO are at significantly greater risk of developing AMI than individuals without RVO."

Moreover, the effect of substituting sedentary behaviour with physical activity of different intensities on the body composition of children has received limited empirical study. Objective To examine the mathematical effects on Body Mass Index (BMI) of substituting sedentary behaviours with physical activities of different intensities on children and youth aged 5–14 years old in New Zealand. Methods Secondary analysis of accelerometer data from the National Survey of Children and Young People’s Physical Activity and Dietary Behaviours in New Zealand (2008/09) was conducted. A total of 1812 children and youth aged 5–24 years provided accelerometer-derived data on daily sedentary time (SB), light intensity physical activity (LPA) and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Sleep time was assessed with a validated computerised use-of-time tool. BMI was assessed using anthropometric measurements. Multiple linear regression models were used to examine the independent associations of SB, Sleep time, LPA, and MVPA on BMI. The isotemporal substitution approach was used to ascertain the mathematical effect of substituting each of the other behaviours on BMI. Analyses were stratified by age groups. Results SB showed a unique (inverse) association with BMI across all age groups (p<0.05) but 20–24 years (p>0.05). Similarly, MVPA was positively associated (p<0.001) across all age groups. Among age groups 5–9 years, 10–14 years and 15–19 years, the estimated impact of replacing 60 min/day of SB with the same amount of MVPA time resulted in decreased BMI for all age groups (p<0.001), ranging from -1.26 (5–9 years) to -1.43 units (15–19 years). Similar results were achieved when SB was replaced with LPA or sleeping time for children (5–19 years). In young people (age group 20–24), the impact of replacing 30 min/day of SB with MVPA resulted in an estimated -1 BMI units decrease (p<0.001). Conclusion MVPA and SB have a unique effect on BMI. Further, substituting SB with LPA or MVPA was associated with a favourable effect on BMI across all age groups; with MVPA having the strongest association."

Furthermore, PoO effects may vary across exposure levels (PoOxE effects). Such variation is the focus of this study. We upgraded the R-package Haplin to enable direct tests of PoOxE effects at the genome-wide level.

Data were analyzed for Europeans and Asians separately, and also for all ethnicities combined. To account for multiple testing, a false discovery rate method was used, where q-values were generated from the p-values. In the Europeans-only analyses, interactions with maternal smoking yielded the lowest q-values. Two SNPs in the ‘Interactor of little elongation complex ELL subunit 1’ (ICE1) gene had a q-value of 0.14, and five of the 20 most significant SNPs were in the ‘N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase-like 2’ (NAALADL2) gene. No evidence of PoOxE effects was found in the other analyses. The connections to ICE1 and NAALADL2 are novel and warrant further investigation. More generally, the new methodology presented here is easily applicable to other traits and exposures in which a family-based study design has been implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2756416714,"Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (Teil) initiates DNA demethylation by converting 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) at CpG-rich regions of genes, which have key roles in adult neurogenesis and memory. In addition, the overexpression of Tet1 with 5-hmC alteration in patients with psychosis has also been reported, for instance in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. The mechanism underlying Tet1 overexpression in the brain; however, is still elusive. In the present study, we found that Tet1-transgenic (Tet1-TG) mice displayed abnormal behaviors involving elevated anxiety and enhanced fear memories. We confirmed that Tet1 overexpression affected adult neurogenesis with oligodendrocyte differentiation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of Tet1-TG mice. In addition, Tet1 overexpression induced the elevated expression of immediate early genes, such as Egrl, c-fos, Arc, and Bdnf, followed by the activation of intracellular calcium signals (i.e., CamKII, ERK, and CREB) in prefrontal and hippocampal neurons. The expression of GABA receptor subunits (Gabra2 and Gabra4) fluctuated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. We evaluated the effects of Tet1 over-expression on intracellular calcium-dependent cascades by activating the Egrl promoter in vitro. Tet1 enhanced Egr1 expression, which may have led to alterations in Gabra2 and Gabra4 expression in neurons. Taken together, we suggest that the Tet1 overexpression in our Tet1-TG mice can be applied as an effective model for studying various stress-related diseases that show hyperactivation of intracellular calcium-dependent cascades in the brain.—Kwon, W., Kim, H.-S., Jeong J., Sung, Y., Choi, M., Park, S., Lee, J., Jang S., Kim, S. H., Lee, S., Kim, M. O., Ryoo, Z. Y. Tet1 overexpression leads to anxiety-like behavior and enhanced fear memories via the activation of calcium-dependent cascade through Egr1 expression in mice.

https://openalex.org/W2756357954,"E1784K is the most common mixed long QT syndrome/Brugada syndrome mutant in the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.5. E1784K shifts the midpoint of the channel conductance-voltage relationship to more depolarized membrane potentials and accelerates the rate of channel fast inactivation. The depolarizing shift in the midpoint of the conductance curve in E1784K is exacerbated by low extracellular pH. We tested whether the E1784K mutant shifts the channel conductance curve to more depolarized membrane potentials by affecting the channel voltage-sensors. We measured ionic currents and gating currents at pH 7.4 and pH 6.0 in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Contrary to our expectation, the movement of gating charges is shifted to more hyperpolarized membrane potentials by E1784K. Voltage-clamp fluorimetry experiments show that this gating charge shift is due to the movement of the DIVS4 voltage-sensor being shifted to more hyperpolarized membrane potentials. Using a model and experiments on fast inactivation-deficient channels, we show that changes to the rate and voltage-dependence of fast inactivation are sufficient to shift the conductance curve in E1784K. Our results localize the effects of E1784K to DIVS4, and provide novel insight into the role of the DIV-VSD in regulating the voltage-dependencies of activation and fast inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2754522390,"Interleukin 33 (IL-33), an inflammatory and mechanically responsive cytokine, is an important component of a TLR4-dependent innate immune process in mucosal epithelium. Although TLR4 also plays a role in sensing biomechanical stretch, a pathway of stretch-induced TLR4-dependent IL-33 biosynthesis has not been revealed. In the current study, we show that short term (6 h) cyclic stretch (CS) of cultured murine respiratory epithelial cells (MLE-12) increased intracellular IL-33 expression in a TLR4 dependent fashion. There was no detectable IL-33 in conditioned media in this interval. CS, however, increased release of the notable alarmin, HMGB1, and a neutralizing antibody (2G7) to HMGB1 completely abolished the CS mediated increase in IL-33. rHMGB1 increased IL-33 synthesis and this was partially abrogated by silencing TLR4 suggesting additional receptors for HMGB1 are involved in its regulation of IL-33. Collectively, these data reveal a HMGB1/TLR4/IL-33 pathway in the response of respiratory epithelium to mechanical stretch."
https://openalex.org/W2754116403,"Climate change and excess deposition of airborne nitrogen (N) are among the main stressors to floristic biodiversity. One particular concern is the deterioration of valuable habitats such as those protected under the European Habitat Directive. In future, climate-driven shifts (and losses) in the species potential distribution, but also N driven nutrient enrichment may threaten these habitats. We applied a dynamic geochemical soil model (VSD+) together with a novel niche-based plant response model (PROPS) to 5 forest habitat types (18 forest sites) protected under the EU Directive in Austria. We assessed how future climate change and N deposition might affect habitat suitability, defined as the capacity of a site to host its typical plant species. Our evaluation indicates that climate change will be the main driver of a decrease in habitat suitability in the future in Austria. The expected climate change will increase the occurrence of thermophilic plant species while decreasing cold-tolerant species. In addition to these direct impacts, climate change scenarios caused an increase of the occurrence probability of oligotrophic species due to a higher N immobilisation in woody biomass leading to soil N depletion. As a consequence, climate change did offset eutrophication from N deposition, even when no further reduction in N emissions was assumed. Our results show that climate change may have positive side-effects in forest habitats when multiple drivers of change are considered."
https://openalex.org/W2755997673,"High risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection in males is a health issue with implications for HPV-related lesions in their partners. The identification of risk factors for male infection may improve our understanding of HR-HPV transmission and prevention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships between lifestyle, genital warts and HR-HPV infection. The study was focused on men with an increased risk of HR-HPV infection: male sexual partners of women diagnosed with high-grade squamous intraepithelial cervical lesions.Men were enrolled and prospectively recruited within the first six months after diagnosis of cervical lesions in their female partners (n = 175, 2013-2016). Epidemiological and sexual behaviour data were obtained. The presence of genital warts was established by visual inspection. Detection and genotyping of HR-HPV infection in genital samples were performed with a Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test. All HR-HPV positive men were offered a follow-up exam at 12 months. SPSS version 19 was used for statistical analysis.The prevalence of HR-HPV infection in men was 45.1% (79/175). Genital warts were observed in 10.3% (18/175) of the subjects. Detection of genital warts (OR 3.5, p = 0.015), smoking habits (OR 2.3, p = 0.006) and sexual debut before 16 years old (OR 2, p = 0.035) were associated with an increased risk for HR-HPV infection (univariate analysis). This association was also observed for genital warts and smoking status in a multivariate analysis. The same genotype was found after one year in 71.4% (20/28) of subjects.The presence of genital warts and smoking habits seem to be associated with a higher risk of HR-HPV infection in males. Earlier sexual debut may increase this risk. Extensive knowledge of the natural history of HR-HPV infection in males is an absolute requirement for the design and implementation of prevention strategies for the general population as well as for specific populations such as couples after treatment for high-grade cervical lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2755098840,"This study aims to examine the association of breast cancer with dietary patterns among Chinese women. A population-based case-control study was conducted in Jiangsu, China. Newly diagnosed primary breast cancer patients were recruited as cases (n = 818). Controls (n = 935), selected from the general population, were frequency matched to cases. A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary intake. Dietary patterns were identified by factor analysis and multivariable odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Four dietary patterns were identified: salty, vegetarian, sweet and traditional Chinese. The traditional Chinese pattern was found to be robustly associated with a lower risk of breast cancer among both pre- and post-menopausal women (4th vs. 1st quartile: OR for pre- and post-menopausal women was 0.47 and 0.68, respectively). Women with high factor scores of the sweet pattern also showed a decreased risk of breast cancer (4th vs. 1st quartile: OR for pre- and post-menopausal women was 0.47 and 0.68, respectively). No marked association was observed between a vegetarian pattern or a salty pattern and breast cancer. These findings indicate that dietary patterns of the traditional Chinese and the sweet may favorably associate with the risk of breast cancer among Chinese women."
https://openalex.org/W2755250027,"Causal illusions occur when people perceive a causal relation between two events that are actually unrelated. One factor that has been shown to promote these mistaken beliefs is the outcome probability. Thus, people tend to overestimate the strength of a causal relation when the potential consequence (i.e. the outcome) occurs with a high probability (outcome-density bias). Given that children and adults differ in several important features involved in causal judgment, including prior knowledge and basic cognitive skills, developmental studies can be considered an outstanding approach to detect and further explore the psychological processes and mechanisms underlying this bias. However, the outcome density bias has been mainly explored in adulthood, and no previous evidence for this bias has been reported in children. Thus, the purpose of this study was to extend outcome-density bias research to childhood. In two experiments, children between 6 and 8 years old were exposed to two similar setups, both showing a non-contingent relation between the potential cause and the outcome. These two scenarios differed only in the probability of the outcome, which could either be high or low. Children judged the relation between the two events to be stronger in the high probability of the outcome setting, revealing that, like adults, they develop causal illusions when the outcome is frequent."
https://openalex.org/W2755386543,"Background Studies around the world have shown that interactions between pharmaceutical companies, pharmacists and physicians have a great influence on prescribing and drug dispensing practices. In middle-income countries, the nature and extent of these interactions have not been well researched. Our objectives were to qualitatively explore the nature of the interactions between pharmaceutical companies, physicians and pharmacists, their impact on drug prescription and dispensing practices in Lebanon. Methods and findings We used grounded theory approach as well as the known sponsor, purposive, and snowballing sampling strategies to identify interviewees from the three respective groups: physicians, pharmacists, and pharmaceutical representatives. We conducted semi-structured and analyzed transcripts thematically. This study encompassed 6 pharmaceutical representatives, 13 physicians and 13 pharmacists. The following themes emerged: purpose and driver for the interactions, nature of the interactions, incentives, impact on prescription practices, ethical considerations, and suggestions for managing the interactions. The main purposes for the interaction were educational, promotional, and monitoring prescription practices and dispensing, while the main drivers for these interactions were market potential and neighborhood socio-economic status. Physicians, pharmacists and pharmaceutical representatives who engage in these interactions benefit from a variety of incentives, some of which were characterized as unethical. It appears that pharmaceutical companies give prominence to selected physicians within their communities. Although members of the three interviewed groups refer to some of the interactions as being problematic, they described a culture of acceptance of gift giving. We developed a framework that depicts the prevailing politico-cultural environment, the interactions between the three professional groups, and their impact on drug prescription. Underreporting is the main limitation of this study. Conclusion Interactions between physicians, pharmacists and pharmaceutical representatives are frequent. Although these interactions can be beneficial, they still have a substantial effect on drug prescription and dispensing practices. Hence, the need for new policies that regulate these interactions and penalize any misconduct."
https://openalex.org/W2755303620,"Annotating the genotype-phenotype relationship, and developing a proper quantitative description of the relationship, requires understanding the impact of natural genomic variation on gene expression. We apply a sequence-level model of gap gene expression in the early development of Drosophila to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a panel of natural sequenced D. melanogaster lines. Using a thermodynamic modeling framework, we provide both analytical and computational descriptions of how single-nucleotide variants affect gene expression. The analysis reveals that the sequence variants increase (decrease) gene expression if located within binding sites of repressors (activators). We show that the sign of SNP influence (activation or repression) may change in time and space and elucidate the origin of this change in specific examples. The thermodynamic modeling approach predicts non-local and non-linear effects arising from SNPs, and combinations of SNPs, in individual fly genotypes. Simulation of individual fly genotypes using our model reveals that this non-linearity reduces to almost additive inputs from multiple SNPs. Further, we see signatures of the action of purifying selection in the gap gene regulatory regions. To infer the specific targets of purifying selection, we analyze the patterns of polymorphism in the data at two phenotypic levels: the strengths of binding and expression. We find that combinations of SNPs show evidence of being under selective pressure, while individual SNPs do not. The model predicts that SNPs appear to accumulate in the genotypes of the natural population in a way biased towards small increases in activating action on the expression pattern. Taken together, these results provide a systems-level view of how genetic variation translates to the level of gene regulatory networks via combinatorial SNP effects."
https://openalex.org/W2754584788,"Liver myofibroblasts are specialized effector cells that drive hepatic fibrosis, a hallmark process of chronic liver diseases, leading to progressive scar formation and organ failure. Liver myofibroblasts are increasingly recognized as heterogeneous with regards to their origin, phenotype, and functions. For instance, liver myofibroblasts express cell markers that are universally represented such as, ItgαV and Pdgfrβ, or restricted to a given subpopulation such as, Lrat exclusively expressed in hepatic stellate cells, and Gpm6a in mesothelial cells. To study liver myofibroblasts in vitro, we have previously generated and characterized a SV40-immortalized polyclonal rat activated portal fibroblast cell line called RGF-N2 expressing multiple mesothelin mRNA transcripts. Mesothelin, a cell-surface molecule expressed in normal mesothelial cells and overexpressed in several cancers such as, mesothelioma and cholangiocarcinoma, was recently identified as a key regulator of portal myofibroblast proliferation, and fibrosis progression in the setting of chronic cholestatic liver disease. Here, we identify novel mesothelin splice variants expressed in rat activated portal fibroblasts. RGF-N2 portal fibroblast cDNA was used as template for insertion of hemagglutinin tag consensus sequence into the complete open reading frame of rat mesothelin variant coding sequences by extension PCR. Purified amplicons were subsequently cloned into an expression vector for in vitro translation and transfection in monkey COS7 fibroblasts, before characterization of fusion proteins by immunoblot and immunofluorescence. We show that rat activated portal fibroblasts, hepatic stellate cells, and cholangiocarcinoma cells express wild-type mesothelin and additional splice variants, while mouse activated hepatic stellate cells appear to only express wild-type mesothelin. Notably, rat mesothelin splice variants differ from the wild-type isoform by their protein properties and cellular distribution in transfected COS7 fibroblasts. We conclude that mesothelin is a marker of activated murine liver myofibroblasts. Mesothelin gene expression and regulation may be critical in liver myofibroblasts functions and fibrosis progression."
https://openalex.org/W2754599012,"Paclitaxel plays a central role in chemotherapy for breast cancer. Peripheral neuropathy, a well-known toxicity with paclitaxel, may be of interest in predicting the efficacy of paclitaxel therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer. We performed a retrospective analysis assessing whether the early occurrence of peripheral neuropathy (EPN) was a predictive marker for better efficacy in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy containing paclitaxel.Between January 2000 and August 2008, we examined the records of 168 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with paclitaxel in our hospital. EPN was defined as a symptom of Grade 2 or more during first three months of treatment. The overall response rate (ORR) and time to treatment failure (TTF) in each group were analyzed retrospectively.Of 168 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with paclitaxel, EPN was documented in 101 patients (60.1%). The clinical benefit rate (CR, PR, and SD ≥ 6 months) was 72.3% in the EPN group and 49.3% in the non-EPN group (p = 0.002). The TTF of the EPN group (median 11.2 months, 95% CI: 9.5-12.9) was significantly longer than that of the non-EPN group (5.7 months, 95% CI: 4.6-6.8) (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that EPN (p<0.001), dose intensity of less than 70% (p<0.001), and the history of microtubule agents (p = 0.001) were the significant favorable prognostic factors for TTF.The early onset of peripheral neuropathy might be a robust predictor for TTF in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with paclitaxel."

By systematically imaging immobilized spirochetes with increasing tapping forces, we found that mutants that lack PFs are more readily compressed and damaged by the imaging process compared to wild-type cells. This finding suggest that the PFs, aside from being essential for motility and involved in cell shape, play a cytoskeletal role in dissipating energy and maintaining cellular integrity in the presence of external stress."
https://openalex.org/W2756457695,"Retinal ganglion cells (RGC) have been described to react to light stimuli either by producing short bursts of spikes or by maintaining a longer, continuous train of action potentials. Fast, quickly decaying responses are considered to be transient in nature and encode information about movement and direction, while cell responses that show a slow, drawn-out response fall into the sustained category and are thought to be responsible for carrying information related to color and contrast. Multiple approaches have been introduced thus far to measure and determine response transiency. In this study, we adopted and slightly modified a method described by Zeck and Masland to characterize RGC response transiency values and compare them to those obtained by alternative methods. As the first step, RGC spike responses were elicited by light stimulation and peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) were generated. PSTHs then were used to calculate the time constant (PSTHτ approach). We show that this method is comparable to or more reliable than alternative approaches to describe the temporal characteristics of RGC light responses. In addition, we also show that PSTHτ-s are compatible with time constants measured on RGC and/or bipolar cell graded potentials; thus they are suitable for studying signaling through parallel retinal pathways."
