https://openalex.org/W3160449499,"COVID-19 manifests with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes that are characterized by exaggerated and misdirected host immune responses1–6. Although pathological innate immune activation is well-documented in severe disease1, the effect of autoantibodies on disease progression is less well-defined. Here we use a high-throughput autoantibody discovery technique known as rapid extracellular antigen profiling7 to screen a cohort of 194 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, comprising 172 patients with COVID-19 and 22 healthcare workers with mild disease or asymptomatic infection, for autoantibodies against 2,770 extracellular and secreted proteins (members of the exoproteome). We found that patients with COVID-19 exhibit marked increases in autoantibody reactivities as compared to uninfected individuals, and show a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins (including cytokines, chemokines, complement components and cell-surface proteins). We established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signalling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that mouse surrogates of these autoantibodies increase disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our analysis of autoantibodies against tissue-associated antigens revealed associations with specific clinical characteristics. Our findings suggest a pathological role for exoproteome-directed autoantibodies in COVID-19, with diverse effects on immune functionality and associations with clinical outcomes. Rapid extracellular antigen profiling of a cohort of 194 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 uncovers diverse autoantibody responses that affect COVID-19 disease severity, progression and clinical and immunological characteristics."

https://openalex.org/W3161540890,"When intense lightwaves accelerate electrons through a solid, the emerging high-order harmonic (HH) radiation offers key insights into the material1-11. Sub-optical-cycle dynamics-such as dynamical Bloch oscillations2-5, quasiparticle collisions6,12, valley pseudospin switching13 and heating of Dirac gases10-leave fingerprints in the HH spectra of conventional solids. Topologically non-trivial matter14,15 with invariants that are robust against imperfections has been predicted to support unconventional HH generation16-20. Here we experimentally demonstrate HH generation in a three-dimensional topological insulator-bismuth telluride. The frequency of the terahertz driving field sharply discriminates between HH generation from the bulk and from the topological surface, where the unique combination of long scattering times owing to spin-momentum locking17 and the quasi-relativistic dispersion enables unusually efficient HH generation. Intriguingly, all observed orders can be continuously shifted to arbitrary non-integer multiples of the driving frequency by varying the carrier-envelope phase of the driving field-in line with quantum theory. The anomalous Berry curvature warranted by the non-trivial topology enforces meandering ballistic trajectories of the Dirac fermions, causing a hallmark polarization pattern of the HH emission. Our study provides a platform to explore topology and relativistic quantum physics in strong-field control, and could lead to non-dissipative topological electronics at infrared frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W3161357132,"Public parks serve an important societal function as recreational spaces for diverse communities of people, with well documented physical and mental health benefits. As such, parks may be crucial for how people have handled effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the increasingly limited recreational opportunities, widespread financial uncertainty, and consequent heightened anxiety. Despite the documented benefits of parks, however, many states have instituted park shutdown orders due to fears that public parks could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we use geotagged social media data from state, county, and local parks throughout New Jersey to examine whether park visitation increased when the COVID-19 pandemic began and whether park shutdown orders were effective at deterring park usage. We compare park usage during four discrete stages of spring 2020: (1) before the pandemic began, (2) during the beginning of the pandemic, (3) during the New Jersey governor’s state-wide park shutdown order, and (4) following the lifting of the shutdown. We find that park visitation increased by 63.4% with the onset of the pandemic. The subsequent park shutdown order caused visitation in closed parks to decline by 76.1% while parks that remained open continued to experience elevated visitation levels. Visitation then returned to elevated pre-shutdown levels when closed parks were allowed to reopen. Altogether, our results indicate that parks continue to provide crucial services to society, particularly in stressful times when opportunities for recreation are limited. Furthermore, our results suggest that policies targeting human behavior can be effective and are largely reversible. As such, we should continue to invest in public parks and to explore the role of parks in managing public health and psychological well-being."
https://openalex.org/W3163576401,"Forest fires are usually viewed within the context of a single fire season, in which weather conditions and fuel supply can combine to create conditions favourable for fire ignition—usually by lightning or human activity—and spread1–3. But some fires exhibit ‘overwintering’ behaviour, in which they smoulder through the non-fire season and flare up in the subsequent spring4,5. In boreal (northern) forests, deep organic soils favourable for smouldering6, along with accelerated climate warming7, may present unusually favourable conditions for overwintering. However, the extent of overwintering in boreal forests and the underlying factors influencing this behaviour remain unclear. Here we show that overwintering fires in boreal forests are associated with hot summers generating large fire years and deep burning into organic soils, conditions that have become more frequent in our study areas in recent decades. Our results are based on an algorithm with which we detect overwintering fires in Alaska, USA, and the Northwest Territories, Canada, using field and remote sensing datasets. Between 2002 and 2018, overwintering fires were responsible for 0.8 per cent of the total burned area; however, in one year this amounted to 38 per cent. The spatiotemporal predictability of overwintering fires could be used by fire management agencies to facilitate early detection, which may result in reduced carbon emissions and firefighting costs. Large forest fires in Alaska and the Northwest Territories can ‘overwinter’ and then reignite in the following fire season, contributing up to one-third of the burned area in individual years."
https://openalex.org/W3163564100,"Chemical reactions represent a class of quantum problems that challenge both the current theoretical understanding and computational capabilities1. Reactions that occur at ultralow temperatures provide an ideal testing ground for quantum chemistry and scattering theories, because they can be experimentally studied with unprecedented control2, yet display dynamics that are highly complex3. Here we report the full product state distribution for the reaction 2KRb → K2 + Rb2. Ultracold preparation of the reactants allows us complete control over their initial quantum degrees of freedom, whereas state-resolved, coincident detection of both products enables the probability of scattering into each of the 57 allowed rotational state-pairs to be measured. Our results show an overall agreement with a state-counting model based on statistical theory4-6, but also reveal several deviating state-pairs. In particular, we observe a strong suppression of population in the state-pair closest to the exoergicity limit as a result of the long-range potential inhibiting the escape of products. The completeness of our measurements provides a benchmark for quantum dynamics calculations beyond the current state of the art."
https://openalex.org/W3157704466,"Defining long-term protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is one of the most pressing questions of our time and will require a detailed understanding of potential ways this virus can evolve to escape immune protection. Immune protection will most likely be mediated by antibodies that bind to the viral entry protein, spike (S). Here, we used Phage-DMS, an approach that comprehensively interrogates the effect of all possible mutations on binding to a protein of interest, to define the profile of antibody escape to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein using coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma. Antibody binding was common in two regions, the fusion peptide and the linker region upstream of the heptad repeat region 2. However, escape mutations were variable within these immunodominant regions. There was also individual variation in less commonly targeted epitopes. This study provides a granular view of potential antibody escape pathways and suggests there will be individual variation in antibody-mediated virus evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3161868396,"Coronatine and related bacterial phytotoxins are mimics of the hormone jasmonyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile), which mediates physiologically important plant signalling pathways1–4. Coronatine-like phytotoxins disrupt these essential pathways and have potential in the development of safer, more selective herbicides. Although the biosynthesis of coronatine has been investigated previously, the nature of the enzyme that catalyses the crucial coupling of coronafacic acid to amino acids remains unknown1,2. Here we characterize a family of enzymes, coronafacic acid ligases (CfaLs), and resolve their structures. We found that CfaL can also produce JA-Ile, despite low similarity with the Jar1 enzyme that is responsible for ligation of JA and l-Ile in plants5. This suggests that Jar1 and CfaL evolved independently to catalyse similar reactions—Jar1 producing a compound essential for plant development4,5, and the bacterial ligases producing analogues toxic to plants. We further demonstrate how CfaL enzymes can be used to synthesize a diverse array of amides, obviating the need for protecting groups. Highly selective kinetic resolutions of racemic donor or acceptor substrates were achieved, affording homochiral products. We also used structure-guided mutagenesis to engineer improved CfaL variants. Together, these results show that CfaLs can deliver a wide range of amides for agrochemical, pharmaceutical and other applications. A family of enzymes—coronafacic acid ligases, involved in the synthesis of bacterial phytotoxins—are found to catalyse amide bond formation with a wide range of substrates."
https://openalex.org/W3162870289,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on the lives of people around the world and could be a risk factor for mental health diseases. This study aimed to explore the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by identifying patterns related to post-traumatic symptoms by considering personality and defensive styles. Specifically, it was hypothesized that neuroticism was negatively associated with impact of event, as opposed to extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness traits. The mediation role of mature, neurotic, and immature defenses in these relationships was also investigated. This study involved 557 Italian individuals (71.3% women, 28.7% men; M age = 34.65, SD = 12.05), who completed an online survey including the Impact of Event Scale—Revised, Forty Item Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40) and Ten Item Personality Inventory. Results showed a nonsignificant effect for extraversion and openness on impact of event. The negative influence of neuroticism was instead confirmed in a partial parallel mediation involving significant effects from immature and neurotic defenses in the indirect path. Finally, agreeableness and conscientiousness delineated two protective pathways regarding impact of event, determining two total parallel mediation models in which both these personality traits were negatively associated with immature defensive styles, and conscientiousness was also positively related to mature defenses. These findings provide an exploration post-traumatic symptom patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, involving the big five personality traits and defense mechanisms. These results may be useful for developing interventions, treatments, and prevention activities."
https://openalex.org/W3160196568,"Fibrin has been used clinically for wound coverings, surgical glues, and cell delivery because of its affordability, cytocompatibility, and ability to modulate angiogenesis and inflammation. However, its rapid degradation rate has limited its usefulness as a scaffold for 3D cell culture and tissue engineering. Previous studies have sought to slow the degradation rate of fibrin with the addition of proteolysis inhibitors or synthetic crosslinkers that require multiple functionalization or polymerization steps. These strategies are difficult to implement in vivo and introduce increased complexity, both of which hinder the use of fibrin in research and medicine. Previously, we demonstrated that additional crosslinking of fibrin gels using bifunctionalized poly(ethylene glycol)-n-hydroxysuccinimide (PEG-NHS) slows the degradation rate of fibrin. In this study, we aimed to further improve the longevity of these PEG-fibrin gels such that they could be used for tissue engineering in vitro or in situ without the need for proteolysis inhibitors. It is well documented that increasing the salinity of fibrin precursor solutions affects the resulting gel morphology. Here, we investigated whether this altered morphology influences the fibrin degradation rate. Increasing the final sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration from 145 mM (physiologic level) to 250 mM resulted in fine, transparent high-salt (HS) fibrin gels that degrade 2–3 times slower than coarse, opaque physiologic-salt (PS) fibrin gels both in vitro (when treated with proteases and when seeded with amniotic fluid stem cells) and in vivo (when injected subcutaneously into mice). Increased salt concentrations did not affect the viability of encapsulated cells, the ability of encapsulated endothelial cells to form rudimentary capillary networks, or the ability of the gels to maintain induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, when implanted subcutaneously, PS gels degraded completely within one week while HS gels remained stable and maintained viability of seeded dermal fibroblasts. To our knowledge, this is the simplest method reported for the fabrication of fibrin gels with tunable degradation properties and will be useful for implementing fibrin gels in a wide range of research and clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W3163234319,"NF1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the major cause of mortality in neurofibromatosis. MPNSTs arise from benign peripheral nerve plexiform neurofibromas that originate in the embryonic neural crest cell lineage. Using reporter transgenes that label early neural crest lineage cells in multiple NF1 MPNST mouse models, we discover and characterize a rare MPNST cell population with stem-cell-like properties, including quiescence, that is essential for tumor initiation and relapse. Following isolation of these cells, we derive a cancer-stem-cell-specific gene expression signature that includes consensus embryonic neural crest genes and identify Nestin as a marker for the MPNST cell of origin. Combined targeting of cancer stem cells along with antimitotic chemotherapy yields effective tumor inhibition and prolongs survival. Enrichment of the cancer stem cell signature in cognate human tumors supports the generality and relevance of cancer stem cells to MPNST therapy development."
https://openalex.org/W3162436093,"Dynamic changes in flavonoid, total phenol, and antioxidant potential in different Prunus humilis accessions during fruit development stages were studied in order to provide a reference for the optimum harvest time for flavonoid extraction. 'Nongda 4', 'Nongda 5', 'DS-1' and '02-16' were selected as plant materials to determine the content of flavonoid, total phenol and antioxidant indices during six fruit development stages. Changes in total flavonoid content (TFC) and total phenol content (TPC) in different accessions of P. humilis were slightly different depending on the development stage of P. humilis fruit. TFC and TPC in 'Nongda 5' fruit showed a trend of continuous decline. There was a small increase in TFC and TPC from the young fruit stage to the stone hardening stage, followed by a decreasing trend, and then to the lowest level at the ripening stage of 'Nongda 4', 'DS-1', and '02-16' fruits. The trend of antioxidant capacity (ABTS, FRAP, DPPH) with the TFC and TPC of P. humilis fruit was basically the same, and the correlation analysis results showed that the TFC of P. humilis fruit was positively correlated with the antioxidant indices (P<0.01). Catechin (CC), rutin (RT), and quercetin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (Q7G) were detected in all the fruit development stages of the four P. humilis fruits. Among them, catechin was the most abundant component, accounting for approximately 10%. Myricetin (MC) and quercetin (QC) were generally detected only in the early fruit development stage, but not in the later fruit development stage. Correlation analysis showed that the flavonoid components with TFC, TPC, and antioxidant indices differed between the different accessions. RT, CC, and liquiritigenin (LR) had a stronger correlation with TFC and antioxidant indices. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) was not detected until the coloring stage in two red P. humilis accessions ('Nongda 4' and 'DS-1'), and so it is better to choose a red P. humilis fruit to extract C3G at the ripening stage. Selecting an early stage of fruit development, especially the stone hardening stage, was important for extracting flavonoids, total phenols and other components. We believe that our results will provide basic information and reference for evaluation of fruit nutrition and health benefits, breeding of functional new varieties, and efficient utilization of P. humilis fruit."
https://openalex.org/W3162508403,"In comets, iron and nickel are found in refractory dust particles or in metallic and sulfide grains1. So far, no iron- or nickel-bearing molecules have been observed in the gaseous coma of comets2. Iron and a few other heavy atoms, such as copper and cobalt, have been observed only in two exceptional objects: the Great Comet of 18823 and, almost a century later, C/1965 S1 (Ikeya-Seki)4-9. These sungrazing comets approached the Sun so closely that refractory materials sublimated, and their relative abundance of nickel to iron was similar to that of the Sun and meteorites7. More recently, the presence of iron vapour was inferred from the properties of a faint tail in comet C/2006 P1 (McNaught) at perihelion10, but neither iron nor nickel was reported in the gaseous coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the in situ Rosetta mission11. Here we report that neutral Fe I and Ni I emission lines are ubiquitous in cometary atmospheres, even far from the Sun, as revealed by high-resolution ultraviolet-optical spectra of a large sample of comets of various compositions and dynamical origins. The abundances of both species appear to be of the same order of magnitude, contrasting the typical Solar System abundance ratio."
https://openalex.org/W3160717263,"This study describes the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy associated with the Catalan systematic childhood vaccination calendar and some related psychosocial determinants among paediatric primary care nurses in Barcelona (Spain).Cross-sectional descriptive study. In 2017 we invited the paediatric nurses (N = 165) working in Barcelona public primary health centres with paediatric departments (N = 41) to participate. They answered a questionnaire with sociodemographic and behavioural variables: severity and perceived probability of contracting the diseases of the vaccines in the vaccination schedule; safety and protection offered by each vaccine; and beliefs, social norms, and knowledge about vaccines. Outcome variable was vaccine hesitancy, dichotomized into not hesitant (nurses who would vaccinate their own offspring), and hesitant (including those who would not vaccinate them, those who had doubts and those who would delay the administration of one or more vaccines). We performed bivariate analysis and adjusted logistic regression models.83% of paediatric nurses (N = 137) agreed to participate. 67.9% had the intention to vaccinate their children of all the vaccines in the systematic schedule. 32.1% of nurses experienced vaccine hesitancy, especially about the HPV (21.9%) and varicella (17.5%) vaccines. The multivariate analysis suggests associations between hesitancy and low perception of the severity of whooping cough (aOR: 3.88; 95%CI:1.32-11.4), low perception of safety of the HPV vaccine (aOR:8.5;95%CI:1.24-57.8), the belief that vaccines are administered too early (aOR:6.09;95%CI:1.98-18.8), and not having children (aOR:4.05;95%CI:1.22-13.3).Although most paediatric nurses had the intention to vaccinate their own children, almost one-third reported some kind of vaccine hesitancy, mainly related to doubts about HPV and varicella vaccines, as well as some misconceptions. These factors should be addressed to enhance nurses' fundamental role in promoting vaccination to families."
https://openalex.org/W3161204593,"The endangered snow leopard Panthera uncia occurs in human use landscapes in the mountains of South and Central Asia. Conservationists generally agree that snow leopards must be conserved through a land-sharing approach, rather than land-sparing in the form of strictly protected areas. Effective conservation through land-sharing requires a good understanding of how snow leopards respond to human use of the landscape. Snow leopard density is expected to show spatial variation within a landscape because of variation in the intensity of human use and the quality of habitat. However, snow leopards have been difficult to enumerate and monitor. Variation in the density of snow leopards remains undocumented, and the impact of human use on their populations is poorly understood. We examined spatial variation in snow leopard density in Spiti Valley, an important snow leopard landscape in India, via spatially explicit capture-recapture analysis of camera trap data. We camera trapped an area encompassing a minimum convex polygon of 953 km2. Our best model estimated an overall density of 0.5 (95% CI: 0.31-0.82) mature snow leopards per 100 km2. Using AIC, our best model showed the density of snow leopards to depend on estimated wild prey density, movement about activity centres to depend on altitude, and the expected number of encounters at the activity centre to depend on topography. Models that also used livestock biomass as a density covariate ranked second, but the effect of livestock was weak. Our results highlight the importance of maintaining high density pockets of wild prey populations in multiple-use landscapes to enhance snow leopard conservation."
https://openalex.org/W3163617753,"On 31 August 2019, an interstellar comet was discovered as it passed through the Solar System (2I/Borisov). On the basis of initial imaging observations, 2I/Borisov seemed to be similar to ordinary Solar System comets1,2-an unexpected characteristic given the multiple peculiarities of the only known previous interstellar visitor, 1I/'Oumuamua3-6. Spectroscopic investigations of 2I/Borisov identified the familiar cometary emissions from CN (refs. 7-9), C2 (ref. 10), O I (ref. 11), NH2 (ref. 12), OH (ref. 13), HCN (ref. 14) and CO (refs. 14,15), revealing a composition similar to that of carbon monoxide-rich Solar System comets. At temperatures greater than 700 kelvin, comets also show metallic vapours that are produced by the sublimation of metal-rich dust grains16. Observation of gaseous metals had until very recently17 been limited to bright sunskirting and sungrazing comets18-20 and giant star-plunging exocomets21. Here we report spectroscopic observations of atomic nickel vapour in the cold coma of 2I/Borisov at a heliocentric distance of 2.322 astronomical units-equivalent to an equilibrium temperature of 180 kelvin. Nickel in 2I/Borisov seems to originate from a short-lived nickel-containing molecule with a lifetime of [Formula: see text] seconds at 1 astronomical unit and is produced at a rate of 0.9 ± 0.3 × 1022 atoms per second, or 0.002 per cent relative to OH and 0.3 per cent relative to CN. The detection of gas-phase nickel in the coma of 2I/Borisov is in line with the recent identification of this atom-as well as iron-in the cold comae of Solar System comets17."
https://openalex.org/W3160619491,"In the mammalian testis, two distinct populations of Sertoli cells (SCs), the immature SCs (ISCs) and adult SCs (ASCs), play significant roles in regulating the development and function of Leydig cells. However, the effect of different SC types on the function of Leydig cells is poorly understood. Here, our study showed that miR-145-5p expression was significantly different in SCs at different stages, with the highest expression observed in ISCs. Exosomes mediate the transfer of miR-145-5p from ISCs to Leydig cells. Overexpression of miR-145-5p in Leydig cells significantly downregulated steroidogenic gene expression and inhibited testosterone synthesis. Additionally, miR-145-5p functioned by directly targeted steroidogenic factor-1 (Sf-1) and downregulated the expression of SF-1, which further downregulated the expression of steroidogenic genes, induced accumulation of lipid droplets, and eventually suppressed testosterone production. These findings demonstrate that SC-derived miR-145-5p plays a significant role in regulating the functions of Leydig cells and may therefore serve as a diagnostic biomarker for male hypogonadism developmental abnormalities during puberty."
https://openalex.org/W3161456113,"We described public views toward harm reduction among Canadian adults and tested a social exposure model predicting support for these contentious services, drawing on theories in the morality policy, intergroup relations, addiction, and media communication literatures. A quota sample of 4645 adults (18+ years), randomly drawn from an online research panel and stratified to match age and sex distributions of adults within and across Canadian provinces, was recruited in June 2018. Participants completed survey items assessing support for harm reduction for people who use drugs (PWUD) and for seven harm reduction interventions. Additional items assessed exposure to media coverage on harm reduction, and scales assessing stigma toward PWUD (α = .72), personal familiarity with PWUD (α = .84), and disease model beliefs about addiction (α = .79). Most (64%) Canadians supported harm reduction (provincial estimates = 60% - 73%). Five of seven interventions received majority support, including: outreach (79%), naloxone (72%), drug checking (70%), needle distribution (60%) and supervised drug consumption (55%). Low-threshold opioid agonist treatment and safe inhalation interventions received less support (49% and 44%). Our social exposure model, adjusted for respondent sex, household income, political views, and education, exhibited good fit and accounted for 17% of variance in public support for harm reduction. Personal familiarity with PWUD and disease model beliefs about addiction were directly associated with support (βs = .07 and -0.10, respectively), and indirectly influenced public support via stigmatized attitudes toward PWUD (βs = 0.01 and -0.01, respectively). Strategies to increase support for harm reduction could problematize certain disease model beliefs (e.g., ""There are only two possibilities for an alcoholic or drug addict-permanent abstinence or death"") and creating opportunities to reduce social distance between PWUD, the public, and policy makers."
https://openalex.org/W3161463446,"Social networks, i.e., our in-person and online social relations, are key to lifestyle behavior and health, via mechanisms of influence and support from our relations. We assessed associations between various social network aspects and practicing behavior to prevent respiratory infectious diseases.We analyzed baseline-data (2019) from the SaNAE-cohort on social networks and health, collected by an online questionnaire in Dutch community-dwelling people aged 40-99 years. Outcome was the number of preventive behaviors in past two months [range 0-4]. Associations between network aspects were tested using ordinal regression analyses, adjusting for confounders.Of 5,128 participants (mean age 63; 54% male), 94% regularly washed hands with water and soap, 55% used only paper (not cloth) handkerchiefs/tissues; 19% touched their face as little as possible; 39% kept distance from people with respiratory infectious disease symptoms; median score of behaviors was 2. Mean network size was 11 (46% family; 27% friends); six network members were contacted exclusively in-person and two exclusively via phone/internet. Participants received informational, emotional, and practical support from four, six, and two network members, respectively. Independently associated with more preventive behaviors were: 'strong relationships', i.e., large share of friends and aspects related to so called 'weak relationships', a larger share of distant living network members, higher number of members with whom there was exclusively phone/internet contact, and more network members providing informational support. Club membership and a larger share of same-aged network members were inversely associated.Friends ('strong' relationships) may play an important role in the adoption of infection-preventive behaviors. So may 'weak relationships', e.g. geographically more distant network members, who may provide informational support as via non-physical modes of contact. Further steps are to explore employment of these types of relationships when designing infectious diseases control programs aiming to promote infection-preventive behavior in middle aged-and older individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3162449241,"The COVID-19 disease has infected and killed countless people all over the world since its emergence at the end of 2019. No specific therapy for COVID-19 is not currently available, and urgent treatment solutions are needed. Recent studies have found several potential molecular targets, and one of the most critical proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus work machine is the Papain-like protease (Plpro). Potential inhibitors are available, and their X-ray crystallographic structures in complex with this enzyme have been determined recently. However, their activities against this enzyme are insufficient and need to be characterized and improved to be of clinical values. Therefore, in this work, by utilizing the Supervised Molecular Dynamics (SuMD) simulation method, we achieved multiple unbinding events of Plpro inhibitors, GRL0617, and its derivates, and captured and understood the details of the unbinding pathway. We found that residues of the BL2 loop, such as Tyr268 and Gln269, play major roles in the unbinding pathways, but the most important contributing factor is the natural movements and behavior of the BL2 loop, which can control the entire process. We believe that the details found in this study can be used to refine and optimize potential inhibitors like GRL0617 and design more efficacious inhibitors as a treatment for the SARS-CoV-2 virus."
https://openalex.org/W3163291712,"Background As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic accelerates, the supply of personal protective equipment remains under strain. To combat shortages, re-use of surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirators has been recommended. Prior decontamination is paramount to the re-use of these typically single-use only items and, without compromising their integrity, must guarantee inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other contaminating pathogens. Aim We provide information on the effect of time-dependent passive decontamination (infectivity loss over time during room temperature storage in a breathable bag) and evaluate inactivation of a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate and a non-enveloped model virus as well as mask and respirator integrity following active multiple-cycle vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VHP), ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), and dry heat (DH) decontamination. Methods Masks and respirators, inoculated with infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus or murine norovirus, were submitted to passive decontamination or single or multiple active decontamination cycles; viruses were recovered from sample materials and viral titres were measured via TCID 50 assay. In parallel, filtration efficiency tests and breathability tests were performed according to EN standard 14683 and NIOSH regulations. Results and discussion Infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus and murine norovirus remained detectable on masks and respirators up to five and seven days of passive decontamination. Single and multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH were shown to not adversely affect bacterial filtration efficiency of masks. Single- and multiple UVGI did not adversely affect respirator filtration efficiency, while VHP and DH induced a decrease in filtration efficiency after one or three decontamination cycles. Multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH slightly decreased airflow resistance of masks but did not adversely affect respirator breathability. VHP and UVGI efficiently inactivated both viruses after five, DH after three, decontamination cycles, permitting demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude. This multi-disciplinal approach provides important information on how often a given PPE item may be safely reused."
https://openalex.org/W3162507472,"In this work we propose the use of Entropy to measure variability in pronunciations in pseudowords reading aloud: pseudowords where participants give many different pronunciations receive higher Entropy values. Monolingual adults, monolingual children, and bilingual children proficient in different European languages varying in orthographic depth were tested. We predicted that Entropy values will increase with increasing orthographic depth. Moreover, higher Entropy was expected for younger than older children, as reading experience improves the knowledge of grapheme-phoneme correspondences (GPCs). We also tested if interference from a second language would lead to higher Entropy. Results show that orthographic depth affects Entropy, but only when the items are not strictly matched across languages. We also found that Entropy decreases across age, suggesting that GPC knowledge becomes refined throughout grades 2-4. We found no differences between bilingual and monolingual children. Our results indicate that item characteristics play a fundamental role in pseudoword pronunciation variability, that reading experience is associated with reduced variability in responses, and that in bilinguals' knowledge of a second orthography does not seem to interfere with pseudoword reading aloud."
https://openalex.org/W3159999145,"The main aim was to examine the load bearing of individual hamstring muscles in different contraction types and intensities, through local stiffness measurement by shear wave elastography (SWE). A secondary aim was to examine the relationship between the SWE stiffness measure and hamstrings morphology. Ten healthy males (age 22.1±4.1 years; height 173.7±5.9 cm; body mass 68.6±12.4 kg; mean ± SD) performed knee flexions on an isokinetic dynamometer at different intensities (20-70%MVC, random order) in three separate, randomized conditions: isometric (ISO), concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC). SWE was used to measure muscle shear wave velocity (SWV) in biceps femoris long head (BFlh), semitendinosus (ST) and semimembranosus (SM) during contraction. Muscle anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSA) was measured with magnetic resonance imaging and muscle architecture with B-mode ultrasonography. Muscle SWV increased linearly with contraction intensity, but at a varying rate among muscles and contraction types. ST exhibited greater SWV than BFlh and SM in all contraction types, however, there was an upward shift in the SM SWV-torque relationship in ECC compared to ISO and CON. Strong negative correlations were found between peak ISO SWV and ST ACSA (r = -0.81, p = 0.005) and BFlh pennation angle (r = -0.75, p = 0.012). These results suggest that ST has a primary role in hamstrings load bearing in all contraction types, likely due to its morphology; however, there is evidence of increased contribution from SM in eccentric muscle actions."
https://openalex.org/W3161450396,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complicated neurodegenerative disease and therefore addressing multiple targets simultaneously has been believed as a promising therapeutic strategy against AD. α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which plays an important role in improving cognitive function and alleviating neuroinflammation in central nervous system (CNS), has been regarded as a potential target in the treatment of AD. However, the regulation of α7 nAChR at post-transcriptional level in mammalian brain remains largely speculated. Herein, we uncovered a novel post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of α7 nAChR expression in AD and further demonstrated that miR-98-5p suppressed α7 nAChR expression through directly binding to the 3′UTR of mRNA. Knockdown of miR-98-5p activated Ca2+ signaling pathway and consequently reversed cognitive deficits and Aβ burden in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, miR-98-5p downregulation increased α7 nAChR expression, and ameliorated neuroinflammation via inhibiting NF-κB pathway and upregulating Nrf2 target genes. Our findings illustrate a prominent regulatory role of miR-98-5p in targeting inflammation and cognition, and provide an insight into the potential of miR-98-5p/α7 nAChR axis as a novel therapeutic strategy for AD."
https://openalex.org/W3160539481,"Worries associated with COVID-19 health consequences are well-justified. They may motivate people to take safety precautions, but may hinder if they become too intense. Current research has examined mainly age and gender as potential correlates associated with worries. This study instead, is focused on self-perceptions of aging (SPA) and perceived age discrimination as potential predictors of worry, in the light of the ageism pandemic which has co-occurred with the COVID-19 outbreak. The study is based on a national sample of 1,092 adults aged 50 and above in Israel. Phone interviews were conducted between March 29 2020 and May 3 2020, when Israel gradually moved from strict to partial lockdown. Respondents were queried about their worries related to COVID-19 health consequences, demographic characteristics, known-risk factors, SPA and perceived age-based discrimination in the healthcare system. Our findings show that in addition, to sex, financial status and chronic illness, SPA and age-based discrimination in the healthcare were significant predictors of worries and explained additional 8% of the variance. The findings point to the potentially negative impact of the ageism pandemic in an area that has not received much attention, thus far, namely people’s worries. Interventions that address ageism directed by self or others might alleviate worries in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3161347888,"Grain-free pet food options abound in the pet food market today, representing more than 40% of available dry dog foods in the United States. There is currently a dearth of information about the factors that contribute to a dog owner's choice of a grain-free dry dog food and if those factors are similar among countries. Therefore, the primary objective of the current survey was to identify the variables that are predictive of a dog owner's choice of a grain-free dry food across North America (Canada and the United States) and Europe (France, the United Kingdom and Germany). The survey consisted of 69 questions, took less than 15 minutes to complete and was distributed virtually via Qualtrics (Qualtrics XM, Utah, USA). A total of 3,298 responses were collected, equally distributed between countries. Multinomial logistic regression was performed in SPSS Statistics (Version 26, IBM Corp, North Castle, New York, USA). Male respondents, people from France, people who ranked the importance of ingredients in a pet food in the lower quartiles and people who do not rotate their dog's diet to provide variety were less likely to select 'no grain' when choosing a pet food. In contrast, people who believe that their dog has a food allergy, follow more than 5 specific dietary routines in their own diet, do not try to include grains in their own diet, get their information about pet food from online resources or pet store staff and look for specific claims on pet food (such as 'no fillers'), were all more likely to select 'no grain' when choosing a pet food. This survey provides insight into the similarities and differences in decision making among dog owners in North America and Europe and should be considered when exploring the effects of grain-free dog foods on canine health and well-being."
https://openalex.org/W3161697314,"Sphingolipids (SL) are ubiquitous in mammalian cell membranes, yet there is little data on the behavior of cells under SL-restriction conditions. LY-B cells derive from a CHO linein whichserine palmitoyl transferase (SPT), thus de novo SL synthesis, is suppressed, while maintaining the capacity of taking up and metabolizing exogenous sphingoid bases from the culture medium. In this study, LY-B cells were adapted to grow in a fetal bovine serum (FBS)-deficient medium to avoid external uptake of lipids. The lowest FBS concentration that allowed LY-B cell growth, though at a slow rate, under our conditions was 0.04%, that is, 250-fold less than the standard (10%) concentration. Cells grown under limiting SL concentrations remained viable for at least 72 hours. Enriching with sphingomyelin the SL-deficient medium allowed the recovery of growth rates analogous to those of control LY-B cells. Studies including whole cells, plasma membrane preparations, and derived lipid vesicles were carried out. Laurdan fluorescence was recorded to measure membrane molecular order, showing a significant decrease in the rigidity of LY-B cells, not only in plasma membrane but also in whole cell lipid extract, as a result of SL limitation in the growth medium. Plasma membrane preparations and whole cell lipid extracts were also studied using atomic force microscopy in the force spectroscopy mode. Force measurements demonstrated that lower breakthrough forces were required to penetrate samples obtained from SL-poor LY-B cells than those obtained from control cells. Mass-spectroscopic analysis was also a helpful tool to understand the rearrangement undergone by the LY-B cell lipid metabolism. The most abundant SL in LY-B cells, sphingomyelin, decreased by about 85% as a result of SL limitation in the medium, the bioactive lipid ceramide and the ganglioside precursor hexosylceramide decreased similarly, together with cholesterol. Quantitative SL analysis showed that a 250-fold reduction in sphingolipid supply to LY-B cells led only to a sixfold decrease in membrane sphingolipids, underlining the resistance to changes in composition of these cells. Plasma membrane compositions exhibited similar changes, at least qualitatively, as the whole cells with SL restriction. A linear correlation was observed between the sphingomyelin concentration in the membranes, the degree of lipid order as measured by laurdan fluorescence, and membrane breakthrough forces assessed by atomic force microscopy. Smaller, though significant, changes were also detected in glycerophospholipids under SL-restriction conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3162836810,"During the insertion of dental implants in the bone tissue, different torque values can be applied. However, the high applied torque can cause damage to the implant connection. Our study sought to evaluate, by measuring the angle of rotation of the insertion drive and, later microscopic observation, possible changes in the structure of implants of different diameters with 3 different types of connections after the application of 4 different torque intensities.Three hundred tapered dental implants and three hundred insertion drivers were used in the present study. Implants of 3.5 and 4 mm in diameter with 3 connection models were tested: external hexagon (EH), internal hexagon (IH) and Morse taper (MT). Then, sis groups were performed: EH3 group, EH4 group, IH3 group, IH4 group, MT3 group and MT4 group. The samples were submitted to the torque/torsion force at 4 intensities (n = 10 samples per group and intensity): 60, 80, 100 and 120 Ncm. The turning angle of the insertion driver was measured in each test. In addition, in 10 samples from each group, the maximum torque value supported by each implant model was measured. After the tests, all samples were inspected microscopically to describe the observed changes.The maximum torque supported by the different implant models showed statistically significant difference (p < 0.0001). The values of the measured angles showed statistically significant differences between the torque values applied within each group (p < 0.001) and between groups with the same torque value (p < 0.001).Within the limitations of the present study in vitro, the results showed that high torque values cause mechanical damage to the implants."
https://openalex.org/W3160977250,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a major cause of maternal and new-born morbidity and mortality. Angiogenic factors contribute a major role in the vascular dysfunction associated with PE. We investigated the circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor (PlGF) and soluble Feline McDonough Sarcoma (fms)-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt1), their association with PE and diagnostic performance of disease among pregnant women in Uganda. Using a case-control study design, 106 women with PE and 106 with normal pregnancy were enrolled. Demographic and clinical characteristics, and anticoagulated blood samples were collected from participants. Plasma VEGF, PlGF and sFlt1 levels were measured using Luminex and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Conditional logistic regression was used to explore association of angiogenic factors with PE and receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to investigate PE diagnostic performance. Levels of VEGF and PIGF were significantly lower in cases compared to controls (VEGF: median = 0.71 pg/ml (IQR = 0.38-1.11) Vs 1.20 pg/ml (0.64-1.91), p-value<0.001 and PlGF: 2.20 pg/ml (1.08-5.86) Vs 84.62 pg/ml (34.00-154.45), p-value<0.001). Plasma levels of sFlt1 were significantly higher in cases than controls (median = 141.13 (71.76-227.10) x103 pg/ml Vs 19.86 (14.20-29.37) x103 pg/ml). Increasing sFlt1 levels were associated with increased likelihood of PE (aOR = 4.73; 95% CI, 1.18-19.01; p-value = 0.0287). The sFlt1/PlGF ratio and sFlt1 had a better performance for diagnosis of PE, with AUC = 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93-0.98) followed by PlGF with AUC = 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91-0.97). Therefore, sFlt1, sFlt1/PlGF ratio and PlGF are potential candidates for incorporation into algorithms for PE diagnosis in the Ugandan population."
https://openalex.org/W3162697935,"The role of heterochromatin in cell fate specification during development is unclear. We demonstrate that loss of the lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9) methyltransferase G9a in the mammary epithelium results in de novo chromatin opening, aberrant formation of the mammary ductal tree, impaired stem cell potential, disrupted intraductal polarity, and loss of tissue function. G9a loss derepresses long terminal repeat (LTR) retroviral sequences (predominantly the ERVK family). Transcriptionally activated endogenous retroviruses generate double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) that triggers an antiviral innate immune response, and knockdown of the cytosolic dsDNA sensor Aim2 in G9a knockout (G9acKO) mammary epithelium rescues mammary ductal invasion. Mammary stem cell transplantation into immunocompromised or G9acKO-conditioned hosts shows partial dependence of the G9acKO mammary morphological defects on the inflammatory milieu of the host mammary fat pad. Thus, altering the chromatin accessibility of retroviral elements disrupts mammary gland development and stem cell activity through both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3163825278,"Autorefractors allow non-specialists to quickly assess refractive error, and thus could be a useful component of large-scale vision screening programs. In order to better characterize the role of autorefraction for public health outreach programs in resource-limited settings, the diagnostic accuracy of two autorefractors was assessed relative to subjective refraction in an adult Indian population.An optometrist refracted a series of patients aged ≥50 years at an eye clinic in Bangalore, India using the Nidek ARK-900 autorefractor first, followed by the 3nethra Royal autorefractor, and then subjective refraction. The diagnostic accuracy of each autorefractor for myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism was assessed using subjective refraction as the reference standard, and measures of agreement between refractions were calculated.A total of 197 eyes in 104 individuals (mean age 63 ± 8 years, 52% female) were evaluated. Both autorefractors produced spherical equivalent estimates that were on average more hyperopic than subjective refraction, with a measurement bias of +0.16 D (95%CI +0.09 to +0.23D) for Nidek and +0.42 D (95%CI +0.28 to +0.54D) for 3nethra. When comparing pairs of measurements from autorefraction and subjective refraction, the limits of agreement were approximately ±1D for the Nidek autorefractor and ±1.75D for the 3Nethra autorefractor. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting ≥1 diopter of myopia were 94.6% (95%CI 86.8-100%) and 92.5% (95%CI 88.9-97.5%) for the Nidek, and 89.2% (95%CI 66.7-97.4) and 77.5% (95%CI 71.2-99.4%) for the 3Nethra. The accuracy of each autorefractor increased at greater levels of refractive error.The sensitivity and specificity of the Nidek autorefractor for diagnosing refractive error among adults ≥50 years in an urban Indian clinic was sufficient for screening for visually significant refractive errors, although the relatively wide limits of agreement suggest that subjective refinement of the eyeglasses prescription would still be necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3160950859,"Brazil is the largest consumer of dry edible beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in the world, 70% of consumption is of the carioca variety. Although the variety has high yield, it is susceptible to several diseases, among them, anthracnose (ANT) can lead to losses of up to 100% of production. The most effective strategy to overcome ANT, a disease caused by the fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum , is the development of resistant cultivars. For that reason, the selection of carioca genotypes resistant to multiple ANT races and the identification of loci /markers associated with genetic resistance are extremely important for the genetic breeding process. Using a carioca diversity panel (CDP) with 125 genotypes and genotyped by BeadChip BARCBean6K_3 and a carioca segregating population AM (AND-277 × IAC-Milênio) genotyped by sequencing (GBS). Multiple interval mapping (MIM) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used as mapping tools for the resistance genes to the major ANT physiological races present in the country. In general, 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed high significance for resistance by GWAS, and loci associated with multiple races were also identified, as the Co-3 locus . The SNPs ss715642306 and ss715649427 in linkage disequilibrium (LD) at the beginning of chromosome Pv04 were associated with all the races used, and 16 genes known to be related to plant immunity were identified in this region. Using the resistant cultivars and the markers associated with significant quantitative resistance loci (QRL), discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) was performed considering the allelic contribution to resistance. Through the DAPC clustering, cultivar sources with high potential for durable anthracnose resistance were recommended. The MIM confirmed the presence of the Co-1 4 locus in the AND-277 cultivar which revealed that it was the only one associated with resistance to ANT race 81. Three other loci were associated with race 81 on chromosomes Pv03, Pv10, and Pv11. This is the first study to identify new resistance loci in the AND-277 cultivar. Finally, the same Co-1 4 locus was also significant for the CDP at the end of Pv01. The new SNPs identified, especially those associated with more than one race, present great potential for use in marker-assisted and early selection of inbred lines."
https://openalex.org/W3160980095,"The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects is an important form of transmissibility. Thus, in this study, we evaluated the performance of a disinfection chamber designed for instantaneous dispersion of the biocidal agent solution, in order to characterize a new device that can be used to protect individuals by reducing the transmissibility of the disease through contaminated surfaces. We proposed the necessary adjustments in the configuration to improve the dispersion on surfaces and the effectiveness of the developed equipment. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of the present technology with a chamber having six nebulizer nozzles were performed and validated through qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and experimental tests were conducted using the method Water-Sensitive Paper (WSP), with an exposure to the biocidal agent for 10 and 30 s. After evaluation, a new passage procedure for the chamber with six nozzles and a new configuration of the disinfection chamber were proposed. In the chamber with six nozzles, a deficiency was identified in its central region, where the suspended droplet concentration was close to zero. However, with the new passage procedure, there was a significant increase in wettability of the surface. With the proposition of the chamber with 12 nozzles, the suspended droplet concentration in different regions increased, with an average increase of 266%. The experimental results of the new configuration proved that there was an increase in wettability at all times of exposure, and it was more significant for an exposure of 30 s. Additionally, even in different passage procedures, there were no significant differences in the results for an exposure of 10 s, thereby showing the effectiveness of the new configuration or improved spraying and wettability by the biocidal agent, as well as in minimizing the impact caused by human factor in the performance of the disinfection technology."
https://openalex.org/W3162058780,"Numerous long-term, free-air plant growth facilities currently explore vegetation responses to the ongoing climate change in northern latitudes. Open top chamber (OTC) experiments as well as the experimental set-ups with active warming focus on many facets of plant growth and performance, but information on morphological alterations of plant cells is still scarce. Here we compare the effects of in-situ warming on leaf epidermal cell expansion in dwarf birch, Betula nana in Finland, Greenland, and Poland. The localities of the three in-situ warming experiments represent contrasting regions of B. nana distribution, with the sites in Finland and Greenland representing the current main distribution in low and high Arctic, respectively, and the continental site in Poland as a B. nana relict Holocene microrefugium. We quantified the epidermal cell lateral expansion by microscopic analysis of B. nana leaf cuticles. The leaves were produced in paired experimental treatment plots with either artificial warming or ambient temperature. At all localities, the leaves were collected in two years at the end of the growing season to facilitate between-site and within-site comparison. The measured parameters included the epidermal cell area and circumference, and using these, the degree of cell wall undulation was calculated as an Undulation Index (UI). We found enhanced leaf epidermal cell expansion under experimental warming, except for the extremely low temperature Greenland site where no significant difference occurred between the treatments. These results demonstrate a strong response of leaf growth at individual cell level to growing season temperature, but also suggest that in harsh conditions other environmental factors may limit this response. Our results provide evidence of the relevance of climate warming for plant leaf maturation and underpin the importance of studies covering large geographical scales."
https://openalex.org/W3161342273,"Although some prognostic factors for COVID-19 were consistently identified across the studies, differences were found for other factors that could be due to the characteristics of the study populations and the variables incorporated into the statistical model. We aimed to a priori identify specific patient profiles and then assess their association with the outcomes in COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms admitted specifically to hospital wards.We conducted a retrospective single-center study from February 2020 to April 2020. A non-supervised cluster analysis was first used to detect patient profiles based on characteristics at admission of 220 consecutive patients admitted to our institution. Then, we assessed the prognostic value using Cox regression analyses to predict survival.Three clusters were identified, with 47 patients in cluster 1, 87 in cluster 2, and 86 in cluster 3; the presentation of the patients differed among the clusters. Cluster 1 mostly included sexagenarian patients with active malignancies who were admitted early after the onset of COVID-19. Cluster 2 included the oldest patients, who were generally overweight and had hypertension and renal insufficiency, while cluster 3 included the youngest patients, who had gastrointestinal symptoms and delayed admission. Sixty-day survival rates were 74.3%, 50.6% and 96.5% in clusters 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This was confirmed by the multivariable Cox analyses that showed the prognostic value of these patterns.The cluster approach seems appropriate and pragmatic for the early identification of patient profiles that could help physicians segregate patients according to their prognosis."

The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between nutritional status and cognition of school-aged children in the Kumasi metropolis, Ghana. Methods 389 children were selected from ten government-owned schools. Socio-demographic and anthropometric data were collected. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for nutrients levels. Dietary intakes were assessed using food frequency questionnaire and previous day’s nutrients intake. Cognition test was performed using the Ravens Colored Progressive Matrix (RCPM). Results Mean age of participants was 8.9±1.4 years, mean RCPM score was 17.9±5.4. More girls scored RCPM below the 40 th percentile (45.5%) than boys (33.7%), while mother’s level of education significantly associated with RCPM percentiles of the children (p = 0.037). Four dietary patterns were generated from food frequency data, and scores of the second pattern, depicting vegetables, non-fruits, bread and cereals, showed a weak negative correlation (r = -0.132, p = 0.026) with previous day’s dietary zinc intake. Cognitive status did not vary by anthropometric and dietary patterns. More anemic (54.4%) than non-anemic (33.3%) children were below the 40 th RCPM percentile. Mean previous day’s intake for folate (p&lt;0.001), vitamin B 6 (p = 0.018), iron (p&lt;0.001), and zinc (p = 0.001) differed significantly between the cognitive test score percentiles of the children. Spearman rank correlation showed weak positive associations between RCPM score and hemoglobin (r = 0.246, p = 0.003) and serum ferritin (r = 0.176, p = 0.036). Binary regression analysis showed anemic children (aOR = 0.4; 95%CI = 0.2–0.8, p = 0.014), compared with non-anemic had decreased odds, while boys, compared with girls had increased odds (aOR = 2.0 95%CI = 1.0–4.0, p = 0.035) for scoring above the 50 th RCPM percentile. Conclusions Iron status, especially hemoglobin levels, correlated with the cognitive performance of school-aged children in the metropolis. Thus nutritional strategies aimed at reducing iron deficiency anemia are needed."

However, the effectiveness of the routine evaluation of coronary arteries such as routine coronary angiography (CAG) in PAD patients receiving percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is unclear.A total of 765 consecutive PAD patients underwent successful PTA and 674 patients (88.1%) underwent routine CAG. Coronary artery disease (CAD) was defined as angiographic stenosis ≥70%. Patients were divided into three groups; 1) routine CAG and a presence of CAD (n = 413 patients), 2) routine CAG and no CAD group (n = 261 patients), and 3) no CAG group (n = 91 patients). To adjust for any potential confounders that could cause bias, multivariable Cox-proportional hazards regression and propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier curved analysis at 5-year follow-up.In this study, the 5-year survival rate of patients with PAD who underwent PTA was 88.5%. Survival rates were similar among the CAD group, the no CAD group, and the no CAG group, respectively (87.7% vs. 90.4% vs. 86.8% P = 0.241). After PSM analysis between the CAD group and the no CAD group, during the 5-year clinical follow-up, there were no differences in the incidence of death, myocardial infarction, strokes, peripheral revascularization, or target extremity surgeries between the two groups except for repeat PCI, which was higher in the CAD group than the non-CAD group (9.3% vs. 0.8%, P<0.001).PAD patients with CAD were expected to have very poor long-term survival, but they are shown no different long-term prognosis such as mortality compared to PAD patients without CAD. These PAD patients with CAD had received PCI and/or optimal medication treatment after the CAG. Therefore a strategy of routine CAG and subsequent PCI, if required, appears to be a reasonable strategy for mortality risk reduction of PAD patients. Our results highlight the importance for evaluation for CAD in patients with PAD."

In this study, a three-dimensional heat transfer model of the three types of HGHEs for ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) was established. Based on the simulation results, the long-term heat transfer performances were investigated, including the temperature field of surrounding energy-storage soils, outlet working fluid temperature, coefficient of performance (COP) of units, and surplus temperature of the energy-storage soils. A new concept named heat transfer capacity per heat-affected area was proposed in this paper. It is found that the spiral-coil HGHEs have the best performances in terms of working-fluid outlet temperature, unit COP, total heat transfer capacity, heat transfer rate heat-affected area. The linear HGHEs shows the best performances in terms of mitigating heat imbalance risk and heat transfer rate per length.

https://openalex.org/W3163880635,"The federally threatened American crocodile ( Crocodylus acutus ) is a flagship species and ecological indicator of hydrologic restoration in the Florida Everglades. We conducted a long-term capture-recapture study on the South Florida population of American crocodiles from 1978 to 2015 to evaluate the effects of restoration efforts to more historic hydrologic conditions. The study produced 10,040 crocodile capture events of 9,865 individuals and more than 90% of captures were of hatchlings. Body condition and growth rates of crocodiles were highly age-structured with younger crocodiles presenting with the poorest body condition and highest growth rates. Mean crocodile body condition in this study was 2.14±0.35 SD across the South Florida population. Crocodiles exposed to hypersaline conditions (&gt; 40 psu) during the dry season maintained lower body condition scores and reduced growth rate by 13% after one year, by 24% after five years, and by 29% after ten years. Estimated hatchling survival for the South Florida population was 25% increasing with ontogeny and reaching near 90% survival at year six. Hatchling survival was 34% in NE Florida Bay relative to a 69% hatchling survival at Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge and 53% in Flamingo area of Everglades National Park. Hypersaline conditions negatively affected survival, growth and body condition and was most pronounced in NE Florida Bay, where the hydrologic conditions have been most disturbed. The American crocodile, a long-lived animal, with relatively slow growth rate provides an excellent model system to measure the effects of altered hydropatterns in the Everglades landscape. These results illustrate the need for continued long-term monitoring to assess system-wide restoration outcomes and inform resource managers."
https://openalex.org/W3160881470,"Objectives Saline and Plasma-Lyte have different physiochemical contents; consequently, they may differently affect patients’ renal function. We compared the effects of fluid therapy with 0.9% saline and with Plasma-Lyte 148 on renal function as assessed by creatinine concentration among patients undergoing major surgery. Methods We conducted a prospective, double-blinded cluster crossover trial comparing the effects of the two fluids on major surgery patients. The primary aim was to establish the pilot feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy evidence base for a large interventional trial to establish whether saline or Plasma-Lyte is the preferred crystalloid fluid for managing major surgery patients. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with changes in renal function as assessed by creatinine concentration during their index hospital admission. We used changes in creatinine to define acute kidney injury (AKI) according to the RIFLE criteria. Results The study was feasible with 100% patient and clinician acceptance. There were no deviations from the trial protocol. After screening, we allocated 602 patients to saline and 458 to Plasma-Lyte. The median (IQR) volume of intraoperative fluid received was 2000 mL (1000:2000) in both groups. Forty-nine saline patients (8.1%) and 49 Plasma-Lyte patients (10.7%) developed a postoperative AKI (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR]: 1.34; 95% CI: 0.93–1.95; p = 0.120). No differences were observed in the development of postoperative complications (aIRR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.89–1.08) or the severity of the worst complication (aIRR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.78–1.30). The median (IQR) length of hospital stay was six days (3:11) for the saline group and five days (3:10) for the Plasma-Lyte group (aIRR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.73–0.98). There were no serious adverse events relating to the trial fluids, nor were there fluid crossover or contamination events. Conclusions The study design was feasible to support a future follow-up larger clinical trial. Patients treated with saline did not demonstrate an increased incidence of postoperative AKI (defined as changes in creatinine) compared to those treated with Plasma-Lyte. Our findings imply that clinicians can reasonably use either solution intraoperatively for adult patients undergoing major surgery.

The current study examined the gender differences in MV among the matrilineal ethnic minority Garo, patrilineal ethnic minority Santal, and the patrilineal mainstream Bengali communities in rural Bangladesh. Adopting a cross-sectional design, we randomly included 1,929 currently married men and women from 24 villages. We used cross-tabulations as well as multivariate logistic regressions to estimate the ethnic and gender differences in MV. Data revealed that women were widely exposed to different types of MV, while only a few men experienced such abuses. It showed that 95.6% of the women experienced emotional abuse, 63.5% physical abuse, 71.4% sexual abuse, and 50.6% poly-victimization, whereas these rates were quite low among the men (emotional = 9.7%, physical = 0.7%, sexual = 0.1%). No men reported poly-victimization. The odds ratio (OR) for emotional, physical, and sexual MV were respectively, 184.44 (95% CI = 93.65-363.24, p<0.001), 449.23 (95% CI = 181.59-1111.35, p<0.001), and 2789.71(95% CI = 381.36-20407.08, p<0.001) for women compared to men. Data further revealed that matrilineal Garo women experienced less MV (emotional = 90.7%, physical = 53.4%, sexual = 64.0%, poly = 38.8%) than the patrilineal Santal (emotional = 99.4%, physical = 67.3%, sexual = 71.3%, poly = 53.9%) and Bengali women (emotional = 96.6%, physical = 69.6%, sexual = 78.8%, poly = 58.9%). Multivariate regressions also showed that the Bengali society perpetrated more physical (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.27-2.85, p = 0.002) and sexual (OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.34-3.10, p = 0.001) MV than the Garo society. It appears that MV is largely a gendered issue in the country. Though both women and men can be the victims of MV, the nature/extent of victimization noticeably differs according to the social organization. Matrilineal society appears to be less abusive than the patrilineal one. Interventions aimed to prevent domestic violence in rural Bangladesh should take these findings into account."
https://openalex.org/W3161703166,"We study the effects of two mechanisms which increase the efficacy of contact-tracing applications (CTAs) such as the mobile phone contact-tracing applications that have been used during the COVID-19 epidemic. The first mechanism is the introduction of user referrals. We compare four scenarios for the uptake of CTAs—(1) the p % of individuals that use the CTA are chosen randomly, (2) a smaller initial set of randomly-chosen users each refer a contact to use the CTA, achieving p % in total, (3) a small initial set of randomly-chosen users each refer around half of their contacts to use the CTA, achieving p % in total, and (4) for comparison, an idealised scenario in which the p % of the population that uses the CTA is the p % with the most contacts. Using agent-based epidemiological models incorporating a geometric space, we find that, even when the uptake percentage p % is small, CTAs are an effective tool for mitigating the spread of the epidemic in all scenarios. Moreover, user referrals significantly improve efficacy. In addition, it turns out that user referrals reduce the quarantine load. The second mechanism for increasing the efficacy of CTAs is tuning the severity of quarantine measures. Our modelling shows that using CTAs with mild quarantine measures is effective in reducing the maximum hospital load and the number of people who become ill, but leads to a relatively high quarantine load, which may cause economic disruption. Fortunately, under stricter quarantine measures, the advantages are maintained but the quarantine load is reduced. Our models incorporate geometric inhomogeneous random graphs to study the effects of the presence of super-spreaders and of the absence of long-distant contacts (e.g., through travel restrictions) on our conclusions."
https://openalex.org/W3159990157,"Although there is convincing evidence for socio-cognitive impairments in schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD), little evidence is found for deficient moral cognition. We investigated whether patients with SSD showed altered moral judgments in a story task where the protagonist either had a neutral or malicious intention towards another person. This paradigm examined whether SSD relates to altered moral cognition in general or specifically to impaired integration of prior information (such as beliefs) in moral judgments.23 patients and 32 healthy controls read vignettes created in a 2 x 2 design. The protagonist in each story either had a neutral or negative intention towards another person which, as a result, either died (negative outcome) or did not die (neutral outcome). Participants rated the moral permissibility of the protagonist's action. Standard null hypothesis significance testing and equivalent Bayes analyses are reported.Schizophrenia patients did not differ significantly in permissibility ratings from healthy controls. This finding was supported by the Bayes analyses which favoured the null hypothesis. Task performance was not related to symptom severity or medication.The current findings do not support the notion that moral judgments are deficient in schizophrenia. Furthermore, the current study shows that patients do not have observable difficulties in integrating the protagonist's belief in the rating of the moral permissibility of the action-outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3162093461,"Purpose To analyze the association between glucosamine (GlcN) use and the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using claims data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Methods A retrospective, population-based study was conducted with NHIRD data from a 14-year period (2000–2013). Chi-squared and Student’s t-tests were used to evaluate differences between the study and comparison cohorts for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Risk factors for disease development were examined by the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95% confidence interval. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to compare the cumulative risk of AMD between the two cohorts. Results In total, 1,344 patients with GlcN treatment were enrolled in the study cohort and 5,376 patients without GlcN use were enrolled in the comparison cohort. The incidence rate of AMD was lower with GlcN use (3.65%) than without GlcN use (5.26%) (P = 0.014). GlcN use was associated with a lower risk of developing AMD among patients with hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, other neurological disorders, or degenerative arthritis. Although the incidence of wet type AMD did not significantly differ (P = 0.91), the incidence of dry type AMD was lower in patients with GlcN use (2.9%) than those without GlcN use (4.84%) (P = 0.003). Kaplan-Meier analysis similarly revealed a lower rate of dry type AMD in patients with GlcN use compared to those without GlcN use (log-rank P = 0.004). Conclusions GlcN treatment can decrease the risk of developing dry type AMD. Further prospective controlled studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of GlcN treatment in patients with AMD and the associated mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3162782967,"In epidemiologic studies where physician-based case adjudication is not feasible, Parkinson's disease (PD) case ascertainment is often limited to self-reports which may not be accurate. We evaluated strategies to identify PD cases in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS).Doctor-diagnosed PD was self-reported on all cohort-wide surveys; potential cases were also identified from death certificates. Follow-up surveys asked about PD-related motor and non-motor symptoms. For PD confirmation, we collected additional diagnosis, symptom, and treatment data from 510 potential PD cases or their proxy (65% of those contacted) in a supplemental screener and obtained medical records for a subset (n = 65). We classified PD cases using established criteria and screener data.Of 510 potential PD cases, 75% were considered ""probable"" or ""possible""; this proportion increased among participants diagnosed by a specialist (81.2%), taking PD medication (85.2%), or reporting ≥5 motor symptoms (86.8%) in a regular AHS survey. Of those with medical records, 93% (57 of 61) of probable or possible PD was confirmed. Never-smoking and non-motor and motor symptoms reported in prior AHS surveys were more common with probable/possible PD than unconfirmed PD.In this retrospective PD case ascertainment effort, we found that PD self-report with information on motor symptoms or medications may be a reasonable alternative for identifying PD cases when physician exam is not feasible. Because of intervening mortality, screeners could not be obtained from about one-third of those contacted. Thus, findings warrant replication."
https://openalex.org/W3163240391,"Excellent braking performance is the premise of safe driving, and improve the braking performance by upgrading structures and optimizing parameters of braking systems has become the pursuit of engineers. With the development of autonomous driving and intelligent connected vehicle, new structural schemes such as electro-mechanical brakes (EMBs) have become the future of vehicle braking systems. Meanwhile, many scholars have dedicated to the research on the parameters optimization of braking systems. While, most of the studies focus on reducing the brake size and weight, improving the brake responses by optimizing the parameters, almost not involving the braking performance, and the optimization variables are relatively single. On these foundations, a multi-objective optimal design of EMB parameters is proposed to enhance the vehicle's braking performance. Its objectives and constraints were defined based on relevant standards and regulations. Subsequently, the decision variables were set, and optimal math model was established. Furthermore, the co-simulation platform was constructed, and the optimal design and simulation analyses factoring in the crucial structural and control parameters were performed. The results confirmed that the maximum braking pressure response time of the EMB is decreased by approximately 0.3 s, the stopping distance (SD) of 90 km/h-0 is shortened by about 3.44 m. Moreover, the mean fully developed deceleration (MFDD) is increased by 0.002 g, and the lateral displacement of the body (LD) is reduced by about 0.037 m. Hence, the vehicle braking performance is improved."
https://openalex.org/W3161612723,"During a period of 6 months, we provided our entire neuroradiological staff including physicians, radiographers, and researchers with systematic feedback via email on the further clinical course of stroke patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy. We analyzed the effects of this feedback on work satisfaction, work meaningfulness and valuation of the therapy among our staff.Our staff completed two self-reported questionnaires before and after the period of six months with systematic feedback.Employees with higher work meaningfulness and higher work satisfaction valuated endovascular stroke therapy as more useful (p<0.001). A good clinical outcome was regarded more motivating than a good interventional outcome (p<0.001). Receiving systematic feedback did not increase work satisfaction (p = 0.318) or work meaningfulness (p = 0.178). Radiographers valuated the usefulness of interventional therapy the worst of all employees (p≤ 0.017). After the feedback period, 75% of radiographers estimated stroke as a more severe disease than before. Also, their desire for feedback decreased significantly (p = 0.007). Primarily patient cases with unfavorable outcomes were remembered by the staff.Systematic email feedback does not per se enhance work satisfaction or work meaningfulness among employees. However, receiving feedback is educative for the staff. Evaluating work satisfaction and the perception of treatment may help to identify unexpected issues and may therefore help to find specific measures that increase work satisfaction and motivation."
https://openalex.org/W3162769633,"In this paper, we focus on why intraplate seismic initiation and migration occurs, which has widely been considered to be caused by static stress triggering caused by earthquakes, as well as post-seismic slips. To illustrate the mechanism underlying large earthquakes, in particular the migration caused by two key episodes that occurred after 1500 in the Bohai-Zhangjiakou Fault Zone (BZFZ) of North China, we developed a high-resolution three-dimensional viscoelastic finite element model that includes the active faults with vertical segmentation, their periodical locking, and the lithosphere heterogeneity. We used the birth and death of element groups to simulate stress intensity changes during the two episodes (named Episode I and II), with our results showing that the Tangshan earthquake was primarily triggered by the Sanhe-Pinggu M8.0 earthquake in 1679, whereas the Zhangbei M6.2 earthquake in 1998 was not triggered by earthquakes in Episode I. According to our work, the calculated stress changes in the different segments of the fault zone correspond to the magnitude of the triggered earthquakes. Further, the largest stress decrease was near the Sanhe-Pinggu fault and occurred the largest earthquake in Episode I, whereas the largest stress increase was near the Tangshan fault and occurred during the largest earthquake in Episode II. Given the above, we propose a model for seismic migration to describe the dynamic mechanisms of earthquake migration within the BZFZ and North China, in which the factors affecting both the seismic migration path and intensity primarily include the distance between the triggered active fault and the original fault, the coupling of the active faults, the location and scale of the low-velocity anomaly, its distance from the active fault, and the location and scale of the crustal thinning."
