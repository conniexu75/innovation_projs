https://openalex.org/W2151246207,"We report here the adoptive transfer, to patients with metastatic melanoma, of highly selected tumor-reactive T cells directed against overexpressed self-derived differentiation antigens after a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen. This approach resulted in the persistent clonal repopulation of T cells in those cancer patients, with the transferred cells proliferating in vivo, displaying functional activity, and trafficking to tumor sites. This led to regression of the patients' metastatic melanoma as well as to the onset of autoimmune melanocyte destruction. This approach presents new possibilities for the treatment of patients with cancer as well as patients with human immunodeficiency virus-related acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and other infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2030489111,"Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory molecules that mediate effects by interacting with messenger RNA (mRNA) targets. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana miRNA 39 (also known as miR171), a 21-ribonucleotide species that accumulates predominantly in inflorescence tissues, is produced from an intergenic region in chromosome III and functionally interacts with mRNA targets encoding several members of the Scarecrow-like ( SCL ) family of putative transcription factors. miRNA 39 is complementary to an internal region of three SCL mRNAs. The interaction results in specific cleavage of target mRNA within the region of complementarity, indicating that this class of miRNA functions like small interfering RNA associated with RNA silencing to guide sequence-specific cleavage in a developmentally controlled manner."
https://openalex.org/W2099364141,"Reactive oxygen species are required for cell proliferation but can also induce apoptosis1. In proliferating cells this paradox is solved by the activation of protein kinase B (PKB; also known as c-Akt), which protects cells from apoptosis2. By contrast, it is unknown how quiescent cells that lack PKB activity are protected against cell death induced by reactive oxygen species. Here we show that the PKB-regulated Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a (also known as FKHR-L1) protects quiescent cells from oxidative stress by directly increasing their quantities of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) messenger RNA and protein. This increase in protection from reactive oxygen species antagonizes apoptosis caused by glucose deprivation. In quiescent cells that lack the protective mechanism of PKB-mediated signalling, an alternative mechanism is induced as a consequence of PKB inactivity. This mechanism entails the activation of Forkhead transcription factors, the transcriptional activation of MnSOD and the subsequent reduction of reactive oxygen species. Increased resistance to oxidative stress is associated with longevity. The model of Forkhead involvement in regulating longevity stems from genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans3,4,5,6, and we conclude that this model also extends to mammalian systems."
https://openalex.org/W2169212403,"Modern cryptographic practice rests on the use of one-way functions, which are easy to evaluate but difficult to invert. Unfortunately, commonly used one-way functions are either based on unproven conjectures or have known vulnerabilities. We show that instead of relying on number theory, the mesoscopic physics of coherent transport through a disordered medium can be used to allocate and authenticate unique identifiers by physically reducing the medium's microstructure to a fixed-length string of binary digits. These physical one-way functions are inexpensive to fabricate, prohibitively difficult to duplicate, admit no compact mathematical representation, and are intrinsically tamper-resistant. We provide an authentication protocol based on the enormous address space that is a principal characteristic of physical one-way functions."

https://openalex.org/W1983918344,"The delivery of CD4 help to CD8 + T cell responses requires interactions between CD40 and CD40 ligand and is thought to occur through antigen-presenting cell (APC) activation. Here we show that generation of memory CD8 + T cells displaying an enhanced capacity for cell division and cytokine secretion required CD4 help but not CD40 expression by the APCs. Activated CD4 + and CD8 + T cells expressed CD40; and in the absence of this protein, CD8 + T cells were unable to differentiate into memory cells or receive CD4 help. These results suggest that, like B cells, CD8 + T cells receive CD4 help directly through CD40 and that this interaction is fundamental for CD8 + T cell memory generation."
https://openalex.org/W2050498736,"A new synthetic route to cyclic polymers has been developed in which the ends of growing polymer chains remain attached to a metal complex throughout the entire polymerization process. The approach eliminates the need for linear polymeric precursors and high dilution, drawbacks of traditional macrocyclization strategies, and it effectively removes the barrier to producing large quantities of pure cyclic material. Ultimately, the strategy offers facile access to a unique macromolecular scaffold that may be used to meet the increasing demand of new applications for commercial polymers. As a demonstration of its potential utility, cyclic polyethylenes were prepared and found to exhibit a variety of physical properties that were distinguishable from their linear analogs."
https://openalex.org/W2066069078,"A high-resolution pollen record from western Greece shows that the amplitude of millennial-scale oscillations in tree abundance during the last glacial period was subdued, with temperate tree populations surviving throughout the interval. This provides evidence for the existence of an area of relative ecological stability, reflecting the influence of continued moisture availability and varied topography. Long-term buffering of populations from climatic extremes, together with genetic isolation at such refugial sites, may have allowed lineage divergence to proceed through the Quaternary. Such ecologically stable areas may be critical not only for the long-term survival of species, but also for the emergence of new ones."
https://openalex.org/W2014523162,"Somatically mutated high-affinity autoantibodies are a hallmark of some autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus. It has long been presumed that germinal centers (GCs) are critical in autoantibody production, because they are the only sites currently believed to sustain a high rate of somatic hypermutation. Contrary to this idea, we found that splenic autoreactive B cells in autoimmune MRL.Fas(lpr) mice proliferated and underwent active somatic hypermutation at the T zone-red pulp border rather than in GCs. Our results implicate this region as an important site for hypermutation and the loss of B cell self-tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1997691172,"Interferons (IFNs) are essential for host defense. Although the antiviral effects of the type 1 IFNs IFN-alpha and IFN-beta (IFN-alpha/beta) have been established, their immunoregulatory functions, especially their ability to regulate IFN-gamma production, are poorly understood. Here we show that IFN-alpha/beta activate STAT4 directly (STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription) and that this is required for IFN-gamma production during viral infections of mice, in concert with T cell receptor-derived signals. In contrast, STAT1 appears to negatively regulate IFN-alpha/beta induction of IFN-gamma. Thus, type 1 IFNs, in addition to interleukin-12, provide pathways for innate regulation of adaptive immunity, and their immunoregulatory functions are controlled by modulating the activity of individual STATs."

https://openalex.org/W1972053361,"Conversion of new memories into a lasting form may involve the gradual refinement and linking together of neural representations stored widely throughout neocortex. This consolidation process may require coordinated reactivation of distributed components of memory traces while the cortex is ""offline,"" i.e., not engaged in processing external stimuli. Simultaneous neural ensemble recordings from four sites in the macaque neocortex revealed such coordinated reactivation. In motor, somatosensory, and parietal cortex (but not prefrontal cortex), the behaviorally induced correlation structure and temporal patterning of neural ensembles within and between regions were preserved, confirming a major tenet of the trace-reactivation theory of memory consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W1999603785,"The strength of radiative transitions in atoms is governed by selection rules that depend on the occupation of atomic orbitals with electrons. Experiments have shown similar electron occupation of the quantized energy levels in semiconductor quantum dots--often described as artificial atoms. But unlike real atoms, the confinement potential of quantum dots is anisotropic, and the electrons can easily couple with phonons of the material. Here we report electrical pump-and-probe experiments that probe the allowed and 'forbidden' transitions between energy levels under phonon emission in quantum dots with one or two electrons (artificial hydrogen and helium atoms). The forbidden transitions are in fact allowed by higher-order processes where electrons flip their spin. We find that the relaxation time is about 200 micro s for forbidden transitions, 4 to 5 orders of magnitude longer than for allowed transitions. This indicates that the spin degree of freedom is well separated from the orbital degree of freedom, and that the total spin in the quantum dots is an excellent quantum number. This is an encouraging result for potential applications of quantum dots as basic entities for spin-based quantum information storage."
https://openalex.org/W2002406419,"Upon cooling, the isolated ferromagnetic domains in thin films of La0.33Pr0.34Ca0.33MnO3 start to grow and merge at the metal-insulator transition temperature TP1, leading to a steep drop in resistivity, and continue to grow far below TP1. In contrast, upon warming, the ferromagnetic domain size remains unchanged until near the transition temperature. The jump in the resistivity results from the decrease in the average magnetization. The ferromagnetic domains almost disappear at a temperature TP2 higher than TP1, showing a local magnetic hysteresis in agreement with the resistivity hysteresis. Even well above TP2, some ferromagnetic domains with higher transition temperatures are observed, indicating magnetic inhomogeneity. These results may shed more light on the origin of the magnetoresistance in these materials."
https://openalex.org/W2096071764,"To make messenger RNA transcripts, bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) undergoes a transition from an initiation phase, which only makes short RNA fragments, to a stable elongation phase. We have determined at 2.1 angstrom resolution the crystal structure of a T7 RNAP elongation complex with 30 base pairs of duplex DNA containing a ""transcription bubble"" interacting with a 17-nucleotide RNA transcript. The transition from an initiation to an elongation complex is accompanied by a major refolding of the amino-terminal 300 residues. This results in loss of the promoter binding site, facilitating promoter clearance, and creates a tunnel that surrounds the RNA transcript after it peels off a seven-base pair heteroduplex. Formation of the exit tunnel explains the enhanced processivity of the elongation complex. Downstream duplex DNA binds to the fingers domain, and its orientation relative to upstream DNA in the initiation complex implies an unwinding that could facilitate formation of the open promoter complex."
https://openalex.org/W2015975538,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy preliminary localized in the bone marrow and characterized by its capacity to disseminate. IL-6 and IGF-1 have been shown to mediate proliferative and anti-apoptotic signals in plasmocytes. However, in primary plasma-cell leukemia (PCL) and in end-stage aggressive extramedullar disease, the cytokine requirement for both effects may be not mandatory. This suggests that constitutive activation of signaling pathways occurs. One of the signaling pathways whose deregulation may play an oncogenic role in MM is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) pathway. In human growth factor-independent MM cell lines OPM2 and RPMI8226, we show that the PI 3-K inhibitors LY294002 and Wortmannin strongly inhibited cell proliferation, whereas inhibition of the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR)/P70-S6-kinase (P70(S6K)) pathway with rapamycin or of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway with PD98059 had minimal effect on proliferation. In both cell lines, constitutive activation of the PI 3-K/Akt/FKHRL-1, mTOR/P70(S6K) and MAPK pathways was detected. LY294002 inhibited phosphorylation of Akt, FKHRL-1 and P70(S6K) but had no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that the PI 3-K and MAPK pathways are independent. IGF-1 but not IL-6 increased phosphorylation of Akt, FKHRL-1 and P70(S6K). Purified plasmocytes from four patients with MM and two patients with primary PCL were studied. In three of them including the two patients with PCL, constitutive phosphorylation of Akt, FKHRL-1 and P70(S6K) was present, inhibited by LY294002 and enhanced by IGF-1. In these patients with constitutive Akt activation, normal PTEN expression was detected. PI 3-K inhibition induced caspase-dependent apoptosis as confirmed by inhibition with the large spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and cleavage of pro-caspase-3. Both cell lines spontaneously expressed Skp2 and cyclin D1 proteins at high levels but no p27(Kip1) protein. In the presence of LY294002, cell-cycle arrest in G0/G1 was observed, p27(Kip1) protein expression was up-regulated whereas the expression of both Skp2 and cyclin D1 dramatically diminished. PI 3-K-dependent GSK-3alpha/beta constitutive phosphorylation was also detected in OPM2 cells that may contribute to high cyclin D1 expression. Overall, our results suggest that PI 3-K has a major role in the control of proliferation and apoptosis of growth factor-independent MM cell lines. Most of the biological effects of PI 3-K activation in these cell lines may be mediated by the opposite modulation of p27(Kip1) and Skp2 protein expression. Moreover, constitutive activation of this pathway is a frequent event in the biology of MM in vivo and may be more frequently observed in PCL."

https://openalex.org/W1974721122,"The SecA adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) mediates extrusion of the amino termini of secreted proteins from the eubacterial cytosol based on cycles of reversible binding to the SecYEG translocon. We have determined the crystal structure of SecA with and without magnesium-adenosine diphosphate bound to the high-affinity ATPase site at 3.0 and 2.7 angstrom resolution, respectively. Candidate sites for preprotein binding are located on a surface containing the SecA epitopes exposed to the periplasm upon binding to SecYEG and are thus positioned to deliver preprotein to SecYEG. Comparisons with structurally related ATPases, including superfamily I and II ATP-dependent helicases, suggest that the interaction geometry of the tandem motor domains in SecA is modulated by nucleotide binding, which is shown by fluorescence anisotropy experiments to reverse an endothermic domain-dissociation reaction hypothesized to gate binding to SecYEG."

https://openalex.org/W2132222969,"Persons with the autosomal recessive disorder Bloom syndrome are predisposed to cancers of many types due to loss-of-function mutations in the BLM gene, which encodes a recQ-like helicase. Here we show that mice heterozygous for a targeted null mutation of Blm, the murine homolog of BLM, develop lymphoma earlier than wild-type littermates in response to challenge with murine leukemia virus and develop twice the number of intestinal tumors when crossed with mice carrying a mutation in the Apc tumor suppressor. These observations indicate that Blm is a modifier of tumor formation in the mouse and that Blm haploinsufficiency is associated with tumor predisposition, a finding with important implications for cancer risk in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1503661296,"High-resolution infrared and microwave spectra of He N –carbonyl sulfide (He N -OCS) clusters with N ranging from 2 to 8 have been detected and unambiguously assigned. The spectra show the formation of a solvation layer beginning with an equatorial “donut” of five helium atoms around the OCS molecule. The cluster moment of inertia increases as a function of N and overshoots the liquid droplet limit for N &gt; 5, implying that even atoms in the first solvation shell are decoupled from the OCS rotation in helium nanodroplets. To the extent that this is due to superfluidity, the results directly explore the microscopic evolution of a phenomenon that is formally macroscopic in nature."

https://openalex.org/W2153456878,"Differential gene expression of cell lines derived from a malignant melanoma or its autologous lymph node metastasis using cDNA arrays indicated down-regulation of PRSS11, a gene encoding the serine protease HtrA1, a homolog of the Escherichia coli protease HtrA, in the metastatic line. Stable PRSS11 overexpression in the metastatic cell line strongly inhibited proliferation, chemoinvasion and Nm23-H1 protein expression in vitro, as well as cell growth in vivo in nu/nu mice. A polyclonal anti-HtrA1 serum demonstrated a significantly higher expression in primary melanomas when compared to unrelated metastatic lesions in a human melanoma tissue array, and down-modulation of HtrA1 expression in autologous lymph node melanoma metastases in seven out of 11 cases examined. These results suggest that down-regulation of PRSS11 and HtrA1 expression may represent an indicator of melanoma progression."

https://openalex.org/W2033661691,"Replication origins are ‘licensed' for a single initiation event by loading Mcm2-7 complexes during late mitosis and G1. Licensing is blocked at other cell cycle stages by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases and a small protein called geminin. Here, we describe the effects of over-expressing a non-degradable form of geminin in various cell lines. Geminin expression reduced the quantity of Mcm2 bound to chromatin and blocked cell proliferation. U2OS (p53+/Rb+) cells showed an early S phase arrest with high cyclin E and undetectable cyclin A levels, consistent with the activation of an intra-S checkpoint. Saos2 (p53-/Rb-) cells showed an accumulation of cells in late S and G2/M with approximately normal levels of cyclin A, consistent with loss of this intra-S phase checkpoint. Geminin also induced apoptosis in both these cell lines. In contrast, IMR90 primary fibroblasts over-expressing geminin arrested in G1 with reduced cyclin E levels and no detectable apoptosis. A ‘licensing checkpoint’ may therefore act in primary cells to prevent passage into S phase in the absence of sufficient origin licensing. These results suggest that inhibition of the licensing system may cause cancer-specific cell killing and therefore represent a novel anti-cancer target."

https://openalex.org/W1971936302,"The Polo-like kinases (Plks) are a conserved family of kinases that contribute to cell cycle regulation, particularly in G2 and mitosis. In mammals, there are at least three members of the Plk family. Here we show that Plk3 is a stress response protein that becomes phosphorylated following DNA damage or mitotic spindle disruption. Phosphorylation enhances its kinase activity and is dependent upon ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) in the former case but not the latter. Plk3 associates with complexes of multiple sizes ranging from 150 to greater then 600 kDa. In its unphosphorylated form it elutes from a sizing column at about 400 kDa whereas it associates with complexes of 150 and 600 kDa when phosphorylated. Among the proteins with which it physically associates and utilizes, as substrates are Chk2 and P53. It phosphorylates Chk2 on a residue different from threonine 68 (Thr68), the principal target for ATM. While ATM is necessary for phosphorylation and activation of Chk2 in vivo, Plk3 seems to contribute to its full activation. In its phosphorylated form it also coelutes and forms a complex with unpolymerized tubulin. In aggregate, the data argue that Plk3 is a multifunctional protein that associates with multiple complexes and that contributes to response to stress incurred by DNA damage and mitotic spindle disruption, albeit via different pathways."

The dynamics of this process was investigated with time-lapsed scanning tunneling microscopy. Pure lead crystallites proved extremely resistant to oxidation. Once nucleated by surface impurities, monolayer films of lead oxide grew readily on lead (111) microfacets in an autocatalytic process. The anisotropic growth of orthorhombic lead oxide films (massicot structure) was most rapid along the direction of weakest lead-oxygen bonding, which suggests that the growth edge autocatalyzes oxygen dissociation by providing proximal sites for oxygen dissociation and attachment."
https://openalex.org/W2315386492,"The development and progression of human cancer are believed to be due to the alterations of multiple genes or/and their protein products. For identifying the proteins associated with esophageal cancer, we analysed the protein profiles of 24 pairs of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas/matched adjacent normal epithelia. Microdissection of routinely unstained frozen sections was performed to purify cancerous and epithelial cells. The protein expression profiles were obtained by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Selected proteins dysregulated in tumors were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. Three isoforms of annexin I were detected in normal esophageal mucosa and down-regulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. RT-PCR analysis showed annexin I mRNA levels were significantly reduced in 17 out of 24 carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that annexin I appeared strong positive in all normal epithelia layers except basal cells. In cancer tissues, decreased expression of annexin I was observed in 12 out of 16 well differentiated tumors, 16 out of 17 moderately differentiated tumors, and 3 out of 3 poorly differentiated tumors as compared with the corresponding normal esophageal epithelia. There was a significant correlation between annexin I expression and the status of tumor differentiation. Well differentiated tumors presented stronger immunohistochemical reaction than moderately and poorly differentiated tumors. These data suggested that there existed three different isoforms of annexin I in normal esophageal epithelia, which may be the results of post-translational modification. Down-expression of three annexin I isoforms was a frequent event in esophageal carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2126115591,"Low-temperature thermochronometry reveals regional Late Cenozoic denudation in Fiordland, New Zealand, consistent with geodynamic models showing uplift of the overriding plate during incipient subduction. The data show a northward progression of exhumation in response to northward migration of the initiation of subduction. The locus of most recent uplift coincides with a large positive Bouguer gravity anomaly within Fiordland. Thermochronometrically deduced crustal thinning, anomalous gravity, and estimates of surface uplift are all consistent with approximately 2 kilometers of dynamic support. This amount of dynamic support is in accord with geodynamic predictions, suggesting that we have dated the initiation of subduction adjacent to Fiordland."
https://openalex.org/W2091844229,"Most breast cancers arise from luminal epithelial cells and 25-30% of these tumours overexpress the ErbB-2 receptor. Herein, a non-transformed, immortalized cell system was used to investigate the effects of ErbB-2 overexpression in luminal epithelial cells. The phenotypic consequence of ErbB-2 overexpression is a shortening of the G1 phase of the cell cycle and early S phase entry, which leads to hyperproliferation. We show that this effect was mediated through the up-regulation of cdk6 and cyclins D1 and E, and enhanced degradation and relocalization of p27(Kip1). These changes were effected predominantly through enhanced MAPK signalling, resulting in cdk2 hyperactivation. PI3K signalling also participated in cell cycle progression, since PI3K and MAPK coordinately regulated changes in cyclin D1 and cdk6 expression. Cdk4 activity was not required for cell cycle progression in these cells, and was constitutively inhibited through its association with p16(INK4A). MAPK-dependent induction of p21(Cip1) was also necessary for G1 phase progression, although its degradation by the proteasome was required for S phase entry. These data provide new insights into the complex molecular mechanisms underlying mitogenic cell cycle control in luminal epithelial cells, the cell type relevant to primary breast cancer, and show how ErbB-2 overexpression subverts this normal control."

https://openalex.org/W2073698793,"We investigated the expression of the PLZF gene in purified human hematopoietic progenitors induced to unilineage erythroid, granulocytic or megakaryocytic differentiation and maturation in serum-free culture. PLZF is expressed in quiescent progenitors: the expression level progressively rises through megakaryocytic development, whereas it gradually declines in erythroid and granulopoietic culture. To investigate the role of PLZF in megakaryopoiesis, we transduced the PLZF gene into the erythro-megakaryocytic TF1 cell line. PLZF overexpression upmodulates the megakaryocytic specific markers (CD42a, CD42b, CD61, PF4) and induces the thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR). The proximal promoter of the TpoR gene is activated in PLZF-expressing TF1 cells: in this promoter region, a PLZF DNA-binding site was identified by deletion constructs studies. Interestingly, PLZF and GATA1 proteins coimmunoprecipitate in PLZF-expressing TF1 cells: enforced expression of both PLZF and GATA1 in TF1 cells results in increased upregulation of megakaryocytic markers, as compared to exogenous PLZF or GATA1 alone, suggesting a functional role for the PLZF/GATA1 complex. Our data indicate that PLZF plays a significant stimulatory role in megakaryocytic development, seemingly mediated in part by induction of TpoR expression at transcriptional level. This stimulatory effect is potentiated by physical interaction of PLZF and GATA1, which are possibly assembled in a multiprotein transcriptional complex."

https://openalex.org/W2317432385,"The basic helix-loop-helix factor E2A plays an important role in the development of B and T lymphocytes. In addition, E2a has been implicated as a gene with tumor suppressor activity, since mice deficient for E2a succumb to T cell lymphomas. We have performed retroviral tagging in EmuMyc transgenic mice to identify genes that contribute to lymphomagenesis. The EmuMyc transgenic mouse is a well-established model of a common translocation in human B cell lymphomas. Analyses of the proviral insertion sites in the MuLV-induced lymphomas revealed that a number of T cell lymphomas carried proviral insertions in the promoter region of E2a. These proviral insertions yield hybrid viral-E2a mRNAs resulting in a marked rise in E2A protein levels. The proviral insertions in E2a were predominantly of clonal origin indicating that E2a insertions are early events in these T cell lymphomas. The primary oncogenic effect of E2A is likely to be associated with enhancement of transcription of the c-Myc transgene via binding to the regulatory immunoglobulin enhancers. The results herein thus provide the first evidence that in a specific setting E2A overexpression can contribute to T-lymphomagenesis. This implies that E2a contains oncogenic features in addition to the previously described tumor suppressive properties."

https://openalex.org/W2045382646,"Tg.AC transgenic mice provide a sensitive assay for oncogenic agents and a convenient alternative to the two-stage initiation/promoter model of skin tumorigenesis. Although extensively used, this model has remained in part an enigma since mice that carry the Tg.AC transgene (consisting of v-Ha-Ras driven by an embryonic zeta-globin promoter) would not ordinarily be expected to develop skin and other adult tumors. Cloning and characterizing the inserted transgene has provided an insight into the Tg.AC phenotype. We find that the transgene is inserted into a Line-1 element in such a way as to create extended inverted repeats consisting of both transgene and Line-1 sequences. Such structures would be expected to contribute to the instability of the Tg.AC locus and we suggest that this instability is critical to the Tg.AC phenotype. Further, we strengthen this notion by introducing an inactivating mutation in the murine Wrn gene (a gene important in maintenance of genome stability) and showing that bigenic Tg.AC/Wrn(Deltahel/Deltahel) mice experience an eightfold increase in inactivating germline mutations at the Tg.AC locus. Similarly, Tg.AC/Wrn(Deltahel/Deltahel) mice that retain an intact and thus active Tg.AC locus experience a sharp increase in papillomas as compared to Tg.AC/Wrn(+/+) mice. This work demonstrates a genetic interaction between the instability of the multicopy transgene and the Werner Syndrome gene. From this, we conclude that genetic instability remains a key element in this tumor promoter model."
