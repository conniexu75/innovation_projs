https://openalex.org/W2012687200,"THE regulation of gene activity seems to depend, at least partially, on specific interactions between DNA and protein. In particular, regulation of protein synthesis in bacteria is probably determined by interaction between operator genes and proteins acting as repressors1. It is conceivable that the proteins interact directly with specific sequences of nucleotides in the groove of doublestranded DNA2."

https://openalex.org/W2010542459,"CD44 is a cell surface adhesion molecule for hyaluronan and is implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. Proteolytic cleavage of CD44 plays a critical role in the migration of tumor cells and is regulated by factors present in the tumor microenvironment, such as hyaluronan oligosaccharides and epidermal growth factor. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the proteolytic cleavage on membranes remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that cholesterol depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which disintegrates membrane lipid rafts, enhances CD44 shedding mediated by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) and that cholesterol depletion disorders CD44 localization to the lipid raft. We also evaluated the effect of long term cholesterol reduction using a statin agent and demonstrated that statin enhances CD44 shedding and suppresses tumor cell migration on a hyaluronan-coated substrate. Our results indicate that membrane lipid organization regulates CD44 shedding and propose a possible molecular mechanism by which cholesterol reduction might be effective for preventing and treating the progression of malignant tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2068843607,"Abscisic acid (ABA) has shown efficacy in the treatment of diabetes and inflammation; however, its molecular targets and the mechanisms of action underlying its immunomodulatory effects remain unclear. This study investigates the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR γ) and lanthionine synthetase C-like 2 (LANCL2) as molecular targets for ABA. We demonstrate that ABA increases PPAR γ reporter activity in RAW 264.7 macrophages and increases ppar γ expression in vivo, although it does not bind to the ligand-binding domain of PPAR γ. LANCL2 knockdown studies provide evidence that ABA-mediated activation of macrophage PPAR γ is dependent on lancl2 expression. Consistent with the association of LANCL2 with G proteins, we provide evidence that ABA increases cAMP accumulation in immune cells. ABA suppresses LPS-induced prostaglandin E2 and MCP-1 production via a PPAR γ-dependent mechanism possibly involving activation of PPAR γ and suppression of NF-κB and nuclear factor of activated T cells. LPS challenge studies in PPAR γ-expressing and immune cell-specific PPAR γ null mice demonstrate that ABA down-regulates toll-like receptor 4 expression in macrophages and T cells in vivo through a PPAR γ-dependent mechanism. Global transcriptomic profiling and confirmatory quantitative RT-PCR suggest novel candidate targets and demonstrate that ABA treatment mitigates the effect of LPS on the expression of genes involved in inflammation, metabolism, and cell signaling, in part, through PPAR γ. In conclusion, ABA decreases LPS-mediated inflammation and regulates innate immune responses through a bifurcating pathway involving LANCL2 and an alternative, ligand-binding domain-independent mechanism of PPAR γ activation.

PPAR γ is a nuclear hormone receptor and the molecular target of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of anti-diabetic drugs (8Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M.

Nutr. 1999; 19: 63-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). PPAR γ suppresses the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by antagonizing the activities of transcription factors, such as AP-1, STAT, and NF-κB (10Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar), enhancing nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the activated p65 subunit of NF-κB (11Kelly D. Campbell J.I.

These molecular changes induced by PPAR γ agonists are linked to anti-inflammatory efficacy in mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease, encephalomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and eosinophilic airway inflammation (13Bassaganya-Riera J.

There is also clinical evidence showing that rosiglitazone is efficacious in the treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in humans (16Lewis J.D. Lichtenstein G.R. Deren J.J. Sands B.E.

However, TZDs are unlikely to be adopted for the treatment of chronic inflammation due to their significant side effects, including fluid retention, weight gain, bone fracture, congestive heart failure, and hepatotoxicity (17Nesto R.W. Bell D. Bonow R.O. Fonseca V. Grundy S.M. Horton E.S. Le Winter M. Porte D. Semenkovich C.F. Smith S. Young L.H. Kahn R.

PPAR Res. 2008; 2008: 943614Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast to TZDs, the ABA-mediated activation of PPAR γ can be blocked by inhibiting intracellular cAMP production or protein kinase A (PKA) activity (2Guri A.J. Hontecillas R. Bassaganya-Riera J. Clin. Nutr. 2010; 29: 646-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting that ABA triggers an alternative mechanism of PPAR γ activation. However, no data are available addressing whether ABA activates PPAR γ, like TZDs, by binding to its ligand-binding domain (LBD) or through an alternative mechanism involving indirect interactions with PPAR γ. In addition to PPAR γ, lanthionine C-like receptor 2 (LANCL2) has been proposed as a possible target for ABA in human granulocytes (19Sturla L. Fresia C. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Scarfì S. Usai C. Fruscione F. Magnone M. Millo E. Basile G. Grozio A. Jacchetti E. Allegretti M. De Flora A. Zocchi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28045-28057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). LANCL2 is a member of the LanC-like protein family associated with the plasma membrane through myristoylation (20Landlinger C. Salzer U. Prohaska R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1759-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether the effects of ABA on PPAR γ are initiated via binding to LANCL2. This study characterizes the role of PPAR γ and LANCL2 as molecular targets of ABA in innate immunity, determines the role of PPAR γ in the immune modulatory properties of ABA during LPS-mediated inflammation, characterizes ABA-controlled gene regulatory networks, and elucidates the molecular mechanisms of action underlying the anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties of ABA. A model of PPAR γ for docking was developed based on analysis of various PPAR crystal structures with co-crystallized full agonists downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) (21Berman H.M. Battistuz T. Bhat T.N. Bluhm W.F. Bourne P.E. Burkhardt K. Feng Z. Gilliland G.L. Iype L. Jain S. Fagan P. Marvin J. Padilla D. Ravichandran V. Schneider B. Thanki N. Weissig H. Westbrook J.D. Zardecki C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). PDB code 3ET3 was selected as the primary model with the variable loop between helices H2′ and H3 from PDB code 2F4B used to fill in this missing portion of 3ET3. This structural model was based on re-docking studies and was evaluated to ensure that large scale testing with various compounds would allow for prediction of full agonism. Docking and analysis were conducted with AutoDock 4.2 (22Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput.

Chem. 2010; 31: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (7925) Google Scholar). Additional analysis and image generation was conducted with UCSF Chimera (25Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28368) Google Scholar). The Dundee PRODRG server (26Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4291) Google Scholar) was used to generate a PDB file for ABA, and AutoDock Tools was used to generate PDBQT files for ABA and PPAR γ. Several different docking runs were conducted to assess the plausibility of ABA binding to PPAR γ. AutoDock Vina (27Trott O. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2010; 31: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (7925) Google Scholar) was used to run a broad potential binding site search of the lower half of the PPAR γ LBD. PPAR γ is composed of three layers of α-helices sandwiched together. Helices H4 and H5 of the middle layer mark the boundary between the top and bottom portions. This lower region is characterized by a pocket surrounded by helices H2, H2′, H6, and H12 and portions of helices H3, H7, and H11. This binding cavity has been well established in the literature (28Artis D.R. Lin J.J. Zhang C. Wang W. Mehra U. Perreault M. Erbe D. Krupka H.I. England B.P. Arnold J. Plotnikov A.N. Marimuthu A.

Three different grid box sizes were used, all of which possessed the largest spacing between grid points (1.000 Å) for AutoDock Vina. Each grid box represents the search area for docking. The first box covered the lower half of the LBD where the binding cavity is located. The second box was a reduced version of the first, which excluded most surface interactions and restricted the search to the interior-binding cavity. The final box was reduced in size to cover only the active site of the binding cavity where full agonists bind to induce PPAR γ activation. This last box size was chosen to provide a docking test to assess if ABA could adopt a favorable binding conformation within the known binding site for PPAR γ agonists. A total of 161 poses were returned from these initial docking studies. To complement this initial testing, conventional AutoDock 4.2 methods were used to produce 1000 docking poses with the largest box dimensions and grid point spacing used for the AutoDock Vina test. The 1000 predicted poses were from a total of 10 AutoDock runs with 100 poses predicted for each execution. Another set of 1000 poses was predicted with a similar box size, but with a smaller grid point spacing (0.375 Å) to refine pose prediction. Free energy of binding values for the 2161 poses was evaluated, and binding sites for ABA were evaluated based on clustering of docked conformations. Examining free energy of binding, clustering of docked conformations, and distance measures between key atoms allowed for predictions to be made concerning plausibility of binding. Recently, Sturla et al. (19Sturla L. Fresia C. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Scarfì S. Usai C. Fruscione F. Magnone M. Millo E. Basile G. Grozio A. Jacchetti E. Allegretti M. De Flora A. Zocchi E. J. Biol.

LANCL2 is a member of the eukaryotic lanthionine synthetase component C-like protein family, which is related to the bacterial lanthionine synthetase component C (20Landlinger C. Salzer U. Prohaska R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1759-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To further understand the function of LANCL2 through its structure and to investigate whether ABA activates LANCL2 via direct binding to its extracellular domain, we performed homology modeling of human LANCL2 using the SWISS-MODEL Workspace (30Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6040) Google Scholar). The template used was the crystal structure of human lanthionine synthetase component C-like protein 1 (LANCL1) (2.6 Å resolution, PDB code 3E6U, chain C), which shares 54% sequence identity and 71% sequence similarity with LANCL2 (31Zhang W. Wang L. Liu Y. Xu J. Zhu G. Cang H. Li X. Bartlam M. Hensley K. Li G. Rao Z. Zhang X.C. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1387-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Together, in silico PPAR γ and LANCL2 docking studies were used to generate hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of action of ABA. The ability of ABA to bind to the ligand-binding domain of PPAR γ was assessed experimentally using the Polar ScreenTM PPAR Competitor Assay, Green (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, concentrations of (+)-ABA (Sigma), (−)-ABA (Sigma), and rosiglitazone (Cayman Chemical) ranging from 0.001 to 10 μm were added to wells containing the ligand-binding domain of PPAR γ bound to a fluorescent marker. After 4 h, the ability of each compound to displace the fluorescent ligand, and therefore reduce the polarization values, was assessed using a fluorescent plate reader with 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission. Results are a compilation of four independent experiments. To determine PPAR γ activity, pCMX.PPAR γ expression plasmid and a pTK.PPRE3× luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the peroxisome proliferator responsive element-containing acyl-CoA oxidase promoter were purified using maxi kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). RAW 264.7 macrophages were cultured with DMEM (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and grown until 60–70% confluence. Cells were co-transfected in each well with 0.6 μg plasmid of DNA and 10 ng of pRL reporter control using F-2 transfection reagents (Targeting Systems, Santee, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, transfected cells were seeded into white, opaque 96-well plates (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 25,000 cells/well. To determine NF-κB reporter activity, cells were then transfected with 0.2 μg of pNF-κB reporter and 0.2 μg of pRL reporter control using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were then treated in replicates of eight with rosiglitazone (Ros 1 μm; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), (+)-ABA (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 μm, Sigma), (−)-ABA (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 μm, Sigma), or vehicle (DMSO) and placed in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. After 20 h, cells were harvested in reporter lysis reagent. Luciferase activity, normalized to pRL activity in the cell extracts, was determined by using the Dual-Luciferase II reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) using a Modulus 96-well luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). All values were normalized to control wells to calculate relative luciferase activity. RAW macrophages were transfected with the PPAR γ plasmid as described above with or without LANCL2 siRNA. Specifically, RAW macrophages were co-transfected with 0.2 μg of plasmid DNA and 0.25 μl of LANCL2 siRNA (20 μm) per well using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C, RAW macrophages were treated in replicates of eight with ABA (1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 μm), Ros (1 or 10 μm), or DMSO control and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, RAW macrophages were harvested in reporter lysis reagent, and luciferase activity was determined as described above. LANCL2 mRNA was measured by RT-PCR in control wells to assess the efficiency of knockdown. Bone marrow cells from PPAR γ flfl; MMTV-Cre− (flfl-Cre−), and flfl-Cre+ mice were cultured in DMEM with m-CSF (50 ng/ml) for 7 days. Fresh media with m-CSF was added on day 3. FACS analysis of BMM harvested at day 7 showed that under these conditions ≥90% of cells were CD11b+ F4/80+, corresponding to a macrophage phenotype. Following differentiation, macrophages were directly stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) as described previously for 12 h (32Shirey K.A. Cole L.E. Keegan A.D. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 4159-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). ABA was added to macrophage cultures at a concentration of 2.5 μm. The effect of ABA on LPS/toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), leukotriene B4, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) production by macrophages was examined in cell supernatants 12 h following the LPS challenge by using a commercial PGE2 EIA kit (Cayman Chemicals), a leukotriene B4 competitive binding assay (R&D Systems), and an MCP-1 ELISA (R&D Systems), respectively, per the manufacturer's instructions. PPAR γ flfl; MMTV Cre+ (flfl-Cre+) conditional knock-out mice, lacking functional PPAR γ in all hematopoietic cells, and their flfl-Cre− control littermates in a C57BL/6 background were generated by using the Cre-lox recombination system as described previously (13Bassaganya-Riera J.

Mice were fed control, ABA (100 mg/kg of diet, corresponding to an effective oral dose of 0.2 mg of ABA/mouse/day), or pioglitazone (70 mg/kg diet, 0.14 mg of pioglitazone/mouse/day)-supplemented diets for 36 days and then were challenged with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 375 μg/kg in 0.1 ml of sterile saline solution intraperitoneally to induce systemic inflammation. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and met or exceeded requirements of the USPHS, National Institutes of Health, and the Animal Welfare Act as amended. Spleens were excised from C57BL6/J mice under sterile conditions. Cells were released by disrupting the tissue between frosted glass slides, and red blood cells were lysed with erythrocyte lysis buffer. Splenocytes were enumerated with a Coulter counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and seeded in cRPMI at 1 × 106/ml onto 24-well plates pre-coated with anti-mouse CD3 (5 μg/ml; Pharmingen) and anti-mouse CD28 (1 μg/ml; Pharmingen). After 20 h of incubation in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2, cells were adapted to Hanks' buffered salt solution buffer for 30 min and then stimulated with ABA (0, 0.01, 1, and 10 μm) for 10 min. RAW 264.7 macrophages and BMM obtained as described above were adapted to DMEM without FBS for 12 h and then stimulated with ABA (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 μm) for 10 min. For intracellular assessment of cAMP, cells were harvested into 0.1 m HCl, and the lysates were collected. The cAMP concentration of the lysates was determined using an EIA kit (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI). Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and spleen-derived cells (2 × 105 cells/well) or whole blood cells (10 μl/well) were seeded onto 96-well plates, centrifuged at 4 °C at 3000 rpm for 4 min, and washed with PBS containing 5% FBS and 0.09% sodium azide (FACS buffer). To assess differential monocyte/macrophage subsets, the cells were incubated in the dark at 4 °C for 20 min in FcBlock (20 μg/ml; Pharmingen), then for an additional 20 min with fluorochrome-conjugated primary antibodies anti-F4/80-PE-Cy5 (5 μg/ml, eBioscience), anti-CD11b-Alexa Fluor 700 (2 μg/ml, eBioscience), and anti-TLR-4-PE-Cy7 (2 μg/ml, eBioscience). For lymphocyte assessment, cells were incubated with anti-CD4-FITC (2 μg/ml; Pharmingen), anti-CD8-PerCp-Cy5.5 (2 μg/ml; eBioscience), CD3 PE-Cy5 (2 μg/ml; Pharmingen), anti-TLR-4 PE-Cy7, and anti-IL17A-PE (2 μg/ml; eBioscience) as shown previously (34Bassaganya-Riera J. Misyak S. Guri A.J. Hontecillas R. Cell. Immunol. 2009; 258: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Flow results were computed with a BD LSR II flow cytometer, and data analyses were performed with FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences). After homogenization of spleens, total RNA was extracted and purified using the RNeasy system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen Valencia, CA). The Qiagen RNase-free DNase supplement kit was used to ensure that the RNA was free from DNA contamination. RNA was then processed and labeled according to the standard target labeling protocols, and the samples were hybridized, stained, and scanned per standard Affymetrix protocols at VBI Core Laboratory on Mouse 430 2.0 expression arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). All statistical analyses of the data were performed within the R statistical environment, version 2.9.0 (35Willems F. Vollstedt S. Suter M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2009; 39: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), using Bioconductor packages (36Gentleman R.C. Carey V.J. Bates D.M. Bolstad B. Dettling M. Dudoit S. Ellis B. Gautier L. Ge Y.

Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Raw microarray data from CEL files were read with “affy” package (37Gautier L. Cope L. Bolstad B.M. Irizarry R.A. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (3884) Google Scholar) and pre-processed by gcRMA algorithm (GC Robust Multiarray Average) that performs the following three steps: (i) adjustment of the gene expression signal against the background caused by optical noise and nonspecific binding; (ii) robust multiarray normalization (38Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8483) Google Scholar); and (iii) summarization of the probes belonging to each probe set. Empirical Bayes adjustment was applied, and p values were corrected for multiple testing. Genes associated with p < 0.1 were considered significantly modulated by LPS. The selected list of genes was analyzed with hypergeometric testing that applies Fisher's exact test to find association between interesting genes and membership within the KEGG pathway(s). The microarray data (both raw and normalized) have been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, data set GSE21013). The experiment followed a 2 × 2 factorial design with two factors,. LPS and ABA, each with two levels, absence and presence. Thus, there were four groups of mice as follows: LPS and ABA, LPS and control, no LPS and control, and no LPS and ABA. The design matrix, constructed in the package “limma,” defined coefficients for LPS main effect, ABA main effect, and the interaction effect. Linear modeling discovered 43 probe sets (genes) corresponding to the LPS-ABA interaction. These 43 probe sets were uploaded to IPA8.0 for Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). Total RNA (1 μg) from spleens was used to generate a cDNA template using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) using conditions described previously (13Bassaganya-Riera J. Reynolds K.

Each gene amplicon was purified with the MiniElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and quantitated on an agarose gel by using a DNA mass ladder (Promega). These purified amplicons were used to optimize real time PCR conditions and to generate standard curves in the real time PCR assay. Primer concentrations and annealing temperatures were optimized for the iCycler iQ system (Bio-Rad) for each set of primers using the gradient protocol of the system. PCR efficiencies were maintained between 92 and 105% and correlation coefficients above 0.98 for each primer set during optimization and also during the real time PCR of sample DNA. cDNA concentrations for genes of interest were examined by real time quantitative PCR using an iCycler IQ system by using a previously published protocol (13Bassaganya-Riera J.

However, intrinsic (de novo) or acquired resistance to TAM occurs in a significant proportion of treated patients. To identify genes involved in resistance to TAM, we introduced full-length cDNA expression library into estrogen receptor-positive MCF7 cells and exposed them to a cytotoxic dose of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHTAM). Four different library inserts were isolated from surviving clones. Re-introduction of the genes individually into naive MCF7 cells made them resistant to 4OHTAM. Cells overexpressing these genes had an increase in acidic autophagic vacuoles induced by 4OHTAM, suggesting their role in autophagy. One of them, prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP), was investigated further. Overexpression of PRCP increased cell proliferation, boosted several established markers of autophagy, including expression of LC3-2, sequestration of monodansylcadaverine, and proteolysis of BSA in an ER-α dependent manner, and increased resistance to 4OHTAM. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous PRCP in MCF7 cells increased cell sensitivity to 4OHTAM and at the same time decreased cell proliferation and expression of LC3-2, sequestration of monodansylcadaverine, and proteolysis of BSA. Inhibition of enzymatic activity of PRCP enhanced 4OHTAM-induced cytotoxicity in MCF7 cells. Cells with acquired resistance to 4OHTAM exhibited increased PRCP activity, although inhibition of PRCP prevented development of 4OHTAM resistance in parental MCF7 cells and restored response to 4OHTAM in MCF7 cells with acquired resistance to 4OHTAM. Thus, we have for the first time identified PRCP as a resistance factor for 4OHTAM resistance in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells.

Efforts to develop new chemotherapeutic drugs can be thwarted by the emergence of drug resistance. Insights into the mechanisms of resistance can greatly facilitate development of better, more potent drugs. Knowledge of resistance pathways paves the way to their targeted manipulation to minimize the effects of resistance or to reverse its course. Regulatory pathways involved in drug resistance might also reveal predictive biological markers for resistance, thus allowing rational adjustments of the therapeutic regimen before growth of resistant tumors becomes clinically obvious.

Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Initially thought to act as an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist and inhibit growth of ER-positive tumors, TAM proved to be active against some ER-negative tumors as well, while failing to achieve even temporary remission in other tumors with expressed ER (2Arafah B.M. Griffin P. Gordon N.H. Pearson O.H. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3268-3272PubMed Google Scholar). Dual activity of TAM as an ER inhibitor and a cytotoxic agent explained its effects against ER-negative cells (3Reddel R.R. Murphy L.C. Hall R.E. Sutherland R.L. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 1525-1531PubMed Google Scholar), but the mechanism(s) of intrinsic as well as acquired resistance to TAM turned out to be complex and is not yet fully understood (4Clarke R. Liu M.C. Bouker K.B. Gu Z. Lee R.Y. Zhu Y. Skaar T.C. Gomez B. O'Brien K. Wang Y. Hilakivi-Clarke L.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7316-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Recently, aromatase inhibitors are used as the second-line therapy to block the synthesis of estrogen from precursors in ER-positive postmenopausal women with breast cancer (5Poole R. Paridaens R. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2007; 19: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These drugs can block ER better than selective estrogen receptor modulators, but emerging resistance remains a challenge to breast cancer treatment (6Brodie A. Macedo L. Sabnis G. J. Steroid Biochem.

One of the biological responses of ER-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells to 4OHTAM is autophagy (7Bursch W. Ellinger A. Kienzl H. Török L. Pandey S. Sikorska M. Walker R. Hermann R.S. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1595-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 8Schoenlein P.V. Periyasamy-Thandavan S. Samaddar J.S. Jackson W.H. Barrett J.T.

Schoenlein P.V. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 2977-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), a multistep process that begins with formation of autophagosomes followed by their fusion with lysosomes to produce autolysosomes (10Eskelinen E.L. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Initially, autophagy induced by a cytotoxic dose of 4OHTAM in MCF7 cells was thought to lead to cell death (7Bursch W. Ellinger A. Kienzl H. Török L. Pandey S. Sikorska M. Walker R. Hermann R.S. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1595-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified autophagy as a mechanism for cell survival in response to 4OHTAM treatment. Disruption of the autophagic process by inhibition of autophagosome formation or autolysosomal function led to increased 4OHTAM-induced cell death in TAM-sensitive and TAM-resistant MCF7 cells (8Schoenlein P.V. Periyasamy-Thandavan S. Samaddar J.S. Jackson W.H. Barrett J.T. Autophagy. 2009; 5: 400-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Samaddar J.S. Gaddy V.T. Duplantier J. Thandavan S.P. Shah M. Smith M.J. Browning D. Rawson J. Smith S.B. Barrett J.T. Schoenlein P.V. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 2977-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These findings have redefined the role of autophagy as a mechanism of cell survival in response to 4OHTAM, which is similar to its established role in cell survival after genomic injury, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, nutrient insufficiency, and infection (11Livesey K.M. Tang D. Zeh H.J. Lotze M.T. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2009; 10: 1269-1279PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cecconi F. Levine B. Dev.

In this study, we applied functional selection techniques to identify genes that protect MCF7 cells against the cytotoxic action of 4OHTAM. A full-length cDNA expression library was delivered into MCF7 cells, which were then selected for survival in the presence of the drug. Selection conditions were chosen to approximate clinical settings, with a certain level of estrogen present during TAM therapy. Serum proteins in the medium, including albumin, could sequester TAM (15Lien E.A. Solheim E. Lea O.A. Lundgren S. Kvinnsland S. Ueland P.M. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2175-2183PubMed Google Scholar), thereby reducing its effective concentration. To compensate, concentrations higher than (although comparable with) clinically achievable in tumors were used during functional selection to ensure elimination of unprotected cells (16Clarke R. Leonessa F. Welch J.N. Skaar T.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 25-71PubMed Google Scholar). Four genes were selected, and one of them, prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP), was characterized in detail. PRCP appears to regulate proliferation and autophagy in an ER-α-dependent manner while protecting MCF7 cells against 4OHTAM-induced cytotoxicity. Goat anti-PRCP antibody has been described (17Shariat-Madar Z. Rahimy E. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 289: H2697-H2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mouse polyclonal anti-PRCP antibody, rabbit anti-LC3 antibody, and rabbit anti-Beclin 1 antibody was from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Mouse anti-β-actin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-ER-α antibody was from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). 4OHTAM, MTT, and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) were from Sigma. Z-Pro-Prolinal (ZPP) was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). High molecular weight kininogen and prekallikrein (PK) were from Enzyme Research Laboratory (South Bend, IN). HD-Pro-Phe-Arg-paranitroaniline (S2302) was from DiaPharma (Franklin, OH). Ala-Pro-paranitroaniline was from Bachem (Torrance, CA). DQ-Red-BSA, MitoTracker Red CMXRos, Mitofluor 589, LysoTracker Blue DND-22, and PicoGreen were from Invitrogen. MCF7 (ATCC, HTB-22) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 10 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 6 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 30 μg/ml fungin, and 10 μg/ml plasmocin (both from InvivoGen, San Diego). 4OHTAM (Sigma) was used as 10 mm stock solution in ethanol and stored at −20 °C. MCF7.beclin cells expressing Beclin 1 from a tetracycline-repressible promoter (pTRE/FLAG-Beclin 1) (18Liang X.H. Yu J. Brown K. Levine B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3443-3449PubMed Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. Beth Levine (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). ViraPort® fetal human brain full-length cDNA expression library in pFB vector (Stratagene, CA) was amplified once on solid support. To monitor the efficiency of retroviral infection, a pFB vector with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP, Invitrogen) was used. VSVg-pseudotyped retroviral supernatant for the cDNA library expression was prepared after transient transfection of 293FT cells by Dr. A. Miyanohara (Program in Human Gene Therapy, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA) using a 10:1 mixture of cDNA library- and EGFP-containing constructs. For library transduction, MCF7 cells were plated at 106 per 100-mm plate 24 h prior to infection. Polybrene (1 μg/ml final concentration) was added to the viral supernatant, which was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and added to MCF7 for 24 h. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h, collected, and frozen in aliquots of 106 cells. An aliquot was used to determine the fraction of cells that expressed GFP, and an estimate of library coverage was made. Re-infection experiments with individual clones were performed similarly. The lentiviral pLKO-PRCP shRNA and ER-α shRNA sets were purchased from OpenBiosystems (clone ID TRCN0000050808 for PRCP shRNA1, TRC0000050809 for PRCP shRNA2, and clone ID TRCN0000003300 for ER-α shRNA). The lentiviral packaging and envelop vectors psPAX2 and pMD2.G (Addgene plasmid 12260 and 12259 deposited by Dr. Didier Trono) and the pLKO-control shRNA (Addgene plasmid 1864 deposited by Dr. David M. Sabatini) (19Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5223) Google Scholar) were obtained from Addgene plasmid repository. Lentiviral supernatants for the expression of shRNAs were generated from 293FT cells by co-transfection of shRNA constructs with psPAX2 and pMD2.G packaging and envelope vectors according to the OpenBiosystems protocol. MCF7 cells were infected and selected with puromycin for 2 weeks to establish polyclonal lines. The retroviral EGFP-LC3 construct was generated by two-step PCR amplification. LC3 was first amplified using the pEGFP-LC3 plasmid DNA (Addgene plasmid 24920 deposited by Dr. T. Finkel) (20Kim S.K. Yang J.W. Kim M.R. Roh S.H. Kim H.G. Lee K.Y. Jeong H.G. Kang K.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 45: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) as template and subcloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector using engineered BglII and EcoRI sites. The EGFP-LC3 was subsequently amplified and subcloned into pMSCV-pac retroviral vector with the engineered XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites. Retroviral supernatant was prepared to infect MCF7.beclin cells using the method described previously (21Duan L. Chen G. Virmani S. Ying G. Raja S.M. Chung B.M. Rainey M.A. Dimri M. Ortega-Cava C.F.

Surviving cells were expanded in drug-free media. The screen was performed twice with independent infections. Genomic DNA was prepared using DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, CA); total RNA was prepared using RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion, TX); the first DNA strand was synthesized using RETROscript kit (Ambion, TX). Manufacturers' protocols were followed in each case. Advantage-2 polymerase (Clontech) was used for PCR (38 cycles: 94 °C, 30 s; 59 °C, 20 s; 68 °C, 60 s); vector-specific primers were pFB-F (CCTAGAACCTCGCTGGAAAGGACCTTACAC) and pFB-R (AGAGTCCCGCTCAGAAGAACTCGGATCG). PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, WI) and sequenced using M13 primers. The same procedure was used for RT-PCR with pFB-F and gene-specific primers: B6-R, 5′-GGGACTTACAAATGGGCCAAAGACAC-3′. 103 cells were plated in a 60-mm plate and allowed to recover overnight. The media were then replaced with 4OHTAM-containing media; control plates were replaced with vehicle-containing media. Treatment with 7.5 or 10 μm of TAM lasted for 3 days, although treatment with 5 μm TAM continued for 14 days with media replacement every 2 days; cells were allowed to recover for 2 weeks, fixed with alcohol, and stained with crystal violet (2% w/v) or methylene blue (1% in 50% ethanol). Colonies were counted. Experiments were done in triplicate. 105 cells were plated per 12-well culture dish, treated with 4OHTAM for specified periods of time, trypsinized, combined with floaters, resuspended in ice-cold 100 μm PBS, stained with 10 μm PI/RNase buffer (BD Biosciences) for 15 min in the dark at room temperature, and analyzed by flow cytometry. MitoTracker Red CMXRos (mitochondrial membrane potential) and Mitofluor 589 (mitochondrial mass detection) were added to cells (250 nm final concentration) for 25 min at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator. LysoTracker Blue DND-22 (lysosome/vacuole compartment) was added to cells (800 nm final concentration) for 1.5 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and then analyzed by Flow Cytometry using a Beckman Coulter Epics XL-MCL (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL) with System II version 3.0 software and CYAN (DakoCytomation, CO) and Summit version 3.3 software. The cells were plated in 60-mm dishes (2 × 105 cells/dish) and treated with 4OHTAM for 2 days. The cells were labeled with MDC (0.05 mm in PBS) for 30 min, and the total cells (monolayer or detached) were collected in 300 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated on ice with light agitation for 20 min. Following incubation, the cell suspension was transferred to a black-colored 96-well plate, and fluorescence was determined using a BioTek Mx microplate reader with an excitation of 360 nm and an emission of 520 nm. The cells then underwent three rounds of standard freeze and thaw followed staining with PicoGreen (1:200 dilution in TE buffer, pH 8.0). The fluorescence intensity of PicoGreen was determined using a BioTek Mx microplate reader with an excitation of 480 nm and an emission of 520 nm. The cell number in each well was calculated with a standard cell titration curve of PicoGreen-stained cell lysates, and the relative values of the MDC fluorescence were calculated. The cells were treated with DQ-Red-BSA (10 μg/ml) for 1 h and then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were then trypsinized and resuspended in FACS buffer (10% FBS/PBS). A three laser (405, 633, and 488 nm) LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FACSDiva version 6.1.2 software were used to acquire and analyze the samples. The DQ-Red signal was excited by the 633-nm red laser and collected using a 610/20 bandpass filter. Cells grown in 96-well plates were incubated in phenol red-free culture medium containing 1.2 mm MTT (100 μl/well) at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were then lysed by addition of 100 μl of 10% SDS, 0.01 m HCl to each well and incubation at 37 °C for 12 h. The plates were read for absorbance at 570 nm by a microplate reader. MCF7.beclin cells on glass coverslips were infected with pMSCV-EGFR-LC3 for 2 days and were starved in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 6 h. The cells were mounted on the UptraCruzTM mounting medium and then analyzed by a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope for autophagosomes visualized as EGFR-LC3 dotted structures. The images were converted to binary images, and the numbers of autophagosomes and cell areas were measured using the ImageJ program (National Institutes of Health). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer followed with SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting carried out as described earlier (21Duan L. Chen G. Virmani S. Ying G. Raja S.M. Chung B.M. Rainey M.A. Dimri M. Ortega-Cava C.F. Zhao X. Clubb R.J. Tu C. Reddi A.L. Naramura M. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1555-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The images were recorded by a BioSpectrum 500 imaging system with LM-26 and Biochemi 500 Camera 1/1.2 (UVP, Upland, CA). To determine PRCP activity, the activation of PK to kallikrein by PRCP on cell-bound high molecular weight kininogen was assessed as described previously (22Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17962-17969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Cells (2.5 × 104 cells/well) were grown overnight in 96-well plates. The 4OHTAM-resistant cells (described below) were maintained in medium containing 1 μm 4OHTAM. Confluent monolayers of cells were washed with HEPES-carbonated buffer (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 14.7 mm HEPES, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.1% gelatin, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.1, 37 °C) and blocked with 1% gelatin at 37 °C for 1 h. The substrate HD-Pro-Phe-Arg-paranitroaniline (S2302, 0.8 mm) was used to measure kallikrein production by an increase in absorbance at 405 nm after 1 h of incubation at 37 °C. To determine the effect of the anti-PRCP antibodies on PRCP-dependent PK activation, anti-PRCP antibody was titrated, and the kallikrein activity was measured after addition of the chromogenic substrate (S2302, 0.8 mm) to MCF7 cells and the 4OHTAM-resistant cells. They were then lysed by standard freeze and thaw and stained with PicoGreen for cellular DNA. The relative absorbance was normalized to cellular DNA (ng/well). Data represent the mean ± S.E. of three experiments in triplicate. The statistical analysis for all the experiments was done by one-way ANOVA followed by a two-tailed t test. ViraPort® human fetal brain full-length cDNA library (Stratagene) in pFB vector was used to screen for genes that induced resistance to tamoxifen in MCF7 cells. Four clones resistant to a cytotoxic dose of 4OHTAM (supplemental Fig. 1A) were identified and designated B4, B6, D10, and E5 (supplemental Fig. 1B). Library inserts from these clones were isolated, re-cloned into pFB vector, and individually transduced into naive MCF7 cells (Fig. 1A). Induction of resistance was confirmed by the response of corresponding populations to 4OHTAM as shown by clonogenic assay (Fig. 1, B and C). Isolated library inserts were designated as resistance-inducing genes (RIGs). To gain a better understanding of changes induced by the RIGs, we evaluated cell growth of RIG-expressing populations (Fig. 1D). In drug-free media, proliferation rates of B4 RIG-expressing cells were similar to parental MCF7 cells or EGFP-expressing control. However, proliferation rates for cells expressing B6, D10, and E5 RIGs were higher than the controls (Fig. 1D). In recent studies autophagy was identified as a major response to a cytotoxic dose of 4OHTAM in MCF7 cells (7Bursch W. Ellinger A. Kienzl H. Török L. Pandey S. Sikorska M. Walker R. Hermann R.S.

To determine whether autophagy was affected by the RIGs, we tested the formation of acidic vesicular organelles (AVO), also called acid autophagic vacuoles, one of the morphologic features of autophagy (23Bursch W. Ellinger A. Gerner C. Frohwein U. Schulte-Hermann R. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 926: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 24Scarlatti F. Bauvy C. Ventruti A. Sala G. Cluzeaud F.

AVO can be stained with the acidic dye LysoTracker Blue DND-22. To correlate AVO formation with cell viability, MCF7 cells and the RIGs-expressing cells were treated with 10 μm 4OHTAM and then co-stained with LysoTracker Blue DND-22 for AVO and PI for damaged cells with increased permeability of plasma membrane. An increase in AVO-positive cells and a decrease in PI staining for the RIG-expressing cells compared with control MCF7 cells (Fig. 2, A and B) suggested that development of autophagic vacuoles correlated with improved survival of the RIG-expressing cells. Considering that the autophagic process affected mitochondria (25Goldman S.J. Taylor R. Zhang Y. Jin S. Mitochondrion. 2010; 10: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), both the RIG-expressing and parental cells were co-stained with Blue DND-22 and Mitofluor 589 for the evaluation of mitochondrial mass. All of the RIG-expressing cells showed higher fluorescence intensity of Mitofluor 589 correlated with AVO positivity (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that the RIG-expressing cells contained more AVO and mitochondria. When the cells were also stained with MitoTracker Red CMXRos to measure mitochondrial activity, the parental MCF7 cells showed a significantly higher proportion of cells with reduced CMXRos staining during 4OHTAM treatment compared with the RIG-expressing cells (Fig. 3, C and D). This finding confirmed increased viability of the RIG-expressing cells in response to a toxic dose of 4OHTAM. Increased AVO in the RIG-expressing cells suggested that autophagy was enhanced by the RIGs expression, so we characterized molecular events linked to one of the genes (B6) that encoded isoform A of the PRCP. Experiments were done with a cell line (B6-9) isolated by single-cell cloning from a population of B6-transduced cells with more than a 10-fold increase in PRCP mRNA as detected by quantitative PCR (data not shown). Two bands at ∼58 kDa were detected with the goat anti-PRCP antibody in parental MCF7; the signals of these bands were significantly stronger in B6-9 cells (Fig. 4A), indicating a detectable overexpression of PRCP protein. When short hairpin RNA constructs (shRNA) were introduced into parental MCF7 cells by transduction, a lower signal was observed in populations transduced with PRCP shRNA compared with the control population transduced with scrambled shRNA (Fig. 4B). Similarly, transduction of anti-PRCP shRNA2 (but not scrambled shRNA) into B6-9 cells induced a significant reduction in proteins recognized by anti-PRCP antibodies (Fig. 4C). The mouse anti-PRCP antibody (Abcam) detects three bands. Only the upper and lower bands are detected by the goat anti-PRCP antibody and are decreased in PRCP shRNA-expressing MCF7 and B6-9 cells. Based on these results, we concluded that the two increased bands detected in the B6-9 cell line were the overexpressed PRCP gene products. Next we tested the effects of PRCP shRNA on proliferation of the B6-9 and MCF7 cells. Consistent with enhancement of growth in B6 cells compared with parental MCF7 (Fig. 1D), B6-9 with PRCP shRNA grew slower compared with B6-9 with control shRNA (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, the same effect was noticed for the parental cell, i.e. PRCP shRNAs also decreased proliferation of MCF7 when compared with the cells with control shRNA (Fig. 4E). These results indicated that PRCP influenced proliferation not only in the tamoxifen-resistant derivative but in the parental MCF7 cells as well. The proliferation of B6-9 cells was still dependent on ER-α function as growth of B6-9 cells in medium containing charcoal-stripped FBS was significantly slower than in medium containing regular FBS (Fig. 4F), and knockdown of ER-α (Fig. 4G) led to growth-arrest of B6-9 cells in medium containing regular FBS (Fig. 4H). The MTT assay and clonogenic assay were used to assess response to 4OHTAM in MCF7 and B6-9 cells transduced with the control shRNA and PRCP shRNA. MTT conversion was measured after 3 days of exposure to different concentrations of 4OHTAM. The most significant decrease in MTT OD value was observed for PRCP shRNA-expressing MCF7 cells treated with 5 and 7.5 μm of 4OHTAM (Fig. 4I) compared with control shRNA-expressing MCF7 cells. Fourteen days of treatment with one concentration (5 μm) of 4OHTAM was used for the clonogenic assay, and colonies were stained with methylene blue and quantified. Knockdown of PRCP in MCF7 cells and B6-9 cells significantly reduced colony formation in response to 4OHTAM (Fig. 4, J and K). Results of this experiment also showed reduced colony formation in PRCP shRNA-expressing cells treated with vehicle (Fig. 4J). Similar results were obtained for B6-9 cells (Fig. 4K), implying that basal cell survival and proliferation in drug-free medium are reduced by knockdown of PRCP. Increased AVO in RIGs-expressing cells implied that autophagy played a role in RIGs-mediated resistance to 4OHTAM. To test that, MCF7 and B6-9 cells were treated with 4OHTAM for 3 days, and expression of autophagosome marker LC3 was assessed. B6-9 cells had much higher basal levels of LC3-2 compared with MCF7 cells (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the basal autophagy was more active in B6-9. Treatment with 4OHTAM induced expression of LC3-2 in both cell lines, indicating that autophagy activity increased in response to 4OHTAM. When the same experiment was done using B6-9 cells transduced with control shRNA or PRCP shRNA, the basal LC3-2 level was reduced in the cells with knockdown of PRCP (Fig. 5B). We also determined expression of LC3 in parental MCF7 cells transduced with PRCP shRNA. Both of the PRCP shRNA-expressing cell lines showed decreased basal LC3-2 (Fig. 5C). There was still increased expression of LC3-2 in response to 4OHTAM in PRCP knockdown cells (Fig. 5, B and C), indicating that 4OHTAM-induced autophagy involves other regulatory mechanisms. MDC sequestration was measured to test the effects of PRCP on autophagosome formation and maturation (Fig. 5, D and E). The results showed that sequestration was significantly higher in B6-9-control shRNA cells compared with MCF7-control shRNA cells and B6-9-PRCP shRNA cells (Fig. 5D). Conversely, MDC sequestration is lower in MCF7 cells expressing PRCP shRNA (Fig. 5E). 4OHTAM treatment did not affect the difference (Fig. 5, D and E). LC3-2 and MDC sequestration were increased in 4OHTAM-treated cells, confirming that PRCP regulates basal a"

Activation of Rho proteins is controlled precisely by multiple regulators in a spatiotemporal manner. RhoA and/or RhoC are key players that regulate the metastatic activity of malignant tumor cells, and it is therefore of particular interest to understand how activation of these Rho proteins is controlled. We recently identified an upstream regulator of RhoA activation, p27RF-Rho (p27kip1 releasing factor from RhoA) that acts by freeing RhoA from inhibition by p27kip1. p27kip1 is a cell cycle regulator when it is localized to the nucleus, but it binds RhoA and inhibits activation of the latter when it is localized to the cytoplasm. Here, we show that a metastatic variant of mouse melanoma B16 cells (F10) exhibits greater expression of p27RF-Rho, RhoA, and RhoC than the nonmetastatic parental cells (F0). Injection of F10 cells into mouse tail vein resulted in the formation of metastatic lung colonies, whereas prior knockdown of expression of either one of the three proteins using specific shRNA sequences decreased metastasis markedly. p27RF-Rho regulated the activation of RhoA and RhoC and thereby modulated cellular adhesion and motility, in addition to pericellullar proteolysis. The Rho activities enhanced by p27RF-Rho had a marked effect upon efficiency of lodging of F10 cells in the lung, which represents an early step of metastasis. p27RF-Rho also regulated metastasis of human melanoma and fibrosarcoma cells. Thus, p27RF-Rho is a key upstream regulator of RhoA and RhoC that controls spreading of tumor cells.

https://openalex.org/W2043645892,"In sickle cell anemia, reticulocytes express enhanced levels of α4β1 integrin that interact mainly with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and fibronectin, promoting vaso-occlusion. These interactions are known to be highly sensitive to the inflammatory chemokine IL-8. The Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) modulates the function of inflammatory processes. However, the link between α4β1 activation by chemokines and DARC erythroid expression is not or poorly explored. Therefore, the capacity of α4β1 to mediate Duffy-negative and Duffy-positive sickle reticulocyte (SRe) adhesion to immobilized vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and fibronectin was evaluated. Using static adhesion assays, we found that, under basal conditions, Duffy-positive SRe adhesion was 2-fold higher than that of Duffy-negative SRes. Incubating the cells with IL-8 or RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) increased Duffy-positive SRe adhesion only, whereas Mn(2+) increased cell adhesion independently of the Duffy phenotype. Flow cytometry analyses performed with anti-β1 and anti-α4 antibodies, including a conformation-sensitive one, in the presence or absence of IL-8, revealed that Duffy-positive and Duffy-negative SRes displayed similar erythroid α4β1 expression levels, but with distinct activation states. IL-8 did not affect α4β1 affinity in Duffy-positive SRes but induced its clustering as corroborated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Our results indicate that in Duffy-negative SRes α4β1 integrin is constitutively expressed in a low affinity state, whereas in Duffy-positive SRes α4β1 is expressed in a higher chemokine-sensitive affinity state. This activation state associated with DARC RBC expression may influence the intensity of the inflammatory responses encountered in sickle cell anemia and participate in its interindividual clinical expression variability."

https://openalex.org/W1973018427,"The abundant expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a hallmark of chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Prolonged inflammation can lead to inflammatory bowel disease. TNF biosynthesis is regulated both at transcription and posttranscriptional levels. However, the stimulation-induced increase in translation rate is much larger. This might indicate the possibility of a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism. How, during basal conditions, is the free concentration of TNF tightly regulated at low levels? The stability and translational efficiency of TNF transcript are regulated by an AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3'-UTR of messenger RNA. A transacting protein, TTP, binds to ARE and enhances the mRNA turnover. Here, we examine a proposal that TNF homeostasis is regulated by a TTP-TNF interaction loop at the posttranscriptional level. We propose a computational framework of this regulatory loop by modeling the role of AREs in mediating the messenger RNA stability and translation. This posttranscriptional regulatory loop between TTP and TNF is composed of two feedback loops (i.e. positive and negative). The mutual interaction of these feedback loops regulates the biosynthesis response of TNF during basal and inflammatory conditions. Here, we also propose an explanation for why the p38 inhibitors become insensitive for TTP knock-out mice."

The uniqueness of the pouch as a site for transplantation results from the alymphatic structure and the very slow diffusion of large molecules out of the pouch area2. The large mass of loose connective tissue which comprises most of the pouch may be responsible for limiting the diffusion of transplantation antigens. Its selection as a favourable site for tumour transplantation has been based not only on its immunological responses, but also on its simplified structure, the ease with which transplants vascularize, the accuracy with which growth rates and regressions can be measured, and the fact that repeated eversion of the pouch for observation of transplants creates little or no trauma to host tissue or transplant."
