https://openalex.org/W2121535505,"Mature human aorta contains a 70-kDa versican fragment, which reacts with a neoepitope antiserum to the C-terminal peptide sequence DPEAAE. This protein therefore appears to represent the G1 domain of versican V1 (G1-DPEAAE441), which has been generated in vivo by proteolytic cleavage at the Glu441-Ala442 bond, within the sequence DPEAAE441-A442RRGQ. Because the equivalent aggrecan product (G1-NITEGE341) and brevican product (G1-EAVESE395) are generated by ADAMTS-mediated cleavage of the respective proteoglycans, we tested the capacity of recombinant ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 to cleave versican at Glu441-Ala442. Both enzymes cleaved a recombinant versican substrate and native human versican at the Glu441-Ala442 bond and the mature form of ADAMTS-4 was detected by Western analysis of extracts of aortic intima. We conclude that versican V1 proteolysis in vivocan be catalyzed by one or more members of the ADAMTS family of metalloproteinases.

We conclude that versican V1 proteolysis in vivocan be catalyzed by one or more members of the ADAMTS family of metalloproteinases. Versican is a member of the family of large aggregating proteoglycans, which also includes aggrecan, neurocan, and brevican. Although aggrecan is most abundant in cartilages (1Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Midura R.J. Yanagishita M. Methods Enzymol... 1994; 230: 390-417Google Scholar) and both neurocan and brevican are largely restricted to nervous tissues (2Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 10119-10126Google Scholar), versican has a rather wide tissue distribution (3Bode-Lesniewska B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Odermatt B.F. Briner J. Heitz P.U. Zimmermann D.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem... 1996; 44: 303-312Google Scholar). It has been identified in loose connective tissues and in fibrous, articular, and elastic cartilages. It is also detectable in the central and peripheral nervous system, in the epidermis, and in all three wall layers of veins and elastic arteries. Furthermore, versican can exist in a number of isoforms, namely V0, V1, V2, V3, and Vint (4Ito K. Shinomura T. Zako M. Ujita M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 958-965Google Scholar, 5Zako M.

Braun K.R. Maurel P. Kaplan E.D. Schwartz S.M. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol... 1999; 19: 1630-1639Google Scholar). The V1 isoform is composed of a G1 domain, chondroitin sulfate (CS)1 attachment domain (GAG-beta) and the G3 domain. The V0 and V1 isoforms differ only by the presence of the GAG-alpha domain in the V0 form, which adds 987 amino acids and about five putative CS-attachment sites, adjacent to the hyaluronan binding domain (4Ito K. Shinomura T. Zako M. Ujita M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 958-965Google Scholar, 6Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 32992-32998Google Scholar). The V2 isoform, which is a predominant brain proteoglycan (8Schmalfeldt M. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 15758-15764Google Scholar), is composed of the G1 domain, GAG-alpha domain, and the G3 domain. Both V0 and V1 are detected at the mRNA level in the human aorta, and versican is also detected in the aorta by immunohistochemistry with antibodies recognizing both variants (3Bode-Lesniewska B.

Matrix Biol.. 1994; 14: 213-225Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent data show that cultured smooth muscle cells contain mRNA for V0, V1, and V3 isoforms (7Lemire J.M. Braun K.R. Maurel P. Kaplan E.D. Schwartz S.M. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol... 1999; 19: 1630-1639Google Scholar). In contrast to aggrecan, for which the degradative pathways have been described in detail (10Sandy J.D. Thompson V. Doege K. Verscharen C. Biochem. J... 2000; 351: 161-166Google Scholar), very little is known regarding versican turnover. A 66-kDa protein, which is immunologically related to versican, has been described in fetal human skin (11Sorrell J.M. Carrino D.A. Baber M.A. Caplan A.I. Anat. Embryol... 1999; 199: 45-56Google Scholar). However, the metabolic origin of this protein was not described. On the other hand, the findings (2Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 10119-10126Google Scholar, 12Sandy J.D. Boynton R.E. Flannery C.R. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 8198-8205Google Scholar) that both aggrecan and brevican are degradedin vivo by glutamyl endopeptidases, which appear to belong to the ADAMTS family of metalloproteinases (13Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 556-562Google Scholar, 14Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R. Rosenfeld S.A.

Chem... 1999; 274: 23443-23450Google Scholar), suggested to us that versican might also be degraded in this manner. In this paper we provide the first evidence that versican is indeed processed in vivo by a glutamyl endopeptidase that appears to belong to the ADAMTS family. Abdominal aorta was anonymously obtained from an organ donor with approval from the University of Washington human subjects review committee. During preparation of the organs for transplantation, excess aortic tissue was trimmed from around the entry point of the celiac artery. This tissue was kept in University of Wisconsin solution (16Wahlberg J.A. Southard J.H. Belzer F.O. Cryobiology.. 1986; 23: 477-482Google Scholar) at 4 °C until the tissue was either frozen intact in liquid nitrogen or dissected on ice in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline with proteinase inhibitors (10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm AEBSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) into the intimal, medial, and adventitial layers. Tissue samples (100–500 mg of wet weight) were frozen for storage and immediately after thawing were extracted twice for 24 h in 1 ml of 4 m guanidine-HCl, 10 mm MES, 50 mmsodium acetate, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm AEBSF, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 0.3 m aminohexanoic acid, 15 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 6.8, at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 ×g at 4 °C. The clear supernatants were combined (1.5–2.0 ml), and three volumes of ice-cold ethanol/5 mm sodium acetate were added. After 16 h at −20 °C, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was dried, dissolved in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, and deglycosylated by digestion for 1.5 h at 37 °C with chondroitinase ABC (25 milliunits/100 μg of GAG, protease-free, Seikagaku). Versican was prepared from human smooth muscle cell-conditioned medium after labeling with [35S]methionine for 24 h as described previously (17Olin K.L. Potter-Perigo S. Barrett P.H. Wight T.N. Chait A. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 34629-34636Google Scholar). Antiserum DPEAAE (abbreviated to anti-DP in the text below) was raised in rabbits against the synthetic peptide CGGDPEAAE conjugated to ovalbumin (by Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL), and the antibodies were affinity-purified on a peptide-substituted Sulfolink column from Pierce and Co. Anti-CDAGWLADQTVRYPI (also called HAL) was obtained from Dr. Steve Carlson; this antiserum is known to detect a 21-residue sequence, which begins with CDAG and is present in the proteoglycan tandem repeat loops of the G1 domain of aggrecan, versican, and also in link protein (18Sandy J.D. Plaas A.H. Koob T.J. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl... 1995; 266: 26-32Google Scholar). Anti-G1 (aggrecan) was raised in rabbits against bovine aggrecan G1 domain supplied by Dr. Larry Rosenberg. LF-99 (raised to the N-terminal 13-residue peptide sequence of human versican) was from Dr. Larry Fisher (19Fisher L.W. Stubbs 3rd, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl... 1995; 266: 61-65Google Scholar), and the antiserum Vc (raised to recombinant human versican V1 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells) was from Dr. Richard Le Baron (20du Cros D.L. LeBaron R.G. Couchman J.R. J. Investig. Dermatol... 1995; 105: 426-431Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for the GAG-alpha domain and the GAG-beta domain of human versican have been previously described (6Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 32992-32998Google Scholar, 21Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Schubert M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol... 1994; 124: 817-825Google Scholar). The anti-His tag antibody was from RDI Research Diagnostics. The anti-human TS-4 antiserum was raised in rabbits by injection of the synthetic peptide CYNHRTDLFKSFPGP, conjugated to ovalbumin (by Research Genetics); this peptide represents residues 590–603 of human ADAMTS-4. Western analysis was done on Novex Mini-gels under reducing conditions with primary antibodies at between 1:1000 and 1:3000 dilution followed by ECL detection as previously described (18Sandy J.D. Plaas A.H. Koob T.J. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl... 1995; 266: 26-32Google Scholar, 22Sandy J.D. Gamett D. Thompson V. Verscharen C. Biochem. J... 1998; 335: 59-66Google Scholar). For identification of the V0 and V1 isoforms of versican, SDS-PAGE was run on 16- × 18-cm gels. Pieces of human abdominal aorta from organ donors were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight at 4 °C. After being embedded in paraffin, transverse sections 8 μm thick were cut and used for immunohistochemical staining by the streptavidin-biotin/horseradish peroxidase method (Vectastain Elite ABC, Vector Laboratories) with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine plus nickel chloride as a chromogen. The affinity-purified anti-DP was used at 10 ng of IgG/ml, the versican (Vc) antiserum was used at 1:400, and the biotinylated goat anti-rabbit conjugate (Vector Laboratories) was used at 1:400. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The alignment and consensus sequences for the enzyme cleavage sites were generated using Multalin version 5.3.2 (23Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res... 1988; 16: 10881-10890Google Scholar) with a gap weight of 12, gap length weight of 2, and consensus levels of high = 90% and low = 50%. The proposed cleavage sites were identified using PattInProt version 5.4 with searches having a minimum similarity level of 70%. Recombinant human ADAMTS-1 was expressed and purified as previously described (24Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Milchanowski A.B. Dufour E.K. Leduc R. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 33471-33479Google Scholar). Purified rhADAMTS-4 was a generous gift from Genetics Institute, Boston, MA. Preparation of the substrate recombinant fragment A by expression of the Gly357-Asp567 portion of the GAG-beta domain of versican V1 in Escherichia coli has been described (21Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Schubert M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol... 1994; 124: 817-825Google Scholar). The 230-residue substrate (shown below) includes a 21-residue leader sequence, including an His-Tag and protease X cleavage site spliced to the Gly357-Asp567 versican peptide. The ADAMTS clip site at Glu441-Ala442 is shown as follows.

For ADAMTS digestion, the GAG-beta substrate was first dialyzed against water for 4 h to remove phosphate-buffered saline. Then GAG-beta was incubated with ADAMTS (1 μg of proteinase per 20 μg of substrate) in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris, 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 16 h and digests (10 μg for Western analysis or 20 μg for Coomassie Blue) were analyzed on 4–20% SDS gels (Invitrogen). For digestion of native substrates, 10 μg of versican-rich protein purified as above from human aortic intima (estimated from Coomassie-stained gel at about 3 μg of versican core protein) or 40 μg of rat chondrosarcoma aA1D1 (a gift from Dr. Jim Kimura) was incubated with ADAMTS-1 or ADAMTS-4 in 100 μl 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 16 h. The samples were then chondroitinase-digested as above, dried, and run on 4–12% SDS gels (Invitrogen) for Western analysis.

Chem... 1994; 269: 10119-10126Google Scholar, 27Matthews R.T. Gary S.C. Zerillo C. Pratta M. Solomon K. Arner E.C. Hockfield S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 22695-22703Google Scholar) is shown in thetop alignment in Table I. The substrate length for the alignment was based on the cleavage sequences located within the “gap” regions between the clusters of chondroitin sulfate chains in the CS-2 domain of aggrecan and thus support the view that these “nodal” regions may represent proteolytically sensitive sites (28Hering T.M. Kollar J. Huynh T.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys... 1997; 345: 259-270Google Scholar). Most importantly, this alignment suggests that the activity of the ADAMTS proteinases toward aggregating proteoglycans is promoted by an extended motif found in the 23 residues on the upstream side of the scissile bond along with a short 3-residue stretch on the downstream side of the bond. A rather loose consensus sequence for cleavage is apparent as pt(V/I)XX(V/I)(t/d)XXlvEXvtpXXXXeXE*Xrg, where the asterisk represents the scissile bond,uppercase residues are 100% conserved, lowercase residues are 50% or more conserved, and X represents nonconserved residues. Using a search string of [P]-X-[VI]-X-X-[VI]-X-X-X-X-X-[E]-X-[PVQ]-X-[PQAE]-X(5,6)-[E]-[ASGL] based on this consensus, the sequences of the known isoforms of human versican were inspected for evidence of potential “aggrecanase-like” cleavage sites.Table IAlignment and consensus sequence of the known ADAMTS cleavage sites for aggrecan and brevican (top) and the versican cleavage sites described in this report (bottom)Known cleavage sitesSequencesHuAgg (Glu373)I T V Q T V T W P D M E L P L P R N I T E G E A R G S VHuAgg (Glu1539)P T V S L V D S T L V E V V T A S T A S E L E G R G T IHuAgg (Glu1714)S G I T F V D T S L V E · V A P T T F K E E E G L G S V1-a· = residues conserved for less than 50%.HuAgg (Glu1819)P T V S L V D R T L V E S V T Q A P T A Q E A G E G PHuAgg (Glu1919)P E V T L I T S E F V E G V T E P T I S Q E L G Q R PRatBrev (Glu395)E A I V T V T E K L E E L Q L P Q E A V E S E S R G A IConsensusp t ! 1 ! % 1 v E v t p e E r g1-b! = I or V.1-c% = T or D.1-dE = P1 cleavage residue.Proposed versican cleavage sitesSequencesHuVerV1 (Glu441)T P S V Q Y I N G K H L V T T V P K D P E A A E A R R G QHuVerV0 (Glu1428)T P S V Q Y I N G K H L V T T V P K D P E A A E A R R G QHuVerV0 (Glu405)P L V D E L P V I P T E F P P V G N I V S F E Q K A T VHuVerV2 (Glu405)P L V D E L P V I P T E F P P V G N I V S F E Q K A T VUpper case, residue conserved 100%; lower case, residue conserved for 50% to less than 100%.1-a · = residues conserved for less than 50%.1-b ! = I or V.1-c % = T or D.1-d E = P1 cleavage residue. Open table in a new tab Upper case, residue conserved 100%; lower case, residue conserved for 50% to less than 100%. This approach suggested the presence of a very likely cleavage site in the GAG-beta region at the Glu441-Ala442 bond in V1 versican and at the equivalent Glu1428-Ala1429 site in V0 versican (see TableI, lower alignment). The likelihood of such a cleavage site at Glu441 in V1 versican was strengthened by the fact that the position of this site relative to the N terminus of the protein is similar to the location of the known cleavage sites in aggrecan at Glu373 and brevican at Glu395. The same search strategy also suggested a likely cleavage site at Glu405-Gln406 in the GAG-alpha region of both the V0 and V2 isoforms of versican (see Table I), and studies on thein vivo localization of the product of this cleavage will be described elsewhere. Because the anti-NITEGE neoepitope antiserum has been widely used previously (18Sandy J.D. Plaas A.H. Koob T.J. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl... 1995; 266: 26-32Google Scholar, 29Lark M.W. Gordy J.T.

J. Clin. Invest... 1996; 98: 2292-2299Google Scholar) to specifically detect the aggrecanase-generated species G1-NITEGE373, it seemed likely that an equivalent antiserum to the putative versican neoepitope sequence DPEAAE would be capable of detecting the equivalent G1-DPEAAE441 versican product. We therefore generated a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to the ovalbumin-conjugated peptide CGGDPEAAE. Cultures were labeled for 24 h with [35S]methionine, and the proteoglycans were isolated from the culture medium by DEAE cellulose chromatography (17Olin K.L. Potter-Perigo S. Barrett P.H. Wight T.N. Chait A. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 34629-34636Google Scholar) and digested with chondroitinase ABC for analysis on a 16- × 18-cm, 4–12% gradient gel (Fig.1 A). Autoradiography (lane 1) showed the presence of two major very high molecular mass products (bands 1 and 2), which migrated in the 350- to 400-kDa range. On Western analysis both of these products were reactive with anti-Vc (lane 2), LF99 (lane 3), and the anti-GAG-beta antiserum (lane 5), whereas only band 1 reacted with the GAG-alpha antiserum (lane 4). When taken together with the established specificity of these antisera (6Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 32992-32998Google Scholar, 21Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Schubert M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol... 1994; 124: 817-825Google Scholar), these results identifyband 1 as the V0 isoform and band 2 as the V1 isoform of versican. Portions of a similar proteoglycan preparation from human smooth muscle cells (9Yao L.Y. Moody C. Schonherr E. Wight T.N. Sandell L.J. Matrix Biol.. 1994; 14: 213-225Google Scholar) were separated on a 4–12% Mini-gel system for Western analysis with four different antisera, namely Vc, HAL, LF99, and DP (Fig. 1 B). A single major high molecular mass species (labeled as band 2) was present, and this was highly reactive with Vc (lane 1), reactive with HAL (lane 2), and very weakly reactive with LF99 (lane 3). With Vc and HAL there was also evidence for the presence of a low abundance but discrete immunoreactive product (labeled as band 1), which migrated more slowly than band 2. It seems likely thatband 1 and band 2 represent versican isoforms V0 and V1, respectively (as shown in A); however, it is also possible that V0 and V1 did not separate effectively on this Mini-gel system. In addition to full-length versican, the Vc antiserum (Fig.1 B, lane 1) also detected abundant products in the 180- to 300-kDa range, and the LF-99 antiserum (Fig. 1 B,lane 3) detected products at about 70 and 120 kDa, but none of these were further studied. The DP antiserum (Fig. 1 B,lane 4) showed no reactivity with any species in the smooth muscle cell versican preparation, demonstrating that the antibody does not react with the DPEAAE sequence when it is present in intact versican (band 2). Furthermore, the DP antiserum did not react with any of the Vc-reactive fragments that migrated between 180 and 300 kDa, suggesting that they are generated by proteolysis of versican at sites other than the Glu441-Ala442site. To examine the structure of versican in human aorta we next analyzed extracts of whole aorta and of the intima, media, and adventitia on the Mini-gel system. The general pattern of immunoreactive products with each of the four antisera (Vc, HAL, LF99, and DP) was similar in each zone of aorta, so only the results with intima are shown (Fig. 1 C). Intact versican (labeled asband 2, probably the V1 isoform) was the only detectable very high molecular mass product. This was highly reactive with Vc (lane 1) and also weakly reactive with HAL (lane 2). The absence of detectable reactivity of band 2 with LF99 in this sample (lane 3) is probably due to the poor reactivity of this antiserum relative to Vc and HAL (see Fig.1 B). The Vc antiserum (lane 1) also detected abundant species in the 160- to 300-kDa range, which appeared similar to those in the smooth muscle cell-conditioned medium (Fig.1 B, lane 1), however, these have not been identified. Of particular interest was the finding that a 70-kDa band (labeled as band 4 on Fig. 1 C) was detected with Vc (very weakly), HAL, and LF-99, and this species exhibited very strong reactivity with the neoepitope antiserum DP (lane 4). The migration behavior and immunoreactivity profile of this product suggested that it represents the G1-DPEAAE441 cleavage product of human versican V1 predicted from the consensus cleavage site search strategy (Table I). In addition, a low abundance but discrete DP-reactive product at about 220 kDa (labeled as band 3) was also seen in these extracts, and its properties are consistent with the G1-DPEAAE1428 species generated by cleavage of the versican V0 isoform at the same site in the GAG-beta domain. The relatively low abundance of band 3 relative to band 4 is consistent with the very low apparent abundance of V0 relative to V1 versican in these samples. The specificity of immunoreactivity of theband 3 and band 4 products was confirmed by showing that the reactivity of both species was eliminated by preadsorption of the antiserum with the immunizing peptide CGGDPEAAE at 10 μm concentration for 2 h (Fig. 1 C,lane 5). The band at about 60 kDa in lanes 2–5appears to be nonspecific. Because of the possibility of false positives with affinity-purified C-terminal neoepitope antisera (18Sandy J.D. Plaas A.H. Koob T.J. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl... 1995; 266: 26-32Google Scholar), we tested antiserum DP against a wide range of aggrecan preparations. ADAMTS-generated fragments with the C-terminal sequences TASELE, TFKEEE, APTAQE, PTVSQE, and NITEGE (10Sandy J.D. Thompson V. Doege K. Verscharen C. Biochem. J... 2000; 351: 161-166Google Scholar, 18Sandy J.D. Plaas A.H. Koob T.J. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl... 1995; 266: 26-32Google Scholar, 22Sandy J.D. Gamett D. Thompson V. Verscharen C. Biochem. J... 1998; 335: 59-66Google Scholar) did not react with the affinity-purified DP under Western blot conditions in which they reacted strongly with their cognate antisera (results not shown). Immunostaining with Vc and DP (Fig.2) of sections prepared from the same human aorta samples used for the Western analyses (Fig. 1) showed a similar distribution for the two epitopes. In this sample, both the total versican (Vc) and the truncated product(s) (DPEAAE) appeared to be most abundant in the intima, detectable in patches in the media, and difficult to detect in the adventitia. The same immunohistochemical analysis of four additional human aorta samples (which ranged from normal with diffuse intimal thickening to a vessel with atherosclerotic lesions), showed that the vast majority of both the Vc-reactive and DP-reactive species were present in the intima and media. Because the human aorta extracts contained versican fragments with strong and specific immunoreactivity to the DP antiserum, we examined the possibility that the C-terminal at DPEAAE441 can be generated by digestion of versican with ADAMTS proteinases. For this purpose we incubated purified recombinant human ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 with a recombinant human versican GAG-beta domain substrate and examined the products by Coomassie staining on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The substrate preparation (lane 1) ran as a single major Coomassie-stained band of about 50 kDa, which represents the full-length substrate (band 1). Digestion with ADAMTS-1 (lane 2) eliminated much of the substrate and generated a major stained product of about 28 kDa (band 2), which appeared as a doublet, and a minor stained product at about 18 kDa (band 3). Under the same conditions the ADAMTS-4 (lane 3) eliminated more of the substrate than the ADAMTS-1 digestion but generated the same two product bands (bands 2 and3). To further characterize these digestion products another set of incubations were used for Western analysis with the general GAG-beta antiserum and the specific neoepitope DP antiserum (Fig.4). The 50-kDa substrate (band 1) reacted strongly with the GAG-beta antiserum (lane 1) and also, unexpectedly, reacted weakly with the DP antiserum (lane 2). After digestion with either ADAMTS-1 (lane 3) or ADAMTS-4 (lane 6) the GAG-beta-reactive substrate was completely eliminated, and two GAG-beta-reactive products were obtained at about 28 kDa (band 2) and 18 kDa (band 3), which corresponded in migration behavior to the Coomassie-stained products labeled as band 2 and band 3 (Fig. 3). When these digests were analyzed with the DP antiserum (lanes 4 and 7) only the 28-kDa band (band 2) was reactive, identifying this as the N-terminal fragment with a C-terminal at Glu441. In addition, the DP reactivity of the 28-kDa fragment generated by ADAMTS-1 was eliminated by preadsorption of the antiserum with the immunizing peptide (lane 5). Another TS-4 digest was also analyzed with the GAG-beta antiserum, anti-DP, and an anti-His-tag antibody. On image overlay, the results (not shown) confirmed that the slower of the GAG-beta-positive products (band 2, Fig. 4) reacted with both anti-DP and the anti-His tag antibodies, whereas the faster of the GAG-beta-positive products (band 3, Fig. 4) reacted with neither of these antibodies. Taken together, these data clearly show that both ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 are capable of cleaving the 50-kDa versican substrate at the Glu441-Ala442 bond to generate an N-terminal fragment of 105 residues (band 2, which migrates at about 28 kDa) and a C-terminal fragment of 125 residues (band 3, which migrates at about 18 kDa). The reason for the anomalous migration behavior of the band 2 and band 3products, with respect to their predicted molecular masses, is unknown. To confirm the identity of the products of ADAMTS digestion of the recombinant GAG-beta substrate, another set of digests with both ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry and m/z values generated from two separate digestions, calibrated both externally and internally using egg ovalbumin and α-lactalbumin. The predicted molecular weight for the full-length GAG-beta substrate is 25651.5, and the two products expected from cleavage at the Glu441-Ala442 bond alone are 11844.8 (N-terminal product), and 13824.7 (C-terminal product). The digest with ADAMTS-1 contained a peak at m/z 25697 ± 108, which corresponds to undigested full-length GAG-beta substrate. This peak was not seen in the ADAMTS-4 digest consistent with our general observation of more complete digestion with TS-4. The digests with both enzymes contained products that were very close to the theoretical size for the C-terminal fragment; the ADAMTS-1 product was at m/z 13841 ± 17 and the ADAMTS-4 product at m/z 13848 ± 21. There were several peaks in the region of both spectra near the position of the theoretical N-terminal product; however, none corresponded exactl"

However, most investigators have applied steady or pulsing flow profiles rather than oscillatory fluid flow, which occurs <i>in vivo</i> because of mechanical loading. Here oscillatory fluid flow was demonstrated to be a potentially important physical signal for loading-induced changes in bone cell metabolism. We selected three well known biological response variables including intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub>), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, and osteopontin (OPN) mRNA levels to examine the response of MC3T3–E1 osteoblastic cells to oscillatory fluid flow with shear stresses ranging from 2 to −2 Newtons/m<sup>2</sup> at 1 Hz, which is in the range expected to occur during routine physical activities. Our results showed that within 1 min, oscillatory flow induced cell Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> mobilization, whereas two MAPKs (ERK and p38) were activated over a 2-h time frame. However, there was no activation of JNK. Furthermore 2 h of oscillatory fluid flow increased steady-state OPN mRNA expression levels by approximately 4-fold, 24 h after exposure to fluid flow. The presence of both ERK and p38 inhibitors and thapsigargin completely abolished the effect of oscillatory flow on steady-state OPN mRNA levels. In addition, experiments using a variety of pharmacological agents suggest that oscillatory flow induces Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> mobilization via the L-type voltage-operated calcium channel and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pathway."

In this study we employed a dominant negative approach to determine the role of Erks in the regulation of human osteoblastic cell function. Human osteoblastic cells were transduced with a pseudotyped retrovirus encoding either a mutated Erk1 protein with a dominant negative action against both Erk1 and Erk2 (Erk1DN cells) or the LacZ protein (LacZ cells) as a control. Both basal and growth factor-stimulated MAPK activity and cell proliferation were inhibited in Erk1DN cells. Expression of Erk1DN protein suppressed both osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization by decreasing alkaline phosphatase activity and the deposition of bone matrix proteins. Cell adhesion to collagen, osteopontin, and vitronectin was decreased in Erk1DN cells as compared with LacZ cells. Cell spreading and migration on these matrices were also inhibited. In Erk1DN cells, expression of αβ1, αvβ3, and αvβ5 integrins on the surface was decreased. Metabolic labeling indicated that the synthesis of these integrins was inhibited in Erk1DN cells. These data suggest that Erks are not only essential for the growth and differentiation of osteoblasts but also are important for osteoblast adhesion, spreading, migration, and integrin expression.

These data suggest that Erks are not only essential for the growth and differentiation of osteoblasts but also are important for osteoblast adhesion, spreading, migration, and integrin expression. For bone formation to occur, osteoblast precursor cells must migrate from bone marrow compartment to bone surface where they differentiate and deposit bone matrix. Several growth factors including FGF-2,1 TGF-β, and BMP-2 not only are potent chemotactic agents for osteoblasts but also have profound effects on their growth and differentiation (1Moses H.L.

Numerous signal transduction pathways are induced by integrin-matrix interactions in a variety of cell systems (6Danen E.H. Lafrenie R.M. Miyamoto S. Yamada K.M. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Development. 1993; 117: 1183-1198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H.

Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3814) Google Scholar). The Ras/MAPK signal transduction pathway is one of the best characterized pathways. Adhesion of cells to collagen, fibronectin, or vitronectin has been shown to induce MAPK activity in many cell systems (24Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 25Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.S. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Growth factors have also been shown to activate MAPK activity (26Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 27Chaudhary L.R. Avioli L.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although both integrins and growth factors propagate their signals via MAPK, the induction of MAPK by integrin-matrix interaction is prolonged whereas growth factor-stimulated MAPK is more transient and requires integrin-mediated cell adhesion (24Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 28Aplin A.E. Short S.M. Juliano R.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Conversely, growth factors can regulate integrin expression (30Kim L.T. Yamada K.M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 214: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 31Lai C.F. Feng X. Nishimura R. Teitelbaum S.L. Avioli L.V. Ross F.P. Cheng S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36400-36406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, MAPK mediates two important signal transduction pathways, one initiated by integrins and the other by growth factors, which cross-talk to each other and further emphasize the importance of MAPK in regulating a variety of cell functions. It has been documented that MAPK activity is stimulated in osteoblasts when they adhere to type I collagen (32Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Kikuchi T. Nishida E. Fujita T. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29309-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, no data are currently available with regard to the MAPK activity when osteoblasts adhere to other bone matrix proteins. We have previously shown that MAPK is activated by growth factors in osteoblasts (27Chaudhary L.R. Avioli L.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Since integrin-matrix interaction and growth factors regulate osteoblast growth and differentiation, MAPK may play an important role in mediating these osteoblastic activities in bone formation. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the role of Erks of the MAPK superfamily in the regulation of osteoblast growth and differentiation by overexpressing a dominant negative Erk1 (Erk1DN) protein in these cells. We also examined the effects of Erk1DN protein on the expression of integrins and the migration, adhesion, and spreading properties of osteoblasts. Type I collagen (Vitrogen 100) was from Cohesion (Palo Alto, CA). Recombinant osteopontin was purified as described previously (33Cheng S.L. Lai C.-F. Fausto A. Chellaiah M. Feng S. McHugh K.

AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) and T4 polynucleotide kinase were fromPromega (Madison, WI). Recombinant protein A-Sepharose 4B was fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Polyclonal antibodies against type I collagen α chain (LF-67), osteopontin (LF-7), and bone sialoprotein (LF-6) were kindly provided by Dr. Larry W. Fisher (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Vitronectin and monoclonal antibody against human αvβ5 (P1F6) were from Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal antibodies against human αvβ3 (LM609) and human β1were purchased from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). The anti-pan-Erk antibody, which recognizes the C-terminal half of Erk1 and Erk2 molecules, was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated Erk (p-Erk) was from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal antibodies against p38, phosphorylated p38 (p-p38), and phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK), and goat anti-RSK2 antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).

Phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I (p2850) and II (p5726), protease inhibitor mixture (p8340), and anti-tubulin antibody were from Sigma. Leukostat kit was from Fisher. Human osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells were isolated from ribs as described previously (33Cheng S.L. Lai C.-F. Fausto A. Chellaiah M. Feng S. McHugh K. Teitelbaum S.L. Civitelli R.

The trabecular bone chips were recovered by bone curette and were subjected to a 2-h collagenase (1 mg/ml) digestion. After digestion, bone chips were plated into culture flasks. Osteoblasts outgrown from bone chips were subcultured. Bone marrow stromal cells, which represent relatively immature preosteoblastic cells, were also isolated from bone marrow using Histopaque-1077 gradient followed by adhesion to culture flasks. Both osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells were subcultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS). Since the results obtained with either osteoblasts or bone marrow stromal cells were similar, we defined these two cell types together as human osteoblastic (HOB) cells for convenience. A kinase-defective Erk1 cDNA (35Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Cobb (University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Erk1 K71R has been shown to function in a dominant negative fashion and can block both Erk1 and Erk2 activities (37Li Y.Q. Hii C.S. Der C.J. Ferrante A. Immunology. 1999; 96: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The Erk1 K71R cDNA was cloned into theNcoI and BamHI sites of SFG retroviral vector as described previously (38Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For generation of retroviral particles pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein, SFG-Erk1 K71R viral vector was transfected using LipofectAMINE into the 293GPG packaging cell line, which expresses the MuLV gag-pol, and also expresses the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein under tetracycline regulation (38Ory D.S.

Blood. 1997; 90: 952-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conditioned medium was harvested daily after the withdrawal of tetracycline, and the media harvested from day 3 to day 7 containing the highest titer of viral particles (≥5 × 106 colony-forming units/ml) were combined and used for transduction. Before transduction, the medium was filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane and Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide, 8 μg/ml) was added to the virus medium. As a negative control, a virus carrying the SFG-LacZ cDNA was generated in the same fashion. This pseudotyped retrovirus has been shown to have no effect on osteoblast differentiation (40Liu P. Kalajzic I. Stover M.L. Rowe D.W. Lichtler A.C. Bone. 1998; 23 (Suppl.): 616Google Scholar). The day before transduction, HOB cells were seeded in 150-mm culture dishes (1 × 106/dish). The next day, 25 ml of conditioned medium containing Erk1DN or LacZ virus was added to each dish, and the incubation continued for another 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, the virus medium was removed, and cells were grown to confluence in α-MEM with 10% HIFBS. HOB cells were seeded onto coverslips and allowed to recover overnight. Cells were then transduced with either LacZ or Erk1DN virus for 24 h, followed by further incubation in the growth medium for an additional 48 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After washing twice with PBS, cells were treated with ammonium chloride to quench any remaining paraformaldehyde. Cells were again washed with PBS and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PT), followed by incubation with anti-pan-Erk antibody (1:400) in PT containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PT, cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:200) in PT containing 1% BSA for 1 h. Finally, after extensive washing with PT, the coverslips were mounted on slides, and fluorescence was observed using an epifluorescence microscope. Confluent cells in 100-mm culture dishes were incubated in α-MEM containing 0.2% HIFBS for 24 h, followed by treatment with designated growth factor for 10 min at 37 °C. After two PBS washes, the cell layers were extracted with 0.5 ml of MAPK assay buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (0.4 ml/10 ml), and protease inhibitor mixture (0.4 ml/10 ml). Extracts were homogenized by passing through 26-gauge needles 10 times. After microcentrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. MAPK activity in the cell extract (20 μg of protein) was measured by using the MAPK assay kit with PHAS-1 protein as the substrate and [γ-32P]ATP according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Stratagene). Cell extracts (40 μg of protein), isolated as described above, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transblotted to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were dried completely and then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody (1:1000) in PBS containing 1% casein and 0.04% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. After three PBS washes, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 in PBS containing 1% casein and 0.04% Tween 20) for 30 min followed by another four PBS washes. Protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (31Lai C.F. Feng X. Nishimura R. Teitelbaum S.L. Avioli L.V. Ross F.P.

Briefly, HOB cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 0.6% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation, nuclear pellets were extracted with a high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin) for 1 h. For EMSA, radioactive synthetic double-stranded AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide, labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, was incubated with nuclear extracts (2 μg) for 20 min in binding buffer which consisted of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 20% glycerol, and 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC). The binding reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 5× TBE buffer (0.445 m Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 10 mmEDTA) containing 0.03% bromphenol blue, 0.03% xylene cyanol, and 30% glycerol. The mixtures were separated on 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gels in 0.3× TBE. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Immunocomplex kinase assay was employed to measure the phosphotransferase activity of RSK2. Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS three times and extracted with lysis buffer consisting of PBS, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmEDTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin, 50 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I (1:100). Supernatants (0.6 mg) obtained after microcentrifugation were incubated with goat anti-RSK2 antibody (1:200) together with protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight. The beads were collected by microcentrifugation, washed twice with lysis buffer, followed by kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm DTT). RSK2 phosphotransferase activity in the beads was measured by using S6 kinase assay kit and [γ-32P]ATP according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Viral-transduced HOB cells were seeded in a 24-well plate (20,000 cells/well) and allowed to recover overnight in α-MEM with 10% HIFBS. The medium was removed, and cells were incubated in 0.2% HIFBS medium for another 24 h. [3H]Thymidine (2 μCi/well) in α-MEM containing 0.2% HIFBS was added with the appropriate growth factor and the incubation continued for another 24 h. [3H]Thymidine incorporated into DNA was measured after trichloroacetic acid precipitation, ethanol washing, and alkali extraction as described previously (34Lecanda F. Avioli L.V. Cheng S.-L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Confluent viral-transduced cells in 24-well plates were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.9% NaCl), scraped into 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and sonicated in a Fisher Dismembrator (30–40% of maximum strength). Alkaline phosphatase activity in the sonicate was measured as described previously (34Lecanda F. Avioli L.V. Cheng S.-L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Mineralized matrix was detected by alizarin red-S staining for deposited calcium. Osteoblasts in six-well culture plates were incubated for 28 days in mineralization medium consisting of α-MEM, 10% HIFBS, ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) and β-glycerophosphate (10 mm). At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 1 h. After washing with water three times, the cells were incubated with 0.4% alizarin red-S in water for 10 min at room temperature, followed by five washes with water and final incubation in PBS for 15 min. Adhesion to type I collagen, osteopontin, or vitronectin was performed as described previously (33Cheng S.L. Lai C.-F. Fausto A. Chellaiah M. Feng S. McHugh K. Teitelbaum S.L. Civitelli R. Hruska K.A. Ross F.P. Avioli L.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, single cell suspensions were obtained after collagenase and trypsin/EDTA digestion. After rinsing with serum-free α-MEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA, cells were seeded to wells pre-coated with either BSA or a matrix protein (4 × 104 cells/cm2). After 1 h of incubation for adhesion measurement or 2 h for spreading assay at 37 °C, the wells were washed with PBS to remove the non-adherent cells. Adherent cells were fixed and stained with 0.5% toluidine blue in 4% paraformaldehyde. To obtain the adherent cell number, stained cells were extracted with 1% SDS, and the absorbance at 630 nm was measured. For analysis of cell spreading, cell morphology was recorded by photography using phase contrast microscope. For adhesion-induced MAPK assays, cells were adhered to matrices for 20 min and lysed in MAPK assay buffer as described above. The day before the assay, Costar transwell membranes were coated with collagen (100 ng), osteopontin (250 ng), or vitronectin (250 ng) for 3 h at room temperature. Single cell suspensions obtained as described above for the adhesion assay were delivered into the transwells (100,000 cells in 0.1 ml/transwell) suspended inside the bottom wells containing 0.6 ml of α-MEM with 0.1% BSA and 25 ng/ml FGF-2. After overnight migration in an incubator, cells on the membranes were fixed and stained using a Leukostat kit. The non-migrated cells on top of the membranes were removed with cold PBS-soaked cotton swabs, and the migrated cells on the bottom side of the membranes were counted under the microscope with the aid of a grid. A total of nine separate fields (3 × 10−4 cm2/field) were counted for each sample, and the average number of cells per field was calculated. Cells in 150-mm culture dishes were surface-labeled with [125I]NaI as described previously (33Cheng S.L. Lai C.-F. Fausto A. Chellaiah M. Feng S. McHugh K. Teitelbaum S.L. Civitelli R. Hruska K.A. Ross F.P. Avioli L.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After labeling, cells were extracted with cell lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 2% Renex 30, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). Aliquots (∼400 μl) of equal trichloroacetic acid- precipitable radioactivity were incubated overnight with monoclonal antibodies against β1, αvβ3, or αvβ5 and protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C on a Nutator. Pellets obtained after microcentrifugation were washed twice with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, followed by PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 0.02% NaN3 in addition to 1 mg/ml ovalbumin, and finally with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 0.02% NaN3. Immunoprecipitated integrins in the beads were extracted with sample buffer and applied to SDS-PAGE. Integrin bands were visualized by autoradiography. For measurement of integrin biosynthesis, cells were incubated in methionine- and cystine- deficient medium containing 5% dialyzed HIFBS and 25 μCi/ml Tran35S-Label for 24 h. After lysis,35S-labeled integrins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE as described above. Protein concentration was measured by using the Bio-Rad protein DC assay kit. To quantify the band intensity, x-ray films were subjected to image analysis using ISS SepraScan 2001 (Integrated Separation Systems, Natick, MA). Statistical analyses were performed using Student's unpaired t test. Each experiment was performed at least twice and the representative data were presented as mean ± S.E. HOB cells have been shown to adhere to numerous bone matrix proteins, including type I collagen, osteopontin, vitronectin, fibronectin, and bone sialoprotein, in an integrin-dependent fashion (12Grzesik W.J.

It has been well established in various cell systems that Erk/MAPK activity is stimulated by cell adhesion to matrix (6Danen E.H. Lafrenie R.M. Miyamoto S. Yamada K.M. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

When HOB cells adhered to type I collagen, fibronectin, osteopontin, or vitronectin, both Erk-2 (major band at 42 kDa, the main Erk expressed in normal human osteoblasts (Ref. 27Chaudhary L.R. Avioli L.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)) and Erk-1 (minor band at 44 kDa) activities were consistently enhanced (4.9–7.4-fold after normalization with the corresponding tubulin protein level) as determined by Western blot analysis using antibody against the active phosphorylated Erks (p-Erk) (Fig. 1). Likewise, the total MAPK enzymatic activity, determined by the incorporation of 32P into PHAS-1 substrate, was stimulated 4–6-fold upon HOB cell adhesion to these matrix proteins (Fig. 1). Since Erks mediate both growth factor- and integrin- induced signal transduction, it is likely that they play important role in the regulation of osteoblast function. We employed the dominant negative Erk1 K71R (Erk1DN) protein, which can inhibit both Erk1 and Erk2 activities (37Li Y.Q. Hii C.S. Der C.J. Ferrante A. Immunology. 1999; 96: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), to analyze the role of Erks in osteoblast function. Using a pseudotyped retrovirus as a carrier for Erk1DN cDNA, 70–80% of transduced HOB cells expressed high level of Erk1 mutant protein as compared with cells transduced with virus encoding the LacZ protein (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis using anti-pan-Erk antibody confirmed the overexpression of Erk1 K71R in Erk1DN cells (Fig.3, top panel,top band at 44 kDa). Interestingly, the total amount of Erk2 was decreased to 68% of LacZ level in Erk1DN cells (Fig. 3, top panel, bottom band at 42 kDa). Analysis of individual Erk activity by Western blotting for p-Erk protein levels indicated that the concentration of active p-Erk2 was further decreased to 30% of LacZ level in Erk1DN cells (Fig. 3, second panel,bottom band). Consistent with earlier reports (35Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Since p38 and JNK are also members of the MAPK superfamily, we analyzed the activity of these two kinases by Western blotting using antibodies that recognize the activated forms of th"

However, the mechanisms of how SPP activates these proangiogenic pathways are poorly understood. Here we show that SPP signals through the EDG-1 receptor to the heterotrimeric G protein Gi, leading to activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt and phosphorylation of the Akt substrate, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). Inhibition of Gisignaling, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity resulted in a decrease in SPP-induced endothelial cell chemotaxis. SPP also stimulates eNOS phosphorylation and NO release and these effects are also attenuated by inhibition of Gi signaling, PI 3-kinase, and Akt. However, inhibition of NO production did not influence SPP-induced chemotaxis but effectively blocked the chemotactic actions of vascular endothelial growth factor. Thus, SPP signals through Gi and PI 3-kinase leading to Akt activation and eNOS phosphorylation.

Five members of the endothelial differentiation gene family (EDG) of G protein-coupled receptors (EDG-1, EDG-3, EDG-5, EDG-6, and EDG-8) have been identified as SPP receptors in a wide variety of cell types (2Hla T.

These receptors exhibit high affinity binding for SPP, and SPP is weakly displaced by other sphingolipids, including lysophosphatidic acid. EDG receptors differ in their association with the G protein family members. Both EDG-3 and EDG-5 potently activate Gi, Gq, G12, and G13, whereas EDG-1 and EDG-8 couples to Gi but not Gq. In a similar manner, EDG-6 couples to Gi whereas a role for Gq,G12, and G13 has yet to be addressed (6Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar).

However, the downstream effectors of Gi responsible for these effects are not well established. It has been shown that SPP signaling via EDG-1 stimulates mitogen-activated kinase family member ERK (ERK1/ERK2), an effect inhibited by two structurally distinct phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitors (LY294002 and wortmannin). Moreover, immunoprecipitation of Grb-2 from SPP treated cells resulted in the recovery of PI 3-kinase activity, an effect blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (14Rakhit S. Conway A.M. Tate R.

PI 3-kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol lipids at the d-3 position producing phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. One downstream effector of PI (3MacLennan A.J. Browe C.S. Gaskin A.A. Lado D.C. Shaw G. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). Upon receptor activation, Akt is recruited to the plasma membrane and binds to inositol lipids via its pleckstrin homology domain. Akt is then phosphorylated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinases, and this phosphorylation enhances its catalytic activity toward a variety of diverse substrates (16Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others (17Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A.

Therefore, in this study we assessed whether the PI 3-kinase/Akt/eNOS pathway is activated upon SPP stimulation in endothelial cells, thus contributing to the angiogenic properties of this bioactive lipid. Bovine lung microvascular endothelial cells (BLMVECs, Vec Technologies) were cultured as described previously (30Sessa W.C. Garcia-Cardena G. Liu J. Keh A. Pollock J.S. Bradley J. Thiru S.

Briefly, exponentially growing cells were harvested with trypsin (0.05%, v/v) and EDTA (0.53 mm), counted, and resuspended at a density of 0.4 × 106 in chemotaxis medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) before being placed in the upper well of a 48-well chemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe). The lower wells of the chemotaxis chamber contained chemotaxis medium without (controls) or with VEGF (10 ng/ml) or SPP (10–500 nm). Upper and lower wells were separated by a polyvinilpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filter with 8-μm pores (Poretics Corp., Livermore, CA) coated with 100 μg/ml type I collagen (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). The chamber was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were fixed with ethanol (70%) and nonmigrating cells on the upper surface of the filter removed. Migrated cells were stained with Giemsa and counted (magnification, ×400) in three random fields per well. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and migration was expressed as the number of total cells counted per well. In some experiments, BLMVECs were pre-incubated with or without l-NAME (2 mm) or LY294002 (10 μm) for 30 min or 1 h, respectively, or with or without PTx (200 ng/ml) for 6 h at 37 °C.

For measurement of NO, we analyzed the release of NO2−, the stable breakdown product of NO, from BLMVECs treated with or without SPP (10–500 nm), LY294002 (10 μm),l-N-mono-methyl-arginine (l-NMMA) (1 mm), or PTx (200 ng/ml). Cells, plated on 60-mm2 dishes were equilibrated for 30 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum. To stimulate NO release, test reagents were added for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected for analysis of NO by chemiluminescence. Samples (10 μl) containing NO2− were refluxed in glacial acetic acid containing sodium iodide. Under these conditions, NO2− was quantitatively reduced to NO, which was quantified by a chemiluminescence detector after reaction with ozone in a NO analyzer (Sievers). Net NO2− per μg of protein was calculated after subtracting background levels of NO2−found in the media. In experiments confirming the involvement of Gi protein or PI 3-kinase, we pre-incubated the cells with LY294002 (10 μm for 1 h) or PTx (200 ng/ml for 6 h) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum. In some experiments, BLMVECs were infected with an adenovirus that expresses dominant negative Akt, which was hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged, and contained mutations at K179A, T308A, and S473A (AAA-Akt) or a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing virus. Endothelial cells were infected with adenovirus (multiplicity of infection of 25) containing GFP or AAA-Akt for 4 h. The virus was removed, and cells were left to recover for 12 h in complete medium. These conditions resulted in uniform expression of the transgenes in close to 100% of the cells (determined by GFP expression in living cells). BLMVECs treated with or without SPP (500 nm), PTx (200 ng/ml), or LY294002 (10 μm) were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and total cell lysates were prepared by scraping the cells in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm NaPP, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm Pefabloc, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were rotated for 1 h at 4 °C and the insoluble material removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of the denatured proteins were separated on a 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (Mini Protean II, Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked by incubation in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (v/v) non-fat dry milk for 2 h, followed by a 2-h incubation, at room temperature, with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt-Ser473or anti-Akt antibodies (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) or with rabbit polyclonal anti-Phospho-eNOS-Ser1177 (New England Biolabs) or mouse monoclonal anti-eNOS (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), The filters were washed extensively in Tris-buffered saline, containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween, before incubation for 1 h with goat anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Membranes were then washed and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Twenty micrograms of BLMVEC total RNA and 280 pg of the EDG-1, EDG-3, EDG-5, and EDG-8 in vitrotranscripts were loaded, and Northern analysis was conducted as described previously (2Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that endothelial cells express high levels of EDG-1 transcript (2Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we first examined whether other SPP receptors are expressed in BLMVECs. Consistent with previous studies, Northern blot analysis clearly demonstrated abundant expression of EDG-1 mRNA. BLMVECs also expressed a lower level EDG-5 transcript and barely detectable EDG-3 mRNA. However, the EDG-8 mRNA was undetectable in BLMVECs (Fig. 1). In vitrotranscripts for EDG-1, -3, -5, and -8 were also loaded as positive controls. Since activation of the EDG-1 receptor is important for angiogenesis, we first investigated the involvement of EDG-1 in SPP-induced chemotaxis in endothelial cells by employing a modified Boyden chamber assay. BLMVECs were subjected to a migration assay in the absence or presence of SPP (10–500 nm) as a chemoattractant. As shown in Fig. 2, SPP dose-dependently increased endothelial cell migration and the migratory activity at 500 nm was about 5–6 times that of the control. SPP induced greater cell migration than typically seen with VEGF as a chemoattractant (see Fig. 6). To investigate the possibility that a Gi-coupled receptor may be involved in chemotaxis induced by SPP, BLMVECs were treated with pertussis toxin (200 ng/ml) for 6 h prior to addition of SPP. Pertussis toxin pretreatment, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Giproteins, completely abolished SPP-induced chemotaxis (Fig. 2), suggesting that SPP binding to EDG-1 increases chemotaxis in a Gi-dependent manner.Figure 6NO is not involved in SPP-stimulated chemotaxis of BLMVECs. A, BLMVECs were pretreated without or with PTx (200 ng/ml) for 6 h or l-NAME (2 mm) for 30 min, trypsinized, and resuspended in chemotaxis medium. Then, a migration experiment was performed as above. Data points represent the mean number of migrating cells/field (± S.D.) calculated in three different wells. Representative results from two separate experiments are shown.

Representative results from two separate experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been shown that the SPP binding to EDG-1 triggers activation of ERK1/ERK2, an effect inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors (14Rakhit S. Conway A.M. Tate R. Bower T. Pyne N.J. Pyne S. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recent work from us and others has shown that inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, as well as dominant-negative suppression of Akt activity, attenuate growth factor-induced migration (24Morales-Ruiz M. Fulton D. Sowa G. Languino L.R. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 33Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). To directly test the role of PI 3-kinase in SPP-induced cell migration, we first examined if SPP can activate Akt phosphorylation. As seen in Fig.3 A, SPP stimulated Akt phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner with maximal activation occurring within 5 min and sustained phosphorylation lasting for up to 15 min. SPP-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473 was antagonized by preincubation of BLMVECs with LY294002 and PTx. Next, we examined the effects of the LY294002 on basal and SPP-stimulated cell migration in endothelial cells. As shown previously, SPP stimulated cell migration (lane 4) and this effect was completely inhibited by PTx pretreatment (lane 6) whereas PTx did not influence basal migration (lane 3). Furthermore, SPP-stimulated cell migration was blocked by ∼50% by LY294002 (from 90.9 ± 4.9 to 43.9 ± 7.0 migrated cells/field for cells treated with SPP and cells treated with SPP and LY294002, respectively) (lane 5), although basal migration (without stimulation) was not affected by this drug (lane 2). Collectively, these data indicate that SPP signals via Gi to PI 3-kinase and Akt and the PI 3-kinase pathway is in part responsible for endothelial cell migration initiated by this bioactive lipid. Recently, we have shown that Akt can phosphorylate bovine eNOS on serine 1179, resulting in eNOS activation and NO production (17Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). To examine whether SPP-induced Akt activation is coupled to NO production, we examined the effects of SPP on eNOS phosphorylation and NO release. SPP increased NO production in a dose-dependent manner in BLMVECs (Fig. 4 A), an effect blocked by the NOS inhibitor, l-NMMA (data not shown). Maximal SPP-induced NO release was abrogated by PTx (lane 5), whereas PTx did not influence basal NO synthesis (lane 6). As previously reported for VEGF-stimulated NO production, LY294002 attenuated SPP-induced NO release (from 1.0 ± 0.1 to 0.4 ± 0.1 pmol/μg of protein for cells treated with SPP and cells treated with SPP and LY294002, respectively). Next, we documented the phosphorylation state of eNOS by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4 B). As predicted, SPP rapidly stimulated eNOS phosphorylation on serine 1179 (upper panel) without changing total eNOS levels (bottom panel). Maximal phosphorylation was seen at 5 min, which decreased over 20 min to levels slightly above basal values. SPP-stimulated phosphorylation of eNOS was antagonized by preincubation of BLMVECs with PTx and LY294002. These findings correlate well with the results in Figs. 3 A and 4 A, respectively. Finally, to more firmly establish a link between SPP signaling to Akt, we infected endothelial cells with adenoviruses expressing either a dominant negative form of Akt (AAA-Akt) or GFP and assessed NO release and eNOS phosphorylation. As seen in Fig.5 A, SPP-induced NO release was abrogated by expression of AAA-Akt. In addition, SPP-induced phosphorylation of eNOS was markedly suppressed (Fig. 5 B). Collectively, our results indicate that SPP binding to EDG-1 signals through Gi, leading to PI 3-kinase-dependent Akt stimulation, eNOS phosphorylation, and NO production. As a downstream signal of PI 3-kinase/Akt, we examined the involvement of NO in SPP-induced chemotaxis in BLMEC because VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell migration can be blocked byl-arginine-substituted analogues that inhibit NOS. Notably, the NOS inhibitor l-NAME (2 mm) had no effect on the chemotaxis produced by SPP (Fig.6 A), even though the same concentration of l-NAME blocked VEGF-induced cell migration (Fig. 6 B), as shown previously (24Morales-Ruiz M. Fulton D. Sowa G. Languino L.R. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Therefore, SPP activates chemotaxis without requiring activation of eNOS. The central findings of this study are that SPP activates Akt, eNOS phosphorylation, and NO production through the PTx sensitive G protein Gi. In addition, we show that PI 3-kinase is a downstream effector of Gi that participates in the chemoattractant actions of SPP in endothelial cells; however, SPP-stimulated NO production does not influence the tractional forces leading to cell migration. Since vasodilation and increases in endothelial cell permeability also accompany an angiogenic response, it is possible that SPP activation of Gi-dependent PI 3-kinase/Akt/eNOS leading to NO production may regulate local blood flow and permeability during angiogenesis. SPP has been implicated in both inhibition and stimulation of chemotactic responses. SPP inhibits B16/F10 melanoma cell motility through a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway (34Yamamura S. Yatomi Y. Ruan F. Sweeney E.A. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10751-10759Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and inhibits chemoinvasiveness and motility of breast cancer cell lines (35Wang F. Nohara K. Olivera A. Thompson E.W. Spiegel S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, SPP induces endothelial cell chemotaxis, and this effect is blocked by PTx (9Lee O.H. Kim Y.M.

Similarly, SPP also stimulates the migration of HEK 293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing EDG-1 or EDG-3 in a PTx-sensitive manner. However, EDG-5 transfection into Chinese hamster ovary cells does not correlate with induction of cell migration (11Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Hobson J.P. Movafagh S. Zukowska-Grojec Z. Milstien S.

Our results are consistent with these latter studies showing that SPP-induced chemotaxis in endothelial cells is blocked by PTx, suggesting an important role for Gi-protein coupled SPP receptors to cell migration. Furthermore, the EDG-1 mRNA is the most prominently expressed SPP receptor in BLMVECs in contrast to the lower levels of EDG-5 mRNA and the barely detectable EDG-3 mRNA. Together, these data suggest that the activation of Gi coupled to the EDG-1 receptor is necessary for SPP-induced chemotaxis in BLMVECs. Directional cell motility is driven by chemoattractants that bind to G protein coupled receptors receptors (interleukin-8 and fMLP) or growth factors that signal through receptor tyrosine kinases (VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor). In both cases, many studies have shown that PI 3-kinase is an important mediator of these chemotactic responses. Recently, three different groups have shown that neutrophils or peritoneal macrophages deficient in p110γ, a catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, show a reduction in movement toward chemoattractants such as fMLP (38Li Z. Jiang H. Xie W. Zhang Z. Smrcka A.V. Wu D. Science. 2000; 287: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 39Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Jones R.G. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Stanford W.L.

Indeed, we and others have shown that inhibition of PI 3-kinase or its downstream target Akt blocked VEGF-stimulated migration in endothelial cells (24Morales-Ruiz M. Fulton D. Sowa G. Languino L.R. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar,26Dimmeler S. Dernbach E. Zeiher A.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and constitutively active Akt is sufficient to stimulate chemokinesis. A recent study in prostate cancer cells has demonstrated that αvβ3integrin/ matrix-dependent cell migration was also linked to the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway (41Zheng D.Q. Woodard A.S. Tallini G. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24565-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Accordingly, here we show that binding of SPP to the Gi-coupled receptor, presumably EDG-1, activates the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Importantly, we also demonstrate that inhibition of PI 3-kinase attenuates SPP-induced chemotaxis in BLMVECs, in agreement with studies that established a crucial role of the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway in chemotaxis. The precise mechanism of how activation of Akt leads to chemotaxis is not known but is likely though direct modulation of actin polymerization/depolymerization pathways. It has recently been demonstrated that overexpression of EDG-1 receptor and eNOS in COS-7 cells led to SPP-dependent eNOS activation (42Igarashi J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32363-32370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism was not explored. We and others (17Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J.

Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) have shown that VEGF, fluid shear stress, estrogen, or IGF-1 can stimulate Akt and subsequent eNOS phosphorylation on serine 1179, resulting in eNOS activation and NO production. Moreover, substitution of serine 1179 with aspartate leads to constitutive activation of eNOS and NO production due to enhanced electron flux from the reductase domain to the oxygenase domain (45McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In agreement with these studies, here we show that SPP induces eNOS phosphorylation on serine 1179 and NO production in endothelial cells. SPP-induced eNOS phosphorylation and NO release were inhibited by PTx, LY294002, and dominant negative Akt, suggesting that SPP binding to EDG-1 signals via Gi to PI 3-kinase/Akt leading to eNOS phosphorylation and NO production. It should be noted that the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 was not able to completely block SPP-stimulated NO production at a concentration that abrogates Akt activation, suggesting other pathways of eNOS activation exist. Furthermore, similar results were obtained with dominant negative Akt. Indeed, SPP increases cytoplasmic calcium in endothelial cells via a PTx-sensitive mechanism (12Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell. 1999; 99: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar), thus providing calcium to activate calmodulin and the binding of calmodulin to eNOS leading to an increase in eNOS activity (46Forstermann U. Gorsky L.D. Pollock J.S. Ishii K. Schmidt H.H. Heller M. Murad F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 7-13PubMed Google Scholar). The present study also shows that production of NO is not required for endothelial cell migration mediated by SPP. In contrast, previous reports have pointed to an important role of NO in VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration (24Morales-Ruiz M. Fulton D. Sowa G. Languino L.R. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 25Radisavljevic Z. Avraham H. Avraham S. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1998; 274: C236-C244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These apparently contradictory observations most likely reflect the diversity of mechanisms activated in endothelial cells in response to different chemoattractants. However, it is feasible that the increase in NO production mediated by SPP may be involved in other angiogenic functions promoted by this bioactive lipid, including cell survival through inactivation of caspase-3 (23Rossig L. Fichtlscherer B. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Mulsch A. Dimmeler S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6823-6826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and enhancement of blood flow and permeability. Thus, our findings define two additional proangiogenic actions of SPP: activation of Akt and NO release. Further elucidation of the precise roles of Akt and NO in the context of angiogenesis will increase our understanding of the important role of SPP during vascular development, angiogenesis, and vessel homeostasis.

Whereas many of these mutations affect well characterized channels of the nervous system, little is known about the situation in non-excitable cells. One new superfamily of channels of widespread expression and function include channels of the Trp family.

Two other identified members of this family of Trp-related proteins, p120 and melastatin, have not yet been demonstrated to function as ion channels. One of these genes, p120 (11Jaquemar D.

So far, little is known of the Ca2+ entry pathways in these tissues. The Ca2+-permeation properties of the CaT-L channel, shown here, renders CaT-L as a good candidate for secretion coupling in these tissues. Most interesting, the CaT-L transcripts are undetectable in benign prostate tissue but are present at high levels in locally advanced prostate cancer, metastatic lesions, and recurrent androgen-insensitive prostatic adenocarcinoma. Hence, molecular classification of prostate cancer subclasses and class prediction by monitoring the level of human CaT-L gene expression is feasible. In addition, functional characterization of the new Ca2+ channel suggests a possible link between Ca2+ signaling and prostate cancer progression. Total RNA was isolated from human placenta as described (14Wissenbach U. Schroth G. Philipp S. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and poly(A)+ RNA was obtained using poly(A)+ RNA spin columns (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To obtain an oligo-(dT)-primed cDNA library, placenta poly(A)+ RNA was reverse-transcribed using the cDNA choice system (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the resulting cDNA was subcloned in λ-Zap phages (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After screening the library with the human expressed sequence tag 1404042 (GenBankTM), several cDNA clones were identified, isolated, and sequenced. Additional cDNA clones were isolated from two specifically primed cDNA libraries from a second placenta using primers corresponding to amino acids676HLSLPM and 271GPLTSTL of the CaT-L sequence (Fig. 1 a) and the 345-bp NcoI/BamHI and 596-bp EcoRI/SstI cDNA fragments of CaT-L as probes. Thirteen independent cDNA clones were sequenced on both strands. In addition the complete coding region of the CaT-L protein was amplified by PCR, using human cDNA isolated from placenta as template, and eight independent cDNA clones were sequenced on both strands. The nucleotide sequences of CaT-La and CaT-Lb have been deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM under the accession numbers AJ243500 and AJ243501, respectively. For Northern blot analysis 5 μg of human poly(A)+ RNA from human placenta and from prostate (obtained from patients undergoing transurethral prostatectomy because of benign prostatic hyperplasia) were separated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels and thereafter transferred to Hybond N nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (14Wissenbach U. Schroth G. Philipp S. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The membranes were hybridized in the presence of 50% formamide at 42 °C overnight. Alternatively, a human multiple tissue RNA blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized under the same conditions. The probe was a 345-bp EcoRI/BamHI fragment spanning the protein coding region of amino acid residues 528–643 of the CaT-L protein (Fig. 1 a), labeled by random priming with [α,32P]dCTP. Filters were exposed to x-ray films for 4 days. To obtain the recombinant dicistronic expression plasmid pdiCaT-L carrying the entire protein-coding regions of CaT-Lb and the GFP (15Prasher D.C. Eckenrode V.K. Ward W.W. Prendergast F.G. Cormier M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar), the 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences of the CaT-Lb cDNA were removed, and the consensus sequence for initiation of translation in vertebrates (16Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar) was introduced immediately 5′ of the translation initiation codon; and the resulting cDNA was subcloned into the pCAGGS vector (17Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar), downstream of the chicken β-actin promoter. The internal ribosomal entry site derived from encephalomyocarditis virus (18Kim D.G. Kang H.M. Jang S.K. Shin H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3636-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), followed by the GFP cDNA containing a Ser-65 → Thr mutation (19Heim R. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1995; 373: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar), was then cloned 3′ to the CaT-Lb cDNA. The internal ribosomal entry site sequence allows the simultaneous translation of CaT-Lb and GFP from one transcript. Thus, transfected cells can be detected unequivocally by the development of green fluorescence. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) were transfected with pdiCaT-L using lipofectamine (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as described (20Philipp S. Cavalié A. Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Zimmer S. Trost C. Marquart A. Murakami M. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6166-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). For measuring [Ca2+]i, HEK cells were cotransfected with the pcDNA3-CaT-Lb and pcDNA3-GFP (21Philipp S. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Putney J.W.J. Calcium Signaling. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2000: 321-342Google Scholar) in a ratio of 4:1. To obtain pcDNA3-CaT-Lb the entire protein coding region of CaT-Lb including the consensus sequence for initiation of translation in vertebrates (16Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands). Measurements of [Ca2+]i and patch clamp experiments were carried out 2 days and 1 day after transfection, respectively. The chromosomal localization of the human CaT-L gene was performed using NIGMS somatic hybrid mapping panel 2 (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ) described previously (22Drwinga H.L. Toji L.H. Kim C.H. Greene A.E. Mulivor R.A. Genomics. 1993; 16: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23Dubois B.L. Naylor S.L. Genomics. 1993; 16: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and primers corresponding to amino acids115YEGQTA and 158NLIYFG of the CaT-L sequence (Fig. 3 a). Patch clamp recordings on single transfected cells were performed at 22–25 °C in the tight seal whole-cell configuration using fire-polished patch pipettes (3–10 MΩ uncompensated series resistance) 2 days after transfection. Pipette and cell capacitance were electronically canceled before each voltage ramp. Membrane currents were filtered at 1.5 kHz and digitized at a sampling rate of 5–10 kHz. To analyze transfected cells, currents were recorded with an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier controlled by Pulse 8.3 software (HEKA Electronics). The pipette solution contained (in mm) the following: 140 aspartic acid, 10 EGTA, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes (pH 7.2 with CsOH). The bath solution contained (in mm) the following: 110 NaCl, 10 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 50 mannitol, 10 glucose, 20 Hepes (pH 7, 4 with CsOH) and 2 CaCl2, or no added CaCl2(−Ca2+ solution). Divalent free bath solution contained (in mm) the following: 116 NaCl, 10 CsCl, 50 mannitol, 10 glucose, 20 Hepes, 1 EGTA (pH 7, 4 with CsOH) and bath solution without Na+ contained 110N-methyl-d-glucamine instead of NaCl. Whole-cell currents were recorded every second by applying 200-ms voltage clamp ramps from −100 to +100 mV from a holding potential of either −40 or +70 mV. The holding potential of +70 mV, which reduces Ca2+influx, in combination with high internal EGTA was used to minimize Ca2+ dependent feedback mechanisms. Data are given as mean ± S.E. Values were not corrected for liquid junction potentials. Measured currents were normalized to cell capacitance,i.e. −25.3 ± 0.4 pA/pF for CaT-L-transfected cells (n = 12) and −1.56 ± 0.54 pA/pF for GFP controls (n = 6) at −80-mV ramp potential in normal bath solution. Measurements of [Ca2+]i in single HEK cells were performed with a digital imaging system (T.I.L.L. Photonics). Cells grown on coverslips were loaded with 4 μm fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 60 min at 37 °C in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were washed three times with 300 μl of buffer containing 115 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Nominal Ca2+-free solutions contained ∼2 μm Ca2+. [Ca2+]i was calculated from the fluorescence ratios obtained at 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths as described (24Garcia D.E. Cavalié A. Lux H.D. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 545-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated three times. Sense and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to the amino acid residues11LILCLWSK, 637QDLNRQRI, and651FHTRGSED of the CaT-L sequence (Fig. 1 a) were synthesized. Using the BLAST sequence similarity search tool provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD), the antisense sequences show maximal similarity of <71% to sequences in the GenBankTM data base. The oligodeoxynucleotides used for hybridization were biotinylated at the 3′ end. The non-radioactive in situ hybridization method was carried out as described (25Bonkhoff H. Fixemer T. Hunsicker I. Remberger K. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 641-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) using formalin-fixed slices of 6–8 μm thickness. Briefly, the slices were deparaffinized, rehydrated in graded alcohols, and incubated in the presence of PBS buffer including 10 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 0.5 h. After prehybridization, the slices were hybridized at 37 °C using the biotinylated deoxyoligonucleotides (0.5 pmol/μl) in the presence of 33% formamide for 12 h. Thereafter, the slices were rinsed several times with 2× SSC and incubated at 25 °C for 0.5 h with avidin/biotinylated tyramide peroxidase complex (ABC, Dako). After several washes with PBS buffer, the slices were incubated in the presence of biotinylated tyramide and peroxide (0.15% w/v) for 10 min, rinsed with PBS buffer, and additionally incubated with ABC for 0.5 h. The slices were then washed with PBS buffer and incubated in the presence of DAB solution (diaminobenzidine (50 μg/ml), 50 mm Tris/EDTA buffer, pH 8.4, 0.15% H2O2 in N,N-dimethylformamide, Merck). The reaction was stopped after 4 min by incubating the slides in water. Biotinylated tyramide was obtained by incubating NHS-LC biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-6-[biotinimid]-hexanoate, 2.5 mg/ml, Pierce) and tyramine-HCl (0.75 mg/ml, Sigma) in 25 mmborate buffer (pH 8.5) for 12 h. The tyramide solution was diluted 1000-fold (v/v) in PBS buffer before use. Normal human tissue included placenta (n = 2), prostate tissue (n = 2), colon (n = 2), stomach (n = 2), lung (n = 2), kidney (n = 2), endometrium (n = 2), salivary glands (n = 2), pancreas (n = 2), and parathyroid glands (n = 2). Transurethral resections with benign prostatic hyperplasia were obtained from three patients without clinical and pathological evidence of malignancy. Prostate cancer tissue from five radical prostatectomy specimens was submitted for study. The pathological stages and grades included pT3b (n = 2), pT3a (n = 2), pT2b (n = 1), and primary Gleason grades 5 (n = 2), 4 (n = 2), and 3 (n = 2). Four foci of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia were identified in the radical prostatectomy specimens. Lymph node metastases were obtained from five staging lymphadenectomies without subsequent prostatectomy. The material further contained palliative transurethral resection specimens from five patients with recurrent androgen-insensitive adenocarcinomas after orchiectomy. All specimens were available as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Sequences were analyzed using the Heidelberg Unix Sequence Analysis Resources of the biocomputing unit at the German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg. The phylogenetic distances of proteins were calculated with the Clustal/Clustree program (26Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar, 27Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55635) Google Scholar), and the similarity of protein sequences in pairs was calculated with the ClustalW algorithm (28Needleman S.B. Wunsch C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (7761) Google Scholar). Photographs were scanned and processed using Corel Photo-Paint/Corel Draw and Adobe PhotoShop. In search of proteins distantly related to the Trp family of ion channels, a human expressed sequence tag (EST 1404042) was identified in the GenBankTMdata base using BLAST programs (29Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70338) Google Scholar). This EST was used as a probe to screen oligo(dT) and additional specifically primed human placenta cDNA libraries. Several positive cDNA clones were isolated, sequenced, and found to contain the complete sequence of the EST 1404042 clone as well as additional 5′-sequences. These clones cover an mRNA of about 2.9 kb with an open reading frame of 2175 bases (Fig.1 a) encoding a protein of 725 amino acid residues that we tentatively called human Ca2+transport protein-like (CaT-L). Downstream of the CaT-L coding sequence an additional open reading frame has been postulated (GenBankTM accession numberX83877) 2N. Tomilin and V., Boyko, unpublished results. to represent a zinc finger type DNA-binding protein. The functional significance of this putative gene product is not known. Hydropathy analysis reveals a hydrophobic core in the CaT-L protein with six peaks likely to represent membrane-spanning helices (S1 to S6) and a putative pore region between S5 and S6 (Fig. 1 b). The hydrophobic core is flanked by long presumptive cytoplasmic domains at the N and C termini (Fig. 1 c). A similar topology has been proposed for the light-activated ion channels in theDrosophila compound eye, Trp and TrpL, and related nematode and mammalian gene products (21Philipp S. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Putney J.W.J. Calcium Signaling. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2000: 321-342Google Scholar, 30Harteneck C. Plant T.D. Schultz G. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 4: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of the CaT-L protein (Fig. 1 c) contains six amino acid sequence motives (amino acid residues 45–69, 79–102, 116–140, 162–186, 195–219, and 239–263) related to the consensus sequence of ankyrin-like repeats (31Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, a and d, amino acid sequence comparison places human CaT-L in close relationship to the rat intestine Ca2+ transport protein (CaT1 (10Peng J.B. Chen X.Z. Berger U.V. Vassilev P.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22739-22746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar)) and the human renal epithelial Ca2+ channel (ECaC (9Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.

Meij I.C. van den Heuvel L.P. Knoers N.V. den Hollander A.I. Eggert P. Garcia-Nieto V. Claverie-Martin F. Bindels R.J. Genomics. 2000; 67: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)), sharing 90 (rat CaT1) and 77% (human ECaC) overall amino acid sequence identity. More distantly related members of this gene family include non-selective cation channels such as the rat vanilloid receptors Vr1 and VRL that share common amino acid sequence motives (21Philipp S. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Putney J.W.J. Calcium Signaling. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2000: 321-342Google Scholar), although overall sequence identity is low (Vr1, 28%; VRL, 27%). To investigate CaT-L expression, Northern analysis was performed using poly(A)+ RNA from different human tissues and a 345-bpEcoRI/BamHI fragment of CaT-L cDNA as a probe (Fig. 2 a). We found that CaT-L transcripts of 3.0 kb are expressed in placenta, pancreas, and prostate. The size of these transcripts corresponds to the size of the cloned CaT-L cDNA (2902 bp). In addition, a shorter transcript of 1.8 kb is detectable in poly(A)+ RNA isolated from human testis, which may result from alternative mRNA processing in this tissue. No CaT-L transcripts were detected in heart, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, spleen, ovary, and leukocytes. Interestingly, no CaT-L transcripts could be detected in small intestine, where both CaT1 and ECaC transcripts have been detected, nor in colon and brain (CaT1) or in kidney (ECaC) where these transcripts are predominantly expressed. The lack of CaT-L expression in human kidney and intestine suggests that CaT-L does not serve the physiological functions in these tissues that have been associated with the ECaC and CaT1 proteins and that include intestinal and renal Ca2+ absorption. Therefore, CaT-L is unlikely to represent the human ortholog of rat CaT1. A human cDNA sequence of 446 bp has been deposited to the GenBankTM data base (accession number AJ277909) that is identical to the corresponding sequence reported here. This sequence has been postulated to represent part of human CaT1, but no data are available that support this suggestion. Interestingly a 115-bp fragment, tentatively called CaT-Like2 (CaT-L2), was amplified from human genomic DNA and sequenced. It encodes an amino acid sequence (Fig. 1 a) that shares 92% sequence identity with human CaT-L, 95% with human ECaC, and 81% with rat CaT1 sequences and may represent a part of an additional ECaC/CaT1-related channel. To characterize further the cell-specific expression of CaT-L transcripts, in situ hybridization experiments were performed, using various human tissue sections (Fig. 2,b–i) obtained from placenta (taken from a 10-week-old abort), pancreas (removed from patients with pancreatic cancer), salivary gland, colon, and kidney. In the placenta (Fig. 2 b) CaT-L transcripts are expressed in trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. In the pancreas (Fig. 2 c) CaT-L transcripts are restricted to acinar cells and are not detectable in ductal epithelial cells and Langerhans islets. No CaT-L expression was found in regions of pancreatic carcinomas (data not shown). In salivary glands, CaT-L expression occurs in subsets of myoepithelial cells (Fig.2 d). Corresponding to the results obtained by Northern blot analysis, no CaT-L transcripts could be detected in tissue sections of human colon (Fig. 2 h) and human kidney (Fig. 2 i). In addition no transcripts could be detected in stomach, endometrium, lung, and parathyroid gland (data not shown). Comparison of the DNA sequences of the various CaT-L cDNA clones obtained from a human placenta revealed that the sequences could be grouped into two classes, which differ in five nucleotide substitutions (Fig.3 a). Three of the five substitutions resulted in changes of the encoded amino acid residues, whereas two nucleotide substitutions were silent (a1080g andg1878a). The resulting two protein sequences that differ in three amino acid residues (R157C, V378M, and T681M) were called CaT-La and CaT-Lb (Figs. 1 a and 3 a). This finding was reproduced by isolating CaT-L a and b cDNA clones from a second placenta. In addition, PCR amplification of the full-length CaT-L cDNA from a third placenta yielded only the b variant when eight amplified full-length CaT-L cDNAs were subcloned and sequenced. The nucleotide substitutions may reflect a coupled polymorphism; alternatively, the underlying mRNAs of the two cDNA classes may be products of different gene loci or may arise by RNA editing. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first designed a primer pair common to both CaT-L a and b isoforms that flanked the silent substitution a1080g and the substitution that leads to the amino acid exchange V378M. We then PCR-amplified a DNA fragment of 458 bp from genomic DNA isolated from human T-lymphocytes. Both classes of DNAs were amplified, and both amplification products contained a common intron sequence of 303 bp (Fig. 3 b). The a1080gsubstitution in the CaT-Lb DNA generates a new recognition site for the restriction enzyme Bsp1286I (Fig. 3 b). Accordingly, genomic DNA isolated from blood cells of 12 healthy male human individuals was used as template to amplify the 458-bp DNA fragment, and the amplified DNAs were then incubated in the presence ofBsp1286I. In 11 out of 12 individuals the expected DNA fragments of the CaT-Lb variant could be identified, whereas one individual contained both a and b variants (Fig. 3 c). In summary, these findings suggest that the two CaT-L variants may be due to a coupled polymorphism of one gene locus. By using a monochromosomal hybrid mapping panel, this locus was assigned to human chromosome 7 (data not shown). To characterize the electrophysiological properties of CaT-L, CaT-L and GFP were co-expressed in HEK cells using the dicistronic expression vector pdiCaT-L. Whereas only small background currents were observed under control conditions (GFP alone), large inwardly rectifying currents could be recorded in CaT-L-transfected HEK cells after establishing the whole-cell configuration (Fig.4, a–e), indicating that CaT-L forms constitutively active ion channels. Switching the holding potential from the initial −40 to +70 mV, currents increased dramatically in size (Fig. 4, a and e). This increase in current size with a change in holding potential was not observed for sodium currents (at zero extracellular divalent ions) and indicates that CaT-L may be partially inactivated by intracellular Ca2+. For the following experiments voltage ramps were applied from a holding potential of +70 mV. Although the initial characterization of CaT-L currents was reminiscent of currents mediated by ECaC (33Hoenderop J.G. van der, K. A. Hartog A. van, O. C. Willems P.H. Bindels R.J. Biochem. Biophys.

(Lond.). 2000; 527: 239-248Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the sequence differences led us to a more detailed investigation of CaT-L selectivity. CaT-L-specific currents were completely abolished following removal of external Ca2+(Fig. 4, a and c) but slightly increased when external Na+ was removed (summarized in Fig.4 e). The ion exchange experiments and the inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship with the rather positive reversal potential (E rev) provide strong evidence that CaT-L forms Ca2+-selective ion channels (Fig.4, a, c, and e). The Ca2+selectivity, as defined by the E rev, becomes even more evident (Fig. 4 c, inset) if the background current is subtracted (background current defined as the remaining current in the absence of Ca2+). The slight but consistent increase of current size in the absence of Na+ (Fig. 4 e) is largely due to a local perfusion effect as perfusion of unaltered bath solution (puff in Fig. 4 a) revealed a similar increase in current size and could indicate an activation mechanism partially mediated by shape changes. A feature of non-voltage-operated Ca2+-selective ion channels is their ability to conduct Na+ only if all external divalent cations, namely Ca"

To substantiate this we generated isogenic HIV-1 molecularly cloned viruses that were composed of the HxB2 envelope backbone containing the V1V2 and V3 regions from viruses isolated from a patient progressing to disease. We show that the V3 amino acid charge per se had little influence on altering the virus coreceptor phenotype. The V1V2 region and itsN-linked glycosylation degree were shown to confer CXCR4 usage and provide the virus with rapid replication kinetics. Loss of anN-linked glycosylation site within the V3 region had a major influence on the virus switching from the R5 to X4 phenotype in a V3 charge-dependent manner. The loss of this V3N-linked glycosylation site was also linked with the broadening of the coreceptor repertoire to incorporate CCR3. By comparing the amino acid sequences of primary HIV-1 isolates, we identified a strong association between high V3 charge and the loss of this V3 N-linked glycosylation site. These results demonstrate that the N-linked glycosylation pattern of the HIV-1 envelope can strongly influence viral coreceptor utilization and the R5 to X4 switch.

Viruses utilizing CCR5 (R5), also referred to as nonsyncytia-inducing or macrophage tropic (M-tropic) viruses, are those preferentially transmitted, whereas those using CXCR4 (X4), also termed syncytia-inducing (SI) or T cell line tropic (T-tropic) viruses, are those more associated with later stage disease and disease progression (16Connor R.I.

The full molecular events leading to alterations in coreceptor activity or to receptor switching in vivo are not fully understood.

The natural ligands for the CCR5 receptor, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, and MIP-1β, have been shown to inhibit viral entry through either competing for the CCR5 receptor or by down-regulating its surface expression (53Cocchi F.

A virus with altered coreceptor activity is therefore likely to be selected during disease progression as a consequence of chemokine inhibition pressure. Indeed many studies show that minor alterations within the V3 region of the HIV-1 envelope can render a virus resistant to the blocking effects of the CC-chemokines (54Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Cara A. Gallo R.C. Lusso P. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1244-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 55Paxton W.A. Martin S.R. Tse D. O'Brien T.R. Skurnick J. VanDevanter N.L.

A better knowledge of the molecular events contributing to viral evolution, specifically the switch from the R5 to X4 phenotype will be important in broadening our understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis as well as providing information relevant to both HIV-1 therapy design and vaccine development. To define the molecular events involved with the coreceptor switchingin vivo, we created and studied a panel of molecularly cloned viruses based upon the V1V2 and V3 envelope regions of viral isolates derived from an HIV-1-infected individual who has progressed to disease. The V1V2 region was shown to be significant in providing the virus with R5X4 dual tropism but not in affecting the level of CCR5 utilization. Here we demonstrate that the loss of anN-linked glycosylation event within the V3 region of the envelope was significant in determining strong CXCR4 utilization and in the virus switching from the R5 to X4 phenotype. In addition, we have compared the V3 sequences from a large number of primary isolates and found a strong association between an increase in V3 charge and the loss of the V3 N-linked glycosylation event, highlighting its in vivo significance. These results demonstrate that theN-linked glycosylation pattern of the gp120 envelope can contribute to viral coreceptor utilization and switching. The initial panel of molecularly cloned HIV-1 chimeric viruses were composed of the LAI viral backbone carrying the HxB2 envelope where the V3 loop was replaced with the corresponding region amplified from a patient (ACH168) progressed in the disease course. These viruses, termed X, are shown in Fig. 1 A and were created as previously described (22de Jong J.J. de Ronde A. Keulen W. Tersmette M. Goudsmit J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6777-6780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27De Jong J.J. Goudsmit J. Keulen W. Klaver B. Krone W. Tersmette M. de Ronde A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 757-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the X viruses, we have replaced the V1V2 region of the envelope glycoprotein with the corresponding region of a T-tropic isolate, 168.10, originating from the same patient (ACH168) and from a late time point in disease. The new set of viruses, termed X.10, of which the V1 region is shown in Fig. 1 B, were created as follows. The BlueScirpt plasmid was modified for our requirements through replacing the KpnI site with a NcoI site by inserting the linker 5′-TTC CAT GGA AGT AC-3′ at theKpnI site, resulting in the pBSn plasmid. TheNcoI-BamHI fragment of the X virus HIV-1 envelope (HxB2 nucleotides 5675–8475) was sub-cloned into theNcoI-BamHI-cloning sites of the pBSn plasmid, resulting in the pAG plasmid. The KpnI-StuI fragment of the HXB2 envelope (nucleotides 6347–6832) was replaced by the KpnI-StuI fragment of the 168.10 envelope, resulting in the pAGX.10 plasmids. Finally, the envelope constructs were transferred into the pLAI backbone byNcoI-BamHI digestion and ligation, resulting in the X.10 infectious molecular clone plasmids. For all the mutagenesis reactions the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used with the pAG plasmid series as the starting material. All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications. The modification of theN-linked glycosylation site in the V1 loop was achieved with the primers 5′-TGC CAC TAA TGG TAG CTG GGA AAA GAT GGA AAA AGG-3′ and 5′-CCT TTT TCC ATC TTT TCC CAG CTA CCA TTA GTG GCA-3′, which altered the amino acid sequence of the V1 loop from NSTTNATIGSWE to NSTTYATIGSWE. The modification of the N-linked glycosylation site in the V3 loop was achieved with the primers 5′-GAC ATT AAT TGT ACA AGA CCC AAC AAC AAT ATA AGA AAA AGG-3′ and 5′-CCT TTT TCT TAT ATT GTT GTT GGG TCT TGT ACA ATT AAT GTC-3′. The amino acid sequence of the V3 loop changed from CTRPNNNTRK to CTRPNNNIRK, and both amino acid sequences were found in primary isolates derived from individual ACH168. The construction of all molecularly cloned viruses and the production of viral stocks were monitored throughout using the technique of standard automated sequencing. Infectious molecularly cloned HIV-1 viral stocks were generated by transfection of the relevant HIV-expressing plasmid into the human cervical carcinoma cell line C33A. Transfections were performed with 10 μg of plasmid DNA using the CaCl2 precipitation method. All plasmid DNA used for transfection was prepared using Qiagen kits in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA precipitate was split between two wells of C33A cells plated 24 h earlier at 1.5 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well tissue culture plate. Each transfection was performed in a final volume of 8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. The following day, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and given fresh culture media, and the viral stocks were harvested on day 3 of culture in multiple freezing vials after a 0.2 μm filtration step (Millipore). All culture supernatants were assayed at the time of freezing for levels of the viral p24 antigen with a standard p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For all viruses produced, the levels of p24 were within the range 105–106pg/ml. The coreceptor utilization phenotype was determined by measuring viral replication on the U87.CD4+ cell line expressing an array of different chemokine receptors (CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR5, and CXCR4), a gift from Dr. Dan Littman, Skirbill Institute, New York. These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum plus the antibiotics puromycin (1 μg/ml) and neomycin (300 μg/ml). Coreceptor utilization was determined by adding 200 μl of virus stock (between 105 and 106p24 pg/ml) to 3.0 × 104 U87.CD4+ cells (plated 20–24 h previously in a 96-well flat-bottomed culture plate) expressing the specific receptor under analysis. Cells were infected for 18 h before being washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fed with 200 μl of fresh media. On day 10 of the culture, cells were scored for syncytia formation, and the p24 levels in the culture supernatants were determined using a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All viral stocks were assayed for tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) on CD4+-enriched lymphocytes isolated from individuals who did not carry the Δ32CCR5 allele, screened for by standard polymerase chain reaction technique. PBMCs were isolated from fresh buffy coats Central Laboratory Blood Bank, Amsterdam) by standard Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation. PBMCs were frozen in multiple vials at a high concentration and, when required, PBMCs were thawed and activated with 5 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin and cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml) with recombinant interleukin-2 (100 units/ml). On day 4 of culture, the cells underwent CD4+enrichment by incubating with CD8 immunomagnetic beads (Dynal Oslo, Norway) and separating out the CD8+ lymphocytes. CD4+-enriched lymphocytes were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 96-well plates with 5-fold serial dilutions of the virus. The cells were fed on day 7 with fresh media and scored on day 14 for p24 levels, and the number of positive wells were identified. This figure was used to determine the TCID50 value for each virus. PBMCs from the same donor were preferentially used throughout the study to minimize any potential experimental errors resulting from variation between donor cells. Where the same donor PBMC samples were not available, then cells behaving similarly in their replication capacity for R5 viruses were selected. The replication kinetics of each virus was measured by infecting CD4+-enriched lymphocytes from either CCR5+/+or CCR5−/− individuals at 1,000–3,000 TCID50. The kinetics of virus replication were monitored by measuring p24 antigen levels in the culture supernatants on days 4, 7, and 10 of infection. All experimental results with regard to replication kinetics, unless otherwise stated, are representative of three independently performed experiments. We tested for the induced N-linked glycosylation pattern variations by following the electrophoretic mobility of virion-associated gp120 proteins. Infectious viral particles were pelleted (18,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C) from 0.5 ml of culture supernatant harvested from transfected C33A cells. The virus pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. The denatured proteins underwent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 5% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with rabbit-anti-gp120 serum followed by a 1-h incubation with a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, the position of the gp120 glycoprotein on the molecular weight scale was detected by nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color development. Our starting material for this study was a panel of molecularly cloned chimeric viruses that consisted of the HxB2 envelope in the LAI viral backbone. The V3 region of the HxB2 envelope was replaced by the equivalent V3 region from a M-tropic viral isolate (168.1), obtained from a patient early in the disease course (patient ACH168 of the Amsterdam Cohorts Studies) (27De Jong J.J. Goudsmit J. Keulen W. Klaver B. Krone W. Tersmette M. de Ronde A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 757-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the V3 region of this virus was altered by site-directed mutagenesis to resemble the amino acid alterations that confer the positive charge changes seen in the V3 region of a late stage disease, T-tropic viral isolate (168.10). Fig.1 A depicts the V3 amino acid sequence differences between the early and late isolates (168.1 and 168.10) and the sequences of the sequentially altered V3 regions, which confer differences in overall positive charge. An additional virus (G) was generated that provided a further +3-charged V3 envelope for this study. Upon transfection of these viral plasmids into either MT-2 or Sup-T1 cells, the viral phenotype changed from that of M-tropic to T-tropic, as determined by the appearance of syncytia (Fig. 1 A). This result suggested that as the positive charge of the V3 envelope increased, the viruses began to utilize the CXCR4 receptor as a coreceptor for viral entry. To test this hypothesis, we measured the infectivity of viral isolates generated by the transfection of the human C33A cell line on U87.CD4+ cells expressing either the CCR5 or CXCR4 receptors. Surprisingly, we found that all viruses were strong users of the CCR5 receptor, and none were capable of utilizing CXCR4 (Fig. 1 A). The full-length 168.10 viral envelope cloned into the LAI backbone produced a virus that showed strong CXCR4 usage but that could not utilize CCR5 (Fig.1 A). These results demonstrated that the V3 charge alterations, which could confer syncytia formation upon transfection of MT-2 and Sup-T1 cell lines, could not predict successful CXCR4 utilization and thereby suggested that some other region or factors within the envelope were responsible. Since we were unable to confer CXCR4 utilization onto our virus panel by altering V3 charge alone, we tested what effect the V1V2 region had on viral coreceptor utilization. The differences in the V1V2 region between the early isolate (168.1) and the late virus isolate (168.10) as well as the HxB2 virus can be seen in Fig. 1 B. Sequence comparison revealed a strong homology between the V1V2 region of the HxB2 and the 168.1 envelopes, whereas both differed from the 168.10 isolate, with the main difference being the addition of a potentialN-linked glycosylation site in the latter. We generated a panel of viruses where we replaced the V1V2 region of our original panel of viruses (termed X) with the V1V2 region of the late isolate, 168.10. We produced 10 new viruses that encompassed the array of different V3 charges (+3 to +6) (termed X.10). The new viruses along with the original (X) viruses were tested for replication on U87.CD4+ cells expressing either CCR5 or CXCR4 and on CD4+ lymphocytes isolated from individuals homozygous for the Δ32 CCR5 allele (CCR5−/−) or from those who did not carry this allele (CCR5+/+). In this experiment non-diluted viral stocks were used to infect the U87.CD4+ cells, and a 3,000 TCID50 was used to infect the CD4+ lymphocytes. With the original X viruses (top panel, Fig. 2), no replication was seen on the CCR5−/− CD4+lymphocytes, indicating no CXCR4 utilization. With some of the V3 higher charged viruses we did observe slight CXCR4 utilization but at less than 0.1% of that seen for CCR5. Surprisingly, the X.10 viruses, irrespec"

Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar). A major characteristic of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy diseases is the accumulation of an abnormal partially protease-resistant prion protein (PrPSC), which is derived from the normal protease-sensitive prion protein (PrPC). Although accumulation of PrPSC may damage cells of the central nervous system, it is clear that the generation of spongiform encephalopathy requires the presence of both PrPSC and PrPC (2Bueler H.

The abnormal PrPSC is thought to recruit the normal PrPCthrough a proposed trans-conformation process causing the accumulation of PrPSC in the form of plaques and fibrils (3Prusiner S. Scott M.

The cellular prion protein (PrP) is encoded by a single gene corresponding to about 250 amino acids and is highly conserved in vertebrates (4Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E.

PrP is widely expressed, but it appears to accumulate in the central nervous system and the lymphoreticular system. PrP may be produced via several pathways, because it can be found in the extracellular fluid, on the outer surface of the plasma membrane and Golgi, and as a transmembrane form, designated ctmPrP, where the N-terminal domain is oriented within the cytoplasm (7Caughey B. Raymond G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Taraboulos A. Rogers M. Borchelt D. McKinley M. Scott M. Serban D. Prusiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8262-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition, a truncated version of PrP, resulting from a stop codon at position 145 in human PrP (huPrP), is associated with a variant of the GSS syndrome and is found in the cytoplasm (9Zanusso G.

Although PrP is a highly conserved protein in vertebrates, its role remains to be identified. Interestingly, PrP null mice develop normally and appear to be healthy (2Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a number of functions have been proposed for PrP such as superoxide dismutase activity, involvement in copper metabolism (reviewed in Ref. 10Brockes J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 5: 571-577Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and, very recently, participation in signal transduction during neuronal differentiation (11Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M.

In addition, PrP was shown to interact with sulfated glycans (12Caughey B. Brown K. Raymond G. Katzenstein G. Thresher W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2135-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), RNA aptamers (13Weiss S. Neumann M. Groschup M. Kretzschmar H. Famulok M. Winnacker E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8790-8797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and large nucleic acids (14Nandi P.K. Leclerc E. Arch. Virol. 1999; 144: 1751-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,15Akowitz A. Sklaviadis T. Manuelidis L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), causing the formation of nucleoprotein complexes similar to HIV-1 nucleocapsid-RNA complexes formed in vitro (16Darlix J.-L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). A recent report shows that MuLV replication accelerates the scrapie infectious process (17Carp R. Meeker H. Caruso V. Sersen E. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting possible in vivo interactions between retroviruses and PrP. These findings prompted us to compare and contrast the interactions of human PrP and the HIV-1 Gag-encoded nucleocapsid protein with viral nucleic acids. HIV-1, like all retroviruses examined to date (except for the Spumaretroviruses), encodes a major nucleic acid binding protein (NC protein) found in the virion core where about 2000 NC protein molecules completely coat the dimeric RNA genome. The biological roles of NC include the chaperoning of RNA dimerization and packaging during virus assembly and proviral DNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase (RT) in the course of viral infection. These functions of NC are thought to be largely governed by interactions with the HIV-1 5′-leader RNA (16Darlix J.-L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 18Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Grûninger-Leitch F. Nugeyre M.-T. Barré-Sinoussi F. Le Grice S. Darlix J.-L.

Our results show that huPrP largely mimics the chaperone properties of NCp7 with respect to the annealing of complementary nucleic acid strands, viral RNA dimerization, the hybridization of replication primer tRNA3Lys to the HIV-1 5′-primer binding site sequence and the initiation of reverse transcription by RT. These NC-like activities of huPrP appear to map to the N-terminal region of huPrP. Such properties are not unique to huPrP, because the ovine PrP was also found to harbor nucleic acid-chaperoning properties similar to those of HIV-1 NCp7 and retroviral nucleocapsid proteins (reviewed in Ref. 16Darlix J.-L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The full-length human PrP (huPrP), and the fragments huPrP-(23–144) (N-terminal region) and huPrP-(122–231) (C-terminal region) were produced in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (21Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P.G. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The ovine PrP (ovPrP) (residues 25–234) was prepared using a similar protocol (22Rezaei H. Marc D. Choiset Y. Takahashi M. Hui Bon Hoa G. Haertlé T. Grosclaude J. Debey P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2833-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The purity of the proteins was higher than 95% as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein NCp7, NCp7-(12–53), and Vpr were synthesized by the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/opfp chemical method and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (23De Rocquigny H.

Proteins were dissolved at 1 mg/ml in buffer containing 30 mm Hepes, pH 6.5, 30 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm ZnCl2. DNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the Tar(−) 57 nt of HIV-1 sequences (pNL4.3 molecular clone) was from Eurogentec (Belgium). HIV-1 5′-leader RNA corresponding to nucleotides 1–415 was generatedin vitro as previously described (18Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Grûninger-Leitch F. Nugeyre M.-T. Barré-Sinoussi F. Le Grice S. Darlix J.-L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and phenol and chloroform extracted and purified by gel filtration. HIV-1 3′-RNA of 650 nt (positions 8583–9208 of the HIV-1 genome) with a poly(A) tail was prepared by transcription in vitro(27Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Pernelle C. Borie C. Darlix J.-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 63: 2434-2441Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Natural bovine tRNA3Lys from beef liver was a kind gift of Gérard Keith (Strasbourg, France). Synthetic tRNA3Lys was generated in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT p66/p51), purified from E. coli, was provided by S. Le Grice (Frederick, MD). HIV-1 integrase (INp32), purified from E. coli, was provided by J.-F. Mouscadet (Villejuif, France). All plasmid DNAs were amplified in E. coli 1035 (RecA−) and purified by affinity chromatography (Qiagen protocol). Reactions with HIV-132P-labeled 5′-RNA, and either PrP or HIV-1 NCp7 were performed for 10 min at 37 °C in 10 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mm ZnCl2, and 1.5 pmol of RNA. PrP or NCp7 was at the indicated molar protein to nucleotide ratios. Reactions were stopped by 5 mm EDTA, and samples were electrophoresed on a 1.3% agarose gel in 50 mm Tris·borate, pH 8.3. Gels were visualized by ethidium bromide staining followed by gel fixation in 5% trichloroacetic acid, drying, and autoradiography. To pellet nucleoprotein complexes, reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 10,000 × g. Reactions with HIV-1 RNA,32P-labeled tRNA, or 32P-labeled minus strand Tar DNA (Tar−) and either PrP or HIV-1 NCp7 were performed for 10 min at 37 °C in 10 μl of a buffer containing 20 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, 0.2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mmZnCl2, 5 units of RNasin (Promega), 1.5 pmol of RNA, 3 pmol of tRNA; or Tar(−) and PrP or NCp7 at the indicated molar protein to nt ratios. Reactions were stopped by SDS/EDTA (0.5%/5 mm), and samples were treated with proteinase K (2 μg) for 10 min at room temperature, phenol-chloroform was extracted, and RNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.3% agarose in 50 mm Tris·borate, pH 8.3. Gels were visualized by ethidium bromide staining followed by gel fixation in 5% trichloroacetic acid, drying, and autoradiography. A 0.16- to 1.77-kb RNA ladder was used for size determination. The percentage of primer annealed to the HIV-1 RNA was determined by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograph. First the nucleic acid annealing assay was carried out in 10 μl for 5 min at 37 °C as above, and next the reaction volume was increased to 25 μl by addition of 2 pmol of HIV-1 RT, 0.25 mm each of dNTPs, 60 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mmMgCl2. Samples were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped and processed as for the analysis of nucleic acid annealing, except that after phenol extraction, nucleic acids were ethanol-precipitated, recovered by centrifugation, dissolved in formamide, denatured at 95 °C for 2 min, and analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 7 m urea and 0.5× TBE, pH 8.3. 5′-32P-Labeled FX174 DNAHinf markers (Promega) were used for size determination (not shown). The levels of cDNA synthesized by RT were quantified by densitometric scanning. 293T cells, derived from the HEK cell line (human embryonic kidney cells), were cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) complemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), andl-glutamine (2 mm). Transfection of 293T cells were performed using the calcium phosphate method with 3 μg of pDNA-huPrP for 106 cells. After 10 days under puromycin selection (0.7 μg/ml), resistant cell colonies were expanded and found to express huPrP. For immunohistochemistry, cells were grown in eight-well Labtek chamber slides and fixed in ice-cold 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. They were then washed twice in PBS and incubated for 30 min in a blocking solution of PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin, 1% normal goat serum, and 0.2% Tween 20 prior to staining with antibodies. This same solution served to dilute the anti-PrP SAF 37 antibody (IgG2a recognizing amino acids 79–92 of huPrP) used at 1/200 dilution, and the rhodamine-conjugated Helix pomatialectin, which was included with the primary antibody in some experiments at a concentration of 5 μg/ml (kindly provided by Dr. F. Barde, ENS, Lyon, France). Primary incubation was for 2 h at room temperature. After washing sections 5 × 10 min in PBS, bound antibodies were revealed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin at a final dilution of 1/400 in blocking buffer containing bis-benzimide (1 μg/ml) to stain DNA. Controls included no primary antibody and non-transfected cells. Slides were washed three times in PBS, mounted with moviol and analyzed with a Zeiss axioplan fluorescence microscope, and a Zeiss axiovert inverting microscope equipped with 488- and 514-nm lasers and LSM 510 software for confocal analysis. HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein NCp7 is a small Gag-encoded protein. During the infectious process NCp7 is required to chaperone proviral DNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase (RT) (Fig.1 A) (16Darlix J.-L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 18Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Grûninger-Leitch F. Nugeyre M.-T. Barré-Sinoussi F. Le Grice S. Darlix J.-L.

In addition, NCp7 is pivotal in virus assembly, because it recruits the genomic RNA and chaperones its dimerization and packaging into assembling particles (Fig. 1 A). Interactions between the HIV-1 5′-leader RNA and NCp7 appear to govern these viral processes (Fig. 1 A). NCp7 with the two zinc fingers and an NCp7 mutant, designated NCp7-(12–53), without the basic N- and C-terminal domains necessary for RNA dimerization in vitro and virus assembly in vivo(16Darlix J.-L.

Roques B. Darlix J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Recombinant huPrP-(23–231) and the N (23)- and C (122)-terminal regions were produced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity (21Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P.G. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To compare the nucleic acid binding abilities of PrP and HIV-1 NCp7, we used the multifunctional 5′-leader of HIV-1 (Fig. 1), because it is formed of contiguous functional domains that are required for viral DNA transcription (TAR and poly(A) stem-loops), minus strand DNA synthesis by RT (5′-primer binding site for initiation and Tar for strand transfer), viral RNA dimerization and packaging (DIS and DLS), and translation (the AUG of Gag) (Fig. 1). NCp7 interacts with the DIS-DLS domains to chaperone viral RNA dimerization and packaging during virus assembly and with the 5′-primer binding site and TAR sequences during minus strand DNA synthesis by RT in the course of infection (16Darlix J.-L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 19Mak J. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8087-8095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As observed previously (18Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Grûninger-Leitch F. Nugeyre M.-T. Barré-Sinoussi F. Le Grice S. Darlix J.-L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), NCp7 binds in a cooperative manner to the multifunctional 5′-leader of HIV-1 RNA and forms nucleoprotein complexes (Fig. 2, lanes 2–4), whereas the NCp7 mutant (12–53) does not form stable complexes (lanes 6–8). huPrP binds to the 5′-leader RNA as evidenced by the formation of nucleoprotein complexes (lanes 14–16). The N-terminal fragment (23) of huPrP was also able to bind to the 5′-leader RNA (lanes 18–20) in a manner similar to NCp7 (lanes 2–4), whereas the C-terminal fragment (122) did not show any RNA binding affinity (lanes 22–24). The ovine PrP was also expressed in E. coli as a recombinant protein and purified to homogeneity (not shown). The ovine PrP also formed nucleoprotein complexes in a dose-dependent manner similar to NCp7 (lanes 10–12). These NC- and PrP-nucleoprotein complexes are of high molecular mass, because they can be recovered by 5-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g (data not shown) (26Rascle J.-B. Ficheux D. Darlix J.-L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The interactions of PrP with nucleic acids suggested that this cellular protein might have RNA and DNA annealing activities similar to those of HIV-1 NCp7 or the human p53 protein (27Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Pernelle C. Borie C. Darlix J.-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 63: 2434-2441Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This was examined using HIV-1 sequences corresponding to TAR and the 3′-region of the HIV-1 RNA genome corresponding to U3, TAR, and poly(A) sequences (Fig. 1 A). The minus strand TAR sequence (Tar−) represents the 3′-end of the so-called strong stop cDNA (ss-cDNA(−)), the initial product of reverse transcription. Under physiological conditions, NCp7 directed annealing of Tar− to Tar+ present within the 3′-RNA (Fig.3, lanes 2–4). Interestingly, huPrP was also able to hybridize Tar− to the 3′-RNA in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 13–15). A similar level of hybridization was obtained with huPrP-(23–144) (lanes 17–19). On the other hand, NCp7-(12–53) and huPrP-(122–231) did not direct annealing of Tar− to HIV-1 3′-RNA (lanes 5–7and 21–23, respectively). The ovine PrP (ovPrP) was found to be as effective as huPrP and HIV-1 NCp7 in directing the specific annealing reaction (lanes 9–11). These data demonstrate that PrP of human or ovine origin has nucleic acid annealing activity characteristic of HIV-1 NCp7 and retroviral NC proteins in general (16Darlix J.-L.

In the viral particle, the retroviral genome is dimeric and has replication primer tRNA annealed to the primer binding site, which constitutes the start site for reverse transcription (see Fig. 1 A). As demonstrated before, genomic RNA dimerization and tRNA annealing to the primer binding site are promoted by NC protein. In control experiments we used well characterized nucleic acid binding proteins of viral origin such as retroviral reverse transcriptases (RT), HIV-1 Vpr and integrase, T4 gp32 or nucleic acid binding proteins of cellular origin like E. coli RecA and human p53. All these proteins, some of which have nucleic acid chaperone properties (40Herschlag D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20871-20874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), were found to be inactive in these viral processes (see Refss 18 and 23 for RTs and E. coli RecA; Ref. 27Lapadat-Tapolsky M.

Using the HIV-1 system with the multifunctional 5′-leader RNA and primer tRNA3Lys (Fig. 1 B) NCp7 was indeed critical for HIV-1 RNA dimerization and primer tRNA3Lys annealing to the primer binding site (Fig. 4, A andB, lanes 2–4) (18Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Grûninger-Leitch F. Nugeyre M.-T. Barré-Sinoussi F. Le Grice S. Darlix J.-L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 23De Rocquigny H. Gabus C.

Interestingly, we found for the first time that a cellular protein, namely PrP, was capable of promoting HIV-1 RNA dimer formation and tRNA3Lys annealing to the primer binding site in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 14–16for huPrP). Very similar data were obtained with the N terminus (23) of huPrP (lanes 18–20). NCp7-(12–53) retained little activity (lanes 6–8) (16Darlix J.-L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and the C-terminal fragment (122) of huPrP was completely inactive (lanes 22–24). The ovine PrP (ovPrP) was also found to show an NC-like activity, because it directed HIV-1 RNA dimerization and primer tRNA3Lys annealing to the primer binding site (lanes 10–12). Reverse transcription of the viral RNA is initiated by RT-mediated extension of the primer tRNA hybridized to the primer binding site by NCp7 (Figs. 1 A and5 A). NCp7 was indeed critical for the initiation of minus strand cDNA synthesis (Fig.5 B, compare lanes 1 and 2–4) (1Prusiner S.

Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Once again, huPrP was found to duplicate the properties of NCp7 by actively promoting initiation of reverse transcription in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5 B, lanes 8–10). The N-terminal fragment (23) of huPrP exhibited part of this activity (lanes 11–13). NCp7-(12–53) retained some activity, but only at a high protein to nt ratio (lanes 5and 6, protein to nt molar ratio of 1:3) (16Darlix J.-L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The C-terminal fragment (122) of huPrP was completely inactive (lanes 14 and 15). Similarly to huPrP, the full-length ovine PrP was also very active in chaperoning the initiation of reverse transcription (lanes 16 and17). A succession of specific events is required for the conversion of the genomic RNA into a complete proviral DNA with the two LTRs. Nevertheless, nonspecific replicative events can take place, such as self-initiation of reverse transcription, which is enhanced by template interactions, nicks in the genome or folding back of the template (31Lapadat-Tapolsky M.

Retroviral NC proteins behave as nucleic acid chaperones, which can destabilize RNA secondary structures and thus inhibit self priming of reverse transcription (see scheme in Fig. 6 A) (31Lapadat-Tapolsky M.

A 650-nt RNA, with a 25-nt poly(A) tail, corresponding to the 3′-region of the HIV-1 genomic RNA was used to mimic resumption of minus strand cDNA synthesis after minus strand transfer (Fig. 1 B) (31Lapadat-Tapolsky M.

https://openalex.org/W2022023397,"Mammalian selenocysteine-containing proteins characterized with respect to function are involved in redox processes and exhibit distinct expression patterns and cellular locations. A recently identified 15-kDa selenoprotein (Sep15) has no homology to previously characterized proteins, and its function is not known. Here we report the intracellular localization and identification of a binding partner for this selenoprotein which implicate Sep15 in the regulation of protein folding. The native Sep15 isolated from rat prostate and mouse liver occurred in a complex with a 150-kDa protein. The latter protein was identified as UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGTR), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein, which was previously shown to be involved in the quality control of protein folding. UGTR functions by glucosylating misfolded proteins, retaining them in the ER until they are correctly folded or transferring them to degradation pathways. To determine the intracellular localization of Sep15, we expressed a green fluorescent protein-Sep15 fusion protein in CV-1 cells, and this protein was localized to the ER and possibly other perinuclear compartments. We determined that Sep15 contained the N-terminal signal peptide that was essential for translocation and that it was cleaved in the mature protein. However, C-terminal sequences of Sep15 were not involved in trafficking and retention of Sep15. The data suggest that the association between Sep15 and UGTR is responsible for maintaining the selenoprotein in the ER. This report provides the first example of the ER-resident selenoprotein and suggests a possible role of the trace element selenium in the quality control of protein folding.

It is present in the form of a selenocysteine (Sec)1 residue in several naturally occurring enzymes and proteins (1Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 2Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). In selenoenzymes with established function, such as glutathione peroxidases, thyroid hormone deiodinases, and thioredoxin reductases in mammals, and hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases in bacteria and archaea, Sec is present at the enzyme active center and participates in various redox reactions (2Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Functions of many other mammalian selenoproteins, including the 15-kDa selenoprotein (Sep15), selenoprotein P, selenoprotein W, selenoprotein R (also named selenoprotein X), selenoprotein T, and selenoprotein N, have not been established. However, most of these proteins have clearly identifiable Sec-containing redox motifs, such as the Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Sec motif in selenoprotein W and selenoprotein T, suggesting their possible involvement in redox processes (3Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. J. Biomed. Sci. 1999; 6: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Sep15 was recently identified in human T-cells (4Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.T. Wootton J.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8910-8915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The gene for this protein is expressed in various human tissues with highest expression levels in the prostate and thyroid. In addition to humans, genes encoding Sep15 were detected in mice and rats. Sep15 exhibits no homology to previously characterized proteins, which precluded its functional characterization. However, Sep15 has a highly conserved motif, Cys-Gly-Sec-Lys, suggesting that this center could constitute an active center, in which Sec and Cys form a reversible seleno-sulfide bond. Besides this putative redox center, a previously noted feature in the Sep15 sequence was the lack of N-terminal sequences in the isolated human T-cell selenoprotein, which suggested the possibility of post-translational processing of the protein. In addition, Sep15 migrated as the 15-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE gels, whereas the migration properties of the native protein were consistent with a protein of ∼160–240 kDa. The low abundance of the 15-kDa selenoprotein in human T-cells and its lability during isolation did not permit isolation of the native protein to homogeneity to test whether the 160-kDa complex was composed of multiple selenoprotein subunits or if other protein components were involved in the complex (4Gladyshev V.N.

In this report, we describe isolation of Sep15 from rat prostate and mouse liver. In both preparations, the native selenoprotein occurred as a complex with UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGTR), an enzyme involved in the quality control of protein folding (6Parodi A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Further characterization revealed that Sep15 was located in perinuclear cellular compartments, consistent with the finding that UGTR is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The observation that Sep15 was found only in a complex with UGTR suggests that it may be involved in the regulation of protein folding. Rat prostate and mouse liver were purchased from Pel-Freez. [75Se]Selenious acid (specific activity 1,000 Ci/mmol) was from the University of Missouri Research Reactor Facility (Columbia, MO). Phenyl-TSK and DEAE-TSK HPLC columns were from TosoHaas. The phenyl-Superose FPLC column, Q-Sepharose, and ConA-Sepharose were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. LipofectAMINE was from Life Technologies, Inc. Polyclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibodies were from Invitrogen. Escherichia colistrain NovaBlue was from Novagen. The Maxi kit for plasmid isolation was from Qiagen, BODIPY®TR ceramide was from Molecular Probes, native and SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblot membranes were from Novex, and immunoblot detection systems ECL-Plus and SuperSignal were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Pierce, respectively. Other reagents were of the highest quality available. Rat cell line RLE was grown on RPMI 1640 medium for 48 h in the presence of 0.5 mCi of sodium [75Se]selenite/100 ml of cell culture medium. Cells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, collected by trypsinization, and stored at −80 °C prior to use.75Se-Labeled mouse liver was obtained as described (7Gladyshev V.N. Factor V.M. Housseau F. Hatfield D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 mCi of freshly neutralized [75Se]selenious acid was injected intraperitoneally, the mouse was sacrificed 48 h later, and 75Se-labeled tissues were collected and stored at −80 °C prior to use. 133 g of rat prostate was mixed with 75Se-labeled rat RLE cells and homogenized at 4 °C in 400 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm AEBSF, 1 mm DTT, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and the homogenate was further treated by sonication. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a 200-ml Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT (buffer A). After washing the column with 2 volumes of buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted by application of a linear gradient from buffer A to 1m NaCl in buffer A. 75Se was determined with a γ-counter, and column fractions containing peaks of radioactivity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by detection of 75Se on gels with a PhosphorImager. Fractions containing the75Se-labeled Sep15 were identified based on migration properties of this protein on SDS-PAGE, combined, concentrated, made in 1 m NaCl, filtered, and applied to a phenyl-HPLC column equilibrated in 1 m NaCl in buffer A. The protein was eluted by application of a linear gradient from 1 m NaCl in buffer A to buffer A, and the column was washed further with a short gradient from buffer A to water, which eluted Sep15. Fractions containing 75Se were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by the PhosphorImager analysis as described above. Fractions containing Sep15 were then applied directly to a DEAE-HPLC column equilibrated in buffer A. Sep15 was eluted with a gradient from buffer A to 0.5 mNaCl in buffer A. Radioactive fractions were concentrated and stored at −80 °C until ready for use. Fractions containing Sep15 were analyzed on native and SDS-PAGE gels. To determine if the ∼160-kDa protein band, which appeared on native gels and was labeled with 75Se, contained Sep15 and UGTR, a native PAGE gel was briefly stained with Coomassie Blue, the band of interest cut from the gel, minced, incubated overnight in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 10 mm DTT, and the liquid fraction analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The 150-kDa protein band, which appeared on an SDS-PAGE gel after staining with Ponceau S, was used for the subsequent sequence analysis. A gel slice containing a Ponceau S-stained 150-kDa protein band was sent to Harvard Microchem (Boston) where the protein was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase chromatography and their masses determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. Four tryptic peptides were sequenced by Edman degradation comprising a total of 88 amino acid residues. Initial fractionations of mouse liver Sep15 and UGTR were carried out as described for rat prostate. Subsequent isolations took advantage of the fact that UGTR could be isolated efficiently by affinity chromatography on a ConA-Sepharose resin. 150 g of mouse liver was mixed with 3 g of 75Se-labeled mouse liver and homogenized at 4 °C in 3 volumes of buffer A containing 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors used in the rat prostate fractionation. The homogenate was sonicated, clarified by centrifugation, and the clear supernatant was applied to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A. The bound proteins were eluted using a linear 0–1.5 m gradient of NaCl in buffer A. Fractions were analyzed for the presence of 75Se-labeled proteins as described for rat prostate. The fractions containing labeled Sep15 were combined, concentrated, and applied to a ConA-Sepharose column that was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5m NaCl (buffer B). The column was washed with buffer B, and proteins were eluted by the application of a step gradient of 10, 50, 100, 200, and 300 mm methyl α-d-mannopyranoside in buffer B. Fractions containing75Se-labeled Sep15 were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a phenyl-HPLC column as described for rat prostate. The protein was eluted in two overlapping peaks, the first peak containing both UGTR and Sep15, and the second peak containing only UGTR. Fractions containing Sep15 were pooled and subsequently applied onto a DEAE-HPLC column as described above. Proteins eluted from the DEAE column were analyzed by native and SDS-PAGE and by immunoblot assays with antibodies specific for Sep15 or UGTR. N-Sep15-C-GFP denotes the following: N is the 28-residue N-terminal signal peptide of Sep15; Sep15 is the 15-kDa selenoprotein without its signal peptide and 4 C-terminal residues; C is the C-terminal tetrapeptide of Sep15; and GFP is the 239-residue GFP. N-Sep15-C-GFP and Sep15-C-GFP constructs were made using the pEGFP-N1 expression vector. Human Sep15 cDNA (U93C), in which the Sec codon, TGA, was mutated to a cysteine codon, TGC, was amplified with primers T7 and XhoI-15-1h (5′-CCACTCGAGGCGTTCCAACTTTTCACT-3′) and designated N-Sep15-C-GFP. U93C amplified with primers Sal-15-1h (5′-CGCAACGTCGACATGTCTGCTTTTGGGGCAGAG-3′) and XhoI-15-1h was designated Sep15-C-GFP. The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the XhoI site of pEGFP-N1. The GFP-Sep15-C construct was made using the pEGFP-C3 expression vector. Human Sep15 mutant cDNA, U93C, was amplified with primers Sal-15-1h and T3 and cloned into the XhoI/Bsp120I sites of pEGFP-C3. The fragment encoding N-terminal sequences of the 15-kDa protein was obtained by amplification of the U93C cDNA with primers T7-NheI, 5′-CGATGCTAGCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′, andAgeI-15-1h, 5′-CACGACCGGTGCCTCCGATGAAAACTCTGCC-3′. N-GFP-Sep15-C and N-GFP constructs were made by cloning this fragment into the NheI/AgeI sites of GFP-Sep15-C and pEGFP-N1, respectively. The N-GFP-Sep15 construct was obtained by mutagenesis of N-GFP-Sep15-C with primers 15-1h-159stopF, 5′-CCTGAGTGAAAAGTAGGAACGCATATAAATCTTGC-3′ and 15-1h-159stopR, 5′-GCAAGATTTATATGCGTTCCTACTTTTCACTCAGG-3′. All constructs were transformed into the E. coli strain NovaBlue, and the plasmids were isolated using a Maxi kit. Immunoblot assays with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against UGTR isolated from rat liver (8Trombetta S.E. Parodi A.J. J. Biol.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for GFP were used for the detection of GFP-Sep15 fusion proteins with an ECL system. Growth of monkey CV-1 cells and transfection were carried out as described (9Kryukov G.V. Kryukov V.M. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33888-33897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). 5 μg of plasmid DNA and 30 μl of LipofectAMINE were used for transfection of each 60-mm plate. CV-1 cells transfected with the appropriate constructs were incubated for 12 h in a CO2 incubator. We used a fluorescent BODIPY®TR ceramide as a reference marker for perinuclear structures. This reagent has been shown to be accumulated in the ER and Golgi and has been used to study protein trafficking (10Kok L.W. Babia T. Klappe K. Egea G. Hoekstra D. Biochem.

The transfected cells were rinsed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES (DMEM-HEPES) and then incubated for 25 min at room temperature in the same medium containing 2 μm BODIPY®TR ceramide. The cells were washed twice in serum-free DMEM-HEPES and were used immediately for image collection. Double-labeled images of live cells were collected with a water immersion lens using a dual excitation/emission and dual channel mode on a Bio-Rad MRC1024ES laser-scanning microscope. Sep15 was previously isolated from a human T-cell line, but small amounts of isolated proteins and protein lability precluded molecular characterization of native Sep15 (4Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.T. Wootton J.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8910-8915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies found that the protein is expressed at higher levels in the prostate (4Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.T. Wootton J.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol.

In the present study, a procedure for isolation of Sep15 from rat prostate was developed which included fractionation of protein extracts on conventional Q-Sepharose and phenyl-HPLC columns followed by an HPLC procedure on a DEAE column. To allow efficient detection of Sep15 in chromatographic fractions by tracing γ-radioactivity, rat prostate homogenates were mixed with the75Se-labeled extracts obtained from a rat cell line, and the combined extract was used for further isolation. Immunoblot and PhosphorImager detection of Sep15 on gradient nondenaturing and SDS-denaturing PAGE gels in fractions from the first two columns revealed that the native protein migrated as a large, ∼165-kDa, species. However, these same fractions migrated as the 15-kDa species on SDS-PAGE gels (data not shown). Although native gradient PAGE does not accurately determine the molecular weight of a protein, an 11-fold difference in masses between denaturing and nondenaturing conditions suggested that the native Sep15 was bound to another protein or proteins in the rat prostate or was composed of multiple identical selenoprotein subunits. These data were also consistent with the previous electrophoretic and gel filtration experiments of partially purified human T-cell Sep15 (4Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.T. Wootton J.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8910-8915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of the protein preparation isolated by the three purification steps described above is shown in Fig.1. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a Coomassie Blue-stained band of ∼165 kDa (Fig. 1 A,lane 3). This band contained Sep15 as it was labeled with75Se and was immunoreactive with anti-Sep15 antibodies (data not shown). SDS-PAGE analysis of the 165-kDa band showed that it consisted of a 150-kDa protein and Sep15 (Fig. 1 B,lane 2). It was noted that the 150-kDa protein was also present in a selenoprotein-free form (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) which eluted later than the 150-kDa protein-Sep15 complex from a phenyl-HPLC column. In contrast, we were not able to detect Sep15 that was free of the 150-kDa protein in rat prostate fractions. The 150-kDa protein was digested with trypsin, and the sequence of four peptides consisting of a total of 88 amino acid residues was determined (Fig.2). Two of these peptides were not homologous to any known sequences, but the other two showed partial sequence homology with Drosophila melanogaster UGTR (GenBank accession number U20554) (12Parker C.G. Fessler L.I. Nelson R.E. Fessler J.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). During these initial studies, no mammalian UGTR sequences were available in GenBank. However, all four 150-kDa protein peptides were identical with internal peptides of the rat liver UGTR sequence that was deduced from the corresponding cDNA sequence (kindly provided by Dr. A. Parodi). In addition, several mammalian UGTR sequences subsequently became available in GenBank, including rat UGTR (accession number AF200359) (13Tessier D. Dignard D. Zapun A. Radominska-Pandya A. Parodi A.J. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and two human UGTRs (accession numbers AF227905 and AF227906) (14Arnold S.M. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2149-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Sequences of internal peptides obtained from the 150-kDa protein were identical with the internal sequences of the rat protein and were highly homologous with the human sequences. This further confirmed that the 150-kDa protein is UGTR. The relative locations of the four peptide sequences within rat liver UGTR are shown in Fig. 2 B. UGTR has been shown to be responsible for the quality control of protein folding in yeast and vertebrates (6Parodi A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This protein is located in the ER and functions by reglucosylating misfolded proteins in the ER lumen, thus allowing them to interact with calnexin/calreticulin chaperones (15Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 16Ritter C. Helenius A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 278-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). UGTR and Sep15 were also detected by Western analysis in fractions from a phenyl-HPLC column (Fig. 3). UGTR eluted in two overlapping peaks, the first of which contained Sep15 (Fig. 1 A, lane 3; Fig. 3, lanes 1,3, 5, and 7), whereas the second peak did not contain the selenoprotein (Fig. 1 A, lane 2; Fig. 3, lanes 2, 4, 6, and8). The proteins shown in Fig. 3 were separated by SDS-PAGE in the presence (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2, and5 and 6) and absence (Fig. 3, lanes 2–4, and 7 and 8) of a reducing agent DTT, which did not influence mobility of UGTR and Sep15 on SDS-PAGE. This suggests that the isolated UGTR·Sep15 complex did not contain a significant amount of interprotein disulfide bonds. To determine whether the association between Sep15 and UGTR is a general phenomenon rather than a cell type-specific event, we fractionated mouse liver extracts and tested elution patterns of these two proteins (Figs. 4 and 5). Initially, 75Se-labeled liver homogenates were fractionated on DEAE and phenyl columns, and protein fractions were analyzed for the presence of UGTR by immunoblot assays and for the presence of Sep15 by detection of 75Se with a PhosphorImager. These assays revealed that UGTR and Sep15 coeluted from these columns (Fig. 4). We further attempted isolation of UGTR to near homogeneity and tested whether isolated UGTR contained Sep15. For this purpose, we utilized a ConA column, which is an affinity column used previously in the purification of UGTR (8Trombetta S.E. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9236-9240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as an additional intermediate step. The apparently homogeneous preparation of UGTR was then analyzed by immunoblot assays for the presence of Sep15. Analyses of five subsequent fractions from the phenyl column in the procedure that employed the ConA column are shown in Fig. 5. Detection of proteins on native (Fig. 5 A) and SDS-PAGE (Fig.5 B) gels with antibodies specific for rat liver UGTR, as well as the use of antibodies specific for Sep15 on native (Fig.5 C) and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 D) gels, suggested coelution of these proteins. Overall, these data suggested that mouse liver preparations contained Sep15 bound to UGTR. However, further studies are required to address the quantitative relationship between the UGTR·Sep15 complex and the remaining cellular UGTR.Figure 5Immunoblot analyses of UGTR and Sep15 on native and SDS-PAGE gels. Mouse liver extracts were fractionated on Q-Sepharose, ConA-Sepharose, phenyl-HPLC, and DEAE-HPLC columns as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sep15 was detected during isolation by the PhosphorImager and immunoblot assays and UGTR, by immunoblot assays. Late eluting fractions from a phenyl column were electrophoresed, transblotted, and blots were probed with antibodies specific for Sep15 or UGTR.

Ganan S.A. Parodi A.J. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we determined the cellular location of Sep15. For this study, we employed a set of constructs that encoded various fusion proteins between Sep15 and GFP (Fig. 6). These constructs lacked a 3′-untranslated region of Sep15 gene which contains the Sec insertion sequence element (5Kumaraswamy E. Malykh A. Korotkov K.V. Kozyavkin S. Hu Y. Kwon S.Y. Moustafa M.E.

All known eukaryotic selenoprotein genes, including Sep15, contain Sec insertion sequence elements, which are stem-loop structures located in 3′-untranslated regions and are necessary to dictate Sec insertion and prevent termination of protein synthesis at in-frame UGA codons (1Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 18Berry M.J. Banu L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Accordingly, to express a full-size polypeptide in the absence of the Sec insertion sequence element, TGA that encodes Sec at position 93 in Sep15 was replaced in these constructs with TGC that encodes cysteine. These mutations were made to increase translation efficiency because efficiency of selenoprotein synthesis from transfected constructs in mammalian cells is low (19Tujebajeva R.M. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6288-6294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The constructs were transiently transfected into monkey CV-1 cells, and confocal microscopy was used to localize fusion proteins by detecting the GFP green fluorescence (Fig.7). To determine the location of the transiently expressed proteins, we used a cell-permeable fluorescent ceramide conjugate, which is known to label the ER and Golgi (11Ilgoutz S.C. Mullin K.A. Southwell B.R. McConville M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3643-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of fusion proteins and their experimental molecular masses was obtained by assaying transfected cellular extracts by immunoblot assays with anti-GFP antibodies (Fig.8). Sep15 was located in the membranous reticular structures in the perinuclear region, when it was transiently expressed in the form fused through its C-terminal region to GFP (Fig.7).Figure 7Confocal microscopy.

This is the first time that trimers have been identified from peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of ferulic acid, and their formation appears to be favored by decarboxylation of dehydrodimer intermediates. After initial oxidation, the coupling reactions appear to be determined by the chemistry of ferulic acid phenoxy radicals, regardless of the enzyme and of whether the reaction is performedin vitro or in vivo. This claim is supported by our finding that horseradish peroxidase provides a similar product profile. Furthermore, two of the dehydrodimers were the two products obtained from laccase-catalyzed oxidation (Tatsumi, K. S., Freyer, A., Minard, R. D., and Bollag, J.-M. (1994) Environ. Sci.

Our results also indicate that the dehydrodimers and trimers are further oxidized by lignin peroxidase, suggesting that they are only intermediates in the polymerization of ferulic acid.

Lignin peroxidase (LIP)1is considered to be one of the most important enzymes of the extracellular lignin degradation system secreted by the white rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium (1Hatakka A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 125-135Crossref Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Although LIP shares spectral and kinetic features with other peroxidases, the enzyme has several unique characteristics, including a redox potential higher than those of other peroxidases (2Kersten D.J. Kalyanaraman B. Hammel K.E. Reinhammer B. Kent Kirk T. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 3Hammel K.E. Kalyanaraman B. Kent Kirk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 16948-16952Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The high redox potential enables LIP to oxidize aromatic compounds with calculated ionization potential (IP) values of up to 9.0 eV (4ten Have R. Rietjens I.M.C.M. Hartmans S. Swarts H.J. Field J.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This has striking implications when considering the potential applications of peroxidases for useful biotransformations (5Colonna S. Gaggero N. Richelmi C. Pasta P. Trends Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 163-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 6May S.W. Curr. Opin.

Eng. 1999; 63: 74-108Google Scholar). LIP can be expected to oxidize a wider range of substrates and therefore have potential applications unsuitable for less potent peroxidases. Phenols are oxidized by peroxidases to generate phenoxy radicals, which couple with other substrate molecules to form dimeric, oligomeric, and polymeric products. This phenomenon can be exploited for the biocatalytic production of useful oligomers and polymers (6May S.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Adam W. Lazarus M. Saha-Möller C.R. Weichold O. Hoch U. Häring D. Schreier P. Adv. Biochem. Eng. 1999; 63: 74-108Google Scholar), as well as for the treatment of wastewater streams polluted with toxic phenols (8Aitken, M. D. (1993) Chem. Eng. J. B49–B58Google Scholar, 9Klibanov A.M.

Science. 1985; 228: 1434-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Ferulic acid (FA), which is an extremely abundant and widespread cinnamic acid derivative (11Rosazza J.P.N. Huang Z. Dostal L. Volm T. Rousseau B. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), was chosen as a model substrate for studying the initial steps of LIP-catalyzed polymerization of phenolic compounds in vitro. In vivo, peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of FA esterified to primary plant cell wall polysaccharides results in the formation of FA dehydrodimers, believed to enhance the rigidity and strength of the cell wall. A range of regio-isomeric dehydrodimers identified and quantified in several plant cell walls include products of β-β′, β-5′, β-O-4′, 4-O-5′, and 5–5′ radical coupling (12Ralph J. Quideau S. Grabber J.H. Hatfield R.D. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1994; 1: 3485-3498Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 13Micard V. Grabber H. Ralph J. Renard C.M.G.C. Thibault J.-F.

Faulds C.B. Kroon P.A. Waldron K.W. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G. Williamson G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 208-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such dehydrodimers, along with FA, are also believed to act as nucleation sites in the lignification process, coupling with lignin monomers (16Ralph J. Hatfield R. Grabber J. Polyphénols Actualités. 1997; 17: 4-6Google Scholar). This clearly indicates that FA dehydrodimers can be further oxidized. Indeed, certain dehydrodimers formed from oxidative coupling of FA have been reported to be more effective antioxidants than FA itself (17Garcia-Conesa M.T. Plumb G.W. Kroon P.A. Wallace G. Williamson G. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Garcia-Conesa M.T. Wilson P.D. Plumb G.W. Williamson G. J. Sci. Food Agri. 1999; 79: 379-384Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Their antioxidant activity appears to be related to the existence of a full conjugation system in the molecule. Nevertheless, the formation of higher molecular weight oligomers and polymers from FA is undefined. A recent report indicates that ferulate trimers and larger coupling products are formed in cultured maize cells, where they are believed to tighten the cell wall (19Fry S.C. Willis S.C. Paterson A.E.J. Planta. 2000; 211: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and higher oligomers of FA have been implicated during polymerization with horseradish peroxidase under weakly basic conditions (pH 8) (11Rosazza J.P.N. Huang Z. Dostal L. Volm T. Rousseau B. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, their structures were not characterized, leaving much speculation surrounding their formation. Of all the peroxidases LIP should theoretically be able to catalyze the highest degree of FA polymerization, its high redox potential enabling it to further oxidize dimers and oligomers with high IP values. However, this may be dependent on the mechanism of polymerization, because if polymers also arise by attack of FA radicals on preformed dehydrodimers and oligomers, then all peroxidases should be capable of achieving a similar degree of polymerization. This study evaluates the mechanism of oligomer and polymer formation by LIP. In addition, the identification of FA oligomers may prove fruitful, in light of the many potential applications arising for FA and its derivatives in the pharmaceutical and food industries (20Kroon P.A. Williamson G. J. Sci. Food Agric. 1999; 79: 355-361Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar). LIP isoenzyme H1 (LIP-H1) was produced from high nitrogen cultures of P. chrysosporium Burds BKM-F-1767 as described previously (21Rothschild N. Hadar Y. Dosoretz C.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 857-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was purified in two steps by MonoQ HPLC, first using a 0.01–1 m sodium acetate gradient at pH 6.0 (22Kirk T.K. Croan A. Tien M. Murtagh K.E. Farrell R.L. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1986; 8: 27-32Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and then by employing a similar gradient at pH 4.7, equivalent to the pI value of H1. The purified enzyme had an Reinheitszahl (A 409/280) value > 4.0. LIP concentration was determined at 409 nm using an extinction coefficient of 169 mm−1 cm−1 (23Tien M. Kirk T.K. Bull C. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1687-1693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LIP activity (units/liter) was assayed according to Tien and Kirk (24Tien M. Kirk T.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 161: 238-249Crossref Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of the stock enzyme solution was calculated to be 1.96 units/nmol heme protein. The enzyme was extensively dialyzed against double-distilled water before use. For analytical HPLC, oxidation of 300 μm FA was performed with 1 μm LIP-H1 in 50 mm sodium tartrate buffer, pH 3.5, and varying concentrations of H2O2 in a total reaction volume of 1 ml. To prevent H2O2-dependent enzyme inactivation, H2O2 was added stepwise in aliquots of 100 μm min−1. 30 min after addition of H2O2, reactions were either frozen at −70 °C and then freeze-dried or extracted with three volumes of ethyl acetate and evaporated to dryness. The dried reaction mixtures were then redissolved in 300 μl of tetrahydrofuran for gel permeation analysis or 300 μl of 50% (v/v) aqueous methanol for reverse-phase analysis. For fractionation of the oxidation products, the reaction was carried out on a larger scale. A total of 200 ml of 4 mm FA was oxidized by 2 μm LIP and a total of 4 mmH2O2, which was added in aliquots of 200 μm at 1-min intervals. 30 min after addition of the last aliquot of H2O2, reaction products were extracted with three volumes of ethyl acetate, evaporated to dryness, and redissolved in a small amount of 50% (v/v) aqueous methanol before fractionation. HPLC analysis and fractionation were conducted using a Hewlett Packard HPLC (HP1100 series) equipped with a diode array detector. All solvents were of far UV quality HPLC grade purity where available. Gel permeation analysis was performed using a TSK gel G3000 HR column (7.8 mm × 30 cm; particle size, 5 μm; TosoHaas, Stuttgart, Germany). TSK polystyrene standards with molecular weights of 300, 500, 1000, 2500, and 5000 were employed (TOSOH Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Elution was performed using tetrahydrofuran as the mobile phase. The flow rate was maintained at 0.5 ml min−1. Reverse-phase analysis was conducted using a Lichrospher 100 RP-C18 column (25 cm × 5 mm inner diameter; 5 μm; Merck). Elution was performed using a gradient system adapted from a previously described method (14Waldron K.W. Parr A.J. Ng A. Ralph J. Phytochem. Anal. 1996; 7: 305-312Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar), which increased the relative amounts of methanol and acetonitrile present in aqueous 1 mm trifluoroacetic acid. The gradient profile consisted of solvent A (10%, v/v, aqueous acetonitrile plus trifluoroacetic acid to 1 mm), solvent B (80%, v/v, aqueous methanol plus trifluoroacetic acid to 1 mm), and solvent C (80%, v/v, aqueous acetonitrile plus trifluoroacetic acid to 1 mm) in the following program: initially, 90% A, 5% B, and 5% C; linear gradient over 25 min to 26% A, 37% B, and 37% C; linear gradient over 5 min to 0% A, 50% B, and 50% C; linear gradient over 15 min to 90% A, 5% B, and 5% C; and held isocratically at 90% A, 5% B, and 5% C for a further 10 min. The flow rate was maintained at 1 ml min−1. Oxidation products were fractionated using a semi-preparative reverse-phase Lichrospher 100 RP-18 column (25 cm × 10 mm inner diameter; 10 μm; Lichrocart) employing the previously described gradient system. A flow rate of 6 ml min−1 ensured an elution profile similar to that of the analytical column. Oxidation products were collected using a fraction collector (Gilson model 203) and fractions deemed pure by reanalysis were freeze-dried and stored under nitrogen gas in a cool, dark place. Dried products were silylated in 200 μl of dioxane with 200 μl of N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl)-acetamide for 30 min at 60 °C. Trimethylsilylated derivatives were separated using a 0.25 mm × 30 m HP5 Phe Me Silicone column on a Hewlett Packard 5972 series gas chromatograph with helium as the carrier gas and detected with a Hewlett Packard 5972 mass selective detector. The column was ramped at 10 °C min−1 from 150 °C to 300 °C and held for 20 min. The injector and detector were set at 300 °C. 13C and 1H NMR experiments were performed using a Bruker “Avance” DRX-400 instrument, operating at a frequency of 400.13 MHz for 1H observation. The spectrometer was equipped with a 5-mm Bruker inverse multinuclear resonance probe with a single-axis (z) gradient coil. Spectra were measured at room temperature in CD3OD. Chemical shifts (ppm) were given on the δ scale; 1H NMR spectra were referenced to internal tetramethylsilane, and13C NMR spectra were referenced to the solvent. One-dimensional NOE difference experiments were acquired nonspinning in blocks of 40 on- and 40 off-resonance scans with a presaturation time of 2.5 s in an interleaved manner. Two-dimensional gradient-enhanced heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectra were acquired with a 17:20:25 gradient ratio (duration 1 ms), 1024–2048 points in F2, 128–256 complex increments in F1, four to eight scans per increment. Apodization was with a π/2-shifted square sine bell in both dimensions. Gradient-enhanced heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation spectra were obtained with a 50:30:40.1 gradient ratio (duration 2 ms), 1024–2048 points in F2, 128–256 complex increments in F1, and 40-scans per increment. The long range delay was optimized to 60 ms. Spectra were obtained in magnitude mode and transformed with a sine bell weighting function in both dimensions. The semi-empirical AM1 quantum chemical method was used for calculating the optimal geometries and relative energies of the ferulic acid trimers and their free radical precursors. All the calculations were performed with the Gaussian 94 (25Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Gill P.M.W. Johnson B.G. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Keith T. Petersson G.A. Montgomery J.A.

The concentration of stock solutions of H2O2 was determined at 240 nm using an extinction coefficient of 39.4 m−1cm−1. Stock solutions of FA were prepared in 95% ethanol and checked using a calculated extinction coefficient of 14,700m−1 cm−1 at 320 nm. Generation of phenoxy radicals from FA by peroxidases can theoretically lead to a plethora of polymerization products (11Rosazza J.P.N. Huang Z. Dostal L. Volm T. Rousseau B. J. Ind.

To get an indication of the extent of polymerization by LIP, gel permeation chromatography was performed on reactions that had been frozen at −70 °C after 30 min, freeze-dried, and redissolved in tetrahydrofuran (Fig. 1). The oxidation of FA (molecular weight, 194) by LIP-H1 as a function of the obligatory co-factor H2O2 led to the formation of peaks of molecular weight corresponding to dehydrodimers (molecular weight, 386) and trimers (molecular weight, 579). Increasing H2O2 concentration, which was added stepwise in aliquots of 100 μm min−1 to prevent H2O2-dependent enzyme inactivation, resulted in a decrease in the peak corresponding to FA, followed by an increase in the peaks corresponding to dehydrodimers and trimers. Increasing H2O2 concentration above 100 μm resulted in a decrease in the intensity of the peak corresponding to dehydrodimers. Because identical profiles were obtained when the same mixtures were left to react for 24 h before freezing, the limiting factors in the polymerization reaction were H2O2, IP values of the intermediate products, and, probably, enzyme stability. When the same reaction mixtures were subjected to reverse-phase HPLC, numerous peaks were obtained corresponding to oxidation products. A typical chromatogram obtained from large scale oxidation of FA is shown (Fig. 2). Although numerous peaks were obtained, only the major ones, labeled I–IV, were purified and identified. To characterize the major products, the reaction of LIP with FA was carried out on a larger scale and the peaks of interest were fractionated. The structures of the peaks labeled I–IV in Fig. 2 were primarily determined by1H NMR, 13C NMR, COSY, one- and two-dimensional NOE experiments. GC-MS was also employed. 1H NMR spectroscopy indicated that peak I in Fig. 2 corresponds to a product of FA dehydrodimerization, consisting of two nonequivalent tri-substituted aromatic fragments, A and B, one tri-substituted double bond, a saturated fragment, and two methoxy groups. The protons of ring A were characterized by chemical shifts and hyperfine structural patterns similar to those of the parent FA: δH(A5) = 7.40, d(J(A2,A6) = 2.0Hz); δH(A5) = 6.84, d(J(A5,A6) = 8.0Hz); δH(A6) = 7.18, dd(J(A2,A6) = 2.0Hz, J(A5,A6) = 8.0Hz). The protons of ring B were shifted to the strong field: δH(B2) = 6.92, broad s; δH(B5, 6) = 6.78, broad s. The tri-substituted double bond was connected to ring A because the two-dimensional NOE experiment showed that the only vinylic proton (δH(Aα) = 7.54, d(J(Aα, Bβ) = 2.1Hz)) is located near the A6 proton. According to the same two-dimensional NOE experiment, the methoxy group with δH(OCH3) = 3.92 belongs to ring A, and the methoxy group with δH(OCH3) = 3.87 to ring B. Two nonequivalent protons were found in the saturated fragment of the molecule. The first proton, (δH(Bβ) = 4.56), was characterized by weak hyperfine interaction with two protons, Aα and Bα: dd(J(Aα, Bβ) = 2.1Hz, J(Bα, Bβ) = 2.8Hz). The peak of the second proton (δH(Bα) = 5.64) was split by interaction with the Bβ proton: J(Bα, Bβ) = 2.8Hz. The chemical shifts and hyperfine structures of these two peaks suggest that the saturated part consists of two CH fragments. One of them is bound to the Aβ carbon atom of the tri-substituted double bond and probably also to a CO2 group, and the second to aromatic ring B and an oxygen atom. All of the aforementioned results led us to the conclusion that the first isolated product of FA dehydrodimerization has the structure1a (Fig. 3). It belongs to the group of so-called β-β′-dehydrodimerization products also comprising 1b, 1c and 1d. The structure of 1a was also confirmed by comparison of its NMR parameters with data previously published for this compound (12Ralph J. Quideau S. Grabber J.H. Hatfield R.D. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1994; 1: 3485-3498Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The primarily formed β-β′-dehydrodimer 1b may undergo an intramolecular Michael addition of a carboxylic group from one of the two FA moieties to the double bond of the second, leading to1a or 1c (Fig. 3). Compound 1c was identified as one of the major components of peak III, as will be seen further on. GC-MS analysis of peak I after silylation indicated the formation of two isomeric tetrakis(trimethylsilylated) β-β′-dehydrodimers of FA (M+ = 674) (probably of1b and 1d; Fig. 3 and Ref. 12Ralph J. Quideau S. Grabber J.H. Hatfield R.D. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1994; 1: 3485-3498Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The expected tris(trimethylsilylated) product of furanone 1a(M+ = 602) was not obtained, probably because of fast disclosure of the lactone ring under the silylation conditions (12Ralph J. Quideau S. Grabber J.H. Hatfield R.D. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1994; 1: 3485-3498Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Peak II in Fig. 2 is also a product of FA dehydrodimerization. This compound consists of one tri-substituted aromatic fragment A, one tetra-substituted aromatic fragment B, one di-substituted double bond, a saturated fragment, two carboxylic groups and two methoxy groups. The protons of ring A were characterized by the following chemical shifts and hyperfine structural patterns: δH(A2) = 6.95, d(J(A2,A6) = 1.8Hz); δH(A5) = 6.78, d(J(A5,A6) = 8.2Hz); δH(A6) = 6.83, dd(J(A2,A6) = 1.8Hz, J(A5,A6) = 8.2Hz). The protons of ring B were shifted to the low field: δH(B2) = 7.17, broad singlet; δH(B6) = 7.23, broad singlet. According to the results of the two-dimensional NOE experiment, the methoxy group with δH(OCH3) = 3.81 belongs to ring A, and the methoxy group with δH(OCH3) = 3.91 to ring B. The di-substituted double bond is connected to ring B. The following chemical shifts and hyperfine interaction patterns were found for the α- and β-vinylic protons: δH(Bα) = 7.62, d(J(Bα, Bβ) = 15.9Hz); δH(Bβ) = 7.62, d(J(Bα, Bβ) = 15.9Hz). The saturated part of the molecule consists of two CH fragments. One of them is bound to the aromatic ring A and an oxygen atom (δC(Aα) = 89.21), and the second to the aromatic ring B(δC(Aβ) = 57.08). The proton of the CH group connected to ring A was characterized by a chemical shift δH(Aα) = 6.02 and by relatively strong hyperfine interactions with proton Aβ (d(J(Aα, Aβ) = 7.7Hz) of the second CH (δH(Aβ) = 4.27) group bound to ring B. Results of the two-dimensional NOE experiment confirmed the assignment: proton Aα is located near protons A2 and A6; proton Aβ is close to B2 and B6. The NMR data led us to conclude that the second isolated product of FA dehydrodimerization, peak II, has the structure 2a (Fig. 4). It belongs to the group of β-5′-dehydrodimers along with structure2b in Fig. 4. The primarily formed β-5′-dehydrodimer2b may undergo intramolecular addition of the phenolic hydroxyl group from ring B to the double bond connected to the B5 carbon atom leading to 2a (Fig. 4). GC-MS analysis of peak II after silylation indicated the presence of three different compounds with molecular masses of 674, 602 (the major component), and 558 (the minor component). These three compounds may be assigned as follows: the 602 peak to the tris(trimethylsilylated) derivative of 2a; the 674 peak to the tetra(trimethylsilylated) derivative of 2b (the possibility of partial disclosure of the furanoid ring in 2aduring the silylation procedure has been reported; Ref. 12Ralph J. Quideau S. Grabber J.H. Hatfield R.D. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1994; 1: 3485-3498Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar), and the 558 peak to the tris(trimethylsilylated) derivative of the decarboxylation product of 2b (see structure 2cand Ref. 12Ralph J. Quideau S. Grabber J.H. Hatfield R.D. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1994; 1: 3485-3498Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Peak III in Fig. 2 consisted of two major components. One of them is a symmetric dehydrodimer of FA, consisting of two equivalent tri-substituted aromatic rings and two equivalent saturated parts. The aromatic protons were characterized by the following chemical shifts: δH(A2) = δH(B2) = 6.96, δH(A5) = δH(B5) = 6.863, δH(A6) = δH(B6) = 6.857. Two pairs of equivalent CH fragments were found in the saturated part of the molecule. According to the chemical shift δH(Aα) = δH(Bα) = 5.80, dd(J(Aα, Aβ) = 1.1Hz, J(Aα, Bβ) = 1.1Hz), one of the two CH fragments is connected to the aromatic moiety and an oxygen atom. The second CH fragment with δH(Aβ) = δH(Bβ) = 3.99, dd(J(Aα, Aβ) = 1.1Hz, J(Aβ, Bα) = 1.1Hz) is connected to a carboxylic group. The results of the one-dimensional NOE experiments (TableI) led us to the conclusion that (i) the α-proton is spatially close to the protons in positions 2 and 6 of the aromatic ring and (ii) the β-proton is located near the proton in position 2. These facts enabled us to assign the dilactone structure1c to the dehydrodimer found in peak III.Table INOE of the dimer with structure 1cIrradiated atomAtoms with enhanced intensityα2, 6, ββ2, 6, αH(OCH3)25, 6α, β2α, β, OCH3 Open table in a new tab GC-MS analysis of peak III after silylation indicated the formation of four major components: two having a molecular mass of 674, similar to those found for peak I, one with a molecular mass of 602 (probably the tris(trimethylsilylated) product of lactone1a), and the last with a molecular mass of 530 which fits well with bis(trimethylsilylated) dilactone 1c. The second major component in peak III has the structure of a FA trimer. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra led us to believe that there are three different tri-substituted aromatic fragments in the molecule: two double bonds and one saturated fragment. The δC, δH, and splitting pattern are presented in Tables II andIII. The assignment of the signals in1H and 13C NMR spectra is based on the analysis of the splitting pattern, COSY spectra, and13C-1H correlation spectra. The data presented in Tables II and III, along with the results of the one-dimensional NOE experiment (Table IV), led us to conclude that: (i) the double bond with the chemical shift of the vinylic proton δH = 6.37 is connected to ring C, because this proton is located near proton C2; (ii) the double bond with the chemical shift of the vinylic proton δH = 6.33 is connected to ring A, because this proton is spatially close to proton A2; (iii) aromatic fragments A and C are connected to the CH group of the saturated part with δH = 6.01, because this proton is located near both protons A5 and C5; (iv) the aromatic fragments A and C are connected to the aforementioned CH group through the phenolic oxygen atoms, because the chemical shift of the corresponding carbon atom δC = 106.29 is characteristic of the acetal carbon (26Kalinowski H.-O. Berger S. Braun S. Carbon-13 NMR Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Chichester, UK1988Google Scholar); (v) the second CH group (δH = 4.95) is connected to aromatic fragment B, because the corresponding proton is located near protons B2 and B6; and (vi) the second CH group is also connected to an oxygen atom, because the chemical shift of the corresponding carbon atom, (δC = 75.80) resembles those of alcohol carbons (26Kalinowski H.-O.

During these processes, the viral core, consisting of viral RNA and core proteins, becomes wrapped in a membranous structure (viral envelope) derived from host cell membranes to form virion particles. The assembly process, which is referred to as budding, usually occurs at either the plasma or intracellular membranes. The formation of viral core, envelope, and the assembly of virus particles would involve interaction between viral proteins and host membrane components, among viral structural proteins and between viral proteins and viral RNA. Characterization of these events at the molecular level has been greatly facilitated by the understanding that viral structural proteins may contain all of the necessary information to dictate the assembly process. In fact, it was observed that coexpression of viral structural proteins would result in the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs)1 in many different viral systems (1Brautigam S. Snezhkov E.

In this study, we exploit the coronavirus VLP system to study the interaction between two structural proteins during coronavirus assembly and the implication of this interaction in the assembly and release of coronavirus particles. Coronavirus is the largest RNA virus known so far. It has a positive-sense, single-strand RNA genome of 27–30 kilobases in length. Despite of the huge genome size, coronavirus typically contains four structural proteins, i.e. a type I spike (S) glycoprotein required for infectivity, a phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein that interacts with the viral genome to form a helical core, a major type III integral membrane (M) protein, and a minor type III envelope (E) protein (10Holmes K.V.

A fifth protein, the hemagglutinin esterase glycoprotein (HE) is found in some but not all coronaviruses as short spikes (16Dea S. Tijssen P. Arch. Virol. 1988; 99: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Extensive cellular studies on porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) have demonstrated that coronaviruses assemble at the pre-Golgi membranes of the intermediate compartment (IC) early in infection and in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at late times of the infection (17Risco C.

Avian Pathol. 1996; 25: 675-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Unlike most other enveloped RNA viruses, coronaviruses employ a nucleocapsid-independent strategy to drive assembly and budding (2Vennema H. Godeke G.-J. Rossen J.W.A. Voorhout W.F. Horzinek M.C. Opstelten D.-J., E. Rottier P.J.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2020-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Coexpression of both M and E in intact cells was initially shown to be required for inducing the formation of VLPs, which are similar in size and appearance as the authentic MHV virions (2Vennema H. Godeke G.-J. Rossen J.W.A. Voorhout W.F. Horzinek M.C. Opstelten D.-J., E. Rottier P.J.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2020-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that expression of E alone resulted in the release of E-containing vesicles (15Corse E. Machamer C.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4319-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 21Maeda J. Maeda A. Makino S. Virology. 1999; 263: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These particles were referred to as VLPs (15Corse E. Machamer C.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4319-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The crucial role of E in viral assembly was also indicated by other studies on MHV and TGEV (23Fischer F. Stegen C.F. Masters P.S. Samsonoff W.A. J.

Previously, E was shown to be an integral membrane protein (22Raamsman M.J.B. Locker J.K. de Hooge A. de Vries A.A.F. Griffiths G. Vennema H. Rottier P.J.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 15Corse E. Machamer C.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4319-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It expresses on the surface of the infected cell (25Smith A.R. Boursnell M.E.G. Binns M.M. Brown T.D.K. Inglis S.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), in the ER and the IC compartment (22Raamsman M.J.B. Locker J.K. de Hooge A. de Vries A.A.F. Griffiths G. Vennema H. Rottier P.J.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and in the Golgi complex (15Corse E. Machamer C.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4319-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In this study, the subcellular localization and the intracellular translocation of IBV E were studied in detail in intact cells by using specific organelle markers. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that the protein resided temporarily in the pre-Golgi compartments consisting of the ER and IC membranes for up to 7 h post-transfection, before it progressed down the secretory pathway. The signal that determines the temporal retention of E in the pre-Golgi compartments was mapped to the C-terminal extreme 6-residue RDKLYS, which may resemble the well characterized di-lysine ER targeting motif for membrane proteins. Interestingly, coexpression of E with IBV M, a typical Golgi-localizing protein, showed temporal retention of M in the pre-Golgi compartments. In fact, M was shown to be colocalized and cotranslocated to the same subcellular compartments when coexpressed with E in a time course experiment, suggesting a strong physical interaction between the two proteins. Coimmunoprecipitation and deletion analysis revealed that the two proteins could indeed form a heterogeneous complex and that a putative peripheral domain was required for the interaction with M. Deletion of this domain significantly reduced the assembly of M into VLPs. Furthermore, the membrane anchorage of E was demonstrated to be contributed by a stretch of hydrophobic residues at the N-terminal region of the protein and to be essential for the formation of VLP, because deletion of this putative transmembrane domain resulted in the relocation of the mutant protein to the cytosol and led to a drastic reduction in the release of VLPs. This study reveals that IBV E protein plays a fundamental role in the assembly of viral particles. The egg-adapted Beaudette strain of IBV (VR-22) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and was adapted to Vero cells as described previously (26Liu D.X. Shen S. Xu H.Y. Wang S.F. Virology. 1998; 246: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Vero cells and Cos-7 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and maintained in Glasgow's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. IBV sequences were placed under the control of a T7 promoter and transiently expressed in mammalian cells using the system described by Fuerst et al.(27Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). Briefly, 60–80% confluent monolayers of Cos-7 cells grown on 35-mm dishes (Falcon) were infected with 10 plaque-forming units/cell of a recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7–3) that expresses bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. The cells were then transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA (purified by Qiagen plasmid Midi kits) mixed with Lipofectin transfection reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). After incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5 h, the cells were washed twice with methionine-free medium and labeled with 25 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. The radiolabeled cells and culture media were then harvested at 18 h post-transfection. Electrophoresis of viral polypeptides was performed on SDS-17.5% polyacrylamide gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The 35S-labeled polypeptides were detected by autoradiography of the dried gels. Complementary DNA templates for PCR were prepared from purified IBV virion RNA by using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Amplification of the respective template DNAs with appropriate primers was performed with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) under the standard buffer conditions with 2 mm MgCl2. The reaction conditions used were 30 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, X °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for X min. The annealing temperature (55 °C) and the extension time (4 min) were subjected to adjustments according to the melting temperature of the primers employed and the length of PCR fragments synthesized. Media of transfected Cos-7 cells were collected and mixed with 5× RIPA buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% SDS) and precleared by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Cells were lysed with 1× RIPA buffer and precleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. Immunoprecipitation with anti-E and anti-M rabbit polyclonal antisera (14Liu D.X. Inglis S.C. Virology. 1991; 185: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29Ng L.F.P. Liu D.X. Virology. 2000; 272: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and anti-T7 monoclonal antiserum (Novagen) was carried out as previously described (30Liu D.X. Cavanagh D. Green P. Inglis S.C. Virology. 1991; 184: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). IBV sequences were transiently expressed in Cos-7 cells grown on 4-well chamber slides (IWAKI). At 5 h post-transfection (or otherwise stated), cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to fixation using 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Fluorescence staining was performed by incubating cells with either an antibody or a mixture of both primary antibodies (rabbit anti-M (1:30) or mouse anti-T7 (1:200)) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by FITC- or tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Goat anti-rabbit antibody was used at 1:400 (Sigma) and goat anti-mouse IgG at 1:20 (DAKO). Images were viewed and collected with a Zeiss confocal microscope connected to a Bio-Rad MRC1024 laser scanner. Plasmid pIBVM-1, which covers the IBV sequence between nucleotides 24498 and 25159, was constructed by cloning a PvuII/SacI-digested PCR fragment intoPvuII/SacI digested pKTO vector (31Liu D.X. Brierley I. Tibbles K.W. Brown T.D.K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5772-5780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR fragment was generated using primers LDX59 (5′-CAGCAACAGCTGAAGATGCCCAACG-3′) and LDX60 (5′-CTACACACGAGCTCTTATGTGTAAAGA-3′). Plasmid pIBVE was constructed as follows. A 735-base pair fragment, obtained by PCR using LDX55 (5′-GATTGTTCAGGCCATGGTGAATTTATTGAA-3′) and XIANG8 (5′-GCACCATTGGCACACTC-3′), was digested with NcoI andBamHI and ligated intoNcoI/BamHI-digested pKTO, resulting in a plasmid containing the IBV sequence between nucleotides 24205 and 24795. Plasmid pT7E was constructed by fusing the 11-amino acid T7 tag (MASMTGGQQMG) to the N terminus of E. In a previous study using immunoaffinity-purified antibodies specific for IBV E, the protein was demonstrated to be localized to intracellular membrane structures as well as on cell surface in IBV-infected cells (25Smith A.R. Boursnell M.E.G. Binns M.M. Brown T.D.K. Inglis S.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although some evidence of polarization of the fluorescence into structures resembling the Golgi apparatus was observed, the reticular staining patterns suggest that the majority of the protein may be localized to pre-Golgi compartments at the time of observation (25Smith A.R. Boursnell M.E.G. Binns M.M. Brown T.D.K. Inglis S.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). More recently, Raamsman et al. (22Raamsman M.J.B. Locker J.K. de Hooge A. de Vries A.A.F. Griffiths G. Vennema H. Rottier P.J.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) reported that E colocalizes with Rab-1, a marker for the IC and the ER, supporting that the protein may be localized to the pre-Golgi compartments. However, Corse and Machamer (15Corse E. Machamer C.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4319-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) have recently presented data showing that IBV E may be colocalized with M to the Golgi apparatus. To address this issue further, IBV E was fused to an 11-amino acid T7 Tag (Novagen), and a highly specific monoclonal antibody against the T7 tag was used to study the subcellular distribution of E in intact cells. This strategy would also facilitate dual labeling of cells expressing both M and E in subsequent studies. Subcellular localization of E in Cos-7 cells was examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. A reticular staining pattern (Fig.1 A) colocalizes with the staining profile of R6 (rhodamine B hexyl-ester chloride, Molecular Probes) (Fig. 1 B), a short chain carbocyanine dye known to stain specifically the ER of mammalian cells, as indicated by the merged image (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, IBV M, which was previously shown to be localized to the Golgi apparatus (32Machamer C.E. Mentone S.A. Rose J.K. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6944-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), does not colocalize with the R6 marker (Fig. 1, D–F); instead, it coaligns with the staining pattern of the fluorescence vital dye BODIPY TR-ceramide (Molecular Probes) (Fig. 1, G–I). This dye was shown to stain the Golgi apparatus specifically (Molecular Probes). To further clarify the subcellular distribution pattern of E, transfected cells were incubated in the presence of 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide for 30 min at 3.5 h post-transfection to stop new protein synthesis. The expressed viral proteins were then chased and fixed at 4, 7, 10, and 16 h post-transfection, respectively, and the subcellular localization patterns were viewed by indirect immunofluorescent staining. E was observed to display the reticular staining profiles overlapping with the R6 staining patterns up to 7 h post-transfection (Fig. 2,A–F). A more perinuclear staining pattern was observed at 10 h post-transfection (Fig. 2 G). It overlaps with the staining pattern of the fluorescence vital dye BODIPY TR-ceramide (Fig.2, G–I). Granular fluorescent aggregates scattering in the cytoplasm of the transfected cells were observed at 16 h post-transfection (Fig. 2 J). This fluorescence pattern overlaps with the staining pattern of LysoTrackerTM Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes), a biotinylated acidotropic probe that stains acidic compartments including lysosomes, trans-Golgi vesicles, and secretory vesicles. The amino acid sequence of E was then subjected to computer analysis using the PSORT program for prediction of subcellular localization signals (33Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar) and the TMPRED proteomics tools for prediction of transmembrane regions and membrane topology of proteins (34Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 a, a putative transmembrane domain is predicted for residues between 17 and 33, a putative peripheral domain is located between amino acids 37 to 53, and a potential ER retention signal is predicted to be present at the C-terminal extreme end of the protein. To determine the effects of each putative domain on the subcellular distribution of E, several deletion constructs were constructed. EΔ1 deletes the N-terminal sequence from amino acids 1 to 14, EΔ2 deletes the putative transmembrane domain (residues 18–33), EΔ3 contains a deletion of residues 33–51 in the putative peripheral membrane domain, EΔ4 deletes amino acids 50–64, EΔ5 deletes amino acids 67–83, and EΔ6 deletes 26 residues from the C-terminal end (thus removing the potential ER retention signal) (Fig. 3 b). The effects of each deletion on the subcellular distribution of E are summarized in Fig. 3 b. As shown in Fig. 4, the two deletions that resulted in an altered subcellular distribution profile of E are EΔ2 and EΔ6. Deletion of the putative transmembrane domain (EΔ2) resulted in a diffuse staining pattern (Fig. 4 G), which does not overlap with the staining pattern of R6 (Fig. 4, H and I). Deletion of the C-terminal 26 residues led to the detection of the mutant protein with a staining profile similar to that of M (Fig. 4, S–U). This result indicates that the C-terminal region of E may contain sufficient information for its ER retention. Other deletion constructs including deletion of ∼95% of the putative peripheral domain of E rendered no obvious effects on the subcellular localization of E (Fig. 4). Further deletion of the C-terminal most six amino acids was carried out, giving rise to EΔ8. Similar to EΔ6, expression of EΔ8 showed that the protein exhibits a Golgi-like staining profile (Fig. 5 A), which does not overlap with the R6 staining pattern (Fig. 5, B andC). Instead, it overlaps with the staining pattern of dye BODIPY TR-ceramide (Fig. 5, D–F), indicating that the mutant protein may be localized to the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, when the −4 lysine residue was mutated to a nonconservative glutamine, the mutant protein accumulates at the Golgi apparatus, as it colocalizes with the staining pattern of dye BODIPY TR-ceramide (Fig.5, G and I). Because E has been shown to be the sole component for VLP production (15Corse E. Machamer C.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4319-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), it was speculated that incorporation of other viral structural proteins into VLPs would involve the interaction between E and those proteins. In fact, Maedaet al. (21Maeda J. Maeda A. Makino S. Virology. 1999; 263: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated that anti-E antibody is able to coimmunoprecipitate structural proteins E, M, and N in MHV-infected cells, indicating the interactions of E with other structural proteins. Because M was also shown to be an essential component for VLP formation, we tested the interaction between E and M by coexpressing them in Cos-7 cells. Fig. 6 refers to coimmunoprecipitation of cells expressing both proteins. Fig.6 a shows that M alone cannot be precipitated by anti-T7 antiserum (lane 6). In the presence of E (lane 4), a protein species corresponding to the pre-Golgi form of M was precipitated (lane 5). This form of M is likely to be a mixture of unglycosylated and pre-Golgi modified M and was referred to as pre-Golgi form of M in this report. Similarly, E cannot be immunoprecipitated by anti-M when expressed alone (lane 1). However, when M was coexpressed, E could be precipitated by anti-M (lane 2). Similar forms of the physical interaction between E and M were observed in IBV-infected Vero cells. As shown in Fig.6 b, E and both pre- and post-Golgi forms of M were coimmunoprecipitated by anti-M (lane 1) and anti-E (lane 5) antisera, respectively, in cell lysates prepared from IBV-infected Vero cells harvested at 18 h post-infection. Coimmunoprecipitation of both proteins were also observed from the viral particles released into the culture medium (lanes 2and 6). To view this form of interaction in intact cells, M and E proteins were coexpressed in Cos-7 cells. At 3.5 h post-transfection, new protein synthesis was stopped by incubation of the cells in the presence of 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide for 30 min. The expressed viral proteins were then chased and fixed at 4, 7, 10, and 16 h post-transfection, respectively, and were viewed by immunofluorescent staining. Representative cells are shown in Fig.7. E was observed to show a reticular staining pattern similar to that in Figs. 1 A and2 D up to 7 h post-transfection (Fig. 7, Aand D). At 10 and 16 h post-transfection, the protein accumulates in the Golgi apparatus and the secretory vesicles, respectively (Fig. 7, G–J), as shown in Fig. 2(G and J). Interestingly, dual labeling of M in cells coexpressing both E and M showed that M colocalizes with E to the ER up to 7 h post-transfection (Fig. 7, A–F). M was then translocated with E to the Golgi apparatus and the secretory vesicles at 10 and 16 h post-transfection, respectively (Fig. 7,G–L). These results suggest that interaction of E with M may occur in intact cells, because E can retain and translocate M to the compartments it resides in. The detection of both E and M in the ER, the Golgi and the secretory vesicles may represent the route that M-E protein complexes take to exit the host cells. To further confirm this observation, M was coexpressed with EΔ2 and EΔ7, respectively, and the cells were stained at 7 h post-transfection. EΔ7 contains a deletion of residues 37–57, the putative peripheral domain. Once again, EΔ2 exhibits a diffuse staining pattern (Fig. 7 M). Instead of the typical Golgi localization profile (Fig. 1 D), coexpression of EΔ2 with M forces M to adapt the same diffuse staining pattern of EΔ2 (Fig. 7,M–O). Coexpression of EΔ7 and M showed a reticular staining pattern of EΔ7 (Fig. 7 P), similar to the staining pattern of EΔ3, which contains a deletion considerably overlapping with that in EΔ7 (Fig. 4 J). However, the staining pattern of M did not overlap with that of EΔ7 (Fig. 7, P–R). As can be seen, the majority of M was accumulated in the Golgi region, with a faint reticular staining (Fig. 7 Q). The subcellular distribution patterns of E and M in IBV-infected cells were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence with polyclonal antisera against E and M, respectively. At 4.5 h post-infection, Vero cells were incubated in the presence of 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide for 30 min to stop new protein synthesis and were chased and fixed at 5, 7, 9, and 12 h post-infection, respectively. Both E and M were observed to display the reticular staining profiles overlapping with the R6 staining patterns up to 7 h post-infection (Fig. 8,A–F and M–R). E and M proteins were then observed to accumulate at the perinuclear region at 10 h post-infection (Fig. 8, G and S), overlapping with the staining pattern of the fluorescence vital dye BODIPY TR-ceramide (Fig. 8, G–I and S–U). Granular fluorescent aggregates of both E and M were detected in the cytoplasm at 12 h post-infection (Fig. 8, J and V), overlapping with the staining pattern of LysoTrackerTM Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes) (Fig. 8, J–L andV–X). These distribution patterns resemble the staining patterns observed in cells coexpressing the T7-tagged E and M, suggesting that the T7 tag does not obviously affect the subcellular distribution patterns of E. However, we were unable to dual label the same cells for detailed analysis of the distribution profiles of the two proteins, because both anti-E and anti-M were raised in rabbits. To determine the domain(s) required for the interaction with M, immunoprecipitation of lysates prepared from cells coexpressing M and an E deletion mutant was performed. Most mutants can be coimmunoprecipitated with M, except for EΔ3 and EΔ7 (Fig.9). As shown in Fig. 9, only trace amounts of EΔ3 and EΔ7 were coimmunoprecipitated by anti-M (lanes 4 and 15), and no M was coimmunoprecipitated by anti-T7 (lanes 11 and16). Taken together with the colocalization data present in Fig. 7P-R, these results suggest that the predicted peripheral domain (amino acids 37–57) may be responsible for the interaction of E with M. The effects of deletion of E on the release of VLPs were tested by expression of E and the deletion constructs in Cos-7 cells and by detection of the expressed proteins in the culture medium. As shown in Fig.10 a, the wild type and deletion constructs EΔ2 and EΔ7 were efficiently detected in lysates prepared from cells transfected with the corresponding constructs (lanes 6–8). The wild type and EΔ7 were also efficiently detected from the culture media by immunoprecipitation with anti-T7 antibody (Fig. 10 a, lanes 14 and16), indicating that VLPs were efficiently released from cells expressing the two constructs. Because EΔ7 contains a deletion of the putative peripheral domain of E, this result implies that this putative domain may be not essential for the release of VLPs. Interestingly, no release of VLPs was observed from cells transfected with EΔ2 (Fig. 10 a, lane 15), suggesting that the transmembrane domain may be essential for the release of VLPs. Because deletion of the putative transmembrane domain resulted in the detection of E in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 G), these results demonstrate that insertion of E into the intracellular membrane structures is essential for the release of VLPs. As a control experiment, M was detected in transfected cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-M (Fig. 10 a, lane 1); however, it was undetectable in the culture media (Fig. 10 a, lane 2). The effects of other deletions on the release of VLPs are summarized in Fig. 3 b. We next tested the effects of the deletions of the putative transmembrane domain and the peripheral domai"

This mutated receptor binds estradiol with wild type affinity and displays transcriptional activity upon estradiol stimulation, but with limited potency (about 50%). This partial activity is efficiently repressed in antagonist competition assays. The comparison with available LBD structures reveals key features governing the positioning of helix H12 and highlights the importance of cysteine residues in promoting an active conformation. Furthermore the present study reveals a hydrogen bond network connecting ligand binding to protein trans conformation. These observations support a dynamic view of H12 positioning, where the control of the equilibrium between two stable locations determines the partial agonist character of a given ligand.1QKT The crystal structure of a triple cysteine to serine mutant ERα ligand-binding domain (LBD), complexed with estradiol, shows that despite the presence of a tightly bound agonist ligand, the protein exhibits an antagonist-like conformation, similar to that observed in raloxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen-bound structures.

All members of this family display a modular structure composed of six domains (A–F). The E region constitutes the ligand-binding domain (LBD)1 containing a ligand-dependant transactivation function (AF-2) (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

Biol. 1996; 3: 529-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors is mediated by interactions with the transcriptional machinery through various corepressors and coactivators (3McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). Their ability to modulate gene expression in a ligand-regulated manner is based on the position of helix H12 carrying the AF2-AD transactivation function (4Ruff M. Gangloff M. Wurtz J.M. Moras D. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Several positions of H12 have been observed (5Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, H12 has been shown to be exposed to solvent (6Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Ligand binding triggers a conformational change that results in the repositioning of H12 on the core of the LBD, closing the ligand binding pocket like a lid (7Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is referred to as the mouse trap mechanism (8Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). In agonist-bound LBDs a surface suitable for coactivator binding is then created (9Darimont B.D.

These observations suggest a mechanism for antagonism where H12 and the coactivator compete for a common binding site. Note that the agonist position of H12 is unique, whereas its position in antagonist-bound complexes is not. Therefore knowledge of the features responsible for inducing and stabilizing a given conformation is a key step in understanding the initial events of nuclear receptor transactivation. Several crystal structures of both ER isotypes (ERα and ERβ) have been solved in complex with natural and synthetic ligands (12Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A.

The natural ligand 17β-estradiol acts as a pure agonist on both isotypes. Others typified by EM-800 and ICI164,384 are described as pure antagonists (17MacGregor J.I. Jordan V.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 151-196PubMed Google Scholar). A third category of ligands displaying cell-type and promoter dependence in ER regulation are referred to as selective ER modulators (SERMs) (18Katzenellenbogen B.S. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). SERMs such as raloxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen efficiently antagonize the AF2, but not the AF1 function, and act as a pure antagonist (19Barkhem T. Carlsson B. Nilsson Y. Enmark E. Gustafsson J. Nilsson S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) in ERβ, which seems to lack a functional AF1 domain (20McInerney E.M. Weis K.E. Sun J. Mosselman S. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The features responsible for inducing a given conformation and stabilizing it are crucial to the definition of the optimal stereochemical and biophysical specificity of a ligand. Here we present the comparison of the wild type hERα LBD crystal structure (16Eiler, S., Gangloff, M., Duclaud, S., Moras, D., and Ruff, M. (2001)Protein Expression Purif., in press.Google Scholar) with that of a mutant protein complexed with estradiol, where three cysteine residues were mutated in serine. The mutant protein binds estradiol with wild type affinity but has limited transcriptional capacity. In the structure of the Cys → Ser triple mutant hERα LBD, we observed an antagonist conformation despite the presence of a tightly bound estradiol in the ligand-binding cavity. This antagonist conformation, together with the transcriptional activity of the single, double, and triple cysteine to serine mutant receptors, supports the view of the agonist-antagonist equilibrium of H12 and gives some insight into the molecular mechanism for the conformational switch that drives the receptor in an agonist or antagonist conformation. The Cys → Ser triple mutant hERα LBD (Lys302 → Pro552), in fusion with six histidine residues is produced using the pET15b/Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) expression system and purified by a zinc affinity column, ion exchange, and gel filtration. The purification procedure is similar to that of the wild type ER LBD (16Eiler, S., Gangloff, M., Duclaud, S., Moras, D., and Ruff, M. (2001)Protein Expression Purif., in press.Google Scholar). Crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion at 4 and 17 °C using hanging drops made by mixing 1 μl of protein solution (2.5 mg/ml) with 1 μl of reservoir solution (12% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.4 m NaCl, 100 mm imidazole, pH = 6.9). Prior to data collection, crystals were flash-cooled in liquid ethane after a fast soaking in a cryoprotectant buffer (20% glycerol, 15% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.4 m NaCl, 100 mm imidazole, pH = 6.9). Crystals belong to the space group P6522 with cell parameters a =b = 58.6 Å, c = 276.02 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120° (one monomer in the asymmetric unit, 45% solvent). X-ray data were collected at 120 K in a nitrogen gas stream using synchrotron radiation (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility Laboratoire pour l'Utilisation du Rayonnement Éléctromagnétique). The diffracted intensities were processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (21Otwinoswski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Experimental phases were obtained using gold and platinum derivatives. The multiple isomorphous replacement analysis was performed using CCP4 (22Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar) for GAL-ER activity are used as reporter plasmids. CMV-βGal served as an internal control to normalize for transfection efficiency. Bluescript KS+ plasmid was used as carrier DNA. The procaryotic expression system pET15b-LBD/BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was used for estradiol binding ability and structural studies of the LBD. The mutations were generated in different constructs to allow structural and functional studies. Cysteine to serine mutations at positions 381, 417, and 530 were introduced in the LBD cloned in NdeI-BamHI sites of pET15b by PCR-assisted mutagenesis, using Deep Vent DNA polymerase (Biolabs) and the appropriate oligonucleotides. Triple mutant Cys → Ser His-tagged LBD was used in the structural studies and ligand binding assays. For transactivation assays the single, double, or triple mutants, in all possible combinations, were brought into the full-length receptor (pSG5-ER26) by digesting the LBD with the restriction enzymes HindIII-BglII. This fragment of 252 base pairs sharing the mutation C381S and/or C417S was inserted in the HindIII-BglII sites of pSG5-ER. The presence of another BglII cleavage site in pSG5 causes the loss of a fragment of 547 base pairs. ThisBglII-BglII fragment with or without the C530S mutation was reinserted in the vector. TheBglII-BglII C530S fragment was obtained by PCR-assisted site-directed mutagenesis. To remove the AF1 contribution, the triple mutant was also brought into theXhoI-BamHI sites of the pG4m vector by PCR cloning using the pSG5-ER triple mutant as template, leading to the eucaryotic expression of GAL-ER(DEF). Based on structural observations, another triple mutant was designed (E339A,E419A,K531A). These mutations were successively generated by PCR mutagenesis in the DEF region (282) subcloned in theXhoI-BamHI sites of pG4m. These mutations were also brought in the LBD subcloned in theNdeI-BamHI sites of pET 15b. All constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. COS1 cells, an estrogen receptor-deficient cell line, were transferred in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal calf serum and antibiotics (40 μg/ml gentamicin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 500 units/ml specillin). Cells were plated in six-well dishes (Costar) at a density of ∼5 × 105 cells/well in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C. The cells were transfected 5–6 h later by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique with 0.2 μg of wild type or mutant receptor plasmid, 2 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of CMV-βGal (internal control plasmid), and 7.3 μg of Bluescript KS+ carrier DNA. These plasmids were mixed in 420 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.05 mm EDTA. 60 μl of 2 m CaCl2 was added by dripping. The mixture was dripped in 2× 480 μl of HBS (280 mmNaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4·12H2O, pH 7.12) and left 30 min at room temperature before being dispersed on the cells. 300 μl were taken per well. The precipitate remained in contact with the cells for 15 h. After this exposure, the cells were washed with phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and antibiotics. Cells were then incubated in culture medium containing the indicated concentrations of estradiol for 24 h. Lysis was achieved in 300 μl/well in 10 mm MOPS, 10 mmNaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 6.5, for 30 min at room temperature. The cellular lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g. The CAT was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The amount of CAT was standardized for transfection efficiency with the β-galactosidase activity in each lysate. The basal level was defined as the CAT activity in cells transfected with the reporter plasmid in the absence of receptor plasmid. Each experiment was performed at least three times in duplicate. Results are expressed in relative CAT activity in percent of maximal wild type receptor activity (Fig. 3). We have used the pET15b-LBD/BL21(DE3) system to produce hERα LBD for ligand binding assays. E. coli BL21(DE3) expressing native or mutant LBD were lysed by sonification in the binding buffer (1 mSB201, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). After centrifugation at 14,000 × g during 1 h at 4 °C, the soluble fraction (crude extract) was used for receptor quantification and dissociation constant (Kd) determination. The total amount of protein in the crude extract was quantified using the Bradford technique. The binding assays were all performed in the presence of a total protein concentration of 5 mg/ml to avoid retention of the receptor in complex with the ligand, thus the crude extract was diluted with soluble proteins from untransformed bacteria. Receptor quantification was achieved in the presence of 10−8m[6,7-3H]estradiol (E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.E. I.) with (for nonspecific binding) or without (for total binding) an excess of cold estradiol (2.10−6m) and increasing amounts of crude extract. After 5 h at 4 °C, bound (B) and free (F) ligands were separated by dextran-coated charcoal (4% Norit A charcoal, 0.4% dextran T-70 in the binding buffer). This mixture was left on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × gfor 5 min. The supernatant was removed for scintillation counting (30Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Couette B. Radanyi C. Lombes M. Baulieu E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9304-9309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific binding was plotted against the volume of crude extract for receptor quantification. For the Kd determination the crude extract was incubated with increasing concentrations (from 10−10 to 10−7m) of radiolabeled estradiol at 4 °C overnight. Each measure was done in triplicate for Scatchard analysis. The variation of B/F as a function of B was analyzed as described previously (31Claire M. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Michaud A. Corvol P. Venot A. Roth-Meyer C. Boisvieux J.F. Mallet A. FEBS Lett. 1978; 88: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The structure of the triple mutant ERα LBD (Fig. 1 b) exhibits the predominantly α-helical fold observed for all nuclear receptors. The superposition over the wild type structure in complex with estradiol (16Eiler, S., Gangloff, M., Duclaud, S., Moras, D., and Ruff, M. (2001)Protein Expression Purif., in press.Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 a) leads to an r.m.s. deviation of 0.54 Å over 211 Cα atoms (H1, H3-H8, H9-H11). The most striking conformational difference between these two structures is the different positioning of helix H12 and the concomitant shortening of helices H3 and H11 (Fig. 1, a and b). In the mutant, the activation helix is in the antagonist position as observed in the raloxifen and tamoxifen complexes (12Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar, 13Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2900) Google Scholar). Both antagonist structures superimpose very well to that of the mutant LBD. The r.m.s. deviation is 0.5 Å over 213 Cα atoms (H1, H3-H8, H9-H11, H12) and 0.5 Å over 238 Cα atoms (H1-H6, H7-H11, H12) for the raloxifen and tamoxifen complexes, respectively (Fig.1 c). The loop L8–9 is not seen in raloxifen, and the structure of the loop L1–3 is closer to the triple mutant in the complex with tamoxifen than that with raloxifen. Wild type and mutant homodimers can be superimposed with a r.m.s. deviation value of 0.64 Å over 418 Cα atoms. The helices H9 and H10 form the core of the interface and contribute to more than 70% of it. Despite this good match, the contributions of the secondary structure elements to the interface, spanning the helices H7 to H11, differ among the two forms. Due to the antagonist conformation of the mutant structure, helices H7, H9, and H10 exhibit a smaller contact surface area (1475 Å2) compared with the wild type (1686 Å2). The overall structure of the pocket is similar in the wild type and the Cys → Ser triple mutant. All side chains of the hydrophobic residues lining the pocket are at the same position. This explains the fact that the dissociation constants at equilibrium (Kd) between the wild type and the Cys → Ser triple mutant for estradiol are very close (Table II and Fig.2). The main differences are found on the 17-OH and 3-OH side of estradiol (Fig. 3). Due to the antagonist position of H12, the cavity in the triple mutant is not sealed as in the wild type structure. On the O17 side (d-ring side) of estradiol, the cavity reaches the surface of the protein and results in a much larger volume than the wild type ligand binding pocket. This channel is partially filled with water molecules, forming numerous hydrogen bonds with the protein. On the 3-OH side (A-ring side) an open narrow tunnel filled with water molecules is present in the mutant. In the wild type, this tunnel is almost closed and only the water molecule interacting with the 3-OH of estradiol is present. In the Cys → Ser triple mutant the estradiol A-ring superimposes perfectly with its equivalent group in the wild type complex, whereas thed-ring is slightly shifted, as shown by the displacement of the C17, which moves 0.5 Å closer to helices H3 and H12 (Fig. 3).Table IIAffinity constant (KD in nm), estradiol efficient concentration (EC50 in nm), and raloxifene-inhibiting concentration (IC50 in nm) are compared for wild type and mutant GAL-ERsGAL-ERTransactivation yieldEC50IC50KD%nmWild type1002.7 ± 0.91.8 ± 0.40.26 ± 0.05C381S + C417S + C530S48 ± 49.8 ± 4.50.7 ± 0.10.92 ± 0.09E339A + E419A + K531A62 ± 65.4 ± 3.70.7 ± 0.21.39 ± 0.09 Open table in a new tab The superposition of the Cys → Ser triple mutant with the hERα-raloxifen complex reveals that Asp351, which anchors the ammonium moiety of raloxifen, adopts the same conformation in both structures. All the helices, including H12, match perfectly (r.m.s. deviation: 0.5 Å), the protruding chain of raloxifen fitting perfectly in the water channel observed in the mutant structure. Furthermore, in this structure, electron density could be observed for the loop 11–12, a region that was not seen in the ER LBD/raloxifen structure. This loop includes the C terminus of the shortened helix H11, in particular Lys529, which points toward the ligand binding pocket channel. ER pure antagonists exhibit acidic moieties in their protruding chain and are thus unlikely to interact with Asp351 as do raloxifen and tamoxifen. The present structure suggests Lys529 as a potential hydrogen bond partner for pure antagonist ligands bearing sulfinyl-like (ICI182780) (32Dauvois S. White R. Parker M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1377-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or sulfonyl-like (RU58668) (33Devin-Leclerc J. Meng X. Delahaye F. Leclerc P. Baulieu E.E. Catelli M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) groups in their protruding chain. Such a contact would cross the AF2 AD groove and hamper the agonist positioning of H12. Interestingly each single Cys → Ser mutation (C381S,C417S; C530S) contributes equally to the observed transactivation reduction for the triple mutant receptor (Fig.4 and Table II). Each single Cys → Ser mutation decreases the full-length receptor's activity by about 20%, whereas double mutations reduce CAT activity by ∼40%, and the triple mutant exhibits a 56% decrease. Maximal wild type activity could not be restored even in the presence of saturating estradiol concentrations. Moreover each time a cysteine is mutated to serine the ligand dose-response curve of the mutant receptor is slightly shifted to the right, leading to a 6-fold shift in the ligand-efficient concentration to trigger half-maximal activity (EC50 = 4.0 ± 1.5 nm) for the triple mutant, compared with the wild type receptor (EC50 = 0.7 ± 0.1 nm, Table II). To investigate the contribution of the AF1 on transcriptional activity, we used the chimeric receptors (GAL-ER) wild type and triple mutant on which the contribution of the ligand-independent transactivation function AF1 is removed. The Cys → Ser triple mutant displays 48% activity compared with the wild type GAL-ER, which is very close to the value observed for the full-length triple mutant receptor (44%, Fig. 2 b). These data showed that the residual transactivation activity in the triple mutant is not due to AF1. Antagonist competition assays with raloxifen revealed that this SERM represses more efficiently the estradiol-stimulated CAT activity of the Cys → Ser triple mutant GAL-ER than that of the wild type (Fig. 2 c). These data suggest that the activation helix can be more easily displaced from its optimal position in the triple mutant context than in the wild type. The cysteine mutation at position 381 induces a destabilization of the agonist position of H12, which is most likely due to a solvating effect. This residue is located in helix H4, and its side chain is directed toward the solvent and is located in the agonist binding groove of H12. This residue is accessible in the mutant structure where H12 is in the antagonist position. In the wild type structure the cysteine residue is precluded from the solvent by helix H12. In the present structure this residue, which is now serine, is still solvent-accessible and is involved in a water-mediated hydrogen bond network lining the helix H12 agonist binding groove. In the mutant receptor, a positioning of H12 in the agonist groove is possible but would require the desolvation of the serine residue, a process more energetically costly for a serine than for a cysteine. The C530S mutation disrupts the hydrophobic contact between Cys530 and Tyr526 (Fig. 5 b) and contributes to the shortening by one turn of helix H11 at its C terminus end, compared with the wild type structure. A serine residue exhibits different solvating properties and favors a coil structure with a surface-exposed side chain, as observed in the Cys → Ser triple mutant. The shortening of H11 and the subsequent lengthening of loop 11–12 allow H12 to reach the coactivator binding groove, as observed in the tamoxifen-ER complex. In the wild type structure, Cys417 is located in the rather flexible loop 6–7. Its side chain is involved in numerous hydrophobic contacts with neighboring residues (it forms van der Waals contacts with Phe337 inside an hydrophobic core composed of the N-terminal parts of H3 (Phe337, Leu345) and of the β-sheet (Leu410, Leu408; Fig.5 a). The substitution by a serine residue, by disrupting these hydrophobic contacts, is likely to be the triggering factor that induces the shortening of helix H3 by one turn at its N terminus. The conformational reorganization includes the last 10 residues of loop 1–3. Interestingly, the tamoxifen complex is nearly identical to the triple mutant in this region, whereas the raloxifen-bound structure exhibits a wild type conformation without shortening. Note that the overall Cys → Ser triple mutant structure is closer to that of the tamoxifen-bound LBD than to the raloxifen one. Nevertheless some differences remain between the mutant and tamoxifen structures, especially in the loop 6–7 region, which is shifted by more than 3.0 Å (Glu419 and Gly420) toward the core of the protein. This large movement in the antagonist structure is most likely induced by tamoxifen, whose aromatic"
https://openalex.org/W2045721146,"The recruitment of ZipA to the septum by FtsZ is an early, essential step in cell division in Escherichia coli. We have used polymerase chain reaction-mediated random mutagenesis in the yeast two-hybrid system to analyze this interaction and have identified residues within a highly conserved sequence at the C terminus of FtsZ as the ZipA binding site. A search for suppressors of a mutation that causes a loss of interaction (ftsZD373G) identified eight different changes at two residues within this sequence. In vitro, wild type FtsZ interacted with ZipA with a high affinity in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas FtsZD373G failed to interact. Two mutant proteins examined restored this interaction significantly.In vivo, the alleles tested are significantly more toxic than the wild type ftsZ and cannot complement a deletion. We have shown that a fusion, which encodes the last 70 residues of FtsZ in the two-hybrid system, is sufficient for the interaction with FtsA and ZipA. However, when the wild type sequence is compared with one that encodes FtsZD373G, no interaction was seen with either protein. Mutations surrounding Asp-373 differentially affected the interactions of FtsZ with ZipA and FtsA, indicating that these proteins bind the C terminus of FtsZ differently.

In bacteria, the study of cell division has defined many genes active in the formation and cleavage of a septum (1Margolin W. ASM News. 1999; 65: 137-143Google Scholar, 2Lutkenhaus J. Addinall S.

Currently, the earliest known step in the development of the septum is the formation of the Z-ring, a circular polymeric structure formed by the tubulin-like protein FtsZ (4Wang X. Lutkenhaus J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The cell division machinery assembles on the Z-ring in a sequential manner. Two proteins that act early in cell division, and directly on the Z-ring, are FtsA and ZipA (5Hale C. De Boer P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 167-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hale C. De Boer P.

Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The structure of FtsA has been solved recently (11van den Ent F. Lowe J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5300-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and it supports previous indications that it is similar to actin (12Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4919-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). FtsA may function by linking septum formation to peptidoglycan synthesis (8Ma X. Ehrhardt D.W. Margolin W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 93: 12998-13003Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar,14Weiss D.S. Chen J.C. Ghigo J.M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 508-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ZipA is an integral membrane protein that causes FtsZ fibers to bundle in vitro (15Hale C.A. Rhee A.C. de Boer P.J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5153-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 16RayChaudhuri D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2372-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). ZipA is thought to stabilize the FtsZ rings, in part because moderate overexpression of zipAcan suppress the ftsZ84 allele, which confers a defect in Z-ring formation (16RayChaudhuri D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2372-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The structure of the highly conserved C-terminal fragment of ZipA has been solved by x-ray crystallography and NMR, and it shows conservation to several RNA-binding proteins (17Mosyak L. Zhang Y. Glasfeld E. Haney S. Stahl M. Seehra J. Somers W.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3179-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 18Moy F. Glasfeld E. Mosyak L. Powers R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9146-9156Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses of cell division have identified many genes as conditional alleles, but detailed genetic analysis describing an individual protein·protein interaction is difficult, because many interacting proteins are involved, often simultaneously (19Dai K. Mukherjee A. Xu Y. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 175: 130-136Crossref Google Scholar, 20Huang J. Cao C. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5080-5885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ma X. Margolin W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7531-7544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of this, it is advantageous to develop a surrogate system that allows the study of a protein·protein interaction through genetic analysis (i.e. the study of a protein·protein interaction through the identification and characterization of mutations). The two-hybrid system of yeast (Y2H) 1The abbreviations used are:Y2Hyeast two-hybrid systemFOA5′-fluoroorotic acidYPDyeast-peptone media with glucoseSCsynthetic complete media, YNB, yeast nitrogen baseAT3-amino triazolebpbase pair(s)ELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside is one such system, because of the wide range of genetic techniques that exist for yeast (22Adams A.

Previous work has indicated that the C terminus of FtsZ is important for the interaction with both ZipA and FtsA (9Liu Z. Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Din N. Quardokus E.M. Sackett M.J. Brun Y.V. Mol.

Using a mutation in ftsZthat reduces the interaction with zipA in the Y2H system, we have searched for intragenic suppressors (additional mutations withinftsZ that reverse the phenotype of the initial loss-of-function mutation). This search has identified mutations within a small segment of ftsZ that encodes a conserved sequence at the C terminus. We have characterized the effect of these mutations on the interactions with ZipA and FtsA and determined the effect of the mutations on cell division. yeast two-hybrid system 5′-fluoroorotic acid yeast-peptone media with glucose synthetic complete media, YNB, yeast nitrogen base 3-amino triazole base pair(s) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside All strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1s. Oligonucleotides are listed in Table 2s. Both tables are published as supplemental material in the online version of this paper. Yeast and bacterial media were prepared by standard methods using materials readily available (22Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar, 23Gutherie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; : 194Google Scholar). SC, YPD and other general yeast media are described in these references. YNB, BactoAgar, BactoTryptone, BactoPeptone, and yeast extract were purchased from Difco. Amino acid mixtures (CSM-LUTH, CSM-AHT), raffinose, glucose, and galactose were purchased from Bio101. Amino acids, 5′-fluoroorotic acid (FOA), 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-galactoside, and aminotriazole were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Zymolyase was purchased from ICN Biologicals. All oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table 2s. FtsZ and ZipA were cloned by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from Escherichia coli strain MG1655. Wild type ftsZ cloned into pGAD424 was done by PCR amplification of the ftsZ gene from pDR3 using the oligos FtsZ-5′ and FtsZ-3′. The amplified PCR product was digested withMfeI and SalI and cloned into pGAD424 that was digested with EcoRI and BamHI. zipAwas amplified by PCR using oligos ZipA-5′ and ZipA-3′. The ZipA-5′ oligo results in a PCR product that deletes the membrane-spanning portion of the ZipA gene product. The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI and SalI and ligated into pLexA, to generate plasmid pSH47. This fragment was subsequently excised and cloned into pGAD424, which was digested identically to generate plasmid pSH230. The plasmid pSH228 was constructed by PCR amplification of plasmid pSH256 with oligos FtsZ-5′(311) and FtsZ-3′. The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI and SalI and cloned into pAS2-1. pSH229 was constructed in an identical manner, except that pSH41 was used as the template for the PCR reaction. pSH100 was constructed by PCR amplification of pAS1-ftsA, which was generously provided by Sandy Silverman, with oligos FtsA-5′ and ADHt. The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI andSalI and ligated into pAS2-1. Plasmid pSH232 was constructed by subcloning the ftsA gene into pGAD424, which had been digested with EcoRI and SalI as well. Strain SHy9 was generated by growing strain CG 1945 serially for two 10-ml overnight cultures, with about a 105 cell inoculum each, and plating on SC plates supplemented with 0.1% FOA, and colonies were allowed to grow for 5 days. Several colonies that grew were rechecked for all phenotypes, including loss of GAL1p-lacZ reporter activity. Strains SHy22 and SHy23 were generated by introducing pHO (kindly provided by Kim Arndt) into strain SHy9 and growing a transformant in 10 ml of SC-URA overnight. Cells were streaked onto a YPD plate and allowed to grow for 3 days. This plate was then replica printed onto an SC plate supplemented with 0.1% FOA. Colonies from this plate were patched onto a new YPD plate, grown overnight, and replica-printed onto an SPO plate. This plate was incubated at room temperature for 24 h and then at 30 °C for 5 days. Patches producing asci were then incubated with Zymolyase, and spores were separated by the random spores technique and plated on YPD (29Rockmill B. Lambie E.J. Roeder G.S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SHy22 and SHy23 are strains from spores of the same patch and differ only by mating type. Mutations in FtsZ were generated by PCR amplification of pSH27 (pGAD424-ftsZD45N,D373G) usingTaq DNA polymerase and reaction conditions that favored the incorporation of mutations. Oligonucleotides used as primers for amplification were GAL4ad and ADHt. These primers annealed to the GAL4 activation domain and the ADH terminator regions, respectively, and produced a PCR product that included about 300 bp of sequence on either side of the ftsZ gene. These regions of homology allowed for homologous recombination of the PCR fragment when cotransformed, with pGADGH vector DNA that had been linearized by digestion withEcoRI and BamHI, into SHy63 (30Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Recombinants were selected by leucine prototrophy. In this work, cotransformation with 100 ng of plasmid DNA and PCR fragment (each) resulted in about 1000 colonies, whereas transformation by either the vector or the PCR fragment alone resulted in zero to four colonies when plated onto LT plates. The interactions between the mutagenized ftsZ gene and zipA were tested by replica printing the transformants onto LHT plates supplemented with 0.5 mm AT. Colonies that grew after 3 days when incubated at 37 °C were scored as hits. Each colony was grown as a 5-ml culture and prepared using the Qiagen Qiaprep Turbo 8 miniprep kit as described by the manufacturer, except that 0.5 mg of Zymolyase was added per ml of buffer P1, and samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in this solution. These preparations were used to transform E. coli strain KC8 by electroporation, and colonies were selected by growth on M9 plates that were supplemented with 50 mg/liter ampicillin, but lacked leucine, as described by Golemis et al. (31Golemis E.A. Brent R. Bartel P.A. Fields S. The Yeast Two-Hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997: 43-72Google Scholar). Two to four colonies from each transformation plate were grown and prepared with the Qiagen miniprep kit again, this time without modification to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA from these preparations were analyzed by restriction analysis, and reconfirmation of the phenotypes was achieved by transforming into SHy23 again and rescoring the AT resistance. Mutations identified in the previous section were further characterized by introducing the identified mutation into a pGAD424-ftsZ construct. This was accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit by Stratagene. Mutagenesis was performed as described by the manufacturer. Oligonucleotides used in this work were: D373G/T, D373G/B; D373S/T, D373S/B; D373G, P375L/T, D373G, P375L/B, as listed in Table 2s. For the alanine-scanning mutations, site-directed changes were introduced into pGAD-ftsZD373G (pSH-201). The mutation that results in a change from D to G at position 373 also results in a loss of the EcoRV restriction site. Each of the oligo pairs encode a change that restores this restriction site, in addition to the change at the codon to be changed to alanine. The oligos used were: D370A/T, D370A/B; Y371A/T, Y371A/B; L372A/T, L372A/B; F377A/T, F377A/B; L378A/, L378A/B; R379A/T, R379A/B; K380A/T, K380A/B; Q381A/T, Q381A/B. Candidate clones were screened for the reacquisition of the EcoRV site. The wild type and mutant FtsZs were expressed with the N-terminal biotin tag MAGGLNDIFEAQKIEWH (32Schatz P.J. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) to enable detection in an ELISA. The lysine in this sequence is biotinylated in vivo by the E. coli enzyme BirA. Plasmids were constructed by inserting the coding sequence for the biotin tag between the NcoI and NdeI sites of pET28 (Novagen) using the oligos BIOTAG/T and BIOTAG/B. In addition,birA was amplified from the plasmid pBIOTRX-BirA (26Smith P.A. Tripp B.C. DiBlasio-Smith E.A. Lu Z. LaVallie E.R. McCoy J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) by PCR using the oligos BirA 5′ and BirA 3′, digested with HinD III and XhoI and ligated into the HindIII andXhoI sites of the same vector as the biotin tag to give the vector pETbio-birA. The genes ftsZ,ftsZD373G, ftsZD373S, andftsZD373G,P375L were subcloned from the vectors pDB312, pEG028, pSH187, or pSH189, respectively, into theNdeI and HindIII sites of pETbio-birA to give plasmids pEG045, pEG051, pEG052, and pEG053. Biotin-FtsZ and its mutants were expressed in the E. colistrain BL21(DE3)pLysS. Expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) once the A600 of the culture was between 0.5 and 1.0. At the same time, d-biotin was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for another 2–3 h, centrifuged, and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 10% glycerol) and stored at −70 °C. The proteins were then purified according to a previous report (33Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of biotin-FtsZ and its mutants were determined by the Bradford method. The extent of incorporation of biotin was determined by measuring the displacement of 2-(4′-hydroxyazobenzene)benzoic acid from avidin. In short, 40 μl of protein sample or buffer was mixed with 360 μl of 0.5 mg/ml avidin and 0.3 mm 2-(4′-hydroxyazobenzene)benzoic acid in 100 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. The decrease in absorbance at 500 nm was measured, and the concentration of biotin was determined using Δε500 × 10−3 = 34. The biotin-tagged FtsZs were between 50% and 75% biotinylated. ZipA-(23–328) was overexpressed from the plasmid pDB348 in BL21(DE3)plysS. Expression was induced as for biotin-FtsZ, above, and the cells were centrifuged, resuspended, and stored similarly. At the time of purification, the cells were thawed, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 1 mm, and the cells were lysed by passage through a French press. The cell extract was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and ZipA-(23–328) was precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 35% saturation. The ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in buffer A and dialyzed against buffer A overnight. ZipA-(23–328) was purified to homogeneity by passage over a Mono-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and elution with a 50–230 mm gradient of KCl in buffer A. The protein concentration of ZipA-(23–328) was determined as described according to Gill and von Hippel (34Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Analyt. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). The interaction between ZipA-(23–328) and biotin-FtsZ and its mutants was assayed in an ELISA format. ZipA-(23–328) was immobilized in the wells of an Immulon 4HBX 96-well plate in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl at 1 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C. Unbound ZipA-(23–328) was removed, and the wells were blocked with blocking buffer (0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS-T (10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20)). After two washes with PBS-T, biotin-FtsZ and its mutants were added at various concentrations in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound FtsZ was removed, and the wells were washed three times with PBS-T. Next, 0.1 μg/ml streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate in blocking buffer was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were washed four times after the removal of the conjugate. The horseradish peroxidase substrate o-phenylenediamine was then added in sodium phosphate-citric acid buffer, color development was stopped after a few minutes with 1.3 nH2SO4, and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured. E. coli morphology was determined by phase contrast microscopy of E. coli cells as described previously (5Hale C. De Boer P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 167-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Division phenotypes were determined phase microscopy. Plasmids used in this experiment are described in Table I. Cultures to be tested were grown for 36 h in 5 ml of SC-Leu-Trp media. New cultures were inoculated with 100 ml of the overnight cultures, and the new cultures were grown for 16 h. Cells densities were between 0.8 and 1.0A600 for these strains. Samples of these cultures were assayed for LacZ activity in quadruplicate, in a 96-well microtiter plate (100 μl per well). Samples were mixed with 100 μl of lysis buffer and substrate (40 μl of Promega cell lysis buffer, 40 μl of 0.125 mg/ml 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-galactoside (Sigma), and 20 μl of 10× β-galactosidase assay salts). Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 4–8 h with shaking and read on a Victor II fluorescence plate reader from Wallac. Fluorescence intensity increased with time, and after 8 h, negative control wells showed about 400 units, whereas positive control wells for the ZipA·FtsZ interaction showed about 50,000 units and for the FtsA·FtsZ interaction showed about 10,000 units. Our interest in developing a genetic system to characterize the FtsZ·ZipA interaction was piqued by the observation that a mutation in ftsZresulted in a reduced interaction with zipA, when studied in the yeast two-hybrid system. This observation was made when one of several clones derived by PCR amplification of E. coligenomic DNA was subcloned into the two standard two-hybrid systems. When ftsZN45D,D373G was expressed as a fusion to the B42 activation domain, an interaction was seen with zipAexpressed as a fusion to the LexA DNA binding domain. This interaction could clearly be scored in standard analyses, such as on indicator plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), and by leucine prototrophy, but was significantly less robust than a fusion to wild type ftsZ (Fig. 1). No interaction was seen when the mutated ftsZ allele was examined in the galactose system (Fig.2B, and results not shown). An examination of the mutations introduced during cloning suggested that one of the mutations could be important for the FtsZ·ZipA interaction. The first change was N45D, which has been characterized by Wang et al. (35Wang X. Huang J. Mukherjee A. Cao C. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5551-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) as one that affects the GTPase activity of FtsZ. This change was discounted as the cause of the altered interaction with ZipA by several experiments (Ref. 15Hale C.A. Rhee A.C. de Boer P.J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5153-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, and results not shown). This evidence includes the observation that ZipA binding to FtsZ is not affected by guanine nucleotides and that deletion analysis of FtsZ had already shown that the GTPase domain of FtsZ was not involved in binding to ZipA. The other mutation, D373G, resulted in a change in a highly conserved region of the C terminus of FtsZ (discussed below). At the time this project began, the role of this region in cell division had not been characterized. This mutation provided us with an opportunity to study how a mutation with diminished function could be used to characterize this interaction.Figure 2Isolation of intragenic suppressors of theftsZD373G mutation.A, mutations in ftsZ were generated by mutagenic PCR amplification of the ftsZD373G allele as a construct in pGAD424. Primers for the amplification were to sequences about 300 bp away from the multiple cloning site of the vector, allowing for cloning by in vivo recombination and expression of clones carrying mutations that restored the interaction offtsZ with zipA. B, growth phenotypes of pGADGH-ftsZ plasmids recovered from the screen. Plasmids were transformed into yeast strain CG1945, along with either plasmid pAS2-1 or plasmid pSH227 (pAS2-1-zipA), as indicated, grown overnight, and spotted onto the indicated plates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The lack of growth in the galactose system provided a clear strategy for determining which residues in FtsZ facilitate binding to ZipA, through the selection of intragenic suppressors. Selection of suppressors that restored the FtsZ·ZipA interaction was achieved by PCR mutagenesis of the whole ftsZ gene as cloned into pGAD424, using primers that annealed to the GAL4 activation domain fragment and the ADH terminator. The primers allowed ∼300-bp extensions to both ends of the ftsZ gene. These extensions provided regions of homology that allowed the PCR products to be cloned by recombination (Fig. 2A) (30Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The PCR products were transformed directly into strain SHy63 (a derivative of the Gal-Y2H strain CG1945 that had been previously transformed with pAS2-1-zipA), with the pGADGH vector that had been linearized, and is therefore not stable in yeast unless it has been repaired. Repair could be achieved by homologous recombination with the ends of the PCR products containing portions of the GAL4activation domain gene, and the ADHt terminator. Transformation into strain SHy63 allowed the selection of recombinant plasmids expressing ftsZ alleles. Alleles interacting with the Gal4bd-zipA fusion were identified through the activation of the GAL1p-HIS3 reporter. 73 colonies grew on plates that lacked histidine and were supplemented with 1 mm aminotriazole, two of which are shown in Fig.2B. Plasmids were recovered and retested in yeast, and 12 plasmids were purified that could be recovered, had normal restriction analysis patterns, and conferred plasmid-dependent phenotypes (histidine prototrophy only when"

Expression of activated Gq increased RGS2 association with the plasma membrane and decreased accumulation in the nucleus, suggesting that signal-induced redistribution may regulate RGS2 function. Thus, we identified and characterized a conserved N-terminal domain in RGS2 that is necessary and sufficient for plasma membrane localization. Mutational and biophysical analyses indicated that this domain is an amphipathic α-helix that binds vesicles containing acidic phospholipids. However, the plasma membrane targeting function of the amphipathic helical domain did not appear to be essential for RGS2 to attenuate signaling by activated Gq. Nevertheless, truncation mutants indicated that the N terminus is essential, potentially serving as a scaffold that binds receptors, signaling proteins, or nuclear components. Indeed, the RGS2 N terminus directs nuclear accumulation of GFP. Although RGS2 possesses a nuclear targeting motif, it lacks a nuclear import signal and enters the nucleus by passive diffusion. Nuclear accumulation of RGS2 does not limit its ability to attenuate Gq signaling, because excluding RGS2 from the nucleus was without effect.

Many hormones, neurotransmitters, and sensory stimuli elicit specific physiological responses in target tissues by activating receptors that are coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins1 (1Bourne H.R.

Activated receptors promote exchange of GTP for GDP on Gα subunits leading to dissociation of GTP-bound Gα subunits from Gβγ heterodimers and activation of downstream effector pathways. Signals are terminated following Gα-catalyzed hydrolysis of GTP and reformation of G protein heterotrimers. Thus, G proteins act as molecular switches to coordinate the wide range of responses elicited by extracellular stimuli. The regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a large family that regulate G protein signaling in part by acting as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for several classes of G protein α subunits (3Berman D.M.

Binding of RGS proteins to active Gα subunits can also interfere with effector binding, thereby blocking activation and downstream signaling (12Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These activities are mediated by the ∼120-amino acid RGS domain, a conserved feature of this protein family. Genetic studies in budding yeast (13Versele M. de Winde J.H. Thevelein J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5577-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and Caenorhabditis elegans (14Dong M.Q. Chase D. Patikoglou G.A. Koelle M.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2003-2014PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that eukaryotes express several types of RGS proteins to provide selective regulation of distinct G protein signaling pathways, and a means of differentially regulating a single pathway in response to various physiologic conditions. Similarly, certain mammalian RGS proteins have been shown to regulate selectively different G protein signaling pathways. For example, deletion of RGS2 in mice results in defects in T-cell activation, antiviral immunity, and hippocampal neuron function (15Oliveira-Dos-Santos A.J. Matsumoto G. Snow B.E. Bai D. Houston F.P. Whishaw I.Q. Mariathasan S. Sasaki T. Wakeham A. Ohashi P.S. Roder J.C. Barnes C.A. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Such differences in function are reflective of both differences in cell-specific RGS expression patterns as well as selectivity of RGS proteins for different signaling pathways. Many RGS proteins are co-expressed in a wide number of cell types and tissues. In such cases, specificity may be mediated in part through selectivity of RGS proteins for particular G protein substrates (16Heximer S.P. Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Bernard J.L. Linder M.E.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 2677-2682PubMed Google Scholar). More generally, however, RGS proteins are relatively nonselective toward G protein substrates in vitro. This suggests that the regulatory selectivity observed in cells (18Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Han J. Yaw L.P. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2851-2857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) is achieved by interaction with other signaling molecules. For example, the N terminus of RGS4 confers receptor-selective regulation of Gq-coupled responses (19Xu X. Zeng W. Popov S. Berman D.M. Davignon I., Yu, K. Yowe D. Offermanns S. Muallem S.

A. 1998; 95: 12973-12976Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, modular domains of RGS proteins may act as scaffolds to recruit specific classes of signaling proteins or alternatively as motifs that target these molecules to specific subcellular compartments. Accordingly, an emerging theme is that regulatory domains other than the RGS core domain mediate patterns of subcellular localization and that localization is a determinant of RGS protein function. Thus it is of interest that many of the small RGS proteins accumulate in compartments distinct from plasma membrane where their substrate G proteins reside (32Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This has led to the hypothesis that RGS protein association with other factors in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and Golgi helps to maintain an inactive pool of RGS proteins that can be recruited to the plasma membrane in response to specific signals (32Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,33Bowman E.P. Campbell J.J. Druey K.M. Scheschonka A. Kehrl J.H. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28040-28048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, G protein-mediated signals have been shown to induce plasma membrane translocation of RGS3 and RGS4 (34Dulin N.O. Sorokin A. Reed E. Elliott S. Kehrl J.H. Dunn M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 714-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,35Druey K.M. Sullivan B.M. Brown D. Fischer E.R. Watson N. Blumer K.J. Gerfen C.R. Scheschonka A. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18405-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms and functional importance of signal-induced recruitment to the plasma membrane of mammalian cells remain to be determined. A common approach to address these questions has involved heterologous expression of mammalian RGS proteins in yeast (36Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 37Chen C. Seow K.T. Guo K. Yaw L.P. Lin S.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Such studies have shown that several RGS isoforms can associate avidly and constitutively with the plasma membrane and that plasma membrane localization is required for inhibition of G protein-dependent pheromone signaling. More recently, this system has been used to identify putative plasma membrane targeting domains of several RGS proteins, revealing that a conserved N-terminal amphipathic α-helical domain is required for plasma membrane targeting and inhibition of G protein signaling (37Chen C. Seow K.T. Guo K. Yaw L.P. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19799-19806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 38Bernstein L.S. Grillo A.A. Loranger S.S. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, it has not been determined in mammalian cells whether these targeting motifs mediate stable or signal-induced association of RGS proteins with plasma membrane, and whether they are required for RGS proteins to attenuate G protein signaling. RGS2, like RGS1, RGS4, RGS5, and RGS16, is a member of the “small” mammalian RGS protein subfamily and contains a short N-terminal extension to the RGS box. Our previous data in yeast suggest that the N-terminal sequences of human RGS2 may contain domains important for its subcellular localization and function (16Heximer S.P. Srinivasa S.P.

Accordingly, the goals of the present study were first to define the determinants that mediate plasma membrane localization of RGS2 in yeast and next to determine whether the N-terminal domain of RGS2 governs subcellular localization and attenuation of Gq signaling in mammalian cells. Because RGS2 has been shown to localize to the nucleus of mammalian cells (32Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,33Bowman E.P. Campbell J.J. Druey K.M. Scheschonka A. Kehrl J.H. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28040-28048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we have also examined whether the nuclear localization is an important determinant of RGS2 function. The cytomegalovirus promoter on plasmid pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH; Palo Alto, CA) was used to express various RGS2-GFP constructs and a constitutively active Gqmutant (Q209L). Constitutively active Gq(R183C) construct in pCIS was a kind gift from Dr. J. Hepler (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). The thymidine kinase promoter-driven Renillaluciferase reporter (pRL-TK) used as a transfection control in transient assays was a kind gift from K. Murphy (Washington University, St. Louis). Polyclonal GFP antibody was the kind gift of P. Silver (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). Gq antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Unless otherwise stated, all other reagents and chemicals were from Sigma. Mammalian and yeast expression constructs were made by high fidelity polymerase chain reaction (Pfu, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and subsequent cloning into pEGFP-C1 or pVT102U, respectively (39Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). A strong translational initiation signal (Kozak consensus; GCCACCATGGCG) was incorporated at the initiator methionine of all clones to ensure robust expression. RGS2 point mutants were made using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were purified using an Endo-Free Maxi large scale DNA purification kit (Qiagen) and verified by DNA sequencing of the entire protein coding region. Expression of GFP-tagged cDNAs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaeand determination of RGS function in halo assays were as described previously (16Heximer S.P. Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S.

(Alabaster, AL), and were stored as chloroform stocks under argon at −80 °C. Small unilamellar liposomes were prepared as described previously (38Bernstein L.S. Grillo A.A. Loranger S.S. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Lipid ratios of the resulting liposomes were monitored by high performance thin layer chromatography. Vesicle preparations were used on the same day that they were prepared. Peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 34–57 in WT and mutant RGS2 were synthesized and purified using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (PNACL, Washington University, St. Louis). In the case of WT and each mutant peptide (K42A/R44A, W41A/L45A/F48A/L49A, L45D, and T43P) purity was confirmed using electrospray mass spectrometry. Stock solutions of the peptides were made by dissolving 15 mg of purified peptide in 1 ml of double-distilled water. The concentration of each peptide stock was determined by amino acid analysis. Stock solutions were aliquoted, stored at −20 °C, and thawed only once prior to CD spectrometric analysis. Far UV CD spectra of peptide samples were collected on a Jasco J600 Spectropolarimeter using a 1-mm path length quartz cell at ambient temperature. Spectra were recorded from 250 to 180 nm in 0.4 nm steps at 50 nm/min. Data represent the average of five independent spectra. Peptide and liposomes were diluted in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, to final concentrations of 30 μm and 4 mm, respectively. Background signals for the buffers and lipids were not significant and were subtracted from peptide spectra prior to analysis. Data are expressed as mean molar ellipticity (degrees cm2/dmol). The percentage α-helical contents of RGS peptides was estimated from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm as described previously (38Bernstein L.S. Grillo A.A. Loranger S.S. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells (7 × 106 in 10-cm plates) were washed in serum-free media and incubated with 6.4 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing a mixture of the following DNA constructs: 1 μg of pRL-TK; 1.5 μg of Gq(R183C); and 3 μg of RGS2-GFP or empty vector control (5.5 μg of total plasmid DNA/well) and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE. Following a 5-h incubation, the media were removed and replaced with maintenance media (described above) for recovery overnight. After 17 h of recovery, cells from each transfection were trypsinized and plated in 6-well (7 × 106 cells/well) and 10-cm dishes. For inositol hydrolysis assays, at 22 h post-transfection, culture media were replaced with labeling media containing 4 μCi/ml [3H]myoinositol in the presence of 10 mm LiCl and cells were incubated overnight. Phosphoinositide hydrolysis was determined as described previously (16Heximer S.P. Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Bernard J.L. Linder M.E. Hepler J.R. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34253-34259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and values were normalized to Renillaluciferase levels to account for differences in transient transfection efficiency. For determination of Renilla luciferase levels cells at 22–25 h, post-transfections were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in 250 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA), and spun at 12,000 × g to remove cellular debris. Duplicate 50-μl samples of the supernatant were measured for Renilla luciferase activity in a Optocomp II luminometer (MGM Instruments, Hamden, CT). Renillaluciferase substrate was diluted 1/25,000 in 10 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA for the assays. Levels of RGS and G protein expression were monitored on Western blots using ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells (2 × 105 per well on polylysine-coated coverslips) were transfected as described above using 1 μg of each construct to be studied. Following overnight recovery, maintenance media were replaced with microscopy media (maintenance media without phenol red and bicarbonate, containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). Confocal microscopy was performed on live cells using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope coupled to an MRC-1000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). Images represent single equatorial planes obtained with a × 63 objective. Confocal images were processed with Adobe Photoshop 4.0. The mating pheromone response pathway in the yeast S. cerevisiae is a G protein-coupled signaling pathway. Expression of mammalian RGS proteins in yeast cells lacking Sst2, the RGS protein homolog that normally attenuates pheromone signaling, permits rapid and quantitative analysis of function in pheromone-induced growth arrest (halo) assays (40Siderovski D.P.

Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). RGS protein function in halo assays is dependent on domains that direct plasma membrane targeting (36Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 37Chen C. Seow K.T. Guo K. Yaw L.P. Lin S.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Indeed, our previous studies indicated that the N-terminal domain of RGS2 is necessary for plasma membrane localization and function in yeast (16Heximer S.P. Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Bernard J.L. Linder M.E. Hepler J.R. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34253-34259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To identify the minimal region within the N-terminal domain required for targeting and function, we made a series of deletions within the N terminus of RGS2 and correlated their effects on membrane localization and attenuation of mating pheromone-induced G protein signaling in yeast (Fig.1 A). Deletion of the N-terminal 4, 15, or 32 amino acids result did not affect membrane localization or function. Deletion of the first 66 amino acids, however, resulted in loss of both membrane localization and inhibitory activity, as indicated by an increase in pheromone sensitivity (increased halo size). This result suggested that the domain in RGS2 necessary for membrane association maps between residues 32 and 66 in the N terminus (Fig. 2). When residues 33–67 were fused to the N terminus of GFP, the resulting protein localized to the plasma membrane, indicating that this sequence contained determinant(s) sufficient for plasma localization in yeast (Fig. 1 B).Figure 2Sequence and helical net comparisons of RGS2 with membrane association domains of RGS4 and RGS16. Shown is the schematic representation of the RGS2 membrane association domain (red), proximal to the N-terminal end of the RGS box (green). The corresponding sequence for this region was aligned to RGS4 and RGS16 by the CLUSTAL method, and the consensus is shown below. Shading indicates a hydrophobic core of aliphatic residues found along one face of the putative amphipathic α-helix identified in RGS4 and RGS16. Red sequences are conserved in all three sequences, and blue indicates conservation in two out of three sequences. The same region was represented as a helical net with residues flanking theshaded regions (hydrophobic core) shown in color. Aliphatic and nonpolar aromatic residues are shown as black,and basic residues are yellow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Sequence alignments indicated that the apparent N-terminal membrane targeting domain of RGS2 is conserved in a subset of the lower molecular weight RGS family members (Fig. 2), which includes RGS1, RGS2, RGS3, RGS4, RGS5, and RGS16 (only alignments for RGS2, RGS4, and RGS16 are shown). Because this region of RGS2 is similar in sequence to the amphipathic α-helical domains of RGS4 and RGS16 implicated in plasma membrane localization and function in yeast cells, we compared helical net views of these domains (Fig. 2). This analysis indicated that the apparent membrane-targeting domain of RGS2 also has the potential to form an amphipathic α-helix. Indeed, RGS2, RGS4, and RGS16 share a hydrophobic (aliphatic) core along one face of the putative helix that is flanked at the N-terminal end of the helix by two or more basic residues. These observations suggested that the N-terminal domain of RGS2 may function as an amphipathic α-helical membrane-targeting domain similar to those of RGS4 and RGS16. Furthermore, putative N-terminal amphipathic helices of RGS2, RGS4, and RGS16 are positioned immediately proximal to the RGS core domain, suggesting a similar organization of functional domains among this subset of RGS proteins. To determine whether the apparent membrane-targeting domain of RGS2 can adopt a α-helical conformation and interact with membranes, we analyzed the helical content of synthetic peptides corresponding to this region by CD spectroscopy in the presence or absence of phospholipid vesicles. Bernstein et al. (38Bernstein L.S. Grillo A.A. Loranger S.S. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) used a similar approach to show that the N-terminal membrane-targeting domain of RGS4 adopts a α-helix upon binding to negatively charged phospholipid vesicles. Several results indicated that, similar to RGS4, peptides derived from the N-terminal membrane-targeting domain of RGS2 adopt an α-helical conformation upon binding to vesicles containing anionic phospholipids (Fig. 3). A peptide corresponding to residues 34–57 of RGS2 adopted a random coil conformation in aqueous solution, indicated by the single minimum at 200 nm (Fig.3 B). The helix-forming potential of this peptide was characterized by minima at 208 and 222 nm in the presence of the helix-stabilizing solvent trifluoroethanol (data not shown). Addition of vesicles made from neutral lipids (DPPC) did not induce a helical conformation of the peptide (Fig. 3 A). However, addition of phospholipid vesicles made with anionic (DPPG) and neutral (DPPC) phospholipids at a mole ratio of 10:90 caused the peptide to adopt a more α-helical conformation. Apparent α-helical content increased upon increasing the mole fraction of DPPG, reaching a maximum helical content at a 40:60 ratio of DPPG:DPPC (Fig. 3, A andB). To determine whether an amphipathic character of the RGS2 peptide is required for helix formation and/or binding to phospholipid vesicles, we analyzed a series of peptides with amino acid substitutions predicted to affect the amphipathic nature of the helix (Fig.3 C). The mutations used were designed to reduce the aliphatic (W41A/L45A/F48A/L49A) or basic (K42A/ R44A/L45D) nature of the amphipathic helix core. These mutations did not alter the ability of the resulting peptides to form a α-helix since each mutant peptide showed similar helix-forming potential as the wild type in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (data not shown). However, the mutant peptides did display an impaired ability to adopt an α-helical conformation in the presence of vesicles containing anionic phospholipids. Substitutions predicted to decrease or disrupt the aliphatic nature of the hydrophobic face decreased lipid-induced helix formation. Similarly, introducing a negatively charged residue along the putative membrane-binding interface resulted in reduced helix formation, whereas changing positive residues in the putative amphipathic helix to alanine had little effect in this assay. These data indicated that in the case of the RGS2 helix, the aliphatic interface is a primary determinant of its ability to interact with lipid vesicles. Although previous studies have characterized N-terminal lipid association domains in other small RGS proteins, the functional importance of these domains in mammalian cells has not been rigorously addressed. Therefore, we set out to define the role of the N terminus of RGS2 in mediating localization and function in mammalian ce"
https://openalex.org/W2051294804,"Tankyrase is an ankyrin repeat-containing poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase originally isolated as a binding partner for the telomeric protein TRF1, but recently identified as a mitogen-activated protein kinase substrate implicated in regulation of Golgi vesicle trafficking. In this study, a novel human tankyrase, designated tankyrase 2, was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a binding partner for the Src homology 2 domain-containing adaptor protein Grb14. Tankyrase 2 is a 130-kDa protein, which lacks the N-terminal histidine/proline/serine-rich region of tankyrase, but contains a corresponding ankyrin repeat region, sterile α motif module, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase homology domain. TheTANKYRASE 2 gene localizes to chromosome 10q23.2 and is widely expressed, with mRNA transcripts particularly abundant in skeletal muscle and placenta. Upon subcellular fractionation, both Grb14 and tankyrase 2 associate with the low density microsome fraction, and association of these proteins in vivo can be detected by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Deletion analyses implicate the N-terminal 110 amino acids of Grb14 and ankyrin repeats 10–19 of tankyrase 2 in mediating this interaction. This study supports a role for the tankyrases in cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways and suggests that vesicle trafficking may be involved in the subcellular localization or signaling function of Grb14.AF329696 Tankyrase is an ankyrin repeat-containing poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase originally isolated as a binding partner for the telomeric protein TRF1, but recently identified as a mitogen-activated protein kinase substrate implicated in regulation of Golgi vesicle trafficking. In this study, a novel human tankyrase, designated tankyrase 2, was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a binding partner for the Src homology 2 domain-containing adaptor protein Grb14. Tankyrase 2 is a 130-kDa protein, which lacks the N-terminal histidine/proline/serine-rich region of tankyrase, but contains a corresponding ankyrin repeat region, sterile α motif module, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase homology domain. TheTANKYRASE 2 gene localizes to chromosome 10q23.2 and is widely expressed, with mRNA transcripts particularly abundant in skeletal muscle and placenta. Upon subcellular fractionation, both Grb14 and tankyrase 2 associate with the low density microsome fraction, and association of these proteins in vivo can be detected by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Deletion analyses implicate the N-terminal 110 amino acids of Grb14 and ankyrin repeats 10–19 of tankyrase 2 in mediating this interaction. This study supports a role for the tankyrases in cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways and suggests that vesicle trafficking may be involved in the subcellular localization or signaling function of Grb14.

Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). A variety of protein modules have been identified that mediate these interactions including SH21 domains, which bind specific phosphotyrosine-containing peptide sequences; SH3 domains, which target specific proline-rich motifs with a PXXP core; and PDZ domains, which interact with the C-terminal consensus (S/T/Y)X(V/I) (2Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar, 3Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Another module, the PH domain, also mediates intermolecular interactions, but here the targets are predominantly specific polyphosphoinositides and inositol polyphosphates (4Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These modules may be found in signaling proteins that possess a catalytic activity (e.g. c-Src and phospholipase C-γ); the adaptor class (e.g. Grb2), which provide a molecular link to separate effector molecules; and proteins that provide an anchoring or scaffolding function, e.g.PSD-95 (1Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). As well as initiating signaling events, protein-protein interactions are also important in regulating the internalization of cell surface receptors and their subsequent sorting to lysosomal or recycling compartments (5Owen D.J. Luzio J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 6Lemmon S.K. Traub L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The Grb7 family is a group of related SH2 domain-containing adaptors, comprising Grb7, -10, and -14 (7Daly R.J. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These proteins share significant sequence homology and a conserved molecular architecture, consisting of a N-terminal region containing the motif P(S/A)IPNPFPEL, a central PH domain-containing region (designated the GM domain), which bears homology to the Caenorhabditis elegans protein Mig10 and a C-terminal SH2 domain. The family members differ in their specificity and modes of receptor recruitment. Grb7 binds via its SH2 domain to a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including erbB2, erbB3, and Shc (7Daly R.J. Cell.

Mickey G. Maher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7771-7778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A 50-amino acid region between the PH and SH2 domains (BPS domain) contributes to binding of Grb10 and Grb14 to the IR (11He W. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol.

Burnol A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26026-26035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The signaling function of the Grb7 family is poorly understood. One role for Grb10 and -14 may be as negative regulators of IR signaling. For example, overexpression of Grb14 reduces insulin-induced DNA and glycogen synthesis (12Kasus-Jacobi A. Perdereau D. Auzan C. Clauser E. Van Obberghen E. Mauvais-Jarvis F. Girard J. Burnol A. J. Biol.

This system allows for the possibility that the same variant will be identified in different species, and should therefore be given the same isoform designation (indicated by a Greek letter). (Grb-IR) (14Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) or Grb14 (12Kasus-Jacobi A. Perdereau D. Auzan C. Clauser E. Van Obberghen E. Mauvais-Jarvis F. Girard J. Burnol A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26026-26035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, data supporting a positive role for mGrb10α in insulin-, IGF-1-, and platelet-derived growth factor BB-stimulated mitogenesis have recently been presented (15Wang J. Dai H. Yousaf N. Moussaif M. Deng Y. Boufelliga A. Rama Swamy O. Leone M.E. Riedel H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6217-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is also likely that the functional role of the Grb7 family extends beyond signal modulation. For example, inhibition of Grb7 expression suppresses the invasive potential of esophageal cancer cells (16Tanaka S. Mori M. Akiyoshi T. Tanaka Y. Mafune K. Wands J.R. Sugimachi K. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and overexpression of Grb7 and its targeting to focal contacts correlates with increased cell motility (17Han D.C. Shen T.-L. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Definition of the molecular interactions mediated by Grb7 family proteins, particularly those involving the N-terminal and GM domains, may provide a valuable insight into their signaling mechanism and how it is regulated. With regard to the N-terminal region, the SH3 domain of c-Abl binds the conserved proline-rich motif of Grb10 in vitro (18Frantz J.D. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Ottinger E.A. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2659-2667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but an in vivo binding partner has yet to be identified. In this paper we describe the identification of a novel tankyrase, tankyrase 2, as a binding partner for the Grb14 N terminus. Tankyrase was originally identified by virtue of an interaction with the telomeric protein TRF1, and consists of a N-terminal HPS region, 24 consecutive ankyrin-type repeats, a SAM module, and a C-terminal region with homology to the PARP catalytic domain (19Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). A small fraction of tankyrase co-localizes with TRF1 at telomeres, and tankyrase can ADP-ribosylate TRF1 in vitro, leading to a reduction in binding of TRF1 to telomeric DNA. Consequently, one function of tankyrase may be in regulation of telomere function via ADP-ribosylation. However, the majority of tankyrase is extranuclear, and a recent study identified it as a peripheral membrane protein associated with the Golgi, where it localizes to Glut4 vesicles via the IRAP cytosolic domain and acts as a substrate for insulin and growth factor-induced MAP kinase activity (20Chi N.-W. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38437-38444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Interestingly, tankyrase 2 is also predominantly cytoplasmic and associates with the LDM fraction. The association of tankyrase 2 with Grb14 supports the hypothesis that tankyrases may provide a link between signal transduction pathways and vesicle trafficking. A plasmid construct encoding a Gal4 DNA-BD-Grb14 fusion was generated as follows. The plasmid GRB14/pRcCMVF containing full-lengthGRB14 cDNA (21Daly R.J. Sanderson G.M. Janes P.J. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12502-12510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was digested with HindIII and Klenow-treated to create blunt ends, and then digested withBclI to release three fragments of ∼1.1, 4.2, and 1.7 kb. The 1.7-kb fragment was isolated and cloned into the NdeI (Klenow-treated) and BamHI sites of the yeast expression vector pAS2–1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to generate GRB14/pAS2–1 containing an in-frame fusion of full-length Grb14 with the Gal4 DNA-BD. This construct was introduced by electroporation into the yeast strain CG1945 selecting for tryptophan prototrophy. Following preparation of yeast cell extracts by trichloroacetic acid protein extraction, the expression of the fusion protein was verified by Western blot analysis with antibodies directed against the Flag epitope or the Gal4 DNA-BD. The recipient strain was then grown to mid-log phase and a human liver cDNA library in the vector pACT2 (CLONTECH) introduced using the LiAc procedure (22Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for tryptophan, leucine, and histidine prototrophy in the presence of 5 mm3-aminotriazole and then tested for β-galactosidase activity by either a liquid culture-based method (Galacto-Light, Tropix, Bedford, MA) or colony lift filter assay (CLONTECH). Clones scoring positive in the β-galactosidase assays were subjected to CHX curing to remove the bait plasmid by streaking out on synthetic complete-leu media containing 10 μg/ml CHX (pAS2–1 contains theCYH2 gene which restores CHX sensitivity to CG1945 cells). This enabled confirmation of the bait dependence of LacZactivation and subsequent isolation of the pACT2 plasmids encoding interacting proteins by standard methodology (23Philippsen P. Stotz A. Scherf C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 170-177Google Scholar). Back transformations were then performed in which these pACT2 plasmids were introduced into CG1945 strains containing the bait plasmid (GRB14/pAS2–1) or constructs encoding non-related Gal4 DNA-BD fusions in order to confirm the specificity of the interactions. The DNA sequences of the cDNA inserts were then obtained by cycle sequencing (Promega, Annandale, New South Wales, Australia) using pACT2-specific and/or clone-specific primers. In order to identify the region of Grb14 that interacts with tankyrase 2, a series of Grb14 deletion mutants were generated by cloning polymerase chain reaction fragments synthesized using the appropriate flanking primers into the vector pAS2–1. These fragments spanned the following regions: N terminus (amino acids 1–110), the central region encompassing the Mig10 homology and the BPS domain (amino acids 110–437), and the N-terminal and central regions (amino acids 1–437). These plasmids were individually transformed into the yeast strain Y190. Following transformation of the resulting yeast strains with the TANKYRASE 2 cDNA clone L1 in pACT-2, the strength of the interaction was determined by either liquid- or filter-based β-galactosidase assays. Expression of the constructs was confirmed by Western blotting of yeast extracts with Gal4 DNA-BD- and Gal4 AD-specific antibodies. In order to investigate the interaction of tankyrase 2 with TRF1, a fragment of tankyrase 2 corresponding to the 10-ankyrin repeat region of tankyrase responsible for TRF1 binding (TR1L12) (19Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) was expressed as a Gal4 AD fusion in pGAD10 (CLONTECH). Binding of this to LexA fusions of full-length TRF1 and TRF1 lacking the tankyrase binding site (amino acids 1–67) was then performed as described previously (19Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Following the isolation of the original TANKYRASE 2 cDNA, further clones were isolated by standard cDNA library screening methodology (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA probes were labeled by random primer extension (Promega) using [α-32P]dCTP (110 TBq/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Pty Ltd, Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia). Following isolation of phage or phagemid DNA (Promega Wizard kits), sequencing of the cDNA inserts was performed by cycle sequencing. The cDNA cloning strategy was as follows, and further cDNA clone details can be provided upon request. The original TANKYRASE 2 cDNA isolated from the two hybrid screen (L1) was used as a probe to screen a λgt10 human placental cDNA library (5′ Stretch Plus,CLONTECH). This isolated two clones, designated P8 and P12. P8 was ∼2.0 kb and provided the C-terminal end of the tankyrase 2 protein sequence. P12 was ∼3.5 kb and extended the cDNA sequence 0.9 kb in the 5′ direction. Screening of the human placental cDNA library and a λgt11 human small intestine cDNA library (5′ Stretch, CLONTECH) with 5′-located probes led to the isolation of two clones, designated P5 and SI4, respectively, which both extended the sequence further 5′ and provided a putative translation initiation codon. Screening of a λZAP II human fetal brain cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with a 414-bp probe including the extended sequence isolated two further clones, FB3 and FB11, which confirmed this sequence. Sequence alignments were performed using the program ClustalW. The cDNA was first assembled in the vector Bluescript SK+ (Stratagene) containing alterations to the multiple cloning site (MCS). The MCS was changed by insertion of annealed oligonucleotides 5′-GGCCGCGGATCCCGGCTCGAGCGGGAATTCCATGCCATGGCATGCCAAGCTTTCTAGAG-3′ and 5′-TCGACTCTAGAAAGCTTGGCAT- GCCATGGCATGGAATTCCCGCTCGAGCCGGGATCCGC-3′ into the NotI/XhoI sites to provide the modified cloning site NotI, BamHI,XhoI, EcoRI, NcoI, HindIII,XbaI and to destroy the original XhoI site, creating the vector BSK (ΔMCS). The first 495 bp of TANKYRASE 2 were obtained as a BamHI/XhoI fragment from FB11, and inserted into the BamHI/XhoI sites of BSK (ΔMCS) creating BSK(I). The next 840 bp were obtained as aXhoI/EcoRI fragment from SI4 and cloned into theXhoI/EcoRI sites of BSK(I) creating BSK(II). The following 1104 bp were obtained as a EcoRI/NcoI fragment from L1 and inserted into the EcoRI/NcoI site in BSK(II), creating BSK(III). The final 1361 bp were obtained as a NcoI/HindIII fragment from P8, and cloned into the NcoI/HindIII site in BSK(III), creating BSK(IV). The assembled TANKYRASE 2 cDNA was subcloned into the NotI/XbaI sites of pcDNA 3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Coupled transcription/translation reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The originalTANKYRASE 2 cDNA clone (L1) subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was nick-translated with biotin-14-dATP and hybridized in situ at a final concentration of 15 ng/μl to metaphases from two normal males. The FISH method was modified from that described previously (25Callen D.F. Baker E. Eyre H.J. Chernos J.E. Bell J.A. Sutherland G.R. Ann. Genet. 1990; 33: 219-221PubMed Google Scholar) in that chromosomes were stained before analysis with both propidium iodide (as counterstain) and DAPI (for chromosome identification). Images of metaphase preparations were captured by a cooled charged coupled device camera using the ChromoScan image collection and enhancement system (Applied Imaging Corporation, Newcastle, United Kingdom). FISH signals and the DAPI banding pattern were merged for figure preparation. Human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The radiolabeled probe utilized was the TANKYRASE 2 cDNA clone L1 labeled by random primer extension (Promega) using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The following regions of tankyrase 2 were expressed as GST fusion proteins; amino acids 324–980 (corresponding to clone L1 and construct 1 in Fig. 8), amino acids 324–870 (construct 2), amino acids 324–630 (construct 3), amino acids 631–980 (construct 4, also used to generate Ab-1), amino acids 486–630 (used to generate Ab-5), and amino acids 871–935 (construct 5). Construct 1 was generated by subcloning aSalI-XhoI fragment from pACT2 into theNdeI site of pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA fragments encoding the other regions were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using flanking primers containing restriction enzyme sites for in-frame directional insertion into this vector. Following cloning and transformation of the resulting plasmids intoEscherichia coli DH5α, GST fusion proteins were purified from isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced bacterial cultures as described previously (26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). DU145 human prostate cancer cells, HEK293 cells, and HEK293 cells stably transfected with theGRB14/pRcCMVF expression vector were maintained as described previously (21Daly R.J. Sanderson G.M. Janes P.J. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12502-12510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the cells were starved overnight in medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum. These techniques were as described previously (27Janes P.W. Daly R.J. deFazio A. Sutherland R.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3601-3608PubMed Google Scholar), except that the lysis and wash buffers used for detection of Grb14-tankyrase 2 co-immunoprecipitation contained 0.1% Triton X-100. DU145 cells were serum-starved overnight in RPMI/0.5% fetal calf serum and then harvested (1 ml/150-mm dish) in subcellular fractionation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell suspensions were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles and then Dounce homogenization until, by microscopic inspection, the majority of the nuclei were released. The samples were then centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min (to isolate the low speed pellet), 50,000 × g for 20 min (to isolate the HDM), and 160,000 × g for 70 min (to isolate the LDM). The pellets from each centrifugation step were resuspended in subcellular fractionation buffer at 10% of the original volume, and the remaining supernatant was then concentrated to the same volume using a Microcon YM-10 centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Equivalent amounts of each fraction (i.e.normalized for cell number) were then analyzed by Western blotting. GST or the appropriate GST fusion protein were purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma, Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia) (26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) and then cross-linked to the beads using dimethylpimelimidate (Sigma) (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 524-525Google Scholar) to generate affinity columns. The rabbit antiserum was diluted 1:10 with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and applied to the GST column. The flow-through was then applied to the GST fusion protein column. Following washing with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, the bound antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and immediately neutralized with 1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The antibodies were finally subjected to buffer exchange with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl using a Centricon 30 microconcentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Commercially available antibodies used were as follows: M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), monoclonal anti-golgi 58 kDa protein FTCD (29Gao Y.-S. Alvarez C. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33825-33834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Sigma), monoclonal anti-GAL4 AD antibody (CLONTECH), monoclonal anti-GAL4 DNA-BD antibody (CLONTECH), goat polyclonal anti-Grb14 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and D8 polyclonal anti-Flag antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Five μg of GST or GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with 400 μl of lysate (∼5 mg/ml total protein) from serum-starved HEK/Grb14 cells (21Daly R.J. Sanderson G.M. Janes P.J. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12502-12510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) for 2 h at 4 C. The beads were then washed three times with cell lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, bound Grb14 was detected by Western blotting with antibody D8 against the Flag epitope tag. Cells grown on culture slides in RPMI/10% fetal calf serum were rinsed twice in PBS, fixed at room temperature in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After extensive washing, fixed cells were blocked in 10% normal goat serum or 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature for 45 min and subsequently incubated with antibodies against tankyrase 2 (Ab-5, 1:50) and Golgi 58-kDa protein (1:50) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 C. After extensive washes in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor™ 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:50, Molecular Probes Inc, Eugene, OR) and Alexa Fluor™ 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:50, Molecular Probes) for 45 min at room temperature. To detect Grb14, cells were stained as above with anti-Grb14 antibody (1:100), followed by Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody (1:50, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc, West Grove, PA). Following washing, samples were mounted in Vectashield plus DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Images were acquired on a Leica DMR microscope (Leica Microsystems Pty Ltd, Gladesville, New South Wales, Australia) using the TCS SP software. In order to identify binding partners for the Grb14 adaptor protein, a human liver cDNA library in the Gal4 AD vector pACT2 was screened using a full-length Grb14 bait expressed as a Gal4 DNA-BD fusion. From a screen of ∼1 × 106clones, 31 colonies were initially selected on synthetic complete −Leu−His−Trp medium and were then tested for β-galactosidase activity. Nine clones gave significant activity in the latter assay and were characterized by DNA sequencing. One of these pACT2 clones harbored a novel cDNA of 1971 bp. This clone encoded a polypeptide of 657 amino acids in frame with the Gal4 DNA-BD and exhibited homology to tankyrase (19Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), but the absence of translation start and stop codons revealed that the cDNA clone was incomplete. Screening of cDNA libraries using the original TANKYRASE 2 clone L1 as probe led to the isolation of a series of overlapping cDNA clones, which provided the full-length TANKYRASE 2 cDNA sequence. 3The nucleotide sequence for the humanTANKYRASE 2 cDNA has been deposited in the GenBank™ database under GenBank accession no. AF329696. We note close matches with sequences deposited under the following accession numbers:AF264912, AX029397, AF305081, and AK023746. This revealed an open reading frame for tankyrase 2 spanning 1166 amino acids, encoding a polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 130 kDa. The protein sequence for tankyrase 2 aligned with that of tankyrase (19Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 1. The original cDNA clone isolated by the two hybrid screen, clone L1, spans amino acids 324–980 of the full-length sequence. The major difference between the two proteins is the absence of a HPS domain in tankyrase 2. The molecular architecture of tankyrase 2, starting at the ankyrin repeat region, is then similar to tankyrase. Both proteins possess 24 ankyrin-type repeats, aligned in Smithet al. (19Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), with an overall sequence identity of 83% and sequence similarity of 90%. The major differences between the two proteins in this region occur at the C termini of ankyrin repeats 1, 14, and 24 and the N terminus of repeat 24, where there are five or more non-conservative changes, and the C terminus of repeat 23, where there is a non-conservative change and then an insertion of 7 amino acids in tankyrase 2 relative to tankyrase (Fig. 1). The ankyrin repeat region is then followed by a SAM domain, exhibiting 77% sequence identity and 89% similarity. The most closely related region is the C-terminal PARP homology domain, with 93% sequence identity and 96% similarity. Critical residues required for NAD+ binding and catalysis are entirely conserved. The TANKYRASE 2 gene was localized by FISH. Twenty metaphases from a normal male were examined for fluorescent signal. All of these metaphases showed signal on one or both chromatids of chromosome"
https://openalex.org/W2154231396,"Previous genetic studies have revealed a multicomponent signal transduction chain, consisting of an H2 sensor, a histidine protein kinase, and a response regulator, which controls hydrogenase gene transcription in the proteobacterium Ralstonia eutropha. In this study, we isolated the H2 sensor and demonstrated that the purified protein forms a complex with the histidine protein kinase. Biochemical and spectroscopic analysis revealed that the H2 sensor is a cytoplasmic [NiFe]-hydrogenase with unique features. The H2-oxidizing activity was 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of standard hydrogenases and insensitive to oxygen, carbon monoxide, and acetylene. Interestingly, only H2 production but no HD formation was detected in the D2/H+ exchange assay. Fourier transform infrared data showed an active site similar to that of standard [NiFe]-hydrogenases. It is suggested that the protein environment accounts for a restricted gas diffusion and for the typical kinetic parameters of the H2 sensor. EPR analysis demonstrated that the [4Fe-4S] clusters within the small subunit were not reduced under hydrogen even in the presence of dithionite. Optical spectra revealed the presence of a novel, redox-active, n = 2 chromophore that is reduced by H2. The possible involvement of this chromophore in signal transduction is discussed.

Sensors for O2, CO, and NO have been described, and the signaling mechanism is the subject of current research (1Ignarro L.J. Degnan J.N. Baricos W.H. Kadowitz P.J. Wolin M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 718: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 2Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One of the best studied examples is the two-component FixL-FixJ system of Rhizobium meliloti andBradyrhizobium japonicum. In this case the presence of O2 is detected by a heme-containing histidine protein kinase (4Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The heme group in FixL binds the oxygen molecule that induces a transition of the ferrous iron from high spin to low spin. This triggers the inactivation of the kinase domain of FixL. The release of O2, at low O2 tensions, restores the S = 2 state of the heme iron, which in turn leads to activation of the kinase by autophosphorylation. Subsequent phosphoryl transfer to the response activator FixJ finally stimulates gene transcription (5Gong W. Hao B. Mansy S.S. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Chan M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15177-15182Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In the facultative chemolithotrophic proteobacterium Ralstonia eutropha (formerly Alcaligenes eutrophus), the oxidation of molecular hydrogen is catalyzed by two [NiFe]-hydrogenases, a membrane-bound (MBH)1 and a cytoplasmic NAD-reducing hydrogenase (SH) (6Schink B. Schlegel H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 567: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 7Schneider K. Schlegel H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 452: 66-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The structural genes of both [NiFe]-hydrogenases together with sets of accessory genes are grouped in the MBH and SH operons, which are induced in the presence of molecular hydrogen (8Schwartz E. Gerischer U. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lenz O. Friedrich B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12474-12479Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Hydrogenase gene transcription is controlled by a multicomponent regulatory system consisting of the proteins HoxB, HoxC, HoxJ, and HoxA, which are encoded in the MBH operon (8Schwartz E. Gerischer U. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lenz O. Friedrich B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HoxJ and HoxA share typical features of a bacterial two-component regulatory system that recognizes and responds to various environmental stimuli (9Lenz O. Friedrich B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 12474-12479Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and communicates with the activator HoxA, 2M. Forgber, O. Lenz, E. Schwartz, and B. Friedrich, unpublished results. a member of the NtrC family of response regulators (12Eberz G. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1845-1854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HoxA, the final target of the H2-sensing signal transduction chain, binds to the upstream region of the hydrogenase promoters and activates open complex formation by ς54 RNA polymerase (8Schwartz E. Gerischer U. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zimmer D. Schwartz E. Tran-Betcke A. Gewinner P. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2373-2380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic studies revealed that recognition of H2 requires in addition to HoxA and HoxJ the protein HoxBC (9Lenz O. Friedrich B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12474-12479Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Proteins similar to HoxBC, designated HupUV, have been identified in Rhodobacter capsulatus and B. japonicum (14Elsen S. Colbeau A. Chabert J. Vignais P.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5174-5181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Black L.K. Fu C. Maier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7102-7106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HoxBC-like proteins show typical features of a [NiFe]-hydrogenase (16Kleihues L. Lenz O. Bernhard M. Buhrke T. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2716-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although HoxBC is essential for lithoautotrophic growth of R. eutropha (9Lenz O. Friedrich B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12474-12479Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), it cannot compensate for the loss of the MBH and the SH. This observation points to a regulatory rather than an energy-yielding function of the HoxBC protein (16Kleihues L. Lenz O. Bernhard M. Buhrke T. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2716-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The low level of expression combined with an extremely low activity allowed only preliminary biochemical analysis of HoxBC in crude extracts (17Pierik A. Schmelz M. Lenz O. Friedrich B. Albracht S.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Attempts to express a functional HoxBC protein in Escherichia coli were unsuccessful. This prompted us to develop a homologous overexpression system in R. eutropha (16Kleihues L. Lenz O. Bernhard M. Buhrke T. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2716-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and to use it successfully for the purification of HoxBC, later named regulatory hydrogenase (RH). Biochemical and spectroscopic analysis of the homogenous RH uncovered unique enzymatic features that are clearly distinct from the properties of standard hydrogenases. The data suggest that the RH shows a common [NiFe] active site but displays significant changes in the protein environment. In order to study the mechanism of H2 signal transduction in more depth, we began to establish an in vitro system, using purified components. First data show that the RH forms a specific complex with the sensor kinase HoxJ, supporting the notion that the RH is a direct component of the signal transduction chain. R. eutropha strain HF371, a derivative of R. eutropha H16, harboring plasmid pGE378, was used for protein purification (16Kleihues L. Lenz O. Bernhard M. Buhrke T. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2716-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cells were heterotrophically grown in a mineral medium in a 10-liter Braun Biostat fermentor (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) at 30 °C under hydrogenase derepressing conditions. At an OD436 of 11 the cells were harvested, washed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (K-PO4 buffer), and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells (83 g, wet weight) were resuspended in 30 ml of K-PO4 buffer containing 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were disrupted by two passages through a chilled Amicon French press cell at 1100 pounds/square inch (75.8 bar). Soluble extracts were prepared by high speed centrifugation (100 000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C). The resulting supernatant was degassed and saturated with hydrogen. The extract was kept under an atmosphere of 100% H2 and subsequently incubated for 10 min at 65 °C. After the heat treatment the sample was chilled on ice. All further purification steps were carried out under air. The denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation (13 000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was fractionated by addition of (NH4)2SO4 to give a final concentration of 1 m. The precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation (13 000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the clear supernatant was directly applied to a POROS 20ET column (Applied Biosystems; ethyl ether; 10 × 100 mm), preequilibrated with K-PO4 buffer containing 1m (NH4)2SO4 at a flow rate of 40 ml/min (BioCAD Perfusion Chromatography Workstation). The column was washed with 2 bed volumes of K-PO4 buffer containing 1 m(NH4)2SO4. The protein was eluted with K-PO4 buffer containing 0.4 m(NH4)2SO4, and fractions of 4 ml were collected. The active fractions of several column runs were combined, concentrated, and dialyzed against K-PO4 buffer. The RH was further purified on a POROS 20HQ column (Applied Biosystems; quarternized polyethyleneimine; 4.6 × 100 mm) preequilibrated with K-PO4 buffer. The eluent was pooled, concentrated (Centriprep-10; Amicon), and directly frozen in liquid N2. Protein concentrations were determined according to the methods of Lowry et al. (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide/SDS gels and transferred to Protran BA85 nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll). HoxC was detected with anti-HoxC serum, diluted 1:1000, and an alkaline-phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). The histidine protein kinase HoxJ was overproduced in E. coli and purified as a polyhistidine-tagged protein, His6-HoxJ, by metal chelate affinity chromatography (9Lenz O. Friedrich B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12474-12479Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Purified His6-HoxJ and RH were mixed and subsequently applied to a native 4–15% polyacrylamide gel. Native gel electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (19Bernhard M. Schwartz E. Rietdorf J. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4522-4529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complex formation was either monitored by in-gel hydrogenase activity staining (19Bernhard M. Schwartz E. Rietdorf J. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4522-4529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by protein staining using Coomassie Blue. Nickel and iron were determined with a Hitachi 180-80 polarized Zeeman atomic absorption spectrophotometer against a standard series. Samples were made devoid of extraneous metal ions by passage over a Chelex-100 column (Bio-Rad). Hydrogen uptake activity was measured amperometrically at 30 °C in a cell (2.15 ml) with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, using a Clark-type electrode (YSI 5331) according to Coremans et al. (20Coremans J.M.C.C. Van der Zwaan J.W. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 997: 256-267Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As O2 did not affect the activity, no efforts were made to remove air. Hydrogen, in the form of H2-saturated water, was added to final concentrations varying from 36 to 100 μm. As electron acceptor either benzyl viologen (4.2 mm, Em = -359 mV) or methylene blue (4 mm,Em, pH 7 = +11 mV) were used. The measured specific activities were plotted against the H2concentration. The dependence was simulated using the program Leonora by Cornish-Bowden, assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics (21Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 133-189Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in the assay were typically 2.5–5 nm RH (α2β2). Benzyl viologen-dependent H2 evolution was determined amperometrically at 30 °C. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm acetate buffer, 1 mm benzyl viologen, and 3 mm sodium dithionite. D+/H+ exchange activity was measured in a stirred membrane leak chamber fitted to a mass spectrometer (Masstorr 200 DX quadrupole, VG Quadrupoles Ltd.). Two different assays were used. In the first assay 10 ml of Mes/Mops/Tris buffer solution (ionic strength 90 mm; pH 6.5) was saturated with 20% D2 and 80% argon, and 1 μmol of sodium dithionite was added to eliminate residual oxygen. The reaction was started by the addition of RH (α2β2) to a final concentration of 0.12 μm. Masses 1–6 were scanned at 1 atomic mass unit/s. In the second assay the buffer solution was in 99.9% D2O (Aldrich) and saturated with H2. A control experiment was done in D2/D2O in order to evaluate the HD production catalyzed by the protein due to contaminant H+. This effect was subtracted to the H2/D2O assay. The pD of the assay mixtures was measured with a glass electrode calibrated with pH standards in H2O. It was taken into account that pD = pH + 0.41 (22Covington A.K. Paabo M. Robinson R.A. Bates R.G. Anal. Chem. 1968; 40: 700-706Crossref Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 23Quinn D.M. Sutton L.D. Cook P.F. Enzyme Mechanism from Isotope Effects. CRC, Boca Raton, FL1991: 73-126Google Scholar). All experiments were done at 30 °C. X-band (9.4 GHz) spectra with a 100 kHz field modulation frequency were recorded on a Bruker ECS106 EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR900 helium flow cryostat with an ITC4 temperature controller. The magnetic field was calibrated with an AEG Magnetic Field Meter. The frequency was measured with a Hewlett-Packard 5350B Microwave Frequency Counter. Illumination of the samples was performed by shining white light (Osram Halogen Bellaphot, 150 watts) via a light guide through the irradiation grid of the Bruker ER 4102 ST cavity. Spectra were simulated according to the formulas published by Beinert and Albracht (24Beinert H. Albracht S.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 245-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were taken on a Bio-Rad FTS 60A spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector. Spectra were recorded at room temperature with a resolution of 2 cm−1. Typically, averages of 1524 spectra were taken against proper blanks. Enzyme samples (10 μl) were loaded into a gas-tight transmission cell (CaF2, 56 μm path length). The spectra were corrected for the base line using a spline function provided by the Bio-Rad software. Optical spectra were taken on an Aminco DW-2000 spectrophotometer interfaced with an IBM computer. To avoid interferences with the dominant activities of the MBH and the SH, we started the purification of the RH protein with mutant R. eutrophaHF371, in which the MBH and SH genes had been deleted by mutation. After cell disruption and high speed centrifugation, the soluble extract was incubated at 65 °C for 10 min under an atmosphere of H2 (100%). The heat treatment was necessary prior to high resolution hydrophobic interaction chromatography to provide an effective and rapid isolation of the RH. Purification to apparent homogeneity was achieved by subsequent anion exchange chromatography. The total procedure is summarized in TableI. Beginning with 83 g of cells (wet weight), 10.9 mg of RH was obtained. The specific activity of the preparation was 0.94 units/mg of protein with methylene blue as the electron acceptor. The H2 concentration in the assay was 57.8 μm. The protein was purified 26-fold with a yield of 6%.Table IPurification of the R. eutropha regulatory hydrogenaseStepaThe individual steps are described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.”Total proteinTotal activitySpecific activityRecoveryPurificationmgunitsunits/mg%-foldSoluble extract4676168.50.036100Heat treatment173483.30.04849.41.3(NH4)2SO4162079.40.04947.11.4ET column34.823.40.67313.918.7HQ column10.910.30.9426.126.2a The individual steps are described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Two protein bands occurred after denaturing the RH by SDS-PAGE corresponding to molecular masses of 37 and 55 kDa, respectively (Fig.1 A). These values are in good agreement with those predicted from the nucleotide sequence ofhoxB (36.5 kDa) and hoxC (52.4 kDa). The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis, using an antibody raised against the HoxC subunit of the RH (Fig.1 B). Analysis of the enzyme on a Superdex G-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) revealed a single peak corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼165 kDa (data not shown) indicating that the RH was purified as a tetramer with an α2β2 structure. Atomic absorption spectroscopy showed an average metal content of 11.2 iron/nickel. After Chelex treatment this ratio decreased to 7.6 iron/nickel. The activity after the Chelex-100 column was 75% of the initial activity. The oxidation of H2 by the purified RH turned out to be O2-insensitive. The level of activity was the same in aerobic and anaerobic buffers. Moreover, the rate of H2oxidation determined with methylene blue as the electron acceptor did not show the typical lag phase that is found with most as isolated [NiFe]-hydrogenases. This observation is consistent with the result obtained with soluble extract (17Pierik A. Schmelz M. Lenz O. Friedrich B. Albracht S.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Km for H2 was 25 ± 5 μm, and the calculated specific activity at Vmax conditions was 1.2 ± 0.2 units/mg of protein. The activity of the RH remained constant over a broad pH range between 5 and 10 irrespective of the used buffers (potassium acetate, K-PO4, and Tris-HCl; 50 mm each), whereas most hydrogenases show a distinct pH optimum. In contrast to the H2 uptake activity, the production of H2 by the RH was pH-dependent. Highest H2 evolution rates (0.8 units/mg of protein) were obtained at pH 4.0 with benzyl viologen as electron donor. Acetylene has been shown to be a competitive inhibitor for several hydrogenases (25Hyman M.R. Arp D.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6447-6454Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Zorin N.A. Dimon B. Gagnon J. Gaillard J. Carrier P. Vignais P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Incubation of the RH with C2H2 did not affect the RH activity (data not shown). Storage of the purified RH at 4 °C under air or an atmosphere of 100% O2 resulted in a loss of 50% of the H2-dependent methylene blue-reducing activity within 48 h. Replacement of the air atmosphere by 100% argon or N2 caused a decrease of 20% of the activity within the same period. Addition of metal ions (Fe3+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) or glycerol (20%) or addition of KCl up to 0.5m did not affect the stability of the RH. The supply of dithionite or ferricyanide under anoxic conditions also did not contribute to the stability of the RH. Moreover, storage of the isolated RH under an atmosphere of 100% H2 inactivated the RH rapidly; 50% of its activity disappeared within 12 h. The H2 sensitivity contrasts with data obtained with the soluble extract, which showed constant RH activity over a period of 24 h under comparable conditions. In all cases inactivation of the RH was irreversible. The D+/H+ exchange assay with the RH yielded only H2 production but no HD formation (Fig.2 A). The initial rate of H2 production at pH 6.5 was 2.1 ± 0.1 units/mg of protein. This behavior is distinct from that of other [NiFe]-hydrogenases, which show higher initial rates of HD production than of H2 production. When the exchange activity assay was measured in deuterated water saturated with H2 some HD production was detected with the RH, although the rate of D2 evolution was definitively higher (Fig. 2 B). The initial rate of D2 production at pD 6.5 was 1.3 ± 0.2 units/mg of protein, whereas the initial rate of HD production was 0.5 ± 0.1 units/mg of protein. The pH optimum of the D+/H+ exchange activity of the RH was at pH 5.5 (data not shown). Preliminary studies of the RH in crude cell extracts prohibited a study of the EPR properties of its Fe-S clusters (17Pierik A. Schmelz M. Lenz O. Friedrich B. Albracht S.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme now allowed this approach. The as isolated RH showed no EPR signals at temperatures between 4.2 and 100 K. Also after addition of the oxidizing agent DCIP (dichlorophenolindophenol, Em = +230 mV), no signal occurred. Upon reduction of the RH (15 min under 100% H2at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), a rhombic EPR signal with g values at 2.19, 2.13, and 2.01 appeared (Fig.3, trace A). The double-integrated intensity of the signal amounted to a spin concentration equal to 69% of the nickel concentration. The EPR signal is very similar to the well studied Nia-C* signal observed in standard hydrogenases (e.g. fromDesulfovibrio gigas and Allochromatium vinosum), and it is due to a paramagnetic state of the active site nickel in the 3+ state (27Happe R.P. Roseboom W. Albracht S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A typical feature of enzyme in the Nia-C* state is its light sensitivity at cryogenic temperatures, yielding the so-called Nia-L* signal as a result of the photodissociation of a hydrogen (28Van der Zwaan J.W. Albracht S.P.J. Fontijn R.D. Mul P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A model for this photodissociation has been described by Happe et al.(27Happe R.P. Roseboom W. Albracht S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the case of the RH the Nia-C* signal also showed this light-sensitive behavior. Upon illumination at 30 K a spectrum (Nia-L*: gxyz = 2.045, 2.09, and 2.24), only slightly different from the Nia-L* signal of standard hydrogenases, appeared (Fig. 3, trace B). The small difference concerns the position of the gz (2.24 in the RH as compared with 2.28/2.30 in standard [NiFe] hydrogenases). This points to a small structural difference around the active site nickel. Upon warming of the sample to 200 K for 15 min in the dark a third, transient, spectrum came up with g values at 2.047, 2.069, and 2.30 (Fig. 3, trace C). Only after several hours at 200 K the sample returned to the Nia-C* state. Contrary to observations in standard [NiFe]-hydrogenases no signal of a [3Fe-4S]+ cluster could be observed in the oxidized protein, not even after treatment with excess DCIP. This is in agreement with the presence of three [4Fe-4S] clusters as predicted from the amino acid sequence data. When the protein was treated with 100% H2, however, no signals due to reduced cubanes were detectable, not even if 20 mm dithionite was added. None of the nickel signals (Nia-C*, Nia-L*, or the transient signal) showed any spin coupling due to a reduced proximal [4Fe-4S] cluster (Fig. 3). This indicates that this cluster was in the oxidized, diamagnetic state in the RH under H2. In standard [NiFe]-hydrogenases the proximal cluster is usually reduced under 100% H2. The interaction of the nickel with the reduced proximal cluster is observed as a clear 2-fold splitting of the Nia-C* signal at 4.5 K. At low temperatures it was also possible to completely saturate the Nia-C* signal at high microwave power (260 milliwatts), which is again indicative of an oxidized proximal cluster (28Van der Zwaan J.W.

Reduction of the RH with dithionite in the presence or absence of low potential electron acceptors (methyl viologen and benzyl viologen) under 100% H2 did not evoke any signal of a reduced Fe-S cluster. Also inspection of the integrated EPR signals did not uncover any broad signal due to reduced Fe-S clusters as can be seen in the right-hand panel in Fig. 3for the Nia-L* signal. The FTIR measurements on purified RH confirmed the presence of only two redox states described earlier to be present in the RH from soluble extracts (17Pierik A. Schmelz M. Lenz O. Friedrich B. Albracht S.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Untreated protein showed a spectrum (Fig. 4 A) with two small bands (2082 and 2071 cm−1) and one large band (1943 cm−1) in the 2150–1850 cm−1 spectral region. This EPR-silent state of the active RH resembles the Nia-S state of standard [NiFe]-hydrogenases. Maximal reduction, already obtained after a few minutes under 100% H2 at room temperature, yielded the Nia-C* state (Fig. 4 C) as identified previously in other [NiFe]-hydrogenases (30Bagley K.A. Duin E.C. Roseboom W. Albracht S.P. Woodruff W.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5527-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 31De Lacey A.L. Hatchikian E.C. Volbeda A. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Fernandez V.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7181-7189Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This state showed a CO stretch vibration at 1960 cm−1. The two bands at 2082 and 2071 cm−1, which did not shift, are ascribed to the symmetrical and antisymmetrical coupled vibrations of two cyanides bound to iron in the active site (17Pierik A. Schmelz M. Lenz O. Friedrich B. Albracht S.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was not possible to reduce further this state by adding excess dithionite (20 mm, spectrum not shown). When the gas phase was changed from 100% H2 to 100% CO (equilibration time 60 min) a mixture of the Nia-C* and Nia-S state was observed (Fig. 4 B). The spectrum clearly showed that it was not possible for exogenous CO to bind to the active site of the RH since no extra peak around 2060 cm−1 could be seen. Such a band from added CO is observed in the A. vinosum and D. gigasenzyme 3De Lacey, A.L., and Fernandez, V.M., unpublished results. (32Bagley K.A. Van Garderen C.J. Chen M. Duin E.C. Albracht S.P. Woodruff W.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9229-9236Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A similar change was observed by replacing H2 with argon (results not shown). Upon complete oxidation with excess DCIP (2 mm) the sample returned to the Nia-S state. UV-visible spectra of oxidized and reduced RH showed differences in absorption between the two species. Incubation of the RH under 100% H2 resulted in an increase in absorption in the 250–280 and 300–400 nm spectral regions (Fig. 5). The difference spectrum of reduced minus oxidized RH showed a large peak at 251 nm and a smaller one at 342 nm with an apparent shoulder at 305 nm. The calculated ε251 was 11.96 mm−1 cm−1based on protein concentration. Similarly the ε342 was calculated to be 5.36 mm−1cm−1. The protein concentration used (0.64 mg/ml) was such that the absorption at 280 nm was about 1.0. At this intensity the detector is still sensitive enough to pick up reliable differences in the UV, meaning that these are not due to mismatching in this region. To elucidate the nature of the interaction between the RH and the signa"
https://openalex.org/W1965788962,"A purple acid phosphatase from sweet potato is the first reported example of a protein containing an enzymatically active binuclear Fe-Mn center. Multifield saturation magnetization data over a temperature range of 2 to 200 K indicates that this center is strongly antiferromagnetically coupled. Metal ion analysis shows an excess of iron over manganese. Low temperature EPR spectra reveal only resonances characteristic of high spin Fe(III) centers (Fe(III)-apo and Fe(III)-Zn(II)) and adventitious Cu(II) centers. There were no resonances from either Mn(II) or binuclear Fe-Mn centers. Together with a comparison of spectral properties and sequence homologies between known purple acid phosphatases, the enzymatic and spectroscopic data strongly indicate the presence of catalytic Fe(III)-Mn(II) centers in the active site of the sweet potato enzyme. Because of the strong antiferromagnetism it is likely that the metal ions in the sweet potato enzyme are linked via a μ-oxo bridge, in contrast to other known purple acid phosphatases in which a μ-hydroxo bridge is present. Differences in metal ion composition and bridging may affect substrate specificities leading to the biological function of different purple acid phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W1486164103,"Rab GTPases function as regulatory components of an evolutionarily conserved machinery that mediates docking, priming, and fusion of vesicles with intracellular membranes. We have previously shown that the active conformation of Rab3A is stabilized by a substantial hydrophobic interface between the putative conformational switch regions (Dumas, J. J., Zhu, Z., Connolly, J. L., and Lambright, D. G. (1999) Structure 7, 413-423). A triad of invariant hydrophobic residues at this switch interface (Phe-59, Trp-76, and Tyr-91) represents a major interaction determinant between the switch regions of Rab3A and the Rab3A-specific effector Rabphilin3A (Ostermeier, C., and Brunger, A. T. (1999) Cell 96, 363-374). Here, we report the crystal structure of the active form of Rab5C, a prototypical endocytic Rab GTPase. As is true for Rab3A, the active conformation of Rab5C is stabilized by a hydrophobic interface between the switch regions. However, the conformation of the invariant hydrophobic triad (residues Phe-58, Trp-75, and Tyr-90 in Rab5C) is dramatically altered such that the resulting surface is noncomplementary to the switch interaction epitope of Rabphilin3A. This structural rearrangement reflects a set of nonconservative substitutions in the hydrophobic core between the central beta sheet and the alpha2 helix. These observations demonstrate that structural plasticity involving an invariant hydrophobic triad at the switch interface contributes to the mechanism by which effectors recognize distinct Rab subfamilies. Thus, the active conformation of the switch regions conveys information about the identity of a particular Rab GTPase as well as the state of the bound nucleotide."

In this study, we sought to identify components of the cell surface of a vertical growth phase melanoma cell line, WM1341D, that mediate invasive cellular behavior. We determined by antisense inhibition that melanoma chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (MCSP) and membrane-type 3 matrix metalloproteinase (MT3-MMP) expressed on WM1341D are required for invasion of type I collagen and degradation of type I gelatin. MT3-MMP co-immunoprecipitated with MCSP in WM1341D melanoma cells cultured on type I collagen or laminin. The association between MT3-MMP and MCSP was largely disrupted by removing chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (CS) from the cell surface, suggesting CS could mediate the association between the two cell surface core proteins.

Attempts to Understand Metastasis Formation. 213 (part 1). Springer, New York1996: 65-80Google Scholar). Melanoma progression from radial growth phase to vertical growth phase (VGP) is characterized in part by enhanced invasion into the surrounding dermis (2Herlyn M Tumor Progression in the Melanocytic System. R. G. Landes Company, Georgetown1993Google Scholar). Invasion requires that tumor cells bind to and degrade ECM components within the dermal/epidermal junction (i.e. basal lamina containing type IV collagen) and the dermis (rich in types I and III collagen). Many studies have documented the importance of adhesion receptors such as integrins and cell surface proteoglycans in melanoma cell invasion through basement membrane or into type I collagen matrices in vitro (3Etoh T.

Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that certain cell adhesion receptors (e.g.αvβ3 integrin and CD44) interact with proteolytic enzymes on cell surfaces, and these interactions facilitate proteolysis of ECM proteins and cell migration and/or invasion (8Wei Y.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that at least one consequence of integrin/protease interaction on the surface of tumors may be to focus the delivery of extracellular matrix-degrading proteases, allowing for the fine control of ECM degradation and tumor invasion. Melanoma chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (MCSP) is a cell surface proteoglycan expressed relatively early in melanoma progression (12Reisfeld R.A. Cheresh D.A. Adv. Immunol. 1987; 40: 323-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and MCSP has been implicated in the malignant properties of advanced melanoma. Melanoma adhesion to endothelial cells and chemotactic responses to fibronectin are inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed against the MCSP core protein (13De Vries J.E. Keizer G.D. Te Velde A.A. Voordouw A. Ruiter D. Rumke P. Spits H. Figdor C.G. Int. J. Cancer. 1986; 38: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and MCSP has been associated with melanoma invasion in vitro (14Chattopadhyay P. Starky J. Morrow W.J. Raychaudhuri S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2684-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that mouse melanoma cells transfected with NG2 (the rat homologue of human MCSP) are more tumorigenic and metastatic than control counterparts in vivo(15Burg M.A. Grako K.A. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanisms by which MCSP may facilitate metastasis are unknown, we have previously demonstrated that MCSP can enhance ligand binding by α4β1 integrin, and MCSP activation can enhance integrin-mediated cell spreading by cdc42- and p130cas-dependent mechanisms, indicating that MCSP can directly transduce signals important for tumor adhesion and extravasation (16Iida J.

Thus, MCSP may be involved at multiple discrete but overlapping steps in tumor progression, acting through several distinct mechanisms to enhance melanoma invasion and metastasis. Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs) comprise a family of transmembrane metalloproteinases that regulate proteolysis of ECM proteins at the plasma membrane (19Sato H. Okada Y. Seiki M. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). MT-MMPs degrade various ECM proteins (i.e. collagens, fibronectin, and laminin) and proteolytically activate gelatinase A (MMP-2) on the cell surface. The localization of MT-MMPs within the plasma membrane uniquely situates them in position to promote tumor invasion (19Sato H. Okada Y. Seiki M. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP is highly expressed in cancerous tissues compared with tissues that are either normal or contain benign tumors (20Kitagawa Y. Kunimi K. Ito H. Sato H. Uchibayashi T. Okada Y. Seiki M.

Yamashita K. Shimada T. Yamamoto E. Noguchi M. Fujimoto N. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of MT1-MMP stimulates tumor cell invasion through basement membranes, and it has been immunolocalized within cell-to-ECM adhesion sites (25Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar,26Nakahara H. Howard L. Thompson E.W. Sato H. Seiki M. Yeh Y.Y. Chen W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7959-7964Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP has been shown to directly degrade type I collagen and to activate MMP-2 and MMP-13 (collagenase-3) (27Kanuper V. Will H. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B. Atkinson A. Stanton H. Hembry R. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17124-17131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), indicating that it may facilitate tumor invasion by acting on multiple substrates. As a result, MT1-MMP could facilitate the degradation of denatured and native collagen fibers in the vicinity of invading tumors. Recent studies show that MT1-MMP and MMP-2 are expressed at the tumor-stroma interface at the invasive front of primary melanomas (28Airola K. Karonen T. Vaalamo M. lehti K. Kariniemi A.-L. Keski-Oja J. Saarialho-Kere U. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), suggesting these enzymes may be linked in promoting melanoma progression and invasion into surrounding tissues. MT3-MMP, a related transmembrane type MMP, has been identified in malignant oral melanoma cells (29Takino T. Sato H. Shinagawa A. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23013-23020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) but not in breast or thyroid cancer cells (22Ueno H. Nakamura H. Inoue M. Imai K. Noguchi M. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2055-2260PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nakamura H. Ueno H. Yamashita K. Shimada T. Yamamoto E. Noguchi M. Fujimoto N. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). Although purified MT3-MMP degrades various ECM proteins, including denatured collagen, it is relatively ineffective at degrading native type I collagen (30Shimada T. Nakamura H. Ohuchi E. Fujii Y. Murakami Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The potential role of MT3-MMP in tumor invasion and proteolysis has not been studied. In this study, we have used antisense mRNA inhibition to demonstrate that both MCSP and MT3-MMP are critical factors for promoting the invasion of WM1341D VGP melanoma cells into type I collagen gels in vitro. Co-immunoprecipitation was employed to identify an association between MCSP and MT3-MMP through chondroitin sulfate (CS). Recombinant MT3-MMP was able to bind directly to CS affinity columns, suggesting that MCSP may specifically localize MT3-MMP to ECM adhesion sites on the surface of melanoma cells. Finally, removal of cell surface CS resulted in impaired type I collagen degradation by adherent tumor cells. These results suggest that MCSP may facilitate the invasion of aggressive primary tumors within the dermis by enhancing the local concentration and/or activation of specific MMPs at sites of contact between melanoma cells and the underlying ECM. The vertical growth phase (VGP) human melanoma cell line WM1341D was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS (31Hsu M.Y. Elder D.E. Herlyn M. Masters J.R.W. Palsson B.

Anti-MT1-MMP mAb (IM57L: clone 113–57B), anti-MT2-MMP polyclonal antibody (catalogue number 475930), and anti-MT4-MMP polyclonal antibody (catalogue number 475934) were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Anti-MT3-MMP polyclonal antibody was generated in rabbit as described previously (36Kang T. Ti J. Yang W. Wang X. Jiang A. Pei D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The specificities of anti-MT1-MMP and anti-MT3-MMP antibodies were determined by immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion assays using MDCK cells transfected with MT1-MMP or MT3-MMP. Biotinylated anti-FLAG mAb was purchased from Sigma. Full-length human brain MT3-MMP was ligated in pCR3.1-uni (Invitrogen) (36Kang T. Ti J. Yang W. Wang X. Jiang A. Pei D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The MT3-MMP-encoding fragment (1300 bp) was liberated byEcoRI/HindIII digestion and subcloned in antisense orientation via HindIII/EcoRI into pBKRSV. Melanoma cells were transfected with this plasmid, termed pBKRSV(MT3AS), using Lipofectin according to manufacturer's protocol. Transfectants were selected by culturing in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418, and characterized for MT3-MMP expression by using specific anti-MT3-MMP antibodies in immunoprecipitation (see text). Antisense oligos for human MCSP were synthesized based on previously reported sequence information (37Pluschke G. Vanek M. Evans A. Dittmar T. Schmid P. Itin P. Filardo E.J. Reisfeld R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9710-9715Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Antisense MCSP (5′-AAGTGGGGGGCCGCGGCCGGACTGCAT-3′) and sense MCSP (5′-ATGCAGTCCGGCCGCGGCCCCCCACTT-3′) oligos were synthesized by the Microchemical Facility (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). These oligos were incubated with melanoma cells as described below without any chemical modification. To inhibit MCSP expression on melanoma cells, melanoma cells were cultured with 30 μmsense or antisense MCSP oligo for 48 h, with fresh doses given every 12 h, prior to assays and oligos were included during assays. The effectiveness of antisense MCSP oligo on expression of the antigen was measured by flow cytometry using 9.2.27 (see “Results” section). Expression of MCSP, CD44, and integrins was measured by FACS analysis as described previously (5Knutson J.R. Iida J. Fields G.B. McCarthy J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 1 ml of cell suspension were incubated with 1 μg/ml mAbs for 30 min at 4 °C with tapping of samples every 5 min. Cells were washed three times with the FACS buffer (RPMI 1640 containing 1% heat-inactivated goat serum, 20 mm HEPES, and 0.02% NaN3) and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (final dilution of 1:500) at 4 °C for 30 min. The titers of the primary and the secondary mAbs were maximized under these experimental conditions. Cells were washed three times with the FACS buffer and resuspended in 200 μl of PBS containing 2% formaldehyde. Cells were analyzed on a FACS Star (Becton-Dickinson). Migration assays were performed in modified Boyden chambers (Neuroprobe, Bethesda, MD) with 8-μm pore size polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore, Pleasanton, CA) as described previously (5Knutson J.R. Iida J. Fields G.B. McCarthy J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Melanoma cells were harvested and resuspended in RPMI-SF at a final concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml. Lower wells of the chambers were filled with RPMI-SF containing 20 μg/ml of rat type I collagen. Cells (50 μl of suspension) were added to the upper wells with or without appropriate mAbs or inhibitors in corresponding assays. Migration assays were performed for 4 h at 37 °C. Data are shown as mean number of cells migrated cells ± S.D. per mm2 from one representative experiment. Human melanoma cell invasion was evaluated using type I collagen gels cast in 24-well Transwell culture inserts with 8-μm pore size (catalogue number 3422, Costar). Rat tail type I collagen was diluted in RPMI 1640-serum free (RPMI-SF) to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. 100 μl of the solution was gelled in the upper chamber of 24-well transwells by incubating at 37 °C for 4–5 h. Gels were washed twice with prewarmed RPMI 1640-SF. WM1341D cells were harvested by brief treatment with trypsin/EDTA, washed three times with RPMI 1640–10% FCS, and resuspended in RPMI 1640–1% FCS at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml to ensure the viability of melanoma cells during assay periods. The cell suspension (100 μl) was placed in the upper chamber of each transwell. The lower chambers were filled with 600 μl of RPMI 1640-SF containing 10 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin as an adhesive matrix. The chambers were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C. For inhibiting melanoma cell invasion, MMP inhibitors BB94 (5 μm), rTIMP-1 (50 nm), or rTIMP-2 (50 nm) were added to both the cell suspension and the collagen gel. Polycarbonate membranes were stained with Diff-Quick (Baxter, Miami, FL), and non-invaded cells were scraped from the upper side of the membranes. Invaded cells were visualized microscopically (50×) and counted by randomly selecting three areas from one membrane. Each assay condition was performed in triplicate, and results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) per mm2 from one representative experiment. Cell adhesion assays were performed as described with minor modifications (16Iida J. Skubitz A.P.N. Furcht L.T. Wayner E.A. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, type I collagen was diluted in PBS, and 50-μl aliquots were dispersed in triplicate into Immulon-1 polystyrene microtiter wells. The wells were incubated at 37 °C overnight, and blocked with 200 μl of PBS containing 2% BSA. Subconfluent VGP human melanoma cells radiolabeled overnight with [3H]thymidine (specific activity 6.7 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) were harvested with 1 mm EDTA. The released cells were washed two times with RPMI 1640 containing 2 mg/ml BSA and 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml in the same medium. Aliquots of 100 μl of the cell suspension were dispensed into the wells, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Assays were terminated by aspirating loosely bound and unbound cells from the wells. Bound radioactivity, determined in a Beckman Model 3801 liquid scintillation counter, was used to calculate the percentage of cells that remained adherent. Experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. 96-well plates were coated with 3H-type I collagen (2 × 104dpm/50 μl/well) overnight and then blocked with PBS-BSA. Melanoma cells were harvested by trypsin-EDTA, washed twice with RPMI 1640, and resuspended in RPMI-SF at a density of 2 × 105cells/ml. Aliquots of 100-μl cell suspension were seeded in each well and incubated for 8 h at 37 °C. Cell culture supernatants were then harvested and centrifuged to remove cell debris. Released radioactivity, corresponding to degraded type I collagen, was measured in 50 μl of each supernatant. Under these experimental conditions, over 90% of radioactivity was released into medium by trypsin, suggesting that a large part of type I collagen is denatured as gelatin. We therefore considered these experiments to be type I gelatin degradation assays. For inhibiting proteolysis, BB94 (5 μm), rTIMP-1 (50 nm), or rTIMP-2 (50 nm) was included in the cell suspension. We performed these assays with six replicates/point. Melanoma cells (5 × 106) were cultured in RPMI 1640–1% FBS on Petri dishes coated with 100 μg/ml type I collagen. Cells were harvested with 1 mm EDTA, washed, and labeled with 100 μg/ml of NHS-biotin in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were extensively washed and solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm β-octylglucopyranoside, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NEM, and 1 mm PMSF. Cell lysates were precleared by nonimmune rabbit IgG, isotype-matched IgG-conjugated protein A-Sepharose, and then immunoprecipitated with specific primary antibodies (17Iida J. Meijne A.M.L.

Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Alternatively, unlabeled cells were briefly washed with PBS and then lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1% Brij58, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm NEM, 1 mm PMSF. Cell lysates were precleared and then immunoprecipitated with primary monoclonal antibodies against MCSP (9.2.27), β1 integrin (P2D5), or αvβ3 integrin (LM609). The immunocomplexes were blotted with anti-MT3-MMP antibody followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and detected by ECL. Melanoma cells (5 × 106 cells) were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 containing 1% FBS on Petri dishes coated with 100 μg/ml type I collagen. Cell lysates prepared as described above were immunoprecipitated with anti-MT3-MMP antibody. Beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were released in 50 μl of PBS containing 1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature and diluted in 1 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NEM, 1 mm PMSF. MT3-MMP-associated proteins were re-immunoprecipitated with control isotype-matched IgG, anti-β1 mAb (P5D2), anti-αvβ3mAb (LM609), or anti-MCSP mAb (9.2.27). The beads were then extensively washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NEM, 1 mm PMSF and washed three times with PBS. Bound proteins on the beads were labeled with 1 mmNHS-Biotin for 15 min at 4 °C, because neither anti-β1nor anti-αvβ3 mAb is compatible with Western analysis. The beads were washed with PBS five times to remove NHS-Biotin, and incubated in SDS-sample buffer under reducing conditions to release the proteins from the beads. Blotted proteins were detected with HRP-streptavidin and ECL. CS affinity beads were prepared as described previously (17Iida J. Meijne A.M.L. Oegema T.R.J. Yednock T.A. Kovach N.L. Furcht L.T.

Biotinylated melanoma cell lysates were prepared as for immunoprecipitation, precleared on a mock column, and applied to a CS affinity column. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C and then extensively washed with the lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 50 mmβ-octylglucopyranoside, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm NEM, 1 mm PMSF. Aliquots of eluted protein were separated and detected as described above. Eluted proteins were further immunoprecipitated with anti-MT3-MMP antibody and MT3-MMP was detected as described. MDCK cells were transfected with an expression construct encoding FLAG-tagged MT3-MMP as described previously (36Kang T. Ti J. Yang W. Wang X. Jiang A. Pei D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transfectants were lysed in 100 mmTris-HCl (pH7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.14 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm NEM, and 1 mm PMSF and then incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with lysis buffer containing 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide. The eluted MT3-MMP was incubated with 50 μl (bed volume) of CS beads or mock-activated beads prepared as described above for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in lysis buffer, bound MT3-MMP was released in SDS sample buffer, and blotted with anti-FLAG and HRP-goat anti-mouse IgG. VGP melanoma cells aggressively invade the collagen-rich dermis in vivo as a presage to metastasis. To model this process in vitro, we examined the adhesion, migration, and invasion of WM1341D melanoma cells on type I collagen-coated surfaces. Based on the use of inhibitory anti-integrin antibodies in short-term adhesion or Boyden chamber migration assays, adhesion and migration to type I collagen was determined to depend primarily on α2β1 integrin (and to a lesser extent on α3β1 integrin) (TableI). By contrast, anti-αvβ3 integrin antibodies had no inhibitory effect on melanoma cell adhesion or migration to type I collagen (Table I). The invasion of VGP cells through type I collagen gels was similarly dependent on α2β1integrin, with no detectable involvement of αvβ3 integrin.Table IRelative contribution of integrins in WM1341D melanoma adhesion, migration, and invasion into type 1 collagenInhibition by monoclonal antibodies1-aMelanoma cell adhesion, migration, and invasion of type 1 collagen was assayed in the presence of function-blocking anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies P1E6 (anti-α2β1), P1B5 (anti-α3β1), and LM609 (anti-αvβ3) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”α2β1α3β1αvβ3%Adhesion80125Migration7563Invasion801061-a Melanoma cell adhesion, migration, and invasion of type 1 collagen was assayed in the presence of function-blocking anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies P1E6 (anti-α2β1), P1B5 (anti-α3β1), and LM609 (anti-αvβ3) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab We previously reported that cell surface chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans facilitate melanoma invasion into type I collagen gels and/or basement membrane matrices in vitro (4Faassen A.E.

WM1341D melanoma cells express two cell surface chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core proteins (MCSP and CD44) as evaluated by flow cytometry (Fig. 1, A andD). Both MCSP and CD44 have been implicated in melanoma metastasis, because antibodies generated against either of these cell surface proteoglycans inhibit invasion (5Knutson J.R. Iida J. Fields G.B.

To further assess the importance of MCSP in the invasion of WM1341D cells, we utilized antisense oligonucleotides (oligos) to specifically inhibit expression of the MCSP core protein. Melanoma cells cultured in the presence of sense or antisense MCSP oligos corresponding to the first 27 nucleotides of coding sequence were evaluated by FACS analysis for cell surface expression of MCSP (Fig. 1, A–C), CD44 (Fig.1, D–F)"
https://openalex.org/W2013656398,"Murine multidrug resistance protein 1 (mrp1), unlike human MRP1, does not confer resistance to anthracyclines. Previously, we have shown that a human/murine hybrid protein containing amino acids 959–1187 of MRP1 can confer resistance to these drugs. We have now examined the functional characteristics of mutant proteins in which we have converted individual amino acids in the comparable region of mrp1 to those present at the respective locations in MRP1. These mutations had no effect on the drug resistance profile conferred by mrp1 with the exception of converting glutamine 1086 to glutamate, as it is in the corresponding position (1089) in MRP1. This mutation created a protein that conferred resistance to doxorubicin without affecting vincristine resistance, or the ability of mrp1 to transport leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and 17β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) (E217βG). Furthermore, mutation Q1086D conferred the same phenotype as mutation Q1086E while the mutation Q1086N did not detectably alter the drug resistance profile of mrp1, suggesting that an anionic side chain was required for anthracycline resistance. To confirm the importance of MRP1 E1089 for conferring resistance to anthracyclines, we mutated this residue to Gln, Asp, Ala, Leu, and Lys in the human protein. The mutation E1089D showed the same phenotype as MRP1, while the E1089Q substitution markedly decreased resistance to anthracyclines without affecting LTC4 and E217βG transport. Conversion of Glu-1089 to Asn, Ala, or Leu had a similar effect on resistance to anthracyclines, while conversion to a positive amino acid, Lys, completely eliminated resistance to anthracyclines and vincristine without affecting transport of LTC4, E217βG, and the GSH-dependent substrate, estrone-3-sulfate. These results demonstrate that an acidic amino acid residue at position 1089 in predicted TM14 of MRP1 is critical for the ability of the protein to confer drug resistance particularly to the anthracyclines, but is not essential for its ability to transport conjugated organic anions such as LTC4 and E217βG.

The predicted structures of MRP1 and several of its related proteins differ from that of a typical eukaryotic ATP-binding cassette transporter such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp).

Presently, very little is known of the regions of MRP1 that are important for substrate binding and transport.

In an attempt to expedite identification of amino acid residues important for the transport of hydrophobic drugs and the more hydrophilic organic anion conjugates that are established MRP1 substrates, we have taken advantage of well characterized functional differences between the human and murine orthologs of the protein (31Stride B.D. Valdimarsson G. Gerlach J.H. Wilson G.M. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 962-971PubMed Google Scholar, 32Stride B.D. Grant C.E. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Mol.

The murine ortholog, mrp1, and MRP1 are 87% identical, and both proteins confer resistance toVinca alkaloids and epipodophyllotoxins with apparently similar efficiencies. However, mrp1 fails to confer resistance to any anthracycline that has been tested, including doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and epirubicin. In addition, mrp1 transports 17β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) (E217βG) far less efficiently than MRP1, despite the fact that both proteins transport leukotriene C4(LTC4) with similar kinetic parameters (31Stride B.D.

Previously, we have demonstrated using hybrid human/murine proteins that the COOH-terminal third of MRP1 contains important determinants of the ability to confer anthracycline resistance and to transport E217βG. These studies also identified the region from amino acid 959 to 1187 of MRP1 as being particularly important for anthracycline resistance (33Stride B.D. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22877-22883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used this information to guide the design of point mutations in mrp1 in which variant amino acids in the region between residues 955 and 1184 have been replaced with the corresponding amino acid from MRP1 and vice versa. These mutant human and murine proteins were then stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and the transfectants characterized with respect to their drug resistance profiles and their ability to transport LTC4, E217βG, and, in the case of the human protein, estrone-3-sulfate. The results of these studies identify glutamate 1089 in MRP1 as being critical for the ability to confer resistance to anthracyclines. In contrast, mutations at this location had no detectable effect on the ability to transport either LTC4or E217βG and no effect on the GSH-stimulated transport of estrone-3-sulfate. Culture medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. [3H]LTC4 (38 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, England) and [3H]E217βG (44 Ci/mmol) and [6,7-3H]estrone-3-sulfate (53 Ci/mmol) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Doxorubicin HCl, etoposide (VP-16), and vincristine sulfate were obtained from Sigma, and epirubicin from ICN Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). All mutations were generated using the Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Templates were prepared by cloning ∼1.5–1.7-kilobase pair restriction fragments of human MRP1 or murine mrp1 cDNAs into pGEM-3Zf (Promega). Mutagenesis was then performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using a selection primer 5′-GAG AGT GCA CGA TAT CCG GTG TG-3′ that mutates a unique NdeI site in the vector to an EcoRV restriction site. Oligonucleotides bearing mismatched bases at the residues to be mutated (underlined) were synthesized by Cortec DNA Service Laboratories (Kingston, Canada). They are as follows: mutation mrp1Q955K (5′-GGG CAG GTG AAG CTG TCA GTG-3′), mutation mrp1N961D (5′-CA GTG TAC TGG GAC TAC ATG AAG-3′), mutation mrp1L979M (5′-C TTC CTT TTC ATG TGC AAC CAT G-3′), mutation mrp1L1022S (5′-GCC TTG GGC ATC TCA CAA GGT GCA GC-3′), mutation mrp1F1040L (5′-C GGG GGC ATC TTG GCC TCC CGT C-3′), mutation mrp1R1044C (5′-GCC TCC CGT TGC TTG CAC CTG G-3′), mutation mrp1Y1051H (5′-G GAC CTG CTA CAC AAT GTT CTT CG-3′), mutation mrp1N1052S (5′-C CTG CTA TAC AGT GTT CTT CG-3′), mutation mrp1Y1051H/N1052S (5′-G GAC CTG CTA CAC AGT GTT CTT CG-3′), mutation mrp1S1097N (5′-GGT TCA CTC TTC AAC GTC ATT GGA GC-3′), mutation mrp1V1202C (5′-C ATT GGA GCT TGC ATC ATC ATC C-3′), mutation mrp1Q1086E (5′-C TCC ATG ATC CCG GAG GTC ATC-3′), mutation mrp1Q1086D (5′-C TCC ATG ATC CCG GAT GTC ATC-3′), mutation mrp1Q1086N (5′-C TCC ATG ATC CCG GAA GTC ATC-3′), mutation MRP1E1089Q (5′-C TCC ATG ATC CCG CAG GTC ATC-3′), mutation MRP1E1089D (5′-C TCC ATG ATC CCG GAT GTC ATC-3′), mutation MRP1E1089A (5′-C TCC ATG ATC CCG GCG GTC ATC-3′), mutation MRP1E1089L (5′-C TCC ATG ATC CCG CTG GTC ATC-3′), mutation MRP1E1089K (5′-C TCC ATG ATC CCG AAG GTC ATC-3′). The double and triple mutants were also generated by this method. The Q955K/N961D double mutation used the N961D mutagenic primer with the cDNA containing Q955K mutation as a template. Similarly, the L979M/F1040L double mutation used the L979M mutagenic primer with cDNA containing F1040L mutation as a template. The R1944C/Y1051H/N1052S triple mutation used the R1044C mutagenic primer with the cDNA containing Y1051H/N1052S mutation as a template. After confirming all mutations by DNA Thermo Sequenase Cy5.5 and Cy5.0 dye terminator cycle sequencing (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions, DNA fragments containing the desired mutations were transferred into pCEBV7-mrp1 or pCEBV7-MRP1(4, 31–33). After reconstructing the mutations into the respective full-length clones, the integrity of the entire mutated inserts and cloning sites was verified by DNA sequencing. Stable transfection of HEK293 cells with the pCEBV7 vector containing the wild type MRP1 cDNAs or wild type mrp1 cDNAs has been described previously (32Stride B.D. Grant C.E. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). All of the mutated MRP1 or mrp1 constructs were analyzed as stably transfected HEK293 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Laval, Quebec). Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected with pCEBV7 vectors containing mutant MRP1 or mrp1 cDNAs using Fugene6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After ∼48 h, the transfected cells were supplemented with fresh medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. Approximately 3 weeks after transfection, the hygromycin B-resistant cells were cloned by limiting dilution and the resulting cell lines tested for high level expression of the mutant proteins. Plasma membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (15Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol.

After determination of protein levels by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), 2 μg of membrane protein were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% gel) and subsequently transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by electroblotting. MRP1/mrp1 proteins were identified using the monoclonal antibody, MRPr1, which cross-reacts with murine and human mrp1/MRP1 protein (34Hipfner D.R. Gao M. Scheffer G. Scheper R.J. Deeley R.G.

Antibody binding was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Pierce), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Approximately 5 × 105stably-transfected HEK293 cells were seeded in each well of a six-well tissue culture dish on coverslips coated with 0.1% gelatin. When the cells had grown to confluence, they were washed once in PBS for 10 min and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Cells were permeabilized using digitonin (0.25 mg/ml in PBS) for 10 min, treated with a blocking solution of 1% BSA in PBS for 10 min, and then followed by 1-h incubation in blocking solution containing 10 μg/ml RNase A and an antibody against MRP1. Antibodies used were a 1:5000 dilution of mAb QCRL-1, which recognizes amino acids 918–924 in the cytoplasmic connector region of MRP1, or a 1:5000 dilution of mAb MRPm6, which reacts with an epitope close to the COOH terminus of MRP1 (amino acids 1510–1520) (34Hipfner D.R.

After washing with blocking solution for 10 min, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Fab′)2 fragment for 1 h, washed with block solution for 10 min, and then incubated in propidium iodide (2% in H2O) for 5 min. Coverslips were mounted on the slides with one drop of Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Localization of MRP1 in the transfected cells was determined using a Meridian Insight confocal microscope (filter, 620/40 nm for propidium iodide and 530/30 nm for Fluor 488). Drug resistance was determined using the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described previously (4Cole S.P.C. Sparks K.E. Fraser K. Loe D.W.

The following day, various concentrations of drug diluted in culture medium were added to cells (100 μl/well). After incubation for an additional 72 h, 100 μl of medium was removed from each well and the MTT reagent (25 μl/well, 2 mg/ml) (Sigma) was added. After 3 h, the formazan was solubilized by mixing with HCl/isopropanol (1:24) (100 μl/well). Color density was determined using the ELX 800 UV spectrophotometer (Filter4, 570 nm). Mean values of quadruplicate determinations (± S.D.) were plotted using GraphPad software. IC50 values were obtained from the best fit of the data to a sigmoidal curve. Relative resistance is expressed as the ratio of the IC50 value of cells transfected with MRP1 and mrp1 expression vectors compared with cells transfected with empty vector. Resistance was determined in three or more independent experiments. Plasma membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously, and ATP-dependent transport of [3H]LTC4 into the inside-out membrane vesicles was measured by a rapid filtration technique (15Loe D.W.

Briefly, vesicles (2.5 μg of protein) were incubated at 23 °C in 25 μl of transport buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.4) containing 4 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and [3H]LTC4 (50 nm, 25 nCi). At 1 min, 20-μl aliquots were removed and added to 1 ml of ice-cold transport buffer, followed by filtration under vacuum through glass fiber filters (type A/E, Gelman Sciences, Dorval, Quebec, Canada). Filters were immediately washed twice with 5 ml of cold transport buffer and then dried before the bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. All data were corrected for the amount of [3H]LTC4 that remained bound to the filter in the absence of vesicle protein (usually <5% of the total radioactivity). [3H]LTC4 uptake was expressed relative to the protein concentration of the membrane vesicles.Km and Vmax values were determined by measuring ATP-dependent uptake at various concentrations of LTC4, under identical conditions, followed by non-linear regression analyses. ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]E217βG (400 nm, 30 nCi) was measured as described for [3H]LTC4 except that 5 μg of vesicle protein was used and the reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 2 min for preliminary analyses and with various concentrations of [3H]E217βG for 1 min to determine kinetic parameters. ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]estrone-3-sulfate (75 nm-16 μm) was measured as described for [3H]LTC4 except that the reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 1 min in the presence or absence of 1 mm GSH. Previous studies with hybrid human and murine proteins indicated that sequence differences between mrp1 and MRP1 in the region between amino acids 955 and 1184 of the murine protein contributed to its inability to confer resistance to anthracyclines (33Stride B.D.

This region includes predicted TM helices 12–15 and cytoplasmic loop (CL) 7 (Fig.1). Within the predicted α-helices, there are 12 amino acid differences between the human and murine proteins and, of these, 5 are non-conservative. Each of the non-conserved amino acids in mrp1 was replaced individually with the corresponding residue from MRP1. An additional seven sequence differences are present in predicted cytoplasmic residues in this region. Of the seven, five are non-conservative and each of these was also replaced with the corresponding amino acid from the human protein. In addition to the single substitutions, selected double and triple mutations were made as indicated in TableI.Table IRelative drug resistance of HEK293 cells transfected with wild type and mutant murine mrp1TransfectantIC50Relative resistance factorVincristineDoxorubicinVincristineDoxorubicinnmμmHEKpC74.57 ± 0.850.059 ± 0.00411HEKmrp184.45 ± 11.700.047 ± 0.00518.4 ± 2.6<1HEKmrp1Q955K89.19 ± 16.130.047 ± 0.00319.4 ± 3.5<1HEKmrp1N961D79.22 ± 9.200.041 ± 0.00517.3 ± 2.0<1HEKmrp1Q955K/N961D81.45 ± 10.200.045 ± 0.00717.8 ± 2.2<1HEKmrp1L1022S77.08 ± 6.600.058 ± 0.00616.8 ± 1.5<1HEKmrp1F1040L89.32 ± 10.200.051 ± 0.00619.5 ± 2.2<1HEKmrp1L979M/F1040L75.14 ± 9.500.066 ± 0.00716.4 ± 2.11.1HEKmrp1R1044C87.47 ± 9.380.060 ± 0.00719.1 ± 2.11HEKmrp1Y1051H75.68 ± 10.950.043 ± 0.00716.5 ± 2.4<1HEKmrp1N1052S72.96 ± 9.690.059 ± 0.00715.9 ± 2.11HEKmrp1R1044C/Y1051H/N1052S82.56 ± 10.500.060 ± 0.00818.0 ± 2.31HEKmrp1S1097N83.23 ± 11.350.059 ± 0.00618.2 ± 2.51HEKmrp1V1102C82.58 ± 9.870.067 ± 0.00518.0 ± 2.21HEKmrp1Q1086N92.23 ± 8.460.037 ± 0.00420.0 ± 1.9<1HEKmrp1Q1086E73.32 ± 12.280.271 ± 0.04416.0 ± 2.74.6 ± 0.7HEKmrp1Q1086D81.62 ± 14.650.249 ± 0.03617.8 ± 3.24.2 ± 0.6The resistance of HEK293 cells transfected with expression vectors encoding wild type and mutant murine mrp1 relative to that of cells transfected with empty vector was determined using a tetrazolium salt-based microtiter plate assay.

The values shown represent the mean ± S.D. of IC50 values determined from three to six independent experiments. The episomal expression vector, pCEBV7, containing mutated forms of full-length mrp1 and MRP1 cDNAs was used to stably transfect HEK293 cells. From the initial populations of transfectants, we isolated subpopulations by limiting cell dilution that, based on immunoblotting, expressed levels of each mutant protein were approximately equivalent to the levels of wild type mrp1 and MRP1 in previously characterized HEK transfectants. The only exceptions were HEK 293 subpopulations expressing mrp1Q1086N. This mutant protein reached levels that were slightly higher than those in the other subpopulations used. The levels of mrp1 and MRP1 mutant proteins used in studies described below, relative to the respective wild type protein, were determined by immunoblotting with mAb MRPr1, which reacts with both murine and human MRP1(34), followed by densitometry (Fig.2). Endogenous MRP1 in HEK293 cells transfected with the empty vector was undetectable under the conditions used (data not shown). The relative resistance of transfectants expressing each of the mrp1 mutant proteins was determined by MTT assays following exposure to various concentrations of vincristine and doxorubicin. The results are summarized as IC50 values and as relative resistance factors (Table I). None of the mutations significantly affected the level of resistance conferred to vincristine. The only mutation that affected doxorubicin resistance was the conversion of glutamine 1086 to glutamate (Q1086E), as it is at the corresponding position, 1089, in MRP1. The introduction of glutamate resulted in a relative resistance to doxorubicin of 4–5-fold, as did mutation of this residue to aspartate (Q1086D). In contrast, a conservative mutation to asparagine (Q1086N) had no effect (Table I). Typical survival curves for transfectants expressing wild type mrp1 and the mutant proteins Q1086E, Q1086D, and Q1086N are shown in Fig. 3. These results clearly indicate the importance of the residue at this position in influencing substrate specificity and suggest that a negatively charged side chain may be an importa"

Interactions between ERBB2/HER2 and Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine binding domain signaling proteins have been extensively studied. We have identified ERBIN and PICK1 as new binding partners for ERBB2/HER2 that associate with its carboxyl-terminal sequence through a PDZ (PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1) domain. This peptide sequence acts as a dominant retention or targeting basolateral signal for receptors in epithelial cells. ERBIN belongs to the newly described LAP (LRR and PDZ) protein family, whose function is crucial in non vertebrates for epithelial homeostasis. Whereas ERBIN appears to locate ERBB2/HER2 to the basolateral epithelium, PICK1 is thought to be involved in the clustering of receptors. We show here that ERBIN and PICK1 bind to ERBB2/HER2 with different mechanisms, and we propose that these interactions are regulated in cells. Since ERBIN and PICK1 tend to oligomerize, further complexity of protein networks may participate in ERBB2/HER2 functions and specificity.

The ERBB2 protein belongs to the large family of receptors with tyrosine kinase activity (RTK)1 and more precisely to the ERBB subfamily of four receptors which includes the EGF receptor. Upon dimerization and activation, it phosphorylates many substrates including itself. This step induces a network of protein interactions. For example, phosphotyrosine binding and SH2 domains found in cytosolic proteins such as GRB2 and SHC adaptors bind to phosphorylated ERBB2 and lead to the activation of the RAS pathway (1Ullrich A.

PDZ domains are 90–100-amino acid domains that interact with short peptides usually found at the carboxyl terminus of proteins. Proteins bearing a S/TXV motif, such as the glutamate receptors (NMDAR) and K+ channels, interact with class I PDZ domains found in LIN-7 and PSD-95 (9Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J.

A third class of PDZ domain including the NOS PDZ domain binds to DXV peptides and PDZ domains (11Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H.

Within the RTK superfamily, several members have a canonical PDZ domain binding site in carboxyl-terminal position, i.e. two ERBB receptors (ERBB2/HER2 and ERBB4/HER4), MUSK (a muscle-specific receptor), and several EPH receptor family members involved in developmental processes such as axon guidance. Kim and colleagues have demonstrated the importance of PDZ domain proteins for RTKs function in nonvertebrates. LET-23, the homolog of ERBB receptors in C. elegans, is localized to the basolateral epithelial membrane upon interaction with LIN-7, a PDZ protein that associates with LIN-2 and LIN-10, two other PDZ domain proteins (3Simske J.S. Kaech S.M. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Cell. 1996; 85: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 13Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K.

The LIN-7/LIN-2/LIN-10 complex is crucial for proper LET-23 function in insuring a basolateral localization of LET-23 molecules in epithelial cells. Subsequent work has inferred that a subset of mammalian EPH receptors are recruited to specific subcellular compartments in neurons presumably by contacting AF6 and PICK1, two PDZ proteins (4Hock B.

These adaptors are also targets for the tyrosine kinase activity of EPHR and may participate in their signaling. Among ERBB family members, ERBB4/HER4 is a binding partner for PSD-95, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase also associated with K+ channels and NMDAR in neurons (7Garcia R.A. Vasudevan K.

It is thought that these PDZ interactions both restrict proteins to specific subcellular compartments and actively participate to signaling events.

ERBB2/HER2 contains a bona fide PDZ domain binding site in its carboxyl terminus and we previously characterized ERBIN (ERBB2-interacting protein), a novel PDZ domain protein, as a partner for the receptor in epithelia (6Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adélaı̈de J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 7: 407-414Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To identify additional ERBB2/HER2 binding partners, we screened a mouse muscle library by the two-hybrid procedure and identified a second partner for ERBB2/HER2 named PICK1. PICK1 is a single PDZ domain protein originally described as an interactor for PKCα (18Staudinger J. Zhou J. Burgess R. Elledge S.J. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). PICK1 is thought to act as a scaffold protein able to cluster receptors and components of signaling or targeting machineries at specific sites in cells (19Xia J. Zhang X. Staudinger J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). We show by using the two-hybrid system, GST pull-down, and coimmunoprecipitation analysis in living cells that PICK1 specifically interacts with ERBB2/HER2. PICK1 binds to the VXV motif found in ERBB2/HER2 but, in contrast to ERBIN, the PDZ domain alone is not sufficient for the interaction. PICK1 also interacts with the VXV motif found in MUSK and ERBB4/HER4 receptors, two RTKs important for the function of neuromuscular junctions, whereas ERBIN prefers a S/T/VXV motif present in ERBB2/HER2 and proteins unrelated to RTK. Furthermore, we show that ERBIN has a propensity to oligomerize through a PDZ-PDZ domain interaction. Activation of ERBB2 interferes with ERBIN, but not with PICK1, ability to interact with the receptor. We finally show that the carboxyl-terminal sequence of ERBB2/HER2 is a dominant basolateral localization sequence per se since it is able to redirect an apical receptor to the basolateral surface of MDCK cells. This study suggests that diverse PDZ domain proteins are involved in the regulation of ERBB2/HER2 functions. To prepare the baits used in this paper, the 15 last amino acids of ERBB2 wild type or mutant or the 15 last amino acids of various proteins were fused to the LexA-BD subunit using pBTM116 vector, which carries Trp1. For library screening, an oligo(dT) primed mouse cDNA muscle library cloned in pACT2 vector, which carries LEU2 as a selection marker, was screened by using the LexA-ERBB2 as a bait and the yeast strain L40 following the lithium-acetate protocol. Approximately 106 TRP + LEU + transformants were selected on plates with supplemented minimum medium that lacked tryptophan, leucine, and histidine in the primary screening and contained 10 mm 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) and then tested for the β-galactosidase activity by the filter method in the secondary screening. After rescue, the DNA of selected clones was retransformed in L40 yeast containing LexA-ERBB2 or LexA fused to control peptides. Specific clones were positive for growth in histidine-deficient medium and β-galactosidase activity and encoded for PICK1. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg·ml−1 aprotinin and 10 μg·ml−1 leupeptin. Sodium orthovanadate at 200 μm final was added to lysis buffer when cells were stimulated by EGF. After centrifugation at 16,000 × gfor 20 min, supernatants were saved for further procedures. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose was added and immune complexes bound to beads were recovered after 1 h, washed three times with HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), boiled in 1× sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Transfer and immunoblotting on nitrocellulose using horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit or horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse antibody/chemiluminescence method were performed as described (20Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). For overlay assays, the membrane was incubated 2 h at room temperature with soluble GST fusion proteins labeled with protein kinase A and [γ-32P]ATP diluted in TBS, 5% dried milk, 1 mm dithiothreitol (106cpm/ml). After rinsing with TBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 and TBS buffers, bound GST was revealed by autoradiography. GST production and GST binding assays were performed as described previously (20Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). COS-1 and MDCK II cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units·ml−1 penicillin and 100 μg·ml−1 streptomycin sulfate, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All cell transfections were made using Fugene 6 reagent according to manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Human ERBIN cDNA was used to create different constructs allowing expression of the protein in procaryote or eucaryote cells (GST, Myc, LexA-BD-tagged proteins). The RK5-myc vector was used to express proteins fused to the Myc epitope (20Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The pGEX-Tag vector was used to produce all GST fusion proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis were performed using the Quick-Change kit (Stratagene). All constructs were sequenced by Genome Express, SA (Grenoble, France). A rat cDNA library was used as a template to amplify a fragment encoding the DENSIN-180 PDZ domain (residues 1342–1492) and AF6 PDZ domain (residues 1007–1124). Chimeras between the human P75NTR and human ERBB2/HER2 or GBT-1 were done by PCR using reverse primers coding for the last 15 amino acids of either ERBB2/HER2 or GBT-1 in order to replace the last 15 residues of P75NTR. All constructs were sequenced and subcloned into pIRES (CLONTECH). The resulting plasmids were transfected into MDCK II cells, and stable populations were obtained after G418 selection. Anti-Myc 9E10 (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) monoclonal antibody was used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. 4G10 (anti-PY) monoclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and Dako, respectively. A rabbit anti-ERBIN polyclonal antibody was produced by injecting a soluble GST-ERBIN-(914–1371) fusion protein. Anti-PICK1 goat antibody was from Santa Cruz Inc. Transfected MDCK cells were grown on coverslips for 3 days after confluence and then treated as described (21Le Bivic A. Real F.X. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9313-9317Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) using ME 20-4, a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of human P75NTR and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Gp114, an apical glycoprotein of MDCK II cells (22Le Bivic A. Sambuy Y. Mostov K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Transfected MDCK II cells were grown on Transwell™ filters for 5 days after seeding and processed for selective cell surface biotinylation as described before (23Monlauzeur L. Rajasekaran A. Chao M.

P75NTR or chimeras were immunoprecipitated using the ME 20-4 antibody followed by streptavidin precipitation. Quantitative analysis was done using the Bio-Image IQ software. We have recently isolated ERBIN, a partner for ERBB2/HER2 in epithelia. ERBIN is a novel PDZ domain protein belonging to the LAP (LRR and PDZ) protein family that includes DENSIN-180, SCRIBBLE, and LET-413 (6Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V.

The ERBIN PDZ domain interacts with the 15 carboxyl-terminal residues in ERBB2, which contain a VXV motif. We used the two-hybrid system in yeast to further delineate critical residues important for this interaction. Position for each residue is given starting position (0) for the carboxyl-terminal valine, followed by (−1) for the proline, (−2) for the valine, and so on (Fig.1 A). Each amino acid in the ERBB2 peptide was changed to alanine except for alanine in −12 position changed to glycine. Peptides fused to the LexA binding domain (LexA-BD) were challenged against the GAL4 activation domain (GAL4-AD) fused to the ERBIN PDZ domain (Fig. 1 A). Interaction was evidenced by the capacity of cotransformed L40 yeast to grow on plates depleted of histidine (−HIS) supplemented with 10 mm 3-AT and to present a positive β-galactosidase activity. As previously shown, mutation of the carboxyl-terminal valine (mutant VA) and deletion of the 6 last residues (data not shown) in ERBB2 abrogated the interaction with ERBIN (6Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adélaı̈de J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 7: 407-414Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Interaction was also altered when Val in −2 position, Asp in −3 position, Leu in −4 position, and Tyr in −7 position were mutated (Fig. 1 A). We expressed ERBB2 (wild type and mutants) in COS cells and precipitated receptors with a GST-ERBIN PDZ domain in a pull-down assay (Fig.1 B). Replacement of the COOH-terminal valine, aspartic acid in −3 position, leucine in −4 position, and tyrosine in −7 position to alanine as well as truncation of ERBB2 (Δ6 mutant) reduced the binding to the ERBIN PDZ domain. No change was found when asparagine in −10 position was mutated to alanine. Mutation of valine (−2) did not modify the interaction in the pull-down assay contrasting with the two-hybrid data. This may imply that this residue is not as crucial for ERBIN-ERBB2 interaction in vivo. To obtain further information on the ERBIN PDZ domain binding specificity, we used a Far Western strategy to test the interaction of this domain with peptides found in the carboxyl terminus of receptors and ion channels (Fig.1 C). These sequences, except for EGFR and ERBB3, are known ligands for PDZ domains. Nine-amino acid peptides were fused to the GST protein, and equivalent amount of proteins were resolved by Western blot. The membrane was incubated with a soluble and radiolabeled32P-GST-ERBIN PDZ. After washing, the membrane was exposed for autoradiography to detect bound radiolabeled proteins. No signal was found when we used a radiolabeled GST alone or GST-AF6 PDZ domain as a probe (data not shown). As expected, the ERBIN PDZ domain interacted with ERBB2 but not with other human EGFR family members while [32P]GST-LIN-7 efficiently bound to the worm LET-23 (data not shown). Among the other fusion proteins tested, the carboxyl termini of Kv1.4, NR2C and NR2B interacted strongly with ERBIN (Fig.1 C). Interestingly, these peptides have sequence similarities to the ERBB2 peptide at the crucial positions found for ERBIN interaction, namely a carboxyl-terminal valine, an acidic residue in −3 position (Asp or Glu), and hydrophobic residues in −4 and −7 positions (tyrosine, isoleucine, or leucine). Position −2 can support a serine, threonine, or valine. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the ERBIN PDZ domain binds to a ΨXXΨ[ED][STV]XV peptide, where Ψ represents hydrophobic residue and X any amino acid. We searched in data bases for other mammalian proteins containing such a motif and found the proteins listed in Fig. 1 D, including a transmembrane phosphatase (RPTPζ), PMCA4, a calcium pump, and MKP5, a dual specificity phosphatase specific for p38 and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. These are potential binding partners for ERBIN. Interestingly, brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1), a potential ERBIN interactor with seven-span transmembrane domains, has indeed been shown to bind PDZ domain proteins (28Shiratsuchi T. Futamura M. Oda K. Nishimori H. Nakamura Y. Tokino T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies of PSD-95, DLG, and CASK/LIN-2 show that PDZ domains comprise two α helixes and six β sheets (29Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 30Morais Cabral J.H. Petosa C. Sutcliffe M.J. Raza S. Byron O. Poy F. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H.

Biol. 1998; 5: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal peptide of receptors binds to the groove between the second α helix and the second β sheet with a GLGF motif providing a carboxylate-binding loop. A residue found in the second α helix (His for class I; Val, Leu, or Gln for class II; and Tyr for NOS class III PDZ domain) selects a certain type of ligand depending on the residue found in −2 position in the peptide. Hence, the PSD-95 class I PDZ domain prefers a Ser or Thr in −2 position in the peptide ligand and the CASK/LIN-2 class II PDZ domain selects hydrophobic residues in −2 position while class III PDZ domain in NOS binds to an aspartic residue (Asp) in −2 position. In a previous report, we identified a mutation within the ERBIN PDZ domain (mutant YD) changing the His residue in αB helix to Tyr as found in NOS, which abrogates the interaction with ERBB2 (6Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adélaı̈de J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 7: 407-414Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The NOS PDZ domain interacts with DXV motifs. We mutated the Val-2 residue to Asp-2 in ERBB2 but no interaction was found with the ERBIN YD mutant by using the two-hybrid system (Fig.2 A). Thus, mutation YD abrogates interaction with ERBB2 but does not shift the ERBIN PDZ domain specificity from class I to class III. This result can be explained by the fact that the functional NOS PDZ domain requires additional amino acids beyond the conserved PDZ domain consensus domain (12Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett Jr, D.E. Bredt D.S. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This additional region is not present in the ERBIN PDZ domain. We also mutated the histidine to leucine as found in class II PDZ domain (mutant HL). Surprisingly, interaction with ERBB2 was improved as L40 yeast co-expressing LexA-ERBB2/GAL4-ERBIN HL grew on −HIS plates containing 50 mm 3-AT in contrast to LexA-ERBB2/GAL4-ERBIN PDZ domain wild type. Growth was identical on 10 mm 3-AT plates. This result was confirmed in a GST pull down assay where ERBB2 was more efficiently precipitated by ERBIN HL mutant than by ERBIN wild type (Fig. 2 C). The VXV motif in ERBB2 binds to the class I ERBIN PDZ domain, although it conforms to the ΨXΨ motif binding site for class II PDZ domains. Changing His to Leu in ERBIN PDZ domain αB helix improves the binding to VXV-containing peptides. Accordingly, the ERBIN PDZ domain mutant HL now binds to the VXV motif found in EPHB2 (data not shown). We have thus identified important residues within ERBB2 and ERBIN peptide sequences responsible for the interaction between the PDZ domain and its ligand. Promiscuous interaction with various receptors is a frequent theme for PDZ domains. For example, the CASK/LIN-2 PDZ domain binds to neurexins and syndecans (32Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J.

On the other hand, receptors can bind different PDZ proteins, e.g. a class of EPH receptors binds to syntenin and AF6 PDZ domains (4Hock B. Bohme B. Karn T. Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Holtrich U.

We have shown that the ERBIN PDZ domain interacts in vitro with several peptide ligands (Fig. 1 C). Conversely, it is likely that ERBB2 binds to other PDZ domain-containing proteins. To search for other ERBB2 partners, we screened a murine muscle cDNA library with LexA-ERBB2 as a bait. Four different clones were pulled out, each encoding the full-length PICK1 protein (Fig.3 A). PICK1 is an ubiquitous 50-kDa protein containing an amino-terminal PDZ domain and a coiled-coil region in its carboxyl terminus. PICK1 was originally described as a partner for PKCα, AMPA, EPH receptors, and, more recently, water channel aquaporins through a PDZ domain interaction (5Torres R. Firestein B.L. Dong H.

Neuron. 2000; 26: 417-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We found no binding between PICK1 (or ERBIN) and ERBB2 when the carboxyl-terminal valine in ERBB2 was replaced by an alanine (LexA-ERBB2.VA) (Fig. 3 A). To further delineate the region of PICK1 involved in the interaction, we introduced a 100-amino acid carboxyl-terminal deletion in the protein and failed to detect an interaction between deleted PICK1-(1–305) and ERBB2. Additionally, a previously described mutation within the PICK1 PDZ domain changing K27D28 to AA also disrupted the interaction PICK1-ERBB2 (Fig. 3 A) (39Staudinger J. Lu J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). As in the case of NOS PDZ domain, these results suggest that the PICK1 PDZ domain is necessary but not sufficient to bind to ERBB2 (12Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett Jr, D.E. Bredt D.S. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To confirm our two-hybrid data, we produced GST fusion proteins encompassing PICK1 (GST-PICK1), deleted PICK1 (GST-PICK1 1–305), mutated PICK1 (GST-PICK1mut), and the PICK1 PDZ domain (GST-PICK1 PDZ).

In this report, we analyzed the enzymatic activity of hCGn6ST by expressing it in cultured cells.

When hCGn6ST was expressed together with human keratan sulfate Gal-6-sulfotransferase (hKSG6ST), HeLa cells produced highly sulfated carbohydrate detected by an anti-keratan sulfate antibody 5D4. These results indicate that hCGn6ST transfers sulfate to C-6 of GlcNAc in keratan sulfate. Amino acid substitutions in hCGn6ST identical to changes resulting from missense mutations found in MCD patients abolished enzymatic activity. Moreover, mouse intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase had the same activity as hCGn6ST.

The importance of keratan sulfate sulfation in the cornea has been also suggested that lack of sulfation on keratan sulfate is a major cause of the hereditary eye disorder, macular corneal dystrophy (MCD)1 (1Hassell J.R.

MCD patients show spotted opacity in the cornea, especially in the extracellular matrix of the stroma. The size of the opaque area increases progressively, and the patients require keratoplasty. By genetic linkage analysis, the critical region for MCD has been mapped to chromosome 16q22 (11Vance J.M. Jonasson F. Lennon F. Sarrica J. Damji K.F. Stauffer J. Pericak-Vance M.A. Klintworth G.K.

Previous reports indicated that the cornea of MCD patients synthesizes normal levels of poly-N-acetyllactosamine but does not contain keratan sulfate, suggesting that the sulfation step of keratan sulfate is impaired in MCD (9Nakazawa K.

One of the carbohydrate sulfotransferases, keratan sulfate Gal-6 sulfotransferase, has shown that the enzyme transfers sulfate to the Gal residue of poly-N-acetyllactosamine and keratan sulfate, but the gene encoding this sulfotransferase does not map to the MCD candidate region (14Fukuta M.

These sulfotransferases are highly homologous to each other, especially in the binding domains to the sulfate donor, PAPS (20Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct.

We previously identified a carbohydrate sulfotransferase that maps to the critical MCD region by EST data base searches, and we designated it corneal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (22Akama T.O. Nishida K. Nakayama J. Watanabe H. Ozaki K. Nakamura T. Dota A. Kawasaki S. Inoue Y. Maeda N. Yamamoto S. Fujiwara T. Thonar E.J. Shimomura Y. Kinoshita S. Tanigami A. Fukuda M.N. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This protein, which is homologous to other carbohydrate sulfotransferases, is expressed in corneal cells. Several types of mutations, including deletion and missense mutations, were found in this gene in genomic DNAs derived from MCD patients, leading to identification of the causative gene of MCD. Here, we analyze the enzymatic activity of human corneal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (hCGn6ST) using transfected HeLa cells, and we show that the enzyme transfers sulfate onto the C-6 of GlcNAc in a synthetic substrate and poly-N-acetyllactosamine. We also confirm that missense mutations in hCGn6ST found in MCD patients result in a failure of synthesizing highly sulfated keratan sulfate in the transfected cells. Moreover, our results indicate that mouse intestine GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (mIGn6ST), which has been identified to be a homologue of human intestine GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (hIGn6ST) (18Lee J.K. Bhakta S. Rosen S.D. Hemmerich S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), has the same activity as hCGn6ST, suggesting that mIGn6ST is the mouse orthologue of hCGn6ST and functions to produce keratan sulfate in the mouse cornea. A nucleotide fragment of the hCGn6ST ORF was obtained from previously reported hCGn6ST cDNA (22Akama T.O. Nishida K. Nakayama J. Watanabe H. Ozaki K. Nakamura T. Dota A. Kawasaki S. Inoue Y. Maeda N.

ORFs of hKSG6ST and hIGn6ST were also amplified from human genomic DNA by PCR using the following primers: for hKSG6ST, 5′-TTGGAGAAGCAGCCCCATGAAG-3′ and 5′-CACCGCCCGGGTCACGAG-3′; and for hIGn6ST, 5′-TGGGAAGTCCAATGGGTAGGGT-3′ and 5′-CCCCAGCTCCCTCTCCACCA-3′. Obtained amplicons were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) by the TA cloning method, resulting in pcDNA3-hCGn6ST, pcDNA3-hKSG6ST, and pcDNA3-hIGn6ST. An EST containing mIGn6ST cDNA was purchased from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO). Based on the EST sequence, full-length cDNA was amplified by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique using mouse brain Marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The obtained amplicon, which encodes a peptide sequence identical to mIGn6ST (18Lee J.K. Bhakta S. Rosen S.D. Hemmerich S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), was inserted into pcDNA3, resulting in pcDNA3-mIGn6ST. An expression vector encoding soluble hCGn6ST was prepared as follows. A DNA fragment coding catalytic domain of hCGn6ST was amplified from pcDNA-hCGn6ST vector by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GGTAGATCTGCCAGGGCCCTCGTCCCCA-3′ and 5′-GATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′ (SP6 primer, Invitrogen). After digestion with BglII and XbaI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), this amplicon was inserted into the BamHI-XbaI sites of pcDNAHSH, which encodes the signal sequence of human colony-stimulating factor and multicloning site of EpiTagTMpcDNA3.1/His B (Invitrogen) in pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector. The resultant expression vector, pcDNAHSH-hCGn6ST, encodes a cleavable signal sequence (23Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

An expression vector encoding R50C mutant hCGn6ST was prepared as follows. A DNA fragment of hCGn6ST, which contains R50C mutation, was amplified from an MCD patient (22Akama T.O. Nishida K.

After digestion with ApaI and SfiI (New England Biolabs), this amplicon was inserted to the pcDNA3-hCGn6ST that was digested with ApaI and SfiI. Five expression vectors, each of which encoded a hCGn6ST mutant, K174R, D203E, R211W, A217T, and E274K, were prepared with the same method described above except PCR primers (5′-GACGTGTTTGATGCCTATCTGCCTTG-3′ and 5′-CGGCGCGCACCAGGTCCA-3′) and the restriction enzymes for replacement (SfiI and XhoI). An expression vector for intact hCGn6ST was transfected into HeLa cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After incubation for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% of fetal bovine serum (DMEM, 10% FBS), the cells were washed with PBS, scraped, and collected into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. The cells were again washed with PBS and suspended into cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the sample was centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as an enzyme fraction. Soluble hCGn6ST was prepared as follows. The expression vector pcDNAHSH-hCGn6ST was transfected into HeLa cells as described above. Following 24 h of incubation in DMEM, 10% FBS, the medium was replaced with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After incubation for 24 h, the medium was collected and concentrated by Microcon YM-30 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and used as an enzyme fraction. Protein concentration of each enzyme fraction was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The condition for sulfotransferase reaction was as described previously (24Hasegawa N. Torii T. Kato T. Miyajima H. Furuhata A. Nakayasu K. Kanai A. Habuchi O. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

One μg of protein from enzyme fraction was incubated with 15 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm imidazole HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm MnCl2, 2 mm 5′-AMP, 20 mm NaF, 50 nCi of [35S]PAPS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.5 mm substrate (GlcNAc%1–6Manα1–6Man%-octyl) (25Ujita M.

After adding 1 ml of water to stop the reaction, the product was purified by High Load C18 column (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) (26Ong E. Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25608-25612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A portion of the purified product was subjected to scintillation counting, and the remainder was lyophilized and used for further analysis. Expression vectors encoding intact hCGn6ST and/or hKSG6ST were transfected into HeLa cells as described above. Following 24 h of incubation in DMEM, 10% FBS, the medium was replaced with S-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and [35S]sodium sulfate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a concentration of 100 μCi/ml. After a 24-h incubation, cells were washed with PBS, scraped, and collected into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. The cells were washed again with PBS and extracted with 500 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1). The cell pellets were washed with 200 μl of methanol and digested in 200 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmCaCl2 with 20 μl of 1 mg/ml Pronase (Calbiochem). After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, 20 μl of freshly prepared Pronase (1 mg/ml) were added and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The digested mixture was boiled for 5 min to stop the reaction. After phenol and chloroform extraction, the sample in the aqueous phase was subjected to Sephadex G-50 column chromatography (1 × 45 cm, equilibrated with 0.1 m NH4HCO3). The carbohydrate fraction that eluted in the void volume was collected, desalted by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration (1 × 30 cm, equilibrated with 7% 1-propanol/water), and lyophilized. The sample was dissolved in 150 μl of water and used for further analyses. Purified oligosaccharides (each 5000 cpm) produced by in vitrosulfotransferase reaction were digested with 10 milliunits of %-N-acetylglucosaminidase A from human placenta (Sigma), which cleaves and release both GlcNAc and GlcNAc(6S) from non-reducing terminal of carbohydrate, in 20 μl of 25 mmsodium citrate buffer, pH 3.5 and 100 mm galactose for overnight at 37 °C. The digested samples were boiled for 5 min and were analyzed by HPLC. Metabolically labeled carbohydrate samples (each 5 × 106 cpm) from transfected HeLa cells were digested with 250 milliunits of keratanase from Pseudomonas sp. (Calbiochem) in 90 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the samples were boiled for 5 min to stop the reaction and applied to a column (1 × 45 cm) of Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with 0.1 m NH4HCO3. Each 400 μl of fraction was collected in a tube. Ten μl of each fraction were used to count 35S radioactivity, and the remainder of the fraction was desalted and lyophilized. To remove sialic acid, 0.1 volume of 0.1 n HCl was added to the sample and incubated at 90 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by cooling on ice and addition of 0.1 volume of 2 mNH4HCO3. The sample was desalted and lyophilized. After dissolving in water, the sample was subjected to column chromatography. Exo-%-galactosidase treatment was carried out as follows. The desialylated sample was digested with 0.375 units of jack bean %-galactosidase (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) in 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer, pH 4.0, overnight at 37 °C. After boiling for 5 min, the sample was desalted, lyophilized, and analyzed by column chromatography. A Sephadex G-50 column (1 × 45 cm) was used for gel filtration chromatography. The column was equilibrated and eluted with 0.1 mNH4HCO3. Fractions of 300 μl were collected, and 35S radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. A Whatman Partisil SAX-10 column (4.6 mm × 25 cm) was used for HPLC analysis. This column was equilibrated with 5 mmKH2PO4. The elution conditions were as described previously (14Fukuta M. Inazawa J.

Matsukawa T. Yamakawa T. Kurosawa N. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In brief, the column was eluted with 5 mm KH2PO4 isocratically for the samples produced by %-N-acetylglucosaminidase A treatment. For the samples produced by keratanase treatment, the column was eluted with 5 mm KH2PO4 for 5 min followed by a 20-min gradient from 5 to 250 mmKH2PO4. The flow rate was 1 min/ml. Fractions of 0.5 min were collected, and 35S radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Transfected cells were transferred to a 1.5-ml tube by scraping and washed in PBS. The cells were suspended into 800 μl of TKMS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25m sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by 5 times freeze/thaw cycles. After centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the precipitate was washed with TKMS buffer and suspended in 200 μl of TKMS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. After 10 min of incubation on ice, the sample was centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected as a membrane fraction. Proteins in the membrane fraction were precipitated by cold acetone and dissolved in 1% SDS. Fifty μg of membrane proteins from each transfectant were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. The blotted filter was soaked in 10% skim milk in PBST5.3 (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 5.3) overnight at 4 °C. The filter was washed once with PBST5.3 and incubated with PBST5.3 containing 1% bovine serum albumin and diluted monoclonal antibody 5D4 (Seikagaku Co.) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBST5.3 three times, the filter was incubated with PBST5.3 containing 1% bovine serum albumin and diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat (anti-mouse IgG) antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBST5.3 three times, peroxidase activity was detected by an ECL Plus kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfected cells were fixed in cold methanol at −20 °C for 30 min and treated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol overnight at 4 °C to destroy endogenous peroxidase activities. After washing with PBS5.3 (PBS, pH 5.3), the cells were incubated in 10% goat serum in PBS5.3 for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with diluted 5D4 monoclonal antibody in PBS5.3 containing 10% goat serum for 45 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS5.3 three times, the cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat (anti-mouse IgG) antibody in PBS5.3 for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS5.3 and reacted with aminoethylcarbazole (Zymed Laboratories Inc.Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA) for detection of peroxidase activity. A specific sequence of mIGn6ST mRNA was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-CTCAGCGACCCTGCGCTCAAC-3′ and 5′-CGCACATGGCTGCGGCATAC-3′. The amplified fragment was cloned into the SmaI site of pGEM3Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI) and used to prepare RNA probes with a DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (28Kawakami M. Nakayama J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2321-2324PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical detection of keratan sulfate was performed using the monoclonal antibody 5D4 by the indirect method as described (29Shiozawa T. Tsukahara Y. Nakayama J. Ishii K. Katsuyama T. Gynecol. Obstet. Invest. 1991; 32: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). hCGn6ST has high homology to human and mouse intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferases and belongs to the carbohydrate sulfotransferase family (22Akama T.O. Nishida K. Nakayama J. Watanabe H. Ozaki K. Nakamura T. Dota A. Kawasaki S. Inoue Y. Maeda N. Yamamoto S. Fujiwara T. Thonar E.J. Shimomura Y. Kinoshita S. Tanigami A. Fukuda M.N. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). All sulfotransferases in this family have an activity that transfers sulfate to C-6 of GlcNAc, Gal, or GalNAc. Furthermore, mutations in the gene encoding hCGn6ST cause MCD, a hereditary eye disease in which patients lack sulfated keratan sulfate in the cornea and serum (22Akama T.O. Nishida K. Nakayama J. Watanabe H. Ozaki K. Nakamura T. Dota A. Kawasaki S. Inoue Y. Maeda N. Yamamoto S. Fujiwara T. Thonar E.J. Shimomura Y. Kinoshita S. Tanigami A. Fukuda M.N. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that hCGn6ST is a sulfotransferase that catalyzes sulfation of the C-6 of GlcNAc in keratan sulfate. To examine the enzymatic activity of hCGn6ST, HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors harboring cDNAs encoding intact or soluble hCGn6ST, and enzyme fractions were prepared for analyzing of sulfotransferase activity. In vitro analysis showed that the enzyme fraction from intact hCGn6ST cDNA transfectant has sulfotransferase activity that transfers sulfate from PAPS to a substrate, GlcNAc%1–6Manα1–6Man%-octyl (Fig. 2 A). %-N-Acetylglucosaminidase A treatment revealed that the35S-labeled oligosaccharides produced by in vitro sulfotransferase reaction have sulfate on C-6 of GlcNAc (Fig. 2 B). This enzyme fraction also had sulfotransferase activity for a synthetic substrate, GlcNAc%1–3Gal%1–4GlcNAc%1–3Gal%1–4GlcNAc%1–6Manα1–6Man%-octyl,in vitro (data not shown). Since the enzyme fraction prepared from HeLa cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector alone has no sulfotransferase activity, and the secreted soluble hCGn6ST fraction collected from the culture medium of transfectant cells with pcDNAHSH-hCGn6ST also has the same activity as the intact hCGn6ST fraction (Fig. 2), we concluded that hCGn6ST has sulfotransferase activity that transfers sulfate to C-6 of GlcNAc.Figure 2In vitro analysis of sulfotransferase activity of hCGn6ST. A, cell lysate from pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-hCGn6ST transfected cells, or concentrated culture medium from pcDNAHSH or pcDNAHSH-hCGn6ST transfected cells was used as an enzyme source. These enzymes were incubated with [35S]PAPS and a synthetic carbohydrate substrate, GlcNAc%1–6Manα1–6Man%-octyl, and incorporation of 35S radioactivity to the substrate was counted. B, radiolabeled substrates produced by in vitro sulfotransferase reaction with an enzyme fraction from pcDNA3-hCGn6ST transfectant (circles) or from pcDNAHSH-hCGn6ST transfectant (triangles) were digested with %-N-acetylglucosaminidase A and were subjected to SAX-10 HPLC.

HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors harboring cDNAs encoding hCGn6ST and a sulfotransferase, hKSG6ST, that transfers sulfate onto C-6 of Gal in keratan sulfate (14Fukuta M. Inazawa J. Torii T. Tsuzuki K. Shimada E. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32321-32328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate, and carbohydrates isolated from those cells were analyzed by keratanase treatment. Keratanase recognizes the disaccharide repeat of keratan sulfate that consists of unsulfated Gal connected to sulfated GlcNAc and cleaves the Gal%1–4GlcNAc(6S) linkage (30Nakazawa K. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 912-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A carbohydrate with the same backbone as keratan sulfate but with sulfate on C-6 of Gal or no sulfate on GlcNAc cannot be digested by keratanase. Carbohydrates isolated from HeLa cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector alone or with pcDNA3-hKSG6ST were resistant to keratanase treatment (Fig.3). This finding is consistent with the substrate specificity of keratanase and indicates that HeLa cells express no endogenous sulfotransferases that produce keratan sulfate. On the other hand, keratanase treatment of samples from HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA3-hCGn6ST produced fragments that eluted in fractions 57–72 from a Sephadex G-50 column (Fig. 3). Carbohydrates from the hCGn6ST-expressing cells digested with keratanase were separated into two populations, fractions 63–66 and 68–72, by Sephadex G-50 chromatography. Keratanase-sensitive carbohydrates were also found in cells co-transfected with pcDNA3-hCGn6ST and pcDNA3-hKSG6ST. However, the resultant carbohydrate fragments by keratanase digestion were seen as one broad peak, in contrast to the two peaks observed in hCGn6ST-expressing cells following the same chromatography (Fig. 3). These results suggest that hCGn6ST has activity that transfers sulfate to C-6 of GlcNAc on poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains resulting in production of keratan sulfate. The data also suggest that co-expression of hCGn6ST and hKSG6ST in HeLa cells produces highly sulfated keratan sulfate with sulfate residues not only on GlcNAc but also on C-6 of Gal, making it less sensitive to keratanase. To confirm that hCGn6ST produces keratan sulfate, we analyzed the"

However, the exact biological functions of ANXs still remain obscure. Inhibition of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) by ANX-I, a 346-amino acid protein, has been observed in studies with various forms of PLA(2). Substrate and have been proposed for the mechanism of PLA(2) inhibition by ANX-I. Previously, we proposed a specific interaction model for inhibition of a 100-kDa porcine spleen cytosolic form of PLA(2) (cPLA(2)) by ANX-I (Kim, K. M., Kim, D. K., Park, Y. M., and Na, D. S. (1994) FEBS Lett. 343, 251-255). Herein, we present an analysis of the inhibition mechanism of cPLA(2) by ANX-I in detail using ANX-I and its deletion mutants. Deletion mutants were produced in Escherichia coli, and inhibition of cPLA(2) activity was determined. The deletion mutant ANX-I-(1-274), containing the N terminus to amino acid 274, exhibited no cPLA(2) inhibitory activity, whereas the deletion mutant ANX-I-(275-346), containing amino acid 275 to the C terminus, retained full activity. The protein-protein interaction between cPLA(2) and ANX-I was examined using the deletion mutants by immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid methods. Full-length ANX-I and ANX-I-(275-346) interacted with the calcium-dependent lipid-binding domain of cPLA(2). ANX-I-(1-274) did not interact with cPLA(2). Immunoprecipitation of A549 cell lysate with anti-ANX-I antibody resulted in coprecipitation of cPLA(2). These results are consistent with the specific interaction mechanism rather than the substrate depletion model. ANX-I may function as a negative regulator of cPLA(2) in cellular signal transduction."

Exogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 at concentrations close to its physiological level induces instantaneous Ca2+ influx into RBL-2H3 cells. This PI(3,4,5)P3-induced intracellular Ca2+ increase is independent of phospholipase C activity or the depletion of internal stores. Moreover, inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 or by overexpression of the dominant negative inhibitor Δp85 suppresses the Ca2+ response to the cross-linking of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI). Concomitant treatment of RBL-2H3 cells with LY294002 or Δp85 and 2-aminoethyl diphenylborate, a cell-permeant antagonist of d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, abrogates antigen-induced Ca2+ signals, whereas either treatment alone gives rise to partial inhibition. Conceivably, PI(3,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ entry and capacitative Ca2+ entry represent major Ca2+ influx pathways that sustain elevated [Ca2+]i to achieve optimal physiological responses. This study also refutes the second messenger role ofd-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate in regulating FcεRI-mediated Ca2+ response. Considering the underlying mechanism, our data suggest that PI(3,4,5)P3directly stimulates a Ca2+ transport system in plasma membranes.

Baram D. Mekori Y.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1033-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar). Although the FcεRI-mediated signaling cascade has been characterized, the regulatory mechanism governing mast cell degranulation is only partially understood. FcεRI is a heterotrimeric protein complex (αβγ2) that contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in both the β and γ subunit cytoplasmic domains (2Metzger H. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 125: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) Lyn is associated with the β subunit at the resting state (3Vonakis B.M. Chen H. Haleem-Smith H. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24072-24080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and its action is promoted by FcεRI cross-linking (4Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Lyn phosphorylates ITAMs of the β and γ subunits, resulting in the recruitment of Lyn and Syk, respectively, through Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-mediated interactions with phosphotyrosine residues (5Jouvin M.H. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Valle A. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5918-5925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of these newly recruited PTKs, in turn, facilitates the translocation and phosphorylation of multiple substrates, including phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) isozymes and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (ref review, see Ref. 1Metcalfe D.D. Baram D. Mekori Y.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1033-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar). The activated PLCγ hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) tod-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and diacylglycerol, which induce the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and the activation of protein kinase C, respectively. On the other hand, stimulation of PI3K results in transient accumulation of micromolar levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2). Although the involvement of PI3K in antigen-induced degranulation is established (7Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 65: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), a clear consensus regarding how lipid products derived from the action of PI3K mediate the cellular responses has yet to emerge. Putative downstream targets for PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 include SH2- or pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing signaling enzymes such as PLC-γ, Akt, and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) (12Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 13Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), which transduce the signal to the respective signaling pathways. In addition, data from several laboratories suggest a role of PI3K in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) increase in mast cells (9Hirasawa N. Sato Y. Yomogida S. Mue S. Ohuchi K. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Barker S.A. Lujan D. Wilson B.S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 65: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Miura K. MacGlashan D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 2199-2205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that PI3K may mediate [Ca2+]i elevation in mast cells via two distinct mechanisms. First, in vitro data indicate that PI(3,4,5)P3 stimulates Ins(1,4,5)P3 production by activating PLCγ isozymes (15Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.S. Kim S.R. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 9: 483-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This PLCγ activation may be attained directly by facilitating membrane translocation (15Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.S. Kim S.R. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 16Barker S.A. Caldwell K.K. Pfeiffer J.R. Wilson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 483-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or indirectly via Btk (14Miura K. MacGlashan D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 2199-2205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kawakami Y. Kitaura J. Satterthwaite A.B. Kato R.M. Asai K. Hartman S.E. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Lowell C.A. Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Kawakami T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1210-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Second, PI3K may increase [Ca2+]i by facilitating Ca2+mobilization across plasma membranes (11Barker S.A. Lujan D. Wilson B.S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 65: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This premise was prompted by data showing the inhibitory effect of PI3K inhibitors on antigen-induced Ca2+ response (9Hirasawa N. Sato Y. Yomogida S. Mue S. Ohuchi K. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Barker S.A. Lujan D. Wilson B.S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 65: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Miura K. MacGlashan D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 2199-2205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is in line with the notion that two distinct Ca2+ influx pathways (capacitative versus non-capacitative) are operative in antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells (18Lee R.J. Oliver J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 825-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the proposed involvement of PI3K in the regulation of a non-capacitative Ca2+ influx pathway is reminiscent of our finding of a PI(3,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ entry mechanism in platelets (19Lu P.J. Hsu A.L. Wang D.S. Chen C.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9776-9783Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and Jurkat T cells (20Hsu A.L. Ching T.T. Sen G. Wang D.S. Bondada S. Authi K.S. Chen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16242-16250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Consequently, we hypothesize that this PI(3,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ entry is a conserved mechanism that plays a crucial role in the regulation of receptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling among these hematopoietic cells. This hypothesis is corroborated by the present data showing the involvement of this PI(3,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+influx in FcεRI-mediated Ca2+ response in RBL-2H3 mast cells. Considering the crucial role of Ca2+ influx in the secretion of inflammatory mediators, this mechanism provides a molecular basis whereby PI3K regulates mast cell function. Moreover, given that PI3K and PLCγ are the downstream effectors of the FcεRI-mediated tyrosine kinase cascade, we propose that these two enzymes act in a concerted manner to initiate Ca2+ response to antigen stimulation. In stimulated cells, PI3K and PLCγ act on the mutual substrate PI(4,5)P2 to generate PI(3,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,4,5)P3, respectively, which activate Ca2+ channels at different cellular compartments to provide the elevated [Ca2+]irequired for optimal physiological responses. d-myo-Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, potassium salt (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) 1-O-(1,2-di-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-O-phosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, protonated form (PI(3,4,5)P3), 1-O-(1,2-di-O-octanoyl-sn-glycero-3-O-phosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, protonated form (di-C8-PI(3,4,5)P3), 1-O-(1,2-di-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-O-phosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol 3,4-bisphosphate, protonated form (PI(3,4)P2), 1-O-(1,2-di-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3-O-phosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate, protonated form (PI(4,5)P2), and 1-O-(1,2-di-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-O-phosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol 3-monophosphate, protonated form (PI(3)P) were synthesized as previously reported (21Lu P.J.

Chem. 1996; 61: 5905-5910Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The identity and purity of all inositol phosphates and inositol lipids were verified by 1H and31P NMR and high resolution mass spectrometry. Published data from this and other laboratories have shown that PI(3,4,5)P3 and other inositol lipids are cell-permeant and can readily fuse with cell membranes to exert cellular responses in different types of cells, including platelets (19Lu P.J.

Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2 AM), fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (fluo-3 AM), and 2-aminoethyoxy diphenylborate (2-APB) were purchased from Calbiochem. Leupeptin, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), and the antigen dinitrophenol-conjugated human serum albumin (DNP-HSA) were products from Sigma. [3H]Inositol was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. DNP-specific monoclonal IgE was a kind gift from Dr. Henry Metzger (Chemical Immunology Section, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health). The construct expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Δp85 (HA·Δp85) was provided by Professor Alex Toker (Harvard Medical School). Monoclonal anti-HA and rabbit anti-Btk antibodies were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and BD Biosciences, respectively. RBL-2H3 cells (from ATCC) were maintained in monolayer culture in 75-cm3 plastic tissue culture flasks containing 15 ml of Eagle's minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% gentamicin at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. [Ca2+]i was monitored by change in the fluorescence intensity of fura-2-loaded cells. RBL-2H3 cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) were suspended in 1 ml of assay buffer consisting of 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, 24.3 mmNaH2PO4, 4.3 mmK2HPO4, 113 mm NaCl, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4. fura-2 loading was achieved by exposing the cells to 10 μm fura-2 AM in the presence of 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm probenacid in the dark for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, washed with assay buffer twice, and resuspended at 8 × 105 cells/ml in the same buffer containing 1 mm Ca2+. The effect of various inositol lipids on [Ca2+]i was examined by fura-2 fluorescence in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorimeter at 37 °C with excitation and emission wavelengths at 340 and 510 nm, respectively, as described in the literature (25da Silva C.P. Emmrich F. Guse A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12521-12526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wolfe P.C. Chang E.Y. Rivera J. Fewtrell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6658-6665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The maximum fura-2 fluorescence intensity (Fmax) in RBL-2H3 cells was determined by adding 4-bromo-A23187 (1 μm), and the minimum fluorescence (Fmin) was determined following depletion of external Ca2+ by 5 mmEGTA. The [Ca2+]i was calculated according to the equation [Ca2+]i =Kd(F −Fmin)/(Fmax −F), where Kd denotes the apparent dissociation constant (Kd = 224 nm) of the fluorescence dye-Ca2+ complex (27Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized with 1 μg/ml mouse DNP-specific IgE overnight. Cells were collected, suspended in assay buffer, loaded with fura-2, and activated by the antigen DNP-HSA (1 μg/ml). Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored by fura-2 fluorimetry as described above. All the above fura-2 experiments were also repeated with fluo-3-loaded cells in a similar manner. fluo-3 displays a lowerKd (864 nm at 37 °C) and a longer excitation wavelength (505 nm) of the dye-Ca2+ complexvis à vis fura-2 (28Merritt J.E. McCarthy S.A. Davies M.P. Moores K.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Consistent results were obtained with both fluorescence dyes. Δp85 is a deletion mutant that lacks a region required for tight association with p110 but is still able to bind to appropriate phosphotyrosine targets. Thus, Δp85 can compete with native p85 for binding to essential signaling proteins and behaves as a dominant negative mutant. Transient transfection of HA·Δp85 was carried out using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. In brief, Opti-MEM medium (1.5 ml) containing the indicated amount of the HA·Δp85 expression vector (3–12 μg) was incubated with 120 μl of the Plus reagent at 25 °C for 15 min, and 12 μl of the LipofectAMINE reagent in 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM was added. In parallel, an empty pCMV/blue plasmid (12 μg) was subjected to the same treatment as a negative control. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and added to 9 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). RBL-2H3 cells in a T-75 flask were washed with serum-free Opti-MEM and were added to the aforementioned transfection medium. After 3 h at 37 °C, the transfection media were replaced with 15 ml of Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The transfected cells were allowed to grow for 2 days to express foreign DNA. The collected cells were analyzed for antigen-induced Ca2+ response by fluorescence spectrometry and for HA·Δp85 expression by Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody. The release of mast cell mediators by exocytosis was monitored by the β-hexosaminidase assay. RBL-2H3 cells were grown in 12-well plates and passively sensitized with DNP-specific IgE. The IgE-sensitized cells were washed twice with Tyrode's buffer consisting of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.4 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Secretion was initiated by exposing cells to the antigen DNP-HSA (1 μg/ml). After 1 h, the reaction was terminated by placing the plate on ice. The enzyme activities of β-hexosaminidase in 50 μl of supernatants and attached cells solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 were measured with 200 μl of 1 mm p-nitrophenylN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide in 0.1m sodium citrate, pH 4.5, at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of 0.1 mNaHCO3. The release of the product p-nitrophenol was measured by monitoring the absorbance at 400 nm. The percentage of degranulation was calculated by dividing the absorbance of the supernatant over the combined absorbance of the supernatant and cell lysate. The examination of phosphoinositol turnover was carried out according to a modification of the procedure described previously (20Hsu A.L. Ching T.T. Sen G. Wang D.S. Bondada S. Authi K.S. Chen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16242-16250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In brief, RBL-2H3 cells were incubated withmyo-[2-3H]inositol (10 μCi/106cells/ml) in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then washed with the medium, sensitized with DNP-specific IgE, and washed with 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, containing 285 mm NaCl, 11 mmKCl, 1.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, 8.3 mmNaHCO3, 1.6 mm MgSO4, 2.2 mm MgCl2, 2.2 mm CaCl2, and 5.6 mm glucose. Aliquots containing 1 × 106 cells were each resuspended in 0.3 ml of the aforementioned assay buffer and transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Each sample was incubated with 0.3 μg of DNP-HSA for the indicated times and quenched by adding 0.25 ml of 6% trichloroacetic acid. The tubes were centrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 ×g. The supernatant (200 μl) was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography on a 5-μm Adsorbosphere Sax column (4.6 × 200 mm) equilibrated with H2O. The [3H]inositol phosphates were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.9 mNH4H2PO4 in 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected every 1 ml, and their radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Synthetic [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3, [3H]Ins(4,5)P2, and Ins(4)P were used as standards. The respective retention times were 60, 48, 43, and 31 min. For the Ca2+ release assay, the plasma membrane was purified as previously described (20Hsu A.L. Ching T.T. Sen G. Wang D.S. Bondada S. Authi K.S. Chen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16242-16250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In brief, RBL-2H3 cells (4 × 108 cells) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 5 ml of PM buffer consisting of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 110 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm AEBSF, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. The cell suspension was homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer using a loose pestle with five strokes up and down. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was suspended in 3.125 ml of PM buffer and mixed with 5.5 ml of 69% (w/w) sucrose to make a final 44% (w/w) sucrose-membrane mixture. The mixture was overlaid with 42.3% (w/w) sucrose, and the two-phase suspension was subjected to centrifugation at 90,000 ×g for 2 h in a swinging bucket rotor. The membrane material at the interface of the phases contained the greatest enrichment in plasma membranes based on the activity of (Na+-K+)-ATPase. This fraction was collected, suspended in 5 ml of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm AEBSF, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. To investigate the involvement of PI3K in antigen-stimulated Ca2+ response in mast cells, we first examined the effect of exogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 on [Ca2+]i in RBL-2H3 cells. Exposure of fura-2-loaded RBL-2H3 cells to PI(3,4,5)P3, ranging from 1 to 20 μm, elicited an instantaneous [Ca2+]i increase in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A, upper panel). This PI(3,4,5)P3 effect became saturated at 20 μm, beyond which no significant enhancement in the amplitude of Ca2+ response was noted (data not shown). The PI(3,4,5)P3-induced [Ca2+]i rise was largely attributable to Ca2+ influx, because the increase could be abolished by Ca2+ depletion with 5 mmEGTA (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). With regard to other phosphoinositides examined, PI(3,4)P2 at high doses (20 μm) could also elicit [Ca2+]iincrease but to a much lesser extent than PI(3,4,5)P3 (Fig.1 B, upper panel), however. The potency was ∼10% of that of PI(3,4,5)P3. On the other hand, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3)P did not show any appreciable effect on [Ca2+]i (lower panel). These data suggest the presence of a PI(3,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ influx mechanism in RBL-2H3 mast cells. Data from several groups suggest that PI(3,4,5)P3 might stimulate Ins(1,4,5)P3production by activating PLCγ isozymes via discrete mechanisms (9Hirasawa N. Sato Y. Yomogida S. Mue S. Ohuchi K. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,11Barker S.A. Lujan D. Wilson B.S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 65: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Miura K. MacGlashan D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 2199-2205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This raised a concern that PI(3,4,5)P3-induced [Ca2+]i increase might, in part, be due to Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum stores. To refute this possibility, we first examined the effect of two distinct pharmacological inhibitors that blocked Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ mobilization. These included the PLC inhibitor U73122 (10 μm) and the cell-permeant antagonist of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors 2-APB (40 μm) (29Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem.

Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Although these inhibitors were effective in attenuating FcεRI-mediated Ca2+ response in RBL-2H3 cells (Figs. 3 and 4), they did not display significant effect on PI(3,4,5)P3-induced [Ca2+]iresponse. The extents of the [Ca2+]i increase elicited by 20 μm PI(3,4,5)P3 in RBL-2H3 cells pretreated with U73122 and 2-APB were 95 ± 2% (n = 3) and 98 ± 2% (n = 3), respectively, of that of the untreated control.Figure 4Overexpression of Δp85 inhibits FcεRI-mediated Ca2+ response and secretion in RBL-2H3 cells. A, expression levels of HA·Δp85 in RBL-2H3 cells that had been transfected with 1 μg/ml of a control pCMV/blue plasmid (a) or with increasing amounts of the HA·Δp85-expressing plasmid (b, 0.25 μg/ml; c, 0.5 μg/ml;d, 0.75 μg/ml; e, 1 μg/ml) for 2 days. The Western analysis was carried out using antibodies against the HA tag. The loading amounts of individual samples were calibrated in reference to actin as internal standard (data not shown). Data are representative of three independent experiments. B, Δp85 inhibited FcεRI-mediated Ca2+ response in a dose-dependent manner. C, Δp85 inhibited FcεRI-mediated secretion of β-hexosaminidase in a dose-dependent manner. Cells expressing different levels of Δp85 (a–e, as indicated above) were collected after overnight sensitization with DNP-specific IgE. The collected cells were loaded with fura-2 and stimulated with DNP-HSA (Ag) to test for Ca2+ response and β-hexosaminidase secretion(a–e in accordance with the above designations). In addition, cells expressing the highest level of Δp85 were treated with 2-APB (40 μm) for 10 min before antigen stimulation. As shown, the concerted action of Δp85 and 2-APB abrogated the Ca2+ signal (trace f in B) and β-hexosaminidase secretion (vertical bar f inC). Traces are representative of three independent experiments. Vertical bars shown are means ± S.D. (n = 3). Consistent results were obtained when another fluorescence dye fluo-3 was used in the above experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Furthermore, we obtained evidence that thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ pools were not disturbed by PI(3,4,5)P3. RBL-2H3 cells were exposed to 20 μmPI(3,4,5)P3 in a Ca2+-depleted medium, followed by 1 μm thapsigargin. As shown in Fig.2, PI(3,4,5)P3 did not affect the extent of thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ response visà vis that without PI(3,4,5)P3 pretreatment. Together, these results bore out the premise that PI(3,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ response was independent of PLC activity and was solely attributable to Ca2+ influx from the medium. The existence of a PI(3,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ entry mechanism suggests a link between PI3K and receptor-activated Ca2+signaling in RBL-2H3 cells. Because both PI3K and PLCγ are downstream effectors in FcεRI-mediated tyrosine kinase cascades, we hypothesized that PI3K acted in concert with PLCγ in initiating the Ca2+ response to FcεRI cross-linking. To test this hypothesis, a combination of pharmacological and molecular genetic approaches was employed to characterize the role of PI3K in FcεRI-induced Ca2+ response. First, the effect of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on antigen-stimulated Ca2+ response in fura-2-loaded RBL-2H3 cells was assessed. In this study, LY294002 was used in lieu of wortmannin to inhibit PI3K in cells in light of the nonspecific effect of wortmannin on myosin light-chain kinase, one of the key regulatory enzymes in mast cells (8Yano H. Agatsuma T. Nakanishi S. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized with DNP-specific IgE overnight, loaded with the fluorescence indicator, and pretreated with varying concentrations of LY294002. After stimulation with the antigen DNP-HSA (1 μg/ml), changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored by fluorimetry. In line with the earlier reports that the antigen-stimulated Ca2+ response was largely attributable to Ca2+ influx (11Barker S.A. Lujan D. Wilson B.S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 65: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31Kim T.D. Eddlestone G.T. Mahmoud S.F. Kuchtey J. Fewtrell C. J. Biol.

Fig. 3 indicates that LY294002 pretreatment attenuated the amplitude of antigen-induced Ca2+ response in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of LY294002 on the Ca2+ response attained maximum at 200 μm, beyond which no further decrease was noticed (data not shown). Presumably, the residual Ca2+ response following LY294002 treatment was attributed to Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ release and the consequent c"

These results suggest that modulation of PIPs in both the GEF catalytic activity and the targeting to plasma membrane determines the outcome of the biologic activity of Dbl. guanine nucleotide exchange factor Dbl homology pleckstrin homology phosphatidylinositol phosphates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate 5P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 4,5P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate GTPases-activating proteins polyvinylidene difluoride 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride phosphate-buffered saline Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fluorescein isothiocyanate glutathioneS-transferase wild type dithiothreitol bovine serum albumin phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate The Rho family GTPases are tightly regulated molecular switches that modulate several important cellular functions. They have a central role in the regulation of actin-based cytoskeletal organization and mediate signal transduction pathways leading to transcriptional control and cell growth regulation (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5184) Google Scholar). The Rho GTPases are regulated by three different classes of proteins as follows: the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 that activate Rho GTPases by stimulating the GTP-GDP exchange reaction; the GTPases-activating proteins (GAPs) that stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of G proteins; and the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) that antagonize GEFs and GAPs activities (2Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar).GEFs for Rho family of GTPases are composed of a large family of proteins all characterized by a region of sequence similarity consisting of the Dbl homology (DH) domain in tandem with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Whereas the DH domain is the minimal region required to bind Rho GTPases, both domains are necessary for the biologic activity of these proteins in vivo (2Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 3Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).The pleckstrin homology domains are protein motifs of about 100 amino acids that have been identified in more than 100 molecules involved in signal transduction, including serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, phospholipases, cytoskeletal proteins, and regulators of small GTPases (4Mayer B.J.

Cell. 1998; 95: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the sequence homologies among PH domains are very low, it was found that their tertiary structures are very similar.All the PH domains have a core β-sandwich formed by two antiparallel β-sheets of three and four strands, respectively, and capped at one corner by a C-terminal α- helix. The three loops between the β-strands are very different in length and sequence and form a positively charged surface that has been shown to represent the ligand-binding site to phosphoinositides (8Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). These observations lead to the hypothesis that PH domains are implicated in the transient localization of proteins to the plasma membrane. Further studies on the specificity of binding between PH domain and PIPs have demonstrated that different PH domains bind distinct PIPs probably to allow regulation by specific extracellular signals (18Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A.K. Carraway K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Wang D.S. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Indeed PI3,4,5P3 was shown to bind to Vav PH domain and to enhance Vav GEF activity on Rac1 GTPase. On the other hand binding of PI4,5P2 to Vav PH domain causes inhibition of GEF activity, suggesting that the PH domain of Vav regulates GEF activity through binding to PI3K substrate and products (20Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 21Ma A.D. Metjian A. Bagrodia S.

Similarly, it appears that intramolecular interactions between DH and PH domains regulate Sos GEF activity and that these interactions are mediated by PIPs binding to Sos PH domain (22Das B. Shu X.

Nature. 1985; 316: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) is the putative exchange factor for the small GTPases RhoA and Cdc42 (25Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that both the DH and the PH domains are required for the cellular functions of Dbl. The minimal structural unit of oncogenic Dbl conferring transforming activity just encompasses the DH and the PH domains. Moreover, we have reported that the Dbl PH domain targets the Dbl DH domain to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of the cell (26Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol.

Here we report that Dbl PH domain interacts in vitro with PI4,5P2 and PI3,4,5P3 and that these interactions modulate Dbl GEF activity both in vitro andin vivo. Moreover, we show evidence that Dbl PH domain localizes to the plasma membrane and that this localization is dependent on its interactions with PIPs. This dual modulation of PH domain functions by PIPs appears to result in the efficient outcome of the biologic activity of Dbl.DISCUSSIONIt has been demonstrated that the interaction of PH domains with specific lipids can regulate the activity of associated catalytic domains. PH-containing proteins, like dynamin, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, protein kinase B, and ARNO activities are regulated by PIPs (36Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querful E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R.

Moreover, GEF activity of exchange factors for the Rho family GTPases can be modulated by PIPs via binding to their PH domains (18Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A.K. Carraway K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G.

Our results show that purified Dbl PH domain associates with PIPs in a lipid dot-blot assay and provide evidence that interaction of PIPs with PH domain modulates both the GEF catalytic activity and the intracellular localization of Dbl. The lipid dot-blot assay does not allow a quantitative comparison of phosphoinositide binding specificity but rather it is a valuable way to assess qualitative specificity of ligand recognition by PH domains (19Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Although 32P-labeled GST alone gave no signals above background, we found that the Dbl PH domain showed clear selectivity and bound strongly to PI4,5P2 and PI3,4,5P3. We have occasionally observed a very weak binding of Dbl PH domain to PI3,5P2 (see Figs. 1 and 3). However, we did not consider this signal indicative of a real interaction between Dbl PH domain and PI3,5P2. The strong difference in Dbl PH binding specificity to PI3,5P2 versusPI4,5P2 and PI3,4,5P3 and the non-reproducibility of these data suggest a nonspecific type of interaction, possibly due to the presence in the PIP preparations of contaminants like PI4,5P2.We have previously demonstrated that in the Dbl oncogene the PH domain mediates the protein localization to the Triton X-100-insoluble component of the cell, suggesting a protein-protein interaction (26Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). On the other hand, binding of PH domains with PIPs is thought to determine the translocation of proteins to the plasma membrane where they may be activated by membrane components or have improved access to substrates. Indeed several proteins containing a PH domain translocate to plasma membrane upon receptor stimulation. Likewise, the PH domain of the GEF Lfc mediates the protein membrane localization (41Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and the interaction of the GEF Tiam1 N-terminal PH domain with PI3,4,5P3 and PI4,5P2 seems to be responsible for the regulated translocation of Tiam1 to the membrane (33Kubiseski T.J. Chook Y.M. Parris W.E. Rozakis-Adcock M. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1799-1804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 42Michiels F. Stam J.C.

Our results show that the Dbl PH domain both localizes to plasma membrane and actin stress fibers. Whereas the actin stress fiber location confirms our previous cell fractionation results, the association with the plasma membrane raises new possibilities in Dbl PH regulatory functions. Positively charged amino acids located in a loop between β1- and β2-sheets have direct interaction with PIPs (8Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). We show here that three positively charged amino acids in Dbl PH domain, Lys712, Lys714, and Arg724, mediate the interaction with phosphatidylinositols since their substitution with neutral amino acids blocks this interaction. The Dbl PH mutants, unable to bind PIPs, fail to localize to plasma membrane but fully retain their ability to co-localize with the actin cytoskeleton. Finally, our studies indicate that the Dbl GEF activity in vitro is not augmented by interaction with PIPs but rather is inhibited by both PI3K substrate and product and that the exchange activity of Dbl bearing mutations in these amino acids is no longer affected by PI4,5P2 and PI3,4,5P3. Therefore, the PH interaction with PIPs may have dual effects on the DH domain as well as on Dbl protein, localizing it to the plasma membrane and meanwhile negatively regulating its enzymatic activity.Several PH domains were shown to bind to F-actin (43Yao L. Janmey P. Frigeri L.G. Han W. Fujita J. Kawakami Y. Apgar J. Kawakami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19752-19761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In particular basic residues toward the ends of a short sequence around the β1 region of the Btk PH domain were shown to be sufficient for binding to actin. Because this was proven to be correct for several other PH domains containing basic residues as well, actin binding does not seem to be dependent exclusively on the presence of basic residues. In fact, the Vav PH domain, which contains a cluster of basic residues, binds weakly to actin. Dbl PH domain localization to both plasma membrane and actin stress fibers may be mediated by different residues in its PH domain. This could explain why mutations in the positively charged amino acids located in positions corresponding to those affecting binding to PIPs interfere only with plasma membrane localization. Two positively charged residues, Arg718 and Lys720, are present in the β1 region of the Dbl PH domain. These residues do not align with those known in other PH domains to interact with PIPs. Nevertheless, mutagenesis analysis will clarify if these basic residues, present in the β1 region of the PH domain, mediate the association of Dbl protein to cytoskeleton actin.Analysis of the crystal structure of the DH/PH domains of Sos (17Soisson S.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30340-30344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) suggest a direct association between these two domains. More recent studies (20Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) have shown that Vav GEF activity is regulated by binding of the PH domain to substrates and products of PI3-kinase that promote or disrupt the intramolecular interaction between the DH and the PH domains (21Ma A.D. Metjian A. Bagrodia S. Taylor S. Abrams C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Dbl GEF activity in vitro is not influenced by the PH domain, whereas its integrity is indispensable for Dbl activityin vivo (25Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Ron D. Zannini M. Lewis M. Wickner R.B. Hunt L.T. Graziani G. Tronick S.R. Aaronson S.A. Eva A. New Biol. 1991; 3: 372-379PubMed Google Scholar). Binding studies indicate that the Dbl PH domain does not interact in vitro with the DH domain in the absence of PIPs. 2Y. Gao and Y. Zheng, unpublished information. We show here that interaction of PH domain with PIPs interferes with complex formation between Dbl DH domain and its substrate Cdc42. These results suggest that DH domain function is subjected to the PH domain modulation under the influence of PIPs, possibly by induction of a direct intramolecular interaction between these two domains.The transforming activity of Dbl mutant proteins does not appear to correlate with their ability to stimulate activation of GTPases in the cells. In fact, whereas GTP-bound Cdc42 and RhoA increase from about 2-fold up to 6-fold in NIH3T3 cells transformed with DH/PH-s and DH/PH-t, respectively, the focus forming activity of the DH/PH-s protein does not increase proportionally and that of the DH/PH-t mutant even decreases by almost 3-fold in comparison with wild type Dbl protein. Thus, Dbl mutant proteins are fully active in terms of their GEF activity, but their ability to stimulate GTPases remains somehow ineffective. There appears to be a lack of direct correlation between inhibition of GEF activity by PIPs, as we noticed in the in vitro exchange assays, and the reduction of transforming activity that we observed in vivo with Dbl PH mutants. One possible explanation is that the site of activation, not occurring at the plasma membrane, does not correlate with an efficient interaction of Cdc42 and/or RhoA with their substrates. Alternatively, GTPases may be activated in a region of the cell where they cannot interact with GAPs. GTP-bound GTPases will thus accumulate because of an improper cycling of GTP binding and hydrolysis. In fact, both published (47Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and our unpublished observations 3Y. Zheng, and A. Eva, unpublished information.indicate that constitutively activated, GTPase-defective Cdc42 expressed in NIH3T3 cells is not transforming but rather has a detrimental effect on cell growth.To improve the sensitivity of our transformation assay, we have used a truncated form of Dbl protein (residues 497–875) rather than the full-length clone. Our previous studies have demonstrated that removal of the N terminus induces activation of Dbl protein and that the removal of the C-terminal 50 residues does not affect Dbl oncogene-transforming efficiency. Nevertheless, it is possible that the full-length proto-oncogene product reacts differently to binding to PIPs. Future studies will determine the biochemical and biological responses of proto-Dbl protein to PIP interaction.In conclusion, we show here that inhibition of binding of Dbl PH domain to PIPs causes an increase in activation of Cdc42 and RhoA in NIH3T3 cells, prevents Dbl protein association with plasma membrane, and induces a decreased cellular transforming activity. These data suggest that PIPs may regulate DH catalytic activity toward its substrates through PH binding to plasma membrane and support a model whereby a fine balance between modulation of GEF activity and regulated targeting to plasma membrane of Dbl protein by PIPs may determine the efficient outcome of the Dbl biologic activity. The Rho family GTPases are tightly regulated molecular switches that modulate several important cellular functions. They have a central role in the regulation of actin-based cytoskeletal organization and mediate signal transduction pathways leading to transcriptional control and cell growth regulation (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5184) Google Scholar). The Rho GTPases are regulated by three different classes of proteins as follows: the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 that activate Rho GTPases by stimulating the GTP-GDP exchange reaction; the GTPases-activating proteins (GAPs) that stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of G proteins; and the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) that antagonize GEFs and GAPs activities (2Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). GEFs for Rho family of GTPases are composed of a large family of proteins all characterized by a region of sequence similarity consisting of the Dbl homology (DH) domain in tandem with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Whereas the DH domain is the minimal region required to bind Rho GTPases, both domains are necessary for the biologic activity of these proteins in vivo (2Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 3Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The pleckstrin homology domains are protein motifs of about 100 amino acids that have been identified in more than 100 molecules involved in signal transduction, including serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, phospholipases, cytoskeletal proteins, and regulators of small GTPases (4Mayer B.J.

Expression of the TREX genes in human cells was investigated using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction strategy. Our results show that TREX1 and TREX2 are expressed in all tissues tested, providing direct evidence for the expression of these genes in human cells. Potential transcription start sites are identified for the TREX genes using rapid amplification of cDNA ends to recover the 5′-flanking regions of the TREX transcripts. The 5′-flanking sequences indicate transcription initiation from consensus putative promoters identified −140 and −650 base pairs upstream of the TREX1 open reading frame (ORF) and −623 and −753 base pairs upstream of the TREX2 ORF. Novel TREX1 and TREX2 cDNAs are identified that contain protein-coding sequences generated from exons positioned in genomic DNA up to 18 kilobases 5′ to the TREX1 ORF and up to 25 kilobases 5′ to the TREX2 ORF. These novel cDNAs and sequences in the GenBank™ data base indicate that transcripts containing the TREX1 and TREX2 ORFs are produced using a variety of mechanisms that include alternate promoter usage, alternative splicing, and varied sites for 3′ cleavage and polyadenylation. These initial studies have revealed previously unrecognized complexities in the structure and expression of the TREX1 and TREX2 genes."
https://openalex.org/W1911267965,"Six β4-galactosyltransferase (β4GalT) genes have been cloned from mammalian sources. We show that all six genes are expressed in the Gat−2 line of Chinese hamster ovary cells (Gat−2 CHO). Two independent mutants termed Pro−5Lec20 and Gat−2Lec20, previously selected for lectin resistance, were found to have a galactosylation defect. Radiolabeled biantennary N-glycans synthesized by Pro−5Lec20 were proportionately less ricin-bound than similar species from parental CHO cells, and Lec20 cell extracts had a markedly reduced ability to transfer Gal to GlcNAc-terminating acceptors. Northern blot analysis revealed a severe reduction in β4GalT-1 transcripts in Pro−5Lec20 cells. The Gat−2Lec20 mutant expressed β4GalT-1 transcripts of reduced size due to a 311-base pair deletion in the β4GalT-1 gene coding region. Northern analysis with probes from the remaining five β4GalT genes revealed that Gat−2 CHO and Gat−2Lec20 cells express all six β4GalT genes. Unexpectedly, the β4GalT-6 gene is not expressed in either Pro−5 or Pro−5Lec20 cells. Thus, in addition to a deficiency in β4GalT-1, Pro−5Lec20 cells lack β4GalT-6. Nevertheless, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry data of N-glycans released from cellular glycoproteins showed that both the β4GalT-1− (Gat−2Lec20) and β4GalT-1−/β4GalT-6−(Pro−5Lec20) mutants have a similar Gal deficiency, affecting neutral and sialylated bi-, tri-, and tetraantennaryN-glycans. By contrast, glycolipid synthesis was normal in both mutants. Therefore, β4GalT-1 is a key enzyme in the galactosylation of N-glycans, but is not involved in glycolipid synthesis in CHO cells. β4GalT-6 contributes only slightly to the galactosylation of N-glycans and is also not involved in CHO cell glycolipid synthesis.

Interestingly, the ability of β4GalT-4 to transfer Gal to GlcNAc is activated by α-lactalbumin (11Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 29331-29340Google Scholar), and the activity of both β4GalT-1 and β4GalT-2 with GlcNAc is inhibited by α-lactalbumin (9Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H.

It was reported that β4GalT-4 is most efficient in galactosylating mucin-type, core 2 branch oligosaccharides (12Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 34843-34849Google Scholar), whereas β4GalT-1 is most efficient in galactosylating i/I antigens (13Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Suzuki M. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 9296-9304Google Scholar). It was also suggested that β4GalT-5 may function best in transferring Gal toO-glycans (14van Die I. van Tetering A. Schiphorst W.E. Sato T. Furukawa K. van den Eijnden D.H. FEBS Lett... 1999; 450: 52-56Google Scholar).For glycolipid acceptors, all β4GalTs show a different activity. Thus, β4GalT-1 has high activity for GlcCer, Lc3, and nLc5 in in vitro assays (9Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 31979-31991Google Scholar). β4GalT-3, -4, and -5 have little activity with GlcCer (9Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H.

Wakisaka E. Yoshizuka N. Imokawa G. Dohmae N. Takio K. Hattori M. Matsuo N. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 13570-13577Google Scholar). β4GalT-3 utilizes Lc3 efficiently, but not nLc5 (11Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 29331-29340Google Scholar); and nLc5 is a poor substrate for β4GalT-4 and β4GalT-5 (10Sato T. Furukawa K.

Chem... 1998; 273: 29331-29340Google Scholar).To identify in vivo functions of each β4GalT, it is important to consider the tissue expression pattern as well as acceptor specificity. For example, β4GalT-1 is up-regulated in lactating mammary glands (16Harduin-Lepers A. Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 14348-14359Google Scholar), whereas β4GalT-2 is not. 2J. H. Shaper, personal communication. 2J. H. Shaper, personal communication. Furthermore, mice deficient in β4GalT-1 do not produce lactose in milk (17Asano M. Furukawa K. Kido M. Matsumoto S. Umesaki Y. Kochibe N. Iwakura Y. EMBO J... 1997; 16: 1850-1857Google Scholar, 18Lu Q. Hasty P. Shur B.D. Dev. Biol... 1997; 181: 257-267Google Scholar). The β4GalT-1, -3, -4, and -5 genes are ubiquitously expressed, whereas the β4GalT-2 and β4GalT-6 genes exhibit a more restricted expression pattern (8Lo N.W. Shaper J.H. Pevsner J. Shaper N.L. Glycobiology.. 1998; 8: 517-526Google Scholar, 10Sato T. Furukawa K. Bakker H. van den Eijnden D.H. van Die I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 472-477Google Scholar, 11Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 29331-29340Google Scholar). Although ∼80% mice lacking β4GalT-1 die soon after birth, the remainder are viable and fertile (17Asano M. Furukawa K. Kido M. Matsumoto S. Umesaki Y. Kochibe N. Iwakura Y. EMBO J... 1997; 16: 1850-1857Google Scholar, 18Lu Q. Hasty P. Shur B.D. Dev. Biol... 1997; 181: 257-267Google Scholar). Serum glycoproteins from β4GalT-1−/− mice were found to be galactosylated to ∼10% compared with those from wild-type mice (19Kido M. Asano M. Iwakura Y. Ichinose M. Miki K. Furukawa K. FEBS Lett... 1999; 464: 75-79Google Scholar), providing evidence for the existence of other functional β4GalTs. However, almost nothing is known of the biological roles of these β4GalTs, and their acceptor specificity has not been defined forin vivo substrates.To identify glycosyltransferases and other factors that regulate glycosylation in mammals, we have isolated a number of lectin-resistant CHO glycosylation mutants (20Stanley P. Raju T.S. Bhaumik M. Glycobiology.. 1996; 6: 695-699Google Scholar). Two independent CHO mutants that were selected for resistance to PHA-E belong to the Lec20 complementation group and behave as loss-of-function mutants in somatic cell hybrids (21Stanley P. Sallustio S. Krag S.S. Dunn B. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet... 1990; 16: 211-223Google Scholar). In this study, we show that they are both defective in the β4-galactosylation of N-glycans due to independent mutations in the β4GalT-1 gene. We also report that Pro−5 CHO cells lack β4GalT-6 transcripts; and therefore, Pro−5Lec20 mutants derived from Pro−5 CHO cells lack both β4GalT-1 and β4GalT-6 activities. Analyses of N-glycans and glycolipids synthesized by these four CHO cell lines identified in vivosubstrates for several β4GalTs.DISCUSSIONThe knowledge that mammals have six β4GalTs with overlappingin vitro acceptor specificities (8Lo N.W. Shaper J.H. Pevsner J. Shaper N.L. Glycobiology.. 1998; 8: 517-526Google Scholar, 36Amado M. Almeida R. Schwientek T. Clausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1473: 35-53Google Scholar, 37Furukawa K. Sato T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1473: 54-66Google Scholar) presents the challenge of sorting out their unique biological functions. An important question is the degree of redundancy between different members of the β4GalT family in transferring Gal to complex glycoprotein and glycolipid acceptors. To begin to address this question, we have identified N-glycan and glycolipid structures synthesized in CHO cells that express the six β4GalTs compared with mutant cells that lack β4GalT-1, β4GalT-6, or both. We have shown that mutants of the Lec20 complementation group (21Stanley P. Sallustio S. Krag S.S. Dunn B. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet... 1990; 16: 211-223Google Scholar) lack β4GalT-1 activity. In Gat−2Lec20 CHO cells, it is due to a deletion mutation that removes exons III and IV of the β4GalT-1 gene so that only the N-terminal 214 amino acids of β4GalT-1 can be synthesized. Pro−5Lec20 CHO cells have a mutation that results in extremely low steady-state levels of β4GalT-1 transcripts. The overall phenotype of both Lec20 mutants is essentially identical (21Stanley P. Sallustio S. Krag S.S. Dunn B. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet... 1990; 16: 211-223Google Scholar); and thus, it was of interest to discover that Pro−5Lec20 cells have no detectable β4GalT-6 transcripts. The β4GalT-6 deficiency in Pro−5Lec20 cells originated from the parental Pro−5 CHO cells, which are also completely devoid of β4GalT-6 gene transcripts. Therefore, we used the four cell lines to investigate the relative contributions of β4GalT-1, β4GalT-6, and the four remaining β4GalTs to in vivo Gal transfer to glycoproteins and glycolipids and to in vitro galactosyltransferase acceptor specificity for various acceptors.A summary of mutants and their properties is given in TableV. The loss of β4GalT-1 had the most profound effect on in vitro lactose synthase activity and on the transfer of Gal to the biantennary GnGn glycopeptide (Table IV). One or more of the remaining five β4GalTs transferred Gal quite efficiently to GlcNAc, tri- and tetraantennary glycopeptides, and the core 2 oligosaccharide, although β4GalT-1 provided ≥50% of the activity with these acceptors. Interestingly, β4GalT-1 did not contribute to the transfer of Gal to GlcCer in CHO cell extracts, even though recombinant β4GalT-1 uses GlcCer as an acceptor (9Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 31979-31991Google Scholar). Thin-layer chromatography of glycolipids from both the Lec20 mutant lines confirmed that β4GalT-1 does not contribute to the synthesis of LacCer or GM3 in CHO cells (Fig. 8).Table VSummary of CHO β4GalT mutantsGat−2 CHOGat−2Lec20Pro−5 CHOPro−5Lec20β4GalT transcriptsβ4GaT-1+Deletion+Few5-aAlthough Northern analysis did not detect β4GalT-1 transcripts, RT-PCR gave the expected product.β4GaT-2++++β4GaT-3++++β4GaT-4++++β4GaT-5++++β4GaT-6++AbsentAbsentNeutralN-glycans (MALDI-TOF-MS)Undergalactosylated(+)+++++++++SialylatedN-glycans (MALDI-TOF-MS)Undergalactosylated(+)+++++Glycolipid synthesis (HPTLC5-bHigh-performance TLC.)GM3 and LacCer++++++++++++++++5-a Although Northern analysis did not detect β4GalT-1 transcripts, RT-PCR gave the expected product.5-b High-performance TLC. Open table in a new tab The in vitro results with microsomal membranes suggest that β4GalT-1 is the most important β4GalT in galactosylating biantennary N-glycans (Table IV). This conclusion is supported by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of neutral and sialylatedN-glycans (Tables II and III). Gat−2 CHO cells, which express all six β4GalTs, synthesize fully galactosylated tetra- or triantennary neutral N-glycans, but have appreciable amounts of undergalactosylated biantennary N-glycans. In Lec20 mutants that lack functional β4GalT-1, almost every possible partially galactosylated N-glycan is synthesized, but the predominant species is undergalactosylated biantennaryN-glycans. Thus, β4GalT-1 is required for efficiently generating fully galactosylated bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary neutralN-glycans. Most interestingly, only a very small proportion of the partially galactosylated structures that predominate in Lec20 mutants acquire sialic acid (Table III). In fact, no biantennaryN-glycans containing 1 Gal residue capped with sialic acid were detected. This strongly suggests that the first sialic acid is not transferred by the α2,3 sialyltransferase in CHO cells until both Gal residues are present on a biantennary structure. In addition, it is apparent that only one partially galactosylated triantennary structure (SG2Gn3M3Gn2) and one tetraantennary structure (SG1Gn4M3Gn2) were present in Lec20 mutants. None of the other neutralN-glycans with 1, 2, or 3 Gal residues (see Table II) were sialylated (see Table III). Also of interest are the severalN-glycans that appear to have polylactosamine sequences among the sialylated species.The results of in vitro galactosyltransferase assays and glycan analyses reveal subtle but significant effects of the absence of β4GalT-6 in CHO cells. The Pro−5 CHO cell extract, which lacks β4GalT-6, had significantly, although slightly, reduced activity with all acceptors except GlcCer (Table IV). By far the biggest effect of the loss of β4GalT-6 in Pro−5 CHO was in the ∼44% reduced transfer of Gal to the triantennary acceptor from fetuin (GnGnβ4Gn). This was not reflected in an abundance of undergalactosylated triantennary N-glycans in Pro−5 CHO glycoproteins, however. In fact, there were only minor peaks of bi- and triantennary neutral N-glycans lacking Gal residues in Pro−5 CHO glycoproteins. By contrast, for the sialylated N-glycans, the absence of β4GalT-6 gave rise to the same species of undergalactosylated tri- and tetraantennary structures as did the absence of β4GalT-1. Thus, Pro−5 CHO cells lacking only β4GalT-6 contained only a subset of the fully galactosylated, sialylated N-glycans synthesized by the full complement of six β4GalTs in Gat−2 CHO cells. Finally, it can be seen from the spectrum of complex N-glycans synthesized in the double mutant Pro−5Lec20 that the effects of missing β4GalT-1 and β4GalT-6 are essentially additive.Perhaps the most unexpected result with cells lacking β4GalT-6 was the fact that this was not reflected in an increased amount of GlcCer due to reduced synthesis of LacCer and GM3 (Fig. 8). β4GalT-6 was called LacCer synthase when first cloned (15Nomura T. Takizawa M. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Wakisaka E. Yoshizuka N. Imokawa G. Dohmae N. Takio K. Hattori M. Matsuo N. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 13570-13577Google Scholar) and has been proposed to be a major β4GalT responsible for LacCer synthesis. Although it is true that all the β4GalTs can synthesize LacCer in vitro, β4GalT-6 and β4GalT-5 are more closely related to each other than to the other β4GalTs at the amino acid level. Thus, it may be that β4GalT-5 is the β4GalT that synthesizes LacCer in CHO cells because it is clear that neither β4GalT-1 nor β4GalT-6 is responsible. In summary, the Gal transfer properties of Gat−2 CHO cells, which express all six β4GalTs, compared with those of glycosylation mutants lacking functional β4GalT-1 (Gat−2Lec20), β4GalT-6 (Pro−5 CHO), or both (Pro−5Lec20) show that β4GalT-1 is a key enzyme for the galactosylation of complex N-glycans and that neither β4GalT-1 nor β4GalT-6 is involved in glycolipid synthesis in CHO cells (Table V). β4-Galactosyltransferase (β4GalT)1 is a Golgi-localized, type II transmembrane glycoprotein that catalyzes the transfer of galactose to GlcNAc, forming Galβ1,4GlcNAc (lactosamine) units in glycoconjugates (1Shaper N.L.

Also, terminal galactose residues function as ligands for galactose-binding proteins such as galectins (5Perillo N.L. Pace K.E. Seilhamer J.J. Baum L.G.

Further cloning and data base analyses identified five additional human genes that have 30–55% amino acid identity to the original β4GalT-1 (8Lo N.W. Shaper J.H. Pevsner J. Shaper N.L. Glycobiology.. 1998; 8: 517-526Google Scholar). Each encodes a galactosyltransferase that utilizes the donor substrate UDP-Gal and transfers Gal in a β1,4-linkage to GlcNAc or Glc (8Lo N.W.

Interestingly, the ability of β4GalT-4 to transfer Gal to GlcNAc is activated by α-lactalbumin (11Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 29331-29340Google Scholar), and the activity of both β4GalT-1 and β4GalT-2 with GlcNAc is inhibited by α-lactalbumin (9Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 31979-31991Google Scholar). It was reported that β4GalT-4 is most efficient in galactosylating mucin-type, core 2 branch oligosaccharides (12Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 34843-34849Google Scholar), whereas β4GalT-1 is most efficient in galactosylating i/I antigens (13Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Suzuki M. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 9296-9304Google Scholar). It was also suggested that β4GalT-5 may function best in transferring Gal toO-glycans (14van Die I. van Tetering A. Schiphorst W.E. Sato T. Furukawa K. van den Eijnden D.H. FEBS Lett... 1999; 450: 52-56Google Scholar). For glycolipid acceptors, all β4GalTs show a different activity. Thus, β4GalT-1 has high activity for GlcCer, Lc3, and nLc5 in in vitro assays (9Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 31979-31991Google Scholar). β4GalT-3, -4, and -5 have little activity with GlcCer (9Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H.

FEBS Lett... 1999; 450: 52-56Google Scholar). β4GalT-6 is a lactosylceramide synthase predicted to be important for glycolipid biosynthesis (15Nomura T. Takizawa M. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Wakisaka E. Yoshizuka N. Imokawa G. Dohmae N. Takio K. Hattori M. Matsuo N. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 13570-13577Google Scholar). β4GalT-3 utilizes Lc3 efficiently, but not nLc5 (11Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 29331-29340Google Scholar); and nLc5 is a poor substrate for β4GalT-4 and β4GalT-5 (10Sato T. Furukawa K. Bakker H. van den Eijnden D.H. van Die I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 472-477Google Scholar, 11Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 29331-29340Google Scholar). To identify in vivo functions of each β4GalT, it is important to consider the tissue expression pattern as well as acceptor specificity. For example, β4GalT-1 is up-regulated in lactating mammary glands (16Harduin-Lepers A. Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 14348-14359Google Scholar), whereas β4GalT-2 is not. 2J. H. Shaper, personal communication. 2J. H. Shaper, personal communication. Furthermore, mice deficient in β4GalT-1 do not produce lactose in milk (17Asano M. Furukawa K. Kido M. Matsumoto S. Umesaki Y. Kochibe N. Iwakura Y. EMBO J... 1997; 16: 1850-1857Google Scholar, 18Lu Q. Hasty P. Shur B.D. Dev. Biol... 1997; 181: 257-267Google Scholar). The β4GalT-1, -3, -4, and -5 genes are ubiquitously expressed, whereas the β4GalT-2 and β4GalT-6 genes exhibit a more restricted expression pattern (8Lo N.W. Shaper J.H. Pevsner J. Shaper N.L. Glycobiology.. 1998; 8: 517-526Google Scholar, 10Sato T. Furukawa K. Bakker H. van den Eijnden D.H. van Die I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 472-477Google Scholar, 11Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 29331-29340Google Scholar). Although ∼80% mice lacking β4GalT-1 die soon after birth, the remainder are viable and fertile (17Asano M. Furukawa K. Kido M. Matsumoto S. Umesaki Y. Kochibe N. Iwakura Y. EMBO J... 1997; 16: 1850-1857Google Scholar, 18Lu Q. Hasty P. Shur B.D. Dev. Biol... 1997; 181: 257-267Google Scholar). Serum glycoproteins from β4GalT-1−/− mice were found to be galactosylated to ∼10% compared with those from wild-type mice (19Kido M. Asano M. Iwakura Y. Ichinose M. Miki K. Furukawa K. FEBS Lett... 1999; 464: 75-79Google Scholar), providing evidence for the existence of other functional β4GalTs. However, almost nothing is known of the biological roles of these β4GalTs, and their acceptor specificity has not been defined forin vivo substrates. To identify glycosyltransferases and other factors that regulate glycosylation in mammals, we have isolated a number of lectin-resistant CHO glycosylation mutants (20Stanley P. Raju T.S. Bhaumik M. Glycobiology.. 1996; 6: 695-699Google Scholar). Two independent CHO mutants that were selected for resistance to PHA-E belong to the Lec20 complementation group and behave as loss-of-function mutants in somatic cell hybrids (21Stanley P. Sallustio S. Krag S.S. Dunn B. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet... 1990; 16: 211-223Google Scholar). In this study, we show that they are both defective in the β4-galactosylation of N-glycans due to independent mutations in the β4GalT-1 gene. We also report that Pro−5 CHO cells lack β4GalT-6 transcripts; and therefore, Pro−5Lec20 mutants derived from Pro−5 CHO cells lack both β4GalT-1 and β4GalT-6 activities. Analyses of N-glycans and glycolipids synthesized by these four CHO cell lines identified in vivosubstrates for several β4GalTs. DISCUSSIONThe knowledge that mammals have six β4GalTs with overlappingin vitro acceptor specificities (8Lo N.W. Shaper J.H. Pevsner J. Shaper N.L. Glycobiology.. 1998; 8: 517-526Google Scholar, 36Amado M. Almeida R. Schwientek T. Clausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1473: 35-53Google Scholar, 37Furukawa K. Sato T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1473: 54-66Google Scholar) presents the challenge of sorting out their unique biological functions. An important question is the degree of redundancy between different members of the β4GalT family in transferring Gal to complex glycoprotein and glycolipid acceptors. To begin to address this question, we have identified N-glycan and glycolipid structures synthesized in CHO cells that express the six β4GalTs compared with mutant cells that lack β4GalT-1, β4GalT-6, or both. We have shown that mutants of the Lec20 complementation group (21Stanley P. Sallustio S. Krag S.S. Dunn B. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet... 1990; 16: 211-223Google Scholar) lack β4GalT-1 activity. In Gat−2Lec20 CHO cells, it is due to a deletion mutation that removes exons III and IV of the β4GalT-1 gene so that only the N-terminal 214 amino acids of β4GalT-1 can be synthesized. Pro−5Lec20 CHO cells have a mutation that results in extremely low steady-state levels of β4GalT-1 transcripts. The overall phenotype of both Lec20 mutants is essentially identical (21Stanley P. Sallustio S. Krag S.S. Dunn B. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet... 1990; 16: 211-223Google Scholar); and thus, it was of interest to discover that Pro−5Lec20 cells have no detectable β4GalT-6 transcripts. The β4GalT-6 deficiency in Pro−5Lec20 cells originated from the parental Pro−5 CHO cells, which are also completely devoid of β4GalT-6 gene transcripts. Therefore, we used the four cell lines to investigate the relative contributions of β4GalT-1, β4GalT-6, and the four remaining β4GalTs to in vivo Gal transfer to glycoproteins and glycolipids and to in vitro galactosyltransferase acceptor specificity for various acceptors.A summary of mutants and their properties is given in TableV. The loss of β4GalT-1 had the most profound effect on in vitro lactose synthase activity and on the transfer of Gal to the biantennary GnGn glycopeptide (Table IV). One or more of the remaining five β4GalTs transferred Gal quite efficiently to GlcNAc, tri- and tetraantennary glycopeptides, and the core 2 oligosaccharide, although β4GalT-1 provided ≥50% of the activity with these acceptors. Interestingly, β4GalT-1 did not contribute to the transfer of Gal to GlcCer in CHO cell extracts, even though recombinant β4GalT-1 uses GlcCer as an acceptor (9Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 31979-31991Google Scholar). Thin-layer chromatography of glycolipids from both the Lec20 mutant lines confirmed that β4GalT-1 does not contribute to the synthesis of LacCer or GM3 in CHO cells (Fig. 8).Table VSummary of CHO β4GalT mutantsGat−2 CHOGat−2Lec20Pro−5 CHOPro−5Lec20β4GalT transcriptsβ4GaT-1+Deletion+Few5-aAlthough Northern analysis did not detect β4GalT-1 transcripts, RT-PCR gave the expected product.β4GaT-2++++β4GaT-3++++β4GaT-4++++β4GaT-5++++β4GaT-6++AbsentAbsentNeutralN-glycans (MALDI-TOF-MS)Undergalactosylated(+)+++++++++SialylatedN-glycans (MALDI-TOF-MS)Undergalactosylated(+)+++++Glycolipid synthesis (HPTLC5-bHigh-performance TLC.)GM3 and LacCer++++++++++++++++5-a Although Northern analysis did not detect β4GalT-1 transcripts, RT-PCR gave the expected product.5-b High-performance TLC. Open table in a new tab The in vitro results with microsomal membranes suggest that β4GalT-1 is the most important β4GalT in galactosylating biantennary N-glycans (Table IV). This conclusion is supported by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of neutral and sialylatedN-glycans (Tables II and III). Gat−2 CHO cells, which express all six β4GalTs, synthesize fully galactosylated tetra- or triantennary neutral N-glycans, but have appreciable amounts of undergalactosylated biantennary N-glycans. In Lec20 mutants that lack functional β4GalT-1, almost every possible partially galactosylated N-glycan is synthesized, but the predominant species is undergalactosylated biantennaryN-glycans. Thus, β4GalT-1 is required for efficiently generating fully galactosylated bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary neutralN-glycans. Most interestingly, only a very small proportion of the partially galactosylated structures that predominate in Lec20 mutants acquire sialic acid (Table III). In fact, no biantennaryN-glycans containing 1 Gal residue capped with sialic acid were detected. This strongly suggests that the first sialic acid is not transferred by the α2,3 sialyltransferase in CHO cells until both Gal residues are present on a biantennary structure. In addition, it is apparent that only one partially galactosylated triantennary structure (SG2Gn3M3Gn2) and one tetraantennary structure (SG1Gn4M3Gn2) were present in Lec20 mutants. None of the other neutralN-glycans with 1, 2, or 3 Gal residues (see Table II) were sialylated (see Table III). Also of interest are the severalN-glycans that appear to have polylactosamine sequences among the sialylated species.The results of in vitro galactosyltransferase assays and glycan analyses reveal subtle but significant effects of the absence of β4GalT-6 in CHO cells. The Pro−5 CHO cell extract, which lacks β4GalT-6, had significantly, although slightly, reduced activity with all acceptors except GlcCer (Table IV). By far the biggest effect of the loss of β4GalT-6 in Pro−5 CHO was in the ∼44% reduced transfer of Gal to the triantennary acceptor from fetuin (GnGnβ4Gn). This was not reflected in an abundance of undergalactosylated triantennary N-glycans in Pro−5 CHO glycoproteins, however. In fact, there were only minor peaks of bi- and triantennary neutral N-glycans lacking Gal residues in Pro−5 CHO glycoproteins. By contrast, for the sialylated N-glycans, the absence of β4GalT-6 gave rise to the same species of undergalactosylated tri- and tetraantennary structures as did the absence of β4GalT-1. Thus, Pro−5 CHO cells lacking only β4GalT-6 contained only a subset of the fully galactosylated, sialylated N-glycans synthesized by the full complement of six β4GalTs in Gat−2 CHO cells. Finally, it can be seen from the spectrum of complex N-glycans synthesized in the double mutant Pro−5Lec20 that the effects of missing β4GalT-1 and β4GalT-6 are essentially additive.Perhaps the most unexpected result with cells lacking β4GalT-6 was the fact that this was not reflected in an increased amount of GlcCer due to reduced synthesis of LacCer and GM3 (Fig. 8). β4GalT-6 was called LacCer synthase when first cloned (15Nomura T. Takizawa M. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Wakisaka E. Yoshizuka N. Imokawa G. Dohmae N. Takio K. Hattori M. Matsuo N. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 13570-13577Google Scholar) and has been proposed to be a major β4GalT responsible for LacCer synthesis. Although it is true that all the β4GalTs can synthesize LacCer in vitro, β4GalT-6 and β4GalT-5 are more closely related to each other than to the other β4GalTs at the amino acid level. Thus, it may be that β4GalT-5 is the β4GalT that synthesizes LacCer in CHO cells because it is clear that neither β4GalT-1 nor β4GalT-6 is responsible. In summary, the Gal transfer properties of Gat−2 CHO cells, which express all six β4GalTs, compared with those of glycosylation mutants lacking functional β4GalT-1 (Gat−2Lec20), β4GalT-6 (Pro−5 CHO), or both (Pro−5Lec20) show that β4GalT-1 is a key enzyme for the galactosylation of complex N-glycans and that neither β4GalT-1 nor β4GalT-6 is involved in glycolipid synthesis in CHO cells (Table V).

In the present study, we show that the Ras-related GTP-binding protein Cdc42 is susceptible to caspase-catalyzed proteolysis in a number of cell lines, including NIH3T3 fibroblasts, human breast cancer cells (e.g. T47D), and COS-7 cells. Both caspase-3 and caspase-7 were able to catalyze the cleavage of Cdc42, whereas caspase-6 and caspase-8 were without effect. The susceptibility to the caspase-stimulated degradation is specific; although Rac can also serve as a caspase substrate, neither Rho nor Ras is degraded. Caspase sensitivity is conferred by a consensus sequence (DXXD) that lies immediately upstream of the Rho insert regions (residues 122–134) of Cdc42 and Rac. The removal of a stretch of residues (120) that includes the insert region or site-directed mutagenesis of either aspartic acid 118 or 121 within a constitutively active background (i.e. Cdc42(F28L)) as well as a wild-type Cdc42 background yields Cdc42 molecules that provide a marked protection against Fas ligand-induced apoptosis. Overall, these results are consistent with a model in which Cdc42 acts downstream of Fas, perhaps to influence the rate of apoptosis, with the ultimate caspase-mediated degradation of Cdc42 then allowing for a maximal apoptotic response.

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 54-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently Cdc42 has also been implicated in membrane trafficking (2Wu W.J. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) with this role being linked to its ability to induce malignant transformation. Slight perturbations in the GTP-binding/GTPase cycle of Cdc42 can give rise to a transformed phenotype (3Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 4Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and it appears that multiple target/effectors are required. Recently Cdc42 and the related GTP-binding protein Rac have been suggested to play a role in suppressing programmed cell death (5Tang Y. Zhou H. Chen A. Pittman R.N. Field J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9106-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is an intriguing possibility that at least part of the ability of Cdc42 to transform cells is linked to a circumvention of apoptosis. A possible link between Cdc42 and the suppression of apoptotic signals may be the serine/threonine kinase p21-activated kinase (PAK).1 It has been well established that PAK is a primary target for the Cdc42 and Rac GTP-binding proteins with its serine/threonine kinase activity being markedly stimulated by activated versions of the GTP-binding proteins (7Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 8Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). It has also recently been shown that PAK1 phosphorylates Bad, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family (5Tang Y. Zhou H. Chen A. Pittman R.N. Field J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9106-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In addition, PAK1 is known to stimulate NFκB activity, thus protecting cells against apoptosis (9Frost J.A. Swantek J.L. Stippec S. Yin M.J. Gaynor R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19693-19699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10Lin B. Williams-Skipp C. Tao Y. Schleicher M.S. Cano L.L. Duke R.C. Scheinman R.I. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Given the increasing indications that PAK activation leads to cell survival and evasion from apoptosis, it becomes attractive to consider a role for its upstream activator, Cdc42, in similar processes. Thus, in the present study, we examined whether Cdc42 might influence apoptotic signaling pathways, perhaps by performing some type of survival function. We show here that Cdc42 serves as a caspase substrate with the cleavage site lying just upstream of the Rho insert region. Deletion of residues 120–139 or specific point mutations at sites immediately upstream of the insert yields a Cdc42 molecule that significantly retards the ability of apoptotic stimuli (e.g.Fas ligand) to give rise to programmed cell death. COS-7 and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in a humidified 7% CO2environment in Dulbecco's modified medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The media for COS-7 and NIH3T3 cells were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The human breast cancer cell line T47D was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The media for T47D cells were supplemented with 10% calf serum. COS-7 or T47D cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 15 min at room temperature prior to use. T47D cells (1–2 × 106) were suspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 10% calf serum to minimize incubation volumes. The cells were incubated without serum for 4 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, 50 ng/ml of activating Fas ligand (FasL) (obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) were added, and cells were incubated for various periods of time. After 1 h, 2 ml of RPMI 1640 without serum were added to cells. COS-7 or NIH3T3 cells were seeded in 6-well plates in 2 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then incubated without serum for 10 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, 100 ng/ml of activating FasL were added, and cells were incubated for varying periods of time. After 2 h, 1 ml of DMEM without serum was added to adherent cells. Point mutants were generated using the polymerase chain reaction from a cDNA-encoding Cdc42 that had been subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI site of pcDNA3. The expression of recombinant proteins inEscherichia coli was performed as described previously (11Leonard D.A. Evans T. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For transient expression in COS-7 cells, the cDNAs encoding the GTP-binding proteins were subcloned into the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged pcDNA3 vector by using theBamHI/EcoRI restriction sites. For stable expression in NIH3T3 cells, constructs were subcloned into the HA-tagged pLex vector using the same restriction sites. Stable cell lines were cultured on dual-chamber microscope slides (Nunc) for 1 day in normal media and then serum-starved for 8 h. Cells were then treated with 100 ng/ml of FasL as described previously (12Gibson S. Tu S. Oyer R. Anderson S.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17612-17618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The media were removed, and the cells were placed at 4 °C and gently washed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Trypsin (1 ml) was then added to remove adherent cells. The cells were assayed for apoptosis using the Annexin V FITC apoptosis detection kit (Oncogene Research Products) according to the manufacturer's procedures. Annexin V and propidium iodine (Molecular Probes) staining were used to test for membrane blebbing as described previously (13Muscarella D.E. Rachlinski M.K. Sotiriadis J. Bloom S.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Typically ∼20 μg of lysate proteins from cells expressing HA-tagged Cdc42, Rac1, or RhoA were mixed with 50 ng of caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7, or caspase-8 in a total volume of 100 μl. Caspases were purchased from PharMingen. Reactions were carried out in a final concentration of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose, and 0.1% CHAPS. The reactions were performed at room temperature for varying times in the presence or absence of the tetrapeptide inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (200 ng). Aliquots (25 μl) were removed from the reaction mixture, and the reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min in 6× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Cdc42 and other GTP-binding proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-HA (HA 1.11) monoclonal antibody purchased from Covance Research Products. Cells (1 × 105) were plated onto 6-well plates and starved for 12 h in 1% DMEM. The cells were then lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmEGTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Fifty μg of lysate proteins were incubated with 10 μmAc-DEVD-(7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin) (purchased from PharMingen) in 1 ml of 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10% sucrose. Fluorescence was then monitored using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-5 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 505 nm. Caspase-8 activity was measured in an identical fashion but using 10 μm Ac-IETD-(7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin) (purchased from PharMingen). The activation of cellular Cdc42 was assayed as described previously (14Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) based on a procedure originally developed for Ras (15Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the cDNA for wild-type Cdc42 in the pcDNA3 vector. Cells were allowed to grow in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then starved for 4 h followed by stimulation with 100 ng/ml epidermal growth factor or 100 ng/ml FasL. Typically ∼20 min after stimulation, cells were lysed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 20 μm GTP, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotonin and then incubated with 50 μg of GST·PBD (for p21-binding domain from PAK). The cells were rocked at 4 °C for 3 h. GST·PBD was then precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads, washed three times with lysis buffer, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. It has recently been shown that the proapoptotic Bad protein can be phosphorylated by PAK1 (5Tang Y. Zhou H. Chen A. Pittman R.N. Field J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9106-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), thereby preventing its interaction with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Given that Cdc42 is a potent activator of PAK (7Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar,8Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 16Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), we set out to examine whether wild-type Cdc42 or different Cdc42 mutants might be capable of influencing apoptotic responses. Several different constructs of Cdc42 were stably transfected into NIH3T3 cells that were subsequently treated with the proapoptotic ligand FasL. We found that a Cdc42 construct (designated ΔL8) in which loop 8 from H-Ras (residues 121–127) was substituted for amino acids 120–139 in Cdc42, including a stretch of amino acids unique to Rho-related proteins but missing in Ras (the Rho insert, residues 122–134), protected cells against FasL-induced apoptosis (Fig.1). Even under conditions in which a constitutively active form of Cdc42 (Cdc42(F28L)) that is potently transforming (3Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) did not show significant protective effects, the ΔL8 deletion in a constitutively active background (designated Cdc42(F28L)ΔL8), which yielded an activated but transformation-defective Cdc42 molecule (17Wu W.J. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16655-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), showed strong protection. Moreover, the ΔL8 deletion in a wild-type background also showed substantial protection against apoptosis. The quantitation of apoptosis using Annexin V FITC/propidium iodine staining showed that under conditions in which at least 80% of the (vector) control cells underwent apoptosis following treatment with FasL, typically only 20–30% of the cells died when expressing the Cdc42ΔL8 constructs. These results suggested that the ΔL8 deletion somehow provided Cdc42 with a significant protective capability. Among the possible explanations for these findings was that Cdc42 might itself be a target for apoptotic factors (e.g. caspases) such that the ΔL8 deletion reduced the susceptibility of Cdc42 and thereby slowed the overall time course for programmed cell death. We have found that Cdc42 is subject to degradation when cells are exposed to a variety of types of apoptotic treatments. For example, upon the transient expression of HA-tagged Cdc42 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, COS-7 cells, and human breast cancer T47D cells followed by treatment with FasL, the HA-tagged Cdc42 underwent a time-dependent degradation. Fig.2 A, left panel, shows the results obtained upon treating cells with FasL and then monitoring Cdc42 by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody, whereas the right panel shows the corresponding controls (no FasL treatment). There was significant variability in the time period for degradation, depending on the cell type, with COS-7 cells requiring a much greater time period for achieving complete degradation as compared with T47D or NIH3T3 cells. This most likely reflects differences in the relative amount of caspase activity in the individual cell types. Similar results were obtained when exposing the different cell types to ultraviolet radiation. Cdc42 was significantly degraded in irradiated NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2 B), and this was also the case in T47D cells (data not shown). Rac is also susceptible to the degradation induced by apoptotic stimuli, although typically it appears to be a less effective substrate than Cdc42 (e.g. see Fig.2 B). On the other hand, we did not find either Ras or RhoA to be degraded in any of the cell types examined following treatment with apoptotic stimuli. An example is shown for the treatment of NIH3T3 cells with FasL (Fig. 2 C), and similar results were obtained with COS-7 and T47D cells (data not shown). Thus, there appears to be a rather striking selectivity in terms of the small GTP-binding proteins that are sensitive to degradation. We next examined which specific caspases cleave Cdc42 and Rac. Lysates from COS-7 cells expressing HA-tagged Cdc42 or Rac were treated with a number of different purified recombinant caspases (e.g.caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7, and caspase-8). We found that both Cdc42 and Rac were effectively degraded by caspase-3 and caspase-7, whereas neither GTP-binding protein was susceptible to caspase-6 or caspase-8 (Fig.3 A). The addition of a caspase inhibitor peptide, DEVD, to the lysates blocked the degradation of both Cdc42 and Rac (see Fig. 3 B; in these experiments, tissue transglutaminase was examined as a negative control). Overall, these findings are consistent with the notion that caspase-3 and caspase-7 are effector caspases (i.e. downstream participants in caspase cascades), whereas caspase-6 and caspase-8 typically serve as initiator caspases (18Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). We also examined whether the cleavage of Cdc42 was nucleotide-dependent and thus transiently expressed wild-type (i.e. predominantly GDP-bound) Cdc42 in COS-7 cells as well as a nucleotide-depleted Cdc42 mutant (Cdc42(T17N)) and a GTPase-defective, dominant-active Cdc42 mutant (Cdc42(Q61L)). We found that each of these Cdc42 proteins was cleaved at essentially the same rate (Fig.4). Thus, the caspase susceptibility of Cdc42 must involve a site (or sites) that is distinct from those influenced by the GTP-dependent conformational changes that underlie the molecular switch function of GTP-binding proteins.Figure 4The caspase sensitivity of Cdc42 is independent of nucleotide occupancy. Lysates from COS-7 cells transiently expressing wild-type Cdc42 (Cdc42-wt), GTPase-defective and dominant-active Cdc42 (Cdc42-L61), or nucleotide-depleted, dominant-negative Cdc42 (Cdc42-N17) were treated with 50 ng of purified, recombinant caspase-3. The degradation of the Cdc42 proteins was assessed at the indicated time periods by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have also performed experiments examining the ability of recombinant caspases to directly catalyze the degradation of recombinant Cdc42. GST-Cdc42, -Rac, and -RhoA were incubated with different purified recombinant caspases and then analyzed by Western blot analysis with anti-GST. We found that caspase-3 was able to effectively degrade Cdc42 as read out either by using an anti-GST antibody (Fig.5) or by using an anti-Cdc42 carboxyl-terminal antibody (data not shown). Under these conditions, GST-Rac was weakly degraded by caspase-3 (relative to the degradation observed for Cdc42), and GST-RhoA showed no detectable degradation. Other purified recombinant caspases, such as caspase-6 or caspase-8, were ineffective against all of the GTP-binding proteins tested. The necessity of adding caspase-7 to cellular lysates to catalyze Cdc42 degradation, coupled with the finding that purified caspase-3 effectively degrades Cdc42, suggests that caspase-7 may be acting upstream of caspase-3 in a pathway leading to Cdc42 proteolysis. Other caspases, aside from caspase-3, may also be acting downstream from caspase-7 given that both caspase-7 and caspase-3 are able to strongly catalyze the degradation of Rac in cellular lysates, whereas the direct addition of purified caspase-3 to Rac shows a significantly slower degradation. Sequence analysis of Cdc42 and Rac revealed a caspase consensus sequence (DXXD motif) located between residues 118 and 121 just upstream of the Rho insert region (Fig.6). Neither Rho nor Ras appears to contain a caspase consensus sequence, which is consistent with our findings that these GTP-binding proteins do not serve as substrates for proteolysis. We then used site-directed mutagenesis to alter the putative caspase cleavage sites on Cdc42 with the following point mutants being generated: Cdc42(D118N), Cdc42(D121N), and Cdc42(D122N). The HA-tagged wild-type Cdc42 and the HA-tagged Cdc42 mutant proteins were stably expressed in NIH3T3 cells and then analyzed for FasL-induced degradation. Both wild-type Cdc42 and the Cdc42(D122N) mutant were effectively degraded under conditions of FasL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7), whereas the Cdc42(D118N) and Cdc42(D121N) mutants were resistant to degradation.Figure 7FasL induces the degradation of Cdc42.NIH3T3 fibroblasts were stably transfected with wild-type HA-tagged Cdc42 or with the different indicated Cdc42 mutants. The cells were serum-starved for 10 h and then treated with FasL (100 ng/ml) for the indicated periods of time. The degradation of Cdc42 was then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similar results were obtained when purified caspases were added to lysates from NIH3T3 cells that stably expressed the different HA-tagged Cdc42 proteins. We found that wild-type Cdc42 and the Cdc42(D122N) mutant were susceptible to degradation stimulated by either caspase-7 or caspase-3 (Fig. 8), whereas the Cdc42(D118N) and Cdc42(D121N) mutants were resistant to degradation under each condition. The same was true when examining the ability of recombinant caspase-3 to catalyze the degradation of the different purified recombinant GST-Cdc42 proteins (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that aspartic acid residues 118 and 121 within Cdc42 are essential sites for caspase-catalyzed proteolysis. Having identified the essential sites on Cdc42 for caspase-mediated degradation, we then examined whether these caspase-insensitive mutants could influence the ability of FasL to induce apoptosis. We first established NIH3T3 cell lines that stably expressed the activated Cdc42(F28L) mutant and different Cdc42 molecules that were point-mutated within an F28L background (i.e. Cdc42(F28L/D118N), Cdc42(F28L/D121N), and Cdc42(F28L/D122N)) as we have done in the past to assess the role of Cdc42(F28L) in cell growth and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements (2Wu W.J. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 3Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16655-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fig. 9 A shows the results obtained when the different stable cell lines were treated with 100 ng/ml FasL and then scored for apoptosis using dye-binding assays (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Consistent with other results (e.g. Fig. 1), cells expressing the constitutively active Cdc42(F28L) mutant showed essentially the same susceptibility to FasL-induced apoptosis as control cells expressing vector alone. Cells expressing the Cdc42(F28L/D122N) double mutant also showed little protection against FasL-mediated cell death. However, cells expressing either of the caspase-insensitive mutants, Cdc42(F28L/D118N) or Cdc42(F28L/D121N), showed significant resistance against programmed cell death. It is interesting that similar results were obtained when the point mutations were generated within a wild-type Cdc42 background. The stable expression of either Cdc42(D118N) or Cdc42(D121N) conferred resistance to FasL-induced cell death in NIH3T3 cells, whereas the Cdc42(D122N) mutant was essentially ineffective (Fig. 9 B). This was also the case when human breast cancer cells (T47D) were transiently transfected with the corresponding cDNAs for these different Cdc42 mutants (Fig. 9 C). Fig. 10 A shows the dose-response profiles for FasL-induced apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells that stably express the various point mutants in the Cdc42(F28L) background, whereas Fig. 10 B shows the corresponding profiles for fibroblasts expressing the different point mutants in the wild-type Cdc42 background. We see that in both cases, a substantial protection is provided by Cdc42 molecules containing either the D118N or the D122N mutation at FasL levels ≤ 100 ng/ml. However, at higher levels of FasL (200 ng/ml), the protection effects are greatly diminished. Similarly, in time course experiments, the D118N and D122N mutants show substantial protection up to 24 h of treatment with 100 ng/ml FasL, whereas at longer times (≥36 h), the protective effects by the Cdc42 mutants were significantly diminished (data not shown). These data indicate that the protective effects provided by Cdc42 are not irreversible and can be overcome by increasing the strength and the time duration of the apoptotic stimuli. It has been reported that Ras has the ability to inhibit FasL-mediated apoptosis through the down-regulation of Fas expression (21Peli J. Schröter M. Rudaz C. Hahne M. Meyer C. Reichmann E. Tschopp J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1824-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 11, there is no detectable effect on Fas expression in NIH3T3 cells that express those Cdc42 mutants that give rise to protection against FasL-mediated apoptosis. Likewise, no detectable effects on the expression of the Fas-signaling participants Fas-associated death domain, caspase-3, or caspase-7 were found. We also examined whether the expression of the Cdc42 mutants that exhibited protection against FasL-induced apoptosis had any effect on the cellular activities of caspases. Fig.12, A and B, shows that FasL stimulated the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8 in NIH3T3 cells with maximal activation occurring in 3–4 h followed by a steady decline in activity, consistent with previous reports (22Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The FasL-stimulated caspase-3 activity in cells expressing each of the Cdc42 mutants tended to be higher (sometimes by as much as 50–60%) rather than lower than the activity measured in control NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 12 A). When assaying caspase-8, which is upstream of caspase-3, we did observe minor reductions in the activity compared with control cells (Fig. 12 B). However, in some experiments we found no detectable differences under conditions in which significant protection against apoptosis was provided by the D118N and D121N mutants, thus indicating that the protective effects cannot be attributed to a change in the expression or function of caspase-8. The fact that caspase-insensitive mutations in a wild-type Cdc42 background were still able to confer protection against FasL-induced apoptosis was somewhat surprising. Thus, we hypothesized that treatment with FasL is able to promote Cdc42 activation. In fact, various Rho family members including Cdc42 have been reported to be activated by FasL (19Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Brenner B. Schlottmann K. Linderkamp O. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26389-26394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Leblanc V. Delumeau I. Tocque B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have examined this under conditions in which Cdc42 is able to protect against apoptosis and found that FasL was able to induce a weak but consistent stimulation of Cdc42 activation as read out by the interaction of GTP-bound Cdc42 with the limit-binding domain of one of its primary targets PAK (Fig.13). However, the overall extent of activation of Cdc42 by FasL was significantly reduced compared with other activating ligands (e.g. epidermal growth factor (Fig.13)). Thus, it appears that FasL may only activate a small percentage of the total cellular pool of Cdc42 but that this may be sufficient to have an impact on FasL-induced apoptosis. It is becoming increasingly clear that the signaling pathways responsible for programmed cell death are every bit as complex as those signaling activities that stimulate cell cycle progression and mitogenesis. Moreover, there is every reason to believe that apoptotic ligands/factors will initiate a diversity of signaling outputs, some of which will have the expected stimulatory effects on apoptosis, whereas others will exert opposing effects, perhaps providing some modulation to the overall rate at which cell death proceeds. This is similar to what has emerged from studies of the signaling pathways responsible for mitogenesis. For example, the growth factor-dependent activation of Ras stimulates cell cycle progression but also leads to the expression of genes that negatively regulate cell growth and even contribute to apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 23Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Thus, for these reasons, we felt that it was of interest to examine how Cdc42, a Rho-related member of the Ras superfamily that has been implicated in a number of fundamental cellular processes including cell cycle progression, cell shape, and motility, influences programmed cell death. We show here that the deletion of a stretch of residues that included the Rho insert region yielded a Cdc42 molecule that was able to significantly retard the rate of apoptotic progression. We have gone on to show that immediately upstream from the insert region, Cdc42 contains an essential site for caspase-catalyzed proteolysis. The degradation of Cdc42 in cells occurs under conditions of apoptotic stimulation and appears to be specific. Rac, which is highly related to Cdc42, can also serve as a caspase substrate, but neither Rho nor Ras was degraded during Fas-mediated apoptosis in any of the cell lines examined. Mutating the essential sites for caspase-catalyzed proteolysis yields Cdc42 molecules that can markedly reduce the susceptibility of cells to apoptosis, most likely by slowing their rate of progression toward cell death. What is especially interesting is that Cdc42 molecules, which are not constitutively active but nonetheless are mutated at the caspase-sensitive sites, exhibit strong antiapoptotic effects. This effect then points to apoptotic ligands such as FasL as potentially having the capability for promoting the activation of Cdc42. Various reports have appeared suggesting that FasL and related ligands (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-α) are able to stimulate the activation of Cdc42 (18Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar, 24Subauste M.C. Van Herrath M. Benard V. Chamberlain C.E. Chuang T.H. Chu K. Bokoch G.M. Hahn K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9725-9733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We have carefully examined this under conditions in which Cdc42 influences apoptotic responses and find that FasL is able to increase the levels of activated Cdc42 in cells, but this appears to be a rather modest effect, apparently representing a small percentage of the total cellular pool of Cdc42. Therefore, in order for Cdc42 to influence Fas-mediated apoptosis, some type of signal amplification may be required. Fig. 14 depicts a working model that is consistent with the results presented here. Fas activation is shown to initiate at least two types of pathways, one that leads to the activation of caspases and a classical apoptotic response and a second that serves to oppose the apoptotic signal (i.e.similar to a survival activity). This is similar to what has been proposed for the related apoptotic ligand tumor necrosis factor-α (25Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 26Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar, 27Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). The activation of Cdc42 and/or one of its downstream effectors would be essential for the survival pathway. It appears that the effects of Cdc42 are not directed at the level of caspase expression or activation. Rather, both caspase-3 and its upstream activator caspase-8 were strongly stimulated by FasL under conditions in which caspase-insensitive Cdc42 mutants were able to provide strong antiapoptotic effects. Thus, the protective/survival effects mediated by Cdc42 must be directed at events occurring downstream from caspase activation, perhaps influencing the susceptibility of key substrates, the proteolysis of which is necessary for a full commitment to apoptosis. The ability of FasL to both initiate caspase activation and promote Cdc42-mediated survival signals might then provide for a certain time frame for the apoptotic response to occur. As caspase activation becomes maximal and the Cdc42 degradation ensues, the apoptotic signaling pathway(s) would in effect take over and allow the completion of the cell death program. The expression of the constitutively active Cdc42(F28L) mutant did not cause a significant slowing of the Fas-induced apoptotic response. However, clearly an advantage is gained by expressing Cdc42 molecules that are not susceptible to caspase-catalyzed degradation. At the present time, we have not identified the downstream Cdc42 targets that are responsible for providing a survival signal. However, two attractive candidates are PAK and NFκB, both of which have been demonstrated to participate in Cdc42-mediated signaling events and to contribute to antiapoptotic responses (5Tang Y.

Future work will be directed toward delineating the Cdc42 signaling pathways operating in Fas-induced responses and to establish whether any connection exists between Cdc42-mediated survival responses and the ability of Cdc42 to cause the malignant transformation of cells."

Initial studies failed to show expression of the CLP gene in a number of tissues and cell types (7Koller M. Strehler E.E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); however, in an independent study aimed at identifying mRNAs coding for transformation-sensitive proteins, CLP was recloned as a protein named NB1 (forNormal-Breast-1) from a normal primary breast epithelial cell line that had been subtracted with RNA purified from the same cell line after chemical transformation (8Yaswen P. Smoll A. Peehl D.M. Trask D.K. Sager R. Stampfer M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7360-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). CLP was subsequently shown to be expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner in basal and suprabasal epithelial cells of the normal breast, cervix, prostate, and skin, and to be down-regulated in naturally occurring breast, cervix, and prostate tumors as well as in artificially immortalized and transformed breast epithelial cells in culture (9Yaswen P. Smoll A. Hosoda J. Parry G. Stampfer M.R. Cell Growth Diff. 1992; 3: 335-345PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, CLP was found to be down-regulated in 80% of primary breast tumors of both noninvasive as well as invasive and metastatic stages (10Rogers M.S. Foley M.A. Crotty T.B. Hartmann L.C.

Given the apparent correlation between its down-regulation and the tumorigenic state, the available data support the notion that CLP expression may be incompatible with the transformed state of a cell. The mechanism responsible for this incompatibility is presently unknown, as is the physiological function of CLP, though they are likely related. calmodulin-like protein calmodulin hemagglutinin resonance units nitrilotriacetic acid base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid yellow fluorescence protein polymerase chain reaction glutathioneS-transferase Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline blue fluorescence protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polyvinylidene difluoride nucleotide(s) Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 plus CaCl2 open reading frame CLP's deduced amino acid sequence of 148 residues is identical in length and shows 85% identity to calmodulin (CaM) (7Koller M.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12826-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Accordingly, CLP shows a number of characteristics similar to those of CaM; however, it also displays unique features that suggest its functional divergence (11Rhyner J.A. Koller M. Durussel-Gerber I. Cox J.A. Strehler E.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12826-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12Durussel I. Rhyner J.A. Strehler E.E. Cox J.A.

Biochem. 1994; 226: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For example, CLP displays a Ca2+-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift that is typical of CaM, and it binds four Ca2+ as does CaM, albeit with an ∼8-fold lower affinity (11Rhyner J.A. Koller M. Durussel-Gerber I. Cox J.A. Strehler E.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12826-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12Durussel I. Rhyner J.A. Strehler E.E. Cox J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6089-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Purified CLP is able to fully activate several known CaM-regulated enzymes, including CaM kinase II and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (although theK m for CLP activation of the phosphodiesterase is higher than that for CaM). By contrast, CLP is ineffective at stimulating other CaM-dependent enzymes such as calcineurin, NO synthase, and smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (11Rhyner J.A. Koller M. Durussel-Gerber I. Cox J.A. Strehler E.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12826-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Edman C.F. George S.E. Means A.R. Schulman H. Yaswen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). At present there are no known CaM targets that show higher affinity for CLP than for CaM. On the other hand, the unique expression pattern of CLP and its possible involvement in specific cellular processes (e.g. cell differentiation) raise the possibility that it may have its own distinct targets. Knowing the identity of the proteins with which CLP normally interacts will greatly aid in understanding the normal physiological function(s) of CLP as well as the consequences of its down-regulation in transformed cells. Here, we therefore set out to identify such proteins using gel overlays and yeast two-hybrid interaction screening, and report the cloning and characterization of a human unconventional myosin (myosin X) as a specific target of CLP. Human CLP was expressed in Escherichia coli JM109(DE3) from plasmid pGem-CLP and purified as described (14Qian H. Rogers M.S. Schleucher J. Edlund U. Strehler E.E. Sethson I. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis (15Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) was performed to generate an expression vector for CLPF99Y in which phenylalanine 99 was replaced by tyrosine. A 475-bp EcoRI/BamHI cassette from pGem-CLP was first subcloned into M13mp18. Recombinant phage were propagated inE. coli RZ1032, and uracil-containing single-stranded DNA was isolated for in vitro hybridization to the mutant oligonucleotide 5′-d(GCG CTG ACG TAG CCG TTG CC)-3′. The hybrid was elongated by T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase 2.0, United States Biochemical Corp.) ligated by T4 ligase and transformed into E. coli JM101. The mutated cassette was then excised from double-stranded replicative form DNA of an appropriate M13 clone and religated into EcoRI/BamHI-digested pGem-CLP, yielding expression vector pGem-CLPF99Y. CLPF99Y was expressed as described (14Qian H. Rogers M.S. Schleucher J. Edlund U. Strehler E.E. Sethson I. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). CLPF99Y was radiolabeled using “Enzymobeads” according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad, Brussels, Belgium) in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% glucose (w/v), and 1 mCi of Na125I/100 μg of recombinant protein. The specific activity was ∼1.5 × 106 cpm/μg protein. For biotin labeling, purified recombinant CLP was dissolved at 12 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm CaCl2, and biotin X-NHS (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was dissolved at 20 mg/ml in Me2SO. Biotin solution was added to the CLP solution to 20% (v/v), and the mixture incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was then quenched by adding ammonium acetate to 1m, and labeled CLP was separated from free label by gel filtration using Sephadex G-25 (Sigma). Breast and cervix tissues from biopsy specimens, and lung from autopsy were obtained from Drs. C. Moll and R. Caduff (Department of Pathology, University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland). 1 g of tissue was minced with a razor blade and homogenized with a Polytron at 4 °C in 4 ml of 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm KCl, 10 mm1,4-dithio-dl-threitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was passed through four layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged for 1 h at 24,000 × g and 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and stored at −20 °C until use. For overlays, protein samples were run in SDS-PAGE gels and blotted to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using standard Western blotting procedures (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar). Blotted membranes were incubated for 5 min in CaTBST (2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) + 1.5% H2O2, and blocked overnight in 5% nonfat dry milk in CaTBST. Membranes were probed in 105 cpm/ml (5–10 nm) of iodinated CLPF99Y or in 75 nm biotinylated CLP in CaTBST for 90 min, and then washed four times (5 min each time) in CaTBST, and exposed to Fuji x-ray film at −70 °C if 125I-labeled CLPF99Y was used. If biotin-labeled CLP was used, the blot was probed with biotin-avidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:3000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed as before, and developed using RenaissanceTM chemiluminescent reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). pAS2-CLP and pAS2-CaM were made by subcloning a NcoI/XbaI fragment carrying the entire coding sequence from pKK-CLP and pKK-CaM, respectively (11Rhyner J.A. Koller M. Durussel-Gerber I. Cox J.A. Strehler E.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12826-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), into pAS2–1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). pGADGH-IQ123K corresponds to the original plasmid isolated from the HeLa Matchmaker cDNA library (CLONTECH). It contains nt 2333–2674 of the human myosin X sequence (accession no. AF234532) fused with a linker of sequence 5′-d(GAA TTC GGC ACG AG)-3′ at the 5′ end and 5′-d(GAG CTC (T)15)-3′ at the 3′ end to the pGADGH vector at cloning sites EcoRI and XhoI, respectively. The resulting vector expresses amino acids 705–817 of myosin X as a C-terminal fusion protein with the yeast Gal4 activation domain. In addition, the myosin X sequence is followed by lysines resulting from the oligo(dT) primer used in library construction as well as a few extra C-terminal residues encoded by the vector. pGADGH-IQ0 was constructed by deletion of an ApaI fragment from this construct and expressed amino acids 705–751 of myosin X in frame with the Gal4 activation domain. pGADGH-IQ1, -IQ12, and -IQ123 were constructed by amplifying appropriate fragments from pGADGH-IQ123K using a pGADGH-specific upstream primer and downstream primers terminating at nt 2511 (IQ1), nt 2579 (IQ12), or nt 2674 (IQ123). The resulting PCR products were cut with BamHI (cuts within the upstream pGADGH sequence), and then cloned into pBluescript, which had been cut with EcoRV, T-tailed, and BamHI cut. TheBamHI/XhoI inserts from this vector were then transferred to pGADGH. The resulting constructs expressed amino acids 705–763 (IQ1), 705–785 (IQ12), or 705–817 (IQ123) of myosin X in fusion with the Gal4 activation domain. pEGFP-HA-His and pEBFP-HA-His were constructed by inserting a double-stranded oligonucleotide with the (top strand) sequence 5′-d(pGAT CCT ACC CCT ATG ATG TGC CTG ACT ATG CCC ACC ACC ACC ACC ACC ACC TGG TGC CCA GGG GCA GCA)-3′ into theBspEI site of plasmids pEGFP and pEBFP (CLONTECH), thereby reconstituting theBspEI site at the 3′ end only, and introducing the peptide sequence SYPYDVPDYAHHHHHHLVPRGSR, which contains an HA tag followed by a His tag, to the C terminus of the GFP/BFP tag. The full-length myosin X coding sequence from nucleotide position 233 to 6405 (accession no.AF234532) was then cloned as a KpnI/XbaI fragment from pBluescript-MyoX into pEBFP-HA-His, creating plasmid pEBFP-HA-His-MyoX, which expresses the human myosin X with an N-terminal BFP, HA, and His tag. pEYFP-CLP and pEYFP-CaM were constructed by PCR amplification using pKK-CLP and pKK-CaM (11Rhyner J.A. Koller M. Durussel-Gerber I. Cox J.A. Strehler E.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12826-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as templates together with primers pKK233–2K (5′-d(GTG AGC GGA TAA CAG GTA CCC ACA GGA AAC AG)-3′) and pKK233–2r (5′-d(CCG CCA AAA CAG CCA AGC TTG CAT GCC TG)-3′). The KpnI/XmaI fragment from each PCR product was then ligated into pEYFP (CLONTECH). In-frame GST fusion constructs GST-IQ1, GST-IQ12, and GST-IQ123 were made by amplifying sequences corresponding to nt 2344–2511 (IQ1), 2344–2579 (IQ12), or 2344–2674 (IQ123) of myosin X from plasmid pGADGH-IQ123K, TA-cloning the resulting PCR fragments into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and subcloning the EcoRI insert fragments from this vector into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All vector inserts were completely sequenced to confirm their integrity. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed according to the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 2 instructions (CLONTECH). Yeast were transformed using the lithium acetate method (17Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar) with sheared herring sperm DNA as carrier. Selection of initial positives was done after 14 days of growth on SD/−Trp/−Leu/−His agar plates. 5 mm or 40 mm 3-aminotriazole (Sigma) was added to all −His media used for yeast strains CG1945 or Y190, respectively. Positive clones were propagated on SD/−Trp/−Leu media. Yeast media components were from CLONTECH and Difco. β-Galactosidase assays were performed by freeze-thaw of yeast colonies on filter lifts of 3-day-old streak plates. Bait plasmid was dropped out by cycloheximide counterselection, using concentrations of 1 and 10 μg/ml for strains CG1945 and Y190, respectively. Yeast matings were performed in liquid culture using microtiter plate volumes and yeast strains Y187 (mating type α) and either Y190 or CG1945 (a-type). Plasmid inserts from positive yeast clones were directly amplified after picking 3-day-old yeast colonies into TE containing 0.25 unit/μl lyticase (Sigma). Following 2 h at 37 °C, the yeast were subjected to three rounds of freeze-thaw and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. They were then chilled on ice, pelleted, and the supernatant used as template for PCR with pGADGH-specific primers. Library plasmids were prepared from counterselected yeast containing only “prey” plasmids by an alkaline lysis method (18Klee, C. B., Vanaman, T. C., Adv. Protein Chem., 35, 1982, 213, 321.Google Scholar) and transformed directly into E. coli strain DH5α. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed on HeLa cell Marathon-Ready cDNA as recommended by the supplier (CLONTECH), using nested primers 5′-d(GTC TTC CCC AGC TGC CAC TCG CTG TTG G)-3′ and 5′-d(AGG CAT CAT AGA GCT GCA GCA GGC TCG)-3′ based on the sequence from the yeast two-hybrid clones. This resulted in a ∼2-kb PCR product, which was sequenced directly using a primer walking strategy and extended through the initiator codon and ∼30 bp of the 5′-untranslated region of the myosin X cDNA. The entire 6-kb human myosin X open reading frame (ORF) was then PCR-amplified using information from this sequence and from human ESTs homologous to bovine myosin X sequence. Because the 6-kb PCR product proved resistant to standard cloning techniques, we cloned the myosin X ORF cDNA in pieces, which were then reassembled. The 3′-most 2 kb of the ORF were amplified from Marathon-Ready cDNA usingTaq DNA polymerase and cloned as anEcoRI/XbaI fragment into pBluescript. The 5′-terminal 4 kb of the ORF was amplified from Marathon-Ready cDNA using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and cloned as a KpnI/EcoRI fragment into pBluescript. This fragment contained two mutations, one of which resulted in a frameshift and was corrected by site-directed mutagenesis using the GeneEditor kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The 3′ fragment was then subcloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of this vector. The resulting full-length cDNA in pBluescript (pBluescript-MyoX) contains one discordance from the original sequence (accession no. AF234532), an A → G transition at base 2261, which results in an arginine for glutamine substitution at amino acid 679. During all PCR reactions, DNA polymerase was not added until the tubes reached 94 °C (hot start PCR). GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) from pGEX-2TK derived vectors upon isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction as described (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted, resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) plus protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm EDTA) and 30 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and lysed by the addition of sarkosyl (Curtis-Matheson Scientific, Houston, TX) to a final concentration of 1.5%. After 15 min on ice, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g and supplemented by the addition of Triton X-100 to 3%. This lysate was then bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Sigma) and washed with TBST and Tris-buffered saline. The quantity of bound fusion protein was estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels of known amounts of fusion protein-containing glutathione-Sepharose beads, and glutathione-Sepharose was added to equalize the amount of fusion protein/ml of beads among various fusions. Varying amounts of CLP or CaM were mixed with glutathione Sepharose beads containing equal quantities (∼5 μg) of GST-IQ123, GST-IQ12, GST-IQ1, or GST alone in the presence of 5 mmCaCl2 (Ca) or 5 mm EDTA in TBST and allowed to bind overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with CaTBST or with 5 mm EDTA in TBST and solubilized in Laemmli buffer (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar). These samples were then analyzed by Western blot for CLP using affinity-purified rabbit anti-human CLP antibody TG-7, or for CLP/CaM using unpurified TG-7 antiserum, which recognizes both CLP and CaM equally well (10Rogers M.S. Foley M.A. Crotty T.B. Hartmann L.C. Ingle J.N. Roche P.C. Strehler E.E. Neoplasia. 1999; 1: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance analysis was performed on a BIAcore 1000 instrument using Sensor Chip SA (streptavidin) chips (Biacore Inc, Piscataway, NJ). Affinity was measured for the N-terminally biotinylated IQ3 peptide (biotin-RFLHLKKAAIVFQKQLRGQIARRVYRQ-NH2) synthesized in the Mayo peptide core facility. Approximately 1000 RU of peptide were bound to the chip, and varying CLP and CaM concentrations were passed over the chip. The concentration of purified CLP (14Qian H. Rogers M.S. Schleucher J. Edlund U. Strehler E.E. Sethson I. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) was measured by UV absorbance at 276 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 1500m−1 (11Rhyner J.A. Koller M. Durussel-Gerber I. Cox J.A. Strehler E.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12826-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Bovine brain CaM was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and quantitated by UV absorbance at 276 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 3300m−1 (19Klee C.B. Vanaman T.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 213-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). CLP and CaM were diluted from 0.1 mm stocks immediately prior to sensorgram runs. All sensorgram runs were performed in a running buffer of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% w/v NaN3, 0.005% Surfactant P-20 (Biacore Inc.), and 1 mmCaCl2. Regeneration was performed using running buffer with 2 mm EDTA in place of CaCl2 and was complete as determined by comparing blank buffer injections to 1 μminjections of CLP or CaM. Sensorgrams were blank subtracted and baseline-adjusted, then RU at equilibrium were measured. For each of three experiments, a Scatchard plot was done and thex-intercept of a least squares fitted line was calculated. Each point in that experiment was then normalized to thex-intercept (i.e. divided by the value of thex-intercept and multiplied by 100), all data points were pooled, and a Scatchard plot representing all three experiments was plotted. Least squares fitting was then used to calculate a best fit line, and the affinity of CLP for the IQ3 peptide was estimated from the slope of that line. Kinetic rate constants were not estimated because analysis of flow rate dependence of the apparent rate constants demonstrated that CLP binding was mass transfer limited up to a flow rate of 100 μl/min. COS-1 cells were obtained from Dr. John T. Penniston (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and supplemented with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (all cell culture reagents from Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected at ∼80% confluence using Qiagen (Valencia, CA) purified plasmid DNA and LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. Plasmids pEYFP, pEYFP-CLP, or pEYFP-CaM were cotransfected with either pEBFP-HA-His or pEBFP-HA-His-MyoX, using a DNA ratio of 1:8 (w/w). Cells were grown for 2 days post-transfection, washed three times in DPBS (Life Technologies, Inc.) and scraped into lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 2 mmCaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (NaDOC), 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 100 μg/ml Pefabloc (Roche), 40 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml aprotinin). Either Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) or anti-HA-agarose beads (Roche) were added to the lysate, and the lysate was rocked end-over-end for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed once with lysis buffer and four times with CaTBST, and finally resuspended in Laemmli buffer containing 5 mm EDTA. Precipitated proteins were detected by Western blot using anti-GFP antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), which recognize both YFP and BFP. MCF-7 cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with purified plasmid DNA as described above. Transfected cells were grown for 2 days, then rinsed in DPBS (Life Technologies, Inc.) and fixed for 20 min in 0.1 mPIPES (pH 6.95), 1 mm EGTA, 3 mmMgSO4, 3% formaldehyde. Coverslips were then rinsed three times (3 min each time) in DPBS, permeabilized for 2 min in 0.2% Triton X-100 (Curtis-Matheson Scientific), and blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% v/v normal goat serum and 2% w/v BSA in DPBS). Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h in primary antibody (polyclonal rabbit anti-HA IgG, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) diluted 1:50 (10 μg/ml) in blocking buffer, rinsed three times in DPBS, and incubated for 1 h in secondary antibody (5 μg/ml Alexa-350 goat anti-rabbit IgG; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 25 ng/ml rhodamine-phalloidin (Sigma) in blocking buffer. Following three rinses in DPBS and a final rinse in dH2O, coverslips were mounted with ProLong (Molecular Probes) on glass slides. To identify specific CLP targets in total tissue extracts, we used a gel overlay method proven to be successful in the identification of CaM target proteins in various tissues and subcellular fractions (20Billingsley M.L. Polli J.W. Pennypacker K.R. Kincaid R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 451-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Pujol M.J. Bosser R. Vendrell M. Serratosa J. Bachs O. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1422-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Bachs O. Agell N. Carafoli E. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In previous studies with CaM, the best results were obtained when 125I-labeled protein was used as probe. Unfortunately, in CLP a Phe residue replaces the Tyr99 iodinated in CaM, leading to a dramatic reduction in the success of CLP iodination. We therefore engineered (by site-directed mutagenesis) a CLPF99Y expression construct. Purified CLPF99Y was then labeled with 125I to a high specific activity and used as probe in overlay experiments, assuming that the single conservative amino acid replacement would not lead to a major change in target binding specificity. This approach identified a relatively small number (two to four major bands) of putative CLP-binding proteins in human breast, cervix, and lung (Fig.1). The most prominent was a protein with an estimated molecular mass of 210 kDa. This protein (p210) was also detected by biotinylated CLP (data not shown), confirming that detection does not result from the F99Y substitution. p210 reacted only weakly or not at all with CaM in the overlays (Fig. 1). CLP-binding proteins, including a band for p210, were also detected in the 100,000 × g microsomal membrane fraction from cultured HeLa cells (Fig. 2 A), as well as from several other normal and transformed epithelial cell lines (data not shown). Importantly, the 210-kDa protein interacted with CLP in a specific, Ca2+-dependent manner; labeled CLP could be competed off the blot with excess unlabeled CLP, but not with unlabeled CaM (Fig. 2), and binding was detected in the presence of Ca2+, but not in the presence of EDTA (data not shown). We turned to the yeast two-hybrid approach (23Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) to identify CLP interacting proteins and to potentially clone the p210 protein. We used the MatchmakerTM yeast two-hybrid system (CLONTECH) to screen an oligo(dT)-primed, directionally cloned HeLa cell cDNA library with a CLP “bait” fused in frame to the Gal4 DNA binding domain in the plasmid pAS2–1 (CLONTECH). Screening 1.7 × 107initial transformants yielded 1070 colonies, of which 266 were β-galactosidase positive in a colony lift assay. Following cycloheximide counterselection to cure strains of the bait plasmid, two colonies for each β-galactosidase-positive transformant were mated against Y187 yeast cells containing bait plasmids coding for CLP or a laminin fusion protein (nega"
https://openalex.org/W2060291416,"The anti-tumorigenic and anti-proliferative effects ofN-α-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) have been known for more than three decades. Yet little is known about the discrete cellular targets of TPCK controlling these effects. Previous work from our laboratory showed TPCK, like the immunosuppressant rapamycin, to be a potent inhibitor of the 70-kilodalton ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), which mediates events involved in cell growth and proliferation. We show here that rapamycin and TPCK display distinct inhibitory mechanisms on S6K1 as a rapamycin-resistant form of S6K1 was TPCK-sensitive. Additionally, we show that TPCK inhibited the activation of the related kinase and proto-oncogene Akt. Upstream regulators of S6K1 and Akt include phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). Whereas TPCK had no effect on either mitogen-regulated PI 3-K activity or total cellular PDK1 activity, TPCK prevented phosphorylation of the PDK1 regulatory sites in S6K1 and Akt. Furthermore, whereas both PDK1 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) are required for full activation of the 90-kilodalton ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), TPCK inhibited RSK activation without inhibiting MAPK activation. Consistent with the capacity of RSK and Akt to mediate a cell survival signal, in part through phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, TPCK reduced BAD phosphorylation and led to cell death in interleukin-3-dependent 32D cells. Finally, in agreement with results seen in embryonic stem cells lacking PDK1, protein kinase A activation was not inhibited by TPCK showing TPCK specificity for mitogen-regulated PDK1 signaling. TPCK inhibition of PDK1 signaling thus disables central kinase cascades governing diverse cellular processes including proliferation and survival and provides an explanation for its striking biological effects.

Cells respond to a vast array of extracellular cues that direct their intracellular activities and ultimately govern their fates. Such guided regulation fashions and maintains complex and highly specialized tissues in multicellular organisms. However, the misregulation or misinterpretation of such signals can spell disaster for an organism and is the molecular basis for a number of disease states such as cancer, autoimmunity, tissue degenerative disorders, and developmental abnormalities. These extracellular cues include numerous soluble and cell-tethered ligands for which responsive cells express receptors. For ligands regulating such diverse processes as cell growth, proliferation, motility, survival, and differentiation, the “AGC” family of serine/threonine kinases provides critical links between the extracellular signals and their intracellular effector molecules (1Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R93-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 2Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev.

AGC kinases are so-named as they include protein kinase A (PKA),1 protein kinase G (PKG), protein kinase C (PKC), and their nearest kinase relatives. Although AGC kinases share high structural conservation in their kinase domains, they exhibit rich disparity in the surrounding regulatory regions. This permits similar kinase activities to respond to a spectrum of molecular messengers mobilized by extracellular signals. Despite such diversity, one critical step in the activation of AGC kinases is highly conserved: phosphorylation of their autoinhibitory activation loops. The activation loop is a structural feature found throughout the greater kinase superfamily (5Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). In their inactive state, the activation loops of many kinases block the access of substrate to the catalytic core of the enzyme. However, once phosphorylated, the activation loop is displaced and substrate is no longer sterically or electrochemically excluded (6Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) has recently been shown to phosphorylate the activation loops of a growing number of its own AGC kinase family members. These include Akt or protein kinase B (PKB) (7Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr.

Additionally it autophosphorylates its own activation loop (22Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Recent work using PDK1−/− embryonic stem cells demonstrated the necessity for PDK1 in insulin-like growth factor-1 activation of Akt and S6K1 and in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) activation of RSK. However, lysates from these cells showed no loss in PKA activation implying that PDK1 was required for full activation of Akt, S6K1, and RSK, but PKA could be regulated via a PDK1-independent mechanism (23Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). As total PDK1 kinase activity in cells appears largely unaffected by growth factor stimulation, the rate-limiting steps in PDK1 phosphorylation of AGC kinases involve regulation of their steric and spatial accessibility to PDK1 (1Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R93-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 3Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

Our current understanding of the molecular mechanics of this accessibility shows rich complexity when considering the four best-studied PDK1-activated enzymes: Akt, S6K1, RSK, and PKC isoforms. Akt is activated following the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K). PI 3-K activity generatesd3-phosphoinositides. Two of these products, PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, bind to the Akt amino-terminal pleckstrin homology domain and exert a dual activating effect. First, this binding of PI 3-K lipid products relieves structural auto-inhibition and exposes the Akt activation loop to PDK1 (24Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Second, as PDK1 harbors a carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, which also binds PI 3-K lipid products, PI 3-K activity co-localizes Akt and PDK1 at the plasma membrane leading to rapid Akt activation following stimulation (1Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R93-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 3Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5712-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). S6K1 and RSK likewise appear to require stimulus-regulated exposition of their activation loops. Unlike Akt, however, S6K1 and RSK do not contain pleckstrin homology domains. However, their interaction with PDK1 appears more stable than the interaction between PDK1 and Akt as S6K1 and RSK have been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with PDK1 (11Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J.

PKC isoforms also interact directly with PDK1 (11Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.-S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but activation loops of conventional PKC isoforms appear to be freely accessible to PDK1 in unstimulated cells. Thus PDK1 is able to phosphorylate them co-translationally (30Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10697-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Full activation of conventional PKCs is obtained after subsequent agonist-dependent steps (30Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10697-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The development of specific inhibitors of AGC kinase members or of their proximal regulators has been critical in defining their individual roles in signal transduction. More broadly, inhibitors of AGC kinases are being pursued as clinical therapeutics. The fungal macrolide rapamycin is a potent immunosuppressant and inhibits the activation of S6K1. Rapamycin is now being evaluated in phase III clinical trials for its ability to synergize with another mechanistically different immunosuppressant, cyclosporin A, in reducing acute rejection of transplanted tissue (31Kahan B.D. Julian B.A. Pescovitz M.D. Vanrenterghem Y. Neylan J. Transplantation. 1999; 68: 1526-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). As S6K1 mediates important events for cell growth and proliferation (32Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 33Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr.

Cancer Surv. 1996; PubMed Google Scholar), the immunosuppressant activity of rapamycin may be due, at least in part, to its inhibition of S6K1. To more fully understand the biological role of S6K1, we previously evaluated the effect of the enzymatic inhibitors N-α-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) and N-α-tosyl-l-lysyl chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) on S6K1 activation given their known anti-proliferative and anti-tumorigenic capacity (35Troll W.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, like rapamycin, TPCK (and less potently, TLCK) inhibited the activation of S6K1 by multiple agonists. However, TPCK, but not rapamycin, inhibited S6K1 activation in rapamycin-resistant T-cell lines (41Grammer T.C. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23650-23652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This suggested that TPCK and rapamycin inhibited S6K1 via distinct molecular mechanisms. To elucidate potentially novel regulatory mechanisms acting on S6K1 or its upstream activators and to define more precisely the molecular mechanisms whereby TPCK exerts its potent biological effects, we sought to identify the cellular target(s) of TPCK that control the mitogenic activation of S6K1. E1A-transformed human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293E) cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Swiss3T3 (S3T3) cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 5% calf serum. NIH3T3 cells harboring Myr-Akt-HA-MER (a gift of R. Roth) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and 0.4 μg/ml G418. 32D cells (a gift of M. Meyers) were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% WEHI-conditioned media as a source of IL-3. C2C12 myoblasts harboring either empty vector pMV7 or pMV7-HA-S6K1 were generated by D. Fingar and J. Blenis and were maintained in 20% FBS and 0.4 mg/ml G418. All cells were maintained in the presence of penicillin (20 inhibitory units/ml) and streptomycin (20 μg/ml) as antibiotics. Transfection of HEK 293E cells was by calcium phosphate precipitation with the total amount of DNA per transfected 60- and 100-mm dish between 3 and 5 μg and 6 and 10 μg, respectively. After 4–6 h exposure to the precipitate, cells were washed once with DMEM and then treated as indicated in the figure legends. For HEK 293E cells, S3T3 cells, NIH3T3 cells harboring Myr-Akt-HA-MER, and C2C12 myoblasts harboring HA-S6K1, cells were washed once with serum-free DMEM and then returned to the same for 24 h prior to drug treatment and stimulation as indicated in the figure legends. For 32D cells, the cells were washed three times in 10–15-ml volumes of RPMI and then incubated in the same for 3–4 h prior to drug treatment and stimulation as indicated in the figure legends. Cell lysis, immune complex kinase assays (RSK, Akt, S6K1), and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (42Shimamura A. Ballif B.A. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 127-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). PDK1 kinase assays were performed as for RSK, Akt, and S6K1 except that protein G-Sepharose was used to immunoprecipitate Myc-tagged PDK1 proteins, a GST-PKCζ fragment was used as substrate, and kinase reactions were allowed to proceed for 15–20 min. Assays in Fig. 6 Eevaluating the direct effect of TPCK on PDK1 in vitro were performed as follows using baculovirus-purified His6-PDK1 (a gift from A. Toker). Master mixes of His6-PDK1 (25–50 nm) were incubated with either ethanol or 250 μm TPCK at room temperature for 30 min in kinase buffer without ATP. The final concentration of ethanol did not exceed 3%. Subsequently, 20 μl of each master mix were aliquoted into tubes containing 10 μl of a substrate mix consisting of kinase buffer, ATP, and various concentrations of GST-PKCζ as indicated in the figure legends. Kinase assays were allowed to proceed for 15 min before the addition of 10 μl of 4× sample buffer. Samples were boiled and analyzed as indicated in the figure legends. For PKA assays, 5 μl of cleared lysate were used in a 30–40-μl kinase reaction using 8-Bromo-cAMP (Sigma) and protein kinase inhibitor (Sigma catalog #8140) as indicated in the figure legends. GST-BAD S112A/S136A and GST-BAD S136A were used as substrates as indicated. PI 3-K assays were performed essentially as described previously (43Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% IGEPAL (Nonidet P-40), 25 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium PPi, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Anti-phosphotyrosine immune complexes were collected using protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), were washed twice with lysis buffer without NaF, ZnCl2, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and pepstatin A, and were then washed twice with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 137 mm NaCl. Immune complexes were subjected to lipid kinase reactions for 5 min at room temperature in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. PtdIns (Avanti) and PtdIns-4-P (Sigma) were used as substrates with phosphatidyl-serine (Avanti) as a carrier. The reactions were terminated by adding 1.2 volume of 2m HCl, and lipid products were then extracted using a 1:1 mixture of CHCl3 and CH3OH. Finally, lipid products were resolved using thin layer chromatography. Drug treatments were performed as described in the figure legends with ethanol as the solvent for each drug except for wortmannin and LY294002 where the solvent was dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Vehicle treatment in all cases was ethanol. Drugs and activators were from the following sources: TPCK (Sigma and Calbiochem), wortmannin (Sigma), LY294002 (Eli Lilly), rapamycin (Wyeth-Ayerst Research), 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (Sigma), EGF (Life Technologies, Inc.), insulin (Sigma), IL-3 (R & D Systems). Commercial antibodies were from the following sources: anti-Akt (UBI catalog no. 06–608 for immunoprecipitation and no. 06–617 for immunoblotting), anti-phosphotyrosine (UBI no. 05–321), anti-Akt-phosphothreonine-308 and anti-Akt-phosphoserine-473 (NEB). Anti-PDK1 and anti-PKCζ-phosphothreonine-410 antibodies were gifts from A. Toker. Anti-PKCβ-phosphothreonine-500 antibodies cross-reacting with S6K1-phosphothreonine-229 were a gift from A. Newton. Antibodies raised against S6K1 (44Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) and RSK1 (45Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Bio. 1996; 16: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) were described previously. Anti-PI 3-K p85 antibodies were a gift of L. Cantley. Results presented are representative of two or more independent experiments. HEK 293E were transfected as described above. 6 h after transfection, cells were washed once with serum-free DMEM and returned to DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 20 h. The media was then aspirated and cells were placed in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 4 mCi/10-cm dish of [32P]orthophosphate (ICN no. 64013). Cells were radiolabeled for 100 min prior to drug treatments as indicated in the figure legends. For IL-3 withdrawal-induced apoptosis, 32D cells were washed three times in 10–25 ml of RPMI and resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS without WEHI-conditioned media for 13–18 h. Cells were then washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 40 mg/ml of propidium iodide and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Dead cells stained positive for propidium iodide. For TPCK-induced apoptosis cells were washed as described above and then starved of IL-3 for 2–3 h prior to adding the concentrations of drug indicated in the figure legends. After incubation with a drug for 20 min, cells were given recombinant IL-3 (0.5 ng/ml) and then assayed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting as described above. pKH3-HA-S6K1 ΔNT/CT (27Romanelli A.

The pGEX-3X-GST-PKCζ fragment was generated by cutting full-length PKCζ (rat) using a 5′-internal BglII site and a 3′-vector EcoRI site and ligated to pGEX-3X digested with BamHI andEcoRI. pCDNA3-Myc-PDK1 S241E (human) was generated using the QuikChange approach (Stragene) and introduced an internalEcoRI site. pCMV6-HA-Akt1 (murine) and pCMV6-Myr-Akt1-HA were gifts of P. Tsichlis. pCDNA3-HA-Akt1 T308A was a gift of A. Toker. pCDNA3-Myc-PDK1 and pCDNA3-Myc-PDK1 K111I were gifts of P. Hawkins. A rapamycin-resistant form of S6K1 was described previously (46Cheatham L. Monfar M. Chou M.M. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and was generated by deletion of its amino and carboxyl termini (S6K1 ΔNT/CT). The basis for the rapamycin resistance of this allele is proposed to be due to the deletion of a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-binding region in S6K1 thus preventing PP2A negative regulation of S6K1. PP2A is itself negatively regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (47Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of rapamycin the mammalian target of rapamycin is unable to repress PP2A allowing PP2A to bind to and inactivate wild type S6K1 but not S6K1 ΔNT/CT. To determine whether TPCK and rapamycin employed different methods in their inhibition of S6K1, we asked if the rapamycin-resistant S6K1 was sensitive to TPCK. This mutant was transiently expressed in E1A-transformed HEK 293E cells, and its activation was found to be rapamycin-resistant but TPCK-sensitive (Fig. 1) confirming the distinct inhibitory mechanisms of rapamycin and TPCK on S6K1. Akt has been shown to positively regulate S6K1 when constitutively activated by the addition of a membrane-targeting myristoylation sequence (48Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11937-11943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This alteration of Akt approximates the Gag-Akt fusion found in its transforming viral homologue v-Akt (49Bellacosa A. Testa J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N. Science. 1991; 254: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). A biological connection between Akt and S6K1 was further suggested as targeted disruption of the Drosophila alleles of Akt and S6K1 give strikingly similar small fly phenotypes (50Verdu J. Buratovich M.A. Wilder E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 51Montagne J. Stewart M.J. Stocker H. Hafen E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 1999; 285: 2126-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether Akt activation is also prevented by TPCK. Pretreatment of HEK 293E cells with TPCK inhibits insulin activation of Akt to an extent comparable with the inhibition seen with the PI 3-K inhibitor wortmannin (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained using Swiss3T3 (S3T3) cells (data not shown). The concentration of TPCK required to fully inhibit Akt and S6K1 in S3T3 cells and HEK 293E cells was between 25 and 50 μm. The IC50 for Akt in S3T3 cells was half the IC50for Akt in HEK 293E cells when compared directly (data not shown). The biochemical properties of halomethyl ketones such as TPCK make them effective, irreversible alkylating agents. Alkylation occurs when the structure of the target protein can simultaneously accommodate the drug and bring it into the proximity of the R-group of either a histidine or cysteine residue. TPCK alkylation of histidine occurs at position 1 of the imidazole ring (52Powers J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 46: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas for cysteine TPCK alkylation occurs at the sulfhydryl group (53Kupfer A. Gani V. Jimenez J.S. Shaltiel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3073-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine whether TPCK is an irreversible inhibitor of Akt activation, S3T3 cells were pretreated with increasing amounts of TPCK or the reversible PI 3-K inhibitor, LY294002 (54Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Brown R.F. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Heyworth P.G. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Marder P. Schelm J.A. Rothfuss K.J. et al.J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2413-2422PubMed Google Scholar). Following treatment, the cells were either washed or maintained in the presence of the inhibitors during a subsequent stimulation with insulin for 30 min. As opposed to the reversible effect seen with LY294002, the effect of TPCK on Akt activation was irreversible (Fig. 2 B), implying that TPCK was alkylating either Akt directly or one of its upstream activators. Inhibition of S6K1 and Akt by similar concentrations of TPCK suggested that TPCK was inhibiting an upstream regulator common to both S6K1 and Akt. S6K1 and Akt share at least two upstream activators, PI 3-K and PDK1 (2Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). The effect of TPCK on PI 3-K was first analyzed. PI 3-K (Class IA) signaling is initiated by the association of the 110-kilodalton catalytic subunit (p110)/85-kilodalton regulatory subunit (p85) heterodimer with phosphotyrosine residues on activated receptor complexes. This brings the heterodimer into proximity of substrate at the plasma membrane. This association occurs rapidly following mitogenic stimuli (3Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). As a relatively small"
https://openalex.org/W2004160285,"HER2 oncogene overexpression has been associated either with proliferation or differentiation and apoptosis. The role of p53 on these different chances was investigated. Wild type (wt) p53-IGROV1 cells showed growth inhibition and apoptosis after HER2 transfection, whereas no anti-proliferative effect was observed in its mutated p53 sub-line unless wt p53 was cotransfected with HER2. Stable HER2 transfectants derived from wt p53 line treated with heregulin-β1 or epidermal growth factor showed a decrease in proliferation due to a G2/M cell cycle block despite normal mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. In these HER2 transfectants, c-Myc and p53 expression were increased, whereas MDM2 was dramatically down-modulated. By contrast, growth factors stimulation of HER2 transfectants with mutated-p53 induced progression through the cell cycle. Together, our data point to a regulatory role for p53 in HER2 signaling.

HER2 overexpression is a frequent event in several human cancers, including breast tumors, and has been correlated with a poor prognosis (1Slamon D.J. Press M.F. Godolphin W. Ramos L. Shek L.

HER2 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor-related family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which comprises HER1, HER2, HER3, and HER4 (5Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys.

The four proteins are normally coexpressed in various combinations and can form homo and heterodimers, which are activated in response to a number of peptide factors (7Wallasch C. Weiss F.U.

The substrates of the MAPK cascade include transcriptional factors such Jun, Fos, and c-Myc (10Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G.

Nevertheless, we recently reported that HER2 transfection resulted in decreased plating and cloning efficiency, decreased growth rate, inhibition of entry into the S-phase of the cell cycle, and differentiation (15Giani C.

In breast cancer cells, the mechanism of growth inhibition and differentiation via HER2 receptor activation has been suggested to involve p53 (18Bacus S.S. Yarden Y. Oren M. Chin D.M. Lyass L. Zelnick C.R. Kazarov A. Toyofuku W. Gray-Bablin J. Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. Nikiforov M. Haffner R. Gudkov A. Keyomarsi K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2535-2547PubMed Google Scholar), and HER2 overexpression in breast cancer, associated with increased proliferation, is frequently found in tumors with p53 alterations (19Ménard S. Casalini P. Tomasic G. Pilotti S. Cascinelli N. Bufalino R. Perrone F. Longhi C. Rilke F. Colnaghi M.I. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 55: 169-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the relevance of p53 status for the activity of HER2 in promoting proliferation using HER2-transfected cells that differ in p53 status. We show here that p53 status greatly influences the effect of HER2 overexpression in tumor cells in promoting either proliferation or apoptosis or blocking proliferation. The IGROV1 cell line was originally derived by Dr. Bernard (Institute Gustave Roussy, Villejuf, France) from a moderately differentiated ovarian carcinoma of an untreated patient. IGROV1/Pt1, kindly provided by Dr. F. Zunino (Istituto Nazionale Tumori), was generated by continuous exposure of IGROV1 cells to increasing concentrations of cisplatin (20Perego P. Giarola M. Righetti S.C. Supino R. Caserini C. Delia D. Pierotti M.A. Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Zunino F. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 556-562PubMed Google Scholar). All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2 in air) in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HyClone) and 2 mml-glutamine (Sigma). All transfected cells were cultured as above, except that the culture medium also contained G-418 (Geneticin) (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 200 μg/ml in the case of HER2-transfected IGROV1 and IGROV1/Pt1 cells or mock-transfected cells. Plasmids pcDNA/HER2 and pEGFP/HER2 were prepared by excising full-length human HER2 cDNA from the LTR-2/erbB-2 expression vector (kindly provided by Dr. P. Di Fiore) (14Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Kraus M.H. Segatto O. King C.R. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1987; 237: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar) by XhoI digestion (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and subcloning the fragment into the XhoI restriction site of plasmid pcDNA1/neo (Invitrogen) in the case of pcDNA/HER2 or into pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH) in which the cloned cDNA was expressed as a fusion product with the N terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the case of pEGFP/HER2. Full-length p53 cDNA, excised by BamHI digestion of plasmid pC53-SN3 (21Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K.V. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar), was subcloned into plasmid pIREShyg (CLONTECH) and designated pIRES/p53. Stable transfections were conducted with pcDNA/HER2, and transient transfections were conducted with pEGFP/HER2. For stable transfections, cells at 80% confluence in serum-free medium were transfected with 30 μg of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for selection control or with 30 μg of Lipofectin plus 3 μg of plasmid. Cells were left at 37 °C for 5 h and, after replacement of serum-free with complete medium, maintained for an additional 48 h. Cells were trypsinized and plated in the presence of 400 μg/ml G-418 until all nontransfected cells were dead. Individual G-418-resistant colonies were picked, expanded, and maintained in the presence of G-418 (200 μg/ml). Control cells were transfected with pcDNA1/neo only (“mock”). Individual colonies as well as bulk cultures of G-418-selected cells were tested for p185HER2 surface expression by FACScan analysis. For transient transfection, the same Lipofectin/DNA ratio as for stable transfections was maintained; cells were seeded in duplicate chamber slides (Lab-Tek) and, 24 h later, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. After a wash with PBS, nuclei were stained with 25 μg/ml Hoechst reagent (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Either the percentage of transfection or apoptosis was evaluated by visual count under a fluorescence microscopy. Cells were seeded in duplicate chamber slides (Lab-Tek) and, at 80% confluence, transiently cotransfected. Each well received 0.2 μg of each plasmid and 2 of μg of Lipofectin in serum-free medium. The plasmid combinations used were empty pEGFP-C2 and pIREShyg, pIRES/p53 and empty pEGFP-C2, pEGFP/HER2 and empty pIREShyg, and pIRES/p53 and pEGFP/HER2. Cells were kept at 37 °C for 5 h and, after replacing serum-free with complete medium, maintained in culture for 24 h and treated as described for transient transfections. Cells were transfected with either pcDNA1/neo or pcDNA/HER2 (same Lipofectin/DNA ratio as for stable tranfection) and plated in duplicate 6-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well). After 48 h, medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 300–800 μg/ml G-418, depending on the cell line. After 3 weeks of selection, plates were stained with TB methylene blue (Difco) for 15 min. Colonies were counted, and the percentage of control colony formation was calculated. Trypsin-detached cells were incubated for 45 min at 0 °C with 10 μg/ml anti-p185HER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) MGR6 (22Centis F. Tagliabue E. Uppugunduri S. Pellegrini R. Martignone S. Mastroianni A. Ménard S. Colnaghi M.I. Hybridoma. 1992; 11: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in PBS containing 0.03% bovine serum albumin. After several washes, cells were further incubated for 45 min at 0 °C with fluorescein-linked goat anti-mouse antibody (Kierkegaard and Perry Laboratories). After washing, cells were assessed for fluorescence using a FACScan flow cytometer with LYSIS TM II software (Becton-Dickinson). Cells were seeded at 10 × 103 cells/well in 96-well plates in 200 μl of culture medium and grown for 1, 2, 3, and 6 days. Each test was performed in six replicates. Briefly, cells were fixed by incubation with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 1 h followed by 5 washes with distilled water. Cells were stained by the addition of 1% acetic acid, 0.4% (w/v) SRB (Sigma) solution to the culture medium at room temperature; after 30 min, plates were washed with 1% acetic acid and air-dried. After the addition of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 10.5, to dissolve the SRB bound to cellular proteins, absorbance at 550 nm, proportional to the number of cells attached to the culture plate, was measured by spectrophotometry. Cells were seeded at 10 × 103/well in 96-well plates in complete medium for 3 h. Cells were then serum-starved for 48 h and treated with 10 ng/ml HRGβ1 (NeoMarkers) or 20 ng/ml EGF (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 24 h and with 1 μCi/well [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1 mCi/ml for the last 4 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and solubilized in 100 μl of 0.2 n NaOH, 1% SDS. Lysates were neutralized with 100 μl of 0.2 n HCl, and incorporated radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting. Cells (5 × 103/well) were seeded in 6-well plates in semisolid medium containing 0.3% Bacto-Agar (Difco) supplemented with 30% fetal calf serum and 300 μg/ml G-418 over a 0.6% agarose layer. Colonies were scored after a 3-week incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. Cells were cultured for 48 h in serum-free medium and treated with 10 ng/ml HRGβ1 or 20 ng/ml EGF for 24 h at 37 °C or left untreated. Cells were harvested, fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of RNase A (1 mg/ml; Sigma) and stained for 30 min at 0 °C with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) in PBS containing 0.03% bovine serum albumin. Fluorescence was measured using a FACScan flow cytometer with LYSIS TM II software, and data were analyzed with CellFIT software (all Becton Dickinson). Cells were scraped and lysed in hot SDS buffer (0.125 nm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). For each sample, 50–100 μg of total protein extract was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were incubated with the primary antibody for 2 h followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse Ig (1:5000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the supplier's instructions. For MAPK studies, cells were cultured for 48 h in fetal calf serum-free medium and treated with 10 ng/ml of HRGβ1 or 20 ng/ml EGF for 10 min at 37 °C. After treatment, cells were lysed for 45 min on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm Na3VO4. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Total lysate (50 μg) was resolved in a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and blotted as described above. mAbs used were anti-p185HER2 Ab-3 (1 μg/ml; Oncogene Science), anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (4 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), p53-DO7 (1:100, Novocastra Laboratories Ltd.), anti-MDM2 Ab-1 (1 μg/ml, Calbiochem), c-Myc Ab-5 (1 μg/ml Neo Markers), p44/42 MAPK antibody (1:1000; BioLabs Inc.), Phospho-p44/42MAP kinase (Thr-202/Thr-204) antibody (1:1000, BioLabs Inc.), and anti-actin clone AC40 (1:500, Sigma). RNA was extracted using the Talent RNA extraction kit (Talent s.r.l.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (10 μg/sample) was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and immobilized by UV-cross-linking. Hybridization was carried out using a [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) random-primed (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) probe comprising full-length p53 cDNA, obtained by BamHI digestion of pC53-SN3 (21Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K.V. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). After stripping, membranes were hybridized with a control [32P]dCTP β-actin probe (24Gunning P. Ponte P. Okayama H. Engel J. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis was performed by PhosphorImager scanning using the ImageQuant System (Molecular Dynamics). IGROV1 ovary carcinoma cells, which carry wt p53, and the cisplatin-resistant variant IGROV1/Pt1, carrying a p53 mutated at codons 270 and 282, were transfected with a HER2 expression vector. Colony assay revealed dramatic inhibition in the growth of IGROV1 transfectants as compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig.1 A), whereas the clonogenic potential of the mutant p53 IGROV1/Pt1 transfectants was comparable with that of mock controls. To determine whether the reduced colony formation in HER-2-transfected wt p53-bearing cells reflected apoptosis, IGROV1 and IGROV1/Pt1 cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector in which HER2 cDNA was fused to the N terminus of GFP and the number of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained apoptotic nuclei in the green-fluorescing cells was evaluated (Fig. 1 B). HER2-transfected IGROV1 cells underwent a significantly higher rate of apoptosis than did the mock-transfected cells (p = 0.009); indeed, 31% of green-stained HER2-transfected IGROV1 cells were apoptotic versus 11% of green-stained GFP-transfected cells. By contrast, the percentage of IGROV1/Pt1 apoptotic cells was similar (10–11%) after either HER2 or mock transfection. In HER2-transfected IGROV1/Pt1 cells transiently cotransfected with wt p53 cDNA, the apoptotic rate was significantly (p = 0.025) increased (32%) as compared with the rate with single vectors alone (Fig. 1 C). Together these data indicate that HER2 ectopic expression induces apoptosis only in cells with wt p53. The in vitro growth properties of stable transfectants derived from IGROV1 and IGROV1/Pt1 cells were evaluated. FACScan analysis revealed comparable levels of HER2 expression in two IGROV1 clones (#5, #11) and two IGROV1/Pt1 clones (#24, #35), randomly selected among those with high HER2 expression, (Fig.2 A). Note that nontransfected IGROV1/Pt1 cells spontaneously displayed a higher membrane HER2 level than did IGROV1 cells. Both the IGROV1/HER2 clones displayed a lower proliferation rate, as evaluated by SRB analysis (Fig. 2 B, left) and [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 2 B,right), than mock-transfected cells. By contrast, HER2 expression conferred an evident growth advantage to IGROV1/Pt1 cells as compared with mock transfectants. In an anchorage-independent colony-forming assay, the capacity of HER2-transfected IGROV1 cells to form clones in soft agar was dramatically diminished (90% reduction). To determine whether the mitogenic pathway primed by HER2 stimulation was activated, transfectants were treated with HRGβ1 or EGF, and cell lysates were probed for MAPK activation (Fig.3 A). The addition of either ligand to IGROV1/HER2 #5 induced a higher activation (2- and 2.8-fold with HRGβ1 and EGF, respectively) of MAPK than in mock-transfected cells (1.4- and 1.9-fold). In IGROV1/Pt1 transfectants, either treatment activated both mock (2- and 3-fold) and IGROV1/Pt1/HER2 #24 transfectants (2.5- and 3.5-fold). Analysis of cell cycle progression in HER2- or mock-transfected cells after treatment with HRGβ1 or EGF revealed an increase in the percentage of S phase cells and a corresponding decrease in G2/M phase cells, except in IGROV1/HER2 #11, where both treatments induced a decrease in S phase and an increase in G2/M phase cells (Fig. 3 B). Western analysis indicated a dramatic increase in p53 levels in both IGROV1/HER2 clones as compared with the mock transfectants, whereas in IGROV1/Pt1 cells, in which a high level of p53 was already present before HER2 transfection, no difference in p53 levels was detected after transfection (Fig.4 A). Northern analysis indicated that p53 mRNA levels of IGROV1/HER2 #5 normalized to β-actin were 5 times higher than those of IGROV1/mock cells, whereas p53 mRNA levels of IGROV1/Pt1 transfectants were almost the same as in the mock controls and comparable to levels in IGROV1/HER2 cells (Fig. 4 B). Western analysis indicated a dramatic down-modulation of MDM2 protein in IGROV1/HER2 #5 cells as compared with IGROV1/mock; in IGROV1/Pt1 cells, MDM2 levels were very low in both mock and HER2 transfectants. The relative p53 protein levels are shown to emphasize that low MDM2 expression is associated with high p53 expression (Fig. 4 C). On the other side, HER2 transfection led to increase in c-Myc protein levels in IGROV1 cells; conversely, this was not observed in IGROV1/Pt1 cells (Fig.4 D). In this paper, we demonstrate that p53 status greatly influences the final effect of HER2 overexpression in tumor cells in promoting proliferation or apoptosis and a block in proliferation. Indeed, HER2 overexpression was associated with proliferation only in tumor cells with mutated p53. By contrast, HER2-transfected cells bearing wt p53 became apoptotic shortly after transfection, and after stabilization of apoptosis-resistant cells, showed decreased proliferation. These data are consistent with a p53-dependent block of the cells in response to an excess of HER2 signaling induced by transfection. The treatment with HRGβ1 or EGF induced MAPK activation in the HER2-transfected lines, indicating that the transfected HER2 was functional and the mitogenic pathway mediated by HER2 was primed, but some molecules downstream of MAPK shift the signal from induction to inhibition of proliferation. Although MAPK activation is usually correlated with proliferation, HER2-transfected cells expressing wt p53 and treated with HRGβ1 or EGF, which activated MAPK, led to decreased cell proliferation. Apparently, cells were blocked in G2/M phase of the cell cycle. HER2-transfected IGROV1 cells expressing wt p53 showed increased p53 mRNA and protein. The increased p53 protein expression was not due to a mutation acquired during culture leading to lower turnover (25Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 250-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Indeed, IGROV1/HER2 cells still underwent apoptosis after treatment with a p53-dependent apoptotic agent such as mitomycin C, whereas IGROV1/Pt1 cells did not (data not shown). MDM2 is an important component of the p53 degradation pathway and is a target for transcriptional transactivation by p53 (26Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7637-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In normal cells, low levels of inactive p53 protein are maintained by the MDM2 protein, which blocks p53 transcriptional activity in the nucleus and shuttles p53 into the cytoplasm for degradation by the cytoplasmic proteasome (27Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In tumor cells, mutations of p53 abrogate not only the tumor suppressor activity but also the ability to activate MDM2 expression. As a result, mutated p53 proteins are unusually stable and accumulate in tumor cells (25Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 250-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In keeping, accumulation of mutated p53 in both HER2- and mock-transfected IGROV1/Pt1 cells corresponded to nearly undetectable levels of MDM2. P53 protein levels rise in response to many stimuli such as stress or DNA damage, and p53 activation induces a cell cycle block or apoptosis (28Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar, 29Dou Q.P. An B. Will P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9019-9023Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In HER2-transfected IGROV1 cells, where p53 expression was dramatically increased, MDM2 protein levels were nearly undetectable. The observed G2/M cell cycle block in IGROV1/HER2 cells is consistent with recent studies suggesting that p53 regulates the G2 checkpoint in the cell cycle (30Park M. Chae H.D. Yun J. Jung M. Kim Y.S. Kim S.H. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 542-545PubMed Google Scholar). In cells with wt p53 and aberrant HER2 signaling, p53 might act as a positive control and block the cells in G2/M phase. In cells with mutated p53, such control on HER2 is absent, followed by proliferation in response to excess HER2 signaling. P53 levels are also indirectly regulated by p14Arf, which binds to MDM2 protein, sequesters it, and consequently induces its degradation (31Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Yarbrough W.G. Cell. 1998; 92: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). p14Arf is transcriptionally regulated by c-Myc (27Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Furthermore c-Myc has recently been proposed as a primary effector of HER2-mediated activity (32Neve R.M. Sutterluty H. Pullen N. Lane H.A. Daly J.M. Krek W. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that the signaling pathway of HER2 is regulated by p53 via c-Myc. In keeping, c-Myc levels were found increased in HER2-transfected IGROV1 cells. Concerning IGROV1/Pt1 cells both mock- and HER2-transfected cells, c-Myc levels were high, consistent with high HER2 expression levels in IGROV1/Pt1 mock cells already present before HER2 transfection. The presence of mutated p53 in IGROV1/Pt1 might determine the positive selection of HER2-expressing cells in which the proliferative effect of this oncoprotein is not contrasted by p53. The control of HER2 signaling by p53 provides an explanation for the association between HER2 overexpression and alteration of p53 in breast carcinomas in vivo (19Ménard S. Casalini P. Tomasic G. Pilotti S. Cascinelli N. Bufalino R. Perrone F. Longhi C. Rilke F. Colnaghi M.I. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 55: 169-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and could have implications for treatment with herceptin, since treatment should be more effective in tumors with mutated p53. Together, our data point to the importance of p53 regulation in the HER2-signaling pathway and suggest that the repair of p53 function might counter the tumor aggressiveness associated with HER2 overexpression.

The precise functions of PACAP in the development of germ cells are uncertain, but cycle- and stage-specific expression may augment cAMP-regulated gene expression in germ cells and associated Sertoli cells. Here we report the existence of a heretofore unrecognized exon in the extracellular domain of the PACAP type 1 receptor (PAC1R) that is alternatively spliced during the spermatogenic cycle in the rat testis. This splice variant encodes a full-length receptor with the insertion of an additional 72 base pairs encoding 24 amino acids (exon 3a) between coding exons 3 and 4. The PAC1R(3a) mRNA is preferentially detected in seminiferous tubules and is expressed at the highest levels in round spermatids and Sertoli cells. Analyses of ligand binding and signaling functions in stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing the two receptor isoforms reveals a 6-fold increase in the affinity of the PAC1R(3a) to bind PACAP-38, and alterations in its coupling to both cAMP and inositol phosphate signaling pathways relative to the wild type PAC1R. These findings suggest that the extracellular region between coding exons 3 and 6 of PAC1R may play an important role in the regulation of the relative ligand affinities and the relative coupling to Gs (cAMP) and Gq (inositol phosphates) signal transduction pathways during spermatogenesis.

PACAP1 is a paracrine signaling peptide that functions as a neurotransmitter, a neurotrophic factor, and a secretagogue for insulin, catecholamines, and pituitary hormones (reviewed in Ref. 1Vaudry D. Gonzalez B.J. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 269-324PubMed Google Scholar). PACAP is synthesized in the form of a precursor (proPACAP) and is processed into active peptides of either 27 (PACAP-27) or 38 (PACAP-38) amino acids, differing by an 11-amino acid extension at the carboxyl terminus. High levels of PACAP are produced by the germ cells of the rat testis (2Arimura A. Somogyvari-Vigh A. Miyata A. Mizuno K. Coy D.H. Kitada C.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3228-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Part of the diversity in PACAP actions is due to the existence of multiple receptors. Three distinct genes encode receptors capable of interacting with PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 isoforms at physiological concentrations. The PACAP-specific type 1 receptor and the PACAP receptors type 2 and 3, which also bind vasoactiveintestinal peptide (VIP), and are therefore referred to as VIPR1 (VPAC1R) (11Ishihara T. Shigemoto R. Mori K. Takahashi K. Nagata S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 811-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 12Sreedharan S.P. Patel D.R. Huang J.X. Goetzl E.J. Biochem. Biophys.

Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 53-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) has a markedly higher affinity for PACAP and does not function as a VIP receptor at physiological concentrations. All three receptors are seven-transmembrane-spanning domain G protein-coupled receptors that stimulate adenylate cyclase activity. However, the PAC1R also stimulatesphospholipase C (PLC), leading to the accumulation of inositol phosphates and diacyl glycerol. The VPAC1R and VPAC2R may also couple to PLC in some cells (16MacKenzie C.J. Lutz E.M. McCulloch D.A. Mitchell R. Harmar A.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Acta. 1997; 1357: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Multiple receptor isoforms are generated by alternate splicing of the PAC1R mRNA. Two 81-bp exons (“hip” and “hop”) are alternatively spliced within the third intracellular loop and play a role in modulating inositol phosphate responsiveness (18Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C.

Similarly, a variant of the receptor lacking the fourth and fifth exons encoding sequence in the extracellular domain has been described in hypothalamus and pituitary (20Pantaloni C. Brabet P.

The loss of 21 amino acids from the extracellular ligand-binding domain results in an increased affinity for PACAP-27. Other variants of the type I PACAP receptor have also been described (21Svoboda M. Tastenoy M. Ciccarelli E. Stievenart M. Christophe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Chatterjee T.K. Sharma R.V. Fisher R.A. J. Biol.

Here we describe a novel PAC1R splice variant highly expressed in the testis and consisting of the insertion of a 72-bp exon encoding 24 amino acids in the extracellular ligand-binding domain. This alternatively spliced exon substantially alters PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 ligand binding affinities and the relative coupling of the receptor to the cAMP-coupled and inositol phosphate-coupled signal transduction pathways. Oligonucleotides specific for the PAC1R were (forward) PRF-7 (5′-aagcaccatggccagagtcc-3′), PRF-79 (5′-gcagcgagtggacagtggcagg-3′), PRF-70 (5′-gcatcttcaagaaggagcaagc-3′), PRF-215 (5′-ccttgtaagctgccctgaggtct-3′), PRF-426 (5′-ggagatcaggattattactacctg-3′); (reverse) PRR-282 (5′-acctatggtttctgtcatccaga-3′), PRR-552 (5′-gcgagtgcaatgcagcttcc-3′), PRR-1256 (5′-caccttccagctcctccatttcC-3′), PRR-1404 (5′-ctcaggtggccaagttgtcg-3′), PRR-1465 (5′-cttcctttgggaggagcccagcttcctacc-3′), DP1 (5′-ggaaacacttcttctccagcactgcaccta-3′). Oligonucleotides specific for the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor were (forward) FRF-11 (5′-ggaatctgtggaagtttttgacg-3′) and (reverse) FRR-2196 (5′-atggcctgctcttcagaagg-3′). Oligonucleotides specific for PACAP (testis-specific isoform) were (forward) PCPTF-32 (5′-agatttccaagatacggctcaacttcatgc-3′) and (reverse) PCPR-1120 (5′-cggtagctggcaactcatcg-3′). Oligonucleotides specific for SOX-17 were (forward) SOX-17F1 (5′-atctagtgagcagcacctcc-3′) and (reverse) SOX-17R1 (5′-gcttcatgcgcttcacctgc-3′). Whole cell RNA was extracted with TriZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. RNA, in 10 μl of H2O, was combined with 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)16 and heated to 65 °C for 10 min, then cooled on ice. RT buffer, dNTPs (50 μm each), dithiothreitol (5 mm), SuperScript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) enzyme (50 units), and H2O were added for a total volume of 40 μl, and reactions were incubated at 42 °C for 40 min. All PCRs were performed in 50-μl reactions using 2 μl of cDNA template. Reactions contained 20 pmol each of forward and reverse primers, 0.2 mm each of dNTPs, and 2.5 units of thermostableTaq polymerase (TaKaRa Biomedical Inc., Berkeley, CA). For nested PCR reactions, a second reaction with nested primers was carried out using 2 μl of the first reaction as template. PACAP receptor PCR from cDNA in Figs. 1 and 3 A was carried out in two rounds with primers PRF-79 and PRR-1256 followed with primers PRF-70 and PRR-552. The first round of PCR used 10-s denaturation at 94 °C, 20-s annealing at 58 °C, and a 2-min extension at 72 °C for 20 cycles. The second round was identical except for a shorter extension time (1 min) and 30 cycles. PAC1R(3a) PCR from cDNA in Fig.3 B was carried out using the same protocol, but with a different primer pair for the first round (PRF-79 and PRR-1465).Figure 3Tissue distribution of alternatively spliced exon 3a of PAC1R. A, RT-PCR analysis of several PAC1R-expressing tissues from rat, and the rat INS-1 cell line. The PAC1R and PAC1R(3a) PCR products on an electrophoresis gel stained with ethidium bromide are indicated by arrows at 482 and 554 bp, respectively (top). Identity of the PAC1R(3a) product of 554 bp was confirmed by Southern blotting and hybridization with the oligonucleotide probe DP1 (bottom). B, RT-PCR products obtained from RNA in fractions of rat testis cells separated by sedimentation velocity. The cell types were identified by RT-PCR analyses of products expressed predominantly in major cell types, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor in Sertoli cells, SOX-17 in pachytene spermatocytes, and PACAP in round spermatids. Nested PCR for PAC1R appears in the lower panel. The PAC1R(3a) product is indicated by an arrowhead. The results shown are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cloning of the full-length PAC1R and PAC1R(3a) was done withPfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the primer pairs PRF-79 and PRR-1465, followed by PRF-7 and PRR-1404. Second round extension time was increased to 2 min, but other parameters remained as described above. For PACAP (PCPTF-32 and PCPR-1120) and SOX-17 (SOX-17F1 and SOX-17R1): 10-s denaturation at 94 °C, 20-s annealing at 58 °C, and 1-min extension at 72 °C for 25 cycles. For follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, FRF-11 and FRR-2196: 10-s denaturation at 94 °C, 20-s annealing at 58 °C, and 2-min extension at 72 °C for 30 cycles. The intron between coding exons 3 and 4 was amplified from rat genomic DNA with the primers PRF-215 and PRR-285 and a 1:50 mixture of Pfu and standardTaq polymerase. A “touchdown” PCR protocol was used, with cycling parameters of 2-s denaturation at 94 °C and 3-min extension at 72 °C for 5 cycles, followed by 2 s at 94 °C and 3 min at 67 °C for 30 cycles. For Southern hybridization, PCR products were transferred to MagnaGraph membrane (Micro Separations Inc., Westboro, MA) by capillary transfer. Hybridization with [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotide probes was done in a solution of 5 × SSC, 1% SDS, 10× Denhardt's, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 3 h at 37 °C. Blots were washed to a maximum stringency of 0.5 × SSC at 52 °C. Products of RT-PCR reactions were cloned into pCR2.1 by TA cloning (Original TA cloning kit: Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To facilitate ligation, products amplified with Pfu polymerase were purified and treated with standardTaq polymerase for 10 min at 72 °C in the presence of dNTPs. Sequencing was carried out with reagents from a Sequenase 2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequencing gels were exposed to Kodak film, from which scanned images were generated on a computing densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Nucleotide sequences were interpreted from gel images using DNA codes software (PDI Imageware Systems, New York City). The PAC1R and PAC1R(3a) were subcloned into pCR 3.1 (Invitrogen). Linearized constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells, and stably expressing cells were selected by exposure to G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 0.2–1.0 mg/ml. Cell lines used in experiments described in the legends to Figs. 4 and 5 were selected on the basis of a similar maximal binding of 125I-PACAP-27 by an identical number of cells. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM: Life Technologies) + 10% FCS.Figure 5Model of PACAP-38 interaction with PAC1R. PACAP-38 contains three potential receptor interaction domains, labeled 1 to 3 from the amino to the carboxyl terminus. Only two of the binding domains can engage concurrently, and only one conformation leads to receptor activation and G protein release. In PAC1R(3a), the second, weak-activating conformation may be favored over the first. Thus, the affinity of PACAP-38 for the PAC1R(3a) is increased without an accompanying increase in second messenger signaling over the entire range of receptor occupancy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) HEK293 cells stably expressing the receptors were harvested with trypsin and transferred to receptor binding buffer (RBB: 138 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with 0.1% BSA. Approximately 20,000–50,000 cells were used per binding reaction. For details of binding reactions, see Kiefferet al. (24Kieffer T.J. Heller R.S. Unson C.G. Weir G.C. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5119-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 125I-PACAP-27 (30,000 cpm) and competing unlabeled peptide were added followed by a 30-min incubation, a single wash in RBB, 0.1% BSA, and determination of bound labeled peptide in an Apex automatic γ counter (Micromedic Systems Inc.). Stable cell lines in 10-cm dishes were transfected with reporter plasmid pCRE-luc and control plasmid pRSV-β-galactosidase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) 18 h prior to assay. Immediately following transfection, the cells were trypsinized and replated in 24-well plates. At the time of assay, cells were transferred into DMEM + 0.1% BSA, and agonist (PACAP-27 or PACAP-38; Novabiochem, San Diego, CA) was added in a range of concentrations (10−11m through 5 × 10−6m and an unstimulated control). Luciferase activity was quantified after a 6-h incubation using the Promega luciferase system in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Results shown in Fig. 4, A and B, are from single experiments, with each treatment performed in quadruplicate. Inhibitor compounds H89 and U73122 (Calbiochem) were used to verify the predominance of the cAMP pathway in pCRE-luc activation. Stably expressing cell lines were plated into 24-well plates at matching densities and cultured for 24–48 h prior to assay. In the 24 h preceding assay, the media were substituted with inositol-free DMEM + 10% FCS containing 3 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). At the time of assay, wells were washed twice in DMEM + 0.1% BSA and incubated for 40 min in 0.8 ml of DMEM + 0.1% BSA containing 10 mm LiCl and a predetermined concentration of agonist (PACAP-27 or PACAP-38; Novabiochem). Reactions were terminated by replacing the media with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. Wells were scraped and transferred to 1.5-ml tubes. Recovered precipitate was extracted with 0.5 ml of chloroform and neutralized with 10 μl of 0.1 m NaOH. Extraction of total inositol phosphates was performed by a modified chromatographic procedure using AG1-X8 resin (Bio-Rad) prepared in 10 mm myo-inositol. 400 μl of the supernatant was added to ∼100 μl of resin and gently mixed at room temperature for 20 min. The resin was washed twice with 1 ml of 60 mm sodium borate, 5 mm borax. Inositol phosphates were eluted with 200 μl of 2 m ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid and quantified by scintillation counting. Results shown in Fig. 4,A and B, are from single experiments performed in quadruplicate. Receptor effects on intracellular calcium were investigated in the stably transfected HEK293 cells, stimulated with PACAP-27 or PACAP-38 at 100 nm. Measurements of intracellular calcium were carried out according to the methods described in Ref. 25Holz G.G. Leech C.A. Heller R.S. Castonguay M. Habener J.F. J. Biol.

Separation of testis cells was achieved by velocity sedimentation at unit gravity in a STAPUT chamber based on the method of Bellve (26Bellve A.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 84-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Briefly, a single testis from adult rat was dissociated to single cells by sequential digestion in collagenase (5 mg/ml: Sigma) and trypsin/DNase I (5 mg/ml and 1 μg/ml: Sigma and Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were centrifuged at 800 × g for 2 min and then resuspended in DMEM + 10% FCS and sieved through a 100-μm mesh strainer. Cells were collected by centrifugation once more and resuspended in 60 ml of enriched Krebs-Ringer buffer with 0.5% BSA. This suspension was introduced into a 23-cm diameter STAPUT chamber, followed by a 2.1-liter gradient of 2–4% BSA in enriched Krebs-Ringer buffer. Separation was carried out at 4 °C for 2–3 h. The apparatus was then drained and the contents collected into 120-ml fractions. Cells were concentrated by centrifugation, and early fractions not containing significant amounts of cells were discarded. Samples were taken from each remaining fraction and processed for RT-PCR as described above. Cultures of adult Sertoli cells used for RT-PCR analysis were prepared from rat testes by sequential digestion as above, followed by selection of adherent cells by plating in DMEM + 10% FCS on plastic culture flasks. The cells were trypsinized and replated after 24 h in culture, and again after 72 h, to reduce germ cell contamination. The Sertoli cells were further purified by one or two rounds of trypsinization and replating, and in some cases by culture in media containing 3 μg/ml cytosine arabinofuranoside to suppress fibroblast growth. The hydrophobicity profile (Fig.2 B) was generated with Protean 3.14 (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). The Km and EC50 values (Table I), and associated confidence intervals, were calculated with Prism 2.0.1 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).Table ILigand binding affinities, cAMP formation, and inositol phosphate production by wild type (PAC1R) and alternatively spliced variant (PAC1R(3a)) PACAP receptors in response to PACAP isopeptidesPACAP-27PACAP-38PACAP-(6–38)KmPAC1R7.53 nm5.18 nm189 nmPAC1R(3a)8.21 nm0.85 nm98.3 nmNSDp < 0.05p< 0.05EC50 (cAMP)PAC1R4.92 nm1.38 nmPAC1R(3a)8.29 nm27.4 nmp < 0.05p < 0.05EC50 (IP)PAC1R2.49 nm21.1 nmPAC1R(3a)31.2 nm53.4 nmp < 0.05p < 0.05NSD = no significant difference; IP = inositol phosphates.

PCR primers were designed to detect the existence of different isoforms of PAC1R mRNA following a nested PCR protocol. Distal primers encompassing a region including all of the extracellular domain and transmembrane domains were used for initial DNA amplification, followed by proximal primers specific for the extracellular domain (Fig.1 A). PAC1R products were then identified by Southern hybridization with an end-labeled oligonucleotide probe. RT-PCR analysis of RNA from 2-mm segments of seminiferous tubules (Fig. 1 B) revealed the presence of three isoforms. Sequencing of the cloned products identified the lower most band (arrow 1) to be identical to the published rat PAC1R sequence (GenBankTM accession number Z23279). The largest product (arrow 3) contained additional sequence between coding exons 4 and 5 and is likely a consequence of the inclusion of part of the 5′-region of the intron between exons 4 and 5 (intron slippage). The additional sequence includes two in-frame stop codons. The product corresponding to arrow 2 contained a novel region of 72 nucleotides inserted between coding exons 3 and 4 with no interruption of the translational reading frame. The predicted translation products are shown (Fig. 1 C). Exon 3a is an alternatively spliced “cassetted” exon and not due to intron slippage. The nested PCR approach was further utilized to isolate full-length receptor clones. Three full-length versions of the PACAP type 1 receptor were cloned (Fig. 1 C): 1) PAC1R, equivalent to GenBankTM accession number Z23279; 2) the PAC1R with the additional 24 amino acids; and 3) the PAC1R receptor “HOP” variant. The identities of all three clones were verified by sequencing. The PAC1R clone 1 was identical to the published sequence (18Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). In addition to the extra 72 bp of coding sequence (Fig.2 A), the longer clone 2 had one substitution (G to A) at nucleotide 798, compared with the published sequence. This G to A substitution did not alter the conceptual translation product and is most likely the result of misincorporation of a nucleotide during the PCR procedure. Clone 3 (Fig. 1 C) is an intron slippage splice variant resulting in a frameshift and the formation of a truncated protein. To determine whether the sequence coding for the insertion of an additional 24 amino acids into the PAC1R was due to the splicing in of a separate exon or was part of an existing exon or intron incorporated by a splice slippage event, the region between coding exons 3 and 4 was amplified from rat genomic DNA. Partial sequencing of this ∼2.5-kilobase pair fragment revealed that the inserted sequence was a separate exon (termed 3a), separated from the preceding exon 3 by 161 bp. (Fig. 2 B). The additional 24 amino acids encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 3a predict a markedly altered hydrophobicity profile of the extracellular domain by introducing a short stretch of hydrophilic amino acids, followed by a predominantly hydrophobic region (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, analysis of the inserted exon 3a using PROSITE software (27Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 28Bucher P. Bairoch A. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 53-61PubMed Google Scholar) identified a potential N-linked glycosylation site (NTSS), which may be a glycosylation-sensitive site for the regulation of the biologic functions of exon 3a. The tissue distribution of the novel receptor variant was assessed by RT-PCR of several rat tissues responsive to PACAP (Fig.3). A DNA product corresponding to PAC1R was amplified from cerebellum, hypothalamus, pituitary, pancreatic islets, seminiferous tubule, and the INS-1 cell line (Fig.3 A; 482-bp band in upper panel). A product corresponding in size to that expected for PAC1R(3a) is also strongly detected in seminiferous tubules. The identity of this product is confirmed by Southern hybridization to an oligonucleotide probe (DP1) complementary to the exon 3a sequence (lower panel). The strongest signal for the PAC1R(3a) occurs in the seminiferous tubule. Other tissues show only trace amounts of PAC1R(3a) PCR product. To determine which cell populations within the testis express PAC1R(3a), dissociated rat testis cells were fractionated by velocity sedimentation at unit gravity. Fractions were examined by RT-PCR for products specific for certain cell types, as well as PAC1R(3a) (Fig.3 B). A PCR product corresponding to PAC1R(3a) was detected in highest amounts in fractions enriched for Sertoli cells (located by the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor PCR signal) and round spermatids (PACAP PCR signal). The product is absent in spermatocytes (fractions 4 and 5), in which a pachytene spermatocyte marker, transcription factor SOX-17, is expressed. PCR products corresponding in size to PAC1R and PAC1R(3a) were also detected in cultures of adult rat Sertoli cells substantially purified as described under “Materials and Methods” (data now shown). However, as some germ cells remain associated with Sertoli cells in these cultures, and in STAPUT fractionations, the presence of the variant receptor on adult Sertoli cells cannot be verified. Binding studies were carried out in HEK293 cells stably transfected with recombinant plasmids expressing either the PAC1R or the PAC1R(3a). The receptors were compared for their relative binding of PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 by displacement of 125I-labeled PACAP-27 with unlabeled peptides (Fig.4). Whereas the PAC1R and PAC1R(3a) displayed equal affinity for PACAP-27 (Fig. 4 A), the PAC1R(3a) showed a significantly increased (6.1-fold) affinity for PACAP-38 over the PAC1R (Fig. 4 B). The amino-terminal truncated PACAP-(6–38) peptide, which lacks signaling activity and therefore acts as an antagonist of the PACAP receptor, displayed a 1.9-fold increase in binding affinity for PAC1R(3a) compared with the PAC1R (Fig. 4 C). The Km values of the different ligand/receptor combinations are summarized in TableI. In other experiments, the sequence-related peptides VIP, PHI (peptidehistidine isoleucine), and PRP did not displace125I-PACAP-27 from either the PAC1R- or PAC1R(3a)-expressing cell lines (data not shown). The efficiency of signaling through the cAMP pathway was assayed using a cAMP-responsive reporter gene. The specificity of this method was assessed by using specific inhibitors of protein kinase A (H89) and PLC (U73122). H89 dose-dependently inhibited the accumulation of luciferase activity in both PAC1R- and PAC1R(3a)-expressing cell lines treated with PACAP-27, and no inhibition was observed with U73122 (data not shown). The cAMP responsiveness of the PAC1R(3a)-expressing cell line was right-shifted with respect to the PAC1R-expressing line with both PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 (Fig. 4, A and B). This difference in ligand concentration coupling to cAMP formation between PAC1R and PAC1R(3a) was observed in a total of four independent experiments. Coupling to PLC-dependent signaling pathways was assessed by measuring the accumulation of inositol phosphates in response to PACAP-27 or PACAP-38 in the receptor-expressing stable cell lines. The PAC1R(3a)-expressing cell line clearly has a reduced sensitivity to both PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 compared with the PAC1R-expressing cell line (Fig. 4 B). This observation, seen in a total of three independent experiments, suggests that the 24 amino acids inserted in the alternatively spliced PAC1R(3a) also reduces coupling to the PLC-dependent signaling pathway. The EC50 values for cAMP and inositol phosphate generation are given in Table I. No difference was detected in the ability of PAC1R and PAC1R(3a) to elevate intracellular calcium in response to treatment of the HEK293 with PACAP38 or PACAP27. Alternative splicing of the PAC1R pre-mRNA has been described previously for the 5′-untranslated region, the third intracellular loop, and the extracellular ligand-binding domain (18Spengler D.

CKIα has been shown to play a role in cell cycle progression (20Gross S.D. Simerly C. Schatten G. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3083-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in membrane trafficking (21Gross S.D. Hoffman D.P. Fisette P.L. Bass P. Anderson R.A. J.

Recently, CKIs have been shown to be implicated in regulating the nucleocytoplasmic localization of some substrates (23Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J.-C. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 24Vielhaber E. Eide E. Rivers A. Gao Z.-H. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4888-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).Several substrates, including nuclear and cytosolic proteins and membrane receptors, have been reported to be phosphorylated at leastin vitro by a CKI activity (reviewed in Ref. 1Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 671-699Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar). CKI isoforms are thought to be constitutively active and second messenger-independent. However, it has been shown that CKIδ and CKIε are regulated by autophosphorylation (25Graves P.R. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32063-32070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). CKIα is also autophosphorylated, but whether this has an effect on its activity is not well defined. CKIα is negatively regulated by PtdIns(4,5)P2 (21Gross S.D. Hoffman D.P. Fisette P.L. Bass P. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, CKI isoforms have been reported to phosphorylate some of their substrates only if they were previously phosphorylated by another kinase two or three residues carboxyl-terminal to the CKI phosphorylation site. In this way, the effect of CKI is dependent on other kinases. CKIα is present in cells in different spliced forms (1Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 671-699Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 29Fu Z. Green C.L. Bennett G.S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 830-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) exhibiting different substrate specificities and differences in their protein-protein interactions.Although the yeast CKI isoforms have been well characterized, the functions of the mammalian CKI isoforms are much less known. Therefore, the identification of mammalian CKI substrates and CKI-binding proteins should help to clarify their cellular function(s). CKIα interacts with NF-AT4 (23Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J.-C. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), the paired helical filaments (30Kuret J.

Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19667-19675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the AP-3 complex (22Faundez V.V. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 2591-2604Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). CKIα also forms a complex with certain splicing factors but these interactions may be indirect (32Gross S.D. Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2647-2656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, we have shown that CKIα interacts with centaurin-α1. Centaurin-α1 is a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-binding protein containing two PH domains (33Hammonds-Odie L.P. Jackson T.R. Profit A.A. Blader I.J. Turck C.W. Prestwich G.D. Theibert A.B. J. Biol.

Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 37Donaldson J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Keans B.G. Theibert A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 489-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The yeast protein that shows the highest homology to centaurin-α1, Gcs1, also contains a zinc finger motif that confers its ARF-GAP activity (40Poon P.P. Wang X. Rotman M. Huber I. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10074-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Members of this family are involved in membrane trafficking and in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Our results suggest that CKIα plays a role in membrane trafficking and/or actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, thus confirming previous reports (21Gross S.D. Hoffman D.P. Fisette P.L. Bass P. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Faundez V.V. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 2591-2604Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn this report we have identified centaurin-α1 as a novel CKIα partner based on the following evidence: (a) they co-purified from brain after elution from four chromaaff5raphy steps; (b) centaurin-α1 associates in vitro with CKIα indicating that the binding is direct; (c) the binding is specific as centaurin-α1does not interact in vitro with 14-3-3 ζ under the same conditions; (d) they form a protein complex in COS-7 cells as shown in immunoprecipitation experiments; (e) centaurin-α1 interacts with residues 217–233 of CKIα using deletion mutants of CKIα; and (f) centaurin-α1 elutes from a peptide affinity chromaaff5raphy column containing residues 214–233 of CKIα.CKI isoforms are characterized by a conserved core kinase domain and by variable amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails. We report here that centaurin-α1 interacts with the kinase domain and not with the unique tails of CKIα. Moreover, a mutant of CKIδ deleted of its carboxyl-terminal domain binds to centaurin-α1 as well as does CKIδ, suggesting that the kinase domain of CKIδ represents the centaurin-binding site. In addition, the site of interaction within the kinase domain (residues 217–233) is present in a loop between two helices which has been proposed to represent an interaction domain for CKI targets (46Longenecker K.L. Roach P.J. Hurley T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 618-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The residues within that loop are well conserved among the CKI family. Indeed, we have shown that all mammalian CKI isoforms are able to associate with centaurin-α1 in vitro. This suggests that the same loop, present in all CKI isoforms, is responsible for the interaction with centaurin-α1.Centaurin-α1 and centaurin-α have been identified as PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-binding proteins (33Hammonds-Odie L.P. Jackson T.R. Profit A.A. Blader I.J. Turck C.W. Prestwich G.D. Theibert A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18859-18868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 34Stricker R.

Iwasaki S. Kaibuchi K. Kanaho Y. Terada Y. Kimura K. Nagata S. Fukui Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is mainly responsible for the synthesis of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 by phosphorylating PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the 3-OH position (47Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is involved in regulating various biological processes including membrane ruffling, membrane trafficking, and actin cytoskeleton regulation (48Martin T.F.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 49Corvera S. D'Arrigo A. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin.

It is interesting to note that CKIα has recently been shown to interact with the clathrin adaptor AP-3 (22Faundez V.V. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 2591-2604Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), another PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-binding protein (51Hao W. Tan Z. Prasad K. Reddy K.K. Chen L. Prestwich G.D. Falck J.R. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6393-6398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). PtdIns(4,5)P2 has been shown to inhibit CKIα activity in vitro (21Gross S.D. Hoffman D.P. Fisette P.L. Bass P. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the physiological relevance of the inhibition of CKIα by these two phospholipids remains to be demonstrated. Another link between CKI and the phosphoinositide pathway has been reported in S. pombe. The authors showed that a yeast CKI homologue, Cki1, phosphorylates and inhibits PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase (52Vancurova I. Choi J.H. Lin H. Kuter J. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1147-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Centaurin-α1 belongs to a newly identified family of ARF-GAP proteins (reviewed in Refs. 36Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 37Donaldson J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Keans B.G. Theibert A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 489-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Members of this family share a cysteine-rich GAP domain and contain several other domains such as PH domains, SH3 domains, and ankyrin repeats. These proteins are involved in vesicle trafficking and in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Therefore, our data support a role for CKIα in these biological events, in agreement with previous reports (21Gross S.D. Hoffman D.P. Fisette P.L. Bass P. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Faundez V.V. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 2591-2604Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, CKIα interacts with and phosphorylates the clathrin adaptor AP-3 (22Faundez V.V. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 10: 2591-2604Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which is involved in endocytosis. It is interesting to note that a genetic interaction between yeast CKI and AP-3 was identified previously (8Panek H.R. Stepp J.D. Engle H.M. Marks K.M. Tan P.K. Lemmon S.K. Robinson L.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4194-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Moreover, CKIα has been found to co-localize in neurones with synaptic vesicle markers and phosphorylates some vesicle synaptic associated proteins (21Gross S.D. Hoffman D.P. Fisette P.L. Bass P. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, centaurin-α1 has been shown to associate with presynaptic vesicular structures (53Kreutz M.R. Bockers T.M. Sabel B.A. Hulser E. Stricker R. Reiser G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2110-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An actin-associated protein kinase shown to be a member of the CKI family phosphorylates actin in vitro(54Karino A. Okano M. Hatomi M. Nakamura T. Ohtsuki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1472: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the kinase (37 kDa) suggests that it could be CKIα, and we have shown that recombinant CKIα indeed phosphorylates actin. 2T. Dubois, S. K. Maciver, and A. Aitken, unpublished data. In addition, the protein DAH (Discontinuous Actin Hexagon) that interacts with the actin cytoskeleton has been shown to be phosphorylated by CKIin vitro (55Zhang C.X. Rothwell W.F. Sullivan W. Hsieh T.-S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Members of the ARF-GAP family contain several domains for protein-protein interactions, and they have been shown to associate with a number of different proteins. This suggests that ARF-GAP proteins may act as scaffold proteins in addition to their function as GAP proteins. Whether other ARF-GAP proteins interact with CKI is not known. The ARF-GAP proteins Git1 and Git2 have been reported to regulate the internalization of some G-protein-coupled receptors (56Premont R.T. Claing G. Vitale N. Freeman J.L. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22373-22380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). CKIα has been shown to interact with and phosphorylate these G-protein-coupled receptors (31Budd D.C. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19667-19675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 59Tobin A.B. Totty N.F. Sterlin A.E. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20844-20849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, most of the identified ARF-GAP proteins are involved in the Pak signaling pathway (reviewed in Ref. 36Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, CKIγ2 has been found to interact with the adaptor molecule Nck (60Lussier G. Larose L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2688-2694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) in a complex with Pak1 (61Voisin L. Larose L. Meloche S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), thus raising the possibility that CKI may associate with other ARF-GAP proteins. Therefore, it would be important to investigate whether ARF-GAP proteins interact with CKI isoforms.Gcs1, the budding yeast homologue of centaurin-α1, also contains a cysteine-rich domain that is necessary for its ARF-GAP activity (40Poon P.P. Wang X. Rotman M. Huber I. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10074-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As yet, no ARF-GAP activity has been reported for centaurin-α1, but it is able of rescuing a ΔGcs1 strain mutant indicating that centaurin-α1 and Gcs1 may have similar function(s) (62Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Jackson T.R. Cullen P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Gcs1 has been shown to be necessary for the resumption of cell proliferation from stationary phase (63Ireland L.S. Johnston G.C. Drebot M.A. Dhillon N. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Singer R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3812-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and is involved in endocytosis (7Wang X. Hoekstra M.F. DeMaggio A.J. Dhillon N. Vancura A. Kuret J. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Gcs1 also plays a role in actin cytoskeleton regulation in vivo and binds to actin in vitro (64Blader I.J. Jamie M. Cope T.V. Jackson T.R. Profit A.A. Greenwood A.F. Drubin D.G. Prestwich G.D. Theibert A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As vesicle trafficking is closely associated to actin organization in yeast, Gcs1 may link vesicle trafficking and the actin cytoskeleton (64Blader I.J. Jamie M. Cope T.V. Jackson T.R. Profit A.A. Greenwood A.F. Drubin D.G. Prestwich G.D. Theibert A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Yeast CKIs (Yck1 and Yck2) were shown to suppress the Gcs1 blockage effects on cell proliferation and endocytosis (7Wang X. Hoekstra M.F. DeMaggio A.J. Dhillon N. Vancura A. Kuret J. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The membrane association of Yck2 was necessary for this effect (7Wang X. Hoekstra M.F. DeMaggio A.J. Dhillon N. Vancura A. Kuret J. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Yck1/2 is involved in cyaff8inesis, in bud development (5Robinson L.C. Menold M.M. Garret S. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2870-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Robinson L.C. Bradley C. Bryan J.D. Jerome A. Kweon Y. Panek H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1077-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton as yckts mutants fail to depolarize the actin cytoskeleton during mitosis (5Robinson L.C. Menold M.M. Garret S. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2870-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Another link between Gcs1 and CKI is the ankyrin repeat protein Akr1p. Gcs1 has been shown to interact with Akr1p in yeast two-hybrid experiments (65Kao L.R. Peterson J. Ji R. Bender L. Bender A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Akr1p and Yck1/2 regulate yeast endocytosis, and Akr1p regulates the plasma membrane localization of Yck1/2 (11Feng Y. Davies N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5350-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These authors proposed that the Yck1/2 membrane localization may involve other proteins such as Gcs1 (65Kao L.R. Peterson J. Ji R. Bender L. Bender A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Our data suggest that CKIα does not phosphorylate centaurin-α and centaurin-α1. In addition centaurin-α1 has no effect on CKI activity. Therefore, what is the functional relevance of the interaction between CKIα and these PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-binding proteins? As CKIα does not contain a lipid binding domain, it may associate with membranes through interaction with other proteins. Centaurin-α1 may represent one of these proteins, as has been proposed for its yeast counterpart (see above and Ref. 65Kao L.R. Peterson J. Ji R. Bender L. Bender A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CKIα may also represent a downstream target for centaurin-α1 as suggested by the results in budding yeast showing that CKIs suppress Gcs1 mutant phenotypes.In conclusion, we have shown an interaction between CKIα and centaurin-α1, a member of the ARF-GAP protein family that is involved in membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton regulation. Our present results are in agreement with data reported previously suggesting a role for CKI in membrane trafficking and/or regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Our findings are further supported by evidence of a genetic link between CKI and Gcs1 in budding yeast. The casein kinase I (CKI)1 family of serine/threonine kinases is ubiquitously expressed in a range of eukaryotes including yeast and humans as well as in plants (reviewed in Ref. 1Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 671-699Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Seven isoforms from distinct genes are expressed in mammals (CKI α, μ, γ1, γ2, γ3, δ, and ε), four inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (Hrr25, Yck1, Yck2, and Yck3), and five in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Cki1, Cki2, Cki3, Hhp1, and Hhp2). The CKI family is characterized by a conserved core kinase domain and variable amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails. Yeast CKI isoforms are involved in DNA repair (2Hoekstra M.F. Liskay R.M. Ou A.C.

https://openalex.org/W2042923118,"Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) is a divergent member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily. While it is synthesized in a pre-pro form, it is unique among superfamily members because it does not require its propeptide for correct folding or secretion of the mature peptide. To investigate factors that enable these propeptide independent events to occur, we constructed MIC-1/TGF-β1 chimeras, both with and without a propeptide. All chimeras without a propeptide secreted less efficiently compared with the corresponding constructs with propeptide. Folding and secretion were most affected after replacement of the predicted major α-helix in the mature protein, residues 56–68. Exchanging the human propeptide in this chimera with either the murine MIC-1 or TGF-β1 propeptide resulted in secretion of the unprocessed, monomeric chimera, suggesting a specific interaction between the human MIC-1 propeptide and mature peptide. Propeptide deletion mutants enabled identification of a region between residues 56 and 78, which is important for the interaction between the propeptide and the mature peptide. Cotransfection experiments demonstrated that the propeptide must be incis with the mature peptide for this phenomenon to occur. These results suggest a model for TGF-β superfamily protein folding.

Finally, a number of recent reports have demonstrated that the MIC-1 promoter region is a target for the p53 tumor suppressor gene product (9Li P.-X. Wong J. Ayed A. Duc N. Brade A.M. Arrowsmith C.

This last effect was a result of induction by MIC-1 of both G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast tumor cells. The MIC-1 protein is synthesized as a 308-amino acid polypeptide that encompasses a 29-amino acid signal peptide, a 167-amino acid propeptide, and a 112-amino acid mature region. The mature protein is secreted as a disulfide-linked homodimer of 112 amino acids which is released from the propeptide after intracellular cleavage at a typical RXXR furin-like cleavage site (1Bootcov M.R. Bauskin A.R. Valenzuela S.M. Moore A.G. Bansal M. He X.Y. Zhang H.P. Donnellan M. Mahler S. Pryor K. Walsh B.J. Nicholson R.C. Fairlie W.D. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Breit S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11514-11519Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Importantly, unlike all other TGF-β superfamily members studied to date, the MIC-1 mature peptide can be correctly folded and secreted without a propeptide (12Bauskin A.R. Zhang H.-P. Fairlie W.D. Russell P.K. Moore A.G. Brown D.A. Stanley K.K. Breit S.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2212-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,13Fairlie W.D. Zhang H.-P. Brown P.K. Russell P.K. Bauskin A.R. Breit S.N. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 254: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This unique property of MIC-1 makes it a particularly suitable molecule for the study of the factors that influence TGF-β superfamily protein folding. In the case of TGF-β1, activin A, Müllerian inhibitory substance, and bone morphogenetic protein-2, the propeptide region is known to be essential for the correct folding and secretion of the mature peptide (14Wilson C.A. di Clemente N.

For example, no TGF-β1 or activin A mature peptides were detected in the supernatants from cells transfected with constructs with an in-frame deletion of their propeptides, and analysis of the cell lysates indicated that the activin A had formed large intracellular disulfide-linked aggregates (16Gray A.M. Mason A.J. Science. 1990; 247: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To date, most of the studies that have examined the folding of TGF-β superfamily proteins have concentrated on the role of the propeptide. Sha et al. (17Sha X. Yang L. Gentry L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) used deletion and insertion mutagenesis to identify regions of the propeptide important for secretion of biologically active mature TGF-β1 and determined that amino acids between residues 50 and 80 interact with the mature peptide in the latent complex form of TGF-β1. Elimination of all glycosylation sites on the TGF-β1 and -β2 propeptide prevents secretion of any mature protein (18Brunner A.M. Lioubin M.N. Marquardt H. Malacko A.R. Wang W.C. Shapiro R.A.

Biol. 1992; 12: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mutation of the TGF-β1 propeptide cysteine residues results in the secretion of differently assembled and processed forms (20Brunner A.M. Marquardt H. Malacko A.R. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13660-13664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the Müllerian inhibitory substance propeptide helps to maintain the conformation of the Müllerian inhibitory substance mature peptide after secretion by preventing aggregation (14Wilson C.A. di Clemente N. Ehrenfels C. Pepinsky R.B. Josso N. Vigier B. Cate R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Only limited studies have focused on the mature peptide region, where the role of the cysteine residues has been examined for TGF-β1 and activin A, and all were found to be essential for the secretion of a fully bioactive mature protein (18Brunner A.M. Lioubin M.N. Marquardt H. Malacko A.R. Wang W.C. Shapiro R.A. Neubauer M. Cook J. Madisen L. Purchio A.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1691-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Mason A.J.

No detailed studies on MIC-1 folding have yet been published, although recently we reported that the propeptide has a role in the intracellular quality control of MIC-1 secretion by targeting monomeric precursor forms in the endoplasmic reticulum to the proteasome for degradation (12Bauskin A.R. Zhang H.-P. Fairlie W.D. Russell P.K. Moore A.G. Brown D.A. Stanley K.K. Breit S.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2212-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the current paper we have addressed a number of aspects of folding and secretion of MIC-1. In particular we have determined sequence regions of the mature peptide which enable it to fold and be secreted in the absence of the propeptide. We have also identified a region of the MIC-1 propeptide which can assist in protein folding/secretion. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were maintained as recommended by the American Type Culture Collection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. For collection of conditioned medium for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments, transfected cells were cultured in the absence of fetal bovine serum (see below). Anti-FLAG M2 antibody coupled to agarose used in immunoprecipitations was purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antisera to MIC-1 (PAb 233) was raised by immunization of sheep with purified recombinant human MIC-1 mature protein (13Fairlie W.D. Zhang H.-P. Brown P.K. Russell P.K. Bauskin A.R. Breit S.N. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 254: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The preparation of the base FLAG-tagged, full-length “long” construct (i.e.MIC-1 leader + propeptide + MIC-1 mature peptide; see Fig.1, constructs A1–A3) and “short” mature peptide only construct (FSH leader sequence + MIC-1 mature peptide; Fig. 1, constructs F1–F3) has been described previously (1Bootcov M.R. Bauskin A.R. Valenzuela S.M. Moore A.G. Bansal M. He X.Y. Zhang H.P. Donnellan M. Mahler S. Pryor K. Walsh B.J. Nicholson R.C. Fairlie W.D. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Breit S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11514-11519Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The FLAG epitope was engineered onto the amino terminus of the mature peptide of all constructs (i.e. inserted immediately after the furin-like cleavage sequence of propeptide region; see Fig. 1) to facilitate immumoprecipitation of the secreted proteins. The relevant constructs were cloned into the pOCUS-2 vector (Novagen) for the construction of the chimeras and other mutants, and the pIRES2-EGFP vector (CLONTECH) was used for transfection into CHO cells. Both the long and short constructs described previously were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and either Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) or Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) with the oligonucleotide primers 1 and 2 (for all primer sequences, see TableI), which added an XhoI andSacII + BglII sites onto their 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, for insertion into the pOCUS-2 vector (at theXhoI and BglII sites) or pIRES2-EGFP (at theXhoI and SacII sites). The various mutant/chimeric constructs were made using a whole plasmid polymerase chain reaction technique described previously (23Fairlie W.D. Russell P.K. Wu W.M. Moore A.G. Zhang H.-P. Brown P.K. Bauskin A.R. Breit S.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The primers for the site 1, 2, and 3 chimeras have also been described previously (23Fairlie W.D. Russell P.K. Wu W.M. Moore A.G. Zhang H.-P. Brown P.K. Bauskin A.R. Breit S.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For the propeptide deletion mutants (Fig. 1, constructs B–E), a single common reverse primer was used (primer 3) which corresponded to the 3′-end of the MIC-1 signal-peptide sequence, and the forward primers (primer 4, deletion 1–28; primer 5, deletion 1–78; primer 6, deletion 1–41; primer 7, deletion 1–55) were positioned so that the 5′-end started at the first base of the codon for the amino acid following the region of the propeptide to be deleted. The glycosylation mutant in which pro-Asn41 (asparagine residue 41 of the propeptide) was changed to a serine (Fig. 1, constructs I) mutant employed primers 8 and 9.Table IOligonucleotide sequences for primers used in polymerase chain reactions for the creation of the various constructsPrimer no.Primer sequence1AAT CTCGAGGATATCATGCCCGGGCAAGAACTCAG (F)2ACGAT AGATCTCCGCGGTCATATGCAGTGGCAGTC (R)3GGCGCCCCCATGCGGCAGCCACG (R)4AAACGCTACGAGGACCTGCTAACC (F)5GCCGCCCTTCCCGAGGGGCTC (F)6CAGAGCTGGGAAGATTCGAACACCG (F)7GCAGTCCGGATACTCACGCCAGAAGTGC (F)8GCCAGAGCTGGGAAGATTCGAACACCGAC (F)9TGGCCCGCAGCCTGGTTAGCAGGTCCTCG (R)10AATATA CTCGAGATGCCGCCCTCCGGGCTGCGGCTG (F)11ATAATA GAATTCTCGGCGGTGCCGGGAGCTTTGC (R)The (F) or (R) after each sequence indicates whether the primer used is a forward or reverse primer, respectively.

Plasmid DNA derived from individual colonies was sequenced bidirectionally to confirm whether the correct construct had been created. For all of the constructs involving changes to the mature peptide region, the BssHII/SacII fragment from the long, short, or both constructs in the pIRES2-EGFP vector was replaced with the same fragment from the mutated construct in the pOCUS-2 vector. For the propeptide deletion constructs, theXhoI/EcoRI fragment of the pIRES2-EGFP long construct was replaced with same fragment derived from the mutants in the pOCUS-2 vector. To create the constructs with the simian TGF-β1 propeptide fused to the MIC-1 mature (Fig. 1, construct H), the sim-TGF-β1 propeptide was amplified with primers 10 and 11, which added XhoI andEcoRI restriction enzyme sites to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The template for this construct was sim-TGF-β1 with the codons for Cys-223 and Cys-225 mutated to serine codons and was kindly provided by Ignacio Anegon (20Brunner A.M. Marquardt H. Malacko A.R. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13660-13664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The XhoI/EcoRI fragments from the long pIRES2-EGFP construct as well as the site 2 chimera cloned into the pIRES2-EGFP vector were then replaced with the digested, amplified sim-TGF-β1 propeptide. The murine MIC-1 propeptide was added to the wild type or site 2 chimeric human MIC-1 following replacement of the Xho/EcoRI fragment with the corresponding fragment of the long murine construct (Fig. 1, construct G). Transient transfections were performed in CHO-K1 cells grown in six-well plates to 60–80% confluence. Plasmid DNA (1 μg), purified using a Qiaprep Spin purification kit (Qiagen), was mixed with 9 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 15–30 min at room temperature and then added to cells in a total volume of 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in the same medium. Cells were washed with serum-free medium then maintained in 1 ml of the same medium for a further 48 h before collection for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. For the experiment to determine whether propeptide could act both incis and in trans, mutant and wild type constructs were transfected, as above, into a CHO-K1 cell line previously stably transfected with the human MIC-1 propeptide alone (12Bauskin A.R. Zhang H.-P. Fairlie W.D. Russell P.K. Moore A.G. Brown D.A. Stanley K.K. Breit S.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2212-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was monitored using a fluorescent microscope that could detect the enhanced green fluorescent protein, a product of the pIRES2-EGFP vector, and was routinely in the order of 60–80%. Comparison between supernatants was only made from wells in which the cells were transfected to approximately the same degree. Conditioned medium was collected, and the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed. To perform lysis, cells were scraped off the wells in the presence of 0.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and then incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysate was collected after centrifugation at 4 °C, then either immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG coupled to agarose, as described below, or 50 μl was analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE, performed under reducing conditions, and Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged proteins in the conditioned medium or cell lysates was performed by adding 10 μl of anti-FLAG antibody coupled to agarose and then incubating overnight at 4 °C. The bound proteins were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, or in the case of the lysates with the lysis buffer itself, and eluted by heating at 95 °C in SDS-PAGE (nonreducing or reducing) sample buffer. Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (1Bootcov M.R. Bauskin A.R. Valenzuela S.M. Moore A.G. Bansal M. He X.Y. Zhang H.P. Donnellan M. Mahler S. Pryor K. Walsh B.J.

Membranes were probed with either sheep anti-MIC-1 polyclonal antiserum 233 (diluted 1:7,000) or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody followed by either biotinylated anti-sheep (1:1,000) (Sigma) or anti-mouse antiserum (1:1,000) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. Blots were then visualized on film after treatment with strepavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The three-dimensional structures of the three mammalian TGF-β isoforms as well as bone morphogenetic proteins-2 and -7 and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor have all been solved (24Griffith D.L.

Comparison of these structures indicates that they are very similar in the overall fold of the subunits for each family member despite low amino acid sequence homology between family groups (26% between human TGF-β1 and human bone morphogenetic protein-7 and 12% between human TGF-β1 and human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor). This similarity suggested that it may be possible to construct chimeric molecules in which sequence regions of one family member are exchanged with the corresponding region of another family member. A similar approach has been used for the identification of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 receptor binding regions where chimeric molecules involving both isoforms proved to be useful (30Burmester J.K. Qian S.W. Ohlsen D. Phan S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Burmester J.K. Qian S.W. Roberts A.B. Huang A. Amatayakul-Chantler S.

We therefore made a series of constructs in which three distinct sequence regions of the mature protein of MIC-1 were replaced with the corresponding regions of TGF-β1. The three regions of MIC-1 selected were: residues 24–37 (site 1) which corresponds to part of the extended loop region also referred to as “finger 1” in TGF-β1; residues 56–68 (site 2), corresponding to the major α-helix (also called the “heel” region) in TGF-β1; and residues 90–98 (site 3), which encompasses a type II′ β-turn and corresponds to the tip of “finger 2” of TGF-β1 (for the structural location each region see Fig.2 a; for sequences, see Fig.2 b). Additional constructs were also made in which the propeptide region was either deleted or replaced with the murine MIC-1 or sim-TGF-β1 propeptide. To determine whether each of the sequence substitutions described above would be tolerated and result in the secretion of a correctly processed dimeric molecule, the three MIC-1/TGF-β1 chimeric constructs with associated MIC-1 propeptide (see Fig. 1, constructs A1–A3) were transfected into CHO-K1 cells. Supernatants were collected and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-coupled agarose and analyzed by Western blotting. Bands of the correct apparent molecular mass (30 kDa) for dimeric, FLAG-tagged MIC-1 were observed for each construct (Fig. 3, a–d,lanes 1), indicating that the mature protein was correctly assembled, processed, and secreted. Furthermore, the level of secretion of the chimeras was similar to that of the wild type mature peptide. No similar bands were observed in the immunoprecipitated supernatant from cells transfected with the vector only (Fig. 3 d, lane 3). Various additional higher molecular mass bands observed inlane 1 at ∼33, 40, and 50 kDa correspond to aberrantly or differentially processed forms of MIC-1 which have been characterized previously (12Bauskin A.R. Zhang H.-P. Fairlie W.D. Russell P.K. Moore A.G. Brown D.A. Stanley K.K. Breit S.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2212-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As indicated previously, MIC-1 is unique among the TGF-β superfamily members studied to date in that it can be secreted from a construct in which the propeptide is deleted. To identify sequence regions of the mature MIC-1 protein which enable it to fold correctly without association or interaction with its propeptide, the three chimeras were expressed using constructs in which the propeptide had been deleted (Fig. 1, constructs F1–F3). An FSH leader sequence was fused to these proteins to enable secretion. This adds three extra amino acids to each subunit resulting in slower migration of the expressed proteins on SDS-PAGE compared with those expressed from the full-length constructs. Bands corresponding to the molecular mass of dimeric MIC-1 were observed for both the wild type MIC-1 and the site 1 and site 3 replacements (Fig. 3, a, b, and d,lanes 2) following immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of the supernatants from CHO cells transfected with these constructs. This indicates that these proteins were correctly assembled and secreted despite the deletion of the propeptide. However, the level of secretion of the site 1 and site 3 chimeras was consistently less than the corresponding constructs with a propeptide. In the case of the site 2 replacement, no measurable protein was secreted from the expressed construct without propeptide (Fig. 3 c, lane 2), demonstrating that this protein cannot be folded and/or secreted without the presence of the propeptide. Analysis of the cell lysates for all truncated constructs demonstrated that the mutant proteins were synthesized at approximately the same level (Fig. 3, lower panel), confirming that the markedly lower level of protein observed in the supernatant for the site 2 chimera in the absence of its propeptide is caused by its inefficient folding/secretion. These combined results therefore suggest that the MIC-1 propeptide, although not essential, can assist in folding/secretion. Furthermore, it appears that the site 2 (α-helix) sequence is one region of MIC-1 which enables it to be secreted in the absence of the propeptide. The carbohydrate moieties on the propeptide of the TGF-β1 and -β2 propeptides are important for the secretion of biologically active TGF-β mature peptides. Glycosylation of the MIC-1 propeptide occurs at a singleN-linked glycosylation site at residue pro-Asn41(residue asparagine 41 of the propeptide) (12Bauskin A.R. Zhang H.-P. Fairlie W.D. Russell P.K. Moore A.G. Brown D.A. Stanley K.K. Breit S.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2212-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether the carbohydrate moiety played a role in MIC-1 folding and secretion and in particular to determine whether it was essential for secretion of the site 2 MIC-1/TGF-β chimera. To achieve this, pro-Asn41 of the propeptide was mutated to a serine residue on constructs with both the wild type and site 2 chimeric mature pep"

T3Rs can bind to DNA either as receptor homodimers or as heterodimers with RXRs. Once bound to DNA, nuclear hormone receptors regulate target gene expression by recruiting auxiliary proteins, denoted corepressors and coactivators. We report here that T3R homodimers assembled on DNA exhibit particularly strong interactions with the SMRT corepressor, whereas T3R·RXR heterodimers are inefficient at binding to SMRT. Mutants of T3R that exhibit enhanced repression properties, such as the v-Erb A oncoprotein or the T3Rβ-Δ432 mutant found in human resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome, display enhanced homodimerization properties and exhibit unusually strong interactions with the SMRT corepressor. Significantly, the topology of a DNA binding site can determine whether that site recruits primarily homodimers or heterodimers and therefore whether corepressor is efficiently or inefficiently recruited to the resulting receptor-DNA complex. We suggest that T3R homodimers, and not heterodimers, may be important mediators of transcriptional repression and that the nature of the DNA binding site, by selecting for receptor homodimers or heterodimers, can influence the ability of the receptor to recruit corepressor.

Given that most nuclear receptors are able to bind to DNA as protein dimers, a prototypic HRE is composed of two half-sites (43Forman B.M. Samuels H.H.

The sequence of the individual half-sites, their spacing, and their orientation contribute to the specificity of DNA recognition by the different nuclear receptors (45Glass C.K. J.

Imposed on this diversity of HREs is the ability of many nuclear receptors to bind to DNA not only as homodimers but also as heterodimers with other members of the nuclear receptor family. Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are particularly important heterodimer partners for many nuclear receptors, and T3R·RXR and RAR·RXR heterodimers can form with higher affinity and exhibit stronger transcriptional activation properties than do the corresponding homodimers (3Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M.

We report here that T3R homodimers assembled on DNA exhibit particularly strong interactions with the SMRT corepressor, whereas T3R·RXR heterodimers are inefficient at binding to corepressors. Mutants of T3R that exhibit enhanced repression properties, such as the v-Erb A oncoprotein or the T3Rβ-Δ432 mutant found in human resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) syndrome (8Sap J. Muñoz A. Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H. Vennström B. Nature. 1989; 340: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 53Yoh S.M. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 159: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), display enhanced homodimerization properties and exhibit unusually strong interactions with corepressor. Significantly, the orientation and spacing of the half-sites in a response element can influence whether a given response element recruits v-Erb A primarily as a homodimer or as a v-Erb A/RXR heterodimer and therefore whether corepressor is efficiently or inefficiently recruited to the v-Erb A-DNA complex. Transfection experiments further support the suggestion that transcriptional repression may be mediated primarily through the actions of receptor homodimers rather than heterodimers with RXR. In contrast to T3Rs, however, RARs efficiently recruit corepressor both as homodimers and as heterodimers with RXR, indicating that the nature of the receptor dimer may play a less decisive role in corepressor recruitment by RARs. Small, hydrophobic hormones, such as steroids, retinoids, and the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 thyronine, regulate many important aspects of metazoan differentiation, reproduction, and homeostasis.

Different nuclear receptors bind to different DNA sequences, denoted hormone response elements (HREs),1 and modulate the expression of adjacent target genes. In this fashion, different sets of target genes are regulated in response to different hormone ligands, leading to physiologically appropriate changes in target cell phenotype (1Apriletti J.W.

Nuclear receptors bind to DNA with each receptor molecule recognizing a conserved, 6–8-base DNA sequence referred to as a “half-site” (3Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6027) Google Scholar). Given that most nuclear receptors are able to bind to DNA as protein dimers, a prototypic HRE is composed of two half-sites (43Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. New Biol. 1990; 2: 587-594PubMed Google Scholar, 44Laudet V. Stehelin D. Curr. Biol. 1992; 2: 293-295Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The sequence of the individual half-sites, their spacing, and their orientation contribute to the specificity of DNA recognition by the different nuclear receptors (45Glass C.K. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 150: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 46Naar A.M. Boutin J.M. Lipkin S.M., Yu, V.C. Holloway J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Notably, however, a surprisingly diverse array of DNA sequences can serve as response elements for a given nuclear receptor. T3Rs, for example, are able to bind to HREs comprised of two half-sites oriented as a direct repeat with a 4-base spacer (DR-4), an inverted repeat with no spacer (INV-0), or a divergent repeat with a 6-base spacer (DIV-6) (46Naar A.M.

Imposed on this diversity of HREs is the ability of many nuclear receptors to bind to DNA not only as homodimers but also as heterodimers with other members of the nuclear receptor family. Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are particularly important heterodimer partners for many nuclear receptors, and T3R·RXR and RAR·RXR heterodimers can form with higher affinity and exhibit stronger transcriptional activation properties than do the corresponding homodimers (3Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M.

We wished to determine if the ability of nuclear receptors to recruit SMRT corepressor might differ for receptor homodimers versusheterodimers and if the nature of the DNA response element could influence, directly or indirectly, this receptor/corepressor interaction. We report here that T3R homodimers assembled on DNA exhibit particularly strong interactions with the SMRT corepressor, whereas T3R·RXR heterodimers are inefficient at binding to corepressors. Mutants of T3R that exhibit enhanced repression properties, such as the v-Erb A oncoprotein or the T3Rβ-Δ432 mutant found in human resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) syndrome (8Sap J. Muñoz A. Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H. Vennström B. Nature. 1989; 340: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 53Yoh S.M. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 159: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), display enhanced homodimerization properties and exhibit unusually strong interactions with corepressor. Significantly, the orientation and spacing of the half-sites in a response element can influence whether a given response element recruits v-Erb A primarily as a homodimer or as a v-Erb A/RXR heterodimer and therefore whether corepressor is efficiently or inefficiently recruited to the v-Erb A-DNA complex. Transfection experiments further support the suggestion that transcriptional repression may be mediated primarily through the actions of receptor homodimers rather than heterodimers with RXR. In contrast to T3Rs, however, RARs efficiently recruit corepressor both as homodimers and as heterodimers with RXR, indicating that the nature of the receptor dimer may play a less decisive role in corepressor recruitment by RARs.

There is a sequential addition of carbohydrates by glycosyltransferases that are distributed within the Golgi in the order in which the glycosylation occurs. The mechanism of glycosyltransferase retention is considered to involve their transmembrane domains and flanking regions, although we have shown that the cytoplasmic tail of α1,2-fucosyltransferase is important for its Golgi localization. Here we show that the removal of the α1,2-fucosyltransferase cytoplasmic tail altered its function of fucosylation and its localization site. When the tail was removed, the enzyme moved from the Golgi to the trans Golgi network, suggesting that the transmembrane is responsible for retention and that the cytoplasmic tail is responsible for localization. The cytoplasmic tail of α1,2-fucosyltransferase contains 8 amino acids (MWVPSRRH), and mutating these to alanine indicated a role for amino acids 3 to 7 in localization with a particular role of Ser5. Mutagenesis of Ser5 to amino acids containing an hydroxyl (Tyr and Thr) demonstrated that the hydroxyl at position 5 is important. Thus, the cytoplasmic tail, and especially a single amino acid, has a predominant role in the localization and thus the function of α1,2-fucosyltransferase.

Glycosylation of proteins and lipids occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus and is mediated by glycosyltransferases and glycosidases that are resident there. The enzymes are ordered so that carbohydrates can be sequentially added to and removed from proteins and lipids (1Dunphy W.G. Rothman J.E.

The mechanism for retention of the enzymes in the appropriate subcompartment and the domains of the enzymes that direct this localization are not clear. At present there are two proposed mechanisms for Golgi glycosyltransferase localization, kin recognition (4Nilsson T. Rabouille C. Hui N. Watson R. Warren G. J.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), where like gycosyltransferases form aggregates within the Golgi, and the lipid bilayer model, where the hydrophobic transmembrane domain retains the transferases in the Golgi (6Munro S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4695-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Neither the kin-recognition nor the lipid bilayer models fully explain the specific and functional localization of transferases to discrete sites within the Golgi; we now demonstrate that the cytoplasmic tail is a key element in the specific localization of α1,2-fucosyltransferase. Glycosyltransferases are type II integral membrane proteins, with the catalytic domain residing in the lumen of the Golgi (7Joziasse D.H. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and the N terminus in the cytoplasm (cytoplasmic tail).

For the FLAG-tagged mutants the PCR 5′ primers were as follows: FT-FLAG, 5′-GCGGATCCATGTGGGTCCCCAGCCGCCGCCACCTC; FTΔcyt, 5′-GCGGATCCATGCACCTCTGTCTGACCTTCCTGCTAGTCTGTG; and the 3′primer incorporating the FLAG epitope was 5′-CGTCTAGATCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCAGGCCCAGCCAACATCTGGAGTGGAGAC-3′. After the initiation methionine, FTΔcyt starts at His8of the FT amino acid sequence. The ftGT chimera was produced by polymerase chain reaction using the untagged pig α1,3-galactosyltransferase (18Sandrin M.S. Dabkowski P.L. Henning M.M. Mouhtouris E. McKenzie I.F. Xenotransplantation. 1994; 1: 81-88Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as template. The oligonucleotides were 5′-GCGGATCCATGTGGGTCCCCAGCCGCCGCCACGTGGTTCTGTCAATGCTGCTTGTC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGAGCGTCAGATGTTATTTCTAACCAAATTATAC-3′. All DNA was digested with BamHI and XbaI and ligated into pcDNA1. DNA was purified using Qiagen products and transfected into COS-7 cells using DEAE-dextran (20Vaughan H.A. Henning M.M. Purcell D.F. McKenzie I.F. Sandrin M.S. Immunogenetics. 1991; 33: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (CSL) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (CSL). COS-7 and Chinese hamster ovary cells transformed with large T antigen (21Heffernan M. Dennis J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were stained 48 h after transfection by incubation in antibody or lectin-diluted in phosphate-buffered saline/0.5% bovine serum albumin. For immunofluorescence microscopy counting was performed blind, and experiments were repeated at least three times; flow cytometry was performed at least three times busing a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur. For confocal microscopy, cells were passaged into chamber slides and cultured overnight prior to incubation for 4 h in cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) to inhibit protein synthesis, followed by a 15-min incubation in Brefeldin A (5 μg/ml). Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline followed by permeabilization and incubation in 0.5% saponin/phosphate-buffered saline containing diluted antibodies or lectins. The FLAG epitope was detected with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) followed by sheep anti-mouse Ig conjugated to FITC (Silenus). The cells were mounted in Prolong (Molecular Probes). Griffonia (Bandeiraea)simplicifolia lectin 1 (IB4) and Ulex europaeusagglutinin 1 (UEA1) (Sigma) were conjugated to FITC and used to stain for the products of GT, Galα(1,3)Gal, and FT (H substance), respectively. The assays for α1,2-fucosyltransferase and α1,3-galactosyltransferase were as described (16Sandrin M.S. Fodor W.L. Mouhtouris E. Osman N. Cohney S. Rollins S.A. Guilmette E.R. Setter E. Squinto S.P. McKenzie I.F. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1261-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The strategy used was to alter FT and perform the following two studies: (a) measure the function of FT by its effect on Galα(1,3)Gal expression on the cell surface and (b) examine cells by confocal microscopy to localize the enzymes. When GT (which attaches Galα(1,3)Gal linkages to NAcLac) and FT (which attaches α1,2-fucose to NAcLac creating H substance) are coexpressed, FT fucosylates NAcLac, in preference to GT, and this reduces the level of Galα(1,3)Gal (the product of GT) on the cell surface (16Sandrin M.S. Fodor W.L. Mouhtouris E. Osman N. Cohney S. Rollins S.A. Guilmette E.R. Setter E. Squinto S.P. McKenzie I.F. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1261-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To establish the functional assays, DNA constructs (Fig.1) were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells transformed with large T antigen that were analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2, A-J) for Galα(1,3)Gal staining (the enzymatic product of GT), using IB4-FITC (Fig. 2, A, C, E, G, andI) or for H substance (the enzymatic product of FT), using UEA1-FITC (Fig. 2, B, D, F,H, and J).Figure 2Determination of the ability ofFTΔcyt to compete withGTfor acceptor.Chinese hamster ovary cells transformed with large T antigen were cotransfected with DNA encoding the following: A andB, vector + GT; C and D, vector + FT;E and F, vector + FTΔcyt; G andH, GT + FT; and I and J, GT + FTΔcyt. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after surface staining for (i) the products of GT and Galα(1,3)Gal detected with IB4-FITC and (ii) the products of FT and H substance detected with UEA-1-FITC. The marker set for the population of positively stained cells is shown with the mfu.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Several important findings were apparent from these cotransfection experiments. Cells transfected with GT led to expression of Galα(1,3)Gal where the positive cells (shown by the marker on each panel) had 250 median fluorescence units (mfu; see Fig. 2A); these cells were nonreactive with UEA-1 lectin detecting H substance (Fig. 2B). Cells transfected with FT gave reciprocal results, negative for Galα(1,3)Gal (with IB4; see Fig. 2C) and positive for H substance (281 mfu with UEA1; see Fig.2D). When the two transferases were present simultaneously, the level of Galα(1,3)Gal was markedly reduced (63 mfu; see Fig.2G) compared with GT expressed alone (250 mfu; see Fig.2A); there was no decrease observed in the level of H substance (297 mfu; see Fig. 2H versus 281 mfu; see Fig. 2D). These findings were previously interpreted as being due to the localization of FT in an earlier compartment of the Golgi than GT (16Sandrin M.S. Fodor W.L. Mouhtouris E. Osman N. Cohney S. Rollins S.A. Guilmette E.R. Setter E. Squinto S.P. McKenzie I.F. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1261-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 17Osman N. McKenzie I.F.C. Mouhtouris E. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33105-33109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus the system was in place to examine alterations in the localization of the FT after removing the cytoplasmic tail. When the cytoplasmic tail was removed from FT (FTΔcyt) there was reduced but not absent expression of H (158 mfu; see Fig.2F) compared with full-length FT (281 mfu; see Fig.2D) and no expression of Galα(1,3)Gal (Fig.2E); this was not because of different levels of the transferases expressed, which were similar as shown by Western blot (data not shown). However, there was appreciable surface staining for H substance indicating that FTΔcyt was functional. Clearly the lack of the FT cytoplasmic tail was affecting FT function and perhaps its localization. This was confirmed in coexpression studies with GT, as FTΔcyt was no longer able to decrease Galα(1,3)Gal expression (173 mfu; see Fig. 2I) to the same extent as full-length FT (63 mfu; see Fig. 2G). Therefore FTΔcyt is present (as H is present), but as it no longer affects Galα(1,3)Gal expression, it is unlikely to be acting on the acceptor before GT, suggesting it has moved elsewhere. Thus the two enzymes, FT and GT, no longer have the same relationship, and FTΔcyt is no longer acting on the acceptor prior to GT. Indeed, GT appears to act before FTΔcyt, as the amount of H substance on the surface of the cells when GT and FTΔcyt were coexpressed (92 mfu; see Fig. 2J) was reduced compared with FTΔcyt alone (158 mfu; see Fig. 2F) showing that GT is now acting on the acceptor before FT. What has happened to the FT after removal of the tail? It is certainly present in the Golgi (see also below) as it is able to fucosylate proteins (UEA1-positive staining). We suspect it has moved to a post-Golgi compartment as the level of UEA1 staining is less than when the tail is present and GT, which is in the trans Golgi, is able to act on the acceptor before the FTΔcyt. It was therefore important to directly examine the localization of FT after removal of the tail (FTΔcyt). Fluorescent microscopy was used on cycloheximide-treated cells, which were subsequently stained for the transferases. The appearance of the Golgi and TGN can be distinguished using Brefeldin A treatment (22Reaves B. Banting G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). When cells are stained for Golgi prior to Brefeldin A treatment, they have a juxtanuclear staining pattern, which is lost after Brefeldin A treatment, to become diffuse cytoplasmic staining indicative of endoplasmic reticulum (22Reaves B. Banting G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, the TGN, which also has a juxtanuclear staining pattern without Brefeldin A, collapses around the microtubule organizing center with Brefeldin A and appears as a bright area of staining, similar to that observed for the microtubule organizing center (22Reaves B. Banting G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). When FT-FLAG was examined, the juxtanuclear staining pattern (suggesting either Golgi or TGN localization) was observed without Brefeldin A treatment (Fig.3A) and was altered to a diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern after Brefeldin A treatment (Fig.3B), showing that FT was present in the Golgi, a finding in agreement with others (15Opat A.S. Houghton F. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11836-11845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, when the FT tail was removed, FTΔcyt staining appeared as juxtanuclear (Fig. 3C), suggesting either Golgi or TGN localization, but after Brefeldin A treatment the staining pattern was similar to that of the TGN (Fig.3D). It is likely that FTΔcyt is in the TGN, because Brefeldin A causes the TGN to collapse around the microtubule organizing center (22Reaves B. Banting G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and in our study this is the appearance observed in the cells. No cell surface staining for the FLAG tag was observed in either FT- or FTΔcyt-transfected cells (data not shown). Thus after removing the FT tail, FT has moved from the Golgi to the TGN. The microscopic and functional studies show that the cytoplasmic tail is responsible for the specific localization of FT in the Golgi, and after its removal, the enzyme is found in the TGN. Having shown the importance of the FT cytoplasmic tail, we sought to determine which of the 8 amino acids (MWVPSRRH) in the cytoplasmic tail sequence of FT are important for its localization. Using the same functional readout each amino acid of the cytoplasmic tail was mutated and was examined for function. Thus, it would be expected that mutation of an amino acid in the FT tail, which is important for localization, would result in a reduced ability of FT to compete for acceptor with GT and result in a subsequent increase in the level of Galα(1,3)Gal. Each amino acid of the cytoplasmic tail was substituted by Ala to produce constructs FTtrp2ala, FTval3ala, FTpro4ala, FTser5ala, FTarg6ala, FTarg7ala, and FThis8ala. These constructs, full-length FT, or vector were cotransfected with GT into COS-7 cells, and the number of cells showing surface staining for IB4-FITC or for UEA-1-FITC was counted (Fig.4A). In cells transfected with FT or each of the FT mutants, 60% of cells were stained with UEA-1, showing that FT was present and functional. However, differences in the ability of the mutants to inhibit GT activity (as measured by cell surface IB4 staining) were found. Using GT alone, 50% of cells were positive for Galα(1,3)Gal, and this was reduced to 20% by coexpression of FT. The FTval3ala and FThis8ala mutants also inhibited Galα(1,3)Gal expression to 20%, i.e. these mutations had no effect on FT function and therefore localization and were unlikely to be involved in the localization of the enzyme. However, transfection of the FTtrp2ala, FTpro4ala, FTarg6ala, and FTarg7ala mutants with GT resulted in 40% of cells expressing Galα(1,3)Gal, indicating some alteration of FT localization. However, the Ser5 to Ala mutation removed the inhibitory effect of FT on GT as staining for Galα(1,3)Gal was on 50% of cells, and therefore there was no competition between the enzymes. Thus of the 8 amino acids, positions 4–7 are involved in localization of the enzyme. Ser5 is the most important amino acid; for position 3, a Val to Ala substitution is not a major structural change and could be involved in FT localization. To confirm that these differences were not because of changes in the enzymatic activity caused by mutation to the cytoplasmic tail, enzyme assays were performed. We have previously shown that changes in the levels of Galα1,3Gal and H substance on the cell surface were not because of changes in enzymatic activity (16Sandrin M.S. Fodor W.L. Mouhtouris E. Osman N. Cohney S. Rollins S.A. Guilmette E.R. Setter E. Squinto S.P. McKenzie I.F. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1261-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and that chimeric glycosyltransferases did not exhibit altered kinetics of enzyme function after switching of cytoplasmic tails between GT and FT (17Osman N. McKenzie I.F.C. Mouhtouris E. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33105-33109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However the issue of expression level of the FT mutants in the current experiments needed to be addressed. Cells were transfected as described for Fig. 4A, and lysates were assayed (Table I). There were no significant differences in the enzymatic rates between any of the FTs or the rate of GT (this was expected as the same amount of GT encoding DNA was transfected into each dish of cells). In particular, the S5A mutant had an enzyme rate of 1216.4 ± 206.7 pmol/hr/mg compared with that of FT, which was 1212.7 ± 206.1 pmol/hr/mg. Thus, the increase in Galα1,3Gal is not because of a decrease in the level of enzyme activity of the FT mutant.Table IEnzymatic rates of α1,2 fucosyltransferase in COS cell lysatesDNA transfectedpmol/hr/mgGT + FT1212.7 ± 206.1GT + Trp2 → Ala1805.3 ± 306.9GT + Val3 → Ala1718.7 ± 292.1GT + Pro4 → Ala1347.6 ± 229.0GT + Ser5 → Ala1216.4 ± 206.7GT + Arg6 → Ala1225.6 ± 208.3GT + Arg7 → Ala1644.4 ± 279.5GT + His8 → Ala1343.1 ± 228.3Cells were cotransfected with GT and wild-type or mutant FTs.

Open table in a new tab Cells were cotransfected with GT and wild-type or mutant FTs. Enzymatic rate is the mean ± S.D. of two independent experiments. The mean enzymatic rate for GT was 5.972 ± 1.166 pmol/hr/mg. The mutations in the cytoplasmic tail could lead to subtle shifts in FT localization. However, the assay described above (Fig. 4A) could not detect subtle differences as the number of cells expressing H substance was similar for all the mutants (Fig. 4A). To investigate possible subtle changes a new system was developed that is vulnerable to minor alterations in FT function. A construct was produced, ftGT, which encodes the 8 amino acid cytoplasmic tail of FT, but not the transmembrane and luminal domains of GT. Based on earlier work using the human FT cytoplasmic tail (17Osman N. McKenzie I.F.C. Mouhtouris E. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33105-33109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), ftGT would be positioned in the same subcompartment as FT and would compete for acceptor equally as both transferases have the same cytoplasmic tail. Using coexpression of ftGT and the FT mutants, any physical shift of FT mutants from the functional site in the Golgi would reduce their ability to compete for acceptor with ftGT and would therefore result in a loss of UEA-1 staining. ftGT was cotransfected with the Ala mutant FTs, wild-type FT, or vector alone, and cell surface staining for IB4 and UEA-1 was determined (Fig. 4B). FT did not inhibit the level of Galα(1,3)Gal after cotransfection with ftGT (60% of cells were positive), but rather both enzymes were able to function equally as they are probably located in the same subcompartment. Similarly, none of the mutants altered the level of cell surface H substance (60% of cells) except for FTser5ala, which reduced the level of cell surface staining from 60 to 30%. This indicates that FTser5ala has not been retained in the appropriate site within the Golgi but moved to a more distal compartment. By contrast, the ftGT is retained in the original FT subcompartment and adds Galα(1,3)Gal to NAcLac (high IB4 levels), and therefore there is less acceptor remaining for the FTser5ala that has shifted to a later subcompartment (reduced UEA-1 levels). As mutations of the other amino acids did not affect UEA-1 staining, it is clear that Ser5 is the most crucial amino acid for functional localization in COS-7 cells. The S5A mutation had a crucial effect on FT function although Ser and Ala differ by an hydroxyl group. To determine whether this hydroxyl group was the essential element in FT localization, Thr and Tyr (which also contain an hydroxyl group) were also substituted at position 5. FT and FTser5tyr and FTser5thr were cotransfected with GT, and the surface expression of Galα(1,3)Gal and H substance on COS-7 cells was determined (Fig.5). When FT was transfected, 60% of cells were stained with UEA-1 (Fig. 5A), and when GT was transfected 60% of cells were stained with IB4 (Fig. 5B). When FT and GT were coexpressed the level of UEA-1 staining remained at 60% (Fig. 5C), and the level of IB4 staining was reduced to 20% (Fig. 5D). As shown above, FTser5ala was cotransfected with GT, and the level of staining for both UEA-1 (Fig. 5E) and IB4 (Fig. 5F) was 60%, showing again that the mutant lacking the hydroxyl group could no longer compete with GT. However, coexpression of FTser5tyr or FTser5thr (both containing an hydroxyl group) with GT gave high levels of staining (60% of cells) with UEA-1 (Fig. 5, G and I, respectively) but not IB4 (Fig.5, H and J, respectively, 20% of cells) showing that an hydroxyl group at position 5 is important for the ability of FT to compete with GT. This was confirmed using FTser5phe and GT in cotransfections that gave similar IB4 and UEA-1 staining patterns to FTser5ala and GT (data not shown), demonstrating that the hydroxyl group rather than the ring structure of Tyr is important for FT localization. The addition of carbohydrate moieties to proteins and lipids occurs in a specific order, however the current models of resident Golgi protein localization do not adequately describe the mechanism of retention and localization of the glycosyltransferases that perform the glycosylation. Here we analyzed the involvement of the cytoplasmic tail of FT in localization in the Golgi. When FT and GT are coexpressed, FT first contacts the NAcLac acceptor and utilizes it prior to GT, leaving little acceptor for GT, which results in a reduction in Galα(1,3)Gal on the cell surface (16Sandrin M.S. Fodor W.L. Mouhtouris E. Osman N. Cohney S. Rollins S.A. Guilmette E.R. Setter E. Squinto S.P. McKenzie I.F. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1261-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 17Osman N. McKenzie I.F.C. Mouhtouris E. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33105-33109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Removal of the cytoplasmic tail of FT reversed the ability of FT to compete with GT, and Galα(1,3)Gal expression was restored (Fig.2). In addition, in the absence of the tail, GT utilized NAcLac preferentially, which reduced the expression of H substance on the cell surface (Fig. 2). Thus the cytoplasmic tail of FT is necessary for the localization of the enzyme in the Golgi so that it can perform its function with respect to competition with GT (17Osman N. McKenzie I.F.C. Mouhtouris E. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33105-33109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Having shown that the FT tail was important for function, we directly demonstrated that after removal of the cytoplasmic tail, the intracellular distribution of FT was altered in COS-7 cells. When examined by confocal microscopy, FT was localized to the Golgi (Fig. 3), as also shown by others (15Opat A.S. Houghton F. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11836-11845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, FT without a cytoplasmic tail (FTΔcyt) had a different distribution and had moved to the TGN. Removal of the cytoplasmic tail relocated FT from the Golgi to the TGN, and therefore the tail must be important in the subcellular localization of FT. Analysis of the 8-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of FT showed that amino acids 3–7 were involved in the localization (Fig. 4), and the serine at position 5 appeared to be the most critical. Furthermore, molecular replacement of Ser5 with threonine or tyrosine showed that the hydroxyl residue is important for the correct localization and function (Fig.5), whereas amino acids having the same side chains but lacking hydroxyl groups (Ala and Phe) did not correctly localize. Thus, the functional localization of FT involves the sequence in the cytoplasmic tail, especially the hydroxyl at position 5. It has been suggested that the lack of consensus sequences in the glycosyltransferases (except for a common peptide stretch that has not been assigned a function (23Bendiak B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 879-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar)) precludes the possibility of a specific retention signal in the polypeptide sequence of the enzymes. However, as presented here, removing the cytoplasmic tail of FT was sufficient to alter the position of FT (Fig. 3) presumably by affecting molecular interactions in the cytoplasm that localize it to a subcompartment of the Golgi. In these interactions, the hydroxyl group of Ser5 is important presumably by either formation of a hydrogen bond or phosphorylation. These findings of the importance of the cytoplasmic tail appear to be different from other theories in terms of the localizing domain of the enzyme but are compatible with current models of Golgi localization. The kin-recognition model is based on the aggregation of homo- and heterodimers into large complexes because of the hydrophobic transmembrane domain of trans Golgi enzymes (9Nilsson T. Lucocq J.M. Mackay D. Warren G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3567-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) or to the luminal domain of the medial Golgi enzymes mannosidase II andN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (4Nilsson T. Rabouille C. Hui N. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1975-1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Munro S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, although aggregation may contribute to retention, it is not clear how this aggregation could contribute to Golgi localization to a specific site. Our data are consistent with the kin-recognition model, as aggregation may be a prerequisite for the interaction of the FT cytoplasmic tail with some localizing agent on the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi such as glycosyltransferase receptors or with a Golgi matrix (25Slusarewicz P. Nilsson T. Hui N. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Nonreducing SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that FT is present as dimeric and larger molecular weight forms, possibly tetrameric (data not shown); others have found it as a dimer (15Opat A.S. Houghton F. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11836-11845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that multiple cytoplasmic tails brought close together by dimer formation may be important for localization. The second, lipid bilayer model (6Munro S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4695-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) is reliant upon the general property of hydrophobicity and length of the transmembrane domains rather than upon specific sequences in the transmembrane domain for retention within the Golgi; e.g. the shorter 17-amino acid transmembrane of sialyltranferase would not be able to span the membranes of post-Golgi and TGN compartments (6Munro S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4695-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). By removing the cytoplasmic tail of FT and leaving the transmembrane intact, we have shown that FT moves to the TGN, which is not the Golgi subcompartment that normally allows preferential utilization of NAcLac. This is consistent with the lipid bilayer model, as the transmembrane domain may retain the enzyme and play a role as an anchor, without which the transferase would be secreted. As we have not observed the “tailless” version of FT in any vesicular structures or on the cell surface, we presume it is the length and hydrophobicity of the transmembrane domain of FT that leads to its retention in the TGN. Thus the characteristics of the transmembrane domain are such that FT cannot be transported beyond the TGN, whereas the tail acts to keep it in a specific site in the Golgi. Thus, it is likely that a number of different factors dictate the precise localization of glycosyltransferases. Aggregation of the enzymes and their transmembrane domains may be involved in general Golgi retention, whereas retention sequences in glycosyltransferases may allow localization in specific functional subcompartments of the Golgi. The concept of a second glycosyltransferase signal for specific functional localization has also recently been suggested by others (26Grabenhorst E. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36107-36116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) who carefully analyzed the biosynthetic products of glycosyltransferases in vivo so that changes in their localization leading to changes in product could be monitored. The cytoplasmic tail is part of the general flanking sequence of the transmembrane domain along with the stem region in the luminal domain, which has been considered important for localization of Type II membrane proteins (9Nilsson T. Lucocq J.M. Mackay D. Warren G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3567-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 10Andersson A.M. Pettersson R.F. J.

This study shows that the role of the cytoplasmic tail of FT in Golgi localization is far more substantial than previously thought and that there are only a few amino acids involved in this phenomenon. The nature of the molecular interaction of the FT tail with the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi remains to be determined, especially in light of recent findings of the importance of the cytoplasmic portions of giantin (27Misumi Y. Sohda M. Tashiro A. Sato H. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6867-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in Golgi localization. We thank Dr. S.

https://openalex.org/W1565299101,"Adaptive epigenetic changes and toxicity often accompany constitutive expression of a transgene or knockout of an endogenous gene in mice. These considerations potentially limit the usefulness of transgenic technology in studying the in vivofunctions of a gene. Using conditional gene expression technology, it is possible to override such restrictions to achieve temporal and tissue-specific manipulation of gene expression in vivo. Based on the tetracycline regulatory system, we established a binary transgenic model in which the conditional expression of two transgenes, SV40 T antigen (TAg) and lacZ, can be tightly regulated in the liver by administration of tetracycline. The mouse albumin or mouse major urinary protein promoter was used to achieve liver-specific expression of the tetracycline-responsive transcriptional activator (tTA) in one set of transgenic mice. These mice were crossed with transgenic mice carrying either TAg orlacZ under the control of the tTA-regulated promoter. Analyses of mice transgenic for both tTA and TAg (or lacZ) revealed that the liver-specific expression of the transgenes could be suppressed to undetectable levels and regulated in a reversible fashion by tetracycline administration and withdrawal. Mice with tTA and TAg transgenes developed hepatocellular adenomas and hyperplasia that could be prevented by continuous tetracycline administration. Our report demonstrates the value of this binary transgenic model in studying the physiological functions of any potential genes of interest in a liver-specific manner. Adaptive epigenetic changes and toxicity often accompany constitutive expression of a transgene or knockout of an endogenous gene in mice. These considerations potentially limit the usefulness of transgenic technology in studying the in vivofunctions of a gene. Using conditional gene expression technology, it is possible to override such restrictions to achieve temporal and tissue-specific manipulation of gene expression in vivo. Based on the tetracycline regulatory system, we established a binary transgenic model in which the conditional expression of two transgenes, SV40 T antigen (TAg) and lacZ, can be tightly regulated in the liver by administration of tetracycline. The mouse albumin or mouse major urinary protein promoter was used to achieve liver-specific expression of the tetracycline-responsive transcriptional activator (tTA) in one set of transgenic mice. These mice were crossed with transgenic mice carrying either TAg orlacZ under the control of the tTA-regulated promoter. Analyses of mice transgenic for both tTA and TAg (or lacZ) revealed that the liver-specific expression of the transgenes could be suppressed to undetectable levels and regulated in a reversible fashion by tetracycline administration and withdrawal. Mice with tTA and TAg transgenes developed hepatocellular adenomas and hyperplasia that could be prevented by continuous tetracycline administration. Our report demonstrates the value of this binary transgenic model in studying the physiological functions of any potential genes of interest in a liver-specific manner. Transgenic mouse models have been used widely to study gene expression under in vivo physiological conditions. With tissue-specific promoters, it is possible to target gene expression exclusively in a specific tissue such as liver. However, constitutive expression of a transgene, especially if it deleteriously affects the tissues to which it is targeted, often results in prenatal or postnatal death or causes a variety of compensatory changes (1Kranias E.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol... 2000; 62: 965-969Google Scholar) in the overall gene expression pattern of the tissue. These changes could result in unexpected phenotypes that may not reflect the true biological functions of the transgene (2Sigmund C.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol... 2000; 20: 1425-1429Google Scholar, 3Jamieson B.D. Zack J.A. AIDS.. 1999; 13: S5-S11Google Scholar, 4Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science.. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Google Scholar, 5Hennighausen L. Wall R.J. Tillmann U. Li M. Furth P.A. J. Cell. Biochem... 1995; 59: 463-472Google Scholar). In certain situations, the transgene is silenced by epigenetic events such as methylation because of its adverse effects on the cells (2Sigmund C.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol... 2000; 20: 1425-1429Google Scholar, 6Sutherland H.G. Kearns M. Morgan H.D. Headley A.P. Morris C. Martin D.I. Whitelaw E. Mamm. Genome.. 2000; 11: 347-355Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transgene behaves as a self-antigen, inducing negative selection of reactive T cells in the thymus and causing the animals to become immunologically tolerant to the transgene. Therefore, the immunologic response to the transgene cannot be easily studied without special manipulation. This aspect is particularly relevant in models of autoimmune or viral disease. To circumvent these problems, it is necessary to develop a system by which the expression of a transgene can be induced at desired time points and otherwise be kept completely silent for an extended period of time. Such a model may also allow a viral or self-antigen to escape the thymic selection process so the immunologic response can be studied. The use of inducible promoters, such as heat shock, metallothionein, and murine mammary tumor virus promoters, that can be regulated by temperature, zinc, or dexamethasone is frequently associated with a high basal level of expression, a less than impressive induction of the transgene, a relative lack of specificity, and a possible toxicity of the induction method (3Jamieson B.D. Zack J.A. AIDS.. 1999; 13: S5-S11Google Scholar, 4Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science.. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Google Scholar, 7Agha-Mohammadi S. Lotze M.T. J. Clin. Invest... 2000; 105: 1177-1183Google Scholar). Conditional gene expression in vivo has been achieved using a variety of model systems. One of them takes advantage of thecre-lox recombination system by which a transgene can be activated and an endogenous gene deleted in a tissue-specific and time-dependent manner (8Sauer B. Methods.. 1998; 14: 381-392Google Scholar). However, this system requires the exogenous delivery of the cre gene (usually by an adeno- or retrovirus), and the induction is irreversible. Recently several drug- or ligand-inducible systems have been developed in vitro and, to some extent, in vivo (7Agha-Mohammadi S. Lotze M.T. J. Clin. Invest... 2000; 105: 1177-1183Google Scholar). These systems involve the use of a chimeric transcriptional activator that reversibly activates a target gene in response to the administration of the inducing agent. One of the systems that uses the intrinsic properties of the Escherichia coli tetracycline resistance operon has been applied widely to the generation of cell lines with tightly regulated gene expression in response to tetracycline (4Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science.. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Google Scholar). This system has also been applied to the transgenic models of lymphoid and salivary development (5Hennighausen L. Wall R.J. Tillmann U. Li M. Furth P.A. J. Cell. Biochem... 1995; 59: 463-472Google Scholar), but no such model has been reported for liver-specific expression. In this study, we developed a binary transgenic mouse model that permits the tight control of transgene expression in a temporal and liver-specific fashion by tetracycline (the tetracycline-repressed regulatable system). We evaluated the efficiency of this system in transgenic mouse strains carrying one of two reporter genes, one coding for SV40 T antigen (TAg)1 and the other for β-galactosidase (lacZ), and the tetracycline-responsive transcriptional activator (tTA) under the control of liver-specific promoter of mouse albumin (Alb) (9Sandgren E.P. Quaife C.J. Pinkert C.A. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Oncogene.. 1989; 4: 715-724Google Scholar, 10Shiota G. Rhoads D.B. Wang T.C. Nakamura T. Schmidt E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1992; 89: 373-377Google Scholar) or mouse major urinary protein (MUP) (11Held W.A. Mullins J.J. Kuhn N.J. Gallagher J.F. Gu G.D. Gross K.W. EMBO J... 1989; 8: 183-191Google Scholar, 12Derman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1981; 78: 5425-5429Google Scholar). tTA, in the absence of tetracycline, activates the reporter genes through binding to the reporter promoter sequence. The transgenes containing tTA under the control of the mouse albumin (Alb-tTA) or mouse major urinary protein (MUP-tTA) promoter were constructed (see Fig. 1 A). For construction of the Alb-tTA transgene, theEcoRI-BamHI fragment containing the tTA sequence from pUHD15.1 (22Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1992; 89: 5547-5551Google Scholar) was cloned into the EcoRI andBamHI sites of the pBSIIKS+ vector (Stratagene). The tTA fragment released by digestion of the resulting plasmid withNotI and XhoI was inserted into the pGEMAlbSVtpA vector (33Kawamura T. Furusaka A. Koziel M. Chung R.T. Wang T.C. Schmidt E.V. Liang T.J. Hepatology.. 1997; 25: 1014-1021Google Scholar). The resulting construct was digested with NheI and NsiI sites to generate the Alb-tTA transgene (∼4.5 kilobase pairs). The MUP-tTA transgenic construct was generated the following way. The PstI-KpnI fragment containing the MUP promoter from MUPII (11Held W.A. Mullins J.J. Kuhn N.J. Gallagher J.F. Gu G.D. Gross K.W. EMBO J... 1989; 8: 183-191Google Scholar) was inserted into the NsiI and KpnI sites of pSVSPORT1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), replacing the SV40 promoter. The EcoRI-HpaI fragment containing tTA and SV40tIVSpA from pUHD15.1 was inserted into the SalI (treated with Klenow for blunt end) andEcoRI sites of the previous construct. The resulting plasmid was then digested with ClaI and MluI to generate the MUP-tTA transgenic fragment (∼4.0 kilobase pairs). These transgenes were introduced into fertilized eggs of FVB/n mice using standard transgenic techniques (13Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Mice transgenic for SV40 T antigen (tetO-TAg; from Shimon Efrat, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY) (14Efrat S. Fusco-DeMane D. Lemberg H. al Emran O. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 3576-3580Google Scholar) or β-galactosidase (lacZ; from the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) (15Furth P.A. St. Onge L. Boger H. Gruss P. Gossen M. Kistner A. Bujard H. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 9302-9306Google Scholar) linked to the cytomegalovirus minimal promoter fused to the tTA-binding sequences (tetO) have been described previously. Genomic DNA isolated from tail clips of the offspring was used for genotyping. Genotyping of the Alb-tTA and MUP-tTA transgenic mice was performed using standard Southern blotting, and genotyping of the TAg mice was performed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with TAg-specific primers (sense, 5′-GGA ATA GTC ACC ATG AAT GAG TAC AG-3′; and antisense, 5′-GGA CAA ACC ACA ACT AGA ATG CAG TG-3′). Slow-release tetracycline pellets (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) were implanted subcutaneously in the shoulder regions of mice using a trochar as described by the manufacturer. These pellets release 0.7 mg of tetracycline hydrochloride/day for 21 days. As negative controls, placebo tablets obtained from the same manufacturer were similarly implanted. Expression of the transgene was measured on day 20. A group of mice were killed and analyzed for their transgene expression on day 28 (7 days after the dissolution of the tetracycline pellets) to evaluate the reversibility of the transgene expression. 100 mg of liver or spleen tissue from the transgenic animals was homogenized in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 150 mmsodium chloride, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mmEDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Pefabloc SC, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Total protein concentrations of the lysates were measured using a Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Total RNAs from liver, spleen, brain, tongue, kidney, lung, heart, ovary, skin, and skeletal muscle were isolated using the Ultraspec-II RNA isolation reagent (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX). Briefly, 100 mg of tissue was homogenized using a glass homogenizer in 1 ml of Ultraspec-II RNA isolation reagent. The RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. T antigen was detected by Western blotting using mouse monoclonal anti-TAg antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) with a chemiluminescence detection kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The actin level of each sample was tested as an internal protein control. Reverse transcription was performed using the Thermoscript RT-PCR system kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA was mixed with TAg-specific antisense primer (10 μm), and the volume was adjusted to 10 μl using diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The RNA/primer mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 5 min. 10 μl of the reverse transcription mixture was added to the RNA/primer mixture, and the reaction was continued at 50 °C for 1 h and terminated by heating at 85 °C for 5 min. 1 μl of RNase H was added for an additional 20 min at 37 °C. Synthesized cDNA was amplified by a standard PCR protocol: one cycle at 94 °C for 4 min; 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min; and a final cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR-amplified fragments were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel and analyzed by Southern blotting using 32P-labeled TAg cDNA probe. β-Galactosidase activity in the liver or spleen lysate was measured using the Galacto-light β-galactosidase detection kit (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Briefly, 100 mg of liver or spleen tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of lysis solution containing 10 μl of a 0.1 msolution of dithiothreitol, 1 μl of 30% hydrogen peroxide, and 100 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals; from a stock solution containing one tablet in 1 ml of water). The protein concentration of the lysate was determined, and 100 μg of lysate was used for quantitation of β-galactosidase activity. Recombinant β-galactosidase (Sigma) was used as a positive control, and liver lysate from nontransgenic mice was used as a negative control. The final reaction mixture containing light-emitting substrates was measured using a plate luminometer (Packard Instrument Co.), and the results of the β-galactosidase activity were calculated as counts/min. Offspring of the cross between Alb-tTA line 3123 and tetO-TAg were subjected to tetracycline or placebo treatment continuously for a period of 12 months. These mice were killed at the end of the follow-up period. Livers and other organs were examined for any gross morphological changes. A piece of each tissue was fixed in buffered Formalin, and 8-μm-thick sections were cut. Sections were stained with standard hematoxylin/eosin and evaluated for any histological changes. Two Alb-tTA (lines 3140 and 3123) and three MUP-tTA (lines 7552, 7545, and 7016) transgenic lines were generated. Expression of tTA could be detected by RT-PCR in the livers from all lines (data not shown). The heterozygous animals of each tTA line were crossed with the heterozygoustetO-TAg or tetO-lacZ mice to generate double-positive, single-positive, or double-negative transgenic mice for the experiment. Alb-TAg line 3140 was generated by crossing Alb-tTA 3140 mice with tetO-TAg mice, and Alb-TAg line 3123 was generated by crossing Alb-tTA 3123 mice with tetO-TAg mice. The Alb-lacZ mice were generated the same way. MUP-TAg and MUP-lacZ lines 7552, 7545, and 7016 were generated by crossing each MUP-tTA line with tetO-TAg andtetO-lacZ, respectively. Animals obtained from each cross were divided into three groups based on the genotype, viz. double-positive animals (which contain both tTA and TAg transgenes), tTA single-positive, and TAg single-positive (Fig. 1 B). The latter two groups were used as controls for the binary transgenic system in response to tetracycline administration. In each group, one animal received tetracycline treatment, the second received a placebo, and the third received tetracycline first, followed by 7 days of tetracycline withdrawal. The aim for the third group was to evaluate the reversibility of transgene expression by tetracycline regulation. To assess the tissue-specific regulation of the transgene by tetracycline, we analyzed the livers and various other organs, including the spleen. An identical scheme was followed for the generation of tTA/lacZ mice. The expression of thelacZ transgene was determined by β-galactosidase activity. After treatment, the TAg mice described above were analyzed for TAg expression in the liver, spleen, brain, tongue, kidney, lung, heart, ovary, skin, and skeletal muscle. Fig. 2 shows the levels of TAg expression in the livers and spleens of the Alb-TAg 3140 and 3123 mice and MUP-TAg 7552 mice. TAg expression was detected only in the liver and not in the spleen. RT-PCR analysis for TAg mRNA revealed a complete absence of TAg expression in all the organs listed above, except liver (data not shown). In all these lines, TAg expression was completely abrogated in the liver by tetracycline treatment of the double-positive mice. In animals after 7 days of tetracycline withdrawal (Fig. 2, third lane), TAg expression resumed, although to a lower level compared with the placebo-treated animals. This lower level may be attributed to a gradual disappearance of the tetracycline from the body and/or a less-than-precise time course of tetracycline release from the implanted pellet. The single-positive transgenic mice (TAg or tTA) were completely negative for TAg expression under all conditions, supporting the concept that the binary components of this transgenic model are essential for tetracycline-regulated gene expression. Finally, TAg expression could be detected only in the liver and not in the other tissues, indicating that the expression is tightly regulated only in the targeted tissue. All these results suggest that a tightly regulated, liver-specific gene expression by tetracycline administration can be achieved in this transgenic model. However, it is important to mention that there were considerable variations in the levels of TAg expression between the different mouse lines. In MUP-TAg lines 7545 and 7016, none of the double-positive animals expressed any detectable level of TAg (data not shown). To address whether this tetracycline-regulated transgenic system can be used to direct the conditional expression of any transgene, we evaluated the expression of the lacZ reporter gene using the same approach. Fig. 3 shows the levels oflacZ expression in livers from these various tTA/lacZ lines. The double-positive animals from Alb-lacZ line 3140 and MUP-lacZ line 7552 demonstrated a tight regulation of lacZ expression in the liver by tetracycline, similar to the results obtained with the TAg lines above. Surprisingly, MUP-lacZ line 3123 did not show any LacZ protein activity in the absence of tetracycline, which is contrary to the results obtained with the corresponding TAg line. This could be due to a relatively lower sensitivity of lacZdetection in the livers of the animals. Similar to the tTA/TAg system, gene expression was confined to the liver and was not detected in the spleen. Discontinuation of tetracycline resulted in the resumption oflacZ gene expression in the liver. These findings support the notion that tetracycline-regulated gene expression can be accomplished with any gene of interest. TableI summarizes the findings of all TAg andlacZ lines.Table IRegulated expression of TAg or lacZ in transgenic mouse liversTransgenic lineDouble, TcDouble, PDouble, Tc/WTAg, TcTAg, PtTA, TctTA, PTAglacZTAglacZTaglacZTaglacZTAglacZTAglacZTAglacZ3140−−++++−−−−−−−−3123−−+−+−−−−−−−−−7552−−++++−−−−−−−−7545−−−−−−−−−−−−−−7016−−−−−−−−−−−−−−Alb-TAg or Alb-lacZ line 3140 was generated by crossing Alb-tTA 3140 mice with tetO-TAg ortetO-lacZ mice.

MUP-TAg lines 7552, 7545, and 7016 were generated similarly by crossing the respective MUP-tTA mice with tetO-TAg ortetO-lacZ mice. Genotypes of the offspring were double-positive (bigenic for both tTA and TAg or lacZ; Double), TAg single-positive (TAg or lacZ), or tTA single-positive (tTA). Mice with each genotype were implanted with either tetracycline (Tc) or placebo (P) pellets. A group of double-positive animals was treated with tetracycline, killed, and analyzed 1 week after dissipation of the tetracycline pellet (Tc/W). Each group included at least three animals, and they all behaved similarly. +, animals with TAg or lacZ expression; −, animals that failed to express TAg or lacZ. Open table in a new tab Alb-TAg or Alb-lacZ line 3140 was generated by crossing Alb-tTA 3140 mice with tetO-TAg ortetO-lacZ mice. Alb-TAg or Alb-lacZline 3123 was generated by crossing Alb-tTA 3123 mice withtetop-TAg or tetop-lacZ mice. MUP-TAg lines 7552, 7545, and 7016 were generated similarly by crossing the respective MUP-tTA mice with tetO-TAg ortetO-lacZ mice. Genotypes of the offspring were double-positive (bigenic for both tTA and TAg or lacZ; Double), TAg single-positive (TAg or lacZ), or tTA single-positive (tTA). Mice with each genotype were implanted with either tetracycline (Tc) or placebo (P) pellets.

Each group included at least three animals, and they all behaved similarly. +, animals with TAg or lacZ expression; −, animals that failed to express TAg or lacZ. To determine whether there is a low level expression of the transgene under suppressed conditions (by tetracycline) that is below the limit of the protein detection method above, total RNA was isolated from all groups (double-positive and tTA and TAg single-positive mice) with or without tetracycline treatment and subjected to RT-PCR analysis. RT-PCR can detect as few as 1000 copies of TAg transcripts, which translates to less than one copy/cell (10 μg of total RNA for RT-PCR, equivalent to ∼104 cells), and thereby is much more sensitive than Western blotting. The results of the RT-PCR analysis of these RNA samples are shown in Fig.4. Tetracycline treatment resulted in the complete absence of TAg transcripts compared with the placebo group (Fig. 4, lane 1). The tetracycline withdrawal group also showed detectable levels of TAg RNA, supportive of the reversal of the tetracycline regulation. Furthermore, the absence of TAg transcripts in the TAg single-positive mice is consistent with the notion that this transgene, in the absence of tTA, is completely silent. It is well known that constitutive expression of TAg in transgenic mouse models is oncogenic. At 4 weeks of age, double- and single-positive animals from Alb-TAg line 3123 were subjected continuously to tetracycline or placebo treatment for a period of 12 months and killed. Gross morphological examination of the livers, spleens, kidneys, lungs, hearts, brains, and skeletal muscles of all the animals was performed. Evidence of hepatic neoplasia was present in three out of five animals that were double-positive (TableII). One of them had a large liver tumor. Histological evaluation revealed hepatocellular adenoma with loss of lobular architecture and compression of tissues adjacent to the adenoma (Fig. 5, F and G). The hepatocytes within the adenoma were irregularly arranged with considerable pleomorphism, large heterochromatic nuclei, many mitotic figures, and intracellular fat vacuoles (lipidosis and steatosis). No well defined portal triads or central veins or sinusoids were noticed. The other two mice had multiple microscopic foci of nodular hyperplasia, and one of them had a microadenoma. These hyperplastic foci stood out as pale areas among the pink hepatic parenchyma and were distributed in all lobes of the liver (Fig. 5, B andC). Histological examination showed similar pathological changes to those of the adenoma described above. In contrast, none of the tetracycline-treated animals developed any evidence of tumor in the liver as revealed by histological examination (Fig. 5, A,D, and E). In all cases, tumors were confined to the liver only, which again supports the notion that this regulatable system can be precisely operated in a time-dependent and tissue-specific manner. All other organs appeared grossly normal without evidence of tumors. It is possible that they may have microscopic pathology, but in the complete absence of TAg expression, it is unlikely.Table IIRegulation of tumor induction by tetracycline treatmentTransgeneTetracycline treatmentNo. of mice with liver tumorDouble+ (n = 5)0 (0%)− (n = 5)3 (60%)+/w (n = 3)0 (0%)tTA single+ (n = 2)0 (0%)− (n = 2)0 (0%)TAg single+ (n = 2)0 (0%)− (n = 2)0 (0%)Double- and single-positive animals derived from Alb-TAg line 3123 were treated continuously with tetracycline or placebo for a period of 12 months and killed.

In this study, we developed a binary transgenic system in which the E. coli tetracycline regulon was genetically engineered to achieve a tightly regulated, liver-specific gene expression in vivo. The liver-specific expression was accomplished using a liver-specific promoter (the mouse albumin or mouse major urinary protein promoter) to drive the tetracycline-sensitive tTA in one transgenic lineage; the other transgenic lineage contains the reporter gene (SV40 TAg or lacZ) under the control of thetetO promoter, to which tTA, in the absence of tetracycline, binds and activates. Analyses of the double transgenic mice showed that two of the three Alb-tTA lines and one of the two MUP-tTA lines exhibited the desirable phenotype of conditional expression in the liver. The expression of both reporter transgenes could be completely suppressed by tetracycline administration; such a suppression could be reversed upon discontinuation of tetracycline. The biological significance of this system was confirmed by the phenotypic study of the TAg mice, in which the double transgenic animals developed liver neoplasia in the absence of tetracycline, and the tetracycline-treated group had normal liver histology. SV40 T antigen has been shown to be tumorigenic in transgenic mice (16Araki K. Hino O. Miyazaki J. Yamamura K. Carcinogenesis.. 1991; 12: 2059-2062Google Scholar, 17Bennoun M. Rissel M. Engelhardt N.

Constitutive expression of TAg in the liver leads to massive hepatomegaly and development of liver tumors by 5 months of age (20Hino O. Kitagawa T. Nomura K. Ohtake K. Cui L. Furuta Y. Aizawa S. Jpn. J. Cancer Res... 1991; 82: 1226-1233Google Scholar). Although we have not performed a detailed kinetic study of tumor development, three of five mice in the absence of continuous tetracycline developed gross and histological hyperplasia and/or neoplasia at 12 months of age. The less oncogenic potential of TAg in our model probably reflects a lower level of TAg expression than in other TAg transgenic mouse models. In a similar study by Ewald et al. (21Ewald D. Li M. Efrat S. Auer G. Wall R.J. Furth P.A. Hennighausen L. Science.. 1996; 273: 1384-1386Google Scholar), the tetracycline-regulated expression of TAg was targeted to the salivary glands of mice. These mice developed ductal hyperplasia at 4 months of age. Importantly, tumor development could be abolished by tetracycline administration at 4 months, but not at 7 months, of age. However, it is not clear whether the time or the stage of the cancer is crucial for tumor suppression. In our model, we do not know what the threshold time point is for tumor regression by tetracycline. Further experiments are underway to address these issues. Several transgenic mouse models have been developed using the tetracycline-regulated system in various target tissues or organs. Gossen and Bujard (22Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1992; 89: 5547-5551Google Scholar) were able to achieve tetracycline-regulated gene expression in lymphoid cells, and Passman and Fishman (23Passman R.S. Fishman G.I. J. Clin. Invest... 1994; 94: 2421-2425Google Scholar) in cardiac muscles. In another study, the rat liver enriched activator protein promoter was used for liver-specific expression of tTA; however, reporter gene (luciferase) expression could be detected in several organs such as spleen, heart, brain, and liver under the induced conditions (24Kistner A. Gossen M. Zimmermann F. Jerecic J. Ullmer C. Lubbert H. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 10933-10938Google Scholar). In all these studies, it is not clear whether one can achieve near-complete suppression of the transgene by tetracycline administration with more sensitive techniques such as PCR. Other conditional expression systems have been applied to the transgenic and knockout technology. The most notable one is thecre-lox system (8Sauer B.

Although one can achieve tissue-specific targeting using a tissue-specific promoter to expresscre, the recombination mediated by lox is often incomplete, and the effect of viral vectors may have untoward functional effects on the targeted tissues (28Wakita T.

Development ofcre transgenic mice under the control of tissue-specific promoters can overcome the viral effects, but the advantage of specific timing of conditional expression is lost. In addition, thecre-lox-mediated recombination is not reversible, thereby mitigating the potential of an on-off regulation.

A system using the antiprogestin mifepristone and progesterone receptor ligand-binding domain fusion protein to regulate gene expression has been developed in transgenic mice (32Serguera C. Bohl D. Rolland E. Prevost P. Heard J.M. Hum. Gene Ther... 1999; 10: 375-383Google Scholar). Although several orders of magnitude of induction of the transgene can be achieved in vivo, it is not clear whether the dose of mifepristone used for induction exerts any unforeseen biological effects on the animals or what the basal level expression of the transgene is. Furthermore, the slow kinetics of regulation by mifepristone in vivo limited the usefulness of this system (32Serguera C. Bohl D. Rolland E. Prevost P. Heard J.M. Hum. Gene Ther... 1999; 10: 375-383Google Scholar). Our study has several biological implications. First, it is possible keep the expression of a transgene completely silent in the liver and to induce its expression at any desirable time point in a reversible manner. This would allow a precise evaluation of the true biological functions of any gene in the liver in the context of the defined physiological or pathophysiological state of the animal without other compensatory or epigenetic events. Second, this model system can be applied to the silencing of an endogenous gene in a reversible, time-dependent manner. For example, cre could be placed under the control of the tetracycline-regulated system for specific knockout of a gene, or an antisense transgene could be designed to suppress the expression of an endogenous gene in the liver. Third, by completely silencing the transgene during the fetal stage, it is possible to avert the thymic selection process of a transgene as a self-antigen and therefore to characterize the immunologic responses to the transgene later in the animal's life. This can be applied to the study of autoantigens or viral infections. The latter approach is particularly valuable for hepatitis C, in which there is no convenient small animal model. A previous study has reported the induction of the hepatitis C virus core-specific immune response using the cre-lox system to induce the expression of the core transgene in liver (28Wakita T. Taya C. Katsume A. Kato J. Yonekawa H. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Hayashi Y. Koike M. Kohara M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 9001-9006Google Scholar). However, the presence of a strong anti-adenoviral immunity (delivery of cre by adenovirus to the liver) precluded detailed characterization of the effects of an anti-hepatitis C virus response in vivo. We are hopeful that our model system will pave the way for the more precise study of any endogenous or exogenous genes and their interactions with the immune system in the context of viral immunopathology, hepatocarcinogenesis, autoimmunity, or other forms of liver disease.

Two classes of differentiation factors, the neurotrophins and fibroblast growth factors, induce rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of SNT1(FRS2α), which in turn enables SNT1 to recruit Shp2 tyrosine phosphatase and Grb2 adaptor protein in complex with the Ras GDP/GTP exchange factor Sos. To determine effector functions of SNT that promote neuronal differentiation of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, we engineered a chimeric protein, SNT1(IRS)CX, bearing the effector region of SNT1 and the insulin receptor recognition domains of IRS2. Insulin promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of SNT1(IRS)CX in transfected PC12 cells accompanied by sustained activation of ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases and neuronal differentiation. The SNT1(IRS)CX-mediated response was dependent on endogenous Ras, MEK, and Shp2 activities. Mutagenesis of SNT1(IRS)CX identified three classes of effector motifs within SNT critical for both sustained ERK activation and neuronal differentiation: 1) four phosphotyrosine motifs that mediate recruitment of Grb2, 2) two phosphotyrosine motifs that mediate recruitment of Shp2, and 3) a C-terminal motif that functions by helping to recruit Sos.

Within the developing vertebrate nervous system, proliferating progenitor cells differentiate into post-mitotic neurons under the control of specific secreted polypeptide growth factors.

Other growth factors and protein hormones, such as epidermal growth factor and insulin, also signal through RTKs present on neuronal progenitor cells, but these factors promote proliferative or anti-apoptotic responses without favoring differentiation. Elucidating the RTK signaling pathways specific to the neuronal differentiation response has been the subject of extensive research over the past decade (1Chao M.V.

SNT1 (also termed FRS2α) and SNT2 (FRS2β) are related membrane-anchored docking proteins (5Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J.

These interactions have suggested the importance of SNTs in the differentiation response, because experiments with dominant-negative protein inhibitors have shown that Ras and Shp2 are required for neurotrophin- and FGF-induced differentiation of PC12 neuronal progenitor cells (12Szeberenyi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 13Wright J.H. Drueckes P. Bartos J. Zhao Z. Shen S.H. Krebs E.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1575-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of SNT1 in PC12 cells potentiates the length of FGF-induced neurites in a Ras- and Shp2-dependent manner (5Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Although activation of Ras and Shp2 are critical events in neuronal differentiation, these proteins are also activated by cell stimulation with the nondifferentiating growth factors epidermal growth factor and insulin (14Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 15Feng G. Hui C. Pawson T.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of neuronal differentiation must require activation of additional signaling pathways or be dependent on the magnitude or duration of Ras and Shp2 stimulation. A downstream target of both Ras and Shp2, the ERK, mitogen-activated protein kinase, undergoes prolonged activation in response to neuronal differentiation factors but only transient activation in response to other growth factors (3Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that sustained ERK activation is necessary and sufficient to drive neuronal differentiation, because only sustained activation allows for substantial ERK nuclear translocation and potential phosphorylation and activation of key transcription factors (3Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar). We have developed a robust methodology to corroborate whether SNT tyrosine phosphorylation can drive sustained ERK activation and the neuronal differentiation response, and to analyze SNT effector domains required for SNT's functional attributes. Using this methodology, we show that SNT activation drives sustained ERK activity and neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. We further identify three effector functions on SNT1 that act coordinately to mediate downstream responses. Mouse monoclonal antibodies used were 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine (pY) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anti-Ras and anti-Shp2 (PTP1D) (Transduction Laboratories), 12CA5 anti-HA tag and 9E10 anti-Myc tag (courtesy of T. Moran), and E10 anti-phospho-ERK (p-ERK1/2) (New England BioLabs). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies included anti-Grb2 and anti-Sos1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-ERK (ERK1/2) (New England BioLabs). Conjugated secondary antibodies were from CALTAG Laboratories: Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, mouse IgG1, and mouse IgG2b, alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1, FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1, and biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG2b. Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin was from CALTAG, unconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, and protein G-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and ECL was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Mouse NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% bovine calf serum, rat PC12 cells (variant from M. Chao's laboratory, kindly provided by R. Krauss) were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Both cells were grown in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. PD98059 was from New England BioLabs. Acidic FGF was purified fromEscherichia coli (18Clements D. Wang J.-K. Dionne C. Schlessinger J. Goldfarb M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1311-1316PubMed Google Scholar), recombinant rat β-NGF was from R&D Systems, and recombinant human insulin was from Sigma. Cells were starved for 2 h in serum-free medium and subsequently treated with 100 ng/ml FGF plus 5 μg/ml heparin, 5 μg/ml insulin, or 50 ng/ml NGF for times as indicated in the figures. Cells were lysed with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, and nuclei were removed by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitations, antibodies were incubated with lysates overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates from polyclonal antibodies were captured directly with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h, whereas immunoprecipitates from monoclonal antibodies were captured with protein G-Sepharose preincubated with goat anti-mouse IgG (100 μg/ml gel). Beads were pelleted and washed twice with lysis buffer before eluting proteins by boiling in sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) (7.5% or 10% polyacrylamide), electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore), and probed with primary antibodies as indicated in the figures, followed by incubation with corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (typically 1:10,000 dilution) and detection by ECL. Apparent molecular weights of proteins were estimated based on migration of prestained molecular weight standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Myc-tagged SNT1 expression vector was derived by inserting full-length human SNT1 cDNA into the cloning sites of a modified pSRα mammalian cell expression vector bearing a triple Myc epitope tag sequence 3′ of the cDNA cloning sites (6Xu H. Lee K.W. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17987-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged SNT1 point mutants (Y436F; Y471F; 2YF = Y436F/Y471F; 4YF = Y196F/Y306F/Y349F/Y392F; 6YF = 2YF + 4YF) in pSRα vector were engineered by ligating together PCR-derived SNT fragments using primers that incorporated Y → F mutations and either naturally occurring or engineered restriction enzyme cleavage sites. Myc-tagged SNT1-ΔT mutation was generated by PCR using sense primer 5′ to the start codon and antisense primer corresponding to the C-terminal region of SNT1 through Thr-495. Myc-tagged SNT1(IRS) in pSRα vector was constructed by PCR from segments of human SNT1 and murine IRS2 (kindly provided by R. Kohanski) and contained (N-terminal to C-terminal) IRS2-(1–307), ArgPro linker segment, SNT1-(138–508), and triple Myc tag. pSRα-SNT1(IRS)CX was made by ligating annealed oligonucleotides encoding the K-ras(B) C-terminal membrane-targeting sequence (CAAX motif: KDGKKKKKKSRTRCTVM) (19Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) into the position C-terminal to the triple Myc-tag sequence of pSRα-SNT1(IRS). Myc-tagged SNT1(IRS)CX mutants (2YF, 4YF, 6YF, and ΔT) were engineered by replacing restriction enzyme segments of pSRα-SNT1(IRS)CX with corresponding mutant segments of SNT1 2YF, 4YF, 6YF, or ΔT. NIH3T3 cells (8 × 105 per 10-cm dish) were cotransfected as calcium phosphate precipitates (20Wigler M. Sweet R. Sim G.K. Wold B. Pellicer A. Lacy E. Maniatis T. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1979; 16: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) with 5 μg of SNT1 expression plasmid, 1 μg of pLTRneo, and 25 μg of human placental carrier DNA and selected with G418 (400 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) to establish pools of stably transfected cells. PC12 cells were transiently transfected with pSRα-Myc-tagged SNT-derived constructs or with corresponding HA-epitope-tagged constructs in which the triple Myc tag was replaced with annealed oligonucleotides encoding two tandem copies of the HA-epitope sequence (YDVPDYAS). For transient transfection of single plasmids, ∼1.2 × 106 cells per 60-mm dish were transfected with 3 μg of expression plasmids and 16 μl of LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total of 3 ml. For transient cotransfection, 0.5 μg of Myc-tagged pSRα-SNT1(IRS)CX was mixed with 2.5 μg of pCEV29-RasN17 (kindly provided by A. Chan), pCMV-HA-Shp2C459S (kindly provided by B. Neel), or corresponding empty vectors and transfected with LipofectAMINE, as above. For PC12-stable transfections, each Myc-tagged SNT1(IRS)CX open reading frame was first shuttled into the expression vector pMIRB (21Lin H.-Y. Xu J. Ornitz D.M. Halegoua S. Hayman M.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4579-4587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by D. Ornitz) for expression driven by Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR as a bicistronic mRNA bearing a downstream IRES-neo-cassette. ∼1.5 × 107 PC12 cells were electroporated (250 V/500 microfarads) in a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) in 1 ml of DMEM containing 40 μg of linearized pMIRB vectors, and plated onto two 10-cm dishes. Three days after transfection, 800 μg/ml G418 was added and maintained for 3 weeks. G418-resistant clones were picked, expanded, maintained in 200 μg/ml G418, and screened for similar level of protein expression by both immunoblot and Myc-immunostaining. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA samples (10 μg per lane) were electrophoresed through 1.1% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde in MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA), and then transferred overnight to HyBond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Full-length VGF cDNA (kindly provided by S. Halegoua) was radiolabeled with 32P-dNTPs (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by DNA polymerase and random hexamer primers and hybridized to the blot using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) at 68 °C for 2 h, washed to a final stringency of 50 °C, 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and autoradiographed. To confirm equivalent loading and transfer of RNA samples, the blot was reprobed under the same conditions with32P-labeled rat glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. A GST-RafRBD (Ras-binding domain) fusion protein, which can bind Ras·GTP (kindly provided by S. Taylor), was expressed in E. coli and purified on glutathione-agarose at 2 mg of fusion protein per 1 ml of beads, as previously described (22Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were lysed in Mg2+-containing lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Nonidet P-40). 250 μg of clarified lysates was incubated with 15 μl of GST-RafRBD-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C, resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted with anti-Ras monoclonal antibody. Transiently transfected PC12 cells were treated with growth factors in serum-containing medium for 2 or 3 days. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min. After blocking in 10% bovine calf serum/PBS for 1 h, cells were incubated with 0.3 μg/ml 9E10 anti-Myc for 1 h, with 1:5000 AP-conjugated secondary anti-mouse IgG1 for 0.5 h, and stained with nitro blue tetrazolium (440 μg/ml) + 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (165 μg/ml) in alkaline substrate buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 9.5, 0.1m NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mm levamisole) for 15–60 min. Neurite outgrowth was quantitated by scoring the percentage of stained cells with neurites longer than the size of two cell bodies and, in some cases, normalized to a maximum of 100%. Generally 400 stained cells were counted per condition in two independent experiments. Representative images were photographed with a digital camera attached to a Leica inverted light microscope. PC12 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged pSRα-SNT1(IRS)CX plasmids or pCMV-HA-Shp2C459S. After 24 h, cells were split into Lab-Tek 4-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) precoated with poly-d-lysine (1 mg/ml for 2 h, Sigma) and laminin (10 μg/ml overnight, Sigma). 48 h post-transfection, cells were serum-starved for 2 h, and then treated with growth factors for 3 h. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min. All blocking or antibody incubation steps were with 10% goat serum in PBT (PBS + 0.25% Tween 20), whereas all washing steps were with PBT. After blocking for 1 h, cells were incubated with 1:100 anti-phospho-ERK (IgG1) overnight at 4 °C, then with 1:200 FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1 for 3 h. After extensive wash, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml primary anti-HA (IgG2b) for 2 h, 1:250 secondary biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG2b for 1 h, and 1:5000 Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin for 30 min. Green and red fluorescence was examined under a Zeiss Axiophot 2 fluorescence microscope. The percentage of phospho-ERK-positive cells was quantitated by scoring the number of cells with sustained ERK activity (green) among the transfected cells (red), with 200 transfected cells counted per condition. Representative images were scanned with a Leica TCS-CP confocal laser scanning microscope. FGFs and neurotrophins induce SNT tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas insulin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of multifunctional insulin receptor substrate (IRS) docking proteins. We reasoned that a chimeric SNT/IRS protein bearing the SNT backbone, but containing the insulin receptor recognition domains of IRS, would undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin. We constructed SNT1(IRS), a Myc epitope-tagged SNT1 protein in which the N-terminal 137 amino acid residues of SNT1, bearing a myristoylation motif and the FGFR/Trk receptor-specific PTB domain, were replaced with the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) and PTB domains of IRS2 (residues 1–307) (Fig. 1A). When SNT1(IRS) was stably transfected into NIH3T3 fibroblasts, insulin, but not FGF, could induce SNT1(IRS) tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.1B). The behavior of SNT1(IRS) stood in contrast to transfected SNT1-Myc, which was phosphorylated in response to FGF, but not insulin (Fig. 1B). To test whether SNT1(IRS) could promote neuronal differentiation, Myc-tagged SNT1(IRS) or SNT1 were transiently transfected into PC12 cells, which were subsequently challenged for 2 days with the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF), FGF1, or insulin. Subsequently, transfected cells, as identified by anti-Myc-tag immunostaining (Fig.2A), were scored for neuronal differentiation using neurite outgrowth as the morphological criterion (23Greene L.A. Brain Res. 1977; 133: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although PC12 cells transfected with SNT1 or SNT1(IRS) underwent neuronal differentiation in response to NGF or FGF (Fig.2B), analogous to untransfected cells (data not shown), insulin failed to induce differentiation of SNT1(IRS)-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). Biochemical and biological activities of SNT1 require its plasma membrane attachment mediated by N-terminal myristoylation (5Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The failure of SNT1(IRS) to promote neuronal differentiation may have resulted from reduced membrane association of the chimeric protein lacking the myristoylation motif. Indeed, when SNT1(IRS) subcellular distribution was compared with SNT1 by confocal immunofluorescence analysis of transfected PC12 cells, SNT1(IRS) was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm as opposed to the exclusively plasma membrane localization of SNT1 (Fig. 2C). To relocalize a chimeric SNT1(IRS) protein back to the plasma membrane, we engineered the variant SNT1(IRS)CX (Fig. 1A) by fusing the CAAX farnesylation motif of K-ras to the C terminus (19Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). As anticipated, SNT1(IRS)CX was largely associated with the plasma membrane in transfected PC12 cells (Fig. 2C) and retained the ability to undergo insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in transfected NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1B). When SNT1(IRS)CX was transiently transfected into PC12 cells, it could effectively mediate insulin-induced neuronal differentiation (Fig. 2,A and B) and up-regulation of the VGF differentiation-specific gene transcript (Fig. 2D). This result demonstrates that artificial stimulation of SNT effector functions is sufficient to recapitulate the biological response to neuronal differentiation factors. Differentiation factor-induced PC12 neuronal differentiation requires Ras, MEK, and Shp2 activities (12Szeberenyi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 13Wright J.H. Drueckes P. Bartos J. Zhao Z. Shen S.H. Krebs E.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1575-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and is accompanied by sustained ERK activation. We sought to determine whether SNT1(IRS)CX promotes neuronal differentiation through the same biochemical mechanisms. To determine whether Ras and Shp2 are required for SNT1(IRS)CX-mediated differentiation, Myc-tagged SNT1(IRS)CX was transiently cotransfected with empty vector controls or with dominant-negative mutant forms of Ras (RasN17) or Shp2 (Shp2C459S), and neurite outgrowth was quantitated by scoring Myc-positive cells following 3-day insulin stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3, either RasN17 (Fig. 3A) or Shp2C459S(Fig. 3B) could significantly reduce SNT1(IRS)CX-mediated differentiation induced by insulin. Additional analyses made use of PC12 cells stably transfected with SNT1(IRS)CX (see “Experimental Procedures”). PC12/SNT1(IRS)CX cells were also capable of undergoing insulin-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig.3C). Pretreatment of PC12/SNT1(IRS)CX with the MEK-specific kinase inhibitor PD98059 dramatically reduced insulin-induced differentiation (Fig. 3C). To determine whether SNT1(IRS)CX stimulation promotes sustained ERK activation, parental PC12 and PC12/SNT1(IRS)CX cells were treated with either NGF or insulin for 0.2 or 3 h, and total cell lysates were analyzed for ERK activation by probing immunoblots with monoclonal antibody specific for tyrosine/threonine dually phosphorylated ERKs. As shown in Fig. 4, NGF-induced ERK1 and ERK2 activation in transfected or untransfected cells persists through 3 h, whereas insulin-induced ERK activation in parental PC12 cells is transient and disappears by 3 h post-stimulation. By contrast, ERK activity is strongly persistent in PC12/SNT1(IRS)CX cells stimulated with insulin. The mechanism by which SNT1(IRS)CX mediates sustained ERK activity may be through its ability to mediate sustained Ras activity (Fig. 4). The above results demonstrate that SNT1(IRS)CX promotes PC12 neuronal differentiation through a repertoire of signaling intermediates indistinguishable from those employed by neuronal differentiation factors. We have engineered a series of potential effector mutations in SNT1, guided by previous studies, consensus sequence motifs, and sequence conservation between SNT1 and SNT2. As shown in Fig. 5A, the 4YF mutation converts tyrosines 196, 306, 349, and 392 to phenylalanines. These four tyrosines all bear the Grb2-binding consensus motif YXN and have been shown to mediate Grb2 binding and Ras activation in transfected 293T cells (5Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The 2YF mutation converts tyrosines 436 and 471 to phenylalanines. The sequences surrounding these two tyrosines are identical in SNT2 and very similar in the two C-terminal tyrosines of IRS1 which are known to recruit Shp2; indeed, SNT1 Y436 was shown to be required for efficient Shp2 recruitment (11Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The 6YF mutant combines the mutations of 2YF and 4YF. The ΔT mutation deletes the C-terminal 13 residues of SNT1. The C terminus of SNTs bears no previously described nor readily predictable function, but was targeted for mutation because it is the region of highest sequence homology between SNT1 and SNT2 (Fig. 5A). Each mutant SNT was first assayed in stably transfected NIH3T3 cells for FGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and target protein recruitment (Fig. 5B). Consistent with previous studies (5Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 11Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), 4YF still undergoes FGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, but recruitment of Grb2 and Sos are substantially diminished, whereas Shp2 recruitment is unaffected. Reciprocally, 2YF is unaffected in Grb2 and Sos recruitment, but Shp2 recruitment is abolished. Analogous to IRS·Shp2 interaction (24Pluskey S. Wandless T.J. Walsh C.T. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2897-2900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), Shp2 recruitment to SNT1 probably requires simultaneous, cooperative interactions of Shp2's two SH2 domains with SNT1 tyrosines 436 and 471, because the individual mutation of either of these tyrosines virtually abolishes Shp2 interaction (Fig.5C). ΔT appeared unaffected in tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of Grb2, Sos, and Shp2 in3T3 cells (Fig.5B). For functional studies, each of the mutations described above was shuttled into the SNT1(IRS)CX construct. When expressed in NIH3T3 c"

During platelet activation PMCA is phosphorylated transiently on tyrosine residues resulting in inhibition of the pump that enhances elevation of Ca2+. Tyrosine phosphorylation of many proteins during platelet activation results in their association with the cytoskeleton. Consequently, in the present study we asked if PMCA interacts with the platelet cytoskeleton. We observed that very little PMCA is associated with the cytoskeleton in resting platelets but that ∼80% of total PMCA (PMCA1b + PMCA4b) is redistributed to the cytoskeleton upon activation with thrombin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PMCA during activation was not associated with the redistribution because tyrosine-phosphorylated PMCA was not translocated specifically to the cytoskeleton. Because PMCA b-splice isoforms have C-terminal PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 homology domain (PDZ)-binding domains, a C-terminal peptide was used to disrupt potential PDZ domain interactions. Activation of saponin-permeabilized platelets in the presence of the peptide led to a significant decrease of PMCA in the cytoskeleton. PMCA associated with the cytoskeleton retained Ca2+-ATPase activity. These results suggest that during activation active PMCA is recruited to the cytoskeleton by interaction with PDZ domains and that this association provides a microenvironment with a reduced Ca2+concentration.

Platelet agonists such as thrombin promote Ca2+ release from internal stores and entry through plasma membrane channels (1Rink T.S. Sage S.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 431-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The predominant mechanism for maintenance of low intracellular Ca2+ in unstimulated platelets and the removal of Ca2+ after intracellular store depletion is efflux catalyzed by the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA)1 (2Haynes D.H. Platelets. 1993; 4: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19529-19535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PMCA is a highly regulated enzyme, in terms both of diversity of gene expression and direct modification of enzyme activity (4Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In the platelet, two isoforms are expressed, PMCA1b and PMCA4b (5Paszty K. Kovacs T. Lacabaratz-Porret C. Papp B. Enouf J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19529-19535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) confirmed that PMCA is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues during platelet activation and showed that small GTPases of the Ras family participate in the signaling pathway in thapsigargin- and ionomycin-stimulated platelets.In addition to PMCA, many other platelet proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues during platelet activation. This phosphorylation promotes association of membrane proteins such as the integrin αIIbβ3 and tyrosine kinases such as p60src, p125FAK with the cytoskeleton (7Fox J.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Fox J.E. Shattil S.J. Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Richardson M. Packham M.A. Sanan D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7004-7011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement and a dramatic change in platelet shape. Thus PMCA tyrosine phosphorylation could potentially promote association of PMCA with the cytoskeleton.Another potential mechanism for interaction of PMCA with the cytoskeleton has been described recently. The last four residues of PMCA4b (ETSV) contain the E(T/S)XV motif that has been identified as a target for binding to PDZ domains (9Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 10Kim E. DeMarco S.J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Sheng M. Strehler E.E. J. Biol.

Kim et al. (10Kim E. DeMarco S.J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Sheng M. Strehler E.E. J. Biol.

Thus both of the PMCA isoforms found in the platelet, PMCA1b and PMCA4b, could interact with PDZ domains in the cytoskeleton or other organized structures.In this study, we investigated the association of platelet PMCA with the cytoskeleton of resting and thrombin-activated platelets. We compared the cellular distribution of PMCA during platelet activation with that of p125FAK and investigated whether platelet aggregation and tyrosine phosphorylation of PMCA are required for this association. Finally, we asked if the C-terminal region containing the PDZ domain-binding residues is involved in cytoskeletal association.DISCUSSIONPMCA is the major Ca2+ efflux mediator in human platelets, and it therefore plays a fundamental role in platelet intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (2Haynes D.H. Platelets. 1993; 4: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19529-19535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Changes in the activity and/or distribution of PMCA might have a crucial impact on platelet functions. Our earlier finding that platelet PMCA is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and inhibited in hypertensive individuals resulting in increased cytosolic Ca2+demonstrates the importance of this protein for proper platelet function (14Blankenship K.A. Dawson C.B. Aronoff G.R. Dean W.L. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).After the initial increase of intracellular Ca2+ after activation by strong agonists such as thrombin, platelet shape changes dramatically because of rearrangements of the cytoskeleton. The association of many proteins with the actin cytoskeleton such as the integral membrane protein integrin αIIbβ3and cytosolic nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as p60src and p125FAK requires tyrosine phosphorylation (20Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this report we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of PMCA does not promote association of this protein with the cytoskeleton because the greatest extent ((tyrosine phosphates)/(PMCA)) of PMCA tyrosine phosphorylation in thrombin-activated platelets is either in the supernatant or high speed pellet (Fig. 4). Thus it is the more active, less phosphorylated form that associates with the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton. This implies that the purpose of redistribution of PMCA is to direct the active Ca2+ pump to specific locations in the activated platelet, possibly to reduce intracellular Ca2+ in focal contact regions thus preventing proteolytic degradation by the Ca2+-activated proteinase calpain (19Fox J.E. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The concomitant inhibition of the pump not associated with the cytoskeleton by tyrosine phosphorylation presumably allows for higher accumulation of cytosolic Ca2+ in the bulk of the activated platelet.We showed that the C-terminal PDZ-binding domain of PMCA is involved in the redistribution of PMCA1b and PMCA4b to the actin cytoskeleton (Fig.5). The C-terminal peptide of PMCA4b specifically inhibited PMCA association but had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated association of p60src and p125FAK with the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, a scrambled peptide composed of the same amino acid residues had no effect on PMCA association with the low speed pellet. This provides strong evidence for the role of the C terminus of b-spliced PMCA isoforms in association with the platelet cytoskeleton during activation. Kim et al. (10Kim E. DeMarco S.J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Sheng M. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1591-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) speculated that the role of the PMCA PDZ-binding domain in neuronal cells may be to direct the pump into dendritic spines and restrict signaling by theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor. We propose a similar redistribution of platelet PMCA into focal contacts, possibly in filopodia, to regulate cytosolic Ca2+ in these microdomains.PDZ domains have been shown to be involved in multiprotein complexes often linking plasma membrane proteins to stable subcellular structures (11Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 12Bunn R.C. Jensen M.A. Reed B.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast, PMCA in the platelet only becomes associated with the cytoskeleton after activation and cytoskeletal rearrangement. The mechanism for this behavior could be similar to that described for neuronal F-actin binding proteins such as neurabin-I and -II (26Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These PDZ domain-containing F-actin binding proteins become associated with polymerized actin, but dissociate upon depolymerization of the cytoskeleton. Thus, PMCA could associate with the cytoskeleton in activated platelets by interacting with a PDZ domain containing F-actin binding protein that binds to the reorganized cytoskeleton after activation. Although neurabins have not been reported in platelets, a protein with similar properties, CLP-36, has been described recently (27Bauer K. Kratzer M. Otte M. Luber K. Essler M. Hagmann J. Arnold G. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Siess W. Blood. 2000; 96: 4236-4245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This PDZ domain-containing protein binds to α-actinin in the cytoskeleton of activated platelets by means of a distinct intervening sequence thus leaving the PDZ domain available for interaction with PDZ domain-binding proteins such as PMCA.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PMCA is not associated with the cytoskeleton in resting platelets and that association increases dramatically upon activation with thrombin. Tyrosine phosphorylation does not promote the translocation, but the C-terminal PDZ-binding domain is required for PMCA redistribution. This is the first direct demonstration of a physiologically relevant role for the C-terminal PDZ binding sequence in PMCA4b. Elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+ is essential for efficient activation of platelets. Platelet agonists such as thrombin promote Ca2+ release from internal stores and entry through plasma membrane channels (1Rink T.S. Sage S.O. Annu. Rev.

Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The concomitant inhibition of the pump not associated with the cytoskeleton by tyrosine phosphorylation presumably allows for higher accumulation of cytosolic Ca2+ in the bulk of the activated platelet.We showed that the C-terminal PDZ-binding domain of PMCA is involved in the redistribution of PMCA1b and PMCA4b to the actin cytoskeleton (Fig.5). The C-terminal peptide of PMCA4b specifically inhibited PMCA association but had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated association of p60src and p125FAK with the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, a scrambled peptide composed of the same amino acid residues had no effect on PMCA association with the low speed pellet. This provides strong evidence for the role of the C terminus of b-spliced PMCA isoforms in association with the platelet cytoskeleton during activation. Kim et al. (10Kim E. DeMarco S.J.

We propose a similar redistribution of platelet PMCA into focal contacts, possibly in filopodia, to regulate cytosolic Ca2+ in these microdomains.PDZ domains have been shown to be involved in multiprotein complexes often linking plasma membrane proteins to stable subcellular structures (11Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 12Bunn R.C. Jensen M.A. Reed B.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast, PMCA in the platelet only becomes associated with the cytoskeleton after activation and cytoskeletal rearrangement. The mechanism for this behavior could be similar to that described for neuronal F-actin binding proteins such as neurabin-I and -II (26Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These PDZ domain-containing F-actin binding proteins become associated with polymerized actin, but dissociate upon depolymerization of the cytoskeleton. Thus, PMCA could associate with the cytoskeleton in activated platelets by interacting with a PDZ domain containing F-actin binding protein that binds to the reorganized cytoskeleton after activation. Although neurabins have not been reported in platelets, a protein with similar properties, CLP-36, has been described recently (27Bauer K. Kratzer M. Otte M. Luber K. Essler M. Hagmann J. Arnold G. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Siess W. Blood. 2000; 96: 4236-4245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This PDZ domain-containing protein binds to α-actinin in the cytoskeleton of activated platelets by means of a distinct intervening sequence thus leaving the PDZ domain available for interaction with PDZ domain-binding proteins such as PMCA.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PMCA is not associated with the cytoskeleton in resting platelets and that association increases dramatically upon activation with thrombin. Tyrosine phosphorylation does not promote the translocation, but the C-terminal PDZ-binding domain is required for PMCA redistribution. This is the first direct demonstration of a physiologically relevant role for the C-terminal PDZ binding sequence in PMCA4b. PMCA is the major Ca2+ efflux mediator in human platelets, and it therefore plays a fundamental role in platelet intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (2Haynes D.H. Platelets. 1993; 4: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19529-19535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Changes in the activity and/or distribution of PMCA might have a crucial impact on platelet functions. Our earlier finding that platelet PMCA is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and inhibited in hypertensive individuals resulting in increased cytosolic Ca2+demonstrates the importance of this protein for proper platelet function (14Blankenship K.A. Dawson C.B. Aronoff G.R. Dean W.L. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After the initial increase of intracellular Ca2+ after activation by strong agonists such as thrombin, platelet shape changes dramatically because of rearrangements of the cytoskeleton. The association of many proteins with the actin cytoskeleton such as the integral membrane protein integrin αIIbβ3and cytosolic nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as p60src and p125FAK requires tyrosine phosphorylation (20Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this report we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of PMCA does not promote association of this protein with the cytoskeleton because the greatest extent ((tyrosine phosphates)/(PMCA)) of PMCA tyrosine phosphorylation in thrombin-activated platelets is either in the supernatant or high speed pellet (Fig. 4). Thus it is the more active, less phosphorylated form that associates with the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton. This implies that the purpose of redistribution of PMCA is to direct the active Ca2+ pump to specific locations in the activated platelet, possibly to reduce intracellular Ca2+ in focal contact regions thus preventing proteolytic degradation by the Ca2+-activated proteinase calpain (19Fox J.E.

https://openalex.org/W2046390517,"Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) plays a central role in skeletal growth by promoting bone cell replication and differentiation. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and parathyroid hormone enhance cAMP production in cultured rat osteoblasts and stimulate IGF-I expression through a transcriptional mechanism mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). We previously showed that PGE2 activated the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (C/EBPdelta) in osteoblasts and induced its binding to a DNA element within the IGF-I promoter. We report here that a PKA-dependent pathway stimulates nuclear translocation of C/EBPdelta. Under basal conditions, C/EBPdelta was cytoplasmic but rapidly accumulated in the nucleus after PGE2 treatment (t(1/2) < 30 min). Nuclear translocation occurred without concurrent protein synthesis and was maintained in the presence of hormone. Nuclear localization required PKA and was blocked by a dominant-interfering regulatory subunit of the enzyme, even though C/EBPdelta was not a PKA substrate. Upon removal of hormonal stimulus, C/EBPdelta quickly exited the nucleus (t(1/2) < 12 min) through a pathway blocked by leptomycin B. Mutagenesis studies indicated that the basic domain of C/EBPdelta was necessary for nuclear localization and that the leucine zipper region permitted full nuclear accumulation. We thus define a pathway for PKA-mediated activation of C/EBPdelta through its regulated nuclear import."

Ten major proteins were consistently detected in TIFF, and six species were identified by mass spectrometry as actin, porin, comitin, regulatory myosin light chain, a novel member of the CD36 family, and the phospholipid-anchored cell adhesion molecule gp80. TIFF was enriched with many acylated proteins. Also, the sterol/phospholipid ratio of TIFF was 10-fold higher than that of the bulk plasma membrane. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that TIFF has vesicular morphology and confirmed the association of gp80 and comitin with TIFF membranes. Several TIFF properties were similar to those ofDictyostelium contact regions, which were isolated as a cytoskeleton-associated membrane fraction. Mass spectrometry demonstrated that TIFF and contact regions shared the same major proteins. During development, gp80 colocalized with F-actin, porin, and comitin at cell-cell contacts. These proteins were also recruited to gp80 caps induced by antibody cross-linking. Filipin staining revealed high sterol levels in both gp80-enriched cell-cell contacts and gp80 caps. Moreover, sterol sequestration by filipin and digitonin inhibited gp80-mediated cell-cell adhesion.

However, certain membranes display elevated acyl chain order and exist in a liquid-ordered phase. These membranes exhibit Triton X-100 insolubility and can be separated from other insoluble cellular material by floatation into density gradients after isopycnic centrifugation (1Brown D.A.

We will refer to these membranes as a Triton X-100-insoluble floating fraction (TIFF).1 TIFF has distinctive structural properties and is involved in a variety of cellular functions. TIFF is typically isolated as membrane vesicles (4Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar, 5Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P.

These membranes are enriched in lipids, such as cholesterol and those with saturated acyl chains, which are expected to pack closely within the liquid-ordered environment (7Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8047) Google Scholar). In addition, many cell membrane-associated structural and signaling proteins have been found in TIFF (8Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). TIFF proteins are often anchored to the membranes through a lipid moiety (7Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8047) Google Scholar). TIFF was originally characterized in vertebrate cells (4Brown D.A. Rose J.K.

Dictyostelium is a favorable model organism for the study of plasma membrane structure and function. Dictyostelium is amenable to both biochemical and molecular genetic analyses of its cellular and developmental processes. During Dictyosteliumdevelopment, unicellular amoeboid cells aggregate through chemotaxis toward cAMP and embark on a multicellular developmental program (21Loomis W.F. Dictyostelium discoideum: A Developmental System. Academic Press, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). Three components of the cAMP signaling pathway (the cAMP receptor cAR1, adenylate cyclase, and the cell surface phosphodiesterase) are found in CHIFF, suggesting that they are components of specialized microdomains on the plasma membrane (11Xiao Z.

It is apparent that gp80-gp80 interactions mediate cell-cell adhesion among Dictyostelium cells. However, structural details of gp80 adhesion complexes are largely unknown. Intriguingly, gp80 is enriched in Triton X-100-insoluble, cytoskeleton-associated contact regions (41Ingalls H.M. Goodloe-Holland C.M. Luna E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4779-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This subcellular fraction contains stacked membranes with dimensions of intact cell-cell contacts and can only be isolated after the cell aggregation stage of development. Considering that gp80 is phospholipid-anchored (42Sadeghi H. da Silva A.M. Klein C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5512-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 43Stadler J. Keenan T.W. Bauer G. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that these Triton X-100-insoluble contact regions may be a form of TIFF and that gp80 adhesion complexes may be organized as distinct membrane domains within the plasma membrane. In the present study, we have isolated Dictyostelium TIFF, characterized its morphology, identified its protein constituents, and analyzed its lipid composition. We demonstrate that TIFF membranes share many common physical and biochemical properties with the Triton X-100-insoluble contact regions. Furthermore, a role for TIFF components during gp80-mediated adhesion is established through colocalization, co-capping, and adhesion perturbation studies. Dictyostelium cells, including the wild-type axenic strain AX2 and the gp80-null strain GT10 (36Harloff C. Gerisch G. Noegel A.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2011-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), were cultured either in association with Klebsiella aerogenes or axenically in HL5 liquid medium (44Sussman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 9-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). For development, cells at the late exponential growth phase were collected, washed, and resuspended at 1.5 × 107 cells/ml in MCM buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 20 mm MES, pH 6.8) (45Aizawa H. Sutoh K. Yahara I. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and then shaken at 180 rpm. To stimulate gp80 expression, cells were pulsed with cAMP at a final concentration of 2 × 10−8m every 7 min. Cells were also developed in MCM buffer on coverslips. A GFP-comitin construct was produced by end-filling an EcoRI fragment containing the comitin cDNA (46Greenwood M.T. Tsang A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), followed by subcloning into the end-filledHindIII site of the Dictyostelium expression vector pBS18-74E (obtained from Dr. R. Firtel, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA). Expression of comitin was under the control of the actin 15 promoter. The BamHI/BglII fragment of pBS-GFPII (obtained from Dr. H. MacWilliams, Ludwig Maximillian University, Munich, Germany), containing the entire coding region of GFP, was then subcloned into the BglII site of comitin in the resulting plasmid. Hence, GFP was inserted in-frame between Arg15 and Ser16 of comitin. Plasmid DNA was introduced into AX2 cells by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (47Early A.E. Williams J.G. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 59: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Stable transformants were selected and maintained in HL5 medium containing 20 μg/ml of G418. TIFF was isolated from cell aggregates that were collected at 12 h of development and gently resuspended at 5 × 107 cells/ml in cold buffer 1 (40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm sodium azide, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6). Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.2% (v/v), and the suspension was shaken at 180 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C. The insoluble material was centrifuged at 14,500 ×g, and the pellet was washed with buffer 1, centrifuged at 14,500 × g, washed with buffer 2 (1 mmEGTA, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6), and centrifuged at 14,500 × g. The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer 2 and mixed at a 1:2 ratio with 60% (w/w) sucrose, placed at the bottom of a centrifuge tube, and then overlaid with an 11-ml continuous gradient of 10–40% (w/w) sucrose. The gradients were centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 15–17 h at 2 °C using a Beckman SW40 rotor. The TIFF material banded at ∼34% sucrose was collected. In subsequent experiments, TIFF was isolated in discontinuous gradients from the interface between 28 and 38% sucrose. TIFF collected from the sucrose gradients was washed with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, and then pelleted by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 20 min at 2 °C. Plasma membranes were isolated using the aqueous two-phase polymer system (48Siu C.-H. Lerner R.A. Loomis W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 469-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Triton X-100-insoluble contact regions were isolated according to Ingalls et al. (41Ingalls H.M. Goodloe-Holland C.M. Luna E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4779-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 4000 × g. The pellet was washed and resuspended in buffer 2 and then layered on the top of a discontinuous gradient of 5.5 ml of 50% and 5.5 ml of 60% (w/w) sucrose in 20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.8, for centrifugation at 120,000 ×g for 3 h at 2 °C. The material banded at the interface was collected, washed, and dialyzed in a cytoskeleton depolymerizing solution containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. The dialyzed material was pelleted, resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer 2, and layered on top of an 11-ml continuous gradient of 26–51% (w/w) sucrose. The gradient was centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 3 h at 2 °C. Membranes banded at 32–34% sucrose were collected. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). For SDS-PAGE, proteins were solubilized and reduced by boiling for 5 min in 3% (w/v) SDS, 3 m urea and 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and then separated in a slab gel (49Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoblots were quantified using the Bio-Rad Fluor-S Max multiimager system. For protein identification by mass spectrometry, silver-stained gel bands were excised, macerated, reduced, alkylated, and then digested with trypsin. The tryptic peptides were extracted using the protocol of Shevchenko et al. (50Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 58: 850-858Crossref Scopus (7783) Google Scholar). The peptides were purified using Sephasil C18 resin, applied to MALDI plates, and mixed with a matrix solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid (Sigma) at 20 mg/ml in 50% (v/v) acetone and 50% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol. The samples were dried and then subjected to mass spectrometry. Peptide masses were determined using a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager Elite MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc.) in the linear mode, with 92% grid voltage, 0.15% guide wire voltage, laser intensities between 1600 and 2100, and delayed extraction of 200 ns. Trypsin autolysis products and matrix molecules were used for calibration. The remaining masses were submitted to the ProFound search engine and the Protein Prospector search engine (both available on the World Wide Web) for matches. Search parameters were held constant, including tolerance for peptide mass error of ±1 Da, tolerance for protein mass error of ±10 kDa from apparent molecular masses determined by SDS-PAGE, and a maximum of one missed cut per peptide. Cells expressing GFP-comitin were collected at 10 h of development for TIFF isolation. TIFF membranes were incubated overnight with anti-gp80 mAb 80L5C4 (29Siu C.-H. Lam T.Y. Choi A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16030-16036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-GFP rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) plus 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, with rotation at 4 °C. After washing, samples were incubated with either goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to 10-nm gold (Sigma) at 1:10 dilution in TBS plus 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Samples were rotated overnight at 4 °C. After four washes, pellets were fixed overnight at 4 °C with 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. After several washes, the pellets were incubated in 1% (w/v) OsO4 in phosphate buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were dehydrated with an ethanol series followed by propylene oxide and then embedded in Spurr's standard resin. Ultrathin sections were cut with a diamond knife and then stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate prior to examination under a Hitachi 8600 analytical transmission electron microscope. To perform Triton X-100 extraction of living cells, cell aggregates on coverslips were chilled to 4 °C by replacing the MCM buffer with cold buffer 1 and placing the coverslips on an ice water bath for 15 min, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.2% (v/v). After 5 min, the Triton X-100 solution was aspirated, and the coverslips were fixed with cold 10% (v/v) formaldehyde for 10 min on ice, followed by 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde at 22 °C for 10 min. Cells were stained and prepared for confocal microscopy. Cells were developed at 2 × 107 cells/ml for 2 h in 17 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.1, containing streptomycin (0.5 mg/ml). Cells were collected and resuspended in phosphate buffer containing 0.1 mCi/ml of [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and developed for another 6 h with cAMP pulsing. Cell aggregates were collected, and proteins in different subcellular fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein blots were coated with EN3HANCE spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C for 3 weeks. Samples were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography as described previously (51Ravandi A. Kuksis A. Shaikh N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16494-16500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, sample lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and digested with phospholipase C (Clostridium welchii). The mixture was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) containing 100 μg of tridecanoylglycerol as an internal standard. The samples were then incubated in SYLON BFT plus 1 part dry pyridine for 30 min at 20 °C. All extracted lipids are converted into neutral species by this procedure, and they were quantified after separation on a nonpolar capillary column. Cells were developed for 12 h on coverslips and then fixed, stained, and mounted as previously described (52Sesaki H. Siu C.-H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 504-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 53Sesaki H. Wong E.F.S. Siu C.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Samples were first incubated with primary antibodies against gp80 or porin, followed by Alexa 568/488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) at 1:300 dilution. Filamentous actin (F-actin) was stained with fluorescein-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) at 1:10 dilution. Laser-scanning confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted microscope equipped with a × 63 Neofluor objective and an LSM 410 confocal attachment. Detection was maintained within the range of the gray scale to prevent signal saturation. For filipin staining, cells were grown axenically, developed on coverslips, and then fixed in 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde in MCM buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with 0.025% (w/v) filipin in MCM buffer for 15 min at room temperature, washed, and then mounted for epifluorescence microscopy. Cells were developed in suspension for 6–8 h with cAMP pulsing. Cell aggregates were dispersed and deposited on coverslips in MCM buffer (3 × 105cells/coverslip). After 10 min, anti-gp80 mAb or polyclonal antibodies were added to cells for 15 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed gently with two changes of 10 ml of MCM buffer for 3 min. Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibodies were added at 1:50 dilution for 15 min, followed by two washes. The cells were fixed at 40 min after the initial addition of the primary antibody. To identify co-capped molecules, fixed cells were stained with appropriate antibodies. Cell cohesion was assayed as described previously (54Lam T.Y. Pickering G. Geltosky J. Siu C.-H. Differentiation. 1981; 20: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the effects of various reagents on cell cohesion were assayed by measuring aggregate dissociation under high shear force. Cells were cultured on bacteria plates and then collected for development in liquid culture at 2 × 107 cells/ml. At different time points, cell aliquots were taken and diluted in 17 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.1, plus the reagent under test. Stock solutions of filipin and digitonin were prepared fresh in Me2SO prior to each experiment. Equivalent amounts of Me2SO were added to control samples. Cell aggregates were incubated in various reagents for 10 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Shear force was then applied by continuous vortexing for 30 s using a Vortex Genie 2 at setting 8. Cell dissociation was quantified by counting cells with a hemacytometer. Singlets, doublets, and triplets were scored as dissociated cells, and the percentage of cell dissociation was calculated relative to the number of cells obtained at 0 h, which was ∼2 × 106 cells/ml. TIFF was isolated fromDictyostelium cells after 10–12 h of development in liquid medium. After fractionation of detergent-insoluble material in a continuous sucrose density gradient (Fig.1 A), TIFF formed a sharp band at ∼34% sucrose (Fig. 1 A, lane 9), whereas the cytoskeleton pelleted (Fig. 1 A, lane 13). The highly resolved banding pattern suggested that TIFF had a relatively homogeneous composition. This isolation protocol routinely yielded 0.8–0.9 mg of TIFF protein from 1010cells. Silver staining of TIFF proteins revealed a highly reproducible profile (Fig. 1 B). The 10 most strongly stained bands were designated with “t” followed by their apparent molecular mass in kDa. Protein identification was attempted using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and data base search engines. Protein bands designated t103, t88, t43, t28, t23, and t20 were identified to be theDictyostelium expressed sequence tag (EST) C84888, gp80, actin, porin, comitin, and regulatory myosin light chain (RMLC), respectively (Fig. 1 C). These proteins produced the strongest mass spectra of the 10 analyzed. As an example, the mass spectrum of t103 is shown (Fig. 1 D). Their identifications displayed similar ranks and scores, based on two search engines. They each had similar sequence coverage with their matches and displayed the expected electrophoretic mobility. Since the identification of t103 was limited to one search engine, a postsource decay analysis was performed (Fig. 1, D andE). Every postsource decay product of the 2498-Da peptide corresponded to the predicted sequence of the EST, thus confirming the match (Fig. 1 E). To annotate the EST, the position-specific iterated basic local alignment search tool was used to search for similar proteins. The search results showed that the C termini of members of the CD36 family had the highest scores, and t103 was therefore designated DdCD36. The identities of gp80, actin, porin, and comitin were confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig.1 F). Since proteins anchored to the plasma membrane via a lipid moiety are known to be associated with TIFF (7Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8047) Google Scholar), we labeled cells metabolically with [3H]palmitic acid and determined whether labeled proteins were enriched in the TIFF fraction. Labeled cells were fractionated into three parts: the Triton X-100-soluble fraction, the Triton X-100-insoluble pelleted fraction after floatation centrifugation, and TIFF. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and compared after fluorography (Fig.2). TIFF was enriched with many palmitoylated proteins. Several intensely labeled species displayed gel mobilities corresponding to gp80, t46, actin, RMLC, and t18, suggesting that these proteins or some co-migrating species were heavily palmitoylated. Since membrane insolubility in cold Triton X-100 is a characteristic of liquid-ordered membrane structure (1Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar, 2Brown D.A. London E. J. Memb. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 3Hooper N.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), we expected Dictyostelium TIFF to be enriched in lipids conforming to this structure. Total lipids in plasma membranes and TIFF were analyzed and compared (TableI). TIFF contained a 15-fold higher sterol level and a 1.5-fold higher phospholipid level than the plasma membrane. The elevated lipid/protein ratios in TIFF probably accounted for its low density (1.13–1.14 g/ml). The sterol/phospholipid ratio in TIFF was ∼10-fold higher than that of plasma membranes. The sterol species in TIFF were identified to be stigmasterol (78%), campesterol (14%), and sitosterol (8%) based on column retention times. The stigmasterol species was probably Δ22-stigmasten-3β-ol because it accounts for 88% of the sterols in Dictyosteliumcells (55Murray B.A. Loomis W. The Development of Dictyostelium discoideum. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982: 71-104Crossref Google Scholar). Both TIFF and plasma membranes had similar sterol compositions.Table ILipid compositions of Dictyostelium plasma membranes and TIFFSterolsPhospholipidsSterols/Phospholipidsmg/mg proteinmg/mg proteinmg/mgmol/molPlasma membrane0.236 ± 0.029 (1.0)0.350 ± 0.055 (1.0)0.678 ± 0.038 (1.0)1.26 ± 0.071 (1.0)TIFF3.620 ± 0.593 (15.3)0.541 ± 0.072 (1.55)6.750 ± 1.15 (9.96)12.5 ± 2.13 (9.92)The values represent the means ± S.D.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)1 class I molecules present peptides to CD8+ T cells, which recognize this complex by their T cell receptor. Such CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) detect cells infected with viruses or intracellular bacteria and consequently destroy these infected cells by cytotoxic effector mechanisms (1Zinkernagel R.M.

Nature. 1990; 348: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). MHC class I molecules are assembled by combining the α-chain and the β2-microglobulin in association with a peptide derived from cytoplasmic proteins after proteolytic cleavage by proteosomes (5Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1992; 357: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides are transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum with the help of a heterodimeric transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) (6Spies T. Cerundolo V. Colonna M. Cresswell P. Townsend A. DeMars R. Nature. 1992; 355: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 7Shepherd J.C. Schumacher T.N. Ashton-Rickardt P.G. Imaeda S. Ploegh H.L. Janeway Jr., C.A. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1993; 74: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The α-chain, β2-microglobulin, and peptide are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the mature MHC class I molecule migrates through the Golgi to reach the cell surface. Most of the allelic polymorphism of the α-chain is confined to the α1-α2 domains, which form a membrane-distal groove, and specific binding is defined by key amino acids within the peptide, referred as anchor residues (reviewed in Ref. 8Rammensee H.G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In contrast to humans and mice, in the laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) the function of CD8+ T cells is poorly understood, and only a few experimental models of intracellular infectious agents are available to analyze T cell functions. The rat expresses two different types of MHC class I molecules, a classical class Ia, which is responsible for conventional antigen presentation to CTLs, and nonclassical class Ib molecules with unconventional or undefined functions (9Rada C. Lorenzi R. Powis S.J. van den Bogaerde J. Parham P. Howard J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2167-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 10Joly E. Leong L. Coadwell W.J. Clarkson C. Butcher G.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1551-1558PubMed Google Scholar). The RT1.A region of the rat MHC encodes for the class Ia molecules, whereas different RT1 regions encode the nonclassical class Ib molecules (11Jameson S.C. Tope W.D. Tredgett E.M. Windle J.M. Diamond A.G. Howard J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Leong L.Y. Le Rolle A.F. Deverson E.V. Powis S.J. Larkins A.P. Vaage J.T. Stokland A. Lambracht-Washington D. Rolstad B. Joly E. Butcher G.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 743-752PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in rats, unlike humans or mice, two functionally allelic forms of the TAP exist, which are called TAP-A and TAP-B. These molecules can be distinguished by their different peptide transport specificities. In the Lewis rat, RT1.Al molecules are linked to TAP-A (reviewed in Ref. 13Joly E. Butcher G.W. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the motifs of only two TAP-A-associated molecules, RT1.Al and RT1.Aa, have been determined (14Powis S.J. Young L.L. Barker P.J. Richardson L. Howard J.C. Butcher G.W. Transplant. Proc. 1993; 25: 2752-2753PubMed Google Scholar, 15Reizis B. Schild H. Stefanovic S. Mor F. Rammensee H. Cohen I.R.

Thus far, only peptides from naturally processed self-proteins are known to bind to RT1.Al and RT1.Aa molecules, whereas no information on peptides associated with class I molecules from intracellular bacteria or viruses exists. One of the few experimental infectious models in rats is Borna disease, caused by Borna disease virus (BDV), a noncytolytic single-stranded RNA virus, belonging to the order of Mononegavirales. BDV-induced Borna disease is an encephalomyelitis originally described in horses and sheep (17Ludwig H. Thein P. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1977; 163: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Rott R. Becht H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 190: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In recent years, this viral infection of the central nervous system has been diagnosed in a wide variety of animals including cattle, cats, dogs, and birds (reviewed in Ref. 19Stitz L. Rott R. Granoff A. Webster R.G. Encyclopedia of Virology. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1999: 167-173Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, Borna disease virus, its nucleic acid, and specific antibodies were detected in the blood of patients with psychiatric diseases (20Bode L. Zimmermann W. Ferszt R. Steinbach F. Ludwig H.

Res. 1997; 23: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence whether BDV represents the causative agent for any human disorder. The best investigated animal model for the pathogenesis of BDV infection is the Lewis rat. After intracerebral infection, the animals develop an encephalomyelitis in which the infiltrating cells have been characterized as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages (26Deschl U. Stitz L. Herzog S. Frese K. Rott R. Acta Neuropathol. 1990; 81: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Stitz L. Bilzer T. Richt J.A. Rott R. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 1993; 7: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). BDV-specific CD8+ T cells represent the effector cell population during the acute phase of the disease and significantly contribute to the destruction of virus-infected brain cells in vivo. Moreover, evidence has been presented that this T cell population also participates in the degenerative encephalopathy resulting in a severe cortical brain atrophy in the chronic phase of the disease (28Planz O. Bilzer T. Sobbe M. Stitz L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Stitz L. Planz O. Bilzer T. Frei K. Fontana A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3581-3586PubMed Google Scholar, 30Planz O. Bilzer T. Stitz L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 896-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides their role in immunopathology, however, BDV-specific CD8+ T cells were also known to eliminate the virus, without causing disease. BDV-specific CD4+ T cells given prior to infection induce CD8+ T cells, which eliminate the virus without causing significant cell damage (31Noske K. Bilzer T. Planz O. Stitz L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4387-4395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleoprotein (p40) and phosphoprotein (p24) of the virus are most abundantly synthesized during BDV infection and represent the main targets for the immune system. Recently, we have shown that the nucleoprotein is a major target for CTL in the Lewis rat model (32Planz O. Stitz L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1715-1718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the characterization and quantification of a naturally processed RT1.Al ligand from the nucleoprotein of BDV. This peptide is recognized by classical CD8+ T cells. The Giessen strain He/80 of BDV was used for this study (33Narayan O. Herzog S. Frese K. Scheefers H. Rott R. J. Infect. Dis. 1983; 148: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Female Lewis rats were purchased from the central breeding facilities of the Federal Research Center for Viral Diseases of Animals in Tübingen. At an age of 5 weeks the animals were infected intracerebrally in the left brain hemisphere with 0.05 ml of BDV corresponding to 5 × 103 focus-forming units. Skin cell cultures were obtained from 2-week-old Lewis (LEW), Brown Norway (BN), and Louvain (LOU) rats and cultured for more than 8 years in our laboratory (28Planz O. Bilzer T. Sobbe M. Stitz L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). F10 (Lewis astrocytes) cells were originally obtained from Dr. H. Wekerle, Munich. OX 18 hybridoma cells, secreting antibodies directed against RT1.A were purchased from ATCC and cultured in our laboratory. In addition, LEW and F10 cells were persistently infected with BDV (BDV-LEW and BDV-F10), and persistent infection was controlled on a routine basis by immunofluorescence or fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. For peptide elution BDV-LEW or BDV-F10 cells were cultured in a spin bottle system using Cultisphere™ microcarrier (Integra, Fernwald, Germany). This system allowed the production of 1–2 × 109 cells/liter. OX18 monoclonal antibody was produced in 350-ml CELLINE™ flasks (Integra, Fernwald, Germany). Lymphocytes from the brains of BDV-infected rats were isolated by a method previously described (34Irani D.N. Griffin D.E. J. Immunol.

Med. 1993; 178: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Twenty days after BDV infection rats were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride and perfused with balanced salt solution. The brain tissue was carefully homogenized through a stainless steel mesh and collected in balanced salt solution containing collagenase D (0.05%), trypsin inhibitor (TLCK; 0.1 μg/ml), DNase I (10 μg/ml), and HEPES (10 mm). The cell suspension was stirred at room temperature for 1 h and allowed to settle for 30 min. The supernatant was pelleted at 200 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of calcium-magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline. Five ml of the suspension were layered on top of 10 ml of a modified RPMI medium-Ficoll gradient and centrifuged at 500 × g for 30 min. The pellet containing the lymphocytes was resuspended in IMDM with 5% rat serum and 5% ConA supernatant and cultured overnight. The next day, cells were counted for further use. Effector T cells were used in a concentration of 3 × 106 cells/ml or 106 cells/ml IMDM, 2% fetal calf serum. Persistently BDV-infected LEW (BDV-LEW) were labeled with 0.2 mCi of 51Cr at 37 °C for 1 h, washed three times with balanced salt solution, and used as target cells. Dried HPLC peptide fractions were resuspended in a standard volume of 150 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. For titration, 50 μl of each fraction either undiluted or diluted 1:10 or 1:100 were used to pulse 104 uninfected LEW cells in 50 μl of IMDM, 2% fetal calf serum for 90 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, 100 μl of effector cells (effector to target ratio of 30:1 or 10:1) were added and incubated for 10 h at 37 °C. Synthetic peptides were dissolved in Me2SO in a concentration of 1 mg/ml. For peptide titration, either 5 or 1 μl of the different peptides and 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions in a volume of 50 μl of IMDM, 2% fetal calf serum were used to pulse 104 LEW cells in 50 μl of IMDM, 2% fetal calf serum for 90 min at 37 °C. Effector cells were used as described above. For effector cell titration, the standard peptide ASYAQMTTY was used in a concentration of 20 nm. 2.5 × 1010virus-infected and uninfected LEW or F10 cells were resuspended in 200 ml of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm CHAPS, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and disrupted using a handheld glass homogenizer and sonication. The suspensions were stirred at 4 °C for 1 h before centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were spun in an ultracentrifuge at 40,000 rpm for 1 h and passed through prefilters before loading onto glycine-coupled cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B columns as a preclearing step. The MHC I molecules were then purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using monoclonal antibody OX18 coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B. After elution of the RT1.Al complexes using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2), the eluted material was filtered through a Centricon 10 and concentrated to 0.5 ml by vacuum centrifugation. Peptide separations were carried out on a reversed-phase prepacked column (C2/C18, 2.1 × 100 mm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech SMART system. Samples were injected in a volume of 500 μl. The following elution procedure was used: solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O; solvent B, 0.081% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile; 0–10 min, 10% B; 10–25 min, linear increase to 20% B; 25–45 min, 1%/min increase to 40% B; 45–55 min, 2%/min increase to 60% B; 55–60 min, linear increase to 75% B; and 60–65 min, constant 75% B. The flow rate was 150 μl/min. Fractions were collected by time fractionation (1–10 min, 450 μl/min; 10–65 min, 150 μl/min), and elution was monitored by measuring UV light absorption at 214 nm in a continuous flow detector. Acetonitrile was removed from eluted material by vacuum centrifugation before samples were made up to a standard volume of 150 μl using phosphate-buffered saline and stored at −80 °C. For the coelution experiments, 1 μg of synthetic ASYAQMTTY diluted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was injected in a total volume of 500 μl and separated using the same conditions as described above. Potential RT1.Al-presented peptides were selected by epitope prediction as described (35Rammensee H. Bachmann J. Emmerich N.P. Bachor O.A. Stevanovic S. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). Briefly, nonamer peptides from the sequence of p40 (Swiss-Prot accession number Q01552) and other Borna disease virus proteins were selected using a matrix pattern suitable for the calculation of peptides fitting to the RT1.Al peptide motif. The peptide motif and epitope predictions are available on our web page, where additional information can be obtained. Peptides were synthesized in an automated peptide synthesizer 432A (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) following the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/tBu strategy. After removal from the resin by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid/phenol/ethanedithiol/thioanisole/water (90:3.75:1.25:2.5:2.5 by volume) for 1 h or 3 h (arginine-containing peptides), peptides were precipitated from methyl tert-butyl ether, washed once with methyl tert-butyl ether and twice with diethyl ether, and resuspended in water prior to lyophilization. Synthesis products were analyzed by HPLC (Varian Star, Darmstadt, Germany) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (see below). Peptides of less than 80% purity were purified by preparative HPLC. For MALDI-TOF MS 0.5 μl of sample was mixed with 0.5 μl of dihydroxyacetophenone matrix (20 mg of 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone, 5 mg of ammonium citrate in 1 ml of 80% 2-propanol) on a gold target and analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard G2025A instrument (Hewlett-Packard, Waldbronn, Germany) at a vacuum of 10−6 torr (1 torr = 133 pascals). For signal generation, 50–150 laser shots were added up in the single shot mode. Nanocapillary HPLC-MS and MSMS of synthetic and naturally processed peptides were done as described (36Schirle M. Keilholz W. Weber B. Gouttefangeas C. Dumrese T. Becker H.D. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2216-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) by coupling a reversed-phase HPLC system (ABI 140D, Applied Biosystems) to a hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time of flight tandem mass spectrometer (Q-TOF, Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) equipped with an electron spray ionization source. As a modification of the described setup, loading of typical sample volumes of 100 μl was achieved by preconcentration on a 300-μm × 5-mm C18μ-precolumn (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA). A syringe pump (PHD 2000, Harvard Apparatus Inc., Holliston, MA), equipped with a gas-tight 100-μl syringe (1710 RNR, Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland), was used to deliver solvent and sample at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. A blank run was performed prior to any HPLC-MS run to ensure that the system was free of any residual synthetic peptide. For nanocapillary HPLC-MSMS experiments, fragmentation of the parent ion was achieved at the given retention time by collision with argon atoms. Q1 was set to the mass of interest ± 0.5 Da, and an optimized collision energy was applied. Fragmentation was completed after 60 s. Peptide motifs and anchor residues of the RT1.Al molecule have been published previously (15Reizis B. Schild H. Stefanovic S. Mor F. Rammensee H. Cohen I.R. Immunogenetics. 1997; 45: 278-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, the five entries of Borna disease virus proteins contained in the Swiss Protein Database, release 39 (nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix protein, glycoprotein, and the L-polymerase of BDV), were screened for RT1.Al motifs using the data base SYFPEITHI. Peptides optimal for presentation by RT1.Al are nonamers carrying Phe or Tyr in position 3 and large hydrophobic residues in position 9. According to this prediction, several sequences were synthesized from each viral protein (TableI). Fibroblast cells from the Lewis rat (LEW, RT1.Al) were loaded with peptides because no TAP-deficient cell lines are available that express the RT1.Al class I molecule.Table IRecognition of synthetic peptides by BDV-specific CD8+ T cells1-a Position is the amino acid position of the respective protein.1-b Peptide concentration was 1 mg/ml.1-c Effector:target ratio was 30:1; numbers indicate lysis with 5-μg/0.5-μg/50-ng peptide to label the target cells. 1-a Position is the amino acid position of the respective protein. 1-b Peptide concentration was 1 mg/ml. 1-c Effector:target ratio was 30:1; numbers indicate lysis with 5-μg/0.5-μg/50-ng peptide to label the target cells. To test whether the predicted peptides are recognized by BDV-specific CD8+ T cells, Lewis rats were infected by the intracerebral route, and 19 days later lymphocytes were isolated from the brain. As shown in Table I, these T cells recognized only 1 of the 16 predicted peptides when pulsed on LEW cells. The sequence ASYAQMTTY is located within the nucleoprotein of BDV. After loading LEW cells with different concentrations of peptide, a cytotoxicity assay using BDV-specific T cells as effector cells was performed. As shown in Fig.1A, the titration experiment indicated the highest specific cell lysis with 5 ng of peptide; half-maximal recognition was observed with 50 pg of peptide. When the amino acid tyrosine at position 9 was changed to a glycine, the peptide was still recognized to a lower extent (Fig. 1B), whereas after replacement of the tyrosine at position 3 by a glycine, cell lysis was only observed with the highest peptide concentration (Fig. 1C). The RT1.Al restriction of BDV-specific T cells was demonstrated by loading fibroblast cell lines from the Brown Norway rat (RT1.An) and from the Louvain rat (RT1.Au) with peptide and using them as target cells. As shown in TableII, BDV-specific T cells are unable to recognize peptide-labeled BN or LOU cells, whereas peptide-loaded LEW cells as well as infected cells were killed. In addition, T cells from BDV-infected rats were unable to kill YAC cells, demonstrating the absence of NK cell activity (Table II). These results indicate that the synthetic peptide ASYAQMTTY is recognized in combination with the RT1.Al class I molecule by BDV-specific T cells from the Lewis rat.Table IIMHC restriction of the BDV-specific peptide ASYAQMTTYTarget cellsPercent specific lysis2-aEffector:target ratio, 10:1/3:1/1:1.BDV-LEW(RT1.A1)50/20/3LEW-peptide(RT1.A1)60/26/12BN-peptide(RT1.An)0/0/0LOU-peptide(RT1.Au)0/0/0YAC3/0/02-a Effector:target ratio, 10:1/3:1/1:1. Open table in a new tab Persistently BDV-infected LEW cells (2.5 × 1010) were lysed, and the RT1.Al complexes were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the MHC class I-specific monoclonal antibody OX18. The peptides were eluted from the RT1.Al complexes and fractionated by HPLC. In control experiments, RT1.Al-bound peptides from uninfected LEW cells were eluted (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Thereafter, uninfected LEW cells were incubated with aliquots of the different HPLC fractions and were tested for recognition by BDV-specific T cells. Significant BDV-specific lysis was found with the HPLC fraction 24 and to a lower extent with fraction 23 (Table III, Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained when RT1.Al molecules from 2.5 × 1010 persistently BDV-infected F10 cells were immmunoprecipitated and fractionated by HPLC (data not shown). As a control, LEW cells were incubated with HPLC fractions 23 and 24 of the peptide mixture eluted from a column that contained glycine instead of the monoclonal antibody OX18. No lysis of target cells was observed, indicating that HPLC fractions 23 and 24 of persistently BDV-infected LEW cells contained peptides that are recognized by BDV-specific T cells (Table III). Furthermore, no specific lysis was found when target cells were incubated with HPLC fractions of RT1.Almolecules from 2.5 × 1010 uninfected LEW or F10 cells (data not shown).Table IIIRecognition of HPLC fractions by BDV-specific T cellsHPLC fractionPercent specific lysis3-aEffector:target ratio was 30:1; numbers indicate lysis with 50-μl/5-μl/0.5-μl peptide fraction in a volume of 50 μl to label the target cells.BDV-LEW OX18Fraction 2450/17/0BDV-LEW glycineFraction 247/3/3BDV-LEW OX18Fraction 2322/7/7BDV-LEW glycineFraction 230/4/2ASYAQMTTYFraction 2479/59/50ASYAQMTTYFraction 2372/53/153-a Effector:target ratio was 30:1; numbers indicate lysis with 50-μl/5-μl/0.5-μl peptide fraction in a volume of 50 μl to label the target cells. Open table in a new tab One μg of the synthetic peptide ASYAQMTTY was analyzed by HPLC using identical conditions as for the separation of RT1.Al ligands from BDV-LEW. As shown in Fig.2A, an intense UV signal is visible in the HPLC profile at fraction 24. Additional peaks, particularly in fractions 13, 28, and 47, result from medium contents, because the peptide had been dissolved in IMDM before it was diluted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fraction 24 and fraction 23 were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Only one m/z signal corresponding to the molecular mass of ASYAQMTTY (MH+ 1035) was detected, indicating that ASYAQMTTY coeluted with the naturally processed peptide recognized by BDV-specific T cells (data not shown). Furthermore, when fractions 23 and 24 were used to label target cells, these cells were lysed by BDV-specific T cells (Table III). Dilution experiments indicated that the majority of ASYAQMTTY peptide eluted in fraction 24. Moreover, Table III suggests that in fraction 24 of the BDV-LEW, the OX18 HPLC run contained less copies of the peptide than the respective fraction of the HPLC run performed with the synthetic peptide. Although CTL recognition after coelution experiments indicated the presence of ASYAQMTTY in fraction 24 of the RT1.Al ligand separation from infected LEW, the amino acid sequence of this naturally processed peptide was confirmed by nanocapillary liquid chromatography-MSMS analysis (Fig.3). Comparison of liquid chromatography-MS signal intensities of the naturally processed peptide and 2 pmol of coeluting synthetic peptide indicated that a total of 3.7 pmol of naturally processed ASYAQMTTY had been isolated from 2.5 × 1010 BDV-infected LEW cells (data not shown). This corresponds to ∼350 copies/cell, assuming an overall yield of 25% after peptide extraction and HPLC (36Schirle M. Keilholz W. Weber B. Gouttefangeas C. Dumrese T. Becker H.D. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2216-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the present communication, we identified and characterized the first rat MHC class I ligand derived from an infectious agent and recognized by CD8+ T cells. The peptide was isolated from BDV-infected cells upon MHC immunoprecipitation and purified by HPLC. The peptide is recognized by BDV-specific T cells. Furthermore, following peptide prediction, a synthetic peptide is recognized in combination with the RT1.Al class I molecule of the Lewis rat by BDV-specific T cells. Replacing an amino acid either in position 3 or position 9 results in clearly lower lytic activity, where position 3 seemed to be more decisive for an efficient binding of the peptide to MHC class I than did position 9. The peptide is located within the nucleoprotein (p40) of the virus. After HPLC fractionation of the synthetic peptide ASYAQMTTY, we found that this synthetic peptide coelutes with the naturally processed peptide recognized by BDV-specific T cells. Amino acid sequence by nanocapillary HPLC-MSMS analysis confirmed that ASYAQMTTY is also a naturally processed peptide. Furthermore, after quantification of the peptide, we were able to show that ∼350 copies of this peptide are complexed with MHC class I molecules on the surface of a BDV-infected cell. The knowledge of antigen processing and presentation in rats is fragmentary compared with what is known in humans and mice. For the laboratory rat (R. norvegicus) only the peptide motifs of RT1.Al, RT1.Au, RT1.Ac, and RT1.Aa are known, showing a restricted preference for peptides of 9–12 amino acids (14Powis S.J. Young L.L. Barker P.J. Richardson L. Howard J.C. Butcher G.W. Transplant. Proc. 1993; 25: 2752-2753PubMed Google Scholar, 15Reizis B. Schild H. Stefanovic S. Mor F. Rammensee H. Cohen I.R. Immunogenetics. 1997; 45: 278-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Powis S.J. Young L.L. Joly E. Barker P.J. Richardson L. Brandt R.P. Melief C.J. Howard J.C. Butcher G.W.

Immunol. 1998; 28: 1272-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This is similar to preferences of MHC class I molecules in humans and mice. Nevertheless, there are differences in antigen processing and presentation of rats compared with humans and mice. The rat, as a unique feature, has two functionally distinct allelic forms of TAP, TAP-A and TAP-B, which have different peptide transport specificities (13Joly E. Butcher G.W. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Peptides used in the present study that were presented by RT1.Al are known to be linked to TAP-A, which efficiently transports peptides with aromatic C termini (38Heemels M.T. Schumacher T.N. Wonigeit K. Ploegh H.L. Science. 1993; 262: 2059-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 39Heemels M.T. Ploegh H.L. Immunity. 1994; 1: 775-784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because RT1.Al does not have an acidic F pocket, the peptide ASYAQMTTY, probably transported by TAP-A, fits perfectly into the RT1.Al class I molecule. Although some information about naturally processed self- or allo-peptides from the rat exists, no ligand from viruses or intracellular bacteria has been reported so far. Recently, Stevens et al. (40Stevens J. Jones R.C. Bordoli R.S. Trowsdale J. Gaskell S.J. Butcher G.W. Joly E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 38: 29217-29224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (17) Google Scholar) described the first RT1.Ac class I allogenic NK ligand after designing synthetic peptides based on the published binding motif for RT1.Ac and the identification of naturally presented peptides by RT1.Al on rat splenocytes. The present article describes the first classical CTL epitope encoded by a virus. Borna disease virus is found in a wide variety of mammals including man (reviewed in Ref. 19Stitz L. Rott R. Granoff A. Webster R.G. Encyclopedia of Virology. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1999: 167-173Crossref Google Scholar). The best investigated experimental model of Borna disease, a virus-induced immune-mediated encephalomyelitis, is the infection of the Lewis rat. The knowledge of a defined CTL epitope of BDV will help to further characterize the immunopathological mechanisms in more detail. An earlier study showed that only target cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia-BDVp40 construct were recognized by BDV-specific CTL, whereas target cells infected with vaccinia virus carrying the phosphoprotein, the matrix protein, or the glycoprotein were not recognized (32Planz O. Stitz L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1715-1718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the peptide ASYAQMTTY is recognized by CTL most efficiently, one might assume that this peptide represents an immunodominant trait. However, we cannot exclude the existence of other, subdominant, nucleoprotein-specific CTL epitopes. Because no NK cell activity was found in brain lymphocyte preparations, NK-specific killing directed against the peptide ASYAQMTTY can be excluded. This finding is supported by an earlier report in which CD8+ T cell-mediated, MHC class I-restricted lysis of BDV-infected target cells, but no killing of NK-sensitive YAC cells, was found (28Planz O. Bilzer T. Sobbe M. Stitz L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The quantification of the natural RT1.Al ligand ASYAQMTTY from persistently BDV-infected cells showed that ∼350 copies/cell were present. This copy number is similar to those reported from other viral epitopes associated with MHC class I molecules from humans and mice (41Stevanovic S. Schild H. Semin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In persistently BDV-infected cells, only a very few infectious viral particles can be found (42Duchala C.S. Carbone K.M. Narayan O. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 3507-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 43Briese T. de la Torre J.C. Lewis A. Ludwig H. Lipkin W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11486-11489Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Because BDV is a negative-stranded RNA virus, one might speculate that high copy numbers of p40 are required for RNA stabilization and consequently virus replication. Therefore, our data provide additional information for the biology of BDV and a better understanding of the poorly understood mechanism of replication. MHC-restricted cytotoxic T cells recognize virus-specific peptides in combination with MHC class I. This can take place relatively early after infection in the absence of an infectious virus (44Zinkernagel R.M. Doherty P.C. Adv. Immunol. 1979; 27: 51-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that translation of RNA by ribosomes into protein can result in defective ribosomal products, leading to an early recognition of the virus-infected cell by the immune system, whereas the foreign proteins are still being produced (45Schubert U. Anton L.C. Gibbs J. Norbury C.C. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 46Reits E.A. Vos J.C. Gromme M. Neefjes J. Nature. 2000; 404: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). These findings support the earlier investigations by Zinkernagel and Doherty (1Zinkernagel R.M. Doherty P.C. Nature. 1974; 248: 701-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 44Zinkernagel R.M. Doherty P.C. Adv. Immunol. 1979; 27: 51-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar) and also suggest that the numbers of copies found for a peptide must not correlate with the amount of protein made and needed for virus replication. On the other hand, because the gene encoding for the nucleoprotein is located at the 3′ end of the antigenome (open reading frame I), and therefore viral transcription and translation of this protein occur very early, the nucleoprotein is a good candidate for an early immunodominant CTL response of the host against BDV. This hypothesis is supported by the findings that p40 is the first BDV-specific protein detectable in infected cells and tissue and that BDV-specific CD8+ T cells are directed against the nucleoprotein (32Planz O. Stitz L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1715-1718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Haas B. Becht H. Rott R. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). During the last 15 years BDV was repeatedly found in patients with psychiatric disorders (20Bode L. Zimmermann W. Ferszt R. Steinbach F. Ludwig H. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Planz O. Rentzsch C. Batra A. Rziha H.-J. Stitz L.

Psychiatry. 1985; 42: 1093-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is not clear if BDV is the causative agent of these disorders or if it is simply a secondary infection. Antibodies in humans were found to be predominantly directed against the nucleoprotein, the phosphoprotein, and the matrix protein (25Waltrip R.W., II Buchanan R.W. Carpenter Jr., W.T. Kirkpatrick B.

The role of the cellular immune response against BDV in man is still unknown. With our data obtained in the BDV model system and with the help of epitope prediction and transgenic mouse models, one might be able to define BDV-specific HLA-restricted CTL epitopes to investigate a possible CTL response in man.

https://openalex.org/W2005218382,"Pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PTL) requires colipase for activity. Various constituents in meals and in bile, particularly bile acids, inhibit PTL. Colipase restores activity to lipase in the presence of inhibitory substances like bile acids. Presumably, colipase functions by anchoring and orienting PTL at the oil-water interface. The x-ray structure of the colipase·PTL complex supports this model. In the x-ray structure, colipase has a hydrophobic surface positioned to bind substrate and a hydrophilic surface, lying opposite the hydrophobic surface, with two putative lipase-binding domains, Glu45/Asp89 and Glu64/Arg65. To determine whether the hydrophilic surface interacts with PTL in solution, we introduced mutations into the putative PTL binding domains of human colipase. Each mutant was expressed, purified, and assessed for activity against various substrates. Most of the mutants showed impaired ability to reactivate PTL, with mutations in the Glu64/Arg65 binding site causing the greatest effect. Analysis indicated that the mutations decreased the affinity of the colipase mutants for PTL and prevented the formation of PTL·colipase complexes. The impaired function of the mutants was most apparent when assayed in micellar bile salt solutions. Most mutants stimulated PTL activity normally in monomeric bile salt solutions. We also tested the mutants for their ability to bind substrate and anchor lipase to tributyrin. Even though the ability of the mutants to anchor PTL to an interface decreased in proportion to their activity, each mutant colipase bound to tributyrin to the same extent as wild type colipase. These results demonstrate that the hydrophilic surface of colipase interacts with PTL in solution to form active colipase·PTL complexes, that bile salt micelles influence that binding, and that the proper interaction of colipase with PTL requires the Glu64/Arg65 binding site.

We also tested the mutants for their ability to bind substrate and anchor lipase to tributyrin. Even though the ability of the mutants to anchor PTL to an interface decreased in proportion to their activity, each mutant colipase bound to tributyrin to the same extent as wild type colipase. These results demonstrate that the hydrophilic surface of colipase interacts with PTL in solution to form active colipase·PTL complexes, that bile salt micelles influence that binding, and that the proper interaction of colipase with PTL requires the Glu64/Arg65 binding site. Lipases participate in a variety of physiologic and industrial processes (1Carey M.C. Hernell O. Semin. Gastrointest. Dis. 1992; 3: 189-208Google Scholar, 2Verger R. Borgstrom B. Brockman H.L. Lipases. Elsevier, Amsterdam1984: 84-150Google Scholar). They aid in the preparation of foods and pharmaceuticals. They serve to generate second messengers, participate in cytotoxicity reactions, and have become a model system for the study of molecular interactions occurring at lipid-water interfaces. Most importantly, they allow for the digestion and trafficking of dietary triglycerides and phospholipids by converting apolar dietary lipids to more polar products, fatty acids and monoacylglycerols. An understanding of the digestive process has implications for the treatment of human diseases, including malnutrition and obesity.The digestion of dietary triglyceride begins in the stomach through the process of emulsification and the actions of gastric lipase (3Carriere F. Barrowman J.A. Verger R. Laugier R. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 876-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Digestion continues in the duodenum where pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PTL) 1The abbreviations used are:PTLpancreatic triglyceride lipaseCMCcritical micelle concentrationTBSTTris-buffered saline with Tween 20TDCtaurodeoxycholateBSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis releases 50–70% of dietary fatty acids (3Carriere F. Barrowman J.A. Verger R. Laugier R. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 876-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Although PTL requires bile acids to function efficiently, bile acid micelles inhibit PTL unless another pancreatic protein, colipase, is present (2Verger R. Borgstrom B. Brockman H.L. Lipases. Elsevier, Amsterdam1984: 84-150Google Scholar). Colipase restores PTL activity in the presence of physiologic concentrations of bile acids. Without colipase, PTL could not cleave fatty acids from dietary triglycerides, and fat malabsorption with its consequences would result.Previous models of colipase function uniformly proposed that colipase acts as a bridge between PTL and the lipid substrate by binding to both PTL and the lipid emulsion surface. The strongest support for this model comes from the crystal structures of the porcine colipase·human PTL complex solved under different conditions (4van Tilbeurgh H. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1992; 359: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 5zvan Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In the first structure, PTL resides in an inactive conformation with the catalytic site sterically blocked by a surface loop, called the lid. The other structure, solved in the presence of mixed micelles, reveals the active conformation of PTL in which the lid moves away from the catalytic site and forms new interactions with colipase. Colipase has similar conformations in both structures (6Egloff M.P. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Importantly, colipase has two opposing surfaces that can potentially anchor PTL to the substrate. One surface, which contains predominantly hydrophilic residues, forms interactions with the C-terminal domain of PTL. The opposite surface, which faces away from PTL, has four hydrophobic loops positioned to interact with the substrate surface. In this conformation, colipase brings PTL into the proper proximity and orientation for lipid hydrolysis.The crystal structure predicts that van der Waals forces and several polar bonds stabilize the interaction between colipase and PTL. The number of putative polar bonds varies between the inactive and active conformation of PTL. In the active conformation of PTL two colipase residues, Glu15 and Arg38, form polar bonds with residues in the PTL lid. In both conformations of PTL polar interactions occur between five residues of colipase, Arg44, Glu45, Glu64, Arg65, and Asn89, and main-chain residues in the C-terminal domain of PTL. Four residues form two potential binding domains, one containing residues 45 and 89, which interact with Lys400 of PTL, and the other containing residues 64 and 65, which interact with Gln369 of PTL. Arg44 is not conserved and is replaced by a serine or methionine in most other species. Additionally, Arg44 does not form a polar bond in the porcine colipase·PTL complex. These points argue that Arg44 may not play an important role in colipase·PTL interactions in solution.A few studies have examined the role of specific amino acids in the formation of the colipase·PTL complex. One study examined the interaction between Glu15 of colipase and the PTL lid by site-specific mutagenesis of Glu15 (7Lowe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This study concluded that the interactions between Glu15 and the PTL lid stabilized the active confirmation of PTL. Two other studies investigated the interaction between colipase and the C-terminal domain of PTL. Jennens and Lowe (8Jennens M.L. Lowe M.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1029-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) introduced substitution and deletion mutations into the C-terminal domain of PTL. Single substitution mutations of multiple PTL residues thought to interact with colipase did not affect lipase activity. Deletion of the C-terminal domain greatly decreased PTL activity, but the truncated PTL still required colipase for activity in the presence of bile acids. These mutants raised questions about the importance of the interactions between colipase and the C-terminal domain of PTL. Another recent study provided support for the predicted interaction between one colipase residue, Glu45, and Lys400 of the PTL C-terminal domain (9Ayvazian L. Crenon I. Hermosos J. Pignol D. Chapus C. Kerfelec B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33604-33609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Ayvazian et al. (9Ayvazian L. Crenon I. Hermosos J. Pignol D. Chapus C. Kerfelec B. J. Biol.

None of these studies addressed the relative importance of the other putative lipase binding residues in the hydrophilic surface of colipase.To determine if the hydrophilic surface of colipase interacts with lipase in solution and to identify participating residues, we introduced mutations into positions 44, 45, 64, 65, and 89 of human colipase by site-specific mutagenesis. Each mutant colipase was characterized for the ability to reactivate PTL in the presence of bile salts and to anchor PTL at an oil-water interface. The results support the orientation of colipase as defined by the crystal structures. That is, the hydrophilic surface of colipase interacts with PTL in solution. Furthermore, the results identify the 64/65 binding domain, specifically position 64, as key to the normal function of colipase, thereby adding additional details to the mechanism of PTL-mediated lipolysis.DISCUSSIONIn the crystal structure of porcine colipase bound to PTL, polar interactions form between colipase residues Glu45, Asn89 (Asp89 in human colipase), Glu64, and Arg65 and residues in the C-terminal domain of PTL (6Egloff M.P. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We mutated each putative lipase-binding residue of colipase to determine whether these amino acids participate in complex formation when the proteins are in solution. Characterization of the colipase mutants showed that substitutions in each targeted site decreased the ability of colipase to bind PTL in the presence of bile salt micelles. Several conclusions can be made from these results. First, residues in the hydrophilic surface of colipase mediate the formation of colipase·PTL complexes in solution as predicted by the crystal structure. Second, bile salt micelles influence the assembly of productive colipase·PTL complexes. Third, both the Glu45/Asp89 and Glu64/Arg65 binding domains contribute to complex formation, but the Glu64/Arg65 binding site predominates. Although the Glu45/Asp89sites tolerated alanine substitutions, any changes, with the exception of a conserved mutation at position 65, in the Glu64/Arg65 binding site greatly diminished the activity of these colipase mutants when assayed above the CMC of TDC.The increased sensitivity of the Glu64/Arg65site compared with the Glu45/Asp89 site was not expected, based on the crystal structure of the PTL·colipase complex (6Egloff M.P. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The carboxylate side chain of Glu64 forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain nitrogen of PTL residue Gln369 and serves as a contact point for a water molecule bridge involving Glu45 of colipase and Ser366 of PTL. Arg65 contributes another hydrogen bond with the side chain of Gln369. In contrast, Glu45 forms the only salt bridge with the C-terminal domain of PTL (Lys400), forms a hydrogen bond with Asn366, and contributes to the water bridge noted above. Asp89 has a hydrogen bond with Lys400 of PTL and contributes to a water bridge with Gly66 of colipase and Leu444 of PTL. Additionally, site-specific mutagenesis of Glu45 and Lys400 of PTL suggested that the ion pairing between these two residues was essential for lipolysis (9Ayvazian L. Crenon I. Hermosos J. Pignol D. Chapus C. Kerfelec B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33604-33609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our results question this conclusion. The preserved function of the E45A colipase mutant suggests that the salt bridge between Glu45 of colipase and Lys400 of PTL is not essential or, alternatively, may not form in solution.Regardless of which binding site was mutated, bile salts altered the behavior of most single substitution mutants. The magnitude of the effect depended on the bile salt concentration. At 0.5 mmTDC, when monomers of bile salts spread at the oil-water interface, the affinity of the colipase mutants for PTL was unchanged except for R65E. At higher TDC concentrations, above the CMC, the affinity of the colipase mutants decreased appreciably for all but the E45A and S44A mutants. At least two models can be offered to explain this observation. The first model proposes that colipase and PTL must form a complex with bile salt micelles in aqueous solution before binding to the interface. There is support for this model in the literature. Multiple studies have demonstrated that bile salt micelles bind to colipase and to PTL (15Sari H. Entressangles B. Desnuelle P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Patton J.S. Donner J. Borgstrom B. Biochim. Biophys.

Lipid Res. 1975; 16: 411-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study with small angle neutron scattering found a detergent micelle associated with the PTL·colipase complex indicating that a complex can form between PTL, colipase, and micelles (19Pignol D. Ayvazian L. kerfelec B. Timmins P. Crenon I. Hermosos J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Chapus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4220-4224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).The second model states that colipase and PTL have poor affinity for each other in aqueous solution. In the absence of substrate PTL preferentially binds to bile salt micelles. When a substrate is added, colipase binds to the substrate first. After formation of a complex with substrate, the bound colipase has a higher affinity for PTL than that of the bile salt micelles. PTL then binds to colipase on the substrate surface. Several studies support this model. The concept of a sequential mechanism where colipase binds to the substrate first followed by PTL has been previously proposed and supported by various experiments (2Verger R. Borgstrom B. Brockman H.L. Lipases. Elsevier, Amsterdam1984: 84-150Google Scholar). Other studies using microcalorimetry, two-phase partitioning, and affinity chromatography with immobilized colipase demonstrated that bile salt micelles bind PTL and weaken the binding of colipase to PTL, which may favor the binding of colipase to the substrate surface rather than to complexes of PTL and bile salt micelles (20Patton J.S. Albertsson P.A. Erlanson C. Borgstrom B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4195-4202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Patton J. Andersson L.

In another study, monomeric bile salt solutions allowed the absorption of PTL to an interface, but a micellar bile salt solution completely inhibited PTL binding to an interface (23Lairon D. Nalbone G. Lafont H. Leonardi J. Domingo N. Hauton J.C. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Two kinetic studies suggested that bile salt micelles or multiple bile salts bind to PTL and inhibit absorption of PTL to the substrate-water interface even in the presence of colipase (24Vandermeers A. Vandermeers-Piret M.-C. Rathe J. Christophe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Momsen W.E. Brockman H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 384-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Both models could account for our data. Mutations in the hydrophilic surface of colipase could destabilize the complex of PTL, bile salts and colipase predicted to form by in the first model. This disruption could occur because the colipase mutants have decreased affinity for the PTL·bile salt complex or because the mutants bind to PTL in an incorrect conformation producing an inactive complex. The fact that the colipase mutants have lowered affinity for PTL and can bind to the substrate but not anchor PTL even as an inactive complex argues against the last possibility. The weakened binding affinity of the colipase mutants for PTL is also consistent with the second model. In this instance the decreased affinity of the colipase mutants for PTL allows the bile salt micelles to compete for PTL binding, and thereby inhibit the formation of an active colipase·PTL complex.Although the role of bile salt micelles in the lipolytic mechanism remains unclear, many molecular details of lipolysis have been described in the past decade. X-ray crystallography and site-specific mutagenesis identified the catalytic triad of PTL. The crystal structures of the colipase·PTL complex and the characterization of naturally occurring and designed lipases with mutations in the lid have demonstrated a role for the lid in substrate selectivity, in substrate binding, and interactions with colipase. Monolayer experiments, kinetic analysis, and site-specific mutagenesis have broadened the role of colipase in the lipolytic mechanism. It stabilizes the lid in the open, active conformation and may direct PTL to substrate patches on the surface of dietary emulsions, which contain high concentrations of phospholipids and cholesterol esters. This work extends these observations to better define the crucial interactions between colipase and PTL. An increased understanding of the molecular details of this important physiologic process provides the information needed to rationally modulate PTL activity for therapeutic purposes. Lipases participate in a variety of physiologic and industrial processes (1Carey M.C. Hernell O. Semin. Gastrointest. Dis. 1992; 3: 189-208Google Scholar, 2Verger R. Borgstrom B. Brockman H.L.

Vandermeers-Piret M.-C. Rathe J. Christophe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Momsen W.E. Brockman H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 384-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Both models could account for our data. Mutations in the hydrophilic surface of colipase could destabilize the complex of PTL, bile salts and colipase predicted to form by in the first model. This disruption could occur because the colipase mutants have decreased affinity for the PTL·bile salt complex or because the mutants bind to PTL in an incorrect conformation producing an inactive complex. The fact that the colipase mutants have lowered affinity for PTL and can bind to the substrate but not anchor PTL even as an inactive complex argues against the last possibility. The weakened binding affinity of the colipase mutants for PTL is also consistent with the second model. In this instance the decreased affinity of the colipase mutants for PTL allows the bile salt micelles to compete for PTL binding, and thereby inhibit the formation of an active colipase·PTL complex.Although the role of bile salt micelles in the lipolytic mechanism remains unclear, many molecular details of lipolysis have been described in the past decade. X-ray crystallography and site-specific mutagenesis identified the catalytic triad of PTL. The crystal structures of the colipase·PTL complex and the characterization of naturally occurring and designed lipases with mutations in the lid have demonstrated a role for the lid in substrate selectivity, in substrate binding, and interactions with colipase. Monolayer experiments, kinetic analysis, and site-specific mutagenesis have broadened the role of colipase in the lipolytic mechanism. It stabilizes the lid in the open, active conformation and may direct PTL to substrate patches on the surface of dietary emulsions, which contain high concentrations of phospholipids and cholesterol esters. This work extends these observations to better define the crucial interactions between colipase and PTL. An increased understanding of the molecular details of this important physiologic process provides the information needed to rationally modulate PTL activity for therapeutic purposes. In the crystal structure of porcine colipase bound to PTL, polar interactions form between colipase residues Glu45, Asn89 (Asp89 in human colipase), Glu64, and Arg65 and residues in the C-terminal domain of PTL (6Egloff M.P. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We mutated each putative lipase-binding residue of colipase to determine whether these amino acids participate in complex formation when the proteins are in solution. Characterization of the colipase mutants showed that substitutions in each targeted site decreased the ability of colipase to bind PTL in the presence of bile salt micelles. Several conclusions can be made from these results. First, residues in the hydrophilic surface of colipase mediate the formation of colipase·PTL complexes in solution as predicted by the crystal structure. Second, bile salt micelles influence the assembly of productive colipase·PTL complexes. Third, both the Glu45/Asp89 and Glu64/Arg65 binding domains contribute to complex formation, but the Glu64/Arg65 binding site predominates. Although the Glu45/Asp89sites tolerated alanine substitutions, any changes, with the exception of a conserved mutation at position 65, in the Glu64/Arg65 binding site greatly diminished the activity of these colipase mutants when assayed above the CMC of TDC. The increased sensitivity of the Glu64/Arg65site compared with the Glu45/Asp89 site was not expected, based on the crystal structure of the PTL·colipase complex (6Egloff M.P. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The carboxylate side chain of Glu64 forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain nitrogen of PTL residue Gln369 and serves as a contact point for a water molecule bridge involving Glu45 of colipase and Ser366 of PTL. Arg65 contributes another hydrogen bond with the side chain of Gln369. In contrast, Glu45 forms the only salt bridge with the C-terminal domain of PTL (Lys400), forms a hydrogen bond with Asn366, and contributes to the water bridge noted above. Asp89 has a hydrogen bond with Lys400 of PTL and contributes to a water bridge with Gly66 of colipase and Leu444 of PTL. Additionally, site-specific mutagenesis of Glu45 and Lys400 of PTL suggested that the ion pairing between these two residues was essential for lipolysis (9Ayvazian L. Crenon I. Hermosos J. Pignol D. Chapus C. Kerfelec B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33604-33609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our results question this conclusion. The preserved function of the E45A colipase mutant suggests that the salt bridge between Glu45 of colipase and Lys400 of PTL is not essential or, alternatively, may not form in solution. Regardless of which binding site was mutated, bile salts altered the behavior of most single substitution mutants. The magnitude of the effect depended on the bile salt concentration. At 0.5 mmTDC, when monomers of bile salts spread at the oil-water interface, the affinity of the colipase mutants for PTL was unchanged except for R65E. At higher TDC concentrations, above the CMC, the affinity of the colipase mutants decreased appreciably for all but the E45A and S44A mutants. At least two models can be offered to explain this observation. The first model proposes that colipase and PTL must form a complex with bile salt micelles in aqueous solution before binding to the interface. There is support for this model in the literature. Multiple studies have demonstrated that bile salt micelles bind to colipase and to PTL (15Sari H. Entressangles B. Desnuelle P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Patton J.S. Donner J. Borgstrom B. Biochim. Biophys.

Lipid Res. 1975; 16: 411-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study with small angle neutron scattering found a detergent micelle associated with the PTL·colipase complex indicating that a complex can form between PTL, colipase, and micelles (19Pignol D. Ayvazian L. kerfelec B. Timmins P. Crenon I. Hermosos J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Chapus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4220-4224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The second model states that colipase and PTL have poor affinity for each other in aqueous solution. In the absence of substrate PTL preferentially binds to bile salt micelles. When a substrate is added, colipase binds to the substrate first. After formation of a complex with substrate, the bound colipase has a higher affinity for PTL than that of the bile salt micelles. PTL then binds to colipase on the substrate surface. Several studies support this model. The concept of a sequential mechanism where colipase binds to the substrate first followed by PTL has been previously proposed and supported by various experiments (2Verger R. Borgstrom B. Brockman H.L. Lipases. Elsevier, Amsterdam1984: 84-150Google Scholar). Other studies using microcalorimetry, two-phase partitioning, and affinity chromatography with immobilized colipase demonstrated that bile salt micelles bind PTL and weaken the binding of colipase to PTL, which may favor the binding of colipase to the substrate surface rather than to complexes of PTL and bile salt micelles (20Patton J.S.

In another study, monomeric bile salt solutions allowed the absorption of PTL to an interface, but a micellar bile salt solution completely inhibited PTL binding to an interface (23Lairon D. Nalbone G. Lafont H. Leonardi J. Domingo N. Hauton J.C. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Two kinetic studies suggested that bile salt micelles or multiple bile salts bind to PTL and inhibit absorption of PTL to the substrate-water interface even in the presence of colipase (24Vandermeers A.

The structures of these amino acids were determined to have 3,4,5- and 2,3,5-trisubstituted pyridine skeletons both with three carboxylic acids and a mass of 396 (C18H28N406) identified as 4-(4-amino-4-carboxybutyl)-3,5-di-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)-pyridine and 2-(4-amino-4-carboxybutyl)-3,5-di-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)-pyridine. We have named these pyridine cross-links desmopyridine (DESP) and isodesmopyridine (IDP), respectively. Structure analysis of these pyridine cross-links implied that the formation of these cross-links involved the condensation reaction between ammonia and allysine. The elastin incubated with ammonium chloride showed that DESP and IDP levels increased as the allysine content decreased. DESP and IDP were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection and were found in a variety of bovine tissues. The DESP/desmosine (DES) and IDP/isodesmosine (IDE) ratios in aorta elastin were higher than in other tissues. DESP and IDP contents in human aorta elastin were found to be gradually increased with age. The concentration of IDP was significantly elevated in aorta elastin of rat with chronic liver cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (mean ± S.D.; 11.1 ± 0.9 nmol/mg elastin) when compared with normal rats (5.9 ± 1.5 nmol/mg elastin). Although DESP and IDP are present at only trace concentrations in the tissue elastin, these pyridine cross-links may be useful biomarkers for the aortic elastin damaged by ammonia.

Although DESP and IDP are present at only trace concentrations in the tissue elastin, these pyridine cross-links may be useful biomarkers for the aortic elastin damaged by ammonia. The elastic properties of several vertebrate tissues such as lung, skin, and large blood vessels are mainly due to the presence of elastic fibers. Elastin, the major component of these fibers, is synthesized by mesenchymal cells as a soluble precursor, tropoelastin, which undergoes posttranslational modifications leading to the formation of specific cross-links that join together several tropoelastin chains (1Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Mecham R.P. FASEB. J. 1993; 7: 1208-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). All of the cross-links in elastin are formed spontaneously after oxidative deamination of specific lysine residues of tropoelastin by lysyl oxidase in the extracellular space. Formed reactive aldehyde, allysine, reacts with lysine and/or another allysine to form polyfunctional cross-links such as allysine-aldol, lysinonorleucine, merodesmosine, desmosine (DES), 1The abbreviations used are:DESdesmosineIDEisodesmosineOXDoxodesmosineIOXDisooxodesmosineDESPdesmopyridineIDPisodesmopyridineHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyAPCallysine-bis-p-cresol derivativeFABfast atom bombardmentHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceGHSQCpulse field gradient heteronuclear single quantum coherenceHMBCheteronuclear multiple-bond coherenceGHMBCpulse field gradient heteronuclear multiple-bond coherence isodesmosine (IDE), and cyclopentenosine (2Pinnell S.R.

In concert with other extracellular matrix macromolecules, these two proteins provide the structural integrity and resiliency required of this specialized blood vessel (12Caro C.G. Pedley T.J. Schroler R.C. Seed W.A. The Mechanisms of Circulation. Oxford University Press, Oxford1978: 254Google Scholar). Extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen and elastin, are known to be greatly affected by age because of impaired functional properties and increased susceptibility to diseases (13Michel J.B. Heudes D. Michel O. Poitevin P. Philippe M. Scalbert E. Corman B. Levy B.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: R124-R135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collagen undergoes progressive changes that are characterized by decreased solubility, decreased proteolytic digestibility, increased heat denaturation time, and accumulation of yellow and fluorescent material (14Schnider S.L.

These changes are thought to result from the formation of age-related intermolecular cross-links (17Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol.

Adnet J.J. Robert L. Exp. Gerontol. 1978; 13: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These changes are accompanied by a reduction of elastin in itself and by content of elastin cross-links. Previously, we isolated two new dihydrooxopyridine cross-links, oxodesmosine (OXD) and isooxodesmosine (IOXD), from the acid hydrolysates of the bovine aortic elastin (20Suyama K. Nakamura F. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1992; 2: 1767-1770Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that OXD and IOXD are oxidative metabolic intermediates generated from DES and IDE in vitro, respectively, by reactive oxygen species (21Umeda H. Nakamura F. Suyama K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Structures of DES, IDE, OXD, and IOXD are shown in Fig. 7. Little is known about the formation of cross-links associated with the damaged elastin in vivo. This study was undertaken to elucidate the chemical nature of cross-linking structures of elastin initiated by lysyl oxidase. We isolated two pyridine cross-links, desmopyridine (DESP) and isodesmopyridine (IDP) from ligamentum nuchae elastin hydrolysates. Using a reverse-phase HPLC assay, we measured the levels of these pyridine cross-links in bovine tissue elastin and showed that the concentrations of both cross-links increased in concert with age in human aorta elastin. In the present study, we found that DESP and IDP were formed during incubation of ammonium chloride with ligamentum nuchae elastin consistent with the decrease of allysine residues. Compared with normal rats, the IDP concentration was found to increase in rat aorta elastin with liver cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride, consistent with the decrease of allysine. These results suggested that allysine residues undergo a Chichibabin reaction (22Frank R.L. Seven R.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1949; 71: 2629-2635Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 23Farley C.P. Eliel E.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 3477-3482Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with ammonia to form DESP and IDP in elastin. IDP may be an abnormal cross-link in elastin. Acetonitrile (HPLC-grade), p-cresol, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, hydrochloric acid, EDTA, carbon tetrachloride, mineral oil (all analytical grade), and diphosphorous pentaoxide (P2O5) were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Activated charcoal (60–150 mesh) and Silica Gel 60 (70–230 mesh) for column chromatography were obtained from Nacalai Tesque, and silica gel (Art. 7734) for column chromatography was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Deuterium oxide (D2O) and dioxane D8 for NMR spectroscopy were obtained from EURISO-TOP (Saint Aubin Cedex, France). Male Wistar rats (200–230 g, 8 weeks of age) were used in the experiments. The animal studies were in strict accordance with the guidelines established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Chronic liver injury was induced in rats by repeated intraperitoneal injections of carbon tetrachloride/mineral oil (1:1) at a dose of 1 ml/kg of body weight three times a week (on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for a total of 10 injections (24Takeuchi T. Prockop D.J. Gastroenterology. 1969; 56: 744-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Rats were killed under diethyl ether anesthesia 4 days after the last injection. Rats were used for this study only when evidence of cirrhosis was confirmed histologically. The elastin from various bovine tissues was purified by the modified technique with 1 mNaCl treatment (described previously (25Nakamura F. Suyama K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar)) as follows. After removing peripheral connective tissue and lipids, bovine tissues (wet weight 10 g) cut into small segments with a mixer were suspended in 1m NaCl (50 ml) for 24 h. The supernatant was discarded after centrifugation, and then the pellet was re-suspended in 1m NaCl. This extraction process was repeated three times. The insoluble residue was washed with distilled water. After centrifugation, the insoluble residue was washed with an excess of distilled water and defatted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) for 48 h, and washed with ethanol and ether. The prepared elastin was dried in vacuo under P2O5. The human aorta was kindly supplied by the Department of Pathology, Tohoku University Hospital. Human aortic samples were obtained from 11 autopsy cases, which had no particular aortic diseases but had sclerotic changes corresponding with their ages. The range of age was from 19 to 75 years old. The materials were taken from nonatherosclerotic areas of the thoracic aorta and were preserved in methanol at −20 °C until analysis. Human aorta elastin was purified by the technique as described above. The elastin for the isolation of DESP and IDP was prepared from fresh bovine ligamentum nuchae (about 1 kg). After acid hydrolysis of elastin with 6 n HCl (110 °C, 48 h), an aliquot of 30 g of its acid hydrolysates was dissolved in distilled water (40 ml) and then charged on a large scale charcoal column (180 × 65 mm). Major lysine-diethyl cross-linking amino acids were fractionated with water (3 liters) followed by elution with 20% aqueous methanol solution (3 liters). The 20% aqueous methanol fraction was evaporated at 50 °C. The residue was dissolved with 40 ml of ethyl acetate/acetic acid/water (1.5:1:1, v/v) and then charged on a large scale silica gel column (130 × 65 mm). After the elution of neutral amino acids with a solvent (1.5 liters) of ethyl acetate/acetic acid/water (1.5:1:1, v/v), most of the lysine-derived cross-links were eluted with water (0.5 liter). The water elution was evaporated at 50 °C. The residue was dissolved with 40 ml of ethyl acetate/acetic acid/water (1.5:1:1, v/v), and then an aliquot of 2 ml was charged on a LiChroprep Si60 (40–63 μm) preparative silica gel column (310–25 mm, Merck) and was fractioned using ethyl acetate/acetic acid/water (1.5:1:1, v/v) as a solvent at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min. DESP and IDP were eluted at 160–180 and 190–210 min, respectively. After removing the solvent by evaporation at 50 °C, the residue containing DESP or IDP was dissolved with water (1.0 ml) containing 0.02 n HCl and then charged on a preparative ODS column (40–63 μm) (LiChroprep RP-18, 310–25 mm, Merck). Both DESP and IDP were eluted at 20–24 min using a solvent of water (1.0 ml) containing 0.02 n HCl, at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min. After this method was repeated five times, DESP and IDP were purified by rechromatography with a preparative silica gel column, respectively. The purity of DESP and IDP was confirmed by silica gel TLC and analytical HPLC. TLC was conducted by precoated Kieselgel 60 on an aluminum sheet (Merck) using ethyl acetate/acetic acid/water (2:1:1, v/v) as a solvent. DESP and IDP were eluted just before DES and IDE revealed characteristic strong ninhydrin-positive spots both with Rf of 0.08 (DES and IDE; origin) on TLC and elution before IDE with Rt of 20.2 and 19.0 min (DES and IDE; Rt of 34.7 and 24.7 min, respectively) on analytical HPLC. DESP and IDP are not artifacts formed from DES and IDE, respectively, by acid hydrolysis. To elucidate this problem, prolonged hydrolysis of elastin or pure DES and IDE was carried out under the condition of 110 °C for 240 h in 6 n HCl. DES and IDE were isolated from acid hydrolysates of bovine ligamentum nuchae elastin by the method of Nakamura and Suyama (26Nakamura F. Suyama K. J. Chromatogr. Sci. 1991; 29: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Dried elastin powder (50 mg) was incubated with 1.0 m ammonium chloride in 5 ml of 0.2 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 μl each of toluene and chloroform to prevent microbial growth. As a control experiment, dried elastin powder (50 mg) was incubated without ammonium chloride in 5 ml of 0.2 mphosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 μl each of toluene and chloroform to prevent microbial growth. The incubation was carried out at 37 °C or 60 °C for the time indicated in Fig. 8. After incubation, insoluble elastin was washed free of excess ammonium chloride three times with distilled water, and then twice with ether/ethanol. The resulting precipitate was dried in vacuounder P2O5 overnight, and an aliquot of 25 mg was subjected to acid hydrolysis with 6 n HCl for 48 h at 110 °C. Elastin hydrolysates were evaporated to dryness in vacuo at 50 °C. The residues were dried over P2O5 and diluted with water (1.0 ml), and then a 20-μl portion of solutions was injected onto the reverse-phase HPLC column. The HPLC system consisted of a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) LC-6A pump, an SPD-6AV UV-VIS spectrophotometric detector, a C-R5A data station, and a Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) L-7300 column oven. Separation was performed with a Mightysil RP-18 150–4.6 (5 μm) reverse-phase (Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. All HPLC chromatographic operations were carried out at 40 °C. Determination of pyridine cross-links was performed with analytical HPLC using a solvent of 0.1m phosphate buffer/acetonitrile (5:1, v/v) containing 20 mm SDS (pH 3.6). Concentrations of DESP and IDP were determined by comparison with DES and IDE, respectively, using analytical HPLC and monitoring at 275 nm. The allysine concentrations in elastin were determined as allysine-bis-p-cresol derivative (APC) as described previously (27Umeda H. Kawamorita K. Suyama K. Amino Acids ( Vienna ). 2001; 20: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Derivatization of allysine in elastin was carried out under the condition of acid hydrolysis (6 n HCl, 110 °C, 48 h). Twenty five ml of elastin was precisely weighed and then dissolved in 5 ml of 6 n HCl containing 5% (w/v)p-cresol in a flame-sealed Pyrex glass. Derivatization of allysine in elastin was carried out under the condition of acid hydrolysis at 110 °C for 48 h. Five ml ofn-hexane/ether (8:2, v/v) was added to the solution after the reaction, and then the organic layer was discarded. Excessp-cresol was extracted with n-hexane/ether (8:2, v/v). APC was not detected by HPLC in the organic layer. The resulting solution was evaporated to dryness in vacuo at 50 °C. The residue was dried over P2O5 and dissolved with HPLC solvent (10 ml); then a 20-μl portion of solution was injected into the reverse-phase HPLC column. The HPLC system consisted of a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) LC-6A pump, an SPD-6AV UV-VIS spectrophotometric detector, a C-R5A data station, and a Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) L-7300 column oven. Separation was performed with a LiChrosper 100 RP-18 125–4 reverse-phase column (Merck). A guard column (LiChrosper 100 RP-18, 4 × 4 mm inner diameter, 5 μm particle size; Merck) was placed just before the inlet of the analytical column to reduce contamination of the analytical column. The mobile phase was composed of 0.05 m sodium dihydrogen phosphate(pH 2.2)/acetonitrile (3:1). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min, and the column temperature was 30 °C. The UV signal was monitored at 282 nm, which corresponds to an absorption maximum for APC. Allysine-aldol was determined as the pyridine derivative, 6-(3-pyridyl)piperidine-2-carboxylic acid by the method of Nakamura and Suyama (25Nakamura F. Suyama K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The HPLC system consisted of a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) LC-6A pump, an SPD-6AV UV-VIS spectrophotometric detector, and a C-R5A data station. Separation was performed with a LiChrosper 100 RP-18 125–4 reverse-phase column (Merck). A guard column (LiChrosper 100 RP-18, 4 × 4 mm inner diameter, 5 μm particle size; Merck) was placed just before the inlet of the analytical column to reduce contamination of the analytical column. The mobile phase was composed of 0.1 m phosphate buffer/acetonitrile (5:1, v/v) containing 20 mm SDS (final pH 3.95). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. The UV signal was monitored at 260 nm, which corresponds to an absorption maximum for 6-(3-pyridyl)piperidine-2-carboxylic acid. Positive ion fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectra were obtained using a JEOL JMS700 mass spectrometer operated at an accelerating voltage of +10 kV. The FAB gun was operated at an accelerating voltage of 6 keV with an emission current of 10 mA using xenon atoms as the bombarding gas. The sample was mixed with glycerol/water. The UV spectra for DESP and IDP were obtained with a UV-2100S spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Structural assignments were made from sample solutions in D2O. NMR measurements were performed at 20 °C using a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer operating at 600 and 150 MHz for 1H and 13C NMR experiments, respectively. 1H and 13C chemical shifts were internally referenced to dioxane at 3.5 and 66.3 ppm, respectively. The water resonance was attenuated by presaturation during the 0.5-s relaxation delay. 1H resonance assignments were obtained using 1H-1H correlated spectroscopy (1H-1H COSY). Data matrix was 512 real by 2048 complex for the 1H-1H COSY experiment. Simultaneous 1H and 2H decoupling of13C was achieved with a WALTZ-16 pulse sequence during relaxation (1H) and acquisition (1H,2H). The 13C resonance from carbon with a directly attached proton was assigned using heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectroscopy. HSQC spectroscopy was the pulse field gradient standard Varian program GHSQC. The 13C resonances from carbons without a directly attached proton were assigned using heteronuclear multiple-bond coherence (HMBC) spectroscopy. HMBC spectroscopy was the pulse field gradient standard Varian program GHMQC. Carbon multiplicity was established by distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer. DESP and IDP were isolated from acid hydrolysates of bovine ligamentum nuchae elastin by normal- and reversed-phase chromatography. DESP and IDP were well separated by reverse-phase ODS column chromatography using a solvent of water containing 0.02 n HCl, which is the general solvent system for peptides, suggesting that those compounds are polyfunctional amino acids. The purities of DESP and IDP were confirmed by TLC and analytical HPLC analyses. DESP and IDP were completely separated by TLC as heavy ninhydrin single spots (Rf of both compounds was 0.08; Rf of both DES and IDE was 0.0). With HPLC elution systems that will resolve IDE and DES, DESP and IDP were (Rt = 20.2 and 19.0 min, respectively) eluted before DES (Rt = 34.7 min) and IDE (Rt = 24.7 min) and fractionated as single peaks (Fig. 1). DESP and IDP were hygroscopic, white solids with a faint yellow tinge and were soluble in aqueous solvents but not in dry methanol. The UV spectra of DESP and IDP are shown in Fig. 2. DESP exhibited absorption maximum at 264.8 nm in 0.1 n HCl. The UV spectrum was reversibly shifted in 0.1 n NaOH. The UV absorption spectrum of DESP was characteristic of 3,4,5-trisubstituted pyridine, such as 4-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyridine (28Suyama K. Adachi S. J. Org. Chem. 1979; 44: 1417-1420Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). IDP exhibited absorption maximum at 272.0 nm in 0.1 n HCl. The absorption maximum was reversibly shifted in 0.1 n NaOH to 271.1 nm. The absorption spectrum of IDP was characteristic of 2,3,5-trisubstituted pyridine, such as 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyridine (28Suyama K. Adachi S. J. Org. Chem. 1979; 44: 1417-1420Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Crucial structural information was obtained from the1H NMR (in D2O). Peaks in the aromatic region are sharp singlets; comparison with DES and IDE indicated that DESP and IDP are 3,4,5- and 2,3,5-trisubstituted pyridines, respectively. A schematic drawing of DESP and IDP is shown in Fig.3, respectively and indicates the numbering system used. The proton assignments were completed using 1H-1H COSY experiments, shown in Fig.3, B and D. The 1H NMR spectrum of DESP showed the following signals for δ H (D2O): 1.624 (H-12, 2H), 1.818 (H-13, 2H), 2.090 (H-8, 2H), 2.090 (H-17, 2H), 2.818–2.927 (H-7, 2H), 2.818–2.916 (H-16, 2H), 2.807–2.916 (H-11, 2H), 3.810 (H-9, 1H, t), 3.810 (H-14, 1H, t), 3.908 (H-18, 1H), 8.374 (H-2, 1H, s), 8.374 (H-6, 1H, s). 1H NMR (in D2O) for DESP is shown in Fig. 3 A. The triplet at 3.908 ppm and the proton signals at 3.810 ppm suggested the presence of three α-protons compatible with the presence of three amino acids. As shown in Fig. 3 B, these α-protons showed a spin-spin interaction between aliphatic protons at 2.090 and 1.818 ppm, respectively. The proton signals at 2.818–2.927 and 2.818–2.916 ppm suggested the presence of methyl groups on the pyridine ring. These methyl proton signals showed a spin-spin interaction between aliphatic protons at 2.090 and 1.624 ppm, respectively. The proton singlet at 8.374 ppm suggested the presence of two aromatic protons in the pyridine molecule with substitutions in symmetric positions 2 and 6 by comparing the ratio of the areas under 1H NMR. The1H NMR spectrum of IDP showed the following signals for δ H (D2O): 1.592–1.605 (H-8, 2H), 1.823 (H-9, 2H), 2.018 (H-17, 2H), 2.030 (H-13, 2H), 2.705 (H-12, 2H), 2.722 (H-16, 2H), 2.892 (H-7, 2H, t), 3.744 (H-10, 1H), 3.758 (H-14, 1H), 3.817 (H-18, 1H, t), 8.144 (H-4, 1H, s), 8.248 (H-6, 1H, s). 1H NMR (in D2O) for IDP is shown in Fig.3 C. The three coupled triplets at 3.744, 3.758, and 3.817 ppm suggested the presence of three α-protons compatible with the presence of three amino acids. These three α-protons showed a spin-spin interaction between aliphatic protons at 1.823, 2.030, and 2.018 ppm. The triplet at 2.892 ppm and the proton signals at 2.705 and 2.722 ppm suggested the presence of three methyl groups on the pyridine ring. These methyl protons showed a spin-spin interaction between aliphatic protons at 1.592 and 1.605, 2.030, and 2.018 ppm, respectively, as revealed by a 1H-1H COSY experiment. The two proton singlets in the aromatic region (δ 8.144 and δ 8.248) suggested the presence of two aromatic protons in the pyridine molecule with substitutions in asymmetric positions 4 and 6. The 13C NMR resonances of DESP and IDP were assigned using a combination of GHSQC and GHMBC spectra. The 13C NMR spectra of DESP and IDP are shown in Fig.4 A and Fig.5 A, respectively. All the resonances of proton-attached carbons were readily assigned based on the one-bond 1H-13C correlation cross-peaks in the GHSQC spectrum shown in Figs. 4 B and 5B. The assignments were confirmed by two-bond and three-bond1H-13C correlation cross-peaks in the GHMBC spectra, as shown in Figs.4C and 5C. The13C resonance of the nonproton-attached carbons was also assigned based on the cross-peaks, in the GHMBC spectra. The13C NMR spectra of DESP showed the following signals for δ C (D2O): 25.853 (C-12), 26.350 (C-7, C-16), 30.332 (C-13), 31.349 (C-8, C-17), 47.462 (C-11), 54.225 (C-9, C-18), 54.393 (C-14), 139.577 (C-2, C-6), 139.789 (C-3, C-5), 160.836 (C-4), 173.538 (C-10), 173.830 (C-15, C-19). In DESP, all of the carbons on the aromatic ring showed resonance in the chemical shift range of 139.577–160.836 ppm. The 13C resonances at 139.577 ppm had GHSQC cross-peaks to the H-2 and H-6 protons. The only GHMBC cross-peak from 13C resonances at 139.577 ppm was to the H-7 proton resonance. This demonstrated that the resonance at 139.577 ppm was from the C-2 carbon. The only GHMBC cross-peak from 13C resonances at 139.577 ppm was to the H-16 proton resonance. This demonstrated that the resonance at 139.577 ppm was from the C-6 carbon. The 13C resonance at 139.789 ppm had no cross-peaks in the GHSQC spectrum. The resonance at 139.789 ppm was assigned to both the C-3 and C-5 carbons because it is the only 13C resonance that has GHMBC cross-peaks to both the H-8 and H-17. The13C resonance at 160.836 ppm was assigned to the C-4 carbon because it is the only 13C resonance that has GHMBC cross-peaks to the following protons: H-2, H-6, H-7, and H-16. The13C NMR spectra of IDP showed the following signals for δ C (D2O): 25.054 (C-8), 27.045 (C-16), 28.009 (C-12), 30.363 (C-9), 30.537 (C-7), 31.152 (C-17), 31.363 (C-13), 53.879 (C-10), 54.104 (C-14, C-18), 139.007 (C-5), 139.584 (C-3), 139.420 (C-6), 148.025 (C-4), 153.058 (C-2), 173.415 (C-19), 173.714 (C-15), 173.512 (C-11). In IDP, all of the carbons on the aromatic ring showed resonance in the chemical shift range of 139.007–153.058 ppm. The resonances of the C-4 and the C-6 carbons were easily assigned based on the GHSQC. That is, the resonances at 148.025 and 139.420 ppm were assigned to the C-4 and C-6 carbon, respectively. The resonance at 153.058 ppm was assigned to the C-2 carbon because it is the only13C resonance that has GHMBC cross-peaks to both the H-4 and H-6 protons on the aromatic ring. The resonance at 139.007 ppm was assigned to the C-5 carbon because it is the only 13C resonance that has GHMBC cross-peaks to both the H-6 and H-17 protons. The resonance at 139.584 ppm was assigned to the C-3 carbon because it is the only 13C resonance that has GHMBC cross-peaks to both the H-4 and H-13 protons. The FAB mass spectrum on glycerol matrix showed a molecular ion at m/z of 397 (M + H+) as shown in Fig. 6. High resolution FAB-mass spectroscopy in the positive ion mode showed the molecular mass of 397.2. This corresponded to the molecular formula C18H28N406 and was in agreement with the proposed structure. Based on these characteristics, DESP and IDP were determined as 3,4, 5- and 2, 3, 5-trisubstituted pyridine cross-links, respectively.Figure 31 H (A),1H-1H COSY (B), NMR spectra of DESP and 1H (C), and1H-1H COSY (D) NMR spectra of IDP.

It has been established that suppression of uPA expression and invasiveness by UTI is mediated through inhibition of protein kinase C-dependent signaling pathways and that human chondrosarcoma cell line HCS-2/8 expresses two types of UTI-BPs; a 40-kDa UTI-BP (UTI-BP40), which is identical to link protein (LP), and a 45-kDa UTI-BP (UTI-BP45). Here we characterize binding properties of UTI-BPs·UTI complexes in the cells. In vitro ligand blot, cell binding and competition assays, and Scatchard analyses demonstrate that both UTI-BP40 and UTI-BP45 bind125I-UTI. A deglycosylated form of UTI (NG-UTI), from which the chondroitin-sulfate side chain has been removed, binds only to UTI-BP40. Additional experiments, using various reagents to block binding of 125I-UTI and NG-UTI to the UTI-BP40 and UTI-BP45 confirm that the chondroitin sulfate side chain of UTI is required for its binding to UTI-BP45. Analysis of binding of125I-UTI and NG-UTI to the cells suggests that low affinity binding sites are the UTI-BP40 (which can bind NG-UTI), and the high affinity sites are the UTI-BP45. In addition, UTI-induced suppression of phorbol ester stimulated up-regulation of uPA is inhibited by reagents that were shown to prevent binding of UTI to the 40- and 45-kDa proteins. We conclude that UTI must bind to both of the UTI-BPs to suppress uPA up-regulation.

However, UTI-binding sites on the cell surface of U937 and neutrophils were completely saturated with endogenous UTI when these cells were cultured in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum (3Kobayashi H. Gotoh J. Fujie M. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20642-20647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20642-20647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, incubation of U937 cells and HUVEC with UTI had no effect on the ability of PMA to stimulate cell-associated uPA expression (4Kobayashi H. Gotoh J. Terao T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 380-386PubMed Google Scholar). However, induction of uPA expression by TNF-α was efficiently inhibited when the U937 and HUVEC were incubated with UTI (4Kobayashi H. Gotoh J. Terao T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 380-386PubMed Google Scholar). One may estimate that the disparity is because of the difference of signaling cascades in cells used in the experiments. Whereas both of these UTI-BPs appear to mediate binding to UTI, it is not known how two types of UTI-BPs may interact with UTI or if they mediate signals for UTI following ligation by the different domains within the UTI molecule. The purpose of this study was to evaluate further structure-function relationship of UTI by comparing interaction of truncated polypeptides with cells. UTI is structurally and functionally organized into distinct domains; therefore, we utilized purified proteins encompassing its three major domains, amino-terminal domain (N-domain), chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S) side chain, and carboxyl-terminal domain (C-domain; an active protease inhibitor domain), to assess interactions between UTI and cell-associated UTI-BPs. To identify the structural determinants on UTI required for cell association and regulation of the uPA-dependent signal transduction, UTI derivatives (non-glycosylated UTI (NG-UTI) and the carboxyl-terminal fragment of UTI (HI-8) were produced (see Fig. 1). We describe experiments designed to determine whether the UTI-BPs are capable of delivering an UTI-dependent modulation of uPA expression. We have examined two types of experimental situation; binding capacity of UTI to the cells or its binding sites and responses to UTI in cells stimulated with phorbol ester. We have used a human chondrosarcoma cell line HCS-2/8 that stably expresses two proteins (UTI-BP40 and UTI-BP45) to determine whether interaction of these proteins is important for ligand-UTI-BP function. We report here that NG-UTI is bound via UTI-BP40 and does not suppress uPA expression and that ligation of UTI-BP45by the C4S side chain of UTI in conjunction with the UTI-BP40 promote suppression of phorbol ester-induced uPA expression. UTI was purified to homogeneity from human urine. A highly purified preparation of human UTI was kindly supplied by Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan. The carboxyl-terminal fragment of UTI (HI-8) was purified as previously described (2Kobayashi H. Shibata K. Fujie M. Sugino D. Terao T.

Briefly, to generate anti-LP peptide antibodies, two synthetic oligopeptide sequences, 112VFLKGGSDSDAS123 (amino-terminal fragment of LP) and 231TVPGVRNYGFWDKDKS246(carboxyl-terminal fragment of LP), corresponding to the amino-terminal domain and the carboxyl-terminal domain of human LP molecule, respectively, were selected. Antisera against LP synthetic oligopeptides (anti-LPpep-N and anti-LPpep-C) were obtained from rabbits immunized four times with 0.2 mg of peptide conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin together with Freund's adjuvant (6Kobayashi H.

UTI was radioiodinated with carrier-free Na125I. Briefly, 5 μg of UTI was placed in a conical microvial and then dissolved in 20 μl of 50 mm sodium bicarbonate. Tris-HCl buffer (20 μl each of 50 mm and 500 mm, pH 7.4), 1 mCi of carrier-free Na125I, and 5 μg of lactoperoxidase were added to the iodination vial. The iodination reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of H2O2 diluted 1:75,000. After 2 min, the reaction mixture was applied on a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10 column; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4.125I-UTI obtained from the PD-10 column was diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.2% BSA, pH 7.4, filter-sterilized, and then stored at 4 °C. NG-UTI and HI-8 were also labeled according to the manufacturer's instructions. UTI, NG-UTI, and HI-8 were labeled with 125I, resulting in a specific radioactivity of 4,500 cpm/ng (UTI), 5,100 cpm/ng (NG-UTI), and 2,500 cpm/ng (HI-8), without loss of latent protease inhibitory activity. HCS-2/8 cells (1.0 ml, 5 × 106 cells, >95% viable) were incubated at 23 °C for 2 h in RPMI 1640, pH 7.4 containing 10 μg/ml hyaluronidase with gentle shaking. The cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 containing 2% BSA. Analysis of the viability showed that 2 h after incubation of the cells with hyaluronidase, >92% of the cells were viable. Hyaluronidase-treated cells were used for further experiments after washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells (2 × 108) preincubated with serum-free medium overnight were treated with PBS containing protease inhibitor mixture supplemented with hyaluronidase (10 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C (3Kobayashi H.

Confluent monolayers of HCS-2/8 were grown in 24-well plate wells using complete medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were washed twice each with serum-free medium supplemented with 0.1% BSA. The cells were maintained overnight in serum-free medium. Monolayers were cooled to 4 °C and washed twice with Tyrode's Hepes solution containing 2% BSA (washing buffer). The cells were then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h in binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2% BSA, pH 7.8) containing various concentrations of 125I-labeled UTI or NG-UTI (0–10 nm) and washed four times. The binding of125I-UTI to cells was then determined as previously described (7Kobayashi H. Hirashima Y. Terao T. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2000; 6: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The contents of the wells were removed using 1 N NaOH, and radioactivity was measured using a γ-counter. Each experimental point was performed in at least duplicate wells. The nonspecific binding, determined as the percent of input counts bound in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled UTI, was ∼9% and was subtracted from all raw data to give the specific bound counts. In a parallel experiment, cells were incubated with 125I-UTI (1 nm) for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of several competitors and then washed four times. Cell extracts (detergent phase) and supernatants (hyaluronidase-soluble phase) were tested for UTI-BP40 and UTI-BP45 by Western blot or by ligand blotting with labeled ligands. For ligand blotting, purified UTI-BPs, LP, hyaluronidase-soluble, or detergent phase-separated membrane fractions were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions, electroblotted to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad), and blocked for 2 h at 23 °C in Tris-buffered saline contining 2% BSA. The filters were then incubated for 16 h at 4 °C in the presence of 1 nm iodinated ligand in binding buffer, washed three times, and autoradiographed for 18 h to 2 days. Each band was cut from the membrane, and radioactivity was measured using a γ-counter. The assays were performed with duplicate samples. The nonspecific binding was subtracted from all raw data to give the specific bound counts. In a parallel experiment, Western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against LP was performed as described previously (6Kobayashi H. Hirashima Y. Sun G.W. Fujie M. Nishida T.

Plasminogen activator (PA) activity in the cell-conditioned media (100 μl) was quantitated utilizing a functional assay for plasmin. Medium (100 μl) was then incubated for 3 h in buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline containing plasminogen (0.165 units/ml) and S-2251 (0.5 mm)) as the chromogenic substrate of plasmin. In a parallel experiment, after the monolayer cells were washed, the medium was replaced with buffer A and incubated for 1 h to determine the cell-associated PA activity. The amount ofp-nitroaniline released was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. Each assay was run with a plasminogen-free blank. The data presented are the mean of triplicate determinations in one representative experiment unless stated otherwise. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. All statistical analysis was performed using StatView for Macintosh. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for the comparisons between different groups. p less than 0.05 was considered significant. UTI (molecular mass, 40 kDa) is composed of the N-domain, a C4S sugar side chain, and the C-domain that has been considered to exist as a protease inhibitor domain (Fig. 1). Previous work suggested that the N-domain is important for binding of UTI to the cells (3Kobayashi H. Gotoh J. Fujie M. Terao T. J. Biol.

To gain insight into the ability of these modules within the UTI molecule to bind to the UTI-binding sites on the cells, deletion fragments of this protein were produced, purified, and used as125I-labeled ligands for cell binding and ligand blotting analyses. As shown in Fig. 1, under nonreducing conditions, NG-UTI and HI-8 have an apparent molecular mass of 25 and 8 kDa, respectively. We have previously demonstrated that there are at least two types of UTI binding sites, the UTI-BP40and the UTI-BP45, on the surface of certain cells, and binding of UTI to cells is specifically inhibited by monoclonal antibodies 4G12 and 8H11, which recognize the N-domain of UTI, demonstrating that UTI binds to the cells via the N-domain of UTI (3Kobayashi H.

We first tested for the presence of UTI-BPs in HCS-2/8 cells by a ligand-blotting analysis. Affinity-purified UTI-BP40 and UTI-BP45 proteins prepared from HCS-2/8 cell lysate (6Kobayashi H.

To identify the structural determinants on UTI required for cell association, NG-UTI and HI-8 were produced and used as 125I-labeled ligands. We incubated 125I-labeled ligands with affinity-purified UTI-BP40 or UTI-BP45 transferred to PVDF paper in the presence or absence of an excess amount of unlabeled compounds. We found that the cells contain, in addition to a 40-kDa UTI-BP40, also a 45-kDa UTI-BP45 (Fig.2, lane 1), because125I-UTI can bind to both of these UTI-BPs (lane 3). The binding of 125I-UTI to UTI-BP40and UTI-BP45 was completely competed by unlabeled UTI (lane 6), supporting the identification of these bands as UTI-specific binding proteins. We next investigated the binding properties of UTI derivatives lacking the C4S side chain or the N-domain. 125I-UTI bound to UTI-BP40 and UTI-BP45, whereas125I-NG-UTI binds to UTI-BP40 only (lane 9). 125I-HI-8 failed to bind any of the UTI-BPs (data not shown), demonstrating that there was no indication that the C-domain of UTI was involved in binding of UTI to these UTI-BPs. Of interest is the observation that the C4S side chain of UTI moiety would take place in binding of the UTI to UTI-BP45 as judged from the above observation. Hyaluronidase-soluble (Fig. 2H, lanes 4, 7, 10, and 13) and the detergent (Fig. 2D, lanes 5, 8, 11, and 14) phases of cells were phase-separated and analyzed for the presence of UTI-BPs. The two phases were analyzed by ligand and immunoblotting for binding to 125I-UTI, 125I-NG-UTI, or125I-HI-8 and to polyclonal antibodies raised against LP (Fig. 2, anti-LP, lanes 12–14). In the detergent-soluble extract (lane 5), 125I-UTI bound mainly to a slowly migrating band comigrating with UTI-BP45; however, in the hyaluronidase-soluble extract (lane 4), it bound mainly to a band comigrating with UTI-BP40. This latter band corresponds to LP on the basis of comigration with LP and reaction with anti-LP antibody. We cannot explain the reason why a substantial amount of the 45- and 40-kDa protein"

We have investigated the transcriptional regulatory mechanism that drives this precise spatial expression pattern of the nocturnin gene. A deletion series of the nocturnin 5′-flanking sequence driving the green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter was used to generate transgenicXenopus tadpoles. We found that a construct containing 2.6 kilobase pairs of 5′-flanking sequence targeted high level GFP reporter expression specifically to photoreceptor cells, in a pattern identical to endogenous nocturnin. This photoreceptor-specific expression pattern was maintained with several further deletions of 5′-upstream sequence, including a short 59-base pair fragment. Within this region of 59 base pairs, three perfect repeats of a novel protein binding site were identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Competitions using varying oligonucleotide sequences demonstrated that the sequence required for protein binding is CAGACAGGCTATA, designated photoreceptor-conserved element II (PCE II). The protein complex that binds to this element is enriched in retinal extracts, and mutations of PCE II which fail to bind the protein complex also fail to direct GFP reporter expression to photoreceptors. These results indicate that the PCE II in the proximal promoter of the nocturnin gene is sufficient for driving the photoreceptor-specific expression of nocturnin.

Within most of the central nervous system of vertebrates, the study of spatial regulation of transcription is difficult because of the vast heterogeneity of this tissue. The retina is a part of the central nervous system which is more amenable to these types of study because the cells are organized in morphologically distinct layers, and the various cell types have been well characterized (1Cepko C.L.

Despite the identification of these protein-binding elements, the transcriptional regulatory mechanism that governs the photoreceptor-specific expression of these genes is still not known. In many cases the examination of these elements have only been done in vitro.Nocturnin is a retina-specific gene first identified in Xenopus laevis by a differential display screen seeking circadian clock-regulated genes (19Green C.B. Besharse J.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Green C.B. Besharse J.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 85: 219-230PubMed Google Scholar). In situ hybridization demonstrated that nocturnin was specifically expressed in the photoreceptor layer within the retina (21Green C.B. Besharse J.C. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In both cyclic light and constant darkness, nocturnin mRNA rises in early night (or subjective night) and returns to low levels around midnight. The mRNA rhythms are controlled by the retinal circadian clock at the level of transcription (21Green C.B. Besharse J.C. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The precise spatial and temporal pattern of gene transcription makes the nocturnin promoter an interesting candidate for studies of transcriptional regulation.The transgenic technique in Xenopus provides a unique experimental method to address questions of specific gene expressionin vivo (22Kroll K.L. Amaya E. Development. 1996; 122: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Amaya E. Kroll K.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 97: 393-414PubMed Google Scholar). The transgenic method results in animals that are not mosaic and can therefore be analyzed directly without breeding (24Marsh-Armstrong N. Huang H. Berry D.L. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14389-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated that a GFP reporter can be faithfully targeted to specific tissues using tissue-specific promoter/enhancers (22Kroll K.L. Amaya E.

To investigate the regulatory mechanism of the nocturnin gene, we analyzed the in vivoexpression patterns of GFP reporters driven by various portions of the nocturnin 5′-flanking sequence in transgenic Xenopus. Thein vivo experiments, coupled with in vitrobinding studies, resulted in the identification of a novel element that is sufficient to drive reporter gene expression specifically in retinal photoreceptors. We have named this novel element PCE II.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of GFP Reporter PlasmidsThe transcription start site of nocturnin has been identified previously using both primer extension and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (21Green C.B. Besharse J.C. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Abbreviations of upstream sequences are based on the sequence position relative to the transcription start site. For example, XNP(−2.6kb/+20bp)-GFP refers to the construct of GFP driven by the Xenopus nocturnin promoter from 2.6 kb upstream to 20 bp downstream of the transcription start site.XNP(−2.6kb/+20bp)-GFPA Xenopus nocturnin genomic clone was cut with SacI and BsmBI to generate a fragment extending from ∼2.6 kb upstream of the transcription start site to 20 bp downstream. This fragment was cloned into the SacI and SmaI sites of the pGEM7 vector and named p42B2. This ∼2.6-kb fragment was then excised withSacI and HindIII and cloned into theSacI/HindIII sites of the pEGFP vector (CLONTECH).XNP(−398/+20bp)-GFPThe p42B2 clone was digested withSpeI and HindIII and then cloned into theNheI and HindIII sites of the pGL2-basic vector (Promega), XNP(−398/+20bp)-Luc. This fragment was then excised with SacI and HindIII and transferred into the pEGFP vector.XNP(−161/+20bp)-GFP and XNP(−108/+20bp)-GFPSpecific PCR primers were designed to amplify these smaller 5′-upstream fragments from XNP(−398/+20bp)-Luc.Primer −161/−140bp (forward): 5′-GGAAAGTTGTAACTATGTGCGGCATTTACA-3′;Primer −108−88bp (forward): 5′-GACTGTGACGTGGCTTCTTTCT-3′;Downstream vector primer (GL primer 2; reverse): 5′-GAAATACAAAAACCGCAGAAGG-3′ (Promega).PCR was performed as described below. These two resulting PCR fragments were each subcloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector using the TOPO-TA kit (Invitrogen) and then transferred into the pEGFP vector at theXhoI and HindIII sites.XNP(−77/−18bp)-GFP and Mut-PCE-GFPComplementary oligonucleotides containing three repeats of the PCE II (−77/−18bp) and mutant PCE II (Mut-PCE) elements were synthesized (Life Technologies, Inc. and MWG Biotech, Inc.) flanked with restriction enzyme cutting sites.XNP(−77/−18bp): 5′-CCGAGCTCGAGGGGGTCAGACAGGCTTATAGGCAGACAGGCTTATATCTGGCAGACAGGCTTATATCTGCCAGATCTCC-3′ (SacI/XhoI and BglII; underlined).Mut-PCE: 5′-CCCTCGAGGGGTTGAGTCGGCTTATAGGTGAGTCGGCTTATATCTGGTGAGTCGGCTTATATCTGCCAAGCTTCC-3′ (added XhoI and HindIII sites are underlined; mutated sites are bold).The two complementary XNP(−77/−18bp) oligonucleotides were annealed as described in the EMSA method (below) and cloned into theSacI and BglII sites of the pGL2-basic vector. It was then excised by XhoI and HindIII and transferred into the pEGFP vector. The two complementary Mut-PCE oligonucleotides were annealed and then directly subcloned into theXhoI and HindIII sites of the pEGFP vector.All constructs were verified by sequencing after subcloning. For transgenic experiments, constructs XNP(−2.6kb/+20bp)-GFP, XNP(−398/+20bp)-GFP, XNP(−77/−18bp)-GFP, and the GFP vector with no promoter were linearized using XhoI; XNP(−161/+20bp)-GFP using SalI; XNP(−108/+20bp)-GFP and Mut-PCE-GFP usingBglII. Linear DNA was precipitated and brought to a final concentration of 150–200 ng/μl in H2O.Producing Transgenic Xenopus TadpolesTransgenic Xenopus embryos were produced as described previously (22Kroll K.L. Amaya E. Development. 1996; 122: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Amaya E. Kroll K.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 97: 393-414PubMed Google Scholar), with modifications as shown below. Briefly, eggs were squeezed from human chorionic gonadotropin-stimulated frogs and rinsed in 1 × MMR (0.1 m NaCl, 2 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) for 10 min followed by dejellying in 3 mm dithiothreitol. Restriction enzyme-mediated integration reaction (4 μl of nuclei (100 nuclei/nl), 1 μl of linearized DNA, 9 μl of sperm dilution buffer (250 mm sucrose, 75 mm KCl, 0.5 mmspermidine trihydrochloride, 0.2 mm spermine tetrahydrochloride), 100 mm MgCl2, 1.5–2 μl of oocyte extract, and 0.5 μl of restriction enzyme (1:5 dilution in sperm dilution buffer)) was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then diluted into MOH (10 mm KPO4, pH 7.2, 125 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 0.25 mm spermidine, and 0.125 mm spermine). The restriction enzyme-mediated integration was diluted to a final concentration of three sperms/5 nl, and this dilution was injected into unfertilized eggs (about 5 nl/egg), which has been empirically determined to result in one functional sperm nucleus being delivered to the majority of eggs. Embryos were maintained in 0.25 × NAM (110 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm KCl, 1.0 mmCa(NO3)2, 1.0 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.0 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1.0 mm NaHCO3) plus 50 mg/liter gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2–3 days, and then the tadpoles were transferred to dechlorinated water. They were maintained at 21 °C in a 12-h light:12-h dark cycle.MicroscopyTadpoles (10–14 days old) were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline. The samples were equilibrated in 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline, embedded in O.C.T. compound (Ted Pella, Inc.), and frozen sections (12-μm thickness) were prepared. Images were obtained on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope and digitized by OlymPix camera system. A fluorescein isothiocyanate/enhanced GFP long pass filter cube (41012, Chroma) was used for fluorescent images. Some images were generated using confocal microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TE200, KECK Center for Cellular Imaging, University of Virginia). Green fluorescent images were generated using 488 nm blue argon. Three-dimensional images were obtained using serial optical sections with the C.Imaging software (Compix, Inc.). Each image of the Z-series composite is 20 μm thick.Identification of Transgenic Tadpoles by PCRTails of the tadpoles were cut (∼0.5 cm), and genomic DNA was isolated using DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). PCR primers used to amplify nocturnin were: (forward) 5′-ATGGGAAACAGCACCAGCAGAC-3′ and (reverse) 5′-GCCAGAATGTTCCACTGCATCAC-3′. PCR primers used to amplify GFP were: (GFP 219-forward) 5′-CAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTCATCTG-3′ and (GFP 602-reverse) 5′-CGGATCTTGAAGTTGACCTTGATC-3′. The reaction mixture for PCR included 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 15 mm ammonium sulfate, 1.25 mm MgCl2 for GFP (2.5 mm for nocturnin), 1 mm each dNTP, 5 ng/μl of each primer, and 1.5 unit of AmpliTaq-Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCR profile was as follows: 10 min at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, 55 °C for 1 min (for GFP, 50 °C for nocturnin), and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final 10 min at 72 °C. PCR results were analyzed on 1% agarose gels.Isolation of Retinal Nuclear ExtractsAdult frogs were maintained on 12-h light:12-h dark cycles. Adult eyes were dissected at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 2 and ZT 11.5, in which ZT 0 is defined as the time of light onset (dawn) and ZT 12 as dark onset (dusk). Brain, muscle, liver, and heart were dissected at ZT 11.5. Nuclear extracts for EMSA were prepared from adultXenopus retinas and other tissues using the method modified from (27Frederick M Ausuhel R.

Tissues were homogenized and pelleted in phosphate-buffered saline and then quickly resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 10% Igepal (Fisher) at 4 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm, the pellet was dissolved in high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The nuclei were extracted for 20–30 min on a shaking platform at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm. The supernatant was quickly frozen in aliquots and then stored at −70 °C until use. Protein concentrations were tested using the standard method of Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad).EMSAOligonucleotides used as probes in EMSA are listed in Fig.8 B (Life Technologies, Inc. and MWG Biotech, Inc.). Two complementary oligonucleotides were annealed in the polynucleotide kinase buffer by heating to 65 °C for 10 min and then cooling slowly to room temperature. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and purified by NucTrap columns (Stratagene). Binding reaction mixtures included the following: 2–4-μg nuclear extracts (for retinas it was a mixture of extracts isolated at ZT 2 and ZT 11.5), 8 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm spermidine, 1 μg of salmon sperm, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 0.03% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Ficoll, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and ∼1 ng of radiolabeled probe. Binding reactions (15 μl) were incubated for 0.5 h at room temperature. For competition assays, 50- and 200-fold unlabeled oligonucleotides were added and incubated for 20–30 min at room temperature before the addition of radiolabeled probe. A 6% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) was preelectrophoresed in 0.5 × TBE (44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm boric acid, 1.25 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) for at least 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were electrophoresed at a constant voltage of 210 V at 4 °C for 2 h. Dry gels were exposed to film for 1–12 h at room temperature.RESULTSIn the studies presented here, our goal was to define the portion of the nocturnin promoter/enhancer responsible for correct spatial expression of the nocturnin gene. Previous analysis of the endogenous nocturnin mRNA by Northern blot showed that nocturnin mRNA can be detected only in the retina and is not evident in brain, heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, or liver (19Green C.B. Besharse J.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In situhybridization demonstrated that within the Xenopus retina the expression of the nocturnin mRNA is spatially restricted to the retinal photoreceptor cells (19Green C.B. Besharse J.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).A portion of a Xenopus nocturnin genomic clone containing ∼2.6 kb of 5′-flanking sequence and 20 bp of transcribed sequence was isolated. A portion of the most proximal (−398/+20bp) of this sequence is shown in Fig. 1 A. There are several putative protein binding sites in this region, including an E-box-like element, CRX-like elements, and three perfect repeats of a previously unidentified element (labeled PCE II). Serial deletions (constructs 1–5) and a mutant (construct 6) of the 5′-flanking sequence were made as shown in Fig. 1 B. GFP reporters driven by different lengths of the nocturnin 5′-flanking sequence were used to generate transgenic tadpoles for examination of the resulting GFP expression patterns.Figure 1Panel A, sequence of the nocturnin 5′-flanking region, XNP(−398/+20bp). Numbers on the topof the sequence are the relative positions before (−) and after (+) the transcription start site, which is designated as +1. Putative protein binding sites are shown in bold and labeled on the top of the sequence. The sequences used as the PCR primers to produce smaller fragments of the nocturnin promoter are underlined.

Endogenous nocturnin was amplified (∼250-bp band) to monitor the quality of genomic DNA, and GFP coding sequence was amplified (∼480-bp band) to examine whether XNP-GFP constructs had been integrated into the tadpole genome. Fig. 2shows the PCR results from the various samples of transgenic-positive tadpoles (tadpoles 2–7), and a nontransgenic tadpole (tadpole 1) is exhibited in Figs. 3 to 7. Endogenous nocturnin bands were seen in all of the tadpoles, whereas the GFP bands were observed only in the transgenic-positive tadpoles.Figure 2Genotyping of transgenic tadpoles by PCR. DNA isolated from clipped tails of the tadpoles, produced using different XNP-GFP constructs, was analyzed by PCR. Thefirst two lanes are PCR results using plasmids containing nocturnin (first lane) and GFP coding sequences (second lane) as templates; they serve as size controls for the amplified products. The positions of the GFP and nocturnin (Noc) bands are labeled on the left. Lanes marked 1–7 are the PCR results from transgenic tadpoles 1–7 produced by different constructs.

The constructs used for transgenesis are shown on the top of the images of each group. In panel A, the images in the first row are from a PCR-positive tadpole (tadpole 2 from Fig. 2), and the images in the second roware from a PCR-negative sibling tadpole (tadpole 1 from Fig. 2). Thefirst two columns are phase-contrast images (left) and fluorescent images (right) under low magnification. Higher magnification images are shown under phase-contrast and fluorescence in the next two columns. The images in the last column are merged images of the phase-contrast and the fluorescent images, so both the green fluorescence and cell structures are visible at the same time. GFP was observed only in the cell bodies of the photoreceptor cells in the transgenic retina in the first row and not in the nontransgenic sibling or in the GFP-only control embryo (panel B). The red pseudocolor background in the merged images was added to enhance the contrast for clearer visualization of the cellular structures.

Our PCR results confirmed that 40–80% of the living tadpoles resulting from these injections have GFP constructs integrated into their genome with variable copy numbers (data not shown). For each construct tested for our experiments, at least three independent PCR-positive tadpoles were examined.XNP(−2.6kb/+20bp) Directs GFP Expression to Retinal PhotoreceptorsWe first produced transgenic tadpoles using the construct containing 2.6 kb of 5′-flanking sequence, XNP(−2.6kb/+20bp)-GFP (Fig. 3). Careful examination of the living tadpoles generally revealed no expression in any nonocular tissue. In one tadpole (out of more than 20 examined), low level GFP expression was observed in pineal gland and olfactory epithelium (data not shown), possibly because of the position effect on the inserted transgene.We sectioned tadpoles carrying this transgene and examined retinal expression. In the phase-contrast images at low magnification (Fig.3 A), the sections of the tadpoles show the structures of the eyes as well as some other body tissues. In the corresponding fluorescence image, GFP expression is observed only in the outer lamina of the retina, with no detectable GFP expression in other retinal cell layers, lens, or nonocular tissues. With higher magnification, it is clear that GFP is expressed in the cell bodies of the photoreceptor cells but not in outer segments of photoreceptor cells or other retinal cells (Fig. 3 A). An image of the retina from a sibling tadpole that did not have the XNP(−2.6kb/+20bp) construct (the PCR-negative tadpole 1, Fig. 2) exhibits only a low level of background autofluorescence at the bottom of the outer segments of the photoreceptor cells, and no detectable GFP is observed in the cell bodies (Fig. 3 A). The tadpole produced using linearized GFP vector with no promoter also does not exhibit any GFP expression in any of the examined tissues (Fig. 3 B) and is identical to the PCR-negative tadpole in Fig. 3 A. This same pattern of very low background autofluorescence right at the inner and outer segment junction is also observed in wild-type embryos (data not shown) and is clearly distinguishable from the GFP fluorescence observed in the transgenic retinas.It is difficult to determine whether all cells in the photoreceptor layer are expressing GFP using traditional microscopy because the cells within the photoreceptor layer are organized in a somewhat staggered p"
https://openalex.org/W1995086523,"pRB family pocket proteins consisting of pRB, p107, and p130 are thought to act as a set of growth regulators that inhibit the cell cycle transition from G1 to S phases by virtue of their interaction with E2F transcription factors. When cells are committed to progressing through the cell cycle at the late G1 restriction point, they are hyperphosphorylated by G1 cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase and are functionally inactivated. Consistent with such a G1regulatory role, pRB and p130 are abundantly expressed in quiescent cells. In contrast, p107 is present at low levels in the hypophosphorylated form in quiescent cells. As cells progress toward late G1 to S phases, the levels of p107 increase, and the majority become hyperphosphorylated, suggesting a possible role of p107 in post-G1 cell cycle regulation. In this study, we have demonstrated that a nonphosphorylatable and thus constitutively active p107 has the potential to inhibit S phase progression. The levels of the phosphorylation-resistant p107 required for the S phase inhibition are significantly less than those of endogenous p107. We further show herein that the exposure of cells to the DNA-damaging agent, cisplatin, provokes S phase arrest, which is concomitantly associated with the accumulation of hypophosphorylated p107. Furthermore, the S phase inhibitory response to cisplatin is augmented by the ectopic expression of wild type p107, although it is diminished by the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein, which counteracts the pocket protein functions. Because p107 is a major pRB family protein expressed in S phase cells, our results indicate that p107 participates in an inhibition of cell cycle progression in response to DNA damage in S phase cells. pRB family pocket proteins consisting of pRB, p107, and p130 are thought to act as a set of growth regulators that inhibit the cell cycle transition from G1 to S phases by virtue of their interaction with E2F transcription factors.

Upon complex formation, pRB family proteins neutralize the transcriptional activities of E2Fs (4Grana X. Garriga J. Mayol X.

Furthermore, the pRB family-E2F complexes appear to also act as E2F site-specific transcriptional repressors (6Dyson N.

Hence, by actively repressing E2F-dependent gene expression, the pRB family proteins prevent cell cycle progression from G1 to S.

Through extensive phosphorylation, the pRB family proteins lose their ability to form complexes with E2Fs, and the released E2Fs initiate S phase entry and subsequent progression (4Grana X.

Accordingly, inactivation of the pRB family proteins appears to be an essential prerequisite for traversing the restriction point. Ectopic expression of pRB family proteins in a variety of cell types gives rise to G1 cell cycle arrest (31Goodrich D.W. Wang N.P. Qian Y.W. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1904-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), supporting their crucial roles in preventing S phase entry. Consistently, pRB and p130 are abundantly expressed in G0/G1-arrested cells in their active, hypophosphorylated forms (4Grana X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 19Beijersbergen R.L. Carlee L. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 237-246PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the p107 protein levels are modulated in an opposing manner. In quiescent cells, p107 protein levels are very low, which is at least in part due to E2F-dependent transcriptional repression of the p107 gene, most probably through the pRB-E2F and/or p130-E2F repressor complex (4Grana X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 37Zhu L. Zhu L. Xie E. Chang L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3552-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As cells progress toward mid-to-late G1, the levels of p107 increase, and in S phase cells p107 becomes a predominant pocket protein, although the majority are hyperphosphorylated and hence inactivated (4Grana X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 19Beijersbergen R.L. Carlee L. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R.

These results indicate that low levels of p107 present during mid-to-late G1 may play an important role in traversing the restriction point in conjunction with other pocket proteins. Alternatively, p107 may play a unique role among the pocket proteins in cells that have already passed the G1 restriction point. We have previously shown that in certain hematopoietic cells, including BaF3 and 32D cells, ectopically expressed p130 inhibits the cell cycle in G1, whereas pRB, even in its phosphorylation-resistant form, fails to do so (34Hoshikawa Y. Mori A. Amimoto K. Iwabe K. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8574-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 38Mori A. Higashi H. Hoshikawa Y. Imamura M. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6209-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Given this observation, we wished to know the role of p107, which is structurally closer to p130 than pRB (4Grana X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), in hematopoietic cell cycle regulation. We therefore generated BaF3 lymphoid cells in which wild type or a nonphosphorylatable and thus constitutively active p107 was inducibly expressed. Here we demonstrate that p107 is capable of inhibiting the S phase cell cycle progression. We further provide evidence that p107 is involved in inhibiting the cell cycle in S phase cells with DNA damage. A p107 mutant, p107ΔS/T-P, that lacks all of the potential phosphorylation sites by cyclin-CDK was generated from human p107 cDNA by multiple rounds of oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis with use of Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions (22Ashizawa S.

In this mutant, threonines 332, 340, 369, 385, 915, and 997 and serines 368, 515, 615, 640, 650, 749, 762, 964, 975, 988, 1009, and 1041 were substituted with alanine residues. Wild type and the phosphorylation-resistant p107 were tagged with influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the carboxyl terminus (p107HA and p107ΔS/T-P-HA). cDNAs encoding p107HA and p107ΔS/T-P-HA were inserted into a mammalian expression vector, pSP65SRα2 (39Shinobu N.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17003-17010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). pOPTET-BSD is an inducible cDNA expression vector having the TcIP promoter and the blasticidin-resistance gene as a drug-selection marker (34Hoshikawa Y.

COS-7 and SAOS-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The 6-1 cell is a BaF3-derived mouse pro-B cell line that stably co-express tTA and LacI (34Hoshikawa Y. Mori A. Amimoto K. Iwabe K. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 20% WEHI-3B-conditioned medium (20% WEHI) as a source of interleukin 3 (IL-3). Stable transfectants that conditionally express p107HA, p107ΔS/T-P-HA, or E1A were created by transfecting pOPTET-BSD-p107HA, pOPTET-BSD-p107ΔS/T-P-HA, or pOPTET-BSD-E1A into 6-1 cells by electroporation as described (34Hoshikawa Y.

Hatakeyama M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6209-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Expression of the cDNA-directed proteins in these transfectants was repressed in medium containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Tc) and was induced in medium containing 5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 24 h in the absence of Tc. COS-7 cells in a 100-mm plate were transfected with 10 μg of each expression plasmid using the DEAE-dextran method. SAOS-2 cells in a 100-mm plate were transfected with 20 μg of each expression plasmid using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method. The transfected cells were harvested 2 days after transfection and lysed in E1A lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml trypsine inhibitor, 0.5 μm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (32Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (12CA5) or anti-adenovirus E1A mouse monoclonal antibody (PharMingen, PM-14161A). Immunoprecipitates were recovered on protein A-Sepharose beads, washed four times with E1A lysis buffer, and eluted by boiling in SDS-containing sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates and lysates were resolved by electrophoresis on a 7.5, 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were transferred to polyvinyldenedifluoride membrane filters (Millipore) as described (42Mizuguchi R. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32297-32303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-HA, anti-p107 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-318), anti-p130 (sc-317), anti-p53 (sc-1314), anti-p21WAF1 (Oncogene Research Products, OP79), anti-cyclin A (sc-751), anti-E2F4 (sc-512), or anti-adenovirus E1A, followed by anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or anti-goat IgG (sc-2020) secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 6-1 cells and their stable transfectants were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended at a density of 4×105/ml with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for cytokine starvation. Cells were then divided into two and cultured with IL-3-depleted medium in the presence of 1 μg/ml Tc or 5 mm IPTG. Following 24 h of culture in the absence of cytokine, cells were restimulated with IL-3 at a final concentration of 200 pg/ml. At 8 h after IL-3 restimulation, cisplatin was added to the culture at a final concentration of 8 μg/ml. Cells were harvested at appropriate time points. For cell cycle synchronization at early S phase, the 6-1-derived transfectant cells were first starved for cytokine and restimulated with IL-3 in the presence of 1 μg/ml Tc as above described. After 4 h of IL-3 restimulation, they were washed twice with PBS, divided into two, and cultured with IL-3-containing medium in the presence of 1 μg/ml Tc or 5 mm IPTG. These cells were respectively treated with hydroxyurea for additional 16 h at a final concentration of 5 mm. The cells were then washed twice with PBS to remove HU and cultured with IL-3-containing medium in the presence of 200 ng/ml nocodazole and 1 μg/ml Tc or 5 mm IPTG. For flow cytometric analysis, harvested cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 80% ethanol on ice. The cells were washed again and resuspended in PBS containing 500 μg/ml RNase A for 20 min at 37 °C. The samples were incubated for another 15 min at 4 ° with propidium iodide solution (100 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate) prior to flow cytometric analysis with a Becton Dickinson FACS Calibur. Cell cycle profiles were determined by use of the CELL Quest and ModFit cell cycle analysis software. 6-1 cell is a BaF3-derived mouse lymphoid cell line whose growth is totally dependent on IL-3, with the depletion of IL-3 24 h from the start of culture inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest (Fig.1 A, 0 h). In these growth-arrested 6-1 cells, a member of pRB family, p130, was abundantly expressed, whereas expression of p107 was very low (Fig. 1 B,lane 1). We have previously shown that the IL-3-dependent growth of the 6-1 cell is inhibited by ectopic expression of p130 but not by pRB, indicating that the cell is actively halted in G0/G1 by the accumulated p130 in the absence of IL-3 and that inactivation of p130 is an essential prerequisite to traversing the G1 restriction point in this cell (34Hoshikawa Y. Mori A. Amimoto K. Iwabe K. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8574-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Restimulation of the growth-arrested 6-1 cells with IL-3 gave rise to synchronized cell cycle reentry and progression from G1 to S phases (Fig. 1 A). At 8 h after IL-3 stimulation, most of the p130 became hyperphosphorylated (Fig. 1 B, lane 2), indicating that by this time G1 cyclin-CDKs were activated sufficiently to phosphorylate and inactivate the pRB family pocket proteins (4Grana X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 19Beijersbergen R.L. Carlee L. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R.

This in turn suggests that most if not all cells passed through the G1 restriction point by 8 h after the IL-3 stimulation. After 16 h, ∼80% of cells entered S phase (Fig. 1 A). By this time point, p130 became barely detectable, whereas p107 was potently induced and abundantly expressed but was hyperphosphorylated (Fig. 1 B,lane 3). 24 h after IL-3 stimulation, the cell cycle profile returned to the pattern that is typical of asynchronously growing cells (Fig. 1 A). Using this cell cycle re-entry/progression protocol, we wished to address the possible role of p107 in cell cycle regulation, particularly in S phase progression. As an initial approach, we generated 6-1-derived stable transfectants, p107-13 and p107-16, that conditionally express wild type p107 (Fig.2 A) with the use of the tetracycline/IPTG dual-regulated inducible system, in which expression of the cDNA is strongly inhibited by tetracycline and is potently activated by IPTG (34Hoshikawa Y. Mori A. Amimoto K. Iwabe K. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8574-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 40Hoshikawa Y. Amimoto K. Mizuguchi R. Hatakeyama M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 272: 22355-22363Google Scholar). However, despite ectopic p107 expression (Fig. 2 B), we were not able to see any changes in the cell cycle entry and progression in response to elevated p107 (Fig.2 C). This may be at least in part due to insufficient expression of ectopic p107, because actively cycling 6-1 cells already express high levels of endogenous p107 (Fig. 1 B). Indeed, we could only increase the p107 levels by at most 2-fold in relation to endogenous levels (Fig. 2 B, compare the expression of total p107 between Tc- and IPTG-treated lanes at the corresponding times). Furthermore, the massive phosphorylation of p107 in response to IL-3 restimulation (Fig. 2 B) indicates that under such circumstances cells possess p107 kinase activity that is sufficient to inactivate both endogenous and exogenous p107. Accordingly, we next generated a phosphorylation-resistant p107 mutant by replacing all of the serine and threonine residues that constitute possible cyclin-CDK phosphorylation motifs (either serine-proline or threonine-proline) with nonphosphorylatable alanine residues (Fig.3 A) (22Ashizawa S. Nishizawa H. Yamada M. Higashi H. Kondo T. Ozawa H. Kakita A. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11362-11370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Upon its transient expression in COS-7 cells, the phosphorylation-resistant p107, p107ΔS/T-P-HA, was detected exclusively in its quickly migrating, hypophosphorylated form (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, it formed physical complexes with endogenous E2F4 and cyclin A in both of COS-7 cells and SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 3 C), indicating that the mutant is biologically active despite multiple point mutations (22Ashizawa S. Nishizawa H. Yamada M. Higashi H. Kondo T. Ozawa H. Kakita A. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11362-11370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding p107ΔS/T-P-HA was introduced into the 6-1 cells and was inducibly expressed in the stable transfectants, PRp107-14 and PRp107-24, with the use of the tetracycline/IPTG dual regulation system (Fig. 4 A). The transfectant clones were first growth-arrested in G0/G1 by IL-3 deprivation for 24 h. During IL-3 starvation, cells were also treated with Tc or IPTG. Upon IPTG treatment, the phosphorylation-resistant p107ΔS/T-P-HA was expressed in the growth-arrested cells (Fig. 4 B, lane 3), whereas it was undetectable in the same transfectant that was treated with Tc (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). Restimulation of the G0/G1 arrest cells with IL-3 in the presence of Tc (i.e. the uninduced condition) gave rise to a cell cycle progression that is basically indistinguishable from that observed with the parental 6-1 cells (Fig. 4 C, Tc; see also Fig. 1 A). In striking contrast, the same cells inducibly expressing p107ΔS/T-P-HA exhibited a severe delay of S phase entry and progression, despite the continued presence of IL-3 for 48 h (Fig. 4, C and D). To investigate the S phase inhibitory activity of the phosphorylation-resistant p107 more directly, we examined the effect of p107ΔS/T-P-HA in cells synchronized in the early S phase (Fig.5 A). G0/G1-arrested PRp107-24 cells were restimulated with IL-3 and, at 4 h after the IL-3 restimulation, the DNA synthesis inhibitor HU was added to the culture at a final concentration of 5 mm. At this time, IPTG was also added to the culture to induce p107ΔS/T-P-HA. Because these cells pass through the G1 restriction point by 8 h after the onset of IL-3 restimulation and 4 h of IPTG induction is too short to induce p107ΔS/T-P-HA protein in cells, 2T. Kondo, and M. Hatakeyama, unpublished observations. the HU-treated cells were expected to traverse from G1 to S without receiving the effect of the phosphorylation-resistant p107. The cells were treated with HU and IPTG for 16 h to induce sufficient amounts of p107ΔS/T-P-HA while arrested in the early S phase. As expected, in these HU-blocked cells, endogenous p107 molecules were totally hyperphosphorylated (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2 and4). Furthermore, the cells expressed p107ΔS/T-P-HA, whose levels were not increased by further incubation with IPTG (Fig.5 B, lanes 4 and 5). The early S phase-synchronized cells were then released from the HU block, and subsequent cell cycle progression was monitored by flow cytometry in the presence of 200 ng/ml of the tubulin inhibitor nocodazole to prevent entry into the next cell cycle. In the control cells in which expression of p107ΔS/T-P-HA was not induced, DNA synthesis was rapidly initiated upon HU release, and completion of full genome replication occurred within 18 h after the release (Fig.5 C). In striking contrast, in the presence of p107ΔS/T-P-HA, DNA synthesis was severely impaired, and most cells failed to achieve replication of full genome as late as 24 h (Fig.5 C). These results clearly demonstrate that the phosphorylation-resistant p107 is capable of inhibiting progression of the S phase. It should be noted, however, that the cells were obviously capable of initiating some degree of DNA synthesis in the presence of p107ΔS/T-P-HA, although they failed to complete genome replication (Fig. 5 C). This may indicate that chain elongation can still take place in the presence of the phosphorylation-resistant p107. Although the phosphorylation-resistant p107 is capable of inhibiting S phase progression, it remains possible that the S phase inhibitory effect is due to supraphysiologic levels of the protein expressed. To address this possibility, we examined the expression levels of the p107 mutant. Because p107ΔS/T-P-HA is detectable exclusively in its hypophosphorylated form, it is possible to compare expression levels between endogenous p107 and p107ΔS/T-P-HA. In the IPTG-treated PRp107-24 cells wherein p107ΔS/T-P-HA was inducibly expressed (Figs.4 B, lanes 3–6, and 5 B, lanes 4 and 5) and cell cycle progr"
https://openalex.org/W2055270265,"d-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli contains two Gly-Gly sequences that occur at junctions between domains. A previous study (Grant, G. A., Xu, X. L., and Hu, Z. (2000)Biochemistry 39, 7316–7319) determined that the Gly-Gly sequence at the junction between the regulatory and substrate binding domain functions as a hinge between the domains. Mutations in this area significantly decrease the ability of serine to inhibit activity but have little effect on the Km andkcat. Conversely, the present study shows that mutations to the Gly-Gly sequence at the junction of the substrate and nucleotide binding domains, which form the active site cleft, have a significant effect on the kcat of the enzyme without substantially altering the enzyme's sensitivity to serine. In addition, mutation of Gly-294, but not Gly-295, has a profound effect on the cooperativity of serine inhibition. Interestingly, even though cooperativity of inhibition can be reduced significantly, there is little apparent effect on the cooperativity of serine binding itself. An additional mutant, G336V,G337V, also reduces the cooperativity of inhibition, but in this case serine binding also is reduced to the point at which it cannot be measured by equilibrium dialysis. The double mutant G294V,G336V demonstrates that strain imposed by mutation at one hinge can be relieved partially by mutation at the other hinge, demonstrating linkage between the two hinge regions. These data show that the two cooperative processes, serine binding and catalytic inhibition, can be uncoupled. Consideration of the allowable torsional angles for the side chains introduced by the mutations yields a range of values for these angles that the glycine residues likely occupy in the native enzyme. A comparison of these values with the torsional angles found for the inhibited enzyme from crystal coordinates provides potential beginning and ending orientations for the transition from active to inhibited enzyme, which will allow modeling of the dynamics of domain movement. d-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli contains two Gly-Gly sequences that occur at junctions between domains.

Grant G.A. Banaszak L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the enzymatic activity of which is regulated in an allosteric manner byl-serine, the end product of its metabolic pathway (2Sugimoto E.

Each subunit contains three distinct domains that can be visualized easily in the crystal structure (1Schuller D. Grant G.A. Banaszak L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These are referred to as the regulatory (or serine binding), substrate binding, and nucleotide binding domains (Fig. 1). The binding sites for the substrate and the effector are formed by amino acid residues at the interfaces between domains (1Schuller D. Grant G.A. Banaszak L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In both cases, hydrogen bonds are formed between the ligands and both domains forming the interface. Serine binds at the two interfaces formed by adjacent regulatory domains, forming intersubunit hydrogen bonds at these sites. The four active sites are formed by the juncture of the substrate binding domain and the nucleotide binding domain. The substrate interacts with adjacent domains within a subunit but also with residues in the adjacent subunit. A consequence of this configuration is that a single serine molecule makes contact with two subunits, each having an active site, and potentially each is affected directly by the single serine. Also as a consequence of this configuration, two separate cooperative effects are possible and are seen in the native enzyme. These are cooperativity in serine binding itself (5Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2501-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and cooperativity of inhibition as a result of serine binding (2Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol.

The regulatory domain is linked to the substrate binding domain by a single strand of polypeptide that contains a Gly-Gly sequence approximately midway between the two domains. The function of this Gly-Gly sequence has been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis (7Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the data are consistent with its functioning as a hinge region between the two domains. Mutations at this hinge affect sensitivity to serine without appreciably affecting catalytic activity (see TableI).Table IKinetic and inhibition parametersMutantResidue numberKmVmaxkcatkcat/KmIC50SerHill coefficientmmμms−1s−1s−1m−1μmn293 294 295 296 336 3374C/AI G G S G G0.6 ± 0.1428.9 ± 3.929.04.8 × 104102.02 ± 0.07G294AI A G S G G0.85 ± 0.0923.4 ± 0.910.81.3 × 10481.82 ± 0.10G294VI V G S G G0.77 ± 0.0719.0 ± 0.60.0791.0 × 102151.08 ± 0.04G295AI G A S G G1.2 ± 0.0643.6 ± 1.023.42.0 × 10482.15 ± 0.13G295VI G V S G G0.58 ± 0.047.2 ± 0.20.0213.6 × 101152.11 ± 0.20G294V,G295VI V V S G G0.9 ± 0.1616.8 ± 1.20.0222.4 × 101231.28 ± 0.24I293G,G295VG G V S G G0.49 ± 0.00418.8 ± 0.050.244.9 × 10291.87 ± 0.09G294V,S296GI V G G G G0.48 ± 0.0214.2 ± 0.20.091.9 × 102201.11 ± 0.07G294V,G336VI V G S V G0.08 ± 0.015.8 ± 0.090.0486.0 × 102751.36 ± 0.07G336VaOriginally reported in Ref.7.I G G S V G0.25 ± 0.0521.1 ± 0.719.07.6 × 1041421.82 ± 0.09G337VaOriginally reported in Ref.7.I G G S G V0.15 ± 0.0229.6 ± 0.76.94.6 × 104152.24 ± 0.14G336V,G337VaOriginally reported in Ref.7.I G G S V V0.10 ± 0.0221.5 ± 0.79.09.0 × 1048001.20 ± 0.05a Originally reported in Ref.7Grant G.A.

Open table in a new tab In a similar manner, the substrate binding domain is linked to the nucleotide binding domain by two strands of polypeptide, one of which contains the only other Gly-Gly sequence in the enzyme. This linkage also comprises the locus at which the substrate binding domain and the nucleotide binding domain join to form the active site cleft. Amino acid residues within the active site cleft that seem to play a role in substrate binding and potentially in the regulation of the enzymatic activity have been identified previously (8Grant G.A. Kim S.J. Xu X.L. Hu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5357-5361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In order for the active site to close around the substrate during catalysis, it would seem that some flexibility is required in the vicinity of this Gly-Gly sequence. This study explores the role of this area as a potential hinge region for the functioning of PGDH and reveals its role in the cooperativity of serine inhibition. Mutants of PGDH were produced, expressed in E. coli, and isolated as described previously (6Al-Rabiee R. Lee E.J. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13013-13017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Schuller D.J. Fetter C.H. Banaszak L.J. Grant G.A. J. Biol.

Catalytic activity was determined at 25° in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, using α-ketoglutarate as the substrate, and by monitoring the decrease in absorbance of NADH at 340 nm (10Zhao G. Winkler M.E.

Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method as described previously (12Grant G.A. Xu X.L. J. Biol.

All mutations are constructed in PGDH4C/A, a form of the enzyme where the four native cysteine residues in each subunit have been converted to alanine (12Grant G.A. Xu X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22389-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The IC50 value forl-serine is the concentration of serine that produces a 50% inhibition of the enzyme activity. Kinetic parameters were determined either using direct linear plots (14Henderson P.J.F. Eisenthal R. Danson M.J. Enzyme Assays: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1992: 284-285Google Scholar) or by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menton equation with Kaleidograph (Synergy Software). Enzyme homogeneity was judged by SDS gels.

All mutants in this study maintained an emission maximum at 340 nm and retained their ability to bind serine, indicating an intact association of subunits. Equilibrium dialysis was performed in 500-μl dialysis cartridges obtained from Sialomed, Inc. (Columbia, MD). Dialysis was performed for 16 h with l-[3H]serine as a tracer in appropriate concentrations of unlabeled l-serine. Cells were sampled in triplicate, and the average of 10-min counts was used to calculate concentrations of free and boundl-serine. The nominal PGDH concentration was 5 μm tetramer in all binding experiments. Serine inhibition plots were fit to the Hill equation Y= [L]n/K + [L]n(17Bell J.E. Bell E.T. Proteins and Enzymes. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey1988: 465-470Google Scholar), where Y is the fractional inhibition, [L] is the concentration of ligand, n is the Hill coefficient, and K is the Hill constant. Serine binding data were fit to the Adair equation (17Bell J.E. Bell E.T. Proteins and Enzymes. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey1988: 465-470Google Scholar) for either four sitesY=(L/K1)+(2L2/K1K2)+(3L3/K1K2K3)+(4L4/K1K2K3K4)4(1+(L/K1)+(L2/K1K2)+(L3/K1K2K3)+(L4/K1K2K3K4))Equation 1 or two sitesY=(L/K1)+(2L2/K1K2)2(1+(L/K1)+(L2/K1K2))Equation 2 where Y is the fractional occupancy, L is the free ligand concentration, and Ki are the stepwise Adair constants. Data were fit also to the equation for equivalent independent binding sites, r = (p[L])/(Kd + [L]), where r is moles of ligand bound/mole of acceptor, [L] is the free ligand concentration, andp is the number of binding sites. Fitting was performed using Kaleidograph (Synergy Software). Intrinsic site dissociation constants were calculated from the Adair constants using the following statistical relationships for a molecule, where n sites are occupied at maximal binding, and Ki′ values are the intrinsic dissociation constants (17Bell J.E.

R is the universal Gas constant, and T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin. The coupling or interaction energy, ΔΔGINT, is defined in terms of the respective ΔΔGs as follows.ΔΔGINT=ΔΔG12−ΔΔG1=ΔΔG21−ΔΔG2Equation 8 If the two positions do not interact, the differences in ΔΔG will be zero. On the other hand, if they do interact, the differences in ΔΔG will be non-zero, and ΔΔGINT will have a non-zero value. In this study, interaction with respect to the active site is analyzed using the overall rate constantkcat/Km (18Ackers G.K. Smith F, R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 597-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and interaction with respect to the serine binding site is analyzed using the IC50 value as a global approximation of the overall binding of serine. Fig. 2 shows the location of the Gly-Gly sequence at the active site of PGDH in relation to His-292 and NADH, which participate in the proton and hydride transfer during catalysis. The active site cleft lies to the left of the arc made by the polypeptide chain. There do not seem to be any hydrogen bonding contacts made between this segment of polypeptide with other segments of the enzyme. Note that the structure shown is derived from the inhibited enzyme so that hydrogen bonding in this area may be different in the active enzyme. Fig. 3 shows an α-carbon tracing of a subunit of PGDH with the approximate location of the two Gly-Gly sequences noted above. Gly-294 and Gly-295 lie at one end of an α-helix extending to Gly-336 and Gly-337. Thus, this helix is a potential route for the transmission of conformational information from the regulatory domain to the active site. A previous report (7Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) explored the role of Gly-336 and Gly-337 by producing mutants with side chains of increasing bulk at these positions. The effect of removing bulky side chains from flanking positions was investigated also. A similar strategy is used in these studies. The kinetic results (Table I) show that the ability of serine to inhibit catalytic activity varies by no more than 2-fold in mutants not involving Gly-336 or Gly-337. On the other hand, kcat/Km values are affected by as much as three orders of magnitude with the largest effect seen with respect to kcat. Replacement of the glycine residues at either position 294 or 295 with alanine only has a minimal effect. A major effect on the kinetic parameters is not evident until either glycine residue is replaced with a valine side chain. In both cases, the effect is primarily on thekcat of the enzyme. Shifting the Gly-Gly sequence one position to the left, while maintaining a valine at position 295 (I293G/G295V), seems to result in an approximately one order of magnitude increase inkcat/Km compared with the mutants containing only a single glycine residue. A similar shift to the right (G294V/S296G) has little effect. Interestingly, an inspection of the Hill coefficients shows that mutation of Gly-294 has a substantial effect on the cooperativity of the inhibition by l-serine. In all cases where the addition of a side chain at position 294 produces a significant effect on thekcat, it also decreases the Hill coefficient of the inhibition curve from ∼2 to values close to 1 (G294V, G294V/S296G, and G294V/G295V). A similar effect is not evident when comparable mutations are performed at position 295 (G295V and I293G/G295V). Both G294V and G295V mutants significantly reducekcat/Km values, but only G294V reduces the Hill coefficient. Representative inhibition curves, illustrating the loss in sigmoidicity for G294V, are shown in Fig.4. A direct analysis of l-serine binding by equilibrium dialysis was performed to look at the effect of mutating Gly-294 on serine binding (Fig. 5). The binding data show that a maximum of two sites are occupied fully with the possibility of partial occupancy of a third site. However, the appearance of partial occupancy of the third site is very sensitive to the quantitation of the enzyme and remains in question. This binding behavior is very similar to that reported previously for the native enzyme (5Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2501-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The data were analyzed by fitting to the Adair equation for either two or four sites and to the equation for equivalent independent sites using either two- or three-site potential occupancy. The intrinsic binding constants derived from these fitting procedures are presented in Table II along with the fitting statistics. Both visually and statistically, the best fit is to the Adair equation, which allows for the analysis of dependent binding sites. The fits for the two- and four-site Adair equations yield similar results. The graphical analysis for the four-site Adair equation is shown in Fig. 5. The derived intrinsic dissociation constants indicate an element of positive cooperativity in the binding of the first two ligand molecules. The χ2 value of 0.03 for the fit to the Adair equation indicates a significantly better fit than the values of 2.2 and 1.5 for the fits for equivalent independent sites. In addition, the residuals for the fit to the Adair equation are much smaller and more consistently dispersed than for the other fits. The intrinsic dissociation constants derived from the Adair equation are 45, 6, and 69 μm, which are comparable with that of 213, 4, and 56 μm determined for the native enzyme (5Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2501-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). If anything, the extent of positive cooperativity may have decreased a little for G294V, but significant positive cooperativity still exists with an almost 8-fold decrease in the dissociation constant for the second site to bind ligand.Table IIAnalysis of binding data for G294VAdair equation, 4 sitesAdair equation, 2 sites2 independent sites3 independent sitesμmK115.1 ± 5.237.6 ± 178.2 ± 0.820.9 ± 1.1K25.9 ± 2.42.0 ± 0.9K3208 ± 134K4Very largeK1′4575821K2′61K3′69K4′Very largeRaFitting statistics:R is the correlation coefficient, and χ2 (Chi square) represents the accumulated deviation between the data and the calculated curves.0.987890.990380.949450.96718χ2aFitting statistics:R is the correlation coefficient, and χ2 (Chi square) represents the accumulated deviation between the data and the calculated curves.0.0340460.10802.22121.5168Binding data for G294V are expressed as dissociation constants.

Our previous study (7Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) of the Gly-Gly pair linking the regulatory domain to the substrate binding domain indicated that only Gly-336 exhibited an effect when bulky side chains were placed at this position. In this case, G336V (Table I) decreased sensitivity to serine without affecting the kinetic parameters or the Hill coefficient. The effect of this substitution in conjunction with the Gly-294 mutant was tested by analyzing the double mutant G294V,G336V. Interestingly, the value of kcat/Km and the sensitivity to serine are intermediate between those for G294V and G336V alone. Serine binding analysis of the G294V,G336V mutant shows very clearly the sigmoidal nature of the binding curve (Fig.6) even though the Hill coefficient for inhibition has been reduced to near 1 (1.13). As reported previously, the serine sensitivity of G336V, G337V is decreased substantially, but there is essentially no effect onkcat/Km. High concentrations of serine are still capable of inhibiting the enzyme, but now this mutant also reduces the Hill coefficient for inhibition to near 1. Appreciable serine binding is not measurable by equilibrium dialysis analysis (data not shown) and indicates that the primary effect of the G336V,G337V mutations is on the ability of the enzyme to bind serine. The double mutants were subjected to thermodynamic linkage analysis (Table III) to judge the degree of interaction between the residue pairs. Gly-294 and Gly-295 display a large degree of linkage for the active site but no linkage at all for the serine binding sites. On the other hand, Gly-336 and Gly-337 display linkage for the serine binding sites but essentially none for the active site. Gly-294 and Gly-336 display intermediate levels of linkage for both sites but with opposite signs, reflecting the improvement in kinetic parameters and the increased sensitivity to serine.Table IIIThermodynamic linkage analysisMutantsΔΔGINTkcat/KmIC50kcal mol−1G294V,G295V−3.40G294V,G336V−1.21.0G336V,G337V−0.1−0.8 Open table in a new tab This paper is the second in the investigation of the role of the Gly-Gly sequences found at the junctions of the domains of PGDH.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) showed that in the case of the mutation of Gly-336 and Gly-337, the value forkcat/Km remained near that of the native enzyme for all mutations studied. However, the ability of serine to inhibit the enzyme was decreased by as much as 350-fold (7Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) for some mutants. For mutation of Gly-294 and Gly-295, the opposite effect is observed (Table I). That is, large differences inkcat are seen without appreciable effects on the enzymes sensitivity to serine. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the link between the regulatory and substrate binding domains is functional in linking serine binding to active site inhibition, whereas the link between the substrate and nucleotide binding domains is functional in the dynamics of catalysis. In the previous study, the decrease in serine sensitivity produced by adding a bulky side chain to position 336, or both 336 and 337, could be relieved completely by placing a glycine at the flanking position 335 (7Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, the new glycine seemed to relieve the effect of the mutation by providing a new hinge point in the connecting segment. A similar reversal of mutational effect, but to a less significant degree (only ∼10×), is seen by placing a glycine residue at position 293 when position 295 is a valine. This suggests that if rotational freedom is critical at this locus, it is accommodated more narrowly. However, this remains a likely interpretation because no obvious steric interference of the mutant residue with a neighboring structure is evident from the crystal structure. The data also indicate clearly that Gly-294 is critical for the cooperativity of l-serine inhibition, an observation that is seen consistently throughout the mutants studied. Whenever a bulky side chain is placed at this position, the Hill coefficient is decreased substantially to a value near 1. This appears to be a function of the bulk of the side chain rather than just the absence of glycine because the effect is not seen when Gly-294 is converted to an alanine. Interestingly, although a mutation at Gly-294 reduces cooperativity in serine inhibition, it seems to have only a minimal effect on the cooperativity of serine binding to the enzyme. The best fit to the data for G294V is produced by the Adair equation and indicates that the binding sites for serine are not independent. Although the sigmoidal shape of the binding curve for G294V is not pronounced, it is evident. This conclusion is substantiated by the observation that the sigmoidal nature of the binding curve for the G294V,G336V mutant is especially pronounced, and it also produces a Hill coefficient for binding near 1. For G294V, an apparent reduction in the first intrinsic dissociation constant is seen relative to the unmutated form, but the general characteristics of substantial positive cooperativity in the binding of the second ligand and general lack of binding to the fourth and perhaps the third site are still apparent. For G294V,G336V, the first intrinsic dissociation constant is on the order of 500 μm, whereas the second is ∼8 μm, again reflecting significant positive cooperativity. Hence, placing a bulky side chain at position 294 seems to uncouple the two cooperative processes effectively. Classically, allosteric proteins have been viewed globally as being in either one state or another. Thus, one might assume that when two processes are affected by the same stimulus (serine binding) they both should be affected equally. This may be true for native enzyme, but when mutations are introduced at specific structural loci, the potential for splitting transmission to distant points on the structure exists. Thus, such uncoupling of cooperative effects should be possible theoretically if the end point for each is not along the same conformational pathway. In this case, serine binding directly affects two separate structural loci on the tetrameric protein. These are the other serine binding sites located at the two regulatory domain interfaces on the one hand and the catalytic sites located between the substrate binding domain and nucleotide binding domain on the other. Because these functionally different sites are located spatially apart on the protein, the pathway of conformational transduction from the first serine binding event to each of them must diverge structurally at some point. If a mutation such as G294V is located past the point of divergence but before one of these loci (i.e. the catalytic site), it seems reasonable that the mutant could affect cooperativity at that site to a much greater extent than at the other site, the transduction pathway of which has not been altered. The data presented here suggest that this is the case. A similar effect on cooperativity is not seen with a mutation at Gly-295. Although a valine at position 295 decreases thekcat even more than Gly-294 (by an additional 4-fold), no change in the cooperativity of inhibition occurs. A reason for this lack of change is not suggested immediately by the inhibited structure, although it is noted that Gly-294 is spatially between Gly-295 and the His-292/Pro-291/Trp-139′ cluster (see Fig. 2), which has been suggested (8Grant G.A. Kim S.J. Xu X.L. Hu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5357-5361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as a possible locus for direct interaction of the active site residues with the adjacent subunit. Trp-139′ from the adjacent subunit inserts into a hydrophobic pocket at the base of His-292, the catalytic histidine. Mutation of Trp-139′ to smaller side chains also has a substantial effect on the cooperativity ofl-serine inhibition. Gly-294 is only two residues removed from His-292 and three residues from Pro-291, which forms part of the Trp-139′ pocket and is only ∼3.6 Å from the indole face of the tryptophan side chain in the adjacent subunit. Thus, Gly-294 is in an ideal position to affect not only the position of a critical catalytic residue but also the direct interaction between residues from two adjacent subunits. This is consistent with both the decrease in catalytic efficiency as well as the decrease in cooperativity that is seen experimentally. Although the mutant G294V,G336V also produces a Hill coefficient near 1, the values for kcat/Km and serine inhibition (IC50) are intermediate between those for G294V and G336V. This indicates that a mutation in one area can affect the other area, as born out in the linkage analysis shown in Table III. The opposite signs of the ΔΔGINT for kinetic and serine binding parameters indicate a favorable outcome for both functionalities, thus confirming that the effects can travel in both directions. That is, a mutation at the catalytic site can relieve strain at the serine binding sites caused by a mutation in that region and vice versa. Because the addition of side chains at the glycine positions would have the effect of restricting rotation about the bonds described by the Φ and Ψ angles of these residues, these two pairs of glycine residues seem to function as rotational hinges in the dynamics of catalysis and inhibition. The Φ and Ψ angles for the glycine residues in the two Gly-Gly pairs are shown in the Ramachandran plots in Fig.7. Keep in mind that these angles are for the inhibited enzyme; the angles found in the native enzyme are not known. However, the mutation data can be used to give an indication of what the ranges may be for the active enzyme. If a mutation has no effect on a particular function, then it can be assumed that the Φ and Ψ angles of the active enzyme are likely within the areas allowed for the side chain placed at that position. If a mutation negatively affects a particular function, then the assumption is that the Φ and Ψ angles of the fully active enzyme are not within the allowed regions for that side chain. One must keep in mind that these allowed regions are only approximate because the allowed Ramachandran angles were determined with rigid-sphere models, and there are many examples of structures in which residues apparently occupy forbidden space (20Vega M.C. Martinez J.C. Serrano L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2322-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Φ and Ψ angles for Gly-294, -295, -336, and -337 in the inhibited enzyme place all these residues in or very close to (Gly-294) the allowed regions for glycine residues. However, Gly-294 and Gly-336 are outside the allowed areas for alanine and valine. These are also the two residues that when mutated produce the most profound effects on serine sensitivity and the cooperativity of serine inhibition. When Gly-294 or Gly-295 are converted to alanine there essentially is no change in activity or serine binding, but conversion to valine significantly reduces kcat/Kmfor both. Therefore, in the active enzyme both of these residues likely have Φ and Ψ angles within the region allowable for alanine. When serine inhibits the enzyme, the Φ and Ψ angles for Gly-295 are still within this region, but those for Gly-294 are well outside this region, suggesting that serine binding causes a significant rotation at this residue. When Gly-336 is converted to alanine or valine (Ref. 7Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and Table I) the IC50 values for serine increase ∼4- and 14-fold, respectively. Therefore, the values for the active enzyme for position 336 are likely outside of the areas allowed for alanine and valine because they are in the inhibited enzyme. There is no change in IC50 for the mutation of Gly-337, and so the Φ and Ψ angles for this position in the active enzyme are likely also to be within the areas allowed for valine. In the inhibited enzyme, Gly-337 lies within the area allowed for alanine but not for valine, suggesting a small shift during inhibition. Based on these data, it is possible to deduce a likely range of values for the Φ and Ψ angles at these hinge positions in the active enzyme, and by comparing that to the Φ and Ψ angles observed in the inhibited enzyme, we can start to address what happens to the relative positions of the subunit domains during this transition. Modeling this transition will not be trivial, however, and is well outside the scope of this study. Potential compensation by rotations of other residues will have to be taken into account as well as accommodating any domain motion within the context of maintaining the tetramer contacts. The role of Gly-294 and that of the combination of Gly-336 and Gly-337 in the cooperativity of serine inhibition are particularly intriguing. We have shown previously (21Grant G.A. Hu Z. Xu X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1078-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that mutations at the interface between the regulatory and substrate binding domains can decrease the cooperativity of serine inhibition while at the same time increasing the sensitivity of the enzyme to being inhibited by serine. This suggests that each active site is affected by serine binding to its own subunit in a noncooperative manner and that additional interaction between domains propagates the cooperative effect. When Gly-294 is converted to valine, it seems serine binding can affect its torsional angles to the extent of producing inhibition, but the torsional angles are not changed to the extent that they will propagate the cooperativity. When both Gly-336 and Gly-337 are converted to valine, not only is serine binding significantly decreased, but so is the cooperativity of remaining inhibition. This is similar to the effect seen when the regulatory/substrate binding domain interface residues themselves are altered (21Grant G.A. Hu Z. Xu X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1078-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, the common effect of these two different mutants, reducing cooperativity of inhibition, seems to come about for two different reasons. G336V,G337V most likely is not able to produce the domain interface contacts to sufficiently alter the torsional angles of Gly-294 required for cooperativity between subunits. On the other hand, G294V is most likely sterically restrained from achieving the necessary torsional angle transition for the cooperative effect. The observation that cooperativity of inhibition can be uncoupled from cooperativity of effector binding underscores the concept that the two processes occur by distinct pathways initiated by a common event. Furthermore, there is clearly linkage between these two areas. The degree to which the two pathways share common features and the nature of their linkage in the native enzyme can now begin to be addressed.

https://openalex.org/W1487094136,"Understanding mechanisms in cooperative proteins requires the analysis of the intermediate ligation states. The release of hydrogen ions at the intermediate states of native and chemically modified hemoglobin, known as the Bohr effect, is an indicator of the protein tertiary/quaternary transitions, useful for testing models of cooperativity. The Bohr effects due to ligation of one subunit of a dimer and two subunits across the dimer interface are not additive. The reductions of the Bohr effect due to the chemical modification of a Bohr group of one and two α or β subunits are additive. The Bohr effects of monoliganded chemically modified hemoglobins indicate the additivity of the effects of ligation and chemical modification with the possible exception of ligation and chemical modification of the α subunits. These observations suggest that ligation of a subunit brings about a tertiary structure change of hemoglobin in the T quaternary structure, which breaks some salt bridges, releases hydrogen ions, and is signaled across the dimer interface in such a way that ligation of a second subunit in the adjacent dimer promotes the switch from the T to the R quaternary structure. The rupture of the salt bridges per se does not drive the transition."

Proliferation is limited to the crypts of Lieberkühn, where multipotent stem cells achieve continuous renewal of four main epithelial lineages. At the top of the crypt, cells lose their proliferative ability and complete differentiation during a highly organized migration along the crypt-villus axis. Enterocytes, mucus-producing goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells evolve during a vertical migration to the villus apex (1Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J.

This process requires 4 to 5 days and results in well-differentiated cells that are finally released into the intestinal lumen upon programmed cell death. In contrast, Paneth cells undergo terminal differentiation while moving down to the base of the crypt (4Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J.

Most of the previous studies were performed with enterocytes (95% of differentiated cells of the villus) and have essentially described the specific expression of genes contributing to the morphological and functional phenotype of mature cells.

Fetal bovine serum was increased up to 20%, and nonessential amino acids (0.1 mm) were added to the culture medium of Caco-2 cells.

Guinea pig intestinal cDNA library was constructed in λZAP II vector using 5 μg of polyadenylated RNA from differentiated villus enterocytes according to the instructions of the manufacturer (ZAP cDNA synthesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The library was packaged into phage particles using the Gigapack II system (Stratagene) and amplified once in XL1-Blue MRF' Escherichia coli (Stratagene). For immunological screening, the nitrocellulose filters were probed with anti-phospholipase B antiserum (18Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama A. Collet X. Nauze M. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and then probed with an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin-G antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. Positive plaques were purified by three runs and recovered as Bluescript plasmids by in vivo excision using ExAssist helper phage (Stratagene). For DNA screening, the library was plated on XL1-Blue MRF' E. coli, and replicas on nylon membranes (Hybond N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were prepared. Phage DNA was denatured (1.5m NaCl, 0.5 m NaOH) and cross-linked to the membrane by exposure to UV. The 9D1 PstI fragment was used as a probe for hybridization as described previously (19Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama-Diagne A. Nauze M. Ragab A. Li R.Y. Capdevielle J. Ferrara P. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13407-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Positive clones were purified through three runs and recovered as Bluescript plasmids by in vivo excision using ExAssist helper phage and SOLR E. coli (Stratagene). Enterophilin-1 probe (850 bp1) was obtained by digestion of the 3.9D1 clone with EcoRI/XhoI. Phospholipase B probe is a 386-bp fragment amplified by polymerase chain reaction (19Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama-Diagne A. Nauze M. Ragab A. Li R.Y. Capdevielle J. Ferrara P. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13407-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (350 bp) was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using human lung cDNA as a template (44Arcari P. Martinelli R. Salvatore F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9179-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The probes were labeled by random primer extension using the Nonaprimer Kit (Appligene Oncor) and [α-32P]dCTP from Amersham. RNA electrophoresis and filter hybridization were performed as described previously (19Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama-Diagne A. Nauze M. Ragab A. Li R.Y. Capdevielle J. Ferrara P. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13407-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The pBluescript-3.9D1 clone containing the full-length cDNA of enterophilin-1 was used as a template for these constructions. pCI-Ent1 was obtained by digestion of pBluescript-3.9D1 with XbaI andKpnI, and the insert was ligated in pCI (Promega) previously digested with NheI and KpnI. To generate pGFP-Ent1 and pcDNA3-Ent1, double digestions were achieved withPstI/KpnI and NotI/HindIII, and the insert cDNAs were ligated respectively in pGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) and pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen) at the corresponding sites. We generated enterophilin-1 in frame with the carboxyl terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and carboxyl-terminal c-myc and polyhistidine tag. COS-7 or HT-29 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes or 6-well plates and transiently transfected with the different plasmids using a cationic lipid (LipofectAMINE; Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For transfection experiments with the GFP fusion constructs, COS-7 cells were grown on sterile glass coverslips placed in 35-mm culture plates and fixed as described previously (45Raynal P. Van Bergen en Henegouwen P. Hullin F. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Fauvel J. Verkleij A. Chap H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was visualized at 65 h with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope at a magnification of ×40. The pBluescript-3.9D1 plasmid was digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and the obtained fragment (residues 336–529) corresponding to the 3′ region of enterophilin-1 cDNA (B30.2 domain) was inserted into pGEX-KG vector (a gift of Dr. J. E. Dixon, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI). This construction was introduced into E. coli strain XL1-Blue, and production of the fusion protein was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions according to Laemmli (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) and Coomassie Blue staining, the 55-kDa band corresponding to the GST-B30.2 domain fusion protein was used to immunize a New Zealand white rabbit. The antiserum was purified by a two-step procedure, including preadsorption on GST bound to glutathione-agarose beads, followed by adsorption of the subsequent supernatant on GST-B30.2 fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads. The specific anti-B30.2 antibody was eluted by acidification with 0.1 m citric acid, pH 2.7, and immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 11.0. The purified antibody was desalted and used for immunoblotting. A rabbit polyclonal anti-peptide antibody was produced by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) using a peptide of 16 residues (CQTERDKLRQEIDDRK) corresponding to amino acids 313–328 of enterophilin-1 (Fig. 1), where the amino-terminal leucine was replaced by a cysteine to allow conjugation to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier. All the procedures described were performed at 4 °C. Nine fractions of guinea pig enterocytes were isolated according to Weiser (42Weiser M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2536-2541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), washed twice in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm leupeptin, and then disrupted by 10 strokes with a Potter homogenizer. Caco-2 cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA either at confluence (mainly undifferentiated cells) or at various times (up to 23 days) after reaching confluence (differentiated cells). They were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mmleupeptin). Nuclei were isolated as described previously (47Stott D. Murray E.J. Methods in Molecular Biology. 7. Human Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1991: 327-335Google Scholar). Briefly, washed cells (about 108 cells) were gently suspended in hypotonic buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. They were incubated on ice for 10 min, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 × g. They were then washed twice with hypotonic buffer without detergent and then suspended in the same buffer. Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (48Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). Protein samples were submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes according to standard protocol (49Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5915) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody against β-actin was from Sigma. Anti-villin antibody was from Affiniti, and anti-lamin B was from Nova Castra Laboratories. HT-29 cells were transfected as described previously and maintained in the presence of serum. [3H]Thymidine (0.5 μCi/ml) was added to the cells at 24, 48, or 72 h after transfection, and incubation was prolonged for 4 h. Cells were washed twice in PBS, and 5% trichloroacetic acid was added for 10 min at room temperature. The solution was withdrawn, and solubilization was performed at room temperature with 0.5 m NaOH for at least 30 min. Radioactivity in cell lysates was measured by liquid scintillation counting (1900 TR; Packard). Caco-2 or transfected HT-29 cells were scraped in PBS and sonicated, and the homogenates were incubated in the presence of saccharose orp-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrates according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemical). Data are expressed in IU (micromole of substrate hydrolyzed per minute) per gram of protein. Cell proteins were determined according to the method of Bradford (48Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). A λZAP II guinea pig intestinal cDNA library was constructed and screened using a polyclonal antibody raised against phospholipase B (18Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama A. Collet X. Nauze M. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama-Diagne A. Nauze M. Ragab A. Li R.Y. Capdevielle J. Ferrara P. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13407-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Three identical positive clones (7D1, 8D1, and 9D1) carrying 1.5-kb insertions were isolated and sequenced. Because none of them apparently contained an ATG initiation codon, isolation of the full-length cDNA was attempted using the PstI 1,100-bp fragment of 9D1 as a probe. Seven positive clones were selected and sequenced. Among them, 3.9D1 corresponded to a complete nucleotide sequence of 1999 bp. The open reading frame designed according to Kozak (50Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3589) Google Scholar) included 1,587 nucleotides (positions 142–1728) and encoded a 64.5-kDa protein consisting of 529 amino acids. The lack of signal sequence or putative transmembrane domain in the polypeptide suggested an intracellular localization. As shown in Fig. 1, the carboxyl-terminal region of the sequence (residues 352–508) was highly identical to the B30.2 domain of butyrophilin (41% identity) (37Jack L.J.W. Mather I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14481-14486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ishii T. Aoki N. Noda A. Achadi T. Nakamura R. Matsuda T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and marenostrin/pyrin (40% identity) (32The French Familial Mediterranean Fever Consortium.Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 33The International Familial Mediterranean Fever Consortium.Cell. 1997; 90: 797-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Because of its preferential intestinal expression (see below) and according to its homology with the B30.2 domain of butyrophilin, the product of the 3.9D1 clone was named enterophilin-1. As also indicated in Fig. 1, the amino-terminal part of enterophilin-1 (residues 11–326) contained 45 heptad repeats preceded by a leucine residue (32 repeats), an aromatic amino acid (3 repeats), or a basic residue (7 histidines, 2 lysines, and 1 arginine). This sequence did not reveal significant homology with any known protein. Besides five other clones related to enterophilin-1 but differing by their amino-terminal end, the seventh clone (7.9D1) coded for a putative protein containing 18 heptad repeats. However, despite the presence of the whole B30.2 domain, a frameshift introduced a premature stop codon limiting the protein sequence to the leucine zipper domain. As shown in Fig. 1, the corresponding protein was referred to as enterophilin-2-short (Ent-2-S). Finally, the sequence of the 9D1 clone perfectly matched the sequence of Ent-2-S but still contained the intact B.30.2 domain. This was referred to as enterophilin-2-long (Ent-2-L), but its sequence is not presented herein because it did not contain the methionine initiation codon. These sequence data indicated that enterophilins could be the prototypes of a new subgroup among the proteins bearing a B30.2 domain. Their most remarkable feature is a very long leucine zipper. As illustrated in Fig. 2 A, this allowed the prediction of an almost perfect geometrical alignment of amino acid residues at each position of the α helix: whereas positiona displays only leucine, subsequent positions by rotating around the helix were successively basic (KHKKHK … at positione, RQKRQK … at position b), acidic (EDEEDE … at position f), neutral (KTEKTE … at position c, TQQTQQ … at position g), and again predominantly acidic (DKEDEEDEE … at positiond). In contrast, Ent-1 did not display the same geometrical regularity, and some of the heptad repeats contained a basic amino acid instead of a leucine or aromatic residue, as mentioned above (Fig.2 B). Using the anti-peptide antibody described under “Experimental Procedures,” enterophilin-1 was detected as a 65-kDa protein in isolated guinea pig enterocytes (Fig. 3 C). This corresponded to its predicted molecular mass, indicating that enterophilin-1 probably did not undergo any posttranslational modification. These data were confirmed by in vitro coupled transcription translation with the pCI-Ent-1 construct (Fig.3 A), and they fitted with the detection of an identical polypeptide in pCI-Ent-1-transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, following an efficient fractionation of enterocytes, as shown by the segregation of villin from lamin B, enterophilin-1 was found to be concentrated in the nuclear fraction, although some amounts could still be detected in the cytosol (Fig. 3 C). Further attempts to localize enterophilin-1 by immunohistochemical techniques remained unsuccessful, probably because the epitopes recognized by both the anti-peptide and the anti-B30.2 domain antibodies remained buried either in the protein itself or by associated proteins. Thus, indirect evidence for a nuclear localization of enterophilin-1 was obtained using COS-7 cells transfected with pGFP-Ent-1, allowing the expression of enterophilin-1 in fusion with GFP. As shown in Fig. 3 D, 1, fluorescence microscopy analysis showed that cells transfected with pGFP-Ent-1 displayed a diffuse cytosolic staining, whereas a strong nuclear signal could be observed. In contrast, GFP alone was distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 3 D, 3). Identical results were obtained using pcDNA3-Ent-1 for cell transfection, with the carboxyl-terminal c-myc end being detected with an anti-c-myc antibody (data not shown). A number of guinea pig tissues were analyzed by Northern blotting to detect the presence of enterophilin-1 mRNA (Fig. 4). A large 2-kb transcript was highly expressed in intestine and slightly detected in heart. Moreover, a weak band corresponding to a larger mRNA was observed in the lung. The smeared signal detected in the intestine suggested a possible RNA degradation. However, rRNA staining (Fig. 4,bottom panel) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe hybridization signal (Fig. 4, middle panel), which were used to compare RNA loading, suggested that this was not the case. The smeared signal probably results from the diversity of enterophilin mRNA, as already suggested by data from cDNA cloning. In support of this, Northern blotting per"
