https://openalex.org/W1969697265,"An understanding of the basic defect in the inherited disorder cystic fibrosis requires cloning of the cystic fibrosis gene and definition of its protein product. In the absence of direct functional information, chromosomal map position is a guide for locating the gene. Chromosome walking and jumping and complementary DNA hybridization were used to isolate DNA sequences, encompassing more than 500,000 base pairs, from the cystic fibrosis region on the long arm of human chromosome 7. Several transcribed sequences and conserved segments were identified in this cloned region. One of these corresponds to the cystic fibrosis gene and spans approximately 250,000 base pairs of genomic DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2001772277,"The erythroid-specific transcription factor Eryf1 binds to DNA sites within regulatory regions of every member of both the alpha- and beta-globin families in chicken. The distribution of these sites suggests that Eryf1 may serve as a general ""switch"" factor for erythroid development. We have cloned the cDNA for Eryf1 and show that the corresponding mRNA is present in all erythroid lineages, but is absent from non-erythroid cells. We demonstrate that the cDNA encodes the specific Eryf1 binding activity found in erythrocytes. Eryf1 is a basic 38 kd protein containing a pair of highly similar ""fingers"" with the motif Cys-x-x-Cys-x17-Cys-x-x-Cys. The amino acid sequences of these regions bear no resemblance to those found in other regulatory proteins with a similar arrangement of cysteine residues. Our evidence suggests, furthermore, that transition metal ions are unusually tightly bound, or may not be necessary for the sequence-specific DNA binding of Eryf1."
https://openalex.org/W1569253487,"Laminin is a basement membrane glycoprotein which consists of A, Bl, and B2 chains. Laminin has diverse biological activities including promoting cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, growth, and neurite extension. Synthetic peptides from the active region of the A chain were prepared and tested for their biological activity. A 19-mer peptide (designated PA22â€“2), from just above the carboxyl globule on the long arm of the A chain, was found to promote cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and neurite outgrowth. By testing smaller sequences within the 19-mer peptide, a constituent pentapeptide, IKVAV (Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val), was identified as the active site for cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth. These data suggest that this sequence is one of the principle sites in laminin which regulate cellular behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2020432281,"The signal transduction pathways that lead to chloroplast biogenesis in plants are largely unknown. We describe here the identification and initial characterization of a novel genetic locus which fits the criteria of a regulatory gene located in a central pathway controlling light-mediated development. In the absence of light, these Arabidopsis thaliana mutants, designated det1 (de-etiolated 1), constitutively display many characteristics that are light-dependent in wild-type plants, including leaf and chloroplast development, anthocyanin accumulation, and accumulation of mRNAs for several light-regulated nuclear and chloroplast genes. The switch between dark and light growth modes thus appears to be a programmed step in a developmental pathway that is defined by det1. We suggest a model where the primary role of light on gene expression is mediated by the activation of leaf development. Further, the recessive nature of the det1 mutation implies that there is negative growth control on leaf development in dicotyledonous plants in the absence of light."

Criminal justice approaches to the drug problem have proven limited in their capacity to curtail drug abuse. They also have proven increasingly costly and counterproductive. Drug legalization policies that are wisely implemented can minimize the risks of legalization, dramatically reduce the costs of current policies, and directly address the problems of drug abuse."
https://openalex.org/W1524537326,"With the aim of identifying proteins involved in linking microtubules to other cytoplasmic structures, microtubule-binding proteins were isolated from rat liver extracts by a taxol-dependent procedure. The major non-tubulin component, a 58-kDa protein (designated 58K), was purified to homogeneity by gel filtration chromatography. To aid further characterization of 58K, purified preparations of the protein were used as immunogen for the production of monoclonal antibodies. Five different monoclonals were obtained, and each of these reacted on immunoblots of liver homogenates with a single band that comigrated with 58K. Based on the results of immunochemical, peptide mapping, and microsequencing experiments, 58K was found to be unrelated structurally to similarly sized cytoskeleton-associated proteins, such as tubulin, tau, vimentin, or keratin, and to represent a new protein species. Several in vitro properties of 58K were found to be characteristic of microtubule-associated proteins. For instance, 58K cosedimented quantitatively with microtubules out of liver extracts, stimulated polymerization of tubulin, and bound to microtubules in a saturable manner. In contrast to traditional microtubule-associated proteins, however, 58K was not found to be distributed uniformly along microtubules in cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy of cultured hepatoma cells revealed, instead, that 58K is associated principally with the Golgi apparatus. Moreover, Golgi membranes isolated from rat liver were observed by immunoblotting to contain significant levels of 58K, which, upon subfractionation of the membranes, partitioned as if it were a peripheral membrane protein exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the Golgi. These collective results have been evaluated in terms of earlier evidence that the intracellular position and structural integrity of the Golgi relies on the presence and organization of microtubules. In that context, the observations reported here suggest that the in vivo function of 58K is to provide an anchorage site for microtubules on the outer surface of the Golgi."
https://openalex.org/W1534452194,"Tissue and plasma forms of angiotensin (Ang) peptides were characterized by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and three specific radioimmunoassays. This method allowed resolution of 10 Ang peptides and revealed distinctive distributions for the three principal Ang peptides in the brain, adrenal gland, and plasma. In extracts from the rat hypothalamus, approximately equimolar amounts of Ang-(1-7), Ang-II, and Ang-I were detected (1.10, 1.18, and 1.45 pmol/g of tissue, respectively). A similar profile was observed in the medulla oblongata and amygdala, although the content of these three peptides was 40-70% less than that seen in the hypothalamus. In the adrenal gland, the predominant peptide was Ang-II (1.07 pmol/g); levels of Ang-(1-7) (0.19 pmol/g) and Ang-I (0.14 pmol/g) were approximately 20% that of Ang-II. In plasma, the major angiotensin was Ang-I (0.13 pmol/ml), with lower levels of Ang-(1-7) and Ang-II (0.01-0.02 pmol/ml). This study is the first demonstration of the endogenous presence of Ang-(1-7) in central and peripheral tissues of the rat. Moreover, the data suggest tissue-specific processing of angiotensins, with Ang-(1-7) being a predominant Ang peptide in the central nervous system. In light of the recent biological properties described for this peptide, Ang-(1-7) may represent an active member of Ang peptides in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1554404149,"Abstract Monoclonal antibodies identify two distinct isoforms of troponin I in rat cardiac muscle, one predominant in the embryonic and fetal heart and one predominant in the adult heart. The two isoforms can be resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with apparent molecular weights of 27,000 and 31,500, respectively. The adult isoform is specifically recognized by a monoclonal antibody that is unreactive with the embryonic variant, while two other monoclonal antibodies recognize both isoforms. A monoclonal antibody to cardiac troponin T was used to isolate by affinity chromatography the troponin complex from adult and neonatal rat heart. Affinity purified troponin from neonatal heart was found to contain both the embryonic and adult isoforms of troponin I. Comparative immunoblotting analysis with different muscle tissues shows that embryonic troponin I is identical with respect to electrophoretic mobility and pattern of immunoreactivity to the major troponin I isoform found in adult slow skeletal muscle. Troponin I switching may be implicated in developmental changes involving Ca2+ and pH sensitivity of the contractile system and response to beta-adrenergic stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2107098006,"The structure and function of transcription factors of higher plants was studied by isolating cDNA clones encoding a wheat sequence-specific DNA binding protein. A hexameric nucleotide motif, ACGTCA, is located upstream from the TATA box of several plant histone genes. It has been suggested that this motif is essential for efficient transcription of the wheat histone H3 gene. A wheat nuclear protein, HBP-1 (histone DNA binding protein-1), which specifically binds to the hexameric motif, has previously been identified as a putative transcription factor. A cDNA clone encoding HBP-1 has been isolated on the basis of specific binding of HBP-1 to the hexameric motif. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that HBP-1 contains the leucine zipper motif, which represents a characteristic property of several eukaryotic transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1585033005,"Abstract cDNAs encoding the entire coding regions of the precursors (p) of rat long chain acyl-CoA (LCAD), short chain acyl-CoA (SCAD) and isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD) have been cloned and sequenced. Three cDNAs for rat liver LCAD together cover a 1440-base pair region. These cDNAs encode the entire 430-amino acid sequence of pLCAD, including the 30-amino acid leader peptide and the 400-amino acid mature LCAD. A single 1773 base pair cDNA for rat SCAD covers the entire coding region (414 amino acids), including the 26-amino acid leader peptide and the 388-amino acid mature peptide. Four identified IVD cDNAs, when combined, encompass a 2104 base region, and encode 424 amino acids including a 30-amino acid leader peptide and the 394-amino acid mature peptide. The identities of all cDNA clones have been confirmed by matching the amino acid sequences predicted from the respective cDNAs to the amino-terminal and tryptic peptide sequences derived from the corresponding purified rat enzyme. Comparison of the sequences of four rat acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, including LCAD, MCAD, SCAD, and IVD, and two of their human counterparts (MCAD and SCAD) reveals a high degree of homology (57 invariant and 92 near invariant residues: 30.6-35.4% of identical residues in pairwise comparisons), suggesting that these enzymes belong to a gene family and have evolved from a common ancestral gene."
https://openalex.org/W1601949152,"Antistasin is a 119-amino acid protein isolated from the salivary glands of the Mexican leech Haementeria officinalis. The determination of the primary structure of antistasin revealed that the protein is highly disulfide-bonded with a 2-fold internal homology. Antistasin exhibits a potent anticoagulant activity purportedly due to the selective inhibition of Factor Xa (Tuszinsky, G. P., Gasic, T. B., and Gasic, G. J. (1987) J. Biol. chem. 262, 9718-9723). In the present study a detailed kinetic analysis of the inhibitory interaction between antistasin and Factor Xa was performed. In addition, the specificity of antistasin was examined by testing its ability to inhibit a variety of serine proteinases. Utilizing purified antistasin and a tripetidyl p-nitroanilide substrate, antistasin was shown to act as a reversible inhibitor of Factor Xa which exhibits slow-tight binding kinetics. Antistasin reacts stoichiometrically with Factor Xa with inhibition displaying a mixed, primarily competitive type. The inhibition is partial in the presence of Ca2+ and becomes complete in the absence of Ca2+. The estimated dissociation constant for the enzyme-inhibitor complex is between 0.31 and 0.62 nM. After binding to Factor Xa, antistasin is cleaved at a single site to yield a modified inhibitor. Automated gas-phase sequence analysis of the modified inhibitor indicates the arginine residue at position 34 in antistasin occupies the P1 position of the reactive site. These data indicate that the leech has evolved a highly selective and potent inhibitor of coagulation Factor Xa that shares several mechanistic similarities with other serine proteinase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1603834935,"A lectin (Amaranthin) present in the seeds of Amaranthus caudatus has been isolated by fractionation on DEAE-cellulose followed by affinity chromatography on Synsorb-T beads (Gal beta 1,3GalNAc alpha-O-R-Synsorb). The lectin appeared homogeneous by gel electrophoresis at pH 4.3 and gave a single protein band by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Mr = 33,000-36,000. A native Mr = 54,000 was determined by gel filtration suggesting that amaranthin exists as a homodimer. Compositional analysis revealed high amounts of acidic and hydroxyamino acids and relatively large amounts of lysine, methionine, and tryptophan for a plant protein. Amaranthin formed a precipitate with asialo-bovine submaxillary mucin, asialo-ovine submaxillary, porcine submaxillary mucin, asialo-fetuin and asialoglycophorin. Hapten inhibition of precipitate formation between amaranthin and asialo-ovine submaxillary indicated that the T-disaccharide and its alpha-linked glycosides (Gal beta 1,3GalNAc alpha-O-R; R = OH, methyl, -(CH2)8-COOCH3, allyl, o-nitrophenyl, or benzyl) were the best inhibitors. N-Acetylgalactosamine, the only monosaccharide which inhibited precipitation, was 350-fold less effective than Gal beta 1,3GalNAc alpha-O-R. Hapten inhibition with derivatives of the T-disaccharide suggested that the C'-4 axial hydroxyl group of the galactosyl moiety, and the C-4 axial hydroxyl group, and the C-2 acetamido group of the GalNAc unit are the most important loci for lectin interaction. NeuAc alpha 2,3Gal beta 1,3GalNAc alpha-O-(CH2)8CO2CH3 was as potent an inhibitor as Gal beta 1,3GalNAc alpha-O-(CH2)8CO2-CH3, and amaranthin was precipitated by NeuAc alpha 2,3Gal beta 1,3GalNAc alpha-O-BSA (where BSA is bovine serum albumin), indicating that the amaranthin-combining site tolerates substitutions at the C'-3 hydroxyl group. Amaranthin was precipitated by a Gal beta 1,3GalNAc alpha-O-BSA glycoconjugate but not by the anomeric Gal beta 1,3GalNAc beta-O-BSA glycoconjugate illustrating that the disaccharide must be linked alpha in order to interact with the lectin. Metal ions do not appear to be required for lectin activity. A study of pH dependence showed significant precipitate formation between pH 4 to 9 with a maximum at pH 5. Hapten inhibition and glycoconjugate precipitation assays were also conducted for peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin. A comparison between the carbohydrate-binding specificities of amaranthin and peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1952572662,"Abstract Cofilin is a widely distributed 21-kDa actin-modulating protein that forms intranuclear actin/cofilin rods in cultured fibroblastic cells exposed to heat shock or 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. In this study, cofilin was shown to be phosphorylated on a serine residue in cultured rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that about 50% of the cofilin was phosphorylated in 3Y1 cells at 37 degrees C. Exposure of the cells to heat shock at 43 degrees C induced dephosphorylation of cofilin. The dephosphorylation of cofilin was detected about 30 min after the temperature shift and was completed within 120 min. Moreover, treatment of cells with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide also caused the dephosphorylation of cofilin. However, incubation of the cells with an isotonic NaCl solution, which induced cytoplasmic actin/cofilin rods, did not induce dephosphorylation of cofilin. Other cellular stress agents such as 6% ethanol or 50 microM sodium arsenite, which caused some heat shock responses in cells, did not induce dephosphorylation of cofilin. Thus, cofilin dephosphorylation was closely correlated with its nuclear accumulation. Incubation of the enucleated 3Y1 cells at 43 degrees C still induced dephosphorylation of cofilin, suggesting that the dephosphorylation occurred mostly in the cytoplasm in intact cells. It is likely that cofilin is dephosphorylated in the cytoplasm prior to its nuclear accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2061640623,"In developing nervous systems, many peripheral and central pathways are established by early arising populations of pioneer neurons. The growth cones of these pioneer neurons can migrate while embryonic distances are short and while intervening tissue is relatively uncomplicated. Are these pioneers necessary? In grasshopper embryos, a pair of pioneer neurons arise at the tips of limb buds and extend axons through the limb to the central nervous system. Growth cones of later arising sensory neurons migrate along the pioneer axons. After ingrowth of sensory axons, the pioneer neurons die. If the pioneer neurons are prevented from differentiating by heat shock, then the sensory growth cones that would have migrated along them are blocked and fail to reach the central nervous system. Thus, the pioneer axons are necessary for successful migration of these sensory growth cones. By crossing a segment boundary early in embryogenesis, the pioneers circumvent an incompatibility between differentiated segment boundary cells and growth cone migration. Pioneer neurons may resolve similar problems in many systems."
https://openalex.org/W1570858759,"A parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHRP) has been identified in human tumors associated with the syndrome of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The PTHRP and parathyroid hormone (PTH) genes appear to have arisen by duplication and to represent members of a gene family. PTHRP mRNAs have been demonstrated in a number of normal tissues, but little is known concerning the regulation of PTHRP gene expression in any site. We studied PTHRP gene expression in TT cells, a human C-cell line which also produces calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide. We found that both the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, and the active vitamin D metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, decreased steady-state PTHRP mRNA levels in TT cells in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. The dexamethasone effect was completely blocked by the glucocorticoid antagonist RU-486. 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was found to be inactive. Neither dexamethasone nor 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 appeared to influence PTHRP mRNA stability in TT cells, and both agents were shown by nuclear transcription run-off assay to decrease PTHRP gene transcription. These findings indicate that the PTHRP gene is under the transcriptional control of glucocorticoids and vitamin D in a cell line with prototypical neuroendocrine features."
https://openalex.org/W2065253023,"Human alpha- and beta-globin genes were separately fused downstream of two erythroid-specific deoxyribonuclease (DNase) I super-hypersensitive sites that are normally located 50 kilobases upstream of the human beta-globin gene. These two constructs were coinjected into fertilized mouse eggs, and expression was analyzed in transgenic animals that developed. Mice that had intact copies of the transgenes expressed high levels of correctly initiated human alpha- and beta-globin messenger RNA specifically in erythroid tissue. An authentic human hemoglobin was formed in adult erythrocytes that when purified had an oxygen equilibrium curve identical to the curve of native human hemoglobin A (Hb A). Thus, functional human hemoglobin can be synthesized in transgenic mice. This provides a foundation for production of mouse models of human hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease."
https://openalex.org/W1515695497,"Carp parvalbumin coordinates calcium through one carbonyl oxygen atom and the oxygen-containing side chains of 5 amino acid residues, or 4 residues and a water molecule, in a helix-loop-helix structural motif. Other calcium-binding proteins, including calmodulin and troponin C, also possess this unique calcium-binding design, which is designated EF-hand or calmodulin fold. Parvalbumin has two such sites, labeled CD and EF. Each of the calcium-binding sites of refined structures of proteins belonging to this group has a 7-oxygen coordination sphere except those of the structure of parvalbumin as it was reported in 1975. This structure had been refined at 1.9 A using difference Fourier techniques on film data. The CD site appeared to be 6-coordinate and the EF site 8-coordinate. Results of NMR experiments using 113Cd-substituted parvalbumin, however, indicate that the sites are similar to one another with coordination number greater than 6. To resolve the inconsistency between crystallographic and NMR results, 1.6 A area detector data was collected for native and cadmium-substituted parvalbumin; the structures have been refined to R factors of 18.7% and 16.4%, respectively, with acceptable geometry and low errors in atomic coordinates. Differences between the parvalbumin structure described in 1975 and the present structure are addressed, including the discovery of 7-coordination for both the CD and EF sites."
https://openalex.org/W1554994168,"Abstract Association and dissociation rate constants for O2, CO, and methyl isocyanide binding to native and distal pocket mutants of R state human hemoglobin were measured using ligand displacement and partial photolysis techniques. Individual rate constants for the alpha and beta subunits were resolved by comparisons between the kinetic behavior of the native and mutant proteins. His-E7 was replaced with Gly and Gln in both alpha and beta subunits and with Phe in beta subunits alone. In separate experiments Val-E11 was replaced with Ala, Leu, and Ile in each globin chain. The parameters describing ligand binding to R state alpha subunits are sensitive to the size and polarity of the amino acids at positions E7 and E11. The distal histidine in this subunit inhibits the bimolecular rate of binding of both O2 and CO, sterically hinders bound CO and methyl isocyanide, and stabilizes bound O2 by hydrogen bonding. The Val-E11 side chain in alpha chains also appears to be part of the kinetic barrier to O2 and CO binding since substitution with Ala causes approximately 10-fold increases in the association rate constants for the binding of these diatomic ligands. However, substitution of Val-E11 by Ile produces only small decreases in the rates of ligand binding to alpha subunits. For R state beta subunits, the bimolecular rates of O2 and CO binding are intrinsically large, approximately 2-5-fold greater than those for alpha subunits, and with the exception of Val-E11----Ile mutation, little affected by substitutions at either the E7 or E11 positions. For the beta Val-E11----Ile mutant the association rate and equilibrium constants for all three ligands decreased 10-50-fold. All of these results agree with Shaanan's conclusions that the distal pocket in liganded beta subunits is more open whereas in alpha subunits bound ligands are more sterically hindered by adjacent distal residues (Shaanan, B. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 171, 31-59). In the case of O2 binding to alpha subunits, the unfavorable steric effects are compensated by the formation of a hydrogen bond between the nitrogen atom of His-E7 and bound dioxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1611906974,"Abstract It has been proposed that the regulatory domain of protein kinase C contains a pseudosubstrate site between amino acid residues 19 and 36 (House, C., and Kemp, B. E. (1987) Science 238, 1726-1728). Antiserum raised against this peptide sequence has now been shown to completely activate protein kinase C in the absence of calcium and phospholipids. Pre-clearing the antiserum with resin-immobilized pseudosubstrate peptide eliminates the ability of the serum to activate protein kinase C. Activation is not the result of degradation of the enzyme to a calcium- and phospholipid-independent fragment; the activated protein kinase remains intact. Although there are minor sequence differences in the pseudosubstrate region, the three principal protein kinase C isoforms (alpha, beta, and gamma) are recognized and apparently activated by the same pseudosubstrate antiserum. These results provide strong evidence that the pseudosubstrate region, presumably by interacting with the substrate binding site, is responsible for maintaining the catalytic domain in an inactive state. We propose that incubation of protein kinase C with the pseudosubstrate antiserum renders the catalytic domain accessible to protein substrates in a manner analogous to the conformational changes induced by physiological activators such as phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1563709336,"Human plasma glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) has been shown to be a glycosylated selenoprotein distinct enzymatically, structurally, and antigenically from known cellular glutathione peroxidases. The extracellular location of the enzyme and the fact that it is glycosylated suggested that it is a secreted protein. Utilizing mutually non-cross-reactive antibodies to human cellular and plasma GSHPx, we conducted a search to determine the tissue of origin for plasma GSHPx. The cells screened were endothelial cells because they are the main source of extracellular superoxide dismutase, HL-60 cells (myeloid cell line) because they are the main source of extracellular H2O2, and Hep G2 cells (hepatic cell line) because they are the source of many plasma proteins. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were metabolically labeled with either [35S]methionine or [75Se]selenious acid, and HL-60 cells and Hep G2 cells were metabolically labeled with [75Se]selenious acid. Proteins were immunopurified from the labeled cells and their media with either anti-red blood cell (RBC) GSHPx IgG or with anti-plasma GSHPx IgG. Utilizing anti-RBC GSHPx IgG, only the cellular form of the enzyme was precipitated from all the cells tested but not from their media. When anti-plasma GSHPx IgG was applied to the cells and their media, a selenoprotein was precipitated only from the media of Hep G2 cells. When Hep G2 cells were incubated in the presence of the carboxylic ionophore monensin, an intracellular selenoprotein could be detected using anti-plasma GSHPx IgG. The precipitation of the cellular form from all three cell types was partially inhibited by preincubation of the anti-RBC GSHPx IgG with purified RBC GSHPx while the precipitation of the selenoprotein from the medium of Hep G2 cells by anti-plasma GSHPx IgG was prevented by preincubation of the antibody with purified plasma GSHPx. We suggest that plasma GSHPx is synthesized by and secreted from hepatic cells. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the only known selenoprotein with a defined function that has been shown to be synthesized for secretion by mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1554114554,"Cachectin/tumor necrosis factor is initially synthesized as a 26 kilodalton prohormone. This molecule is 76 (human) or 79 (mouse) amino acids longer than the mature protein, as a result of additional residues present at the amino terminus. A short hydrophobic stretch of amino acids serves to anchor the prohormone in lipid bilayers; the mature protein, as well as a partially processed form of the hormone, are secreted after cleavage of the propeptide. We have analyzed the cleavage of the murine propeptide as it occurs in RAW 264.7 cells and now report that scission occurs at a site within the propeptide fragment, 10 residues before the amino-terminal leucine of the mature protein. This incompletely processed form of the molecule also begins with a leucine residue. Although secreted as a soluble product, it is biologically inactive in the L-929 cell cytotoxicity assay."
https://openalex.org/W1515644524,"Abstract The effects of hydrostatic pressure on the extracellular hemoglobin of Glossoscolex paulistus were investigated by studies of light scattering, intrinsic protein fluorescence, filtration chromatography, and oxygen binding. Pressure promoted a large decrease of light scattering consistent with the dissociation of the hemoglobin. Pressures up to 1.7 kbar caused dissociation with reversibility of the light scattering and fluorescence properties after return to atmospheric pressure. Higher pressures provoked additional dissociation with increasing loss of reversibility. After complete dissociation by incubation at 2.5 kbar followed by decompression, the protein continued mostly dissociated. The dissociated forms were distributed in two populations as based on size exclusion chromatography, one corresponding to small dissociated units (average Mr = 33,000) and the other population corresponding to the one-twelfth subunit (260,000 Mr). The pressure dissociation curves showed no significant dependence on protein concentration suggesting that the native hemoglobin population exists in a distribution of free-energies of association. Both the decrease of concentration dependence and the loss of ability to reassemble seem to increase with the complexity and size of the protein aggregate. These findings permit the conclusion that increased heterogeneity of free-energies of association with the size of the aggregate may result in the molecular individuality of large protein complexes such as subcellular particles and viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1520839822,"A highly purified Golgi preparation from rat liver was fractionated on a sucrose density gradient and the activity of two sialyltransferases, CMP-NeuAc: GalÎ²1â†’4Glc-Cer (lactosylceramide) Î±-2â†’3sialyltransferase; Sat-1), and CMP-NeuAc: GalÎ²1â†’3GalNAcÎ²1â†’4(NeuAcÎ±2â†’3)GalÎ²1â†’4Glc-Cer (GM1 ganglioside) Î±2 â†’3sialyltransferase; SAT-4), involved in the biosynthesis of gangliosides were assayed in the collected fractions. These two activities were recovered in different regions of the gradient; SAT-1 was found in a more dense region than SAT-4. This distribution coincided with that of two N-Asn linked oligosaccharide processing enzymes (UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme precursor GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase and UDP-Gal:ovalbumin galactosyltransferase), assumed as putative markers of eis- and trans-Golgi cisternae, respectively. These findings are consistent with the assembly of ganglioside oligosaccharide chains occurring in different sub-Golgi compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1551182844,"Abstract The insulin receptor is an essential protein present on the surface of virtually all cells. Little is known about the control of the level of this protein on cellular surfaces, but it has been found that the level of insulin receptor protein correlates roughly with the level of insulin receptor (IR) gene transcripts within cells. Although the protein-encoding region is only about 4000 base pairs (bps), there are multiple species of IR mRNA ranging in size from 5400 to 9400 bps. We have found that the variation in size of these transcripts is due to multiple 3' ends, presumably reflecting alternative polyadenylation, so that the final IR exon ranges in size from 1400 to 5400 bps. The IR gene promoter is like other housekeeping promoters in that it has no TATA or CAAT boxes, is extremely GC-rich, and has multiple transcriptional initiation sites primarily within a 300-bp GC-rich region. Reporter gene analysis using IR promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (HIRcat) fusion plasmids established regions responsible for promoter activity and verified the localization of the major IR gene transcriptional initiation sites. However, transfection with HIRcat plasmids containing regions from -153 to -1818 resulted in increased utilization of the most 5' IR gene mRNA initiation sites in transfected relative to untransfected cells. Reporter gene analysis also established that a region of the IR promoter and first exon containing all of the transcriptional initiation sites is more active in HepG2 than CV1 cells. Because the steady-state level of expression of the IR gene is much higher in HepG2 than CV1 cells, the results of the reporter gene analysis may reflect tissue-specific differences in IR gene transcription. Such tissue-specific transcriptional regulation would be a novel finding in a housekeeping promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1568636839,"Abstract The chloroplast rps12 gene encoding ribosomal protein S12 from wild-type as well as from streptomycin-resistant and -dependent mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was cloned and sequenced. At least six mRNA transcripts ranging in size from 800 to 4800 nucleotides were found to contain the rps12 coding sequence. As in Escherichia coli and Euglena, the C. reinhardtii rps12 gene is continuous, in contrast to its trans-spliced structure in higher plants. However, rps12 of C. reinhardtii is no longer immediately adjacent to the rps7 gene encoding ribosomal protein S7 as it is in other organisms. The deduced amino acid sequence of C. reinhardtii S12 protein shows strong homologies (48-79% identity) to S12 protein sequences of other organisms, but it has extra amino acid residues at its C terminus. Single base pair changes at different sites result in streptomycin-resistant or -dependent mutants with amino acid changes identical to comparable mutations in the E. coli S12 protein. The chloroplast rps12 gene is also expressed under the control of its own promoter in E. coli cells, and the C. reinhardtii S12 protein produced assembles into the E. coli ribosomes where it appears to function efficiently."

Control cDNA probes spanning the area of the pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 2(I) chains likely to contain the mutations were radioactively labeled and used to form heteroduplexes with total patient RNA. Treatment of these heteroduplexes with hydroxylamine followed by cleavage of the cDNA strand at reactive bases by piperidine identified mismatches in the pro-alpha 1(I) cDNA in four patients. In the fifth patient a mismatch was detected in the pro-alpha 2(I) cDNA. To characterize these mutations the regions containing the mismatches were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced. All were heterozygous single base mutations which led to the substitution of glycine residues in the helical region of the pro-alpha-chains. The substitutions were pro-alpha 1(I) Gly973 and Gly1006 to Val, Gly928 to Ala, Gly976 to Arg, and pro-alpha 2(I) Gly865 to Ser. These mutations emphasize the importance of the Gly-X-Y repeating amino acid sequence for normal collagen helix formation and function in the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1510716108,"To better understand the mechanisms that determine cell type-specific gene expression, we have examined the transcriptional activity of a 13-nucleotide long sequence element, designated C3P, located in the promoter of the apoCIII gene. We demonstrate that this element is required for high levels of apoCIII gene expression in hepatic cells and is sufficient to determine hepatic specific expression when introduced into a heterologous promoter. A protein was identified in hepatic cell nuclear extracts, designated AF-1, that binds to this sequence and is presumably responsible for its transcriptional activity in hepatic cells. Even though the C3P element is not active in HeLa cells, a protein with C3P binding specificity was identified in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. While the HeLa protein is similar to the hepatic AF-1 in its binding specificity and relative abundance, it has approximately twice the molecular weight of the hepatic protein, indicating that they are different proteins or different forms of the same protein. A variety of murine tissue types, including those that do not express the apoCIII gene, were found to contain C3P binding proteins. We conclude that the cell type-specific activity of the C3P element is not due to the absence of C3P binding proteins in nonexpressing cells but is the result of qualitative differences in C3P binding proteins in different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1520955426,"Abstract Neutrophils pretreated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1-10 nM) and stimulated with low concentrations of chemotactic agonists (1-10nM) exhibited a marked increase in respiratory burst activity that was characterized by regular oscillations. These were accompanied by parallel oscillations in turbidity having the same phase and period. Four different agonists, f-Met-Leu-Phe, complement fragment C5a, platelet-activating factor, and leukotriene B4, induced virtually identical oscillations, with mean periods of 7.9 +/- 0.6 s (respiratory burst) and 7.9 +/- 0.8 s (turbidity) at 37 degrees C. No burst oscillations were observed at high agonist concentrations (50-100 nM) unless the fungal metabolite 17-hydroxywortmannin was added prior to stimulation. In the absence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, the respiratory burst activity was inhibited by 17-hydroxywortmannin, the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine, and calcium depletion, while agonist-dependent turbidity changes including the oscillations were unaffected. Turbidity changes reflect corresponding changes in cell size and/or shape, suggesting that cyclic alterations in morphology such as lamellipod extension and retraction physically affect the catalytic efficiency of the membrane-bound burst enzyme NADPH-oxidase. The oscillations appear to be controlled via receptor-dependent activation mechanisms which do not involve PKC activation or the rise in internal calcium presumably derived from phospholipase C activation."
https://openalex.org/W1632443824,"Transcobalamin I (TCI) is a member of the R binder family of vitamin B12 binding proteins. It is a major protein constituent of secondary granules in neutrophils. We have isolated and characterized full length cDNA clones encoding TCI in order to determine whether its expression is coordinately regulated with the appearance of secondary granules and whether it is consequently a useful marker of granulocyte development. Partial amino acid sequences of human R protein were obtained from tryptic digestion fragments. Using the polymerase chain reaction, a partial TCI cDNA probe was isolated by selective amplification of a region of cDNA located between two oligonucleotides deduced from the available partial amino acid sequences. The amplified probe was then used to obtain full length clones from a granulocyte cDNA library. Identity of the clones was confirmed by matching DNA sequence to known peptide amino acid sequence. TCI is transcribed to a single 1.5-kilobase mRNA species. The predicted protein sequence is 433 amino acids long. We have compared the sequence of TCI to that of rat intrinsic factor. The two proteins have areas of extensive homology which implicate regions potentially important for vitamin B12 binding. TCI mRNA was present in late neutrophil precursors but absent from uninduced and induced HL60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1561113340,"Abstract Resonance Raman enhancement of derivatives and intermediates of horseradish peroxidase in the near ultraviolet (N-band excitation) results in intensity and enhancement patterns that are different from those normally observed within the porphyrin Soret (B-band) and alpha-beta (Q-band) absorptions. In particular it allows the resolution of resonance Raman spectra of horseradish peroxidase compound I. The bands above 1300 cm-1 can be assigned to porphyrin vibrational modes that are characteristically shifted in frequency due to removal of an electron from the porphyrin ring. The resonance Raman frequency shifts follow normal mode compositions. Relative to resonance Raman spectra of compound II, the v4 frequency (primarily Ca-N) exhibits a 20 cm-1 downshift. The v2, v11, and v37 vibrational frequencies whose mode compositions are primarily porphyrin Cb-Cb, exhibit 10-20 cm-1 upshifts. The v3, v10, and v28 frequencies, whose mode compositions are primarily Ca-Cm, exhibit downshifts. The downshifts for v3 and v10 are small, 3-5 cm-1; however, the downshift for v28 is 14 cm-1. These frequency shifts are consistent with those of previously published resonance Raman studies of model compounds. In contrast to reports from other laboratories, the data presented here for horseradish peroxidase compound I can be attributed unambiguously to resonance Raman scattering from a porphyrin pi-cation radical."
https://openalex.org/W1525334726,"Abstract Translocation of soluble 12-lipoxygenase to membranes was examined in rat platelets. Preincubation of platelet homogenates with 0.1-10 microM Ca2+ resulted in an increase in 12-lipoxygenase activity of the particulate fraction with a concomitant decrease in that of the soluble fraction. Kinetic parameters of 12-lipoxygenase of the soluble and membrane fractions were not changes in the presence of 10 microM Ca2+. Ca2+-induced association of 12-lipoxygenase to the particulate fraction was dependent on the amounts of platelet-soluble and membrane fractions but not on the incubation temperature. 12-Lipoxygenase activity associated with the particulate fraction was completely dissociated by reducing the concentration of Ca2+ to 10 nM. Ca2+-induced association of the enzyme also occurred in the boiled- and trypsin-treated membranes but was significantly reduced in the phospholipase A2-treated membranes. Soluble 12-lipoxygenase also associated to liposomes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Pretreatment of platelets with thrombin (0.5-5 units/ml) significantly caused a translocation of soluble 12-lipoxygenase to particulate fraction; in the time course study, the translocation was observed at the thrombin pretreatment of 1, 5, and 10 min. These results suggest that stimulation of platelets is followed by the translocation of soluble 12-lipoxygenase to membranes, which is mediated by physiological concentration of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1482779223,"Optimal conditions for solubilization and stabilization of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger from rod outer segments were examined. The exchanger was found to be most stable at low detergent concentrations (7.5 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate), greater than or equal to 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.0-7.5, and with 0.1% added soybean asolectin. The sulfhydryl-modifying reagent, dithiothreitol, caused a loss of exchanger activity and was omitted throughout the purification procedure. These conditions were used to purify the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger from rod outer segments by a combination of selective solubilization, ion exchange, and wheat germ agglutinin chromatography. The procedure achieves a 336-fold increase in exchanger specific activity. The presence of exchanger activity most closely correlates with a polypeptide of molecular mass 215-kDa. Exchanger activity in both the crude rod outer segments and the purified exchanger is specifically dependent upon the presence of K+ in the assay medium; neither choline nor Li+ can substitute for K+."
https://openalex.org/W1513665928,"Abstract A mutant low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor with abnormal ligand binding and recycling abilities was found in a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia. The molecular weights of the precursor and the mature form of the receptor were 72,000 and 115,000, respectively, which were about 45,000 smaller than those of the normal receptor. The mutant receptor was concluded to be present on the cell surface because the mature form was susceptible to Pronase digestion, and specific monoclonal antibody against the LDL receptor (IgG-C7) could bind to the cell surface. This mutant receptor could not bind LDL, but could bind other ligands for the LDL receptor, beta-migrating very low density lipoprotein, and the apolipoprotein E-lipid complex. After the receptor bound to the ligand, it disappeared from the cell surface of the mutant cells faster than that of normal cells, showing that, in the mutant cells, the receptor was not efficiently recycled back to the cell surface. Southern blotting of the genomic DNA from the patient showed a large deletion of about 12 kilobases around the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain. For further characterization of the mutant, we cloned a 9.4-kilobase EcoRI/XbaI fragment, which was expected to contain the deletion joint. Mapping and sequencing analyses of the receptor gene showed that exons 7-14 were deleted. The nucleotide sequence suggested that this mutation may have occurred by recombination between repetitive Alu sequences in introns 6 and 14 of the receptor gene. The recombination brought about a complete deletion of the gene coding the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain. The characteristics of the receptor protein produced by this mutation were similar to those of an artificial mutation constructed by Davis et al. (Davis, C. G., Goldstein, J. L., Sudhof, T. C., Anderson, R. G. W., Russell, D. W., and Brown, M. S. (1987) Nature 326, 760-765) in which the whole gene coding this domain was deleted. The clinical phenotype of the patient having this mutation was similar to that of so-called receptor-defective type familial hypercholesterolemia, in which cells show detectable, but markedly reduced activity of the LDL receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1516190791,"Abstract The macrolide antibiotic rifampicin is a potent inducer of cytochrome P-450-mediated drug metabolism in humans and rabbits. In this report, we demonstrate that in immature rabbits, rifampicin activates the transcription of the Cyp3A6 gene which encodes P450IIIA6 (cytochrome P-450 3c). The maximum increase in transcription was seen at 12 h following administration of rifampicin. Northern and slot blot analyses indicate that mRNAs corresponding to P450IIIA6 accumulates during the period of increased transcription and persist at 18 h when the rate of transcription has returned to basal levels. P450IIIA6 protein accumulates in liver microsomes over this period. At 24 h a greater than 10-fold increase in microsomal P450IIIA6 protein is detected by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody to P450IIIA6. The rate of microsomal progesterone 6 beta-hydroxylase activity is also elevated when compared to untreated rabbits, and this enzyme is activated in vitro by alpha-naphthoflavone. To determine whether this enzyme is stimulated by alpha-naphthoflavone in intact cells, COS-1 cells were transfected with an expression vector harboring the coding region of a P450IIIA6 cDNA. Our results demonstrate that the transfected COS-1 cells exhibit progesterone 6 beta-hydroxylase activity that is stimulated by alpha-naphthoflavone added to the culture medium."
https://openalex.org/W1538079996,"New glycoproteins of 100-120 kDa were isolated from the unfertilized eggs of flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus. Compositionally indistinguishable glycopeptides of 6 kDa were also purified from the activated or fertilized eggs. These high and low molecular mass glycoproteins are characterized by high (about 85%) carbohydrate content. Although some heterogeneities exist in the amino acid sequences, the 6-kDa glycopeptides (decapeptides with single large N-linked glycan chains), isolated from the fertilized eggs are the repeating units of the high molecular mass glycoproteins. As judged from several distinctive features the 100-120-kDa glycoproteins are apparently major components of cortical alveoli of flounder eggs and are regarded as members of glycoproteins we have defined under the name of hyosophorin (Kitajima, K., Inoue, S., and Inoue, Y. (1989) Dev. Biol. 132, 544-553). Composition analysis, Smith degradation, hydrazinolysis-nitrous acid deamination, permethylation analysis, and 400-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy provided evidence for the structure of a novel penta-antennary glycan chain attached to the repeating unit (decapeptide) of the protein core. The structure thus determined is: (Formula: see text). The presence of a unique class of carbohydrate-rich glycoproteins (H-hyosophorin) in the unfertilized eggs, their conversion to the repeating unit (L-hyosophorin) at fertilization, and the finding of a free glycan chain that was formed by scission between the GlcNAc and Asn residues of L-hyosophorin, in the fertilized eggs including embryos of 4-11-h postinsemination, support the view that these molecules may be important in fertilization and subsequent development."
https://openalex.org/W1545314684,"Rat liver deflavoxanthine dehydrogenase has been prepared by incubating native enzyme with calcium chloride. On reconstitution with FAD, about 85% of the original activity is recovered, all which is the O2-dependent type. In contrast, when dithiothreitol-treated deflavoenzyme is incubated with FAD, the recovery of activity is almost the same as above, but most of the recovered activity is of the NAD-dependent type. Deflavoenzyme with or without previous treatment with dithiothreitol was also reconstituted with two artificial FAD analogues, 8-mercapto-FAD and 6-OH-FAD. The difference spectra between the reconstituted enzymes and the initial deflavoenzyme indicate that, in each case, the FAD analogue is bound in its neutral form in dithiothreitol-treated enzyme, whereas it is bound in the anionic form in enzyme without previous dithiothreitol treatment. Furthermore, the protonated forms can be converted into the anionic forms on storage with a concomitant change of activity from the NAD-dependent to the O2-dependent type. This clearly indicates different environments around FAD in the two types of enzyme protein, which are shown to be interconvertible through oxidation-reduction of enzyme cysteinyl residues."
https://openalex.org/W1591958125,"Abstract We report on membrane protein changes in an L1210 leukemia cell line with a highly specific defect in the function of the methotrexate (MTX)-tetrahydrofolate cofactor transport carrier. This clonal line, MTXrA, made 100-fold resistant to MTX, was derived in a single step and exhibited stable resistance over 120 generations in the absence of drug. The transport defect was associated with a 10-fold decrease in influx Vmax without a change in influx Km. There was no difference between the MTXrA and parent lines in the levels or affinities of specific cell surface binders for MTX nor in the labeling of the 44-kDa membrane protein upon treatment with the specific affinity label, N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of tritiated MTX. Consistent with impaired carrier function was the observation that trans-stimulation of MTX influx by intracellular 5-formyltetrahydrofolate observed in the parent line was not demonstrated in the MTXrA line. The transport defect was highly specific for the MTX-tetrahydrofolate cofactor transport carrier. Initial uptake rates for 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine and 2-deoxyglucose were unchanged and influx and net transport of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid were, in fact, increased. There was no cross-resistance of this line to phenylalanine mustard or cytosine arabinoside, agents that utilize specific amino acid and nucleoside transport carriers, respectively. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified plasma membrane preparations stained with Coomassie Blue revealed several protein differences between the parental and MTXrA lines. Most prominent is a band at approximately 190 kDa which ran with slightly greater mobility than a lesser staining band in the parent line. [3H]Borohydride labeling of cells also identified a distinct protein peak in the MTXrA line at approximately 190 kDa eliminated by prior treatment of cells with neuraminidase. Absence of expression of protein or mRNA related to the multidrug resistance gene as well as lack of cross-resistance to daunorubicin or trimetrexate indicate that this mechanism of resistance to MTX is completely unrelated to the multidrug resistance phenomenon observed with high molecular weight heterocyclic compounds. These data represent the first demonstration of membrane protein differences in a highly resistant L1210 murine leukemia cell line with a marked unique defect in MTX transport which appears to be related to impaired mobility of the tetrahydrofolate-cofactor carrier. Further studies are now required to elucidate the possible role of one or more of these proteins in the transport defect."
https://openalex.org/W1571363345,"19F NMR and x-ray absorption experiments have been performed with both the isolated FeMo cofactor and the MoFe protein of nitrogenase in search of direct evidence for substrate or inhibitor binding. Using 19F NMR as a probe and p-CF3C6H4S- as the receptor ligand, the data show that the nitrogenase inhibitors CN- and CH3NC bind to the isolated FeMo cofactor-RFS- complex in N-methylformamide with a finite formation constant. Their binding increases the electronic relaxation time of the complex and increases the life-time of the FeMo cofactor-p-CF3C6H4S- bond, Parallel molybdenum K edge and extended x-ray absorption fine structure experiments show that CH3NC does not bind to molybdenum. Although CO and N3- both relieve CN- and CH3NC inhibition of electron flow through nitrogenase, unlike the latter, they do not appear to bind to isolated FeMo cofactor. In experiments with the dithionite-reduced MoFe protein, we did not detect any changes in the molybdenum K edge or extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectra upon addition of CO, N2, C2H2, NaCN, CH3NC, or azide demonstrating that either these substrates and inhibitors do not bind to molybdenum or that the FeMo cofactor site of nitrogenase is inaccessible to substrate binding except under turnover conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1578671115,"Abstract The bicyclic colchicine analogue 2-methoxy-5-(2',3',4'-trimethoxyphenyl)-2,4,6-cycloheptatrien-1-on e (MTC) has been used to study the thermodynamics of specific ligand binding to the colchicine site of tubulin, employing isothermal reaction microcalorimetry. The binding of MTC to purified calf brain tubulin, in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, is characterized by delta H degree = -19 +/- 1 kJ.mol-1, delta G degree = -31.8 +/- 0.6 kJ.mol-1, and delta S degree = 43 +/- 5 J.mol-1.K-1 at 298 K, with a slight variation in the temperature range from 283 to 308 K. The binding thermodynamics of colchicine and allocolchicine are similar to MTC under the conditions examined, suggesting related molecular interactions of the three ligands with the protein binding site. The standard enthalpy changes of binding of colchicine and MTC at 308 K coincide within experimental error. Therefore the more favorable free energy change of binding of colchicine must come from a larger binding entropy change (by about 20 J.mol-1.K-1). This difference could be attributed to the presence of the middle ring of colchicine, which is absent in MTC. Consistently, a similar entropy change is observed by the comparison of allocolchicine to MTC binding at several temperatures. In addition, allocolchicine binding is about 6 kJ.mol-1 less exothermic than MTC binding, which could be attributed to the presence in allocolchicine of a substituted phenyl ring instead of the colchicine-MTC tropolone ring. The present results and analysis are fully compatible with the previously proposed bifunctional binding of colchicine and MTC (through their trimethoxybenzene and tropolone moieties) to a bifocal protein binding site, and also with a partial immobilization of intramolecular rotation of MTC upon binding, which in colchicine is already constrained by its middle ring (Andreu, J. M., Gorbunoff, M. J., Lee, J. C., and Timasheff, S. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 1742-1752)."
https://openalex.org/W1496051522,"A novel sulfated glycosphingolipid that belongs to the globo-series was isolated from human kidney. This lipid was purified from a pooled kidney preparation by chloroform/methanol extraction, mild alkaline treatment, DEAE-Sephadex and silicic acid column chromatographies, and preparative thin layer chromatography. The structure and the properties were studied by infrared spectroscopy, two-dimensional proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, negative secondary ion mass spectrometry, solvolysis, compositional and methylation analyses, monoclonal antibodies, and sulfatide-binding proteins. From the results of the above analyses, the structure of this glycolipid was proposed to be HSO3-3Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-3Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1ceramide. The proton resonance at 3.93 ppm of the H-3 of the sulfated nonreducing terminal galactose of this lipid was downfield-shifted (delta 0.48 ppm), as compared with H-3 of the internal beta-galactose because of the electronegativity of the sulfate ester. This sulfated lipid reacted with a monoclonal anti-SSEA-3 (MC-631) (Kannagi, R., Cochran, N. A., Ishigami, F., Hakomori, S., Andrews, P. W., Knowles, B. B., and Solter, D.

This lipid also bound to the 125I-labeled sulfatide-binding protein, thrombospondin.

https://openalex.org/W1574165915,"We have demonstrated previously that cultured rat ovarian granulosa cells synthesize and secrete apoE, and this production of apoE is increased by agents that stimulate protein kinase A (cyclic AMP-dependent enzyme) (for example, cholera toxin) and protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) (for example, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, a phorbol ester). In the studies presented in this report, we have examined the effect of changes in cell cholesterol synthesis on the production of apoE by rat ovarian granulosa cells. Mevinolin, an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis), and 4,4,10 Î²-trimethyl-trans-decal-3 Î²-ol, an inhibitor of squalene cyclization, both attenuate the cholera toxin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation of granulosa cell apoE secretion and apoE mRNA content in a dose-responsive manner. The inhibitory effect of mevinolin is reversed by the concomitant administration of mevalolactone, which provides the cells with the product of the reaction catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase. Steroidogenesis per se has no effect on apoE production. Aminoglutethimide, which blocks the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis, has no effect on apoE or apoE mRNA. The data indicate that products of HMG-CoA reductase (isoprenes, cholesterol and/or cholesterol metabolites) are required along with stimulators of protein kinases A and C, to regulate ovarian granulosa cell apoE production."

https://openalex.org/W1522888755,"Abstract The proenzyme form of beta-glucuronidase is compartmentalized in large quantities within the endoplasmic reticulum by binding to the esterase, egasyn. Also, the propeptide of the proenzyme form of beta-glucuronidase is likely located at the carboxyl terminus. We have, therefore, tested if this carboxyl-terminal peptide is important in binding to egasyn. A polyclonal antibody to a 30-mer synthetic peptide, corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids of pro-beta-glucuronidase, provided evidence that egasyn binds to the carboxyl terminus of beta-glucuronidase. This antibody interacted with proenzyme beta-glucuronidase-egasyn complexes in which one, two, or three egasyn molecules were bound to the beta-glucuronidase tetramer, but not with those complexes (M4) which contained four egasyn molecules. We interpret these results as indicating that all available carboxyl termini of the beta-glucuronidase proenzyme tetramer are shielded by egasyn in the M4 complexes. The same antibody did not recognize the mature lysosomal form of beta-glucuronidase, indicating that only the proenzyme form of microsomal beta-glucuronidase contains the original carboxyl terminus. Also, the synthetic 30-mer was found to be a specific and potent inhibitor (50% inhibition at 1.3 microM) of the esterase activity of purified egasyn but exhibited little inhibitory activity toward other purified esterases including a rat trifluoroacetylated esterase or egasyn esterase from another species. Together, these data describe a potent interaction of the exposed carboxyl terminus of precursor glucuronidase with the esterase catalytic site of egasyn, which in turn results in the specific localization of glucuronidase within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1514610082,"Abstract Rapid reaction kinetics of the flavoprotein anthranilate hydroxylase from Trichosporon cutaneum were examined for reactions involving anthranilate, the native substrate. As was reported earlier for the nonhydroxylated substrate analogue, salicylate, some reactions in the first turnover with anthranilate occur slower than those in subsequent turnovers (Powlowski, J., Massey, V., and Ballou, D. P. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5606-5612). Evidence is presented for slow conformational changes that occur both on binding of the aromatic ligand and on reduction of the enzyme. These changes are apparently important for rapid anthranilate binding to occur in turnovers subsequent to the first. Moreover, bound anthranilate is required for rapid reduction of enzyme-bound FAD by NADPH. Studies to probe the accessibility of reagents to modified flavins that had been incorporated into the apoenzyme indicate that anthranilate binding causes a conformational change in the protein, allowing increased access to the benzene ring moiety of the flavin. An unusual isotope effect with (R)-NADPD (4(R)-2H] NADPH) is observed on Kd rather than on kred, which is consistent with a model involving slow interconversion of enzyme-substrate complexes before productive binding of NADPH and reduction of the enzyme flavin."
https://openalex.org/W2144187637,"Developmentally controlled genomic deletion-ligations occur during ciliate macronuclear differentiation. We have identified a novel activity in Tetrahymena cell-free extracts that efficiently catalyzes a specific set of intramolecular DNA deletion-ligation reactions. When synthetic DNA oligonucleotide substrates were used, all the deletion-ligation products resembled those formed in vivo in that they resulted from deletions between pairs of short direct repeats. The reaction is ATP-dependent, salt-sensitive, and strongly influenced by the oligonucleotide substrate sequence. The deletion-ligation activity has an apparent size of 200-500 kd, no nuclease-sensitive component, and is highly enriched in cells developing new macronuclei. The temperature inactivation profile of the activity parallels the temperature lethality profile specific for Tetrahymena cells developing new macronuclei. We suggest that this deletion-ligation activity carries out the genomic deletions in developing macronuclei in vivo."

V8 protease digestion of p31 purified from PDGF-, TPA-, and arsenite-treated cells showed identical fragmentation patterns, demonstrating that these agents modulate synthesis of the same (or a highly similar) protein. TPA-induced p31 synthesis was cell cycle-specific, occurring in density-arrested but not exponentially replicating cells. p31 was readily labeled with [35S]methionine but not with [35S]cysteine. Thus it is not a metallothionein. The protein associated with nuclei. It appears to be highly hydrophobic because solubilization required detergents or organic solvents. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) provided further evidence of hydrophobicity. p31 has been purified to homogeneity using sodium dodecyl sulfate gels with electroelution and reverse-phase HPLC. It has an isoelectric point of 6.8. Its nuclear localization and amino acid analysis demonstrate that p31 is not heme oxygenase, a 32-kDa arsenite-induced microsomal protein.

Fragments arising from limited proteolysis were separated by affinity chromatography using P-pyridoxal-Sepharose as supporting matrix. Catalytically active fractions, eluted by pyridoxine-5-P (5mM), displayed three bands when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular masses of the three protein bands are considerably lower than 28 kDa, the molecular mass of monomeric pyridoxine-5-P oxidase. Spectroscopic studies, absorption, fluorescence, and circular dichroism revealed that the microenvironment surrounding the cofactor flavin mononucleotide is not perturbed by limited proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1579196454,"The Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHO-tsH1 is a temperature-sensitive leucyl-tRNA synthetase mutant that shows temperature-dependent regulation of the amino acid transport responsible for accumulating leucine, System L. At nonpermissive temperatures, CHO-tsH1 cells are unable to grow because they are unable to incorporate leucine into protein. As a result, System L activity is increased. We have isolated mutants from CHO-tsH1 that have constitutively de-repressed System L activity. These mutants are temperature-resistant as a result of increased intracellular steady-state accumulations of System L-related amino acids, which compensates for the defective synthetase activity. In this study, we have subjected one of these regulatory mutant cell lines (C11B6) to a tritium-suicide selection, in which L-[3H]leucine was used as a toxic substrate. Three mutant cell lines, C4B4, C5D9, and C9D9 that showed reduced System L transport activity were isolated. The decreases in the initial rates of System L transport activity lead to reduced steady-state accumulations of System L-related amino acids. In contrast to the parental cell line, C11B6, the transport-defective mutants are temperature-sensitive because the reduced intracellular pool of leucine can no longer compensate for the defective synthetase activity."
