https://openalex.org/W2067236515,"An outstanding challenge in the field of molecular biology has been to understand the process by which proteins fold into their characteristic three-dimensional structures. Here, we report the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 μs and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins. In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state."

Rather than assessing kinase-compound binding, Anastassiadis et al. use functional assays to profile the activities of 178 commercially available kinase inhibitors against 300 recombinant human protein kinases. Small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors are widely used to elucidate cellular signaling pathways and are promising therapeutic agents. Owing to evolutionary conservation of the ATP-binding site, most kinase inhibitors that target this site promiscuously inhibit multiple kinases. Interpretation of experiments that use these compounds is confounded by a lack of data on the comprehensive kinase selectivity of most inhibitors. Here we used functional assays to profile the activity of 178 commercially available kinase inhibitors against a panel of 300 recombinant protein kinases. Quantitative analysis revealed complex and often unexpected interactions between protein kinases and kinase inhibitors, with a wide spectrum of promiscuity. Many off-target interactions occur with seemingly unrelated kinases, revealing how large-scale profiling can identify multitargeted inhibitors of specific, diverse kinases. The results have implications for drug development and provide a resource for selecting compounds to elucidate kinase function and for interpreting the results of experiments involving kinase inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2032679533,"Mobilization of retrotransposons, genetic elements able to move around in the genome where they can become incorporated and start to amplify themselves, is normally suppressed in somatic cells. However, recent reports indicate that L1 retrotransposons can be mobilized in the human brain; this has important consequences for intercellular variation. Using a high-throughput approach, Baillie et al. identify numerous germ-line mutations and putative somatic insertions in the human hippocampus and caudate nucleus, including those of Alu elements. The implication is that retrotransposition-driven somatic mosaicism may reshape the genetic circuitry that underpins normal and abnormal neurobiological processes. Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that use a germline ‘copy-and-paste’ mechanism to spread throughout metazoan genomes1. At least 50 per cent of the human genome is derived from retrotransposons, with three active families (L1, Alu and SVA) associated with insertional mutagenesis and disease2,3. Epigenetic and post-transcriptional suppression block retrotransposition in somatic cells4,5, excluding early embryo development and some malignancies6,7. Recent reports of L1 expression8,9 and copy number variation10,11 in the human brain suggest that L1 mobilization may also occur during later development. However, the corresponding integration sites have not been mapped. Here we apply a high-throughput method to identify numerous L1, Alu and SVA germline mutations, as well as 7,743 putative somatic L1 insertions, in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus of three individuals. Surprisingly, we also found 13,692 somatic Alu insertions and 1,350 SVA insertions. Our results demonstrate that retrotransposons mobilize to protein-coding genes differentially expressed and active in the brain. Thus, somatic genome mosaicism driven by retrotransposition may reshape the genetic circuitry that underpins normal and abnormal neurobiological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2073094091,"Determining the composition of protein complexes is an essential step toward understanding the cell as an integrated system. Using coaffinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry analysis, we examined protein associations involving nearly 5,000 individual, FLAG-HA epitope-tagged Drosophila proteins. Stringent analysis of these data, based on a statistical framework designed to define individual protein-protein interactions, led to the generation of a Drosophila protein interaction map (DPiM) encompassing 556 protein complexes. The high quality of the DPiM and its usefulness as a paradigm for metazoan proteomes are apparent from the recovery of many known complexes, significant enrichment for shared functional attributes, and validation in human cells. The DPiM defines potential novel members for several important protein complexes and assigns functional links to 586 protein-coding genes lacking previous experimental annotation. The DPiM represents, to our knowledge, the largest metazoan protein complex map and provides a valuable resource for analysis of protein complex evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2012671659,"A full description of the human proteome relies on the challenging task of detecting mature and changing forms of protein molecules in the body. Large-scale proteome analysis has routinely involved digesting intact proteins followed by inferred protein identification using mass spectrometry. This 'bottom-up' process affords a high number of identifications (not always unique to a single gene). However, complications arise from incomplete or ambiguous characterization of alternative splice forms, diverse modifications (for example, acetylation and methylation) and endogenous protein cleavages, especially when combinations of these create complex patterns of intact protein isoforms and species. 'Top-down' interrogation of whole proteins can overcome these problems for individual proteins, but has not been achieved on a proteome scale owing to the lack of intact protein fractionation methods that are well integrated with tandem mass spectrometry. Here we show, using a new four-dimensional separation system, identification of 1,043 gene products from human cells that are dispersed into more than 3,000 protein species created by post-translational modification (PTM), RNA splicing and proteolysis. The overall system produced greater than 20-fold increases in both separation power and proteome coverage, enabling the identification of proteins up to 105 kDa and those with up to 11 transmembrane helices. Many previously undetected isoforms of endogenous human proteins were mapped, including changes in multiply modified species in response to accelerated cellular ageing (senescence) induced by DNA damage. Integrated with the latest version of the Swiss-Prot database, the data provide precise correlations to individual genes and proof-of-concept for large-scale interrogation of whole protein molecules. The technology promises to improve the link between proteomics data and complex phenotypes in basic biology and disease research."
https://openalex.org/W2144578935,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling, mediated through the transcription factors Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3), directs different responses in different cell types. Here we report that Smad3 co-occupies the genome with cell-type-specific master transcription factors. Thus, Smad3 occupies the genome with Oct4 in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), Myod1 in myotubes, and PU.1 in pro-B cells. We find that these master transcription factors are required for Smad3 occupancy and that TGF-β signaling largely affects the genes bound by the master transcription factors. Furthermore, we show that induction of Myod1 in nonmuscle cells is sufficient to redirect Smad3 to Myod1 sites. We conclude that cell-type-specific master transcription factors determine the genes bound by Smad2/3 and are thus responsible for orchestrating the cell-type-specific effects of TGF-β signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2043161346,"The extent of lung regeneration following catastrophic damage and the potential role of adult stem cells in such a process remains obscure. Sublethal infection of mice with an H1N1 influenza virus related to that of the 1918 pandemic triggers massive airway damage followed by apparent regeneration. We show here that p63-expressing stem cells in the bronchiolar epithelium undergo rapid proliferation after infection and radiate to interbronchiolar regions of alveolar ablation. Once there, these cells assemble into discrete, Krt5+ pods and initiate expression of markers typical of alveoli. Gene expression profiles of these pods suggest that they are intermediates in the reconstitution of the alveolar-capillary network eradicated by viral infection. The dynamics of this p63-expressing stem cell in lung regeneration mirrors our parallel finding that defined pedigrees of human distal airway stem cells assemble alveoli-like structures in vitro and suggests new therapeutic avenues to acute and chronic airway disease.

Infections by this H1N1 influenza A strain is thought to induce acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) marked by a rapid onset of pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage and associated hypoxemia, and a massive elevation in inflammatory cytokines (Berthiaume et al., 1999Berthiaume Y.

While the terminal pathology of H1N1 influenza and other causes of ARDS is becoming clear, we know less about what role regenerative processes play in recovery from ARDS. Clearly ARDS patients show improved lung function six to twelve months out, but for some both pulmonary and extrapulmonary deficits remain in the longer term (Herridge et al., 2003Herridge M.S. Cheung A.M. Tansey C.M. Matte-Martyn A. Diaz-Granados N. Al-Saidi F. Cooper A.B. Guest C.B. Mazer C.D.

Med. 2003; 348: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). How much of the observed improvement in these patients is actually regeneration versus adaptive remodeling remains an area of intense study. Presumably regenerative processes in the airways involve local stem cell populations. Bronchioalveolar stem cells, or BASCs, which express both Clara cell markers (CC10) as well as alveolar type II (AT2) cell markers (SPC), have been described at terminal bronchioles and are proposed to be stem cells for both the bronchiolar as well as the alveolar epithelia (Giangreco et al., 2002Giangreco A.

However, lineage tracing of Scgb1a1+ (CC10) Clara cells demonstrate their role as progenitors in the repair of terminal bronchiolar epithelium but not of the alveolar epithelium (Rawlins et al., 2009Rawlins E.L.

In addition, BASCs lack precise cellular and molecular profiles and may consist of multiple stem cell types with different lineage commitment. For the upper airways, basal cells expressing the stratified epithelial stem cell transcription factor p63 (Yang et al., 1998Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillette E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C.

Whether stem cells for alveolar epithelia also exist in mice and participate in lung regeneration following damage is unknown. Models of lung damage in mice have yet to provide clear evidence for the existence of alveolar regeneration mechanisms. The most common lung injury model involves exposure to bleomycin, which results in widespread bronchiolar and alveolar damage. However, the invariable consequence of bleomycin treatment is parenchymal fibrosis rather than de novo alveolar assembly (Moore and Hogaboam, 2008Moore B.B. Hogaboam C.M.

The successful adaptation of highly pathogenic human influenza A viruses to mice offers potential insights into both infectious disease and more nuanced models for recovery from ARDS (Mori et al., 1995Mori I.

Use of animal models to understand the pandemic potential of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.Adv. Virus Res. 2009; 73: 55-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For instance, sublethal doses of a murine-adapted H1N1 (PR8) influenza A induces widespread damage to both upper and lower airways marked by epithelial destruction and immune cell infiltrates between four and 14 days post infection (dpi). Remarkably, these mice show viral clearing by eight dpi and a histologically complete recovery of lung tissue over the next several months (Narasaraju et al., 2010Narasaraju T. Ng H.H. Phoon M.C. Chow V.T. MCP-1 antibody treatment enhances damage and impedes repair of the alveolar epithelium in influenza pneumonitis.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2010; 42: 732-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Understanding the extent and molecular sequence of alveolar regeneration and the role of progenitors and stem cells in this process will direct future efforts toward therapeutically enhancing lung regeneration. In this work, we examine the induction and recovery from an ARDS-like syndrome in mice infected with sublethal doses of a murine-adapted H1N1 influenza virus. We show that despite extensive damage to airway epithelial tissues, a p63-expressing population of cells in bronchioles undergoes a massive expansion and dispersion to sites of affected lung parenchyma. These migratory p63-expressing cells form discrete foci or “pods” that expand to a size and shape approximating those of alveoli and express genes linked to alveolar function. In parallel studies we clone three regiospecific stem cells from human airways and demonstrate that one of these, the distal airway stem cell (DASC), has the unique potential of differentiating to alveolar lineages. We discuss the possibility that these p63-expressing cells participate in alveolar assembly processes modeled by human DASCs in vitro, and therefore represent key features in lung regeneration in response to ARDS. Mice were infected with a murine-adapted H1N1 (PR8) influenza A by intratracheal aspiration at viral titers of 125 to 1x105 PFU to determine an LD50 of approximately 500PFU. We chose 250PFU as a dose to induce significant damage without lethality in our experiments (Figure 1A and Figures S1A and S1B available online). Lungs were harvested at multiple dpi and analyzed by histology and viral protein expression (Figure 1B). Viral load was estimated by monitoring the expression of the M2 viral ion channel protein by immunofluorescence, which revealed maximal staining at 4 dpi and a loss of M2 signal by 11 dpi (Figure 1B). However, tissue damage, as measured by the degree of immune cell infiltration, appeared to peak at 11 dpi, was reduced at 21 dpi, and was largely cleared across the lung by 60 dpi (Figure 1B). These results are mirrored by weight loss in these animals that reaches an extreme at 10–12 dpi and recovers by day 20 (Figure S1C). At the cellular level, we observed widespread destruction of all airway epithelial cells at 7 dpi resulting in a significant loss of markers for Clara cells (CC10) and ciliated cells (acetylated α-tubulin, TAp73) in the bronchiolar epithelia and AT2 cells (SPC+) of the alveolar epithelium (Figure S1D). Damage to airway epithelium is consistent with our observations of viral M2 expression in these cells at four days post-infection (Figure S1E). The peak of dense infiltrates of immune cells (CD45+) corresponds to the dense histological appearance of the lung at 11–14 dpi (Figure S1F).Figure S1Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Survival curve of mice infected with a range of viral titers (105 −103 pfu) and the mock infection.(B) Survival curve of mice infected with a range of viral titers (500 −125 pfu).(C) Body weight over time of mice infected with 125, 250 and 500 pfu of virus.

The H1N1 influenza-infected mice show widespread cytopathic effects and extreme weight loss, and yet both these effects are mitigated between 21-60 dpi. Remarkably, these mice recover without the acquisition of lung fibrosis that accompanies the induction of lung damage by bleomycin (Figure S1G), suggesting the possibility that epithelial regeneration underlies recovery from influenza. Given the identification of p63-expressing basal cells as stem cells for nasal and tracheal epithelia of the upper airways (Rock et al., 2009Rock J.R. Onaitis M.W. Rawlins E.L. Lu Y. Clark C.P. Xue Y. Randell S.H. Hogan B.L. Basal cells as stem cells of the mouse trachea and human airway epithelium.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 12771-12775Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), we asked whether p63-expressing cells might also participate in lung regeneration following influenza infection. We found little evidence of p63-expressing basal cells in the bronchioles of normal mice. However, by 7 dpi, cells expressing p63 were evident in bronchioles (Figures S2A and S2B ). By 11 dpi, both p63 cells and Clara cells were found intermingled in the bronchiolar epithelium, and by 21 days most of the bronchiolar epithelium appeared restored at the level of Clara cells while those with p63-expression in the bronchioles were less evident. This rise and fall of p63 expressing cells is reflected in overall p63 protein expression in distal airways (Figure S2C). Unexpectedly, p63-expressing cells were also found in large numbers in the highly damaged lung parenchyma at 11 dpi (Figure 1C and Figure S2B). On closer inspection, these p63-expressing cells in the damage lung appeared to be clustered in small groups (Figure 1D). Using other markers of basal cells, such as antibodies to keratin 5 (Krt5), it was evident that the p63-expressing cells formed discrete clusters or pods (hereafter “Krt5 pods”) in interstitial lung (Figure 1D). On a gross level, Krt5 pods were distributed in a concentric pattern about bronchioles (Figure 1E). BrdU labeling of proliferating cells at 11 dpi revealed robust cell division of the Krt5+ cells in the bronchioles as well as in the Krt5 pods (Figure 1F). Direct quantification of BrdU+/Krt5+ cells revealed a progressive decrease in intrabronchiolar regions from 11 dpi and an increase in interbronchiolar regions from 11 dpi (Figure S2D). The appearance of Krt5+ pods in the peribronchiolar regions of lung parenchyma coincides with the pinnacle of influenza-induced lung damage. Significantly, Krt5+ pods were not observed in the bleomycin-dependent lung fibrosis model (Figure S2E). To identify distal airway stem cells and assess their relationship to stem cells of the upper airways, we employed single cell cloning methods on populations of human epithelial cells derived from nasal turbinate, tracheobronchial epithelia, and distal airway tissue including bronchioles and alveoli (Rheinwald and Green, 1975Rheinwald J.G.

McKeon F. p63 is essential for the proliferative potential of stem cells of stratified epithelia.Cell. 2007; 129: 523-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). We obtained immature colonies from approximately 1:500 to 1:2000 cells, and all of these stained uniformly for p63 and for keratin 5 (Krt5) (Figure 2A ). These immature clones were provisionally designated nasal epithelial stem cells (NESCs), tracheal airway stem cells (TASCs), and distal airway stem cells (DASCs). About 80 percent of these clones could be propagated further for at least an additional estimated 50 doublings while maintaining an immature phenotype (data not shown). Despite the fact that the original starting cell populations were obtained from disparate regions of the airways, the immature stem cell clones appeared indistinguishable by morphology and staining with basal cell markers. Significantly, gene expression datasets from these clones are binned in regiospecific group by unsupervised clustering and by PCA of the whole genome expression patterns despite sharing gene expression of approximately 99% of the 17,500 hybridizing genes (Figures 2B and 2C). The long-term self-renewal potential of the putative human stem cell clones allowed us to isolate independent pedigrees for the analysis of the progeny of a single cell (Figure 2D). Expansion of these lines yielded abundant immature cells of known pedigree for a range of differentiation assays to assess lineage potential. For instance, we analyzed pedigree lines of NESCs and posted these through multiple differentiation assays. The air-liquid interface model (ALI; Schmidt et al., 1996Schmidt D. Hubsch U. Wurzer H. Heppt W. Aufderheide M. Development of an in vitro human nasal epithelial (HNE) cell model.Toxicol. Lett. 1996; 88: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) has been a powerful tool in airway epithelial differentiation and supports the differentiation of goblet cell and ciliated cells from immature populations of nasal epithelial cells. Significantly, all of our pedigree-defined lines of NESCs showed similar distributions of goblet cells and ciliated cells in ALI cultures (Figure 2E), supporting the concept that the pedigree lines we have developed from single cells in fact have lineage potential ascribed to NESCs. Whole genome expression analysis of immature, pedigree-defined lines and ALI-differentiated cells support this notion and showed an increased expression of genes involved in ciliogenesis (e.g., DYNLRB2, 22.7×;TUBA4b, 9.8×; and DNAH6, 7.2×; all p < 0.05) and in goblet cell function (e.g., MUC1, 3.8×; MUC13, 5.6×; and MUC20, 4.51×; all p < 0.05) (Figure 2E). We also performed self-assembling sphere (SAS) cultures of NESCs. SAS cultures, like the ALI cultures, induce both goblet cell and ciliated cell differentiation from NESCs, and involve the self-assembly of epithelial cells in conditions where cells cannot adhere to a solid support. NESC pedigrees readily assemble into spheres under such conditions within 24 hr, and efficiently undergo both goblet cell and ciliated cell differentiation over the following 15 days upon transfer to differentiation media (Figure 2F). Unlike the ALI cultures, which stratify into basal cells and suprabasal differentiated cells, the SAS cultures show a monolayer of ciliated cells and goblet cells polarized to the exterior and lack basal cells altogether (data not shown). Again, whole genome expression analysis supports the concept that SAS cultures promote ciliogenesis (e.g., increased expression of DYNLRB2, 68.4×; DNAH7, 28.6×; TEKT1, 25.1×; all p < 0.05) and goblet cell formation (increased expression of MUC15, 6.7×; MUC20, 7.6×; SCGB2A1, 6.1×; all p < 0.05) from our NESCs (Figure 2F). In contrast to their similar differentiation programs in ALI and SAS cultures, NESCs behaved very differently in 3-D Matrigel cultures. NESCs showed robust formation of solid spheres in Matrigel between days 5 and 10, which subsequently hollow with the addition of differentiation media, and by day 21 show immature cells at the periphery and cells with squamous differentiation toward the lumen (Figure 2G). This squamous metaplasia is supported by the comparison between gene expression of undifferentiated NESCs and those differentiated for 21 days in Matrigel, which show strong expression of squamous epithelial genes (e.g., LCE2B, 173.1×; KRT10, 6.0×; and SPRR2A, 4.5×; all p < 0.05) (Figure 2G). Similar development of a squamous metaplasia has been seen with the differentiation of nasal turbinate epithelial cell populations, suggesting that our pedigree-defined cells retain the capacity for this pathway of differentiation. Overall gene expression PCA indicates that each of these differentiation assays yields different outcomes marked by a stratified airway epithelium in ALI cultures, a nonstratified airway epithelium in SAS cultures, and a squamous metaplasia in 3-D Matrigel cultures (Figure 2H). Defined pedigrees of TASCs and DASCs were grown in ALI cultures to compare their differentiation potential with that of NESC lines. Like the NESC lines, the TASC pedigrees showed robust differentiation into ciliated cells and mucin-producing goblet cells during the 21 day period of ALI culture (Figure 3A ). In contrast, the DASC pedigrees showed only minor indications of mucin expression, rare ciliated cell formation, and occasional CC10 expression indicative of Clara cells (Figure S3A ). The TASC lines further differed from the DASC lines in their degree of stratification in ALI cultures. The TASCs presented a multilayered epithelium with p63-positive basal cells (data not shown) underneath differentiated goblet and ciliated cells, while the DASC pedigrees retain a monolayer appearance over the differentiation period (Figure 3A). Gene expression analysis of the ALI cultures of TASC and DASC lineages confirmed these observations, with the differentiated TASC cultures showing high expression of genes involved in ciliogenesis, mucin production, and epithelial stratification compared to DASCs grown in ALI culture (Figure 3A).Figure S3Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Left panel: immunofluorescence comparison of anti-CC10 staining (green) in DASC and TASC- ALI cultures.

Curiously, the DASC pedigree lines also assemble into spheres but ultimately these hollow and collapse into multispherical structures by day 21 (Figure 3B). The hollowing effect appears to be the direct consequence of apoptosis as these cells within the spheres show robust activated caspase-3 staining (Figures S3B and S3C). The multispherical entities formed from DASC lines do not stratify but appear to be comprised of unilaminar cellular assemblies that express the alveolar type 1 marker PDPN (Figure 3B). These same structures are labeled with the 4C10 monoclonal antibody that recognizes a ca. 300 kDa protein specific to human alveoli (Figure 3C). Consistent with the divergent differentiation of the TASC and DASC pedigrees in Matrigel cultures, datasets of whole genome microarrays of the structures assembled in 3-D cultures by these lines showed large differences (Figure 3D) including a host of genes implicated in alveolar structure or formation (Figure 3E and Table S1). These findings were supported by wider Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), which showed the squamous metaplasia of the TASC Matrigel structures expressed genes associated with epidermal development (Figure 3F).

https://openalex.org/W2006464386,"To identify pathways involved in adult lung regeneration, we employ a unilateral pneumonectomy (PNX) model that promotes regenerative alveolarization in the remaining intact lung. We show that PNX stimulates pulmonary capillary endothelial cells (PCECs) to produce angiocrine growth factors that induce proliferation of epithelial progenitor cells supporting alveologenesis. Endothelial cells trigger expansion of cocultured epithelial cells, forming three-dimensional angiospheres reminiscent of alveolar-capillary sacs. After PNX, endothelial-specific inducible genetic ablation of Vegfr2 and Fgfr1 in mice inhibits production of MMP14, impairing alveolarization. MMP14 promotes expansion of epithelial progenitor cells by unmasking cryptic EGF-like ectodomains that activate the EGF receptor (EGFR). Consistent with this, neutralization of MMP14 impairs EGFR-mediated alveolar regeneration, whereas administration of EGF or intravascular transplantation of MMP14(+) PCECs into pneumonectomized Vegfr2/Fgfr1-deficient mice restores alveologenesis and lung inspiratory volume and compliance function. VEGFR2 and FGFR1 activation in PCECs therefore increases MMP14-dependent bioavailability of EGFR ligands to initiate and sustain alveologenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2091802222,"Caspase 8 is known to suppress necroptosis, but its relevant target protein was unknown. Ting and colleagues show that caspase 8 cleaves the deubiquitylase CYLD to inhibit necroptosis and promote cell survival. Caspase 8 initiates apoptosis downstream of TNF death receptors by undergoing autocleavage and processing the executioner caspase 3 (ref. 1). However, the dominant function of caspase 8 is to transmit a pro-survival signal that suppresses programmed necrosis (or necroptosis) mediated by RIPK1 and RIPK3 (refs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) during embryogenesis and haematopoiesis7,8,9. Suppression of necrotic cell death by caspase 8 requires its catalytic activity but not the autocleavage essential for apoptosis10; however, the key substrate processed by caspase 8 to block necrosis has been elusive. A key substrate must meet three criteria: it must be essential for programmed necrosis; it must be cleaved by caspase 8 in situations where caspase 8 is blocking necrosis; and mutation of the caspase 8 processing site on the substrate should convert a pro-survival response to necrotic death without the need for caspase 8 inhibition. We now identify CYLD as a substrate for caspase 8 that satisfies these criteria. Following TNF stimulation, caspase 8 cleaves CYLD to generate a survival signal. In contrast, loss of caspase 8 prevented CYLD degradation, resulting in necrotic death. A CYLD substitution mutation at Asp 215 that cannot be cleaved by caspase 8 switches cell survival to necrotic cell death in response to TNF."
https://openalex.org/W2028133785,"Throughout life, adult organs continually adapt to variable environmental factors. Adaptive mechanisms must fundamentally differ from homeostatic maintenance, but little is known about how physiological factors elicit tissue remodeling. Here, we show that specialized stem cell responses underlie the adaptive resizing of a mature organ. In the adult Drosophila midgut, intestinal stem cells interpret a nutrient cue to ""break homeostasis"" and drive growth when food is abundant. Activated in part by niche production of insulin, stem cells direct a growth program through two altered modes of behavior: accelerated division rates and predominance of symmetric division fates. Together, these altered modes produce a net increase in total intestinal cells, which is reversed upon withdrawal of food. Thus, tissue renewal programs are not committed to maintain cellular equilibrium; stem cells can remodel organs in response to physiological triggers."
https://openalex.org/W2001842463,"When proteins associate with larger structures such as polymers, membranes or solid supports, they usually become 'invisible' to the techniques used to visualize them as free molecules in solution. Marius Clore and colleagues have now developed a new technique of solution nuclear magnetic resonance that can probe such exchange phenomena at atomic resolution. Termed dark-state exchange saturation transfer (DEST), the procedure is demonstrated here by following the aggregation of the amyloid-β monomers implicated in Alzheimer's disease. It should also be adaptable to many of the supramolecular systems encountered in biological systems and materials science. Exchange dynamics between molecules free in solution and bound to the surface of a large supramolecular structure, a polymer, a membrane or solid support are important in many phenomena in biology and materials science. Here we present a novel and generally applicable solution NMR technique, known as dark-state exchange saturation transfer (DEST), to probe such exchange phenomena with atomic resolution. This is illustrated by the exchange reaction between amyloid-β (Aβ) monomers and polydisperse, NMR-invisible (‘dark’) protofibrils, a process of significant interest because the accumulation of toxic, aggregated forms of Aβ, from small oligomers to very large assemblies, has been implicated in the aetiology of Alzheimer’s disease1,2,3,4,5,6. The 15N-DEST experiment imprints with single-residue-resolution dynamic information on the protofibril-bound species in the form of 15N transverse relaxation rates (15N-R2) and exchange kinetics between monomers and protofibrils onto the easily observed two-dimensional 1H–15N correlation spectrum of the monomer. The exchanging species on the protofibril surface comprise an ensemble of sparsely populated states where each residue is either tethered to (through other residues) or in direct contact with the surface. The first eight residues exist predominantly in a mobile tethered state, whereas the largely hydrophobic central region and part of the carboxy (C)-terminal hydrophobic region are in direct contact with the protofibril surface for a significant proportion of the time. The C-terminal residues of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 display lower affinity for the protofibril surface, indicating that they are likely to be surface exposed rather than buried as in structures of Aβ fibrils7,8,9,10, and might therefore comprise the critical nucleus for fibril formation11,12. The values, however, are significantly larger for the C-terminal residues of Aβ42 than Aβ40, which might explain the former’s higher propensity for rapid aggregation and fibril formation13,14."
https://openalex.org/W2130844401,"Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) activate genes involved in the synthesis and trafficking of cholesterol and other lipids and are critical for maintaining lipid homeostasis. Aberrant SREBP activity, however, can contribute to obesity, fatty liver disease, and insulin resistance, hallmarks of metabolic syndrome. Our studies identify a conserved regulatory circuit in which SREBP-1 controls genes in the one-carbon cycle, which produces the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe). Methylation is critical for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major membrane component, and we find that blocking SAMe or PC synthesis in C. elegans, mouse liver, and human cells causes elevated SREBP-1-dependent transcription and lipid droplet accumulation. Distinct from negative regulation of SREBP-2 by cholesterol, our data suggest a feedback mechanism whereby maturation of nuclear, transcriptionally active SREBP-1 is controlled by levels of PC. Thus, nutritional or genetic conditions limiting SAMe or PC production may activate SREBP-1, contributing to human metabolic disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2110485236,"BMP and Wnt signaling pathways control essential cellular responses through activation of the transcription factors SMAD (BMP) and TCF (Wnt). Here, we show that regeneration of hematopoietic lineages following acute injury depends on the activation of each of these signaling pathways to induce expression of key blood genes. Both SMAD1 and TCF7L2 co-occupy sites with master regulators adjacent to hematopoietic genes. In addition, both SMAD1 and TCF7L2 follow the binding of the predominant lineage regulator during differentiation from multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells to erythroid cells. Furthermore, induction of the myeloid lineage regulator C/EBPα in erythroid cells shifts binding of SMAD1 to sites newly occupied by C/EBPα, whereas expression of the erythroid regulator GATA1 directs SMAD1 loss on nonerythroid targets. We conclude that the regenerative response mediated by BMP and Wnt signaling pathways is coupled with the lineage master regulators to control the gene programs defining cellular identity."
https://openalex.org/W2039011321,"Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) is a distinctive marker of the brown fat phenotype that has been proposed to coordinate the transcriptional activation of genes for lipid oxidation and for thermogenic uncoupling protein 1 in brown adipose tissue. Here, we investigated the involvement of PPARα in the transcriptional control of the PPARγ coactivator (PGC)-1α gene. Treatment with PPARα agonists induced PGC-1α mRNA expression in brown fat in vivo and in primary brown adipocytes. This enhancement of PGC-1α transcription was mediated by PPARα binding to a PPAR-responsive element in the distal PGC-1α gene promoter. PGC-1α gene expression was decreased in PPARα-null brown fat, both under basal conditions and in response to thermogenic activation. Moreover, PPARα- and cAMP-mediated pathways interacted to control PGC-1α transcription. PRDM16 (PRD1-BF1-RIZ1 homologous domain-containing 16) promoted PPARα induction of PGC-1α gene transcription, especially under conditions in which protein kinase A pathways were activated. This enhancement was associated with the interaction of PRDM16 with the PGC-1α promoter at the PPARα-binding site. In addition, PPARα promoted the expression of the PRDM16 gene in brown adipocytes, and activation of PPARα in human white adipocytes led to the appearance of a brown adipocyte pattern of gene expression, including induction of PGC-1α and PRDM16. Collectively, these results suggest that PPARα acts as a key component of brown fat thermogenesis by coordinately regulating lipid catabolism and thermogenic gene expression via induction of PGC-1α and PRDM16."

The BRCA1 protein displays E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and this enzymatic function is thought to be required for tumor suppression. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice that express an enzymatically defective Brca1. We found that this mutant Brca1 prevents tumor formation to the same degree as does wild-type Brca1 in three different genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of cancer. In contrast, a mutation that ablates phosphoprotein recognition by the BRCA C terminus (BRCT) domains of BRCA1 elicits tumors in each of the three GEM models. Thus, BRCT phosphoprotein recognition, but not the E3 ligase activity, is required for BRCA1 tumor suppression."

We argue that climate change mitigation and adaptation (M&A) actions, which will also result in significant population displacements, have not received sufficient attention. Given the emergence of resettlement as an adaptation response, it is critical to learn from research on development-forced displacement and resettlement (DFDR). We discuss two broad categories of potential displacement in response to (i) climate impacts themselves and (ii) large-scale M&A projects. We discuss policy approaches for facilitating migration and, where communities lack resources to migrate, suggest guidelines for organized resettlement."

https://openalex.org/W2015894821,"Synaptic transmission involves a fast synchronous phase and a slower asynchronous phase of neurotransmitter release that are regulated by distinct Ca(2+) sensors. Though the Ca(2+) sensor for rapid exocytosis, synaptotagmin I, has been studied in depth, the sensor for asynchronous release remains unknown. In a screen for neuronal Ca(2+) sensors that respond to changes in [Ca(2+)] with markedly slower kinetics than synaptotagmin I, we observed that Doc2--another Ca(2+), SNARE, and lipid-binding protein--operates on timescales consistent with asynchronous release. Moreover, up- and downregulation of Doc2 expression levels in hippocampal neurons increased or decreased, respectively, the slow phase of synaptic transmission. Synchronous release, when triggered by single action potentials, was unaffected by manipulation of Doc2 but was enhanced during repetitive stimulation in Doc2 knockdown neurons, potentially due to greater vesicle availability. In summary, we propose that Doc2 is a Ca(2+) sensor that is kinetically tuned to regulate asynchronous neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2089556804,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial event in wound healing, tissue repair and cancer progression in adult tissues. We have recently shown that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-induced EMT involves isoform switching of fibroblast growth factor receptors by alternative splicing. We performed a microarray-based analysis at single exon level to elucidate changes in splicing variants generated during TGF-β-induced EMT, and found that TGF-β induces broad alteration of splicing patterns by downregulating epithelial splicing regulatory proteins (ESRPs). This was achieved by TGF-β-mediated upregulation of δEF1 family proteins, δEF1 and SIP1. δEF1 and SIP1 each remarkably repressed ESRP2 transcription through binding to the ESRP2 promoter in NMuMG cells. Silencing of both δEF1 and SIP1, but not either alone, abolished the TGF-β-induced ESRP repression. The expression profiles of ESRPs were inversely related to those of δEF1 and SIP in human breast cancer cell lines and primary tumor specimens. Further, overexpression of ESRPs in TGF-β-treated cells resulted in restoration of the epithelial splicing profiles as well as attenuation of certain phenotypes of EMT. Therefore, δEF1 family proteins repress the expression of ESRPs to regulate alternative splicing during TGF-β-induced EMT and the progression of breast cancers."

The generation of Aβ is coupled to neuronal activity, but the molecular basis is unknown. Here, we report that the immediate early gene Arc is required for activity-dependent generation of Aβ. Arc is a postsynaptic protein that recruits endophilin2/3 and dynamin to early/recycling endosomes that traffic AMPA receptors to reduce synaptic strength in both hebbian and non-hebbian forms of plasticity. The Arc-endosome also traffics APP and BACE1, and Arc physically associates with presenilin1 (PS1) to regulate γ-secretase trafficking and confer activity dependence. Genetic deletion of Arc reduces Aβ load in a transgenic mouse model of AD. In concert with the finding that patients with AD can express anomalously high levels of Arc, we hypothesize that Arc participates in the pathogenesis of AD."

An analysis of sensory-motor connectivity patterns in FoxP1 mutant mice, where motor neuron position has been scrambled, shows that the final pattern of sensory-motor connections is initiated by the projection of sensory axons to discrete dorsoventral domains of the spinal cord without regard for motor neuron subtype or, indeed, the presence of motor neurons. By implication, the clustering and dorsoventral settling position of motor neuron pools serve as a determinant of the pattern of sensory input specificity and thus motor coordination."
https://openalex.org/W2114625470,"Insights into cancer genetics can lead to therapeutic opportunities. By cross-referencing chromosomal changes with an unbiased genetic screen we identify the ephrin receptor A7 (EPHA7) as a tumor suppressor in follicular lymphoma (FL). EPHA7 is a target of 6q deletions and inactivated in 72% of FLs. Knockdown of EPHA7 drives lymphoma development in a murine FL model. In analogy to its physiological function in brain development, a soluble splice variant of EPHA7 (EPHA7TR) interferes with another Eph-receptor and blocks oncogenic signals in lymphoma cells. Consistent with this drug-like activity, administration of the purified EPHA7TR protein produces antitumor effects against xenografted human lymphomas. Further, by fusing EPHA7TR to the anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) we can directly target this tumor suppressor to lymphomas in vivo. Our study attests to the power of combining descriptive tumor genomics with functional screens and reveals EPHA7TR as tumor suppressor with immediate therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2002201590,"The molecular mechanisms that contribute to the initiation and progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have not been completely delineated. Our observations indicate that defects in the transforming growth factor-β and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways are common in human HNSCCs. Conditional activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway due to Pten deletion in the mouse head and neck epithelia gives rise to hyperproliferation, but only a few lesions progress to HNSCC. However, Pten-deficient mice developed full-penetrance HNSCC in combination with type I TGF-β receptor (Tgfbr1) deletion. Molecular analysis revealed enhanced cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and increased expression of CCND1 in the basal layer of the head and neck epithelia, as well as in the tumors of Tgfbr1/Pten double conditional knockout (2cKO) mice. Furthermore, neoplastic transformation involves senescence evasion, and is associated with an increased number of putative cancer stem cells. In addition, the nuclear factor-κB pathway activation, myeloid-derived suppressor cell infiltration, angiogenesis and immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment, all of which are characteristics of human HNSCCs, contribute significantly to head and neck carcinogenesis in 2cKO mice. These tumors display pathology and multiple molecular alterations resembling human HNSCCs. This suggests that the Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO mouse model is suitable for preclinical intervention, and that it has significant implications in the development of diagnostic cancer biomarkers and effective strategies for prevention and treatment of HNSCCs."

We found that neocortical inhibitory interneurons were produced as spatially organized clonal units in the developing ventral telencephalon. Furthermore, clonally related interneurons did not randomly disperse but formed spatially isolated clusters in the neocortex. Individual clonal clusters consisting of interneurons expressing the same or distinct neurochemical markers exhibited clear vertical or horizontal organization.

https://openalex.org/W1996533937,"Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a key enzyme in glycolysis that is highly expressed in cancer. Here, Zhimin Lu and colleagues show that PKM2 can translocate to the nucleus in response to epidermal growth factor, where it contributes to β-catenin-dependent gene activation. This non-metabolic function of PKM2 seems to be important for tumour cell proliferation. Endocycles are variant cell cycles comprised of DNA synthesis (S)- and gap (G)-phases but lacking mitosis1,2. Such cycles facilitate post-mitotic growth in many invertebrate and plant cells, and are so ubiquitous that they may account for up to half the world’s biomass3,4. DNA replication in endocycling Drosophila cells is triggered by cyclin E/cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CYCE/CDK2), but this kinase must be inactivated during each G-phase to allow the assembly of pre-Replication Complexes (preRCs) for the next S-phase5,6. How CYCE/CDK2 is periodically silenced to allow re-replication has not been established. Here, using genetic tests in parallel with computational modelling, we show that the endocycles of Drosophila are driven by a molecular oscillator in which the E2F1 transcription factor promotes CycE expression and S-phase initiation, S-phase then activates the CRL4CDT2 ubiquitin ligase, and this in turn mediates the destruction of E2F1 (ref. 7). We propose that it is the transient loss of E2F1 during S phases that creates the window of low Cdk activity required for preRC formation. In support of this model overexpressed E2F1 accelerated endocycling, whereas a stabilized variant of E2F1 blocked endocycling by deregulating target genes, including CycE, as well as Cdk1 and mitotic cyclins. Moreover, we find that altering cell growth by changing nutrition or target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling impacts E2F1 translation, thereby making endocycle progression growth-dependent. Many of the regulatory interactions essential to this novel cell cycle oscillator are conserved in animals and plants1,2,8, indicating that elements of this mechanism act in most growth-dependent cell cycles."

Recent studies have shown that L. monocytogenes infection activates the autophagy pathway. However, the innate immune receptors involved and the downstream signaling pathways remain unknown. Here, we show that macrophages deficient in the TLR2 and NOD/RIP2 pathway display defective autophagy induction in response to L. monocytogenes. Inefficient autophagy in Tlr2−/− and Nod2−/− macrophages led to a defect in bacteria colocalization with the autophagosomal marker GFP-LC3. Consequently, macrophages lacking TLR2 and NOD2 were found to be more susceptible to L. monocytogenes infection, as were the Rip2−/− mice. Tlr2−/− and Nod2−/− cells showed perturbed NF-κB and ERK signaling. However, autophagy against L. monocytogenes was dependent selectively on the ERK pathway. In agreement, wild-type cells treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of ERK or ERK-deficient cells displayed inefficient autophagy activation in response to L. monocytogenes. Accordingly, fewer bacteria were targeted to the autophagosomes and, consequently, higher bacterial growth was observed in cells deficient in the ERK signaling pathway. These findings thus demonstrate that TLR2 and NOD proteins, acting via the downstream ERK pathway, are crucial to autophagy activation and provide a mechanistic link between innate immune receptors and induction of autophagy against cytoplasm-invading microbes, such as L. monocytogenes. Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen that invades both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells. Recent studies have shown that L. monocytogenes infection activates the autophagy pathway. However, the innate immune receptors involved and the downstream signaling pathways remain unknown. Here, we show that macrophages deficient in the TLR2 and NOD/RIP2 pathway display defective autophagy induction in response to L. monocytogenes. Inefficient autophagy in Tlr2−/− and Nod2−/− macrophages led to a defect in bacteria colocalization with the autophagosomal marker GFP-LC3. Consequently, macrophages lacking TLR2 and NOD2 were found to be more susceptible to L. monocytogenes infection, as were the Rip2−/− mice. Tlr2−/− and Nod2−/− cells showed perturbed NF-κB and ERK signaling. However, autophagy against L. monocytogenes was dependent selectively on the ERK pathway.

Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive food-borne pathogen that causes listeriosis, a severe form of gastroenteritis with a possible nervous system infection, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and neonates (1Vázquez-Boland J.A.

L. monocytogenes mediates its own uptake into phagocytic cells and non-phagocytic cells (e.g. enterocytes, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells) via bacterial invasion factors called internalins (3Ireton K.

Listeriolysin O then blocks phagolysosomal fusion and degrades the vacuolar membrane, leading to the escape of L. monocytogenes into the cytosol (5Hamon M. Bierne H. Cossart P. Nat. Rev.

Loessner M.J. Alberti-Segui C. Higgins D.E. Swanson J.A. Cell Microbiol. 2006; 8: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Entry into the cytoplasm is also assisted by phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C and phosphatidylcholine phospholipase C two bacterial phospholipases that hydrolyze host lipids to produce diacylglycerol and inositol phosphate, and ceramide, respectively, additionally playing a major role in subverting host cellular responses (8Gründling A.

Three to five hours after infection, L. monocytogenes in the cytosol utilizes its ActA protein to polymerize host actin forming comet-like tail that propels bacterial movement and spread from cell to cell (10Monack D.M.

TLRs are transmembrane proteins for sensing extracellular pathogens whereas NLRs sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns in the cytosolic compartment. NLRs consist of more than 20 family members, including Nucleotide Oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1), NOD2, NLRP3, and NLRC4 (12Kanneganti T.D. Lamkanfi M. Núñez G.

Furthermore, host defense against L. monocytogenes is mediated by the secretion of IFN- γ, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, CCL2, MIP2, CXCL1, and the coexpression of costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86 on antigen-presenting cells (17O'Riordan M.

Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular catabolic process that removes damaged organelles and degrades long-lived proteins during periods of starvation, thereby playing a crucial role during cell survival and death (19Yang Z.

Autophagy also has an essential role in the innate defense mechanism, i.e. it eliminates cytoplasm-invading microbes by forming a double-layered membrane that wraps around the cytosolic bacteria so that it can be degraded via fusion with lysosomes (22Deretic V.

In the context of L. monocytogenes, earlier reports have shown that TLR2 and NOD proteins play a protective role during L. monocytogenes infection. TLR2 is required for macrophage activation (31Flo T.H. Halaas O. Lien E. Ryan L. Teti G. Golenbock D.T. Sundan A. Espevik T. J.

Similarly, the NOD1-NOD2/RIP2 pathway has been shown to be critical for host defense against L. monocytogenes in vitro and in vivo (34Kim Y.G. Park J.H. Shaw M.H. Franchi L. Inohara N. Núñez G.

Here we show that the innate immune receptors TLR2 and NOD/RIP2 pathways activate autophagy via ERK activation, leading to degradation of L. monocytogenes within autophagosomes. All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. The following antibodies were used: anti-LC3 from Novus Biologicals, anti-ERK, anti-phospho-pERK, anti-IκB, anti-pIκB (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-actin, and anti-tubulin (Sigma). HRP-labeled anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. All fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Rapamycin was obtained from LC Laboratories. NF-κB inhibitor SN50 (catalog no. 481480) and MEK inhibitor PD98059 (catalog no. 513000) were obtained from Calbiochem. Nod1−/−, Nod2−/−, Rip2−/−, Tlr2−/−, Tlr4−/− mice backcrossed to the C57BL/6 background for at least 10 generations have been described before (57Lamkanfi M. Malireddi R.K. Kanneganti T.D. J. Biol.

Bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared from the femurs of 6- to 10-week-old male mice by using supernatant from L cells as differentiation medium. Wild-type L. monocytogenes and isogenic mutants were grown in brain heart infusion medium at 37 °C overnight to mid-log phase for macrophage infections. Briefly, L. monocytogenes were washed twice with PBS and macrophages were infected for 30 min with a multiplicity of infection of 1:1 unless stated otherwise, and the medium was replaced with fresh medium. After 45 min of infection, gentamicin (10 μg/ml) was added to limit the growth of extracellular bacteria. Where mentioned, CQ (50 μm) was added 30 min after infection. Where mentioned, NF-κB inhibitor SN50 (15 μM) or MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μM) were preincubated with macrophages 1 h before infection and maintained during the course of the experiment. For in vivo experiments, adult mice (6–10 weeks old) were used. For infection, wild-type and Rip2−/− mice were infected intraperitoneally with 3 × 105 L. monocytogenes. Bacterial loads in the liver and spleen were determined on day 3 after infection by serial dilution of the lysates on brain heart infusion medium. At different times after infection, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) and PhosSTOP (Roche). Lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes by electroblotting. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk and incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C and for 1 h with secondary HRP-tagged antibody at room temperature. The membranes were developed with ECL (Pierce). Cells were resuspended in nucleofector buffer (Amaxa) at a density of 2 × 106 with 2 μg of GFP-LC3 plasmid. Cells were nucleoporated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amaxa) and seeded onto glass coverslips. After 4 h, cells were infected with L. monocytogenes at a multiplicity of infection of 1:1. The cells were fixed at the desired time points with 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunoflourescence as described previously (59Anand P.K. Anand E. Bleck C.K. Anes E. Griffiths G. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5e10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells on coverslips were mounted on slides with ProLong® anti-gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and analyzed with a Nikon C1 confocal microscope with a ×40 objective lens using the manufacturer's original software. The images were processed later with the ImageJ program. For transmission electron microscopy, cells were fixed in a solution of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Cells were then embedded and sectioned for transmission electron microscopy by the Cell and Tissue Imaging Core Facility of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Cells were grown on coverslips and infected with L. monocytogenes at a multiplicity of infection of 1:1 as described above. Intracellular growth curves of L. monocytogenes were generated as described previously (60Portnoy D.A. Jacks P.S. Hinrichs D.J. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1459-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Quantifications of the number of autophagosomes per cell and LC3 - positive L. monocytogenes were performed by direct visualization on a Nikon C1 confocal microscope. For intracellular growth curves, at least three independent experiments were done in triplicate, and the means ± S.E. are reported. p values were calculated using the two-tailed Student's t test. Densitometry analysis of the immunoblots was performed by the ImageJ program. Bacterial counts of infected mice were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test. L. monocytogenes is an intracellular pathogen that escapes the phagosome and replicates in the host cytosol. Recent studies have suggested that cytoplasm-invading bacteria are targets for degradation by autophagy (36Rich K.A. Burkett C. Webster P. Cell Microbiol. 2003; 5: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). L. monocytogenes was observed to induce autophagy and colocalized with autophagosomes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and RAW 264.7 macrophages (27Py B.F. Lipinski M.M. Yuan J.

Autophagy. 2008; 4: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). LC3 is present in mammalian cells as a cytoplasmic form (LC3-I) or in a membrane-associated form (LC3-II). LC3-I is lipidated by phosphatidylethanolamine (LC3-PE) to the LC3-II form that associates to the autophagosome membrane and migrates on SDS-PAGE with a downward shift in molecular weight. First, we infected macrophages with L. monocytogenes for 0.5 h at 37 °C. At different times post-infection, protein lysates were collected. As shown in Fig. 1A, control cells showed only basal levels of autophagy. However, there was a time-dependent increase in LC3-II expression after infection with the pathogen. Using this antibody, LC3-I was barely detectable because of the lower sensitivity of the presently available anti-LC3 antibodies for LC3-I (39Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). Further, this response was not dependent on the bacterial dose because LC3-II expression increased equally well at a higher multiplicity of infection (Fig. 1A, right panel). As the processing of LC3-I to LC3-II increases, there is a corresponding increase in autophagosome formation (40Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar). We next employed GFP-LC3 to observe this phenomenon. Uninfected macrophages transfected with GFP-LC3 showed diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of the protein (Fig. 1B, left panel). However, after infection with L. monocytogenes, an increase in autophagosomes in the form of GFP-LC3 puncta were observed (Fig. 1B, right panel) that was approximately 4 times more than in control cells (Fig. 1C). We also observed autophagy at the ultrastructure level by electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1D, autophagosomes showing double-membraned structures were observed after infection with L. monocytogenes. LC3-II associates with both the outer and the inner membrane of autophagosomes. As autophagosomes mature by fusion with lysosomes, LC3-II present on the inner membrane of this organelle is also degraded (38Klionsky D.J. Abeliovich H. Agostinis P. Agrawal D.K. Aliev G. Askew D.S.

An increase in LC3-II levels indicates either enhanced autophagosome formation or decreased turnover of LC3-II (or autophagic flux) caused by delayed fusion with lysosomes. To better interpret the increase in LC3-II levels after L. monocytogenes infection, we treated macrophages with chloroquine (CQ), a lysosomotropic agent that inhibits autophagosome fusion with lysosomes and therefore autophagic degradation. As expected, control cells treated with CQ showed an increase in the expression of the lipidated LC3-II form that showed a similar higher trend when infected macrophages were treated with CQ (Fig. 1E), suggesting the presence of an efficient autophagic flux. Infection with L. monocytogenes led to autophagy induction. Thus, we sought to decipher the molecular sensor for host cells that triggers autophagy after L. monocytogenes infection. We first focused on the role of TLR2 in autophagy activation upon L. monocytogenes infection. Macrophages, either wild-type (WT) or Tlr2−/−, were infected with L. monocytogenes, and LC3 lipidation was evaluated by Western blotting (WB) 2 h and 4 h after infection. Cells deficient in TLR2 showed inefficient autophagy induction after infection with L. monocytogenes (Fig. 2A and B). However, a normal autophagic response was induced with rapamycin, a classical inducer of autophagy (Fig. 2A), thus indicating that autophagy induction only in response to L. monocytogenes is compromised in Tlr2−/− cells. TLR4 has no role in L. monocytogenes recognition. In agreement, Tlr4−/− macrophages showed LC3-II induction comparable with that of WT macrophages (Fig. 2, A and B). Further, autophagic flux in control or infected cells, measured after exposure to CQ, was found to be equally efficient (Fig. 2A). We next used GFP-LC3 to determine the formation of autophagosomes in WT and Tlr2−/− cells. Transfection of WT macrophages showed distinct GFP-LC3 punctate structures after infection with L. monocytogenes (Fig. 2C). Consistent with our WB data, the number of GFP-LC3 puncta were markedly reduced in TLR2-deficient cells infected with L. monocytogenes (Fig. 2, C and D). This was not because of reduced uptake, as it was found to be similar in wild-type and Tlr2−/− macrophages (supplemental Fig. S1A). The induction of autophagosome formation was normal when these cells were treated with rapamycin (Fig. 2, C and D). These data demonstrate that autophagy induction upon L. monocytogenes infection is dependent on TLR2 signaling. Soon after its entry into a phagosome within a host cell, L. monocytogenes escapes into the cytosol, where it is recognized by intracellular receptors NOD1 and NOD2 (35Park J.H. Kim Y.G. McDonald C.

To resolve whether any of these cytosolic receptors are required for activation of autophagy, we next infected Nod1−/− or Nod2−/− macrophages with L. monocytogenes and evaluated LC3 lipidation by WB at various times post-infection. Cells that were deficient in either NOD1 or NOD2 showed a marked reduction in autophagy induction. However, these cells showed a normal autophagic response to rapamycin (Fig. 3, A and B). Further, autophagic flux in control or infected cells, measured after exposure to CQ, was found to be equally efficient (Fig. 3A). We next infected GFP-LC3 transfected macrophages with L. monocytogenes. Consistent with our WB data, fewer GFP-LC3 puncta were seen in NOD1- or NOD2- deficient cells infected with L. monocytogenes as compared with WT cells (Fig. 3, C and D). This was not because of reduced uptake, as it was found to be similar in WT and Nod1−/− or Nod2−/− macrophages (supplemental Fig. S1A). The induction of autophagosome formation was normal when Nod1−/− or Nod2−/− cells were treated with rapamycin, indicating that the response is selective for L. monocytogenes infection (Fig. 3, C and D). These results suggest that both NOD1 and NOD2 are essential for induction of autophagy after infection of macrophages with L. monocytogenes. NOD1 and NOD2 signaling pathway involves the downstream adaptor RIP2 kinase. Earlier reports have suggested contradictory results in regard to the role for RIP2 in autophagy induction by stimulation with NOD ligands (42Travassos L.H. Carneiro L.A. Ramjeet M."

We investigated the molecular mechanisms of this physiological heart growth with the goal of applying this knowledge to the mammalian heart. We found that heart growth in pythons is characterized by myocyte hypertrophy in the absence of cell proliferation and by activation of physiological signal transduction pathways. Despite high levels of circulating lipids, the postprandial python heart does not accumulate triglycerides or fatty acids. Instead, there is robust activation of pathways of fatty acid transport and oxidation combined with increased expression and activity of superoxide dismutase, a cardioprotective enzyme. We also identified a combination of fatty acids in python plasma that promotes physiological heart growth when injected into either pythons or mice."

No absorption features, of either silicates or hydrated minerals, have been detected across the observed area in the spectral range from 0.4 to 3.5 micrometers. The surface temperature reaches a maximum value of 245 kelvin and correlates well with topographic features. The thermal inertia is in the range from 20 to 30 joules meter(-2) kelvin(-1) second(-0.5), comparable to a lunarlike powdery regolith. Spectral signatures of surface alteration, resulting from space weathering, seem to be missing. Lutetia is likely a remnant of the primordial planetesimal population, unaltered by differentiation processes and composed of chondritic materials of enstatitic or carbonaceous origin, dominated by iron-poor minerals that have not suffered aqueous alteration."
https://openalex.org/W2019928476,"The nuclear pore complex encloses a central channel for nucleocytoplasmic transport, which is thought to consist of three nucleoporins, Nup54, Nup58, and Nup62. However, the structure and composition of the channel are elusive. We determined the crystal structures of the interacting domains between these nucleoporins and pieced together the molecular architecture of the mammalian transport channel. Located in the channel midplane is a flexible Nup54⋅Nup58 ring that can undergo large rearrangements yielding diameter changes from ∼20 to ∼40 nm. Nup62⋅Nup54 triple helices project alternately up and down from either side of the midplane ring and form nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic entries. The channel consists of as many as 224 copies of the three nucleoporins, amounting to a molar mass of 12.3 MDa and contributing 256 phenylalanine-glycine repeat regions. We propose that the occupancy of these repeat regions with transport receptors modulates ring diameter and transport activity."
https://openalex.org/W1985961137,"Neurons typically settle at positions that match the location of their synaptic targets, creating topographic maps. In the spinal cord, the organization of motor neurons into discrete clusters is linked to the location of their muscle targets, establishing a topographic map of punctate design. To define the significance of motor pool organization for neuromuscular map formation, we assessed the role of cadherin-catenin signaling in motor neuron positioning and limb muscle innervation. We find that joint inactivation of β- and γ-catenin scrambles motor neuron settling position in the spinal cord but fails to erode the predictive link between motor neuron transcriptional identity and muscle target. Inactivation of N-cadherin perturbs pool positioning in similar ways, albeit with reduced penetrance. These findings reveal that cadherin-catenin signaling directs motor pool patterning and imposes topographic order on an underlying identity-based neural map."

https://openalex.org/W2038481897,"Women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at a greater risk of developing and dying from breast cancer than women without T2DM. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia underlie the pathogenesis of T2DM. In the MKR mouse model of insulin resistance, we have previously shown increased activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway in association with accelerated mammary tumor growth. In this study, we demonstrate that inhibiting PI3K with the oral pan-class I PI3K inhibitor, NVP-BKM120 reduced the growth of Met-1 and MCNeuA mammary tumor orthografts in the MKR mouse. NVP-BKM120 treatment decreased phosphorylation of Akt and S6 ribosomal protein (S6rp); no change in Erk1/2 phosphorylation was seen. Hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia and greater hyperinsulinemia developed in the MKR mice treated with NVP-BKM120. We previously reported reduced tumor growth using intraperitoneal rapamycin in the MKR mouse, with the development of hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Therefore, we examined whether the oral PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 augmented the tumor suppressing effects of PI3K inhibition. We also investigated the effect of targeted PI3K/mTOR inhibition on PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Erk1/2 signaling, and the potential effects on glycemia. NVP-BEZ235 suppressed the growth of Met-1 and MCNeuA tumor orthografts, and decreased Akt and S6rp phosphorylation, despite increased Erk1/2 phosphorylation in Met-1 orthografts of MKR mice. Less marked hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia developed with NVP-BEZ235 than NVP-BKM120. Overall, the results of this study demonstrated that inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling with the oral agents NVP-BKM120 and NVP-BEZ235 decreased mammary tumor growth in the hyperinsulinemic MKR mouse. Inhibiting PI3K alone led to more severe metabolic derangement than inhibiting both PI3K and mTOR. Therefore, PI3K may be an important target for the treatment of breast cancer in women with insulin resistance. Monitoring for hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia should be considered when using these agents in humans, given the metabolic changes detected in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2001575881,"The serotonin transporter (SERT) terminates neurotransmission by removing serotonin from the synaptic cleft. In addition, it is the site of action of antidepressants (which block the transporter) and of amphetamines (which induce substrate efflux). The interaction energies involved in binding of such compounds to the transporter are unknown. Here, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to probe single molecular interactions between the serotonin transporter and MFZ2-12 (a potent cocaine analog) in living CHOK1 cells. For the AFM measurements, MFZ2-12 was immobilized on AFM tips by using a heterobifunctional cross-linker. By varying the pulling velocity in force distance cycles drug-transporter complexes were ruptured at different force loadings allowing for mapping of the interaction energy landscape. We derived chemical rate constants from these recordings and compared them with those inferred from inhibition of transport and ligand binding: koff values were in good agreement with those derived from uptake experiments; in contrast, the kon values were scaled down when determined by AFM. Our observations generated new insights into the energy landscape of the interaction between SERT and inhibitors. They thus provide a useful framework for molecular dynamics simulations by exploring the range of forces and energies that operate during the binding reaction."

Hence, normalization of tumor vessels has been reported to improve the effect of immuno-, chemo- and radiation therapy. However, the humoral factors, which can effectively induce maturation of tumor vasculature, have not been elucidated. In this study, we found that the novel peptide apelin and its receptor APJ can induce the morphological and functional maturation of blood vessels in tumors. This apelin-induced tumor vascular maturation enhances the efficacy of cancer dendritic cell-based immunotherapy and significantly suppresses tumor growth by promoting the infiltration of invariant natural killer T cells into the central region of the tumor and thereby robustly inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. Additionally, we showed APJ expression to be enhanced in the tumor endothelium in comparison with normal-state endothelial cells. These findings provide a new target for tumor vascular-specific maturation, which is expected to improve the efficacy of conventional cancer therapies."

ABC transporters translocate a wide variety of substrates across membranes, but their physiological function is often incompletely understood.

We illustrate the power of this simple ""transportomics"" approach using ABCC2, a protein present at sites of uptake and elimination. We identified many new substrates of ABCC2 in urine. These included glucuronides of plant-derived xenobiotics, a class of compounds to which humans are exposed on a daily basis. Moreover, we show that the excretion of these compounds in vivo depends on ABCC2: compared to wild-type mice, the urinary excretion of several glucuronides was increased up to 20-fold in Abcc2(-/-) mice. Transportomics has broad applicability, as it is not restricted to urine and can be applied to other ATP-dependent transport proteins as well."

In eukaryotes, two conserved recombinases, Rad51 and Dmc1, are involved in this reaction; Rad51 functions in both mitotic and meiotic recombination and recombination repair, whereas Dmc1 plays a role only in meiotic recombination (1Krogh B.O.

Budding yeast Rad51, as with other recombinases, forms nucleoprotein filaments on ssDNA in an ATP-dependent manner. The resulting structures are referred to as presynaptic filaments, which are the core structures involved in the DNA strand exchange reaction (5Galkin V.E. Wu Y. Zhang X.P. Qian X. He Y. Yu X.

Thus, recombinases are unable to directly form presynaptic filaments on RPA-coated ssDNA due to the higher affinity of RPA for ssDNA. To efficiently form presynaptic filaments, accessory proteins are needed to overcome the inhibitory effect of RPA. These proteins are called recombination mediators (9Sung P. Klein H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The first mediator to be identified was Rad52, from both the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and humans, which has been shown to assist the Rad51-mediated DNA strand exchange reaction in vitro (11Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 12New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C.

Rad52 physically interacts with Rad51 and RPA and assists Rad51 to displace RPA from ssDNA, leading to the formation of the Rad51 presynaptic filament (14Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31663-31672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although the physical interactions of Rad52 with both RPA and Rad51 are essential for its mediator activity, interestingly, Rad52 itself confers no effect on Rad51 biochemical activities, such as ssDNA- and ATP-binding affinities, which are essential for the DNA strand exchange (15Plate I.

Therefore, the molecular mechanism of how Rad52 overcomes the RPA inhibition and how it assists Rad51 loading onto ssDNA has not been completely elucidated. Several other recombination mediators were later identified, including Rad51 paralogs, such as the S. cerevisiae Rad55-Rad57 complex (17Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) and the human BRCA2 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 2) product(18Sharan S.K. Morimatsu M. Albrecht U. Lim D.S. Regel E. Dinh C.

However, the mechanism by which these mediators assist recombinase-dependent DNA strand exchange remains to be defined. The Swi5-Sfr1 complex, another recombinase mediator, was first identified in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and is evolutionally conserved from yeast to humans (19Akamatsu Y.

Swi5 and Sfr1 from S. pombe consist of 85 and 299 amino acids, respectively, and form a very stable complex. This complex stimulates both Rad51- and Dmc1-mediated strand exchange reactions when recombinases are incubated with ssDNA before the addition of RPA (24Haruta N. Kurokawa Y. Murayama Y. Akamatsu Y. Unzai S. Tsutsui Y. Iwasaki H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, when recombinases are incubated after the addition of RPA, the strand exchange is inhibited even in the presence of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex because Rad51 cannot form presynaptic filaments on ssDNA already coated with RPA. Rad22 (fission yeast homolog of Rad52) is required for this situation. Note that the addition of Rad22 alone is unable to stimulate Rad51-mediated strand exchange in the absence of Swi5-Sfr1, nor has it any effect on the intrinsic ssDNA-dependent ATPase- and ssDNA-binding activities of Rad51 (25Kurokawa Y. Murayama Y. Haruta-Takahashi N. Urabe I. Iwasaki H. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e88Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex, which is able to bind to Rad51 protomers and the Rad51 presynaptic filament, stimulates directly Rad51-mediated displacement of RPA from ssDNA in the presence of Rad22 (24Haruta N. Kurokawa Y. Murayama Y. Akamatsu Y. Unzai S. Tsutsui Y. Iwasaki H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 25Kurokawa Y. Murayama Y. Haruta-Takahashi N. Urabe I. Iwasaki H. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e88Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex stabilizes the presynaptic Rad51 filament on ssDNA in an ATP-dependent manner, likely by decreasing the off-rate of Rad51 from ssDNA (25Kurokawa Y. Murayama Y. Haruta-Takahashi N. Urabe I. Iwasaki H. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e88Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that at least two different types of accessory proteins are required for full recombination activity: Rad22, which targets Rad51 to RPA-coated ssDNA, and Swi5-Sfr1, which activates the intrinsic strand exchange ability of the recombinase filament (25Kurokawa Y. Murayama Y. Haruta-Takahashi N. Urabe I. Iwasaki H. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e88Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, Swi5-Sfr1 is considered to be the first recombinase activator that acts directly on the presynaptic recombinase filament. To understand the molecular mechanism of how Swi5-Sfr1 activates the intrinsic activity of Rad51 and stimulates Rad51-mediated strand exchange, we took multiple approaches, including analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), in this study. Active and inactive filament structures consisting of the 10 Rad51 monomers were reconstituted in silico based on the known structures of the S. cerevisiae Rad51 monomer (26Chen J. Villanueva N. Rould M.A. Morrical S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 4889-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and RecA filaments (7Chen Z. Yang H. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2008; 453: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). On the basis of the results combined with the structural information, we propose a model in which the Swi5-Sfr1 complex fits into the groove of the Rad51 filament, leading to an active and stable presynaptic filament. The expression and purification of Swi5-Sfr1 were previously described by Kuwabara et al. (27Kuwabara N. Hashimoto H. Yamada N. Unzai S. Ikeguchi M. Sato M. Murayama Y. Iwasaki H. Shimizu T.

AUC was performed with an Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) with a An-50 Ti rotor (Beckman). For sedimentation velocity AUC experiments, cells with a standard Epon two-channel centerpiece and sapphire windows were used. The sample (400 μl) and reference (420 μl) buffers were loaded into the cells. The rotor temperature was equilibrated at 20 °C in the vacuum chamber for 1–2 h before startup. Absorbance (A280) scans were collected at 10-min intervals during sedimentation at 50 × 103 rpm. The concentrations of the loaded protein solutions in the experiments were 2.7 and 0.6 mg/ml in reference buffer (10 mm Hepes, 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.0), and 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine). The partial specific volume of the protein, solvent density, and solvent viscosity were calculated from standard tables using the SEDNTERP program (Version 1.09) (28Laue T.M. Shah B. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton L.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992: 90-125Google Scholar). The resulting scans were analyzed using the continuous distribution (c(s)) analysis module in the SEDFIT program (Version 12.1) (29Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1096-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Sedimentation coefficient increments of 200 were used in the appropriate range for each sample. The frictional coefficient was allowed to float during fitting. The weight average sedimentation coefficient was obtained by integrating the range of sedimentation coefficients in which peaks were present. The s20,w value, the sedimentation coefficient corrected to 20 °C in pure water, was calculated from the observed sedimentation coefficient value. The c(s) distribution was converted to a c(s20,w) distribution using the SEDFIT program. Sedimentation equilibrium AUC experiments were performed in a six-channel centerpiece with quartz windows. The absorbance wavelength was set at 280 nm, and data were acquired at 20 °C. The concentrations of the loaded protein solutions in the sedimentation equilibrium experiments were 0.4, 0.9, and 1.8 mg/ml in reference buffer. Data were obtained at 8.5 × 103, 12 × 103, and 16 × 103 rpm, respectively. A total equilibration time of 20 h was used for each speed, with a scan taken at 16 and 18 h to ensure that equilibrium had been reached. The optical base line was determined by accelerating at 42 × 103 rpm at the end of data collection. Data analysis was performed by global analysis with Ultraspin software (Medical Research Council Center for Protein Engineering, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Prior to ESI-MS, the sample buffer was exchanged for an ammonium acetate buffer by dialysis. A sample was dialyzed against 100 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.8) with a microdialysis tool (Micro-dialyzer TOR-14K, Nippon Genetics Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) using a dialysis cup with a membrane that had a molecular mass cutoff of 14,000 Da. The sample solution was then diluted with concentrated ammonium acetate, resulting in 10 μm proteins in 2 m ammonium acetate (pH 6.8). An aliquot of 3 μl of the sample solution was deposited in a nano-ESI spray tip (Waters) and placed in the nanoelectrospray ion source. ESI mass spectra were obtained using a Q-Tof 2 mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. To observe noncovalently bound complexes, the pressure in the quadrupole ion guide of the Q-Tof 2 spectrometer was maintained at 8 × 10−3 pascals by throttling down the SpeediValve fitted to the rotary pump for the ion source region. MassLynx Version 4.1 software (Waters) was used for data processing and peak integration. Mice were immunized with the purified Swi5-Sfr1 protein complex. After generating hybridomas, candidate clones were screened by ELISA using plates. Epitopes of the positive clones were mapped by immunoblotting using lysates of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing serial Sfr1 truncation proteins. Clones 7, 19, 49, and 65 recognized amino acids 31–35, 156–160, 1–5, and 76–80 of Sfr1, respectively (see details under “Results”). Cells of these clones (hybridomas) were grown in PFHM-II medium (Invitrogen), and IgGs were purified by passing the supernatants through HiTrap protein A-Sepharose FF (GE Healthcare). The purified IgG was digested with papain, and the resultant Fab fragments were purified by gel filtration chromatography. The purified Fab fragments from clones 7, 19, 49, and 65 were designated as Fab(31–35), Fab(156–160), Fab(1–5), and Fab(76–80), respectively. A reaction mixture (1.5 ml) containing the purified Swi5-Sfr1 complex (1.2 mg) and Fab fragments (1.415 mg) in gel filtration buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.2 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 17 μg/ml leupeptin) was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The sample was concentrated to a volume of 250 μl with an Amicon Ultra concentrator (Millipore), loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with gel filtration buffer, and developed using the same buffer. In each sample, 1 ml of peak fraction was collected, followed by the addition of 34 μl of 10 mg/ml leupeptin. SAXS measurements were carried out at RIKEN structural biology beamline I (BL45XU) at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) (30Fujisawa T. Inoue K. Oka T. Iwamoto H. Uruga T. Kumasaka T. Inoko Y. Yagi N. Yamamoto M. Ueki T. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 797-800Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Scattering intensities were measured with an R-AXIS IV++ imaging plate detector (Rigaku) at 20 °C with a sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, which was then calibrated by the powder diffraction from silver docosanoate. A circular averaging of the scattering intensities was then performed to obtain one-dimensional scattering data (I(q)) as a function of q (q = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle and the x-ray wavelength (λ) = 0.9 Å). To correct interparticle interference effect, I(q) data were collected at two or three concentrations for the Swi5-Sfr1 and Swi5-Sfr1-Fab complexes (i.e. 1.3, 2.1, and 4.7 mg/ml for Swi5-Sfr1; 1.0, 2.7, and 4.3 mg/ml for Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(1–5); 1.8, 2.7, and 3.8 mg/ml for Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(31–35); 1.5 and 2.5 mg/ml for Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(76–80); and 1.5, 3.8, and 5.8 mg/ml for Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(156–160)) in 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.2 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 357 μg/ml leupeptin. The radius of gyration (Rg) was estimated by fitting I(q) data using Guinier approximation, I(q) = I(0)exp(−q2Rg2/3), where I(0) is the forward scattering at zero scattering angle, in a smaller angle region of qRg < 1.3 by the program PRIMUS (31Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). The distance distribution function (P(r)) was calculated using the program GNOM (32Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). The maximum length (Dmax) was estimated from the P(r) function as the distance r, where P(r) = 0 (33Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar). An ab initio low resolution dummy residue model was built with the program GASBOR with no symmetrical restraint (34Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). The model building was repeated 20 times, and dummy residue models were averaged using the program DAMAVER to obtain general structural information about the proteins (35Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). A protomer of Rad51 was modeled with the program MODELLER (36Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) using the crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Rad51 (Protein Data Bank code 3LDA) (26Chen J. Villanueva N. Rould M.A. Morrical S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 4889-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as a reference structure. Then, the active filament of Rad51 was constructed by aligning the core domains of Rad51 with those of RecA in the crystal structure of the RecA-ssDNA active filament (Protein Data Bank code 3CMW) (7Chen Z. Yang H. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2008; 453: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The dummy residue model of Swi5-Sfr1 was docked onto the modeled active filament of Rad51 manually. For the construction of the Rad51 inactive filament, the crystal structure of the RecA inactive filament (Protein Data Bank code 1XMS) (37Xing X. Bell C.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16142-16152Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used as a reference. First, we examined the sphericity of Swi5-Sfr1 using sedimentation velocity AUC. Fig. 1A shows the distribution of sedimentation coefficients of Swi5-Sfr1 at concentrations of 2.7 and 0.6 mg/ml. The c(s20,w) distribution of Swi5-Sfr1 showed the presence of a single species in solution with a sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of 2.4 ± 0.1 S. The c(s20,w) distribution also did not show any significant change at different protein concentrations, suggesting that Swi5-Sfr1 is monodisperse in solution. The frictional ratio (f/f0) was 2.0 ± 0.2, indicating that the Swi5-Sfr1 complex is not spherical. This result prompted us to measure the SAXS of Swi5-Sfr1 to obtain a solution structure of the complex, as described below. The sedimentation equilibrium AUC experiments estimated the molecular mass of Swi5-Sfr1 to be 45.0 ± 0.1 kDa using a simple monomeric analysis model (Fig. 1B). This value corresponds to a 1:1 binding stoichiometry of Swi5-Sfr1. However, this value differs from the 2:1 stoichiometry of Swi5-Sfr1 reported previously (24Haruta N. Kurokawa Y. Murayama Y. Akamatsu Y. Unzai S. Tsutsui Y. Iwasaki H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be due to the different reducing conditions used in the buffers. We found that a reducing reagent of low efficiency, which was used in the previous study (24Haruta N. Kurokawa Y. Murayama Y. Akamatsu Y. Unzai S. Tsutsui Y. Iwasaki H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), resulted in an association of the Swi5 subunit. When freshly prepared DTT or tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, a more stable reducing agent than DTT, was used in the buffers, the sedimentation equilibrium AUC results indicated that Swi5-Sfr1 exhibits a 1:1 binding stoichiometry, as described above. Therefore, we adopted this 1:1 ratio as the correct binding stoichiometry under physiological conditions. However, considering the relatively small molecular mass of a single Swi5 molecule (9.7 kDa), uncertainty in the binding stoichiometry remained. Therefore, to obtain the conclusive stoichiometry, we decided to conduct ESI-MS experiments, which are capable of accurately measuring the molecular mass of proteins. As shown in Fig. 2, multiply charged ions of compound A with a mass of 43,254.4 ± 0.9 Da represented the predominant peaks, whereas minor peaks corresponding to the molecular masses of compounds B (33,506.9 ± 1.1 Da) and C (19,495.0 ± 0.6 Da) were also identified. The theoretical molecular masses of the monomeric Sfr1 peptide with and without the N-terminal Met were calculated to be 33,637.9 and 33,506.7 Da, respectively, and the corresponding 13+ and 12+ charged ions of free Sfr1 are shown in Fig. 2. The major peaks observed in the mass spectrum correspond to 13+∼16+ charged ions of the 1:1 complex of Swi5-Sfr1, whose theoretical mass is 43,254.8 Da. The two peaks labeled C8+ and C9+ suggest that some of the Swi5 population with a theoretical molecular mass of 9748.1 Da exists as a dimer. In the high m/z region of Fig. 2, no significant peak was observed that would suggest a binding stoichiometry other than 1:1. Accordingly, we conclude that Swi5 and Sfr1 preferentially form a 1:1 complex, not a 2:1 complex. The SAXS profile and overall parameters of Swi5-Sfr1 are shown in Fig. 3A and Table 1, respectively. The radius of gyration (Rg) of Swi5-Sfr1 was 49.0 Å (Table 1), and the P(r) function of Swi5-Sfr1 has a broad peak at 30–60 Å (Fig. 3B). The maximum length (Dmax) of Swi5-Sfr1 was estimated to be 178 Å (Table 1). The dummy residue model of Swi5-Sfr1 constructed by the program GASBOR (34Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar) has a substantially elongated shape, as shown in Fig. 4A. It had been previously reported that limited proteolysis produces a stable C-terminal fragment that lacks 177 amino acids from the N terminus (Sfr1ΔN177) (27Kuwabara N. Hashimoto H. Yamada N. Unzai S. Ikeguchi M. Sato M. Murayama Y. Iwasaki H. Shimizu T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 1124-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For comparison, Fig. 4B shows the dummy residue model of the Swi5-Sfr1ΔN177 complex. Notably, half of the Swi5-Sfr1 model resembles the Swi5-Sfr1ΔN177 model in size and shape (Fig. 4).TABLE 1Radii of gyration (Rg) and maximum lengths (Dmax) of the Swi5-Sfr1 and Swi5-Sfr1-Fab complexes estimated using SAXSComplexRgDmaxÅÅSwi5-Sfr149.0178Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(1–5)66.1235Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(31–35)54.4212Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(76–80)52.5197Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(156–160)51.3176 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4Dummy residue models of the Swi5-Sfr1 and Swi5-Sfr1ΔN177 complexes.

To this end, we generated monoclonal antibodies by immunizing mice with the Swi5-Sfr1 complex as an antigen. Hybridomas were screened by ELISA, and the positive clones were further analyzed by immunoblotting using purified Swi5-Sfr1 as targets. To determine the recognition sequence of each monoclonal antibody, we made a series of plasmid-based truncation constructs of the Sfr1 protein (40 constructs) in which every five amino acid residues were truncated from the N terminus and expressed in a T7 expression system (supplemental Fig. S1). Using these lysates as target antigens, the recognition sequence of each monoclonal antibody was mapped. Of the positive clones, we selected four clones (7, 19, 49, and 65) that recognized Sfr1 amino acids 31–35, 156–160, 1–5, and 76–80, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1). From these hybridomas, Fab fragments were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Fab fragments from clones 7, 19, 49, and 65 were designated as Fab(31–35), Fab(156–160), Fab(1–5), and Fab(76–80), respectively. To investigate whether the obtained Fab fragments formed stable complexes with Swi5-Sfr1, we performed gel filtration chromatography (supplemental Fig. S2). The Swi5-Sfr1 complex alone eluted at ∼13 ml of elution volume, whereas all four of the samples containing both Swi5-Sfr1 and Fab fragments showed single peaks at ∼12 ml of elution volume, indicating that a stable complex had formed between Swi5-Sfr1 and each Fab fragment. These complexes were then used for subsequent SAXS analysis. The SAXS profiles for the four Swi5-Sfr1-Fab complexes are shown in Fig. 5A, and the Rg and Dmax of the Swi5-Sfr1-Fab complexes are summarized in Table 1. Among the four complexes, Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(1–5) showed the largest Rg of 66.1 Å, and the Rg decreased in the order of Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(1–5), Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(31–35), Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(76–80), and Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(156–160). The Dmax of the four complexes also exhibited the same order as Rg, and the Dmax of Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(156–160) was comparable with that of Swi5-Sfr1. The P(r) functions for the four complexes also differed significantly from one another (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that the Fab fragments bind to Swi5-Sfr1 from the distal position to the center of Swi5-Sfr1 in the following order: Fab(1–5), Fab(31–35), Fab(76–80), and Fab(156–160). The Rg, Dmax, and P(r) functions of the four Swi5-Sfr1-Fab complexes provided rough topological information about the N-terminal half of Sfr1 in the Swi5-Sfr1 complex. To further assess the topology of Sfr1 in the complex, we constructed dummy residue models of the four Swi5-Sfr1-Fab complexes (Fig. 6B). However, the dummy residue models obtained from independent runs of the program GASBOR (34Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar) for each Swi5-Sfr1-Fab complex could not be used to determine general structural features about the complexes because the models were too unstable to be averaged by the program DAMAVER (35Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). Instead, we analyzed the binding sites of the Fab fragments as follows. First, the principal axes of the dummy residue models of the Swi5-Sfr1-Fab complexes were calculated. For each model, the longest axis (i.e. corresponding to the smallest principal moment of inertia) was aligned with the x axis, and the number of the dummy residues with x coordinates in the range of iΔx to (i + 1)Δx was counted along the x axis, where i is an integer and Δx was set to 1 Å. The origin was designated as the end located at the smaller half of each model. The numbers of dummy residues along the x axis were averaged for all models. In Fig. 6A, the average numbers of dummy residues along the x axis are plotted for each complex. Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(1–5) has a dummy residue distribution peak at around x = 170–220 Å, indicating that Fab(1–5) is bound to the periphery of Swi5-Sfr1, leading to an increase in the Dmax of Swi5-Sfr1. In Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(31–35) and Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(76–80), broad peaks of the dummy residue distribution appear at around x = 110–210 and 90–200 Å, respectively, which are significantly shorter compared with Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(1–5). The dummy residue distribution of Swi5-Sfr1-Fab(156–160) appears at around x = 85–175 Å and has a broad peak at the shortest x value among the four Fab complexes. Consequently, the binding sites are located from the end to the middle of the Swi5-Sfr1 structure in the following order: 1–5, 31–35, 76–80, and 156–160. This is supported by the fact that the Swi5-Sfr1ΔN177 complex resembles half of the model of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex. These results demonstrate that Sfr1 is positioned within the Swi5-Sfr1 complex according to the topology shown in Fig. 6C. An atomic structure of the S. pombe Rad51 protomer was modeled with the program MODELLER (36Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) using the crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Rad51 (Protein Data Bank code 3LDA) (26Chen J. Villanueva N. Rould M.A. Morrical S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 4889-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as a reference structure. Recombinase filaments typically adopt two structures: active and inactive. In the active form, the filament is elongated and has wider grooves, whereas in the inactive form, the filament is a compressed helix with narrower grooves (25Kurokawa Y. Murayama Y. Haruta-Takahashi N. Urabe I. Iwasaki H. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e88Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The active Rad51 filament was constructed by aligning the core domains of Rad51 with those of RecA from the crystal structure of the RecA-ssDNA active filament (Protein Data Bank code 3CMW) (26Chen J. Villanueva N. Rould M.A. Morrical S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 4889-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For the construction of the Rad51 inactive filament, the crystal structure of the RecA inactive filament (Protein Data Bank code 1XMS) (34Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar) was used. The two filament models constructed are consistent with those proposed by electron microscopy (3Masson J.Y. West S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 131-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Next, the dummy residue model of Swi5-Sfr1 was docked onto the modeled Rad51 filaments manually. Surprisingly, the dummy residue model of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex showed that the dogleg-like shape of the C terminus fits well into the wide groove of the active Rad51 filament (Fig. 7A). The N-terminal domain of the Sfr1 does not enter the groove but plasters itself against the filament. In contrast, the groove of the Rad51 filament in the inactive form is too narrow for the Swi5-Sfr1 complex to enter (Fig. 7B). Thus, because the pitch of the Rad51 filament would be altered as ATP is hydrolyzed, we suggest that the Swi5-Sfr1 complex serves to preserve the ATP-bound active form of the Rad51 filament. Additionally, this model suggests that one Swi5-Sfr1 complex binds to ∼10 Rad51 molecules, which corresponds to the optimum stoichiometry of Rad51 to Swi5-Sfr1 (10:1–20:1) indicated by previous biochemical experiments. When the concentration of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex is increased to more than the optimum concentrations, the activity of strand exchange is significantly reduced (24Haruta N. Kurokawa Y. Murayama Y. Akamatsu Y. Unzai S. Tsutsui Y. Iwasaki H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). At high concentrations of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex, the complex would completely mask the groove of the Rad51 filament, resulting in impairment of the binding of incoming dsDNA. In vivo, the amount of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex in cells is small (20Akamatsu Y. Tsutsui Y. Morishita T. Siddique M.S. Kurokawa Y. Ikeguchi M. Yamao F. Arcangioli B. Iwasaki H. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1352-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and there is the possibility of additional factor(s) that regulate(s) the local concentrations of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex in cells. Intrinsically disordered protein prediction (DISOPRED) (38Ward J.J. Sodhi J.S. McGuffin L.J. Buxton B.F. Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar) indicates that the N-terminal half of Sfr1 has high intrinsically disordered protein propensity (supplemental Fig. S3). This prediction is consistent with the following three observations. (a) Limited proteolysis produced a stable C-terminal half-fragment (Sfr1ΔN177) by cleavage of the N-terminal region of Sfr1 (27Kuwabara N. Hashimoto H. Yamada N. Unzai S. Ikeguchi M. Sato M. Murayama Y. Iwasaki H. Shimizu T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 1124-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); (b) Fab-binding sites were mapped from the N-terminal to the central region of Sfr1; and (c) the full-length Swi5-Sfr1 complex could not be crystallized, whereas the crystallization of Swi5 in complex with a 180-amino acid N-terminal deletion mutant of Sfr1 (Sfr1ΔN180) or Sfr1C (Swi5-Sfr1C) was completed successfully (27Kuwabara N. Hashimoto H. Yamada N. Unzai S. Ikeguchi M. Sato M. Murayama Y. Iwasaki H. Shimizu T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 1124-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Swi5-Sfr1C superimposed well onto the dummy residue model of the Swi5-Sfr1ΔN177 complex and the half of the full-length Swi5-Sfr1 model in Fig. 4. 3N. Kuwabara and T. Shimizu, unpublished data. Although Swi5-Sfr1C possesses the essential ability to stimulate strand exchange, Swi5-Sfr1C requires a concentration 10 times greater than that of the full-length Swi5-Sfr1 complex to achieve the same level of strand exchange activity. 4Y. Murayama, Y. Tsutsui, and H. Iwasaki, unpublished data. Additionally, the Sfr1 N-terminal half exhibits DNA-binding activity.4 These observations indicate that the N-terminal half of Sfr1 makes important contributions to the function of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex. Therefore, the solution structure analysis of the full-length Swi5-Sfr1 complex is crucial for the structural investigation of Swi5-Sfr1. If a rigid structure of the Sfr1 N-terminal region is induced upon binding to DNA, Fab fragments that specifically bind to the N-terminal region may inhibit Swi5-Sfr1 functions. Additional experimentation will be required to test this hypothesis. In this study, we investigated the structure of the full-length Swi5-Sfr1 complex using multiple approaches, including AUC, ESI-MS, and SAXS. We found that Swi5-Sfr1 forms a 1:1 complex and exhibits an extremely elongated dogleg-shaped structure in solution. Taken together, the results lead to a working model for the Swi5-Sfr1 complex, where the Rad51 presynaptic filament is stabilized and activated by the Swi5-Sfr1 complex. Because Swi5 and Sfr1 are widely conserved from yeast to humans, structural insights of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex in S. pombe will be relevant for understanding the structure and function of orthologs in other species. We also showed in this study that SAXS analysis using Fab fragments is a powerful tool for predicting overall protein topology. The methodology developed in this study may be widely applicable for determining the structure of other multisubunit supramolecular complexes in solution."
https://openalex.org/W2035814116,"α-Linked xylose is a major component of xyloglucans in the cell walls of higher plants. An α-xylosidase (AxlA) was purified from a commercial enzyme preparation from Aspergillus niger, and the encoding gene was identified. The protein is a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 31. It was active on p-nitrophenyl-α-d-xyloside, isoprimeverose, xyloglucan heptasaccharide (XXXG), and tamarind xyloglucan. When expressed in Pichia pastoris, AxlA had activity comparable to the native enzyme on pNPαX and IP despite apparent hyperglycosylation. The pH optimum of AxlA was between 3.0 and 4.0. AxlA together with β-glucosidase depolymerized xyloglucan heptasaccharide. A combination of AxlA, β-glucosidase, xyloglucanase, and β-galactosidase in the optimal proportions of 51:5:19:25 or 59:5:11:25 could completely depolymerize tamarind XG to free Glc or Xyl, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a secreted microbial α-xylosidase. Secreted α-xylosidases appear to be rare in nature, being absent from other tested commercial enzyme mixtures and from the genomes of most filamentous fungi. α-Linked xylose is a major component of xyloglucans in the cell walls of higher plants. An α-xylosidase (AxlA) was purified from a commercial enzyme preparation from Aspergillus niger, and the encoding gene was identified. The protein is a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 31. It was active on p-nitrophenyl-α-d-xyloside, isoprimeverose, xyloglucan heptasaccharide (XXXG), and tamarind xyloglucan.

https://openalex.org/W2067985706,"PDZ domains are well known protein-protein interaction modules that, as part of multidomain proteins, assemble molecular complexes. Some PDZ domains have been reported to interact with membrane lipids, in particular phosphatidylinositol phosphates, but few studies have been aimed at elucidating the prevalence or the molecular details of such interactions. We screened 46 Drosophila PDZ domains for phosphoinositide-dependent cellular localization and discovered that the second PDZ domain of polychaetoid (Pyd PDZ2) interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)) at the plasma membrane. Surface plasmon resonance binding experiments with recombinant protein established that Pyd PDZ2 interacts with phosphatidylinositol phosphates with apparent affinities in the micromolar range. Electrostatic interactions involving an extended positively charged surface of Pyd PDZ2 are crucial for the PtdIns(4,5)P(2)-dependent membrane interactions as shown by a combination of three-dimensional modeling, mutagenesis, binding, and localization studies. In vivo localization studies further suggested that both lipid and peptide binding contribute to membrane localization. We identified the transmembrane protein Crumbs as a Pyd PDZ2 ligand and probed the relation between peptide and PtdIns(4,5)P(2) binding. Contrary to the prevalent view on PDZ/peptide/lipid binding, we did not find competition between peptide and lipid ligands. Instead, preloading the protein with the 10-mer Crb3 peptide increased the apparent affinity of Pyd PDZ2 for PtdIns(4,5)P(2) 6-fold. Our results suggest that membrane localization of Pyd PDZ2 may be driven by a combination of peptide and PtdIns(4,5)P(2) binding, which raises the intriguing possibility that the domain may coordinate protein- and phospholipid-mediated signals."
