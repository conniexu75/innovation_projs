https://openalex.org/W2971541306,"Tau is an abundant microtubule-associated protein in neurons. Tau aggregation into insoluble fibrils is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia1, yet the physiological state of tau molecules within cells remains unclear. Using single-molecule imaging, we directly observe that the microtubule lattice regulates reversible tau self-association, leading to localized, dynamic condensation of tau molecules on the microtubule surface. Tau condensates form selectively permissible barriers, spatially regulating the activity of microtubule-severing enzymes and the movement of molecular motors through their boundaries. We propose that reversible self-association of tau molecules, gated by the microtubule lattice, is an important mechanism of the biological functions of tau, and that oligomerization of tau is a common property shared between the physiological and disease-associated forms of the molecule. Tan et al. and Siahaan et al. present distinct but complementary data showing that microtubule regulates dynamic condensation of tau molecules, and this in turn affects microtubule biology and function."
https://openalex.org/W2971448217,"Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein, which diffuses on microtubules1. In neurodegenerative diseases, collectively termed tauopathies, malfunction of tau and its detachment from axonal microtubules are correlated with axonal degeneration2. Tau can protect microtubules from microtubule-degrading enzymes such as katanin3. However, how tau carries out this regulatory function is still unclear. Here, using in vitro reconstitution, we show that tau molecules on microtubules cooperatively form cohesive islands that are kinetically distinct from tau molecules that individually diffuse on microtubules. Dependent on the tau concentration in solution, the islands reversibly grow or shrink by addition or release of tau molecules at their boundaries. Shielding microtubules from kinesin-1 motors and katanin, the islands exhibit regulatory qualities distinct from a comparably dense layer of diffusible tau. Superprocessive kinesin-8 motors penetrate the islands and cause their disassembly. Our results reveal a microtubule-dependent phase of tau that constitutes an adaptable protective layer on the microtubule surface. We anticipate that other intrinsically disordered axonal proteins display a similar cooperative behaviour and potentially compete with tau in regulating access to the microtubule surface."

https://openalex.org/W2971811688,"The inner centromere is a region on every mitotic chromosome that enables specific biochemical reactions that underlie properties, such as the maintenance of cohesion, the regulation of kinetochores and the assembly of specialized chromatin, that can resist microtubule pulling forces. The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) is abundantly localized to the inner centromeres and it is unclear whether it is involved in non-kinase activities that contribute to the generation of these unique chromatin properties. We find that the borealin subunit of the CPC drives phase separation of the CPC in vitro at concentrations that are below those found on the inner centromere. We also provide strong evidence that the CPC exists in a phase-separated state at the inner centromere. CPC phase separation is required for its inner-centromere localization and function during mitosis. We suggest that the CPC combines phase separation, kinase and histone code-reading activities to enable the formation of a chromatin body with unique biochemical activities at the inner centromere."
https://openalex.org/W2972002502,"The classical model of tissue renewal posits that small numbers of quiescent stem cells (SCs) give rise to proliferating transit-amplifying cells before terminal differentiation. However, many organs house pools of SCs with proliferative and differentiation potentials that diverge from this template. Resolving SC identity and organization is therefore central to understanding tissue renewal. Here, using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), mouse genetics and tissue injury approaches, we uncover cellular hierarchies and mechanisms that underlie the maintenance and repair of the continuously growing mouse incisor. Our results reveal that, during homeostasis, a group of actively cycling epithelial progenitors generates enamel-producing ameloblasts and adjacent layers of non-ameloblast cells. After injury, tissue repair was achieved through transient increases in progenitor-cell proliferation and through direct conversion of Notch1-expressing cells to ameloblasts. We elucidate epithelial SC identity, position and function, providing a mechanistic basis for the homeostasis and repair of a fast-turnover ectodermal appendage."
https://openalex.org/W2971736312,"Background In 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began covering a multitarget stool DNA (mtSDNA) test for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening of Medicare beneficiaries. In this study, we evaluated whether mtSDNA testing is a cost-effective alternative to other CRC screening strategies reimbursed by CMS, and if not, under what conditions it could be. Methods We use three independently-developed microsimulation models to simulate a cohort of previously unscreened US 65-year-olds who are screened with triennial mtSDNA testing, or one of six other reimbursed screening strategies. Main outcome measures are discounted life-years gained (LYG) and lifetime costs (CMS perspective), threshold reimbursement rates, and threshold adherence rates. Outcomes are expressed as the median and range across models. Results Compared to no screening, triennial mtSDNA screening resulted in 82 (range: 79–88) LYG per 1,000 simulated individuals. This was more than for five-yearly sigmoidoscopy (80 (range: 71–89) LYG), but fewer than for every other simulated strategy. At its 2017 reimbursement rate of $512, mtSDNA was the most costly strategy, and even if adherence were 30% higher than with other strategies, it would not be a cost-effective alternative. At a substantially reduced reimbursement rate ($6–18), two models found that triennial mtSDNA testing was an efficient and potentially cost-effective screening option. Conclusions Compared to no screening, triennial mtSDNA screening reduces CRC incidence and mortality at acceptable costs. However, compared to nearly all other CRC screening strategies reimbursed by CMS it is less effective and considerably more costly, making it an inefficient screening option."

https://openalex.org/W2971449933,"A recent large-scale welfare study in North America involving 106 Asian (Elephas maximus) and 131 African (Loxodonta africana) elephants at 64 accredited facilities identified links (i.e., risk factors) between zoo environmental factors and a number of welfare outcomes (stereotypic behavior, ovarian acyclicity, hyperprolactinemia, walking and recumbence, body condition, health status, serum cortisol). For this population of elephants, we used the same epidemiological methods to examine associations between those risk factors and two additional welfare outcomes, mean concentration and individual variability (CV) of fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations (FGM) as indicators of stress. Results indicate that African elephants are more responsive to social stressors than Asians, and that poor joint health is a stress-related welfare problem for Asian, but not African elephants in the North American population. For both species, higher FGM concentrations were associated with zoos located at more northern latitudes, whereas lower FGM concentrations were associated with having free access to indoor/outdoor spaces, and spending more time in managed interactions with staff. Also important for captive management, elephants having diverse enrichment options and belonging to compatible social groups exhibited reduced intra-individual variability in FGM concentrations. Our findings show that aspects of the zoo environment can be potential sources of stress for captive elephants, and that there are management activities that may facilitate coping with zoo conditions. Given species differences in factors that affected FGM, targeted, species-specific management approaches likely are needed to ensure good welfare for all elephants."
https://openalex.org/W2971637062,"Background Jamestown, an urban coastal slum in Accra, Ghana, has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the country. We sought to understand the decision (to keep or terminate) factors and experiences surrounding adolescent pregnancies. Methods Thirty semi-structured indepth interviews were carried out among adolescents (aged 13–19 years) who had been pregnant at least once. Half of these were adolescent mothers and the other half had at least one past experience of induced abortion. A pretested and validated questionnaire to assess the awareness and use of contraception in adolescent participants was also administered. To aid social contextualization, semi-structured in depth interviews were carried out among 23 purposively selected stakeholders. Results The main role players in decision making included family, friends, school teachers and the partner, with pregnant adolescents playing the most prominent role. Adolescents showed a high degree of certainty in deciding to either abort or carry pregnancies to term. Interestingly, religious considerations were rarely taken into account. Although almost all adolescents (96.1%) were aware of contraception, none was using any prior to getting pregnant. Of the 15 adolescents who had had abortion experiences, 13 (87.0%) were carried out under unsafe circumstances. The main barriers to accessing safe abortion services included poor awareness of the fairly liberal nature of the Ghanaian abortion law, stigma, high cost and non-harmonization of safe abortion service fees, negative abortion experiences (death and bleeding), and distrust in the health care providers. Adolescents who chose to continue their pregnancies to term were motivated by personal and sociocultural factors. Conclusion Decision-making in adolescent pregnancies is influenced by multiple external factors, many of which are modifiable. Despite legal access to services, options for the safe termination of pregnancy or its prevention are not predominantly taken, resulting in a high number of negative experiences and outcomes. Including safe abortion care within the sexual and reproductive health package, could diminish barriers to safe abortion services. Given the vulnerability of the Jamestown setting, a comprehensive sexual education package that addresses the main decision factors is recommended. Interventions aiming to reduce adolescent pregnancy rates should also recognize that adolescent pregnancies are culturally acceptable in some settings, and under certain circumstances, are desired by the adolescents themselves."
https://openalex.org/W2972244201,"The environment receives antibiotics through a combination of direct application (e.g., aquaculture and fruit production), as well as indirect release through pharmaceutical manufacturing, sewage and animal manure. Antibiotic concentrations in many sewage-impacted rivers are thought to be sufficient to select for antibiotic resistance genes. Yet, because antibiotics are nearly always found associated with antibiotic-resistant faecal bacteria in wastewater, it is difficult to distinguish the selective role of effluent antibiotics within a ‘sea’ of gut-derived resistance genes. Here we examine the potential for macrolide and fluoroquinolone prescribing in England to select for resistance in the River Thames catchment, England. We show that 64% and 74% of the length of the modelled catchment is chronically exposed to putative resistance-selecting concentrations (PNEC) of macrolides and fluoroquinolones, respectively. Under current macrolide usage, 115 km of the modelled River Thames catchment (8% of total length) exceeds the PNEC by 5-fold. Similarly, under current fluoroquinolone usage, 223 km of the modelled River Thames catchment (16% of total length) exceeds the PNEC by 5-fold. Our results reveal that if reduced prescribing was the sole mitigating measure, that macrolide and fluoroquinolone prescribing would need to decline by 77% and 85%, respectively, to limit resistance selection in the catchment. Significant reductions in antibiotic prescribing are feasible, but innovation in sewage-treatment will be necessary for achieving substantially-reduced antibiotic loads and inactivation of DNA-pollution from resistant bacteria. Greater confidence is needed in current risk-based targets for antibiotics, particularly in mixtures, to better inform environmental risk assessments and mitigation."
https://openalex.org/W1532243656,"We study in-group favouritism and out-group discrimination in a multiplayer dictator game in a naturally occuring group setting. An allocator divides a large sum of money among three groups of around 20 recipients each and also to themselves. The groups are supporters of two rival political movements in Thailand and politically neutral subjects. The non-rival out-group acts as a reference point and allows us to measure in-group favouritism and out-group discrimination. A treatment with artificial groups serves as a control. We find both in-group favouritism and out-group discrimination among the naturally occurring groups. In artificial groups, favouritism is observed, but not discrimination. Our results suggest that the two behaviours are not driven by the same motive, and only when groups are in conflict that out-group discrimination is likely to occur."
https://openalex.org/W2971883101,"Currently used risk scores for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) clearly underestimate cardiovascular risk in type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Hence, there is a need to develop novel and specific risk-estimation tools for this population. We aimed to assess the relationship between the Steno Type 1 Risk Engine (ST1RE) and arterial stiffness (AS), and to identify potential cut-off points of interest in clinical practice.A total of 179 patients with T1DM (50.8% men, mean age 41.2±13.1 years), without established cardiovascular disease, were evaluated for clinical and anthropometric data (including classical cardiovascular risk factors), and AS measured by aortic pulse-wave velocity (aPWV). The ST1RE was used to estimate 10-year cardiovascular risk and patients were classified into 3 groups: low- (<10%; n = 105), moderate- (10-20%; n = 53) and high-risk (≥20%; n = 21).When compared with the low- and moderate-risk groups, patients in the high-risk group were older, had higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin-resistance, and had higher body-mass index and HbA1c. aPWV increased in parallel with estimated cardiovascular risk (6.4±1.0, 8.4±1.3 and 10.3±2.6m/s; p<0.001). As an evaluation of model performance, the C-statistic of aPWV was 0.914 (95% confidence interval [CI]:0.873-0.950) for predicting moderate/high-risk and 0.879 (95%CI:0.809-0.948) for high-risk, according to the ST1RE. The best cut-off points of aPWV were 7.3m/s (sensitivity:86%, specificity:83%) and 8.7m/s (sensitivity:76%, specificity:86%) for moderate/high- and high-risk, respectively.AS is highly correlated with the scores obtained from the ST1RE. We have identified two cut-off points of AS that can clearly discriminate moderate/high- and high-risk T1DM patients, which could be of great value in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2971940783,"Biochemical changes in utero may alter normal fetal development, resulting in disease later in life, a phenomenon known as fetal programming. Recent epidemiological studies link fetal programming to negative health outcomes, such as low birth weight and hypertension in adulthood. Here, we used a WKY rat model and studied the molecular changes triggered by prenatal glucocorticoid (GC) exposure on the development of hypertension, and on the regulation of phenylethanolamine N-methyl transferase (PNMT), the enzyme responsible for biosynthesis of epinephrine, and a candidate gene linked to hypertension. Clinically, high doses of the synthetic GC dexamethasone (DEX) are used to treat infant respiratory distress syndrome. Elevated maternal GCs have been correlated with fetal programming of hypertension. The aim of this study was to determine if lower doses of DEX would not lead to detrimental fetal programming effects such as hypertension. Our data suggests that prenatal stress programs for increased expression of PNMT and altered regulation of PNMT in males and females. Importantly, we identified that DEX mediated programming was more apparent in the male rats, and the lower dose 10μg/kg/day of DEX did not lead to changes in blood pressure (BP) in female rats suggesting that this dose is below the threshold for programming of hypertension. Furthermore, sex-specific differences were observed in regards to programming mechanisms that may account for hypertension in males."
https://openalex.org/W2972232274,"With green development becoming a global movement, environmental tax has been adopted by many governments to promote green development. This study analyzes the impact of environmental tax on green development by using a four-dimension dynamical system. The establishment of the system is based on the complex and dynamic interactions among economic development, pollution emissions, resources consumption, and environmental tax, where roles of environmental tax are reflected by the linear parameters. A theoretic analysis shows the complexity of the behavior of the system. Mainly, the existence of chaos is inferred by Lyapunov exponent spectrum and bifurcation diagram, then verified by the presence of a chaotic attractor. An empirical study of the green development dynamical system in China demonstrates the particular evolution paths of economic growth, pollution intensity, and resource intensity under different environmental tax parameters. Results indicate a robust beneficial role of environmental tax on green development. Furthermore, when an environmental tax is imposed, a firm government control, an active consumer awareness, an advanced technology level can stimulate economic growth, decrease pollution intensity, and control the resource intensity. But the government control has a stronger effect. This study provides a viable and promising approach to analyze the role of imposing an environmental tax on green development and may have potential application in other areas and countries."
https://openalex.org/W2971643958,"Our food security depends on finding a sustainable alternative to rock phosphate for fertilizer production. Furthermore, over 2 billion people worldwide are currently affected by micronutrient deficiencies, and crop concentrations of essential minerals are declining. This paper examines whether a novel multi-element fertilizer, Thallo®, can produce crop yields comparable to conventional rock phosphate derived fertilizers, and have an additional benefit of increasing essential mineral concentrations. Thallo®, produced from abattoir and recycled industrial by-products, was tested against conventional mineral fertilizers in a pot trial with wheat and grass. In soil, yields were comparable between the fertilizer types, but, in a low-nutrient substrate, Thallo® showed a yield benefit. Elemental concentrations in the plant material typically reflected the relative concentrations in the fertilizer, and Thallo® fertilized plants contained significantly more of some essential elements, such as selenium and zinc. Furthermore, concentrations of the toxic element cadmium were significantly lower in Thallo® fertilized crops. Among the fertilizers, manganese concentrations were greatest in the Thallo®, but within the fertilized plants, they were greatest under the mineral fertilizer, showing the complexity of assessing whether nutrients will be taken up by crops. In summary, fertilizers from livestock waste have the potential to improve wheat and grass concentrations of essential elements while maintaining yields."
https://openalex.org/W2972078576,"Findings of recent studies indicate that it is possible to enhance cognitive capacities of healthy individuals by means of individual upper alpha neurofeedback training (NFT). Although these results are promising, most of this research was conducted based on high-priced EEG systems developed for clinical and research purposes. This study addresses the question whether such effects can also be shown with an easy to use and comparably low-priced Emotiv Epoc EEG headset available for the average consumer. In addition, critical voices were raised regarding the control group designs of studies addressing the link between neurofeedback training and cognitive performance. Based on an extensive literature review revealing considerable methodological issues in an important part of the existing research, the present study addressed the question whether individual upper alpha neurofeedback has a positive effect on alpha amplitudes (i.e. increases alpha amplitudes) and short-term memory performance focussing on a methodologically sound, single-blinded, sham controlled design.Participants (N = 33) took part in four test sessions over four consecutive days of either neurofeedback training (NFT group) or sham feedback (SF group). In the NFT group, five three-minute periods of visual neurofeedback training were administered each day whereas in the SF group (control group), the same amount of sham feedback was presented. Performance on eight digit-span tests as well as participants' affective states were assessed before and after each of the daily training sessions.NFT did not show an effect on individual upper alpha and cognitive performance. While performance increased in both groups over the course of time, this effect could not be explained by changes in individual upper alpha. Additional analyses however revealed that participants in the NFT group showed faster and larger increase in alpha compared to the SF group. Surprisingly, exploratory analyses showed a significant correlation between the initial alpha level and the alpha improvement during the course of the study. This finding suggests that participants with high initial alpha levels benefit more from alpha NFT interventions. In the discussion, the appearance of the alpha enhancement in the SF group and possible reasons for the absence of a connection between NFT and short-term memory are addressed."
https://openalex.org/W2972166607,"Scientists across disciplines must often work together to address pressing global issues facing our societies. For interdisciplinary projects to flourish, scientists must recognise the potential contribution of other disciplines in answering key research questions. Recent research suggested that social sciences may be appreciated less than hard sciences overall. Building on the extensive evidence of ingroup bias and ethnocentrism in intergroup relations, however, one could also expect scientists, especially those belonging to high status disciplines, to play down the contributions of other disciplines to important research questions. The focus of the present research was to investigate how hard and social scientists perceive one another and the impact of interdisciplinary collaborations on these perceptions. We surveyed 280 scientists at Wave 1 and with 129 of them followed up at Wave 2 to establish how ongoing interdisciplinary collaborations underpinned perceptions of other disciplines. Based on Wave 1 data, scientists who report having interdisciplinary experiences more frequently are also more likely to recognise the intellectual contribution of other disciplines and perceive more commonalities with them. However, in line with the intergroup bias literature, group membership in the more prestigious hard sciences is related to a stronger tendency to downplay the intellectual contribution of social science disciplines compared to other hard science disciplines. This bias was not present among social scientists who produced very similar evaluation of contribution of hard and social science disciplines. Finally, using both waves of the survey, the social network comparison of discipline pairs shows that asymmetries in the evaluation of other disciplines are only present among discipline pairs that do not have any experience of collaborating with one another. These results point to the need for policies that incentivise new collaborations between hard and social scientists and foster interdisciplinary contact."
https://openalex.org/W2972292427,"Increased use of salting to de-ice roadways, especially in urban areas, is leading to elevated salinity levels in soil as well as surface- and ground water. This salt pollution may cause long-term ecological changes to soil and aquatic microbial communities. In this study, we examined the impact on microbial communities in soils exposed to urban road salt runoff using both culturing and 16S amplicon sequencing. Both methods showed an increase in halophilic Bacteria and Archaea in samples from road salt-exposed areas and suggested that halophiles are becoming persistent members of microbial communities in urban, road salt-impacted soils. Since salt is a pollutant that can accumulate in soils over time, it is critical to begin assessing its impact on the environment immediately. Toward this goal, we have developed a facile semi-quantitative assay utilizing halophilic microbes as biomarkers to evaluate on-going salt pollution of soils."
https://openalex.org/W2971005275,"Cord blood (CB) mononuclear cells (MNC) are being tested in clinical trials to treat hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injuries. Although early results are encouraging, mechanisms underlying potential clinical benefits are not well understood. To explore these mechanisms further, we exposed mouse brain organotypic slice cultures to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and then treated the brain slices with cells from CB or adult peripheral blood (PB). We found that CB-MNCs protect neurons from OGD-induced death and reduced both microglial and astrocyte activation. PB-MNC failed to affect either outcome. The protective activities were largely mediated by factors secreted by CB-MNC, as direct cell-to-cell contact between the injured brain slices and CB cells was not essential. To determine if a specific subpopulation of CB-MNC are responsible for these protective activities, we depleted CB-MNC of various cell types and found that only removal of CB CD14+ monocytes abolished neuroprotection. We also used positively selected subpopulations of CB-MNC and PB-MNC in this assay and demonstrated that purified CB-CD14+ cells, but not CB-PB CD14+ cells, efficiently protected neuronal cells from death and reduced glial activation following OGD. Gene expression microarray analysis demonstrated that compared to PB-CD14+ monocytes, CB-CD14+ monocytes over-expressed several secreted proteins with potential to protect neurons. Differential expression of five candidate effector molecules, chitinase 3-like protein-1, inhibin-A, interleukin-10, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and thrombospondin-1, were confirmed by western blotting, and immunofluorescence. These findings suggest that CD14+ monocytes are a critical cell-type when treating HI with CB-MNC."

Although the efficacy of this therapy has been seen in the clinic, the mechanisms by which UCB cells interact and aid in the improvement of symptoms are not clear. We explored the chemokine expression profile in damaged brain tissue in the neonatal mouse ischemia-reperfusion (IR) brain injury model that was infused with human UCB (hUCB) cells. IR brain injury was induced in 9-day-old NOD/SCID mice. hUCB cells were administered 3 weeks post brain injury. Chemokine expression profiles in the brain extract were determined at various time points. Inflammatory chemokines such as CCL1, CCL17, and CXCL12 were transiently upregulated by 24 hours post brain injury. Upregulation of other chemokines, including CCL5, CCL9, and CXCL1 were prolonged up to 3 weeks post brain injury, but most chemokines dissipated over time. There were marked increases in levels of CCL2, CCL12, CCL20, and CX3CL1 in response to hUCB cell treatment, which might be related to the new recruitment and differentiation of neural stem cells, leading to the induction of tissue regeneration. We propose that the chemokine expression profile in the brain shifted from responding to tissue damage to inducing tissue regeneration. hUCB cell administration further enhanced the production of chemokines, and chemokine networks may play an active role in tissue regeneration in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury."
https://openalex.org/W2971719869,"Past research on the process of extinguishing a fire typically used a traditional linear water jet falling point model and the results ignored external factors, such as environmental conditions and the status of the fire engine, even though the water jet falling point location prediction was often associated with these parameters and showed a nonlinear relationship. This paper constructed a BP (Back Propagation) neural network model. The fire gun nozzle characteristics were included as model inputs, and the water discharge point coordinates were the model outputs; thus, the model could precisely predict the water discharge point with small error and high precision to determine an accurate firing position and allow for the timely adjustment of the spray gun. To improve the slow convergence and local optimality problems of the BP neural network (BPNN), this paper further used a genetic algorithm to optimize the BPNN (GA-BPNN). The BPNN can be used to optimize the weights in the network to train them for global optimization. A genetic algorithm was introduced into the neural network approach, and the water jet landing prediction model was further improved. The simulation results showed that the prediction accuracy of the GA-BP model was better than that of the BPNN alone. The established model can accurately predict the location of the water jet, making the prediction results more useful for firefighters."

Based on the magnitude of tide, intensity of shipping and boating activities, the stretch from Baranagar to Lalbag (278 km), located at latitude (22°38'33.41""N to 24°10'59.75""N) and longitude (88°21'21.29""E to 88°16'5.65""E) was divided into three zones viz. zone-I (Baranagar to Barrackpore), zone II (Triveni to Balagarh) and zone III (Nabadweep to Lalbag). Water samples were collected randomly from six stations covering 22 barge movements at their passage at three different time intervals viz., 30 minutes before 'barge movement', during 'barge movement' and 30 minutes after 'barge movement'. Analysis revealed the presence of 52 phytoplankton taxa belonged to 5 phylum during the study period. The abundance of phytoplankton was highest in zone-I followed by zone III and the zone II. A 44% decrease (1,997 ±1,510 ul-1) in phytoplankton abundance was observed during 'barge movement' with respect to normal condition (3,513 ± 2,239 ul-1) which could be due to propeller turbulence in the passage. Cell damage study revealed 21% damage in phytoplankton cell structure in 'during barge' followed by 'after barge' (10%) condition compared to natural state (6%). Study revealed that phytoplankton biomass (Chlorophyll a) was influenced by 'barge movement' in the sampling stretches and the impact was assessed by one way ANOVA. The effect was found significant at Barrackpore (p <0.01), Triveni (p <0.01), Balagarh (p <0.01) and Lalbag (p <0.01) where as it was insignificant at Baranagar and Nabadweep, which may be due to continuous and existing boat trafficking at Baranagar and Nabadweep. Two way ANOVA computed using 'barge movement' and sampling stations showed significant (p<0.01) effect on magnitude of Chl a concentrations in the sampling locations. Thus, the 'barge movement' influenced phytoplankton abundance and biomass, it had a detrimental effect on phytoplankton cell architecture also. The data set of this work serves as foundation information to understand the ecological implications augmented barge induced environmental disturbances in waterways. This is the first such study which depicts the impact of 'barge movement' on aquatic food chain linkages in Bhagirathi- Hooghly river."
https://openalex.org/W2971427407,"Multiple cross-sectional studies have shown that regular complex exercises, which require cognitive demands (e.g., decision making) and various motions, are associated with greater positive effects on executive functions compared to simple exercises. However, the evidence of a single bout of complex exercises is mixed, and investigations on the acute effect of complex exercise using a well-controlled within-subjects research design are few. Therefore, we compared the acute effects of complex exercise on inhibitory functions with those of simple running. Twenty young adults performed three interventions, which were running, badminton, and seated rest as a control condition for 10 min each. During each intervention, oxygen consumption and heart rate were monitored. A Stroop test and a reverse-Stroop test were completed before and after each intervention. The intensities of the badminton and running were equivalent. Badminton significantly improved performance on the Stroop task compared to seated rest; however, running did not enhance performance on the Stroop task relative to seated rest. A single bout of complex exercise elicits a larger benefit to inhibitory function than a single bout of simple exercise. However, the benefit of complex exercise may vary depending on the type of executive functions."
https://openalex.org/W2971474046,"Background In Bangladesh, community-based and peer-led prevention interventions for human immunodeficiency virus infection are provided to key populations (KPs) by drop-in centers (DICs), which are primarily supported by external donors. This intervention approach was adopted because public healthcare facilities were reportedly insensitive to the needs and culture of KPs, particularly with regard to the provision of sexually transmitted infection (STI) services. Nonetheless, in the absence of external funding, STI services need to be integrated into public healthcare systems. Methods A qualitative study was conducted in 2017 to understand the willingness of KPs to uptake the STI services of public healthcare facilities. Data were collected based on 34 in-depth interviews, 11 focus group discussions, and 9 key informant interviews. The social-ecological theoretical framework was used to analyze the data thematically and contextually. Results Most participants were either resistant or reluctant to uptake STI services from public healthcare facilities because of their previous firsthand experiences (e.g., disrespectful and judgmental attitudes and behaviors), perceived discrimination, anticipatory fear, and a lack of privacy. Very few participants who had visited these facilities to receive STI services were motivated to revisit them. Nevertheless, they emphasized their comfort in DICs over public healthcare facilities. Thus, it appears that KPs can be situated along a care-seeking continuum (i.e., resistance to complete willingness). Unless policymakers understand the context and reasons that underlie their movement along this continuum, it would be difficult to encourage KPs to access STI services from public healthcare facilities. Conclusion KPs’ willingness to uptake the STI services of public healthcare facilities depends not only on individual and community experiences but also on the nexus between socio-structural factors and health inequalities. Community mobilization and training about the needs and culture of KPs for healthcare professionals are essential. Therefore, addressal of a wide range of structural factors is required to motivate KPs into seeking STI services from public healthcare facilities."
https://openalex.org/W2971909548,"Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is one of the major threats to human health globally. Despite huge efforts in malaria control and eradication, highly effective vaccines are urgently needed, including vaccines that can block malaria transmission. Chimeric virus-like particles (VLP) have emerged as a promising strategy to develop new malaria vaccine candidates.We developed yeast cell lines and processes for the expression of malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidates Pfs25 and Pfs230 as VLP and VLP were analyzed for purity, size, protein incorporation rate and expression of malaria antigens.In this study, a novel platform for the display of Plasmodium falciparum antigens on chimeric VLP is presented. Leading transmission-blocking vaccine candidates Pfs25 and Pfs230 were genetically fused to the small surface protein (dS) of the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV). The resulting fusion proteins were co-expressed in recombinant Hansenula polymorpha (syn. Pichia angusta, Ogataea polymorpha) strains along with the wild-type dS as the VLP scaffold protein. Through this strategy, chimeric VLP containing Pfs25 or the Pfs230-derived fragments Pfs230c or Pfs230D1M were purified. Up to 100 mg chimeric VLP were isolated from 100 g dry cell weight with a maximum protein purity of 90% on the protein level. Expression of the Pfs230D1M construct was more efficient than Pfs230c and enabled VLP with higher purity. VLP showed reactivity with transmission-blocking antibodies and supported the surface display of the malaria antigens on the native VLP.The incorporation of leading Plasmodium falciparum transmission-blocking antigens into the dS-based VLP scaffold is a promising novel strategy for their display on nano-scaled particles. Competitive processes for efficient production and purification were established in this study."

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided drainage has replaced surgery as the standard treatment for PC/WON. We developed a novel lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) with an anti-reflux valve to prevent infectious complications caused by food reflux into the cyst cavity. This retrospective study investigated the efficacy and safety of EUS-guided drainage using this LAMS.We investigated and compared the treatment outcomes and complications rates between EUS-guided drainage using a novel LAMS (n = 10) versus plastic stents (n = 18) from December 2013 to October 2016. Technical success was defined as successful stent placement without immediate complications. Clinical success was defined as resolution of the PC/WON and disappearance of symptoms.Among 10 patients in LAMS group, 4 patients had complicated PC and 6 patients had WON. In the plastic stent group, 15 and 3 patients had PC and WON, respectively. The median fluid collection size before treatment was 82.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 60.75-118.25) mm and 92.0 (IQR, 75.75-130.25) mm in the LAMS and plastic stent groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in technical success rates (90% vs. 94.4%; p = 0.999), clinical success rates (80% vs. 77.8%; p = 0.999), and complication rates (20% vs. 27.8%; p = 0.999) between the two groups.Treatment outcomes of EUS-guided drainage using a novel LAMS were feasible despite the significantly high proportion of WON. The LAMS allowed acceptable treatment outcomes for EUS-guided drainage."

True burden of tuberculosis (TB) in children is unknown. Hospitalised children are low-hanging fruit for TB case detection as they are within the system. We aimed to explore the process of recognition and investigation for childhood TB using a guideline-linked cascade of care.


Methods 
This was an observational study of 42,107 children admitted to 13 county hospitals in Kenya from 01Nov 15-31Oct 16, and 01Nov 17-31Oct 18. We estimated those that met each step of the cascade, those with an apparent (or “Working”) TB diagnosis and modelled associations with TB tests amongst guideline-eligible children.


Results 
23,741/42,107 (56.4%) met step 1 of the cascade (≥2 signs and symptoms suggestive of TB). Step 2(further screening of history of TB contact/full respiratory exam) was documented in 14,873/23,741 (62.6%) who met Step 1. Step 3(chest x-ray or Mantoux test) was requested in 2,451/14,873 (16.5%) who met Step 2. Step 4(≥1 bacteriological test) was requested in 392/2,451 (15.9%) who met Step 3. Step 5(“Working TB” diagnosis) was documented in 175/392 (44.6%) who met Step 4. Factors associated with request of TB tests in patients who met Step 1 included: i) older children [AOR 1.19(CI 1.09–1.31)]; ii) co-morbidities of HIV, malnutrition or pneumonia [AOR 3.81(CI 3.05–4.75), 2.98(CI 2.69–3.31) and 2.98(CI 2.60–3.40) respectively]; iii) sicker children, readmitted/referred [AOR 1.24(CI 1.08–1.42) and 1.15(CI 1.04–1.28) respectively]. “Working TB” diagnosis was made in 2.9%(1,202/42,107) of all admissions and 0.2%(89/42,107) were bacteriologically-confirmed.


Conclusions 
More than half of all paediatric admissions had symptoms associated with TB and nearly two-thirds had more specific history documented. Only a few amongst them got TB tests requested. TB was diagnosed in 2.9% of all admissions but most were inadequately investigated. Major challenges remain in identifying and investigating TB in children in hospitals with access to Xpert MTB/RIF and a review is needed of existing guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2971871137,"To determine the impact of body weight on quiet standing postural sway characteristics in young women, this research compared spontaneous oscillations of the center of foot pressure (COP) between 32 obese (BMI: 36.4 ± 5.2 kg/m2), and 26 normal-weight (BMI: 21.4 ± 1.5 kg/m2) women and assessed the influence of obesity treatment and body weight reduction on postural sway. Trajectories of the COP were assessed while the subjects were standing quietly with eyes open (EO) and closed (EC). Both in the sagittal (AP) and frontal (ML) planes the sway range, average velocity, and maximal velocity of COP were calculated. Moreover, the total average and maximal velocities were computed. In the obese group, the tests were performed twice-before and after the obesity treatment. A greater (18% in EC) AP sway range and a substantial reduction of ML sway (25% in EO, 22% in EC) were observed in the obese women. The total COP velocities (average and maximal) were decreased in obese women (20% and 20% in EO) as well as the velocities in the frontal plane (EO: 33%, 41%; EC: 34%, 40%). Body weight reduction resulted in significant changes in postural sway. The following parameters increased: ML sway range (28% in EO), average (20% in EO, 16% in EC) and maximal ML (20% in EO) velocities. The results indicate that young obese women in the habitual standing position are characterized by the destabilizing influence of mass in the sagittal plane only in the absence of a visual control. This effect is dominated by the stabilizing mass effect in the frontal plane, which affects overall postural stability when standing. The reduction of body mass enables a decrease in ML static stability, likely due to natural changes in the base of support while standing."
https://openalex.org/W2971884759,"We investigated the feasibility of using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique using molecular barcoding technology to detect MYD88 L265P mutation in unselected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 52 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia [1] and 21 patients with IgM-monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The NGS technique successfully detected the MYD88 L265P in unselected PBMCs at a sensitivity of 0.02%, which was ×5 higher than that of AS-PCR. All the results between paired BM and PB samples from 2 IgM MGUS and 4 untreated WM patients matched completely. MYD88 L265P mutation was detected in 14/21 (66.7%), 14/19 (73.7%), and 10/33 (30.3%) with the median mutant allele burden of 0.36% (range, 0.06-2.85%), 0.48% (range, 0.02-32.3%), and 0.16% (range, 0.02-33.8%), in IgM-MGUS, untreated WM, and previously treated WM, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis identified an absolute peripheral lymphocyte count as the positive predictor of PB mutant allele burden (R2 = 0,72, P<0.0001). Our non-invasive, simple NGS method has the potential to detect MYD88 L265P mutations in PBMCs of IgM MGUS and WM patients, which may especially utilized for monitoring minimal residual tumor burden after treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2972087907,"Side effects caused by radiation are a limiting factor to the amount of dose that can be applied to a tumor volume. A novel method to reduce side effects in radiotherapy is the use of spatial fractionation, in which a pattern of sub-millimeter beams (minibeams) is applied to spare healthy tissue. In order to determine the skin reactions in dependence of single beam sizes, which are relevant for spatially fractionated radiotherapy approaches, single pencil beams of submillimeter to 6 millimeter size were applied in BALB/c mice ears at a Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP) with a plateau dose of 60 Gy. Radiation toxicities in the ears were observed for 25 days after irradiation. Severe radiation responses were found for beams ≥ 3 mm diameter. The larger the beam diameter the stronger the observed reactions. No ear swelling and barely reddening or desquamation were found for the smallest beam sizes (0.5 and 1 mm). The findings were confirmed by histological sections. Submillimeter beams are preferred in minibeam therapy to obtain optimized tissue sparing. The gradual increase of radiation toxicity with beam size shows that also larger beams are capable of healthy tissue sparing in spatial fractionation."
https://openalex.org/W2971969490,"Climate change is now considered a significant threat to terrestrial biodiversity. Species distribution models (SDMs) are among the modern tools currently used to assess the potential impacts of climate change on species. Pipiza Fallén, 1810 is a well known aphidophagous hoverfly genus (Diptera, Syrphidae) at the European level, for which sampling has been conducted across the region, and long-term databases and geo-referenced datasets have been established. Therefore, in this work, we investigated the potential current distributions of the European species of this genus and their response to future climate change scenarios, as well as evaluated stability in their ranges and potential changes in species-richness patterns. We applied three climate models (BCC_CSM1.1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-ES) to four representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, RCP 8.5) for two time frames (2050 and 2070). Our results show that the distribution of most Pipiza species may slightly differ under different climate models. Most Pipiza species were predicted not to be greatly affected by climate change, maintaining their current extent. Percentages of stable areas will remain high (above 50%) for the majority of studied species. According to the predicted turnover of species, northern Europe, could become the richest in terms of species diversity, thus replacing Central Europe as the current hot spot."

https://openalex.org/W2971450710,"We investigate the effectiveness of network attack strategies when the attacker has only imperfect information about the network. While most existing network attack strategies assume complete knowledge about the network, in reality it is difficult to obtain the complete structure of a large-scale complex network. This paper considers two scenarios in which the available network information is imperfect. In one scenario, the network contains link errors (i.e., missing and false links) due to measurement errors, and in the other scenario the target network is so large that only part of the network structure is available from network sampling. Through extensive simulations, we show that particularly in a network with highly skewed degree distribution, network attack strategies are robust against link errors. Even if the network contains 30% false links and missing links, the strategies are just as effective as when the complete network is available. We also show that the attack strategies are far less effective when the network is obtained from random sampling, whereas the detrimental effects of network sampling on network attack strategies are small when using biased sampling strategies such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, and sample edge counts. Moreover, the effectiveness of network attack strategies is examined in the context of network immunization, and the implications of the results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2971591652,"The aim of this paper is to test the hypothesis that healed traumatic injuries in the pre-Neolithic assemblage of Con Co Ngua, northern Vietnam (c. 6800–6200 cal BP) are consistent with large wild animal interactions prior to their domestication. The core sample included 110 adult (aged ≥ 18 years) individuals, while comparisons are made with an additional six skeletal series from Neolithic through to Iron Age Vietnam, Thailand, and Mongolia. All post cranial skeletal elements were assessed for signs of healed trauma and identified cases were further x-rayed. Crude trauma prevalence (14/110, 12.7%) was not significantly different between males (8/52) and females (5/37) (χ2 = 0.061, p = 0.805). Nor were there significant differences in the prevalence of fractured limbs, although males displayed greater rates of lower limb bone trauma than females. Further, distinct from females, half the injured males suffered vertebral fractures, consistent with high-energy trauma. The first hypothesis is supported, while some support for the sexual divisions of labour was found. The prevalence and pattern of fractured limbs at CCN when compared with other Southeast and East Asian sites is most similar to the agropastoral site of Lamadong, China. The potential for skeletal trauma to assess animal trapping and herding practices prior to domestication in the past is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2971763104,"Aim The study aimed to establish how granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Materials and methods Study A: samples of blood and tracheal aspirates (TAs) collected from preterm newborn infants during the first 3 days of life were investigated by flow cytometry, and testing for white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Maternal blood samples were also collected. Study B: data from previously-tested samples of TAs collected from preterm newborn infants were re-analyzed in the light of the findings in the new cohort. Results Study A: 39 preterm newborn infants were studied. A moderate correlation emerged between maternal WBCs and neutrophils and those of their newborn in the first 3 days of life. WBCs and neutrophils correlated in the newborn during the first 8 days of life. Decision rules based on birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) can be used to predict bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Neutrophil levels were lower in the TAs from the newborn with the lowest GAs and BWs. Study B: after removing the effect of GA on BPD development, previously-tested newborn were matched by GA. Monocyte phenotype 1 (Mon1) levels were lower in the blood of newborn with BPD, associated with a higher ratio of Monocyte phenotype 3 (Mon3) to Mon1. Newborn infants from mothers with histological chorioamnionitis (HCA) had lower levels of classically-activated macrophages (M1) and higher levels of alternatively-activated macrophages (M2) in their TAs than newborn infants from healthy mothers. Conclusion Immune cell behavior in preterm newborn infants was examined in detail. Surprisingly, neutrophil levels were lower in TAs from the newborn with the lowest GA and BW, and no correlation emerged between the neutrophil and NET levels in TAs and the other variables measured. Interestingly, monocyte phenotype seemed to influence the onset of BPD. The rise in the ratio of Mon 3 to Mon 1 could contribute to endothelial dysfunction in BPD."
https://openalex.org/W2972109495,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is an important member of the CDK family exerting its most important function in the regulation of the cell cycle. It catalyzes the transfer of the gamma phosphate group from an ATP (adenosine triphosphate) molecule to a Serine/Threonine residue of a peptide substrate. Due to the importance of this enzyme, and protein kinases in general, a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism is desired. Thus, in this work the phosphoryl transfer reaction catalyzed by CDK2 was revisited and studied by means of hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. Our results suggest that the base-assisted mechanism is preferred over the substrate-assisted pathway when one Mg2+ is present in the active site, in agreement with a previous theoretical study. The base-assisted mechanism resulted to be dissociative, with a potential energy barrier of 14.3 kcal/mol, very close to the experimental derived value. An interesting feature of the mechanism is the proton transfer from Lys129 to the phosphoryl group at the second transition state, event that could be helping in neutralizing the charge on the phosphoryl group upon the absence of a second Mg2+ ion. Furthermore, important insights into the mechanisms in terms of bond order and charge analysis were provided. These descriptors helped to characterize the synchronicity of bond forming and breaking events, and to characterize charge transfer effects. Local interactions at the active site are key to modulate the charge distribution on the phosphoryl group and therefore alter its reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2971655127,"Background Severe centrum semiovale perivascular spaces (CSO-PVSs) are associated with the onset of brain atrophy and dementia. This study explored the relationship between severity of CSO-PVS and development of subdural fluid (SDF) in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), with the aim of investigating independent radiological risk factors for development of SDF. Methods The study cohort comprised 222 patients with a mean age of 51 years (64.0% men) who presented with mild TBI from January 2013 to November 2016. In this study, mild TBI was defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of ≥ 13, Post-Traumatic Amnesia (PTA) of <1 day, and Loss of Consciousness (LOC) of <30 minutes. The severity of CSO-PVS was categorized as low or high-degree. Results Among the 222 enrolled patients, 38 (17.1%) and 90 (40.5%) had high-degree PVS in the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale, respectively. Compared with patients who did not develop SDF, the mean age of patients who developed SDF was significantly higher (47.41 years versus 60.33 years, P < 0.0001). The incidence of de novo SDF was significantly higher in men than in women (77.8% versus 59.5%, P = 0.0151). Patients who showed SDF on brain computed tomography at admission more frequently developed de novo SDF (68.5% versus 38.1%, P < 0.0001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis of risk factors, high-degree CSO-PVS, male sex, initial SDF on admission, and old age were independently associated with development of de novo SDF after mild TBI. In Cox proportional hazards models of risk factors for SDF-development free survival rate, high-degree CSO-PVS, old age, and initial subdural hemorrhage showed statistically significant differences. Conclusions Our study might help neurosurgeons determine the frequency of brain CT or the duration of follow-up for patients who present with mild TBI with high-degree CSO-PVS."
https://openalex.org/W2971737037,"Needles with diameter under 1 mm are used in various medical applications to limit the risk of complication and patient discomfort during the procedure. Next to a small diameter, needle steerability is an important property for reaching targets located deep inside the body accurately and precisely. In this paper, we present a 0.5-mm prototype probe which is able to steer in three dimensions (3D) without the need of axial rotation. The prototype consists of three Nitinol wires (each with a diameter of 0.125 mm) with a pre-curved tip. The wires are kept together by a stainless steel tube. Each wire is clamped to a block which translates along a leadscrew, the rotation of the latter being controlled by a wheel connected at the distal end of the leadscrew. The tip bends upon retraction of one or two wires. When pushed through a soft solid structure (e.g., a soft tissue or soft tissue phantom), the probe deflects due to off-axis forces acting on its tip by the surrounding structure. We tested the performance of the prototype into a 10% wt gelatine phantom, in terms of the predictability of the steering direction and the controllability of the final position after steering inside the substrate. The results showed that the probe steered in the direction of the retracted wire and that the final position varied from small deflections from the straight path when the wires were slightly retracted, to sharp curvatures for large wire retraction. The probe could be used in various applications, from cases where only a small correction of the path in one direction is needed to cases where the path to be followed includes obstacles and curves in multiple directions."

Molecular interrogation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can provide an attractive alternative for real-time biomarker assessment. However, implementation of CellSearch-based HER-2 analysis has been limited. Immunofluorescent (IF) image interpretation is crucial, as different HER-2 categories have been described. Major questions in CTC research are how these IF categories reflect gene expression and amplification, and if we should consider 'medium' HER-2 expressing CTCs for patient selection.Tumor cells from spiked cell lines (n = 8) and CTCs (n = 116 samples) of 85 metastatic breast cancer patients were enriched using CellSearch. Comparative analysis of HER-2 expression by IF imaging (ACCEPT, DEPArray, and visual scoring) with qRT-PCR and HER-2/neu FISH was performed.Automated IF HER-2-profiling by DEPArray and ACCEPT delivered comparable results. There was a 98% agreement between 17 trained observers (visual scoring) and ACCEPT considering HER-2neg and HER-2high expressing CTCs. However, 89% of HER-2med expressing CTCs by ACCEPT were scored negative by observers. HER-2high expressing tumor cells demonstrated HER-2/neu gene amplification, whereas HER-2neg and HER-2med expressing tumor cells and CTCs by ACCEPT were copy-number neutral. All patients with HER-2-positive archival tumors had ≥1 HER-2high expressing CTCs, while 80% of HER-2-negative patients did not. High relative gene expression of HER-2 measured on enriched CTC lysates correlated with having ≥1 HER-2high expressing CTCs.Automated images analysis has enormous potential for clinical implementation. HER-2 characterization and clinical trial design should be focused on HER-2high expressing CTCs."
https://openalex.org/W2971573519,"Lately, discourse structure has received considerable attention due to the benefits its application offers in several NLP tasks such as opinion mining, summarization, question answering, text simplification, among others. When automatically analyzing texts, discourse parsers typically perform two different tasks: i) identification of basic discourse units (text segmentation) ii) linking discourse units by means of discourse relations, building structures such as trees or graphs. The resulting discourse structures are, in general terms, accurate at intra-sentence discourse-level relations, however they fail to capture the correct inter-sentence relations. Detecting the main discourse unit (the Central Unit) is helpful for discourse analyzers (and also for manual annotation) in improving their results in rhetorical labeling. Bearing this in mind, we set out to build the first two steps of a discourse parser following a top-down strategy: i) to find discourse units, ii) to detect the Central Unit. The final step, i.e. assigning rhetorical relations, remains to be worked on in the immediate future. In accordance with this strategy, our paper presents a tool consisting of a discourse segmenter and an automatic Central Unit detector."

https://openalex.org/W2971730447,"Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) is endemic to the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) of Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP) and Kruger National Park, South Africa. In HiP, the disease has been actively managed since 1999 through a test-and-cull procedure targeting BTB-positive buffalo. Prior studies in Kruger showed associations between microsatellite alleles, BTB and body condition. A sex chromosomal meiotic drive, a form of natural gene drive, was hypothesized to be ultimately responsible. These associations indicate high-frequency occurrence of two types of male-deleterious alleles (or multiple-allele haplotypes). One type negatively affects body condition and BTB resistance in both sexes. The other type has sexually antagonistic effects: negative in males but positive in females. Here, we investigate whether a similar gene drive system is present in HiP buffalo, using 17 autosomal microsatellites and microsatellite-derived Y-chromosomal haplotypes from 401 individuals, culled in 2002-2004. We show that the association between autosomal microsatellite alleles and BTB susceptibility detected in Kruger, is also present in HiP. Further, Y-haplotype frequency dynamics indicated that a sex chromosomal meiotic drive also occurred in HiP. BTB was associated with negative selection of male-deleterious alleles in HiP, unlike positive selection in Kruger. Birth sex ratios were female-biased. We attribute negative selection and female-biased sex ratios in HiP to the absence of a Y-chromosomal sex-ratio distorter. This distorter has been hypothesized to contribute to positive selection of male-deleterious alleles and male-biased birth sex ratios in Kruger. As previously shown in Kruger, microsatellite alleles were only associated with male-deleterious effects in individuals born after wet pre-birth years; a phenomenon attributed to epigenetic modification. We identified two additional allele types: male-specific deleterious and beneficial alleles, with no discernible effect on females. Finally, we discuss how our findings may be used for breeding disease-free buffalo and implementing BTB test-and-cull programs."
https://openalex.org/W2971963374,"This study reevaluates the tooth morphology used to define species within the genus Edestus (Chondrichthyes, Euchondrocephali). Known as the scissor tooth shark, Edestus produced a unique dentition of spiraled tooth families positioned in the symphysis (midline) of the upper and lower jaws. Morphometric analysis of more than 200 ejected teeth and intact spiral tooth whorls demonstrates that teeth from the upper and lower whorls differ in shape and ontogeny. Comparison of these data to the type specimens of 13 existing species reduces the number of morphologically distinct Edestus to just four species and refines the stratigraphic occurrence and expansion of the group. E. triserratus has a narrow bullet-shaped crown that points anteriorly and has roots of intermediate length. E. minor crowns have a wider triangular base, whereas the crowns of E. heinrichi form nearly equilateral triangles and are supported by an elongated root. E. vorax, which also has roughly equilateral triangular crowns, has short and deep roots, and is only known from very large specimens that are distinct from the growth series of E. heinrichi. Tooth and whorl morphologies among the species are consistent with cranial anatomy observed in a juvenile E. heinrichi and with transverse tooth-wear patterns to suggest Edestus used a forward to backward slicing motion to bite its prey. Extrapolating body size from tooth whorl length provides a conservative estimate that E. heinrichi could exceed 6.7 m in length. Edestus fossils are recovered from coastal marine to estuarine deposits spanning roughly six million years (313-307 Ma). Edestus first appears in England during the latest Bashkirian (313 Ma, Carboniferous), a few million years after its most closely resembling genus Lestrodus. Diversification and range expansion of Edestus coincides with the Moscovian transgression that flooded Laurentia and the Russian platform."
https://openalex.org/W2972044504,"Despite the advances in canine medicine and the rapid gaining of attention of canine models in biomedical field and particularly in hemoglobin genes research, the studies on canine hemoglobin composition are sparse with ambiguous findings. Our aim was: i) to investigate the electrophoretic pattern of canine hemoglobin and the possible effects of age, sex, and anemia using a capillary electrophoresis assay, and ii) to validate this assay and calculate reference intervals (RIs) for canine hemoglobin fractions. Blood samples were collected from 53 healthy and 42 dogs with regenerative and non-regenerative anemias. The Sebia Capillarys 2 flex-piercing was used for hemoglobin analysis and it was validated using canine blood samples. R statistical language was employed for the statistical analyses. A major hemoglobin fraction (named HbA0) and a minor one (named HbA2) were identified in 100% and 47.4% of samples, respectively. The within-run and between-run CV was 0.1% for HbA0, and 9.1% and 11.2% for HbA2, respectively. The extremely narrow range of HbA0 and HbA2 values hampered a linearity study using canine blood samples. The RIs for HbA0 and HbA2 were 98.9-100% and 0-1.1%, respectively. HbA0 and HbA2 values were not significantly correlated with age (P = 0.866) or reticulocyte count (P = 0.731). No differences were observed in the median HbA0 and HbA2 between the two sexes (P = 0.887), and healthy and anemic dogs (P = 0.805). In conclusion, the capillary electrophoresis revealed a major hemoglobin fraction and an inconsistently present minor fraction. No effect of age, sex, anemia, or regenerative status of anemia was detected. The assay used was validated and RIs were generated, so as to be suitable for use in future investigations."

https://openalex.org/W2972069276,"This study aimed to understand the movement behaviour and utilization distributions of Kori bustards in space and time in the Serengeti ecosystem. A total of 14 individuals were tracked with the aid of GPS (Geographical positioning system) satellite transmitters, and their sexes were identified using DNA analysis. A species utilization distribution was estimated using the Brownian bridge movement model (hereafter dBBMM) in which the probability of being in an area is conditioned by starting and ending (GPS) relocations. Resource selections were analysed by comparing the GPS relocations with locations randomly placed within each individual's region of utilization in a spatio-temporal approach. Vegetation information was derived from a Serengeti GIS vegetation map and Data Centre and was reclassified as Open grassland, Dense grassland, Shrubbed grassland, Treed grassland, Shrubland, and Woodland. The Shannon diversity index for vegetation was calculated based on the original vegetation classification. Used versus non-used habitats were contrasted using a generalized linear mixed-effects model with a binomial distribution. The results indicated that males were 21.5% more mobile than females, and movements were 6.3% more diffuse during the non-breeding period compared to the breeding period (7.59 versus 7.14, respectively). Contrasting models indicated that males preferred more open grasslands during the non-breeding period and also preferred closed and shrubbed grassland during the breeding period. Females preferred more woody vegetation during the non-breeding season compared to the breeding season. The most parsimonious model indicated that females preferred to stay closer to rivers and diverse areas during the non-breeding period whereas males preferred areas that were farther from rivers and homogenous. Homogeneous areas were preferred during the breeding period, and heterogeneous areas were preferred during the non-breeding period. We conclude that the movement behaviours of Kori bustards changes with the season and habitat. Further research is needed to understand the factors driving the seasonal movement of Kori bustards in the Serengeti ecosystem."
