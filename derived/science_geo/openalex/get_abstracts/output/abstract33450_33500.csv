https://openalex.org/W1993210315,"Quiescent T cells can be induced to express many genes by mitogen or antigen stimulation. The messenger RNAs of some of these genes undergo relatively rapid degradation compared to messenger RNAs from constitutively expressed genes. A T cell activation pathway that specifically regulates the stability of messenger RNAs for the lymphokines interleukin-2, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is induced by stimulation of the CD28 surface molecule. This pathway does not directly affect the steady-state messenger RNA level, transcription, or messenger RNA half-life of other T cell activation genes, including c-myc, c-fos, IL-2 receptor, and the 4F2HC surface antigen. These data show that stimuli received at the cell surface can alter gene expression by inducing specific changes in messenger RNA degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2028272667,"Murine type C ecotropic retrovirus infection is initiated by virus envelope binding to a membrane receptor expressed on mouse cells. We have identified a cDNA clone that may encode for this receptor through a strategy combining gene transfer of mouse NIH 3T3 DNA into nonpermissive human EJ cells, selection of EJ clones that have acquired susceptibility to infection by retrovirus vectors containing drug resistance genes, and identification of the putative receptor cDNA clone through linkage to a mouse repetitive DNA sequence. Human EJ cells that express the cDNA acquire a million-fold increase in MuLV infectivity. The predicted 622 amino acid sequence of the putative receptor protein is extremely hydrophobic; 14 potential membrane-spanning domains have been identified. A computer-based search of sequence data banks did not identify a protein with significant similarity to the putative receptor. We conclude that a novel membrane protein determines susceptibility to ecotropic MuLV infection by binding and/or fusion with the virus envelope."
https://openalex.org/W1925289812,"Abstract We report that a cysteine residue in the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) is covalently modified by thioesterification with palmitic acid. By site-directed mutagenesis of the receptor, we have identified Cys341 in the carboxyl tail of the protein as the most likely site of palmitoylation. Mutation of Cys341 to glycine results in a nonpalmitoylated form of the receptor that exhibits a drastically reduced ability to mediate isoproterenol stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. The functional impairment of this mutated beta 2AR is also reflected in a markedly reduced ability to form a guanyl nucleotide-sensitive high affinity state for agonists, characteristic of wild-type receptor. These results indicate that post-translational modification by palmitate of beta 2AR may play a crucial role in the normal coupling of the receptor to the adenylyl cyclase signal transduction system."
https://openalex.org/W1654237604,"Receptors that mediate their actions by stimulating guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) share structural as well as functional similarities. The structural motif characteristic of receptors of this class includes seven hydrophobic putative transmembrane domains linked by hydrophilic loops. Genetic analysis of the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) revealed that the ligand binding domain of this receptor, like that of rhodopsin, involves residues within the hydrophobic core of the protein. On the basis of these studies, a model for ligand binding to the receptor has been developed in which the amino group of an agonist or antagonist is anchored to the receptor through the carboxylate side chain of Asp113 in the third transmembrane helix. Other interactions between specific residues of the receptor and functional groups on the ligand have also been proposed. The interaction between the beta AR and the G protein Gs has been shown to involve an intracellular region that is postulated to form an amphiphilic alpha helix. This region of the beta AR is also critical for sequestration, which accompanies agonist-mediated desensitization, to occur. Structural similarities among G protein-linked receptors suggest that the information gained from the genetic analysis of the beta AR should help define functionally important regions of other receptors of this class."

https://openalex.org/W2080602316,"Use of in situ hybridization optimized for fluorescent detection of nuclear RNA has revealed a striking localization of specific viral RNAs within nuclei of cells latently infected with EBV. Several hundred kb of specific transcripts is sharply restricted to a small region of the nucleus, frequently in a curvilinear ""track"". Detection of nuclear RNA was evidenced by hybridization without denaturation, sensitivity to RNAase, inhibition by actinomycin D, and specificity of transcribed sequences. Results indicate that RNA ""tracks"" extend from an internal genome into the nuclear periphery, and that RNA transport may be coupled to transcription. Localized nRNA is apparent for other viral sequences, different lymphoblastoid cell lines, nuclei prepared by two different methods, and an abundant, nonviral transfected sequence. Implications for understanding nuclear organization and the investigation of gene expression are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2040063578,"A homolog of the fission yeast cdc2-encoded protein kinase (p34) is a component of M phase promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. The homologous kinase in human HeLa cells is maximally active during mitosis, suggesting a mitotic role in mammalian somatic cells. This has been directly investigated by microinjection of anti-p34 antibodies into serum-stimulated rat fibroblasts. DNA synthesis was unaffected but cell division was quantitatively blocked in injected cells. Injection of antibodies against p13suc1, a component of the p34 kinase complex, did not block mitosis but caused mitotic abnormalities resulting in cells containing multiple micronuclei in the subsequent interphase. p34 localized in the nucleus during interphase. During mitosis, a fraction tightly associated with centrosomes. p13 was more evenly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm. These observations demonstrate that cdc2 is a nuclear and centrosomal protein that is required for mitosis in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1998220537,"Nucleosome core particles differing in their levels of histone acetylation have been formed on a closed circular DNA that contains a tandemly repeated 207 bp nucleosome positioning sequence. The effect of acetylation on the linking number per nucleosome particle has been determined. With increasing levels of acetylation, the negative linking number change per nucleosome decreases from -1.04 +/- 0.08 for control to -0.82 +/- 0.05 for highly acetylated nucleosomes. These results indicate that histone acetylation has the ability to release negative supercoils previously constrained by nucleosomes into a closed chromatin loop and in effect function as a eukaryotic gyrase."
https://openalex.org/W2136595144,"The CD4 molecule is a T cell surface glycoprotein that interacts with high affinity with the envelope glycoprotein of the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, thus serving as a cellular receptor for this virus. To define the sites on CD4 essential for binding to gp120, we produced several truncated, soluble derivatives of CD4 and a series of 26 substitution mutants. Quantitative binding analyses with the truncated proteins demonstrate that the determinants for high affinity binding lie solely with the first 106 amino acids of CD4 (the V1 domain), a region having significant sequence homology to immunoglobulin variable regions. Analysis of the substitution mutants further defines a discrete binding site within this domain that overlaps a region structurally homologous to the second complementarity-determining region of antibody variable domains. Finally, we demonstrate that the inhibition of virus infection and virus-mediated cell fusion by soluble CD4 proteins depends on their association with gp120 at this binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2071273803,The signal recognition particle (SRP)-mediated transport of proteins across mammalian endoplasmic reticulum requires GTP in a capacity distinct from polypeptide elongation. We defined the role of GTP by a molecular characterization of translocation intermediates that accumulate after incubation of SRP-ribosome complexes with microsomal membranes. SRP receptor-catalyzed displacement of SRP from ribosomes was GTP-dependent both with intact membranes and with the purified SRP receptor. GTP-specific binding was localized to the alpha subunit of the receptor by photoaffinity labeling and by probing nitrocellulose blots of the receptor with GTP. Analysis of the alpha subunit of the SRP receptor revealed amino acid sequences that are similar to guanine ribonucleotide binding site consensus sequence elements.
https://openalex.org/W2049583570,"The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (Cl-MPR) sorts newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes in the Golgi and endocytoses extracellular lysosomal enzymes. To determine the role of the 163 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of the Cl-MPR in these functions, receptor-deficient mouse L cells were transfected with normal bovine Cl-MPR cDNA or cDNAs mutated in the cytoplasmic domain. The normal Cl-MPR functioned in sorting and endocytosis. Mutant receptors with 40 and 89 residues deleted from the carboxyl terminus of the cytoplasmic tail functioned normally in endocytosis, but were partially impaired in sorting. Mutant receptors with larger deletions leaving only 7 and 20 residues of the cytoplasmic tail were defective in endocytosis and sorting. A mutant receptor containing alanine instead of tyrosine residues at positions 24 and 26 was defective in endocytosis, and partially impaired in sorting. Receptors deficient in endocytosis accumulated at the cell surface. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of the Cl-MPR contains different signals for rapid endocytosis and efficient lysosomal enzyme sorting."
https://openalex.org/W2022340574,"Membrane fusion induced by the envelope glycoproteins of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIVmac) is a necessary step for the infection of CD4 cells and for the formation of syncytia after infection. Identification of the region in these molecules that mediates the fusion events is important for understanding and possibly interfering with HIV/SIVmac infection and pathogenesis. Amino acid substitutions were made in the 15 NH2-terminal residues of the SIVmac gp32 transmembrane glycoprotein, and the mutants were expressed in recombinant vaccinia viruses, which were then used to infect CD4-expressing T cell lines. Mutations that increased the overall hydrophobicity of the gp32 NH2-terminus increased the ability of the viral envelope to induce syncytia formation, whereas introduction of polar or charged amino acids in the same region abolished the fusogenic function of the viral envelope. Hydrophobicity in the NH2-terminal region of gp32 may therefore be an important correlate of viral virulence in vivo and could perhaps be exploited to generate a more effective animal model for the study of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1912630452,"Abstract Multiple isoforms of tropomyosin (TM) of rat cultured cells show differential effects on actin-severing activity of gelsolin. Flow birefringence measurements have revealed that tropomyosin isoforms with high Mr values (high Mr TMs) partially protect actin filaments from fragmentation by gelsolin, while tropomyosins with low Mr values (low Mr TMs) have no significant protection even when the actin filaments have been fully saturated with low Mr TMs. We have also examined effect of nonmuscle caldesmon on the severing activity of gelsolin because 83-kDa nonmuscle caldesmon stimulates actin binding of rat cell TMs (Yamashiro-Matsumura, S., and Matsumura, F. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 106, 1973-1983). While nonmuscle caldesmon alone or low Mr TMs alone show no significant protection against fragmentation by gelsolin, the low Mr TMs coupled with 83-kDa protein are able to protect actin filaments. Further, high Mr TMs together with 83-kDa protein appear to block the severing activity completely. Electron microscopic analyses of length distribution of actin filaments have confirmed the results. The average length of control actin filaments is measured as 1.46 +/- microns, and gelsolin shortens the average length to 0.084 +/- 0.039 micron. Similar short average lengths are obtained when gelsolin severs actin complexed with low Mr TMs (0.080 +/- 0.045 micron) or with nonmuscle caldesmon (0.11 +/- 0.072 micron) while longer average length (0.22 +/- 0.18 micron) is measured in the presence of high Mr TMs. The simultaneous addition of nonmuscle caldesmon makes the average length considerably longer, i.e. 0.61 +/- 0.37 micron in the presence of low Mr TMs and 1.57 +/- 0.97 micron in the presence of high Mr TMs. Furthermore, the actin binding of gelsolin is strongly inhibited by co-addition of high Mr TMs and nonmuscle caldesmon. These results suggest that TM and gelsolin share the same binding site on actin molecules and that the differences in the actin affinities between TMs are related to their abilities of protection against gelsolin."

https://openalex.org/W1964303657,"Tumor promoters may bring about events that lead to neoplastic transformation by inducing specific promotion-relevant effector genes. Functional activation of the transacting transcription factor AP-1 by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) may play an essential role in this process. Clonal genetic variants of mouse epidermal JB6 cells that are genetically susceptible (P+) or resistant (P-) to promotion of transformation by TPA were transfected with 3XTRE-CAT, a construct that has AP-1 cis-enhancer sequences attached to a reporter gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Transfected JB6 P+, but not P- variants, showed TPA-inducible CAT synthesis. Epidermal growth factor, another transformation promoter in JB6 cells, also caused P+ specific induction of CAT gene expression. These results demonstrate an association between induced AP-1 function and sensitivity to promotion of neoplastic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2085295693,"We have characterized the effect of murine p53 on SV40 DNA replication in vitro. Purified wild-type murine p53 dramatically inhibited the ability of SV40 T antigen to mediate the replication of a plasmid bearing the viral origin (ori-DNA) in vitro. In contrast, polyoma ori-DNA replication in vitro was unaffected by p53. Surprisingly, both unbound p53 and SV40 T antigen-bound p53 were equally detrimental to SV40 ori-DNA replication. Thus, p53 interferes with interactions between T antigen molecules that are required for DNA synthesis. p53 inhibited the binding to and subsequent unwinding of the SV40 origin by T antigen and thus selectively blocked the initial stages of ori-DNA replication. In contrast to the nononcogenic wild-type murine p53, high concentrations of a mutant transforming p53 failed to block SV40 ori-DNA replication in vitro. These observations may provide insight into a possible role for p53 in the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2029234227,"S. pombe centromeres are large and complex. We introduced a method that enables us to characterize directly centromere DNAs. Genomic DNA fragments containing cen1, cen2, or cen3, respectively, are made by cleaving NotI sites integrated on target sites and are partially restricted for long-range mapping in PFG electrophoresis. The 40 kb long cen1 consists of two inverted approximately 10 kb motifs, each containing centromeric elements dg and dh, flanked by a central region. In cen2, three motifs are arranged in inverted and direct orientations with flanking domains, making up the approximately 70 kb long repetitious region. In cen3, approximately 15 copies of dg-dh constitute a region longer than 100 kb. A set of inverted motifs with an approximately 15 kb central region might be a prototype for the S. pombe centromeres. The motifs appear to play a role in chromosome stability and segregation. Their action may be additive, and the mutual directions of dg and dh inside a motif may not be essential for function."
https://openalex.org/W1550274156,"Abstract Acyclovir triphosphate (ACVTP) was a substrate for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA polymerase and was rapidly incorporated into a synthetic template-primer designed to accept either dGTP or ACVTP followed by dCTP. HSV-1 DNA polymerase was not inactivated by ACVTP, nor was the template-primer with a 3'-terminal acyclovir monophosphate moiety a potent inhibitor. Potent inhibition of HSV-1 DNA polymerase was observed upon binding of the deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate coded by the template subsequent to the incorporation of acyclovir monophosphate into the 3'-end of the primer. The Ki for the dissociation of dCTP (the next nucleotide) from this dead-end complex was 76 nM. In contrast, the Km for dCTP as a substrate for incorporation into a template-primer containing dGMP in place of acyclovir monophosphate at the 3'-primer terminus was 2.6 microM. The structural requirements for effective binding of the nucleotide revealed that the order of potency of inhibition of a series of analogs was: dCTP much greater than arabinosyl-CTP greater than 2'-3'-dideoxy-CTP much greater than CTP, dCMP, dCMP + PPi. In the presence of the required deoxynucleotide (dCTP), high concentrations of dGTP compete with ACVTP for binding and thus retard the formation of the dead-end complex. This results in a first-order loss of enzyme activity indistinguishable from that expected for a mechanism-based inactivator. The reversibility of the dead-end complex was demonstrated by steady-state kinetic analysis, analytical gel filtration, and by rapid gel filtration through Sephadex G-25. Studies indicated that potent, reversible inhibition by ACVTP and the required deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate also occurred when poly(dC)-oligo(dG) or activated calf thymus DNA were used as the template-primer."

https://openalex.org/W1518970589,"Abstract Two isozymic forms of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (designated types I alpha and I beta) were purified to homogeneity from bovine aorta smooth muscle. Type I alpha was apparently the same as the well characterized bovine lung cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Type I beta had a subunit Mr = 80,000 compared with Mr = 78,000 for type I alpha, and both forms were dimeric with similar calculated native Mr (170,000-178,000). Both enzymes contained two cGMP-binding sites per subunit, exhibited similar specificities for the peptide substrates tested, photoaffinity labeled with 8-N3[32P] cAMP, and catalyzed autophosphorylation. Silver-stained peptide maps of types I alpha and I beta were similar but not identical; however, autoradiographs of peptide maps of these enzymes prelabeled by either autophosphorylation or photoaffinity labeling showed clearly different patterns. The amino-terminal sequence of a breakdown product of type I beta could not be aligned confidently with any of the published sequence of bovine lung cGMP-dependent protein kinase. [3H]cGMP dissociation curves for types I alpha and I beta were both biphasic, but the dissociation rate of the slow component of type I beta was faster than the corresponding component of type I alpha. The concentration of cGMP required for half-maximal activation (K alpha) was slightly lower for type I alpha than for type I beta (0.29 and 0.44 microM, respectively), and the two enzymes had similar K alpha values for cAMP (16 and 18 microM, respectively). Types I alpha and I beta exhibited different K alpha values for several cGMP analogs. The abundance of type I beta in specific tissues suggested that it could have an important physiological role."

https://openalex.org/W1578535097,"The effects of halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane on ionic currents induced by bath application of gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) were studied with the rat dorsal root ganglion neurons maintained in primary culture. The whole-cell patch clamp technique was used to record the current. In normal neurons before exposure to anesthetics, GABA at low concentrations (1-3 x 10(-6) M) induced a small sustained inward current. At higher concentrations (3 x 10(-5) M-1 x 10(-3) M), GABA induced a large inward current, which decayed to a steady-state level (desensitization). Halothane (0.86 mM), isoflurane (0.96 mM), and enflurane (1.89 mM), each equivalent to the respective 2 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) units, augmented the sustained current evoked by 3 x 10(-6) M GABA to 330-350% of control and the peak current evoked by 3 x 10(-5) M of GABA to 136-145% of control. The decay phase of the current was accelerated by the anesthetics, the time for the current to decline to 70% of the peak being reduced to 23-39% of control. In contrast, the densitized steady-state current evoked by high concentrations of GABA was decreased by anesthetics. In conclusion, general anesthetics exert a dual effect on the GABA receptor channel complex: to potentiate the nondesensitized (both peak and sustained) current and to suppress the desensitized steady-state current. The potentiation of the GABA receptor channel response may be a primary action of anesthetics leading to surgical anesthesia."
https://openalex.org/W2052810325,"Detailed kinetics reveal that EGF-induced S6 kinase activation is biphasic: an early phase appears at 10-15 min, followed by a late phase between 30 and 60 min. Both activities exhibit the same chromatographic behavior and sensitivity to phosphatase 2A. Direct activation of protein kinase C by TPA induces only late phase activity. Down-regulation of protein kinase C leads to loss of both TPA- and EGF-induced late phase activity, while the early phase is unaffected. The loss of late phase kinase activity results in decreased EGF-induced S6 phosphorylation, protein synthesis, and cell growth. The results indicate that EGF differentially regulates S6 kinase activation by two distinct signaling pathways and that loss of the late or protein kinase C-dependent phase leads to a diminished mitogenic response."
https://openalex.org/W2081413800,"Two adjacent genes in Bradyrhizobium japonicum, fbcF and fbcH, encode the Rieske iron sulfur protein and cytochromes b and c1, characteristic constituents of the respiratory complex III. Remarkably, fbcH is a single gene of which the 5′ half codes for cytochrome b and the 3′ half codes for cytochrome c1. Experimental evidence suggests that a large FbcH precursor is posttranslationally processed into the two proteins. B. japonicum fbcF and fbcH insertion mutants grow aerobically but are unable to fix nitrogen in root nodule symbiosis with soybean. Thus, fbcF and fbcH are symbiotically essential. We propose that B. japonicum makes use of a cytochrome bc1-containing respiratory chain on its way to become a microaerobic endosymbiont, whereas under aerobiosis, respiration can occur by a bc1-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2063501255,"In the Mov13 mouse mutant, transcription of the α1(I) collagen gene is blocked by a retroviral insert in the first intron. We now report that teeth derived from homozygous embryos produce a dentin layer containing normal amounts of collagen I. In situ hybridization and RNAase protection experiments indicate that the mutant allele is efficiently transcribed in odontoblasts, in contrast to other cell types. Correct splicing of the primary transcript containing the viral sequence results in a functional α1(I) collagen mRNA. The absence of a mutagenic effect in odontoblasts, as opposed to fibroblasts, suggests that the retroviral insert interferes with tissue-specific transcriptional control of the α1(I) collagen gene, most likely by inactivating cell-type-specific cis-acting regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W1588686556,"Abstract Heterologous gene expression in yeast can be increased up to several hundred-fold by expressing a foreign gene as a fusion to the ubiquitin gene. An endogenous yeast endoprotease (Ub-Xase) removes the ubiquitin from the fusion product to produce the authentic protein. The utility of this technique has been demonstrated by expression of three different proteins in yeast as both unfused and ubiquitin-fused forms: 1) the alpha subunit of the mammalian stimulating G-protein of the adenylate cyclase complex (Gs alpha); 2) a soluble fragment of the T cell receptor protein (sCD4); and 3) the protease domain of human urokinase (UKP). The sequence specificity of the Ub-Xase was demonstrated by mutagenesis of the carboxyl-terminal glycine of ubiquitin to an alanine, which inhibited ubiquitin removal in vivo. Processing of the ubiquitin-Gs alpha fusion protein (ub-Gs alpha) in vivo resulted in Gs alpha which could be reconstituted in mammalian membrane preparations and had the same specific activity as the authentic Gs alpha expressed in yeast. The yeast Ub-Xase has also been shown to work in vitro by the processing of a ub-sCD4 fusion protein synthesized in Escherichia coli. This technology should greatly enhance the utility of yeast for heterologous protein production."
https://openalex.org/W1598136695,"The existence of multiple receptor sites for the psychotomimetic agents phencyclidine (PCP) and some opiate-benzomorphans such as (+)N-allylnormetazocine ([+]SKF 10,047) in the mammalian central nervous system is well documented. These are: 1) sigma/PCP (sigma p) site, which binds both PCP and psychotomimetic opiates but not antipsychotics such as haloperidol, 2) PCP site, which selectively binds PCP analogs, and 3) sigma/haloperidol (sigma h) site, for which certain antipsychotics and (+)SKF 10,047, but not PCP analogs, display high affinity. In this study we examined the regulation of these receptor sites after chronic treatment of mice with either PCP or haloperidol. The following radiolabeled ligands were used to assess binding to the various receptor subtypes: [3H]-1-[1-[3-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine ([3H]PCP-3-OH; sigma p and PCP sites), [3H]thienyl-phencyclidine ([3H]TCP; PCP site), (+)-[3H]SKF 10,047 (sigma p and sigma h sites), and [3H]haloperidol (sigma h and D-2 dopamine receptors). Treatment of mice for 1, 7, 14, and 21 days with PCP (10 mg.kg-1.day-1) failed to induce variations in sigma p, sigma h, and PCP receptor binding. However, similar treatment with haloperidol (4 mg.kg-1.day-1) induced: 1) complete elimination of the binding to sigma h sites, 2) up-regulation of D-2 dopamine receptors, and 3) no change in sigma p and PCP receptor binding after 14 or 21 days of treatment. However, a single day of haloperidol treatment or in vitro incubation of mouse brain membranes with haloperidol failed to alter receptor binding. This study suggests that prolonged treatment of mice with haloperidol induces a loss in sigma h receptors that are presumably associated with certain psychotomimetic effects. This phenomenon is accompanied by an up-regulation of D-2 dopamine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2095050229,"Homothallic switching in S. cerevisiae involves replacing the DNA of the expressed allele at the mating type locus (MAT) with a duplicate of sequences from the unexpressed loci HML or HMR. The MATa and MAT alpha alleles differ by a DNA substitution that is flanked by sequences in common to MAT, and the donor loci HML and HMR. Using restriction site polymorphisms between MAT and the donor loci, we demonstrate that the extent of MAT DNA that is replaced during switching is variable and that there is a gradient of coconversion across the X region. Coconversion events occur on both sides of the double-strand cleavage by the HO gene product. The two cells produced after a switch often differ at the flanking site, indicating a DNA heteroduplex intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2065673428,"The rapid transductional sequences initiated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on binding to its receptor regulate functional and genomic responses in many cells but are not well defined. Induction of macrophage activation is an example of such functional and genomic changes in response to IFN-gamma. Addition of IFN-gamma to murine macrophages, at activating concentrations, produced rapid (within 60 seconds) alkalinization of the cytosol and a concomitant, rapid influx of 22Na+. Amiloride inhibited the ion fluxes and the accumulation of specific messenger RNA for two genes induced by IFN-gamma (the early gene JE and the beta chain of the class II major histocompatibility complex gene I-A). The data indicate that IFN-gamma initiates rapid exchange of Na+ and H+ by means of the Na+/H+ antiporter and that these amiloride-sensitive ion fluxes are important to some of the genomic effects of IFN-gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1525695077,"Prior studies showed that sphingomyelinase action and the free sphingoid bases inhibited protein kinase C (Kolesnick, R. N., and Clegg, S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6534-6537). The present studies investigated whether sphingomyelinase action also inhibited a biologic process mediated via protein kinase C, phorbol ester-induced differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic cells into macrophages. The potent phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) stimulated time- and concentration-dependent conversion of HL-60 cells into macrophages, ED50 congruent to 5 x 10(-10) M. Differentiation involved growth inhibition, adherence of the suspended cells to tissue culture plastic, morphologic changes, and development of specific enzymatic markers. Sphingomyelinase, which increased the level of sphingoid bases and inactivated protein kinase C, prevented this event. In control incubations, cell number increased 2.10-fold over 24 h, and 2 +/- 1% of the cells were adherent. In incubations with TPA (0.5 nM), cell number increased only 1.75-fold, and 30% were adherent. Sphingomyelinase (3.8 x 10(-5) unit/ml) restored growth to incubations containing TPA to 2.02-fold and reduced adherence to 15%. Sphingomyelinase (3.8 x 10(-2) unit/ml) also restored growth partially and reduced adherence to a maximal concentration of TPA (3 nM). Similar results were obtained with the sphingoid base sphingosine (3-4.5 microM). Sphingomyelinase antagonized the morphologic changes associated with conversion to the macrophage phenotype. Untreated HL-60 cells presented typical promyelocytic morphology with large nuclei, little cytoplasm, and uniformity of nuclear and cell shape. TPA induced a larger cell population with abundant cytoplasm and unusual shape. Sphingomyelinase prevented these changes. Sphingomyelinase blocked TPA-induced increases in the macrophage marker enzymes, acid phosphatase and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase. These studies indicate that the action of a sphingomyelinase, like the sphingoid bases, blocks phorbol ester-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells into macrophages and provides further support for the concept that sphingomyelinase action may be sufficient to comprise a physiologically relevant inhibitory pathway for protein kinase C."

https://openalex.org/W2401926188,"Studies in recent years have indicated that secretion of certain lysosomal hydrolases can be enhanced under various conditions. One such protein, the major excreted protein (MEP) of Kirsten virus-transformed NIH 3T3 (KNIH) fibroblasts, is a lysosomal cysteine protease whose synthesis and secretion are affected by viral transformation and growth factors. We have been studying the synthesis and transport of MEP in order to understand better the mechanisms responsible for regulation of lysosomal enzyme secretion. Synthesis of MEP in KNIH cells was found to be 25-fold greater than that in untransformed NIH cells, and 94% of the MEP made was secreted. This was in contrast to NIH cells which secreted only 11% of the newly synthesized MEP. The high level of secretion by the transformed cells was relatively specific in that most other lysosomal enzymes were retained. MEP isolated from both NIH and KNIH cells exhibited a low intrinsic affinity for the mannose-6-phosphate receptor which was at least 10-fold lower than that of other lysosomal enzymes. On the basis of these results, we suggest that both the high level of MEP synthesis and the intrinsic low affinity of MEP for the receptor are responsible for the specific increase in MEP secretion by transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1580875833,"Abstract The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPRCI) functions in the packaging of both newly made and extracellular lysosomal enzymes into lysosomes. The subcellular location of MPRCI reflects these two functions; receptor is found in the Golgi complex, in endosomes, and on the cell surface. To learn about the intracellular pathway followed by surface receptor and to study the relationship between the receptor pools, we examined the entry of the surface MPRCI into Golgi compartments that contain sialyltransferase. Sialic acid was removed from surface-labeled K562 cultured human erythroleukemia cells by neuraminidase treatment. When the cells were returned to culture at 37 degrees C, surface MPRCI was resialylated by the cells with a half-time of 1-2 h. Resialylation was inhibited by reduced temperature, a treatment that allows surface molecules to reach endosomes but blocks further transport. These results indicate that surface MPRCI is transported to the sialyltransferase compartment in the Golgi complex. After culture at 37 degrees C, a small fraction (10-20%) of the resialylated receptor was found on the cell surface. Because a similar fraction of the total receptor pool is found on the cell surface, it is likely that cell surface MPRCI mixes with the cellular pool after resialylation. These data also support the idea that extracellular and newly made lysosomal enzymes are transported to lysosomes through a common compartment."
https://openalex.org/W7093677,"The rpoH (htpR) gene of Escherichia coli encodes a sigma factor which confers upon RNA polymerase the ability to recognize the promoters for genes responsive to the phenomenon termed the heat shock response. dnaA protein, a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, is required for initiation of chromosomal replication by binding to sites within the chromosomal origin. dnaA protein also autoregulates its expression by binding to a site in the dnaA promoter region. Two copies of the dnaA protein recognition sequence are present within the rpoH promoter region. Using filter binding assays, dnaA protein was observed to bind specifically to DNA fragments containing the rpoH promoter region with greater affinity than its binding to the dnaA promoter region. By contrast, reduced binding to a DNA fragment containing the lacUV5 promoter was observed. DNase I footprint analysis indicated that dnaA protein protected specific sites within the rpoH promoter region. The binding of dnaA protein to the rpoH promoter region resulted in transcriptional repression from two of the three promoters of the rpoH gene in vitro. Elevated levels of dnaA protein repressed transcription from these two rpoH promoters in vivo. These results indicate that dnaA protein regulates rpoH transcription to influence the expression of genes under rpoH control."
https://openalex.org/W150675690,"Mutations have been introduced into the Escherichia coli lac Y gene by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis such that the lactose carrier contains either tyrosine or phenylalanine in place of histidine 322. These mutants did not carry out active accumulation of lactose, melibiose, or methyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, but facilitated diffusion was still catalyzed. Galactoside-dependent H+ transport, measured with the pH electrode, was retained in both mutants. We conclude that although histidine 322 is important for energy transduction, neither an electronegative atom nor a dissociable proton is essential for proton cotransport with lactose or melibiose."
https://openalex.org/W1480034158,"Abstract Two enzymatic activities, 2-acylglycerolphosphoethanolamine (2-acyl-GPE) acyltransferase and acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) synthetase, were solubilized and purified from Escherichia coli membranes. Electrophoretic analysis of the final product of the purification procedure revealed a single protein species with an apparent molecular mass of 27 kilodaltons. The ratio of acyltransferase to synthetase activities remained the same throughout the purification scheme indicating that both activities were catalyzed by the same enzyme. 2-Acyl-GPE acyltransferase exhibited an apparent ACP Km of 64 nM under standard assay conditions that increased to 10 microM when the assay was conducted in the presence of 0.4 M LiCl. Acyl-ACP synthetase activity was not detected in the absence of 0.4 M LiCl, and the apparent ACP Km for this reaction was 16 microM. Direct evidence that ACP was a subunit of the acyltransferase/synthetase was obtained by the adsorption of both catalytic activities to an ACP-Sepharose affinity column and by the binding of [3H]ACP to the purified enzyme preparation. The apparent Km for acyl-ACP was 13 microM, and the rate of acyl transfer from this acyl donor was enhanced by the addition of 0.4 M LiCl indicating that the exchange of enzyme-bound ACP for acyl-ACP was a determinant factor in the rate of phosphatidylethanolamine formation from acyl-ACP. These data indicate that the 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase and acyl-ACP synthetase reactions are catalyzed by the same membrane protein that possesses a high affinity binding site for soluble ACP."
https://openalex.org/W2119561579,"Polyclonal antibodies were prepared against recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) that reacted only with bFGF but not acidic FGF. These antibodies were able to inhibit various biological activities of bFGF such as the ability of bFGF to stimulate DNA synthesis in 3T3 cells, proliferation and migration of bovine capillary endothelial cells (BCEC), and neurite extension in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The anti-bFGF antibodies also inhibited the mitogenic activity of subendothelial cell extracellular matrix for BCEC, demonstrating that the growth factor component in extracellular matrix required for supporting BCEC proliferation was bFGF. Anti-bFGF antibodies inhibited the cross-linking of bFGF to its high affinity receptor on BCEC cells. However, these antibodies did not inhibit the binding of bFGF to heparin-Sepharose or to the low affinity receptors of BCEC which have been demonstrated to be heparin-like molecules. These results suggest that bFGF has distinct domains for binding to high affinity cellular receptors and for binding to heparin."
https://openalex.org/W2007773500,"We have characterized transgenic mice carrying a functional T cell receptor (TCR) Cγ4 (Vγ1.1Jγ4Cγ4) gene. Results indicate that active transcription of the Cγ4 transgene can influence expression of the endogenous Cγ4, Cγ1 (Vγ3-, Vγ4-, Vγ2-, or Vγ5Jγ1Cγ1) and Cγ2 (Vγ1.2Jγ2Cγ2) genes, while the ultimate expression of other TCR δ, α, and β chain genes, as well as the adult T cell response, are relatively unaltered. Cells expressing transgenic Cγ4 and endogenous δ TCR transcripts can migrate to the skin as dendritic epithelial cells (DEC) even though Cγ4 cells are rarely, if at all, found in the skin. Transgenic and control mice were compared at 2 weeks, 6–7 weeks, and older. At 2 weeks, the thymus of transgenic mice, particularly the medulla, was much larger than control. Moreover, peripheral lymphoid tissues of younger mice were markedly (as much as 100-fold) more immunoreactive (both Con A response and alloreactivity). These differences, although persistent, became smaller in older mice. The data suggest that transgene expression has a major effect on T cell development and reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1534202267,"The gene for subunit II of cytochrome oxidase (CoII) from bovine mitochondria has been cloned behind a T7 promoter and the corresponding mRNA synthesized in vitro. The RNA transcribed from this vector has a single nucleotide 5' to the start AUG and, thus, corresponds closely to the native mRNA. It binds to the small 28 S ribosomal subunit of bovine mitochondria but not to the large (39 S) subunit or to 55 S ribosomes. The binding occurs readily in the absence of auxiliary initiation factors or initiator tRNA. The complex formed appears to contain 1 mRNA/28 S subunit. The observed binding is specific for mRNA since neither tRNA nor ribosomal RNA can act as competitive inhibitors. The interaction of the mRNA with the 28 S subunit does not require an AUG codon near the 5' end and constructs containing 5' leaders of more than 100 nucleotides still bind efficiently. About 5% of the bound mRNA is protected from digestion by T1 RNase. The protected fragments do not arise from a specific region of the mRNA since they hybridize to several restriction fragments of the cloned CoII gene."
https://openalex.org/W2002142869,"The effects of beta-estradiol (estrogen; a minor component of yeast cells) on S. cerevisiae cells in the G0 and G1 phases were examined. Results showed that estrogen stimulated the recovery of growth from G0 arrest induced by nutrient limitation or ts mutation of cdc35 (adenylate cyclase) in the early G1 phase, and inhibited entry into the resting G0 phase by increasing the intracellular cAMP level. However, estrogen had no effect on late G1 arrest induced by the alpha factor or ts mutation of cdc36. Estrogen was found to lead to higher steady-state levels of adenylate cyclase mRNA but not to affect the expression of the RAS1 and RAS2 genes, although these can also alter the intracellular cAMP level. These results suggest that estrogen influences the cell cycle of yeast in the early G1 phase by controlling the level of cAMP through the increase of adenylate cyclase mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1515289842,"ARPP-21 (cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr = 21,000) is a cytosolic neuronal phosphoprotein that is highly enriched in regions of mammalian brain that receive dopaminergic innervation, in particular the striatum. The state of phosphorylation of ARPP-21 in brain slices prepared from rat striatum was shown to be regulated by 8-bromo-cyclic AMP. Phosphorylation occurred exclusively on seryl residues contained within a single tryptic phosphopeptide as analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis/chromatography. The tryptic phosphopeptide derived from ARPP-21 phosphorylated in intact cells comigrated with the tryptic phosphopeptide derived from purified ARPP-21 phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro. Purified cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzed the incorporation of 1.1 mol of [32P]phosphate/mol of ARPP-21 exclusively on seryl residues. The amino acid sequence surrounding the site in purified ARPP-21 phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro was determined by analyzing two overlapping chymotryptic peptides isolated from [32P]phospho-ARPP-21 by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. A combination of gas phase and solid phase amino acid sequencing yielded a phosphorylation site sequence of -Glu-Arg-Arg-Lys-Ser(P)-Lys-Ser-Gly-Ala-Gly-. Initial rate studies of the phosphorylation of purified ARPP-21 by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase yielded an apparent Km of 0.78 microM and a kcat of 2.2 s-1. A synthetic peptide based on the phosphorylation site of ARPP-21 was phosphorylated on the corresponding seryl residue with an apparent Km of 40 microM and a kcat of 4.0 s-1. These results are compatible with a physiological role for the phosphorylation of ARPP-21 by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in vivo, regulated by first messengers acting via cyclic AMP, e.g. dopamine and vasoactive intestinal peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1512888705,"Abstract We have investigated the mechanism of stimulation of thyroglobulin gene expression by thyrotropin (TSH) and cAMP in rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells. In contrast to the c-fos gene, induction of the thyroglobulin gene by TSH or cAMP is slow (10 h) and sensitive to cycloheximide treatment. We have identified a TSH and cAMP-responsive region of thyroglobulin gene between - 171 and - 140 base pairs from the transcription initiation site. The hormone-responsive region contains DNA sequence elements similar to the consensus cAMP-responsive element as well as the transcription factor AP-1-binding site but with opposite sequence polarity. Three DNA-protein complexes are formed when the hormone-responsive region is incubated with nuclear extracts of FRTL-5 cells. Formation of these complexes is dependent on TSH or cAMP stimulation, thus suggesting that the factors involved in binding to the hormone-responsive region may be induced by TSH. Although the identity of these factors is not yet known, they do not appear to be related to either cAMP-responsive element-binding protein or AP-1. These results suggest that thyroglobulin gene expression in FRTL-5 cells may be mediated by nuclear factors that are induced by cAMP in contrast to other genes (e.g. c-fos) whose activation involves post-translational modification of the pre-existing proteins specific for cAMP-responsive element."

https://openalex.org/W1530369860,"Circular plasmid DNA was efficiently converted into huge catenated intranuclear networks by incubation with isolated nuclei in the presence of ATP. The network production is abolished by omission of ATP, strongly inhibited by etoposide (VP-16), but only slightly inhibited by antibody to topoisomerase I, indicating that the major enzyme responsible for catenation is DNA topoisomerase II. Under optimal conditions, a single nucleus incorporates about 4.2 × 104 DNA rings into its networks. Under the light microscope, networks retrieved from nuclei appear like spheres of various sizes. Sedimentation analysis showed that most of the networks are composed of thousands of catenated rings, which was confirmed by electron microscopy. Data from experiments that caused partial disruption of the networks were submitted to analysis based on probable models of catenane structure. The results suggest that the predominant pattern is a linear alignment of catenated rings. Similar networks are formed when the nuclear scaffold is incubated with circular DNA in the presence of nuclear extract containing topoisomerase II. Titration experiments showed that the scaffold binds a stoichiometric amount of the substrate and that a critical level of DNA is required for network formation. The results are consistent with the idea that DNA-binding sites are fixed on the scaffold and mediate catenation of bound DNA circles by holding them in close proximity to each other. We propose that catenation by the nuclear scaffold also occurs in intact nuclei, suggesting additional roles for the scaffold in vivo."
