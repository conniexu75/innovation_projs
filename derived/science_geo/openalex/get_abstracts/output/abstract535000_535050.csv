Inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, but exactly how is not fully understood. Warnatsch et al. now show that immune cells called neutrophils release NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps) (see the Perspective by Nahrendorf and Swirski). These NETs are composed of DNA and antimicrobial proteins, and in the setting of atherosclerosis they activate innate immune signaling pathways in macrophages. This causes the macrophages to secrete proinflammatory cytokines, exacerbating the disease. Indirectly, NETS also attract a specialized subset of T cells that further amplify the proinflammatory response. Science , this issue p. 316 ; see also p. 237"
https://openalex.org/W1878234215,"Immune systems distinguish ""self"" from ""nonself"" to maintain homeostasis and must differentially gate access to allow colonization by potentially beneficial, nonpathogenic microbes. Plant roots grow within extremely diverse soil microbial communities but assemble a taxonomically limited root-associated microbiome. We grew isogenic Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with altered immune systems in a wild soil and also in recolonization experiments with a synthetic bacterial community. We established that biosynthesis of, and signaling dependent on, the foliar defense phytohormone salicylic acid is required to assemble a normal root microbiome. Salicylic acid modulates colonization of the root by specific bacterial families. Thus, plant immune signaling drives selection from the available microbial communities to sculpt the root microbiome."

The debate concerns whether diversity peaks at intermediate levels of productivity—the so-called humped-back model—or whether there is no clear predictable relationship. Fraser et al. used a large, standardized, and geographically diverse sample of grasslands from six continents to confirm the validity and generality of the humped-back model. Their findings pave the way for a more mechanistic understanding of the factors controlling species diversity. Science , this issue p. 302"
https://openalex.org/W1518704304,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. PARK2 mutations cause early-onset forms of PD. PARK2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Parkin, that can selectively translocate to dysfunctional mitochondria to promote their removal by autophagy. However, Parkin knockout (KO) mice do not display signs of neurodegeneration. To assess Parkin function in vivo, we utilized a mouse model that accumulates dysfunctional mitochondria caused by an accelerated generation of mtDNA mutations (Mutator mice). In the absence of Parkin, dopaminergic neurons in Mutator mice degenerated causing an L-DOPA reversible motor deficit. Other neuronal populations were unaffected. Phosphorylated ubiquitin was increased in the brains of Mutator mice, indicating PINK1-Parkin activation. Parkin loss caused mitochondrial dysfunction and affected the pathogenicity but not the levels of mtDNA somatic mutations. A systemic loss of Parkin synergizes with mitochondrial dysfunction causing dopaminergic neuron death modeling PD pathogenic processes."

Park et al. studied free-floating platinum nanoparticles using electron microscopy and liquid cells (see the Perspective by Colliex). Using analytical techniques developed to study biological molecules, they reconstructed the threedimensional features of the Pt particles at near-atomic resolution. This approach has the scope to study a mixed population of particles one at a time and to study their synthesis as it occurs in solution. Science , this issue p. 290 ; see also p. 232"
https://openalex.org/W1567742360,"We propose a neurocomputational model of altruistic choice and test it using behavioral and fMRI data from a task in which subjects make choices between real monetary prizes for themselves and another. We show that a multi-attribute drift-diffusion model, in which choice results from accumulation of a relative value signal that linearly weights payoffs for self and other, captures key patterns of choice, reaction time, and neural response in ventral striatum, temporoparietal junction, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The model generates several novel insights into the nature of altruism. It explains when and why generous choices are slower or faster than selfish choices, and why they produce greater response in TPJ and vmPFC, without invoking competition between automatic and deliberative processes or reward value for generosity. It also predicts that when one’s own payoffs are valued more than others’, some generous acts may reflect mistakes rather than genuinely pro-social preferences."
https://openalex.org/W1681312898,"The germinal center (GC) is a microanatomical compartment wherein high-affinity antibody-producing B cells are selectively expanded. B cells proliferate and mutate their antibody genes in the dark zone (DZ) of the GC and are then selected by T cells in the light zone (LZ) on the basis of affinity. Here, we show that T cell help regulates the speed of cell cycle phase transitions and DNA replication of GC B cells. Genome sequencing and single-molecule analyses revealed that T cell help shortens S phase by regulating replication fork progression, while preserving the relative order of replication origin activation. Thus, high-affinity GC B cells are selected by a mechanism that involves prolonged dwell time in the DZ where selected cells undergo accelerated cell cycles."

These methods can extend our knowledge and provide new tools for enhancing health and wellbeing. However, they raise questions about how to best address potential threats to privacy while reaping benefits for individuals and to society as a whole. The use of machine learning to make leaps across informational and social contexts to infer health conditions and risks from nonmedical data provides representative scenarios for reflections on directions with balancing innovation and regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1489974657,"Neurexins are considered central organizers of synapse architecture that are implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Expression of neurexins in hundreds of alternatively spliced isoforms suggested that individual neurons might exhibit a cell-type-specific neurexin expression pattern (a neurexin code). To test this hypothesis, we quantified the single-cell levels of neurexin isoforms and other trans-synaptic cell-adhesion molecules by microfluidics-based RT-PCR. We show that the neurexin repertoire displays pronounced cell-type specificity that is remarkably consistent within each type of neuron. Furthermore, we uncovered region-specific regulation of neurexin transcription and splice-site usage. Finally, we demonstrate that the transcriptional profiles of neurexins can be altered in an experience-dependent fashion by exposure to a drug of abuse. Our data provide evidence of cell-type-specific expression patterns of multiple neurexins at the single-cell level and suggest that expression of synaptic cell-adhesion molecules overlaps with other key features of cellular identity and diversity."
https://openalex.org/W1542273561,"One pathological hallmark in ALS motor neurons (MNs) is axonal accumulation of damaged mitochondria. A fundamental question remains: does reduced degradation of those mitochondria by an impaired autophagy-lysosomal system contribute to mitochondrial pathology? We reveal MN-targeted progressive lysosomal deficits accompanied by impaired autophagic degradation beginning at asymptomatic stages in fALS-linked hSOD1(G93A) mice. Lysosomal deficits result in accumulation of autophagic vacuoles engulfing damaged mitochondria along MN axons. Live imaging of spinal MNs from the adult disease mice demonstrates impaired dynein-driven retrograde transport of late endosomes (LEs). Expressing dynein-adaptor snapin reverses transport defects by competing with hSOD1(G93A) for binding dynein, thus rescuing autophagy-lysosomal deficits, enhancing mitochondrial turnover, improving MN survival, and ameliorating the disease phenotype in hSOD1(G93A) mice. Our study provides a new mechanistic link for hSOD1(G93A)-mediated impairment of LE transport to autophagy-lysosomal deficits and mitochondrial pathology. Understanding these early pathological events benefits development of new therapeutic interventions for fALS-linked MN degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1592663088,"Single sensory neurons can be surprisingly predictive of behavior in discrimination tasks. We propose this is possible because sensory information extracted from neural populations is severely restricted, either by near-optimal decoding of a population with information-limiting correlations or by suboptimal decoding that is blind to correlations. These have different consequences for choice correlations, the correlations between neural responses and behavioral choices. In the vestibular and cerebellar nuclei and the dorsal medial superior temporal area, we found that choice correlations during heading discrimination are consistent with near-optimal decoding of neuronal responses corrupted by information-limiting correlations. In the ventral intraparietal area, the choice correlations are also consistent with the presence of information-limiting correlations, but this area does not appear to influence behavior, although the choice correlations are particularly large. These findings demonstrate how choice correlations can be used to assess the efficiency of the downstream readout and detect the presence of information-limiting correlations."
https://openalex.org/W2127946557,"Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) summer on the sea ice or, where it melts, on shore. Although the physiology of ""ice"" bears in summer is unknown, ""shore"" bears purportedly minimize energy losses by entering a hibernation-like state when deprived of food. Such a strategy could partially compensate for the loss of on-ice foraging opportunities caused by climate change. However, here we report gradual, moderate declines in activity and body temperature of both shore and ice bears in summer, resembling energy expenditures typical of fasting, nonhibernating mammals. Also, we found that to avoid unsustainable heat loss while swimming, bears employed unusual heterothermy of the body core. Thus, although well adapted to seasonal ice melt, polar bears appear susceptible to deleterious declines in body condition during the lengthening period of summer food deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W1900636106,"Dissecting the functional roles of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in cortical circuits is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. Of particular interest are their roles in emergent cortical computations such as binocular integration in primary visual cortex (V1). We measured the binocular response selectivity of genetically defined subpopulations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons received strong inputs from both eyes but lacked selectivity for binocular disparity. Because broad selectivity could result from heterogeneous synaptic input from neighboring neurons, we examined how individual PV+ interneuron selectivity compared to that of the local neuronal network, which is primarily composed of excitatory neurons. PV+ neurons showed functional similarity to neighboring neuronal populations over spatial distances resembling measurements of synaptic connectivity. On the other hand, excitatory neurons expressing CaMKIIα displayed no such functional similarity with the neighboring population. Our findings suggest that broad selectivity of PV+ interneurons results from nonspecific integration within local networks.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI1YWI3YmQwOWM0ZTc0Y2JlNTc3MTNkMjc1MTE3NzEwZSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NTY2NDE0fQ.BjRmnLG4n5W2_7HPBtAYwXOrivHd0Y4pbTFP5E1Rl3Y4i-4QVPPtRxacpUPuXMJFkAJadeMKuBreNU1iow3rcS1FLd6xCjVjVUrA2qub-zJV6F1db5HV0bP2JbEs7PIr0r8VyCCYZU8mwkDDQ-ri2JjddZVFSoxzOQpgQ4XDM9dyvA6fcsW5lHrvQv0y3AL3O6v_VKxjn9ftAkQRYqoQz8oKkehmFiQTsmtpHE_nsTQMp5wwp8F42W7WMUqO_aQ5v7xeElwdeFynCL8VU7w6SJZ9TP43jXibubf6bX5nRFIA9Uq3V5b1vLH-KvOb-St-7aPAjHszOXrT4TglhC3oBw(mp4, (14.08 MB) Download video"

The β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is involved in Alzheimer’s disease, plays a role in synapse formation, and is upregulated in intellectual disabilities. Here, we show that during mouse synaptogenesis and in human FXS fibroblasts, a dual dysregulation of APP and the α-secretase ADAM10 leads to the production of an excess of soluble APPα (sAPPα). In FXS, sAPPα signals through the metabotropic receptor that, activating the MAP kinase pathway, leads to synaptic and behavioral deficits. Modulation of ADAM10 activity in FXS reduces sAPPα levels, restoring translational control, synaptic morphology, and behavioral plasticity. Thus, proper control of ADAM10-mediated APP processing during a specific developmental postnatal stage is crucial for healthy spine formation and function(s).

While it is well accepted that the brain undergoes critical periods in its development, the molecular basis of these critical periods is not fully understood. The events that shape the brain during development influence processing of new information, acquisition of new skills, and formation of memories throughout life. Proper synaptic contacts, trans synaptic signaling, and structural remodeling are essential aspects of synapse maturation and stabilization during postnatal brain development (Grant, 2012Grant S.G.

Electrical compartmentalization in dendritic spines.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 36: 429-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Fine-tuned expression of several proteins is fundamental for the synaptic structure, the establishment of synaptic networks, and neuronal plasticity (Sala and Segal, 2014Sala C. Segal M. Dendritic spines: the locus of structural and functional plasticity.Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94: 141-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Changes in dendritic spine morphology and plasticity are associated with various neurodevelopmental diseases, such as Down syndrome, Rett syndrome, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and Fragile X syndrome (FXS) (Sala and Segal, 2014Sala C. Segal M. Dendritic spines: the locus of structural and functional plasticity.Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94: 141-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). FXS is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and about 30% of FXS children meet the criteria for ASD (Jacquemont et al., 2007Jacquemont S. Hagerman R.J. Hagerman P.J.

At the cellular level, FXS neurons have an increased number of dendritic spines that appear long, thin, and tortuous (Hinton et al., 1991Hinton V.J. Brown W.T. Wisniewski K. Rudelli R.D.

Through four RNA-binding domains, FMRP associates with messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding pre- and postsynaptic proteins and regulates multiple steps of mRNA metabolism, such as dendritic transport, stability, and translation (Darnell and Klann, 2013Darnell J.C.

Loss of FMRP compromises the fine-tuned expression of a variety of proteins, leading to deficits in embryonic and early postnatal brain wiring networks (La Fata et al., 2014La Fata G. Gärtner A.

Systematic evaluation of candidate ligands regulating ectodomain shedding of amyloid precursor protein.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 3264-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A wide range of APP functions have been described in both the developing and adult brain, including neurite outgrowth, synaptic development and plasticity, cell adhesion, protein trafficking, and cell migration (Hoe et al., 2012Hoe H.S. Lee H.K. Pak D.T. The upside of APP at synapses.CNS Neurosci. Ther. 2012; 18: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Müller and Zheng, 2012Müller U.C. Zheng H. Physiological functions of APP family proteins.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2: a006288Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Consistent with its functions, APP expression is high during spine formation and progressively declines after synaptic maturation (Moya et al., 1994Moya K.L. Benowitz L.I. Schneider G.E.

Alterations of synaptic structure and function are therefore well established features of APP dysregulation, although the underlying complex molecular mechanism(s) are poorly understood.

The disintegrin metalloprotease ADAM10 is the constitutive α-secretase required for sAPPα generation (Kuhn et al., 2010Kuhn P.H. Wang H. Dislich B. Colombo A. Zeitschel U. Ellwart J.W. Kremmer E.

A different APP processing pathway, mediated by the β-secretase BACE1, cleaves APP, generating a soluble form of APP (sAPPβ) and a C-terminal membrane-associated fragment (CTFβ). The formation of β-amyloid (Aβ40-42) in the brain is critical for AD progression (Karran et al., 2011Karran E. Mercken M. De Strooper B.

Alzheimer’s disease is a synaptic failure.Science. 2002; 298: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3393) Google Scholar). Here, we highlight the critical role played by FMRP in coordinating the production of sAPPα in the brain. Soluble APPα accumulates in the FXS brain as a result of excessive synthesis of APP and ADAM10 proteins during a critical postnatal period. The excess of generated sAPPα drives an increase in protein synthesis, formation of immature spines, and impaired synaptic plasticity. This cascade of events requires the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 signaling and activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Finally, we show that modulation of ADAM10 activity at FXS synapses ameliorates various molecular, synaptic, and behavioral defects in FXS. The levels of APP are increased when FMRP is absent (Westmark and Malter, 2007Westmark C.J. Malter J.S. FMRP mediates mGluR5-dependent translation of amyloid precursor protein.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e52Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) or when CYFIP1 levels are decreased in juvenile mice (Napoli et al., 2008Napoli I. Mercaldo V. Boyl P.P. Eleuteri B. Zalfa F. De Rubeis S. Di Marino D. Mohr E. Massimi M. Falconi M. et al.The fragile X syndrome protein represses activity-dependent translation through CYFIP1, a new 4E-BP.Cell. 2008; 134: 1042-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Because FXS is a neurodevelopmental disorder, we characterized the changes of APP expression during brain development in the Fmr1 KO mouse model (Bakker, 1994Bakker C. The Dutch-Belgian Fragile X ConsortiumFmr1 knockout mice: a model to study fragile X mental retardation.Cell. 1994; 78: 23-33PubMed Google Scholar). Whole brain extracts from wild-type (WT) and Fmr1 KO mice were analyzed during early postnatal stages (P7, P14, and P21) and adulthood (P30 and P90). No differences in APP expression were observed between WT and KO mice at P7 and P14, whereas a significant upregulation was observed in the Fmr1 KO mice starting at 3 weeks after birth (P21) and was maintained throughout adulthood (Figure 1A). A similar dysregulation was observed at synapses (Figure 1B). App mRNA steady-state levels were not changed in the absence of FMRP (Figure S1A). Therefore, absence of FMRP leads to increased APP expression in the brain during a period critical for the stabilization of synapses and development of brain functions (Grant, 2012Grant S.G. Synaptopathies: diseases of the synaptome.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2012; 22: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, Yuste, 2013Yuste R. Electrical compartmentalization in dendritic spines.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 36: 429-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the excess of APP in FXS might be pathogenic due to elevated Aβ release (Westmark and Malter, 2007Westmark C.J. Malter J.S. FMRP mediates mGluR5-dependent translation of amyloid precursor protein.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e52Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We measured Aβ levels in cortex during synaptogenesis and in adulthood. Unexpectedly, we observed a significant decrease in Aβ in juvenile Fmr1 KO mice compared to WT (Figure 2A). Only at the adult stage are Aβ levels increased (Figure 2A). We next analyzed the production of secreted sAPP and CTFs using specific antibodies (Figures S2A, S4B, and S4C). Brains were fractionated (Figure S2B) and the levels of sAPP (total sAPP, sAPPα, and sAPPβ) quantified. Absence of FMRP leads to a parallel increase of APP and sAPP protein levels between the third and fifth postnatal week (P21–P30) (Figures 1A and 2B). Specifically, we found a rise in sAPPα levels in juvenile (P21) Fmr1 KO mice and a decrease in β-cleavage (less sAPPβ; Figure 2C). We next investigated APP processing at FXS synapses by measuring the CTFs generated in the synaptic membrane. Using an established biochemical synaptosome fractionation (Galli et al., 1996Galli T.

Cattabeni F. Sala C. Padovani A. Di Luca M. Synapse-associated protein-97 mediates alpha-secretase ADAM10 trafficking and promotes its activity.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we isolated detergent resistant membrane from synaptoneurosomes (DRM; Figure S2C). These samples are enriched in membrane-associated proteins, such as Synaptophysin, PSD95, Flotillin, and NMDA receptor subunits. We found that APP protein levels were less abundant in the synaptic membranes isolated from Fmr1 KO (Figure 2D). In the absence of FMRP, the levels of CTFα (∼10 kDa) generated by α-secretase activity were increased, whereas CTFβ (∼12 kDa), the β-secretase product, was decreased (Figure 2D). The altered CTFα/CTFβ ratio suggests that α-secretase activity is specifically upregulated in juvenile Fmr1 KO animals. Because α- and β-secretases compete to cleave APP, the observed reduction of sAPPβ, CTFβ, and Aβ supports a skewed APP processing toward the non-amyloidogenic pathway in the Fmr1 KO during early stages of development and a possible switch toward the β-cleavage at later stages. The concomitant increase in sAPPα and decrease of sAPPβ protein levels in the Fmr1 KO suggested that APP was highly processed at the cell surface. First, we determined total and surface APP levels in cortical neurons from WT and KO mice by immunofluorescence (Figure 2E). Total APP levels were detected by an antibody against the cytoplasmic domain (A8717; Figures S2A and S2B) and the surface level of APP using an antibody against its ectodomain (22C11; Figures S2A and S2B). Total APP levels were higher in Fmr1 KO than in WT cortical neurons, as in brain extracts, but the surface APP was lower in the FMRP-deficient cells (Figure 2E). To corroborate our data, we biotinylated and captured cell-surface proteins and analyzed the precipitate by western blotting (WB) (Figure 2F). Although the total APP expression was increased in Fmr1 KO mice, the surface APP was decreased. Both experiments showed that, in FMRP-deficient neurons, the global expression of APP is increased; however, there is a steep decrease in full-length APP protein levels at the cell surface (Figures 2E and 2F). While we cannot rule out that a defect in APP trafficking could also contribute to the reduced APP present at the cell surface, the decrease in surface APP and the parallel increase in sAPP released in the media of Fmr1 KO neurons (Figure 2G) strongly support that APP processing at the membrane is upregulated. To identify the mechanisms underlying the decreased APP at the cell surface and the increased sAPPα release in FXS, we measured the expression levels of the constitutive APP α-secretase ADAM10 (Jorissen et al., 2010Jorissen E. Prox J. Bernreuther C. Weber S. Schwanbeck R. Serneels L. Snellinx A. Craessaerts K. Thathiah A. Tesseur I. et al.The disintegrin/metalloproteinase ADAM10 is essential for the establishment of the brain cortex.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4833-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). WB of cortical (Figure 3A) and synaptic lysates (Figure 3B) showed a parallel increase in the expression of APP and mature ADAM10 in the absence of FMRP, while the synaptic expression of two other metalloproteases ADAM9 and 17 did not change (Figure 3B). Furthermore, the absence of FMRP leads to a developmental stage-specific increase of ADAM10 (Figure 3C), correlating with the increased production of sAPPα between the third and fourth postnatal week (Figure 2B). The increase of ADAM10 in Fmr1 KO cortical neurons was confirmed by immunofluorescence (Figure 3D). Opposite distribution to APP was observed for the mature ADAM10 protein, which was increased at the cell-surface (Figure 3E), where it cleaves APP to generate sAPPα (Lichtenthaler, 2011Lichtenthaler S.F. α-secretase in Alzheimer’s disease: molecular identity, regulation and therapeutic potential.J. Neurochem. 2011; 116: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The increased ADAM10 expression in the Fmr1 KO mice, at this specific developmental stage, did not result in a dysregulation of other protein targets such as Notch and N-cadherin (Figure S3). Overall, these observations support the conclusion that FMRP, by coordinating both APP and ADAM10 expression, specific"

https://openalex.org/W1795771003,"HIV-Tat has been demonstrated to be secreted from cells in a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2)-dependent manner. Here we show that HIV-Tat forms membrane-inserted oligomers, a process that is accompanied by changes in secondary structure with a strong increase in antiparallel β sheet content. Intriguingly, oligomerization of HIV-Tat on membrane surfaces leads to the formation of membrane pores, as demonstrated by physical membrane passage of small fluorescent tracer molecules. Although membrane binding of HIV-Tat did not strictly depend on PI(4,5)P2 but, rather, was mediated by a range of acidic membrane lipids, a functional interaction between PI(4,5)P2 and HIV-Tat was critically required for efficient membrane pore formation by HIV-Tat oligomers. These properties are strikingly similar to what has been reported previously for fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), providing strong evidence of a common core mechanism of unconventional secretion shared by HIV-Tat and fibroblast growth factor 2."

In this study, we have analyzed the programmed cell death mechanisms that are induced when cells interact with the Tag7-Hsp70 complex, which was previously shown to be released by human lymphocytes and is cytotoxic to cancer cells. We show that this complex induces both apoptotic and necroptotic processes in the cells. Apoptosis follows the classic caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation pathway. Inhibition of apoptosis leads to a switch to the RIP1-dependent necroptosis. Both of these cytotoxic processes are initiated by the involvement of TNFR1, a receptor for TNF-α. Our results suggest that the Tag7-Hsp70 complex is a novel ligand for this receptor. One of its components, the innate immunity protein Tag7, can bind to the TNFR1 receptor, thereby inhibiting the cytotoxic actions of the Tag7-Hsp70 complex and TNF-α, an acquired immunity cytokine."
https://openalex.org/W1908131837,"Background Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis which typically begins in early adulthood and impacts on healthcare resource utilisation and the ability to work. Previous studies examining the cost of AS have relied on patient-reported questionnaires based on recall. This study uses a combination of patient-reported and linked-routine data to examine the cost of AS in Wales, UK. Methods Participants in an existing AS cohort study (n = 570) completed questionnaires regarding work status, out-of-pocket expenses, visits to health professionals and disease severity. Participants gave consent for their data to be linked to routine primary and secondary care clinical datasets. Health resource costs were calculated using a bottom-up micro-costing approach. Human capital costs methods were used to estimate work productivity loss costs, particularly relating to work and early retirement. Regression analyses were used to account for age, gender, disease activity. Results The total cost of AS in the UK is estimated at £19016 per patient per year, calculated to include GP attendance, administration costs and hospital costs derived from routine data records, plus patient-reported non-NHS costs, out-of-pocket AS-related expenses, early retirement, absenteeism, presenteeism and unpaid assistance costs. The majority of the cost (>80%) was as a result of work-related costs. Conclusion The major cost of AS is as a result of loss of working hours, early retirement and unpaid carer’s time. Therefore, much of AS costs are hidden and not easy to quantify. Functional impairment is the main factor associated with increased cost of AS. Interventions which keep people in work to retirement age and reduce functional impairment would have the greatest impact on reducing costs of AS. The combination of patient-reported and linked routine data significantly enhanced the health economic analysis and this methodology that can be applied to other chronic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1845706276,"Kinetic and thermodynamic data have been analyzed according to transition state theory and a simplified reaction scheme for the enzymatic hydrolysis of insoluble cellulose. For the cellobiohydrolase Cel7A from Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei), we were able to measure or collect relevant values for all stable and activated complexes defined by the reaction scheme and hence propose a free energy diagram for the full heterogeneous process. For other Cel7A enzymes, including variants with and without carbohydrate binding module (CBM), we obtained activation parameters for the association and dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complex. The results showed that the kinetics of enzyme-substrate association (i.e. formation of the Michaelis complex) was almost entirely entropy-controlled and that the activation entropy corresponded approximately to the loss of translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the dissolved enzyme. This implied that the transition state occurred early in the path where the enzyme has lost these degrees of freedom but not yet established extensive contact interactions in the binding tunnel. For dissociation, a similar analysis suggested that the transition state was late in the path where most enzyme-substrate contacts were broken. Activation enthalpies revealed that the rate of dissociation was far more temperature-sensitive than the rates of both association and the inner catalytic cycle. Comparisons of one- and two-domain variants showed that the CBM had no influence on the transition state for association but increased the free energy barrier for dissociation. Hence, the CBM appeared to promote the stability of the complex by delaying dissociation rather than accelerating association. Kinetic and thermodynamic data have been analyzed according to transition state theory and a simplified reaction scheme for the enzymatic hydrolysis of insoluble cellulose. For the cellobiohydrolase Cel7A from Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei), we were able to measure or collect relevant values for all stable and activated complexes defined by the reaction scheme and hence propose a free energy diagram for the full heterogeneous process. For other Cel7A enzymes, including variants with and without carbohydrate binding module (CBM), we obtained activation parameters for the association and dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complex. The results showed that the kinetics of enzyme-substrate association (i.e. formation of the Michaelis complex) was almost entirely entropy-controlled and that the activation entropy corresponded approximately to the loss of translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the dissolved enzyme. This implied that the transition state occurred early in the path where the enzyme has lost these degrees of freedom but not yet established extensive contact interactions in the binding tunnel.

Activation enthalpies revealed that the rate of dissociation was far more temperature-sensitive than the rates of both association and the inner catalytic cycle. Comparisons of one- and two-domain variants showed that the CBM had no influence on the transition state for association but increased the free energy barrier for dissociation. Hence, the CBM appeared to promote the stability of the complex by delaying dissociation rather than accelerating association. Free energy diagrams are undoubtedly one of the most useful and fundamental ways to illustrate and explain enzyme catalysis, and essentially any biochemistry textbook uses profiles of free energy and reaction coordinates to introduce enzyme function. However, in the case of enzyme activity at interfaces (i.e. heterogeneous enzyme catalysis), free energy diagrams have rarely been used. This may appear surprising in light of the common use of such diagrams within related fields, including catalysis at inorganic interfaces, and further analyses of free energy barriers appear promising in mechanistic studies of interfacial enzyme catalysis, which is common both in vivo (1Gelb M.H. Min J.H. Jain M.K. Do membrane-bound enzymes access their substrates from the membrane or aqueous phase: interfacial versus non-interfacial enzymes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and in technology (2Illanes A. Wilson L. Vera C. Problem Solving in Enzyme Biocatalysis.

Biotechnol. 2002; 13: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). In the current work, we present free energy profiles for the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose with special emphasis on activation parameters for complexation and dissociation of enzyme and the insoluble substrate. Specifically, we investigated cellobiohydrolases from the glycoside hydrolase family 7. These enzymes utilize the retaining catalytic mechanism, which is similar to that seen in many other glycoside hydrolase families and understood on an atomistic level (4Vocadlo D.J. Davies G.J.

Mechanisms of glycosyl transferases and hydrolases.Carbohydr. Polym. 2001; 44: 325-337Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cellobiohydrolases have recently attracted particular research interest, which is at least in part driven by their role in different present day challenges, including the distribution of carbon between soil and atmosphere (6Davidson E.A. Janssens I.A. Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change.Nature. 2006; 440: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (4454) Google Scholar, 7German D.P. Marcelo K.R.B.

Biotechnol. 2009; 20: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Here, we examine the wild-type and some variants of two cellobiohydrolases (both called Cel7A) from Hypocrea jecorina and Rasamsonia emersonii. One key element of the aforementioned retaining mechanism is a transient glycosyl enzyme intermediate that is flanked by oxocarbenium ion-like transition states (4Vocadlo D.J. Davies G.J. Mechanistic insights into glycosidase chemistry.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 539-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and the properties of these species for the specific case of Cel7A hydrolyzing cellulose have recently been discussed on the basis of different types of molecular modeling (9Li J.

This theoretical work has provided important information on the structure and processive movement of the cellulose strand in the 5-nm-long binding tunnel, which houses the active site, and suggested (12Barnett C.B.

One study computed a catalytic rate constant around 11 s−1 for glycosylation (14Knott B.C. Haddad Momeni M. Crowley M.F. Mackenzie L.F. Götz A.W. Sandgren M. Withers S.G. Ståhlberg J. Beckham G.T.

Traffic jams reduce hydrolytic efficiency of cellulase on cellulose surface.Science. 2011; 333: 1279-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In most cases, however, the maximal specific rate at quasi-steady state for a monocomponent cellobiohydrolase hydrolyzing insoluble cellulose at room temperature is 1 or 2 orders of magnitude lower than this (16Cruys-Bagger N.

Chem. 2011; 286: 169-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in the companion article (71Sørensen T.H. Cruys-Bagger N. Windahl M.S. Badino S.F. Borch K. Westh P. Temperature effects on kinetic parameters and substrate affinity of Cel7A cellobiohydrolases.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 22193-22202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which showed maximal specific rates, pVmax/E0 (subscript p in front of the parameter indicates its relationship to the processive Scheme 1 in the companion article), of about 0.1 s−1 at room temperature for the investigated Cel7A enzymes. The divergence between kcat (defined as the turnover of the Michaelis complex in the inner catalytic cycle) and the maximal steady state rate probably relies on the heterogeneous process for Cel7A, which in addition to the catalytic steps that parallel those seen for glycoside hydrolases acting on soluble substrates includes adsorption to and dissociation from the insoluble substrate. Thus, before reaching the Michaelis complex, the enzyme must adsorb to the interface, diffuse laterally to find an attack site, and translocate a sizable piece of the cellulose strand (∼10 glucopyranose units) from the crystalline substrate into the binding tunnel. Different arguments have been made that this multifaceted association process or its reversal (dissociation) at the end of a processive run could be much slower than the inner catalytic cycle and hence that the on- or off-rate, rather than the actual catalysis, could be rate-limiting for cellobiohydrolases (16Cruys-Bagger N.

Signatures of activation parameters reveal substrate-dependent rate determining steps in polysaccharide turnover by a family 18 chitinase.Carbohydr. Polym. 2010; 81: 14-20Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This latter interpretation would reconcile the disparity of kcat and pVmax/E0 simply because the catalytic cycle was a comparably faster step and hence had little influence on the overall reaction rate at quasi-steady state. Unfortunately, molecular details of the association and dissociation steps are not nearly as well understood as the catalytic cycle. This is at least in part because adsorbed species cannot be crystallized and hence structural changes along the adsorption (and desorption) reaction path remain mostly unknown. To elucidate some aspects of the association and dissociation steps, we combined kinetic and thermodynamic data from the companion article (71Sørensen T.H. Cruys-Bagger N. Windahl M.S. Badino S.F. Borch K. Westh P. Temperature effects on kinetic parameters and substrate affinity of Cel7A cellobiohydrolases.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 22193-22202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), additional measurements reported here, and literature data and analyzed these data along the lines of the transition state theory. Based on this, we have proposed a free energy diagram for the course of the heterogeneous catalysis and estimated enthalpic and entropic contributions to the free energy changes. As indicated above, structural and kinetic information on adsorption and desorption is still too elusive to design and analyze a full heterogeneous reaction scheme composed by elementary reactions (akin to those describing the catalytic cycle (14Knott B.C. Haddad Momeni M. Crowley M.F. Mackenzie L.F. Götz A.W. Sandgren M. Withers S.G. Ståhlberg J. Beckham G.T.

Soc. 2014; 136: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)). Instead, we used a coarser approach, which merges some putative steps and describes processive catalysis by three composite rate constants and a processivity number (26Cruys-Bagger N. Elmerdahl J. Praestgaard E. Borch K. Westh P. A steady-state theory for processive cellulases.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 3952-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Praestgaard E. Elmerdahl J. Murphy L.

Incomplete models such as this have previously proven useful in attempts to assess properties of stable and activated complexes along the reaction path of complicated enzyme reactions (28Laidler K.J. Peterman B.F. Temperature effects in enzyme kinetics.Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 234-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Lonhienne T. Gerday C. Feller G.

Biotechnol. 2007; 9: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), although exact correlations between free energy and structure obviously cannot be established when elementary steps have been lumped together in composite reactions. The analysis showed that complexation (formation of the Michaelis complex) and dissociation of Cel7A were limited by comparable free energy barriers but that the balance of entropic and enthalpic contributions was very different for these two steps. This provided some fundamental information on the nature of the transition states, the role of the carbohydrate binding domain (CBM), 2The abbreviations used are: CBMcarbohydrate binding domainCOREcatalytic domainPSSpre-steady stateHjCBMcellobiohydrolase Cel7A from H. jecorina (wild type with CORE and CBM)HjCOREH. jecorina Cel7A variant without CBMReCORECel7A from R. emersonii (wild type without CBM)ReCBMchimeric enzyme with CORE from R. emersonii and CBM from H. jecorina. and the sensitivity to temperature of these two steps. carbohydrate binding domain catalytic domain pre-steady state cellobiohydrolase Cel7A from H. jecorina (wild type with CORE and CBM) H. jecorina Cel7A variant without CBM Cel7A from R. emersonii (wild type without CBM) chimeric enzyme with CORE from R. emersonii and CBM from H. jecorina. We used the same cellobiohydrolases as in the companion article (71Sørensen T.H. Cruys-Bagger N. Windahl M.S. Badino S.F. Borch K. Westh P.

Chem. 2015; 290: 22193-22202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and procedures regarding cloning, expression, purification, and concentration determination are described there. The enzymes were Cel7A wild types from, respectively, R. emersonii (Re) and H. jecorina (Hj) (often identified by the name of its anamorph, Trichoderma reesei). The latter is a two-domain enzyme with a catalytic domain (CORE) module and a CBM, whereas the former has a one-domain architecture with no CBM. We also investigated a one-domain variant of the Hj enzyme without linker and CBM and a chimera composed of the Re enzyme and the linker and CBM from Hj Cel7A. In the following, we will use the same abbreviations as in the companion article (71Sørensen T.H. Cruys-Bagger N. Windahl M.S. Badino S.F. Borch K. Westh P.

Chem. 2015; 290: 22193-22202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) for these four enzymes, i.e. HjCBM, ReCORE, HjCORE, and ReCBM, respectively. To estimate processivity, we measured the concentrations of products generated by the four enzymes at temperatures from 10 to 50 °C (i.e. the same temperature range used for the kinetic measurements in the companion article (71Sørensen T.H. Cruys-Bagger N. Windahl M.S. Badino S.F. Borch K. Westh P. Temperature effects on kinetic parameters and substrate affinity of Cel7A cellobiohydrolases.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 22193-22202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). The reactions were started by the addition of 80 μl of enzyme stock solution to 920 μl of preheated or -cooled Avicel solution in 2-ml Eppendorf tubes. The final enzyme concentration was 0.40 μm as in the kinetic experiments in the companion article (71Sørensen T.H. Cruys-Bagger N. Windahl M.S. Badino S.F. Borch K. Westh P.

All samples were incubated for 1 h with orbital shaking at 1100 rpm and subsequently quenched by 100 μl of 1.0 m NaOH. Following centrifugation for 3 min at 3500 rpm at 5 °C (Hereaus Multifuge 3 S-R), the concentrations of glucose, cellobiose, and cellotriose in the supernatants were quantified in a Dionex ICS-5000 ion chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Details of the chromatographic procedure have been described previously (31Alasepp K. Borch K. Cruys-Bagger N. Badino S. Jensen K. Sørensen T.H. Windahl M.S. Westh P. In situ stability of substrate-associated cellulases studied by DSC.Langmuir. 2014; 30: 7134-7142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A blank (without enzyme) was included and subtracted for all measurements. To elucidate the temperature dependence of the catalytic rate constant, pkcat, we investigated the pre-steady state kinetics of HjCBM on Avicel (the same substrate as in the companion article (71Sørensen T.H. Cruys-Bagger N. Windahl M.S. Badino S.F. Borch K. Westh P. Temperature effects on kinetic parameters and substrate affinity of Cel7A cellobiohydrolases.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 22193-22202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). We measured the production of cellobiose in real time with an amperometric biosensor functionalized with the oxidoreductase cellobiose dehydrogenase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium (32Cruys-Bagger N.

A kinetic model for the burst phase of processive cellulases.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We used the experimental temperatures 5, 25, and 50 °C, and the enzyme concentration was 150 nm. Duplicate measurements were performed with 5–10 different Avicel loads between 0.5 and 5 g/liter at the three temperatures. The aim of this work was to elucidate changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of stable and activated complexes along a previously suggested reaction path for processive cellulases (26Cruys-Bagger N. Elmerdahl J. Praestgaard E. Borch K. Westh P. A steady-state theory for processive cellulases.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 3952-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Praestgaard E. Elmerdahl J.

For the current use, we made the additional assumption that consecutive processive steps will be thermodynamically similar, and we hence only include one catalytic step in the diagram. This means that the reaction sequence we want to describe may be written as shown in Scheme 1. All three steps in Scheme 1 are composite reactions that lump together different putative elementary steps. Thus, the complexation governed by pkon includes adsorption to the surface, threading, and formation of the Michaelis complex, ECm. The catalytic step incorporates the hydrolytic reaction sequence (14Knott B.C. Haddad Momeni M. Crowley M.F. Mackenzie L.F. Götz A.W. Sandgren M. Withers S.G. Ståhlberg J. Beckham G.T. The mechanism of cellulose hydrolysis by a two-step, retaining cellobiohydrolase elucidated by structural and transition path sampling studies.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) followed by one processive step and release of the product so that a new Michaelis complex with a slightly shortened strand, ECm − 1, is formed. Finally, dissociation includes dethreading of the binding tunnel and release from the surface. To appraise free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of activated and stable complexes along this path, we need values of the three rate constants and their temperature dependence together with (equilibrium) thermodynamic functions for enzyme-substrate association and hydrolysis of a glycosidic bond in cellulose. This makes up a total of 15 parameters (standard changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy for three transition states and two equilibria). In the next sections we collect this information from current experiments, the companion article (71Sørensen T.H. Cruys-Bagger N. Windahl M.S. Badino S.F. Borch K. Westh P.

Rate constants for these steps can be derived from the kinetic parameters in the companion article (71Sørensen T.H. Cruys-Bagger N. Windahl M.S. Badino S.F. Borch K. Westh P.

Many studies have suggested that n can be approximated from the relative concentrations of soluble products, although controversies remain regarding the exact interpretation of such data (33Horn S.J.

https://openalex.org/W859078965,"Cancer stem cells are cancer cells characterized by stem cell properties and represent a small population of tumor cells that drives tumor development, progression, metastasis and drug resistance. To date, the molecular mechanisms that generate and regulate cancer stem cells are not well defined. BORIS (Brother of Regulator of Imprinted Sites) or CTCFL (CTCF-like) is a DNA-binding protein that is expressed in normal tissues only in germ cells and is re-activated in tumors. Recent evidences have highlighted the correlation of BORIS/CTCFL expression with poor overall survival of different cancer patients. We have previously shown an association of BORIS-expressing cells with stemness gene expression in embryonic cancer cells. Here, we studied the role of BORIS in epithelial tumor cells. Using BORIS-molecular beacon that was already validated, we were able to show the presence of BORIS mRNA in cancer stem cell-enriched populations (side population and spheres) of cervical, colon and breast tumor cells. BORIS silencing studies showed a decrease of sphere formation capacity in breast and colon tumor cells. Importantly, BORIS-silencing led to down-regulation of hTERT, stem cell (NANOG, OCT4, SOX2 and BMI1) and cancer stem cell markers (ABCG2, CD44 and ALDH1) genes. Conversely, BORIS-induction led to up-regulation of the same genes. These phenotypes were observed in cervical, colon and invasive breast tumor cells. However, a completely different behavior was observed in the non-invasive breast tumor cells (MCF7). Indeed, these cells acquired an epithelial mesenchymal transition phenotype after BORIS silencing. Our results demonstrate that BORIS is associated with cancer stem cell-enriched populations of several epithelial tumor cells and the different phenotypes depend on the origin of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2164054760,"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process that transports cytoplasmic components to lysosomes for degradation. In addition to the canonical view of strict stress-response-induced autophagy, selectively programmed autophagy was recently reported in the context of gonad development of flies and worms, where autophagy seems to be necessary for clearance of germ plasm components. Similar functions have not been described in vertebrates. We used the medaka fish to study the role of autophagy in gonad formation and gametogenesis for the first time in a vertebrate organism for which the germ line is specified by germ plasm. Using a transgenic line deficient in the Ol-epg5 gene—a new critical component of the autophagy pathway—we show that such deficiency leads to an impaired autophagic flux, possibly attributed to compromised maturation or processing of the autophagosomes. Ol-epg5 deficiency correlates with selectively impaired spermatogenesis and low allele transmission rates of the mutant allele caused by failure of germ plasm and mitochondria clearance during the process of germ cell specification and in the adult gonads. The mouse epg-5 homolog is similarly expressed in the maturating and adult testes, suggesting an at least partially conserved function of this process during spermatogenesis in vertebrates."

The development of cartilage and bones, the core components of the skeletal system, is mediated by systematic inter- and intracellular communication among multiple signaling pathways in differentiating progenitors and the surrounding tissues. Recently, Pannexin (Panx) 3 has been shown to play important roles in bone development in vitro by mediating multiple signaling pathways, although its roles in vivo have not been explored. In this study, we generated and analyzed Panx3 knockout mice and examined the skeletal phenotypes of panx3 morphant zebrafish. Panx3-/- embryos exhibited delays in hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation and osteoblast differentiation as well as the initiation of mineralization, resulting in shortened long bones in adulthood. The abnormal progression of hypertrophic chondrogenesis appeared to be associated with the sustained proliferation of chondrocytes, which resulted from increased intracellular cAMP levels. Similarly, osteoblast differentiation and mineralization were delayed in panx3 morphant zebrafish. Taken together, our results provide evidence of the crucial roles of Panx3 in vertebrate skeletal development in vivo.—Oh, S.-K., Shin, J.-O., Baek, J.-I., Lee, J., Bae, J.

To address this, we have studied platelets, endothelial cells, and leukocytes from 2 siblings with a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α). Chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to determine levels of a broad range of eicosanoids produced by isolated vascular cells, and in plasma and urine. Eicosanoid release data were paired with studies of cellular function. Absence of cPLA2α almost abolished eicosanoid synthesis in platelets (e.g., thromboxane A2, control 20.5 ±1.4 ng/ml vs. patient 0.1 ng/ml) and leukocytes [e.g., prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), control 21.9 ± 7.4 ng/ml vs. patient 1.9 ng/ml], and this was associated with impaired platelet activation and enhanced inflammatory responses. cPLA2α-deficient endothelial cells showed reduced, but not absent, formation of prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin; control 956 ± 422 pg/ml vs. patient 196 pg/ml) and were primed for inflammation. In the urine, prostaglandin metabolites were selectively influenced by cPLA2α deficiency. For example, prostacyclin metabolites were strongly reduced (18.4% of control) in patients lacking cPLA2α, whereas PGE2 metabolites (77.8% of control) were similar to healthy volunteer levels. These studies constitute a definitive account, demonstrating the fundamental role of cPLA2α to eicosanoid formation and cellular responses within the human circulation.—Kirkby, N. S., Reed, D.

The specific fluorescent probe DAF-FM DA was coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy and used to label intracellular nitric oxide (NO) and monitoring the real-time NO dynamics during the processes of wheat defense response triggered by P. triticina infection. The results showed that at 4 h after inoculation, weak green fluorescence was observed in the stomatal guard cells at the P. triticina infection site in the incompatible combination, which indicates a small amount of NO production. Twelve hours after inoculation, the fluorescence of NO in- cell adjacent to the stomata gradually intensified, and the NO fluorescent area also expanded continuously; the green fluorescence primarily occurred in the cells undergoing a hypersensitive response (HR) at 24–72 h after inoculation. For the compatible combination, however, a small amount of green fluorescence was observed in stomata where the pathogenic contact occurred at 4 h after inoculation, and fluorescence was not observed thereafter. Injections of the NO scavenger c-PTIO prior to inoculation postponed the onset of NO production to 48 h after inoculation and suppressed HR advancement. The injection of imidazole, a NADPH oxidase inhibitor, or EGTA, an extracellular calcium chelator, in the leaves prior to inoculation, delayed the onset of NO production in the incompatible combination and suppressed HR advancement. Combined with our previous results, it could be concluded that, Ca2+ and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are involved in upstream of NO production to induce the HR cell death during P. triticina infection, and Ca2+, NO and H2O2 are jointly involved in the signal transduction process of HR in the interaction system."
https://openalex.org/W1678834485,"Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), an important human causative pathogen for viral myocarditis, pancreatitis, and meningitis, has evolved different strategies to manipulate the host signaling machinery to ensure successful viral infection. We previously revealed a crucial role for the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in regulating viral infectivity. However, the detail mechanism remains largely unknown. Grb2-associated binder 1 (GAB1) is an important docking protein responsible for intracellular signaling assembly and transduction. In this study, we demonstrated that GAB1 was proteolytically cleaved after CVB3 infection at G175 and G436 by virus-encoded protease 2A(pro), independent of caspase activation. Knockdown of GAB1 resulted in a significant reduction of viral protein expression and virus titers. Moreover, we showed that virus-induced cleavage of GAB1 is beneficial to viral growth as the N-terminal proteolytic product of GAB1 (GAB1-N1-174) further enhances ERK1/2 activation and promotes viral replication. Our results collectively suggest that CVB3 targets host GAB1 to generate a GAB1-N1-174 fragment that enhances viral infectivity, at least in part, via activation of the ERK pathway. The findings in this study suggest a novel mechanism that CVB3 employs to subvert the host signaling and facilitate consequent viral replication."

Using a cell culture model, we show that apoptotic cells potently activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a highly sensitive sensor of intracellular energy stores.

https://openalex.org/W921101719,"In rowing, perfect synchronisation is important for optimal performance of a crew. Remarkably, a recent study on ergometers demonstrated that antiphase crew coordination might be mechanically more efficient by reducing the power lost to within-cycle velocity fluctuations of the boat. However, coupled oscillator dynamics predict the stability of the coordination to decrease with increasing stroke rate, which in case of antiphase may eventually yield breakdowns to in-phase. Therefore, this study examined the effects of increasing stroke rate on in- and antiphase crew coordination in rowing dyads. Eleven experienced dyads rowed on two mechanically coupled ergometers on slides, which allowed the ergometer system to move back and forth as one ‘boat’. The dyads performed a ramp trial in both in- and antiphase pattern, in which stroke rates gradually increased from 30 strokes per minute (spm) to as fast as possible in steps of 2 spm. Kinematics of rowers, handles and ergometers were captured. Two dyads showed a breakdown of antiphase into in-phase coordination at the first stroke rate of the ramp trial. The other nine dyads reached between 34–42 spm in antiphase but achieved higher rates in in-phase. As expected, the coordinative accuracy in antiphase was worse than in in-phase crew coordination, while, somewhat surprisingly, the coordinative variability did not differ between the patterns. Whereas crew coordination did not substantially deteriorate with increasing stroke rate, stroke rate did affect the velocity fluctuations of the ergometers: fluctuations were clearly larger in the in-phase pattern than in the antiphase pattern, and this difference significantly increased with stroke rate. Together, these results suggest that although antiphase rowing is less stable (i.e., less resistant to perturbation), potential on-water benefits of antiphase over in-phase rowing may actually increase with stroke rate."

Delivery of FGF9 to renal tumors in mice yielded microvessels that were covered by pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and a collagen-fortified basement membrane.

Intravital microvascular imaging revealed a haphazard web of channels in control tumors but a network of arterioles, bona fide capillaries, and venules in FGF9-expressing tumors. Moreover, whereas vasoreactivity was absent in control tumors, arterioles in FGF9-expressing tumors could constrict and dilate in response to adrenergic and nitric oxide releasing agents, respectively. These changes were accompanied by reduced hypoxia in the tumor core and reduced expression of the angiogenic factor VEGF-A. FGF9 was found to selectively amplify a population of PDGFRβ-positive stromal cells in the tumor and blocking PDGFRβ prevented microvascular differentiation by FGF9 and also worsened metastases.

More precisely, knockdown of AAM-B abrogated production of infectious HCV particles in both Jc1 RNA electroporated cells and Jc1-infected cells. It is worth noting that knockdown of AAM-B exerted no effect on lipid droplet formation. Moreover, AAM-B interacted with nonstructural 4B (NS4B) through the C-terminal region of NS4B. Protein interplay between AAM-B and NS4B was verified in the context of HCV replication. Using either transient or stable expression of AAM-B, we verified that AAM-B colocalized with NS4B in the cytoplasm. Immunofluorescence data further showed that AAM-B might be involved in recruitment of NS4B to sites in close proximity to LDs to facilitate HCV propagation.

Two hundreds and seventy-seven type 2 diabetic patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD) and arrhythmia were recruited consecutively from the outpatient clinic of National Taiwan University Hospital. The spatially distributed QTc contour maps were constructed with 64-channel MCG using the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) system. Indices of myocardial repolarization heterogeneity including the smoothness index of QTc (SI-QTc) and QTc dispersion were derived and analyzed for association with conventional cardiovascular risk factors. SI-QTc correlated strongly with the QTc dispersion (r = 0.70, p <0.0001). SI-QTc was significantly higher in patients with presence of metabolic syndrome in comparison to those without metabolic syndrome (8.56 vs. 7.96 ms, p = 0.02).

Today, Verma is one of the few people in the world who is qualified to drive a vehicle on Mars.

Verma majored in electrical engineering in India and came to the United States to study artificial intelligence. She was captivated by the landing of the Sojourner Mars rover in 1997 and decided to apply her engineering skill to space exploration. She pursued a Ph.D. in robotics at Carnegie Mellon University and did internships with NASA's Ames Research Center. She also got her first taste of robotic exploration here on Earth by field testing a rover that surveyed South America's Atacama Desert for signs of life.

After graduating, in 2005, Verma joined the intelligent systems division at Ames Research Center as a research scientist. Later, she moved to NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), the command center for the Mars rover missions. There, her robotics expertise and experience with field testing rovers won her a chance to drive the Opportunity rover. Verma drove Opportunity for 3 years before graduating to the nuclear-powered Curiosity rover, which is now prowling Mars, examining its rocks to see whether it is, or was ever, a suitable habitat for life.

Each day, before the rover shuts down for the frigid martian night, it calls home, Verma says. Besides relaying scientific data and images it gathered during the day, it sends its precise coordinates. They are downloaded into simulation software Verma helped write. The software helps drivers plan the rover's route for the next day, simulating tricky maneuvers. Operators may even perform a dry run with a duplicate rover on a sandy replica of the planet's surface in JPL's Mars Yard. Then the full day's itinerary is beamed to the rover so that it can set off purposefully each dawn.

For the first 3 months after landing, from 5 August to 5 November 2012, the team was working on Mars time. “I loved that we didn't have to wait long after we uplinked our commands to see the results from Curiosity, and every sol (a martian day), we were doing something we'd never done before,” Verma says.

Curiosity can scoop dirt, drill rock, and hand off samples to the onboard lab. While a sample is being analyzed, Curiosity is already on its way to the next site. Verma helped write the code that lets Curiosity juggle these tasks. “We have to drive on to find newer things for the slew of instruments to analyze without compromising the rover hardware or the sample,” she says.

She loves her day-to-day responsibility for the machine. “You definitely don't want to be the one who drove the rover off a cliff! But I find it energizing rather than stressful. You're completely focused.”

But she has not left research behind. One of Verma's key research goals has been to give rovers greater autonomy to decide on a course of action. She is now working on a software upgrade that will let Curiosity be true to its name. It will allow the rover to autonomously select interesting rocks, stopping in the middle of a long drive to take high-resolution images or analyze a rock with its laser, without any prompting from Earth.

Originally designed for a 2-year mission, Curiosity is still going strong and has already made many scientifically significant finds. “With every drive, we get to explore new terrain that no human has seen in this kind of detail,” Verma says.

Although human spacefaring has stalled, Verma says the spirit of exploration is alive and well in space robots. “I am happy to be working in robotics, pushing the envelope on space exploration,” she says. “We have reached Mars, our neighboring planet. We have only just begun.”
