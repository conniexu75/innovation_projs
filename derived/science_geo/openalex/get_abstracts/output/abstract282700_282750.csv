https://openalex.org/W2097377993,"Recent developments in ion-scattering spectrometry have led to a surface crystallography that is sensitive to all elements, including hydrogen. Time-of-flight techniques for the detection of atoms scattered and recoiled from surfaces in simple collision sequences, together with calculations of shadowing and blocking cones, can be used to make direct measurements of interatomic spacings and adsorption sites within an accuracy of </=0.1 angstrom. Time-of-flight detection of both neutrals and ions provides the high sensitivity necessary for nondestructive analysis. Structures are determined by monitoring the angular anisotropies in the scattered primary and recoiled target atom flux. Such surface and adsorption site determinations find application in such fields as catalysis, thin film growth, and interfaces."

https://openalex.org/W2010645488,"After rising steadily between 1954 and 1968, the percentage of all bachelor's degrees awarded in the arts and sciences declined dramatically. These swings cannot be explained by demographic variables; however, they have been affected by changes in the academic profiles of educational institutions that were in turn related to trends in enrollment. Even more important have been the changing choices of fields of study made by men and women (particularly in the case of the humanities), in part as a consequence of widening opportunities for women. The flight from the arts and sciences now appears to be over, and in the future gender-related variables can be expected to have less impact on the distribution of degrees conferred."
https://openalex.org/W2090183580,"Monte Carlo simulations of tetrahedrally bonded SiO(2) liquid show that pressure induces large changes in the topology of its four-coordinated framework structure but leaves the average properties of local coordination environments virtually unchanged. Ring statistics are used to describe the liquid's topology; the observed changes paradoxically indicate that the liquid compresses primarily by increasing the size of its rings. A theory for the effects of ring formation on density, which also explains the density of crystalline tectosilicates, accounts for the compression of the liquid."

https://openalex.org/W1996377871,"A circadian leaf movement has been found in Phaseolus vulgaris var. Pinto that will persist under constant temperature and continuous fluorescent light. The period of leaf movement was approximately 26 hours in length, and the amplitude did not diminish for at least 4 weeks. Leaf movements were similar for plants grown in either 1100, 4950, 7700, or 10,450 lumens per square meter. This is the first clearly defined persistent circadian rhythm reported for leaves of higher plants."

After correcting for the scattered light of nearby stars and galaxies, the faint halo of this giant can be traced out to a distance of more than 1 megaparsec, making it one of the largest and most luminous galaxies known. The smoothness of this halo suggests that it was formed early in the history of the cluster."
