https://openalex.org/W2034656884,"Pulsed field gradient gel electrophoresis fractionates chromosome-sized DNA molecules from T. brucei. About 60% of the DNA remains in or close to the gel slot (large DNA). There are about three chromosomes of approximately 2 Mb, at least six chromosomes of 200-700 kb, and roughly a hundred mini-chromosomes of 50-150 kb. The basic copy genes for VSGs 118 and 221 reside in large DNA. Their activation by duplicative transposition leads to the appearance of an additional copy in the 2 Mb DNA, showing that activation involves an interchromosomal gene transposition. When gene 221 is activated without duplication, it remains in large DNA, proving that at least two sites for expression of VSG genes exist. In support of this, the mini-exons encoding the 5' 35 nucleotides of VSG messenger RNAs are in large and 2 Mb DNA. The mini-chromosomes hybridize strongly to VSG gene probes and are absent in C. fasciculata. We suggest that their main function is to provide a large pool of telomeric VSG genes."

Proc. 41, 30-34) loaded with fluorescent Ca2+ indicator quin 2 ( Tsien , R. Y. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 2396-2404) showed a rapid increase in free cytosol calcium concentration [( Ca]i) when histamine release was induced. Intracellular quin 2 concentrations up to 7 mM did not affect release of histamine in response to antigen (aggregated ovalbumin) or concanavalin A with cells primed with antigen-specific monoclonal IgE, or in response to Ca2+ ionophores. The [Ca]i increased from approximately 105 nM to a maximum of approximately 1200 nM within 2 to 3 min after antigenic stimulation and then declined slowly over 30 min toward the level in unstimulated cells. Histamine release was most rapid as [Ca]i reached the maximum value and then decreased continuously with [Ca]i over the subsequent 30 min. Neither the Ca signal nor histamine release was observed when the Ca2+ concentration in the medium [( Ca]o) was less than 50 microM, but both responses were restored on readdition of Ca2+ to 1 mM. The maximal Ca signal was obtained when [Ca]o was approximately greater than 1 mM and was half-maximal at [Ca]o congruent to 0.4 mM. In marked contrast [Ca]i in unstimulated cells varied very little with [Ca]o from 0.1 to 1 mM. Maintenance of the Ca signal required the continuous presence of stimulating ligand, external Ca2+, and the maintenance of cellular ATP; metabolic inhibitors blocked or reversed the Ca signal. La+ ions also caused a rapid and reversible block of the Ca signal and histamine release. The data are interpreted in a model in which the Ca signal is generated by a La3+-sensitive signal influx pathway that is functionally independent of the normal Ca2+ influx pathway in unstimulated cells, and that allows a 10-fold or greater increase in rate of Ca2+ entry. The Ca signal is maintained dynamically by the balance between the increased Ca2+ influx and active Ca2+ efflux across the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1987944286,"A cDNA clone YT35, synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA of the human T cell tumor Molt 3, exhibits homology to the variable (V), joining (J), and constant (C) regions of immunoglobulin genes. We have isolated and sequenced the germ-line V and J gene segment counterparts to YT35 from a human cosmid library, and these failed to encode 14 nucleotides of the cDNA clone between the V and J regions. We postulate that these 14 nucleotides are encoded by a third gene segment analogous to the diversity (D) gene segments of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes. This T cell antigen receptor V gene appears to be assembled from three gene segments, V, D, and J, and accordingly most closely resembles immunoglobulin heavy chain V genes."
https://openalex.org/W1586769740,"The primary structure of the tetrameric plasma glycoprotein human alpha 2-macroglobulin has been determined. The identical subunits contain 1451 amino acid residues. Glucosamine-based oligosaccharide groups are attached to asparagine residues 32, 47, 224, 373, 387, 846, 968, and 1401. Eleven intrachain disulfide bridges have been placed (Cys25-Cys63, Cys228-Cys276, Cys246-Cys264, Cys255-Cys408, Cys572-Cys748, Cys619-Cys666, Cys798-Cys826, Cys824-Cys860, Cys898-Cys1298, Cys1056-Cys1104, and Cys1329-Cys1444). Cys-447 probably forms an interchain bridge with Cys-447 from another subunit. The beta-SH group of Cys-949 is thiol esterified to the gamma-carbonyl group of Glx-952, thus forming an activatable reactive site which can mediate covalent binding of nucleophiles. A putative transglutaminase cross-linking site is constituted by Gln-670 and Gln-671. The primary sites of proteolytic cleavage in the activation cleavage area (the bait region) are located in the sequence: -Arg681-Val-Gly-Phe-Tyr-Glu-. The molecular weight of the unmodified alpha 2-macroglobulin subunit is 160,837 and approximately 179,000, including the carbohydrate groups. The presence of possible internal homologies within the alpha 2-macroglobulin subunit is discussed. A comparison of stretches of sequences from alpha 2-macroglobulin with partial sequence data for complement components C3 and C4 indicates that these proteins are evolutionary related. The properties of alpha 2-macroglobulin are discussed within the context of proteolytically regulated systems with particular reference to the complement components C3 and C4."
https://openalex.org/W1560018980,"Monoclonal antibody D1.1 originally prepared against the B49 cell line derived from a rat brain tumor was shown to react with a ganglioside present in fetal rat brain. We have found that this antigen is also present in human malignant melanoma tumors as well as many melanoma cell lines. The ganglioside from human melanoma cell lines migrates between GM1 and GM2 on one-dimensional thin layer chromatography. Analysis by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography with intermediate ammonia treatment suggests that the ganglioside contains one or more base-labile O-acyl esters. Mild base hydrolysis under conditions known to remove O-acyl esters results in complete loss of antigenic reactivity. Thus, the alkali-labile moiety is a critical component of the epitope recognized by the antibody. Analysis of the sialic acids of total gangliosides from [6-3H]glucosamine-labeled melanoma cells showed that approximately 10% of these molecules are O-acylated. Similar analysis of the purified ganglioside showed that greater than 30% of the sialic acids comigrated with authentic 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid. The antibody did not cross-react with normal human skin melanocytes nor with any of a large number of normal human adult and fetal tissues. The antibody also did not react with numerous other malignant cell lines studied. These findings suggest that the antigenic epitope defined by antibody D1.1 contains an O-acylated sialic acid and may arise from aberrant O-acetylation occurring in human malignant melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1519223405,"Phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its phosphorylated derivatives are rapidly broken down in 2H3 cells stimulated with antigen, with a time course which coincides with the generation of the Ca signal. Stimulated PI breakdown is absolutely dependent on Ca2+ in the medium with a concentration dependence similar to that of the Ca signal and histamine release described in the preceding paper. However, PI breakdown does not depend on the rise in free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in stimulated cells over the range 100 nM to 1 microM. Thus, stimulation by the ionophore A23187 causes only a small increase in PI breakdown and the Ca signal stimulated by antigen can be selectively blocked with appropriate concentrations of Zn2+ (100 microM) or La3+ (10-100 microM) which have small or negligible effects on stimulated PI breakdown. Both PI breakdown and the Ca signal appear to depend on a common external Ca2+ site (or sites) with Km approximately equal to 0.4 mM, and the data are consistent with either independent activation of PI phosphodiesterase and the Ca signal after antigenic stimulation, or with PI breakdown as a component of the mechanism by which the Ca signal is generated."
https://openalex.org/W1966782533,"A naturally occurring small RNA molecule ( micF RNA), complementary to the region encompassing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and initiation codon of the ompF mRNA, is known to block the expression of that mRNA in E. coli. We have constructed a plasmid that produces a complementary RNA to the E. coli lpp mRNA (mic[Ipp] RNA). Induction of the mic(Ipp) gene efficiently blocked lipoprotein production and reduced the amount of lpp mRNA. Two mic(ompC) genes were similarly engineered and their expression was found to inhibit drastically production of OmpC. Analysis of several types of mic(ompA) genes suggests that micRNAs complementary to regions of the mRNA likely to come in contact with ribosomes were most effective. The novel capabilities of this artificial mic system provide great potential for application in both procaryotic and eucaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1570617743,"The addition of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) to intact BALB/c 3T3 cells results in the rapid (less than 1 min), dose-dependent phosphorylation of a number of proteins that could be isolated by a monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody. The predominant tyrosinephosphorylated protein shared many characteristics with the PDGF receptor, including its molecular weight (170,000), isoelectric point (pI of about 4.2), its binding to DEAE-cellulose, and its pattern of binding to lectins. This 170-kDa protein, labeled with [35S] methionine, was substantially purified from PDGF-stimulated cells using the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody but was not significantly immunopurified from unstimulated cells. At 37 degrees C, phosphorylation of the 170-kDa protein was maximal by 5-10 min of exposure to PDGF, and thereafter decreased rapidly. However, at 4 degrees C, the phosphorylation continued to increase after 3 h of exposure to PDGF. Subsequently, shifting the cells from 4 to 37 degrees C resulted in an additional rapid burst of tyrosine phosphorylation. Among the other PDGF-stimulated molecules, the most prominent and consistently observed was a cytosolic, acidic (pI of about 4.2), 74-kDa protein. These findings indicate that the action of PDGF in vivo is associated with the rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of several membrane and cytosolic proteins; the most prominent of these proteins, isolated by monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine, is likely to be the PDGF receptor. The use of this antibody provides a new approach for purification of the PDGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1539182280,"A unique set of high molecular weight proteins was identified in junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles isolated from both cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle. These high Mr proteins were not present in free SR vesicles isolated from either tissue, nor were they observed in purified sarcolemmal fractions. The junctional SR high Mr proteins migrated as doublets in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and exhibited apparent Mr values between 290,000 and 350,000. The high Mr proteins bound calmodulin; they were the principal proteins labeled in the cardiac and skeletal muscle SR subfractions by azido-125I-calmodulin. The high Mr proteins were also substrates for an endogenous Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity, as well as exogenously added catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In addition, the junctional SR high Mr proteins were the major SR proteins degraded by a Ca2+-activated protease purified from smooth muscle. Control experiments verified the separation of junctional SR vesicles and free SR vesicles from both muscle types. Junctional SR vesicles were enriched in calsequestrin, and they exhibited Ca2+ uptake which was stimulated up to 10-fold by either ryanodine or ruthenium red. Free SR vesicles were deficient in calsequestrin and were insensitive to these two agents. Localization of the cardiac and skeletal muscle high Mr proteins to the junctional SR, coupled with demonstration of their nearly identical biochemical properties, suggests that the proteins are homologous and are likely to have similar functions in both types of striated muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1985103299,"The keratin pattern of newborn mouse epidermis was investigated during terminal differentiation. In highly pure fractions of basal and suprabasal cells, obtained by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, we identified two sets of mRNA-encoded proteins: a basal set of 58.5, 52, and 47 kd subunits and a suprabasal set of 67 and 60 kd subunits. The large subunits of each set were alkaline to neutral, while the small subunits were acidic. Polyclonal antibodies against the suprabasal, acidic 60 kd protein and the basal, alkaline 58.5 kd protein selectively recognized their antigens in immunoblots of NEPHGE -resolved keratins and decorated the corresponding epidermal compartments in frozen sections. The antibody to the suprabasal 60 kd protein also recognized distinct cells in the basal cell layer. Quantification of this cell population revealed a 10% cell fraction, morphologically indistinguishable from the total cell population, that, in addition to expressing basal keratin proteins, was already synthesizing suprabasal keratin subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1485543100,"Incubation of freshly isolated rat hepatocytes with exogenous ATP, but not with succinate, resulted in intracellular Ca2+ accumulation which was partly prevented when the inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+ sequestration, ruthenium red, was also present in the medium. Although the bulk of the accumulated Ca2+ was sequestered by the mitochondria, formation of surface blebs and stimulation of phosphorylase alpha activity during incubation of the hepatocytes with ATP indicate that this treatment was also associated with an increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. When hepatocytes loaded with Ca2+ by preincubation with ATP were exposed to either 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone or t-butyl hydroperoxide, the cytotoxicity of both agents was markedly potentiated. Our results suggest that ATP-induced Ca2+ accumulation in hepatocytes is not due to contamination of the cell suspension with damaged cells or free intracellular organelles and that the intracellular Ca2+ concentration can affect the response to toxic agents."

https://openalex.org/W2145927611,"The large intervening sequences ( IVS2 ) of three human fetal globin genes contain tracts of alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences approximately 40-60 base pairs in length which adopt left-handed Z DNA helices under the influence of negative supercoiling. The amount of negative supercoiling (approximately 0.045) required for the right- to left-handed transitions is within the physiological range. The structural aberrations between the right- and left-handed helices were mapped by sequencing the S1 nuclease cleavage sites. Two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analyses of the supercoil-induced relaxation served to characterize the type and length of left-handed structure. Furthermore, binding studies with several types of antibodies confirmed the presence of left-handed helices. Since these simple sequences appear to be hotspots for recombination and gene conversion, unusual DNA conformations may participate in genetic expression."

https://openalex.org/W2068598778,"Molecular hybridization, monoclonal antibody, and electron microscopic analyses showed lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (strains Armstrong and WE) persistently infecting cells of the islets of Langerhans in BALB/WEHI mice. When monoclonal or monospecific antibody conjugated with two different fluorochrome dyes was used to mark insulin-containing beta cells or viral antigens, viral nucleoprotein was identified predominantly in beta cells. Electron microscopy confirmed these findings by showing virions budding from the beta cells. Persistent infection was associated with chemical evidence of diabetes (hyperglycemia, abnormal glucose tolerance, and normal or low-normal concentrations of insulin). Concentrations of cortisol and insulin-like growth factor in blood were normal, as was the level of growth hormone in the pituitary gland. The virus-infected islet cells showed normal anatomy and cytomorphology. Neither cell lysis nor inflammatory infiltrates were routinely seen. Thus a virus may persistently infect islet cells and provide a biochemical and morphological picture comparable to that of early adult-onset diabetes mellitus in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1973307878,"Treatment of exponentially growing Chinese hamster ovary cells with bleomycin causes a dose-dependent decrease in cell survival due to DNA damage. This lethal effect can be potentiated by the addition of a nonlethal dose of the anticalmodulin drug N-(4-aminobutyl)-5-chloro-2-naphthalenesulfonamide ( W13 ) but not its inactive analog N-(4-aminobutyl)-2-naphthalenesulfonamide ( W12 ). By preventing the repair of damaged DNA, W13 also inhibits recovery from potentially lethal damage induced by bleomycin. These data suggest a role for calmodulin in the DNA repair pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2040324704,"We have investigated contractile protein gene arrangement within the 88F subdivision of the Drosophila melanogaster third chromosome. We show that at least five antigenically related myofibrillar proteins, three of which accumulate only within indirect flight muscles, are encoded by a 20 kilobase chromosome segment located 140 kilobases proximal to the act88F actin gene. The chromosome segment includes two transcribed regions, each of which directs the synthesis of multiple mRNAs. RNA blot-hybridization experiments and DNA sequencing suggest that overlapping transcripts are generated by differential RNA splicing. The nucleotide sequence also establishes that two of the encoded proteins are tropomyosin isoforms, and two are related to tropomyosin. The arrangement of myofibrillar genes parallels the distribution of third chromosome mutations that disrupt indirect flight muscle formation."
https://openalex.org/W1923239373,"A human Lesch-Nyhan (hereditary, severe hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPR transferase) deficiency) B-lymphoblast line was infected with an amphotropic retroviral vector containing human HPR transferase cDNA under transcriptional control of viral long terminal repeat sequences. Of 17 clones isolated, 12 integration groups were defined by analysis of restriction enzyme digests of their genomic DNA with HPR transferase and viral long terminal repeat probes. These groups had HPR transferase activity restored to levels of 4 to 23% of normal values. Aberrant metabolic parameters associated with severe deficiency of HPR transferase activity, i.e. elevated rates of purine excretion, increased accumulation of hypoxanthine, elevated 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate contents, altered nucleoside triphosphate pools, resistance to toxic effects of 6-thioguanine, were partially to nearly completely corrected; the degree of correction generally corresponded to the degree of restoration of HPR transferase activity. The integration of the HPR transferase gene was found to be variably stable during 9 months of culture of the virally transformed lymphoblasts under nonselective conditions. The HPR transferase gene-infected lines reverted to resistance to 20 microM 6-thioguanine, i.e. severe HPR transferase deficiency, at frequencies of 10(-6) to in excess of 10(-5) per generation. The reversions were accompanied by either a loss or rearrangement of the integrated HPR transferase sequences or by retention of the sequences in an unaltered form."
https://openalex.org/W1979322315,"Growth hormone-releasing factors (GRF's) from two human pancreatic tumors (hpGRF's) that caused acromegaly and from the rat hypothalamus ( rhGRF ) were recently isolated and characterized. Although these peptides are potent growth hormone secretagogues, they have not until now been described to have actions outside the pituitary. These GRF's were shown to stimulate digestive enzyme secretion from an exocrine pancreatic preparation in vitro, rhGRF being more than 100 times as potent as hpGRF. Adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate mediates this action of the GRF's."
https://openalex.org/W1998610807,"Mutants of Sindbis virus were selected for rapid growth in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cell cultures and screened for attenuation of virulence in suckling mice. Comparisons among independently isolated virulent and attenuated strains, as well as a classical reversion analysis, showed that accelerated penetration of BHK cells was correlated with attenuation in vivo. Both phenotypic changes resulted from a reorganization of virion structure as detected by monoclonal antibodies. These results suggest that mutants selected for rapid growth in cell culture may be useful as attenuated vaccines and for studies of the molecular basis of virus pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1558908218,"The group C adenoviruses type 2 (Ad2) and type 5 (Ad5) are distinguished serologically by the antigenic determinants of the hexon and fiber capsomers . The hexon-coding region of the viral genome (map units 51.6-59.7) can be divided into three major zones with regard to DNA sequence homology between Ad2 and Ad5 on the basis of fine structure disclosed by restriction endonuclease site mapping ( Boursnell , M.E.G., and Mautner , V. (1981) Virology 112, 198-209). At the NH2-terminal end, there is almost complete restriction enzyme site homology between Ad2 and Ad5, the COOH terminus displays partial homology, and a central zone (map units 52.7-56.0) is heterologous and has no common restriction sites. We report here the DNA sequence of the Ad5 hexon gene (map units 51.6-59.7). This sequence is compared to that established for Ad2 (G. Akusj arvi , P. Alestr om, M. Pettersson , H. Jornvall , and U. Pettersson , manuscript submitted for publication), and the heterologous zone is shown to encode an amino acid sequence that differs from that of Ad2 at many different loci within the zone (map units 52.7-56.0), interspersed with short stretches of highly conserved sequence."
https://openalex.org/W73241344,"Interferon-treated mouse and human cells show enhanced levels of a protein kinase activity which is manifested by the phosphorylation of endogenous Mr = 67,000 and 72,000 proteins, respectively. Such kinase activity can be assayed after its partial purification on poly(I) X poly(C)-Sepharose. Under these experimental conditions, the apparent km of the kinase for ATP is 1.0 X 10(-6) M and 2.5 X 10(-6) M in enzyme fractions from mouse L-929 and human HeLa cells, respectively. The Mr = 67,000 and 72,000 proteins are phosphorylated by their serine and threonine residues, the ratio of which is modified in preparations from interferon-treated cells. Both of these phosphoproteins are composed of several subspecies with similar isoelectric points (pIs) in the range of 7.2 to 8.2. This heterogeneity is due to the number of phosphate groups per molecule of protein. Accordingly, the pIs of highly phosphorylated proteins are at a less basic pH (7.2 to 7.5). Furthermore, highly phosphorylated proteins show an increase in their apparent molecular weights compared to partially phosphorylated ones. This corresponds to an increase of Mr = 1,500. Partial proteolysis of the 32P-labeled Mr = 67,000 and 72,000 proteins by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, alpha-chymotrypsin and thrombin, indicated that these phosphoproteins differ in their polypeptide structure. Phosphorylation of the Mr = 67,000 and 72,000 proteins in enzyme fractions from control L-929 and HeLa cells is enhanced by mixing with extracts from interferon-treated heterologous cells. Proteins, Mr = 67,000 and 72,000, therefore, may serve as suitable substrates for an exogenous kinase, thus indicating that the substrate in enzyme fractions from control cells is less phosphorylated because of a low level of kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1491449266,"In order to study prolactin gene transcription and chromatin structure in a relatively homogeneous population of prolactin-producing cells, we induced lactotroph proliferation (pituitary tumor formation) in Fischer 344 rats by chronic diethylstibestrol treatment. We show that the prolactin gene is highly sensitive to digestion by DNase I in the chromatin of these pituitary tumors but not in liver. Furthermore, sequences immediately flanking the prolactin gene exhibit a similar high DNase I sensitivity. This contrasts with previous reports that the coding region of some genes is highly sensitive to DNase I digestion and that adjacent noncoding regions exhibit an intermediate sensitivity. This high level of DNase I sensitivity in the flanking regions was not due to transcription; we did not detect RNA transcripts homologous to any unique DNA sequence within 12 kilobase pairs upstream or downstream of the prolactin gene. We have identified two DNase I-hypersensitive sites 5' to the prolactin gene in pituitary tumors but none in liver. Also, the coding region, but not adjacent noncoding regions, of the prolactin gene domain is hypomethylated at MspI/HpaII and HhaI restriction enzyme sites in pituitary tumors. The prolactin gene domain is methylated at these sites in liver."
https://openalex.org/W1620219488,"Well characterized monospecific antisera against pepsin-extracted bovine type VI collagen were used to identify and characterize the intact form of type VI collagen. In immunoblotting experiments the antisera reacted with the pepsin-resistant fragments of the alpha 1(VI) and alpha 3(VI) chains, but not with the fragment of the alpha 2(VI) chain. Extracts obtained from uterus and aorta with 6 M guanidine HCl contained two immunoreactive polypeptides of Mr = 190,000 and 180,000 based on globular protein standards. Cleavage of extracts with pepsin generated the previously characterized pepsin-resistant fragments of alpha 1(VI) and alpha 3(VI), indicating that the higher molecular weight polypeptides represent the intact parent chains, alpha 1(VI) and alpha 3(VI). Digestion of extracts with bacterial collagenase released an Mr = 100,000 noncollagenous fragment from the alpha 1(VI) chain. Thus, intact type VI collagen in tissues contains a relatively short triple helical domain and at least one very large globular domain which is sensitive to pepsin but resistant to collagenase digestion. Immunoblotting revealed a polypeptide of Mr = 240,000, which we suggest represents the pro-alpha 1(VI) chain, in the culture medium of bovine fibroblasts. Bands intermediate in molecular weight between 240,000 and 190,000 were identified in cell layers. These findings establish type VI collagen as a protein with very large nontriple helical domains, a property that undoubtedly plays an important role in its function."
https://openalex.org/W1998355439,"The sequence of the envelope glycoprotein gene of type II human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV) is presented. The predicted amino acid sequence is similar to that of the corresponding protein of HTLV type I, in that the proteins share the same amino acids at 336 of 488 residues, and 68 of the 152 differences are of a conservative nature. The overall structural similarity of these proteins provides an explanation for the antigenic cross-reactivity observed among diverse members of the HTLV retrovirus family by procedures that assay for the viral envelope glycoprotein, for example, membrane immunofluorescence."

https://openalex.org/W2069765957,"As commonly understood, the myelin sheath of axons insulates the internodal axolemma and essentially restricts transmembrane currents to nodal regions. However, recordings obtained from within the myelin sheath showed that its apparent resistance to current generated by action potentials is similar in magnitude to that of the internodal axolemma. This suggests that the sheath does not appreciably limit transmembrane current flow, presumably because there is a longitudinal shunt under the myelin and through the paranodal region. Thus, in some demyelinating diseases and other axonopathies, the safety factor for impulse conduction may be lowered by a loosening or a reduction in the number of paranodal axoglial junctions."
https://openalex.org/W1485782671,"The expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) antigenic determinants in the delipidated and solubilized apolipoprotein B (apo-B) free of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) has been studied. Of the six distinct determinants which react with previously characterized monoclonal antibodies against LDL (Milne, R.W., Theolis , R., Jr., Verdery , R.B., and Marcel , Y.L. (1983) Arteriosclerosis 3, 23-30), only one, that recognized by antibody 1D1 , was expressed on the soluble apo-B, indicating that soluble apo-B may be partly denatured. The average immunoreactivity of apo-B with antibody 1D1 was similar to or lower than that of intact LDL (mean 36%, range 93-20%). Therefore, delipidation and solubilization did not expose on apo-B any additional site reactive with 1D1 . When apo-B was equilibrated with either SDS micelles or with cholesterol-lecithin liposomes, the immunoreactivity of the determinant recognized by antibody 2D8 was partially regenerated, but not that of the others. In contrast, incubation of apo-B with microemulsions containing a hydrophobic core of cholesteryl esters also restored the antigenicity of the determinants reacting with antibodies 3F5 , 4G3 , and 5E11 . However, the regeneration of these antigenic determinants could only be achieved when solubilized apo-B was treated with SDS prior to equilibration with microemulsion preparations. In conclusion, three types of antigenic determinants have been identified on apo-B. The first type, such as that recognized by antibody 1D1 , is expressed both on LDL and on apo-B and is constituted by the primary and secondary structure of apo-B. The second type, an example being that recognized by 2D8 , is a conformational determinant which requires the presence of amphipathic lipids such as lecithin and cholesterol or SDS micelles. The third type, which reacts with antibodies 3F5 , 4G3 , and 5E11 , represents different conformational determinants which require the association of apo-B with lipid structures having a cholesteryl ester hydrophobic core. It may be significant that the latter determinants are those close to the LDL receptor-binding site on apo-B and that this domain of apo-B has a complex tertiary and quaternary structure as evidenced by the conformational requirements of the antigenic determinants."
https://openalex.org/W1588444364,"Insulin antagonized the glycogenolytic actions of cAMP in isolated hepatocytes even in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine or d-4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2- imidizolidione . Stimulation of glucose release by 8-bromo-cAMP, which is not appreciably hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterase, was also inhibited by insulin in the presence of d-4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2- imidizolidione . This demonstrates that insulin can antagonize cAMP stimulation of glycogenolysis independent of possible effects of insulin on adenylate cyclase or phosphodiesterase. Under conditions where changes in cyclic adenine nucleotide concentrations (cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP) were prevented, insulin depressed the 8-bromo-cAMP-stimulated protein kinase activity ratio. We conclude that phosphodiesterase activation is not required for insulin antagonism of cAMP-stimulated glycogenolysis. The effect of insulin under these conditions can be explained by an action of insulin on cAMP-dependent protein kinase independent of changes in cAMP levels."
https://openalex.org/W1603649726,"The inhibition of activated human Factor X by human plasma protease inhibitors was investigated in both purified and plasma systems. In the former, antithrombin III, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, and alpha 2-macroglobulin, at normal plasma concentrations, markedly inhibited activated Factor X. Significant inhibition by alpha 2-antiplasmin, however, was only achieved when present at 40 times its plasma concentration. The relative rates of inhibition of activated Factor X coagulant activity in normal human plasma, antithrombin III-deficient plasma, and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor-deficient plasma were 1.0, 0.63, and 0.75, respectively. From these relative rates of inhibition and their measured concentrations in the 3 plasmas, it was calculated that antithrombin III, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, and alpha 2-macroglobulin contribute 53, 35, and 12%, respectively, to the inhibition of activated Factor X in normal human plasma. Using 125I-labeled activated Factor X and a combination of sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis and immunoadsorption, it was then demonstrated that antithrombin III accounted for 45-55%, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, 35-40%, and alpha 2-macroglobulin, 10-15% of the inhibition of the labeled protease in normal human plasma. The values obtained with the deficient plasmas are consistent with the distribution of activated Factor X-inhibitor complexes in normal human plasma. These data show by two independent techniques, one measuring coagulant activity and the other 125I-labeled activated Factor X-inhibitor complexes, that both antithrombin III and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor are the major inhibitors of activated Factor X in normal human plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1539992648,"Chemical deglycosylation of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) produced an antagonist (DG-hCG) that specifically bound to hCG receptors but was no longer able to stimulate adenylate cyclase in the murine Leydig tumor cell line, MLTC-1. DG-hCG was restored to an agonist by incubating cells or membranes having the bound analogue with antibodies against hCG (anti-hCG). In the presence of anti-hCG, cyclic AMP accumulation and adenylate cyclase activity were stimulated over DG-hCG alone. There was no accumulation of cyclic AMP when the cells were exposed to anti-hCG alone or DG-hCG and normal serum or anti-hCG first then DG-hCG. Several different batches of anti-hCG were effective but their activity did not correlate with their affinity for DG-hCG or hCG. The effect of anti-hCG on DG-hCG activity was dose- and time-dependent. Maximal stimulation of cyclic AMP was achieved with antisera dilutions of 1:200 or less. When DG-hCG-treated cells were exposed to anti-hCG at 37 degrees C, there was a 10-min lag. The lag was eliminated when the cells were exposed to the antibodies at 4 degrees C for 3 h and then warmed to 37 degrees C. Adenylate cyclase was also activated when Fab fragments prepared by papain digestion of anti-hCG were used, whereas Fc fragments were not effective. Thus, the divalency of the anti-hCG is not the critical factor in the mechanism of antibody action. Our results suggest that anti-hCG converts DG-hCG from an antagonist to an agonist possibly by altering the conformation of the modified hormone."
https://openalex.org/W106705301,"Several structural analogs of 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (4-MHA) that had been established as substrates of the 4-MHA-activating enzyme from Streptomyces chrysomallus (Keller, U., Kleinkauf, H., and Zocher, R. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 1479-1484) were fed in short term labeling experiments to cultures of two actinomycin-producing streptomycetes. Besides inhibition of actinomycin synthesis, the addition of 4-methyl-3-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid, or 4-methyl-3-methoxy-benzoic acid induced the formation of novel compounds. The data indicate that these compounds are structural analogs of 4-MHA pentapeptide lactones, which are the most probable precursors of actinomycins (Katz, E. (1967) in Antibiotics II (Gottlieb, D., and Shaw, P. D., eds) pp. 276-341, Springer-Verlag, New York). Since the structural analogs of 4-MHA are missing the o-aminophenol configuration, the corresponding acyl pentapeptide lactones cannot react with each other to give phenoxazines. Therefore, they accumulate and thus become detectable. Feeding cultures with 4-MHA resulted in an inhibition of actinomycin synthesis apparently at the level of acyl pentapeptide lactone synthesis. In such experiments, the formation of pentapeptide lactones, which are most likely derived from 4-MHA pentapeptide lactones, could be detected. The results provide experimental evidence that the biosynthesis of actinomycins proceeds via the 4-MHA-pentapeptide lactones."
https://openalex.org/W1539626872,"Isolated heart mitochondria retain matrix K+ in a K+-free medium and exchange matrix 42K+ with external K+ only slowly. This low permeability to K+ is maintained when the proton motive force is dissipated by addition of an uncoupler, but can be increased markedly in uncoupled mitochondria when (a) NADPH becomes oxidized and (b) a Ca2+ chelator or ruthenium red is added (Jung, D. W., and Brierley , G. P. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10490-10496). This latter requirement suggests that decreased Ca2+ binding or alteration of the Ca2+ uniporter may be involved in the induction of permeability to K+ in these mitochondria. The present studies establish that La3+ (k0.5 = 1.8 nmol X mg-1 of protein) also induces K+ permeability in uncoupled mitochondria in which NADPH has been oxidized. The amount of net K+ loss or passive 42K+/K+ exchange induced by La3+ corresponds to that produced by ruthenium red or EGTA and appears to vary from preparation to preparation as a function of the endogenous adenine nucleotide (AN) content of the mitochondria. The permeability to K+ induced by all three reagents is increased by depletion of endogenous AN with PPi and strongly inhibited by low levels of exogenous AN. The optimum passive permeability to K+ develops at pH 7.5, is inhibited by Nupercaine , quinine, and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and is increased in a sucrose, as opposed to a KCl medium. The increased permeability to K+ appears to result from the opening of one or more K+-conducting uniport pathways, rather than K+/H+ exchange. Since Ca2+ efflux remains sensitive to ruthenium red when K+ efflux is induced, it seems unlikely that the Ca2+ uniporter itself can provide a pathway for K+ flux. The presence of such latent pathways for passive K+ permeability must be considered when defining the properties of the putative K+/H+ antiporter and during isolation and reconstitution protocols involving mitochondrial K+ transport components."
https://openalex.org/W2091147596,Lines of KB cells resistant to cytochalasin B have been isolated and characterized. The mutant Cyt 1 exhibits increased cross-resistance to cytochalasin E. Cyt 1 cells bind less cytochalasin B than parental KB cells. Two-dimensional gel analysis shows that Cyt 1 cells carry an alteration in β-actin. This is further confirmed by one-dimensional peptide analysis. The altered β-actin (β′-actin) is synthesized when poly(A)+ RNA from Cyt 1 cells is translated in a reticulocyte-cell-free translation system. These results suggest that the primary site of action of cytochalasin B on cellular motility processes is β-actin.

https://openalex.org/W1593648350,"Genomic DNA fragments containing sequences homologous to 5 S rRNA have been isolated from humans and mice. When transcribed in a cell-free system (S100) derived from human HeLa cells, these cloned fragments show qualitative and quantitative differences with respect to 5 S rRNA synthesis and with respect to the synthesis of larger RNA polymerase III transcripts in the 300-600-nucleotide range. One mouse and one human clone have been characterized in detail. The clone containing the mouse 5 S gene is active in an in vitro transcription system and generates a 5 S transcript which differs in five RNase T1 oligonucleotides from mouse 5 S rRNA. In contrast, the clone containing the human 5 S gene is transcriptionally inactive for a 5 S-sized RNA product in vitro. Both clones serve as active templates for multiple RNA transcripts which share sequence homology with the human Alu family. These transcripts, as well as cloned Alu sequences used as hybridization probes, map to sites within close proximity of the 5 S gene in both the mouse and human clones. These functionally heterogeneous 5 S genes are arranged in a manner similar to the bulk of 5 S rRNA genes within their respective genomes and may be interspersed among them. The repeat lengths for DNA fragments containing these genes are considerably longer (2.8 and 6 kilobases) than observed for 5 S genes in other organisms and may indicate that larger repeat units are a characteristic feature of mammalian 5 S genes."
https://openalex.org/W1523133029,"Formycin B is cytotoxic toward Leishmania and is a potential chemotherapeutic agent for leishmaniasis. In order to determine the mechanism of action of formycin B, we have isolated and characterized clonal populations of formycin B-resistant Leishmania donovani. These formycin B-resistant clones are also cross-resistant to formycin A and allopurinol riboside-mediated growth inhibition. Incubation of the formycin B-resistant cells with [3H]formycin B indicates that, unlike wild type cells, the resistant populations cannot accumulate phosphorylated metabolites of exogenous [3H]formycin B. This is due to a defective transport system for formycin B in the resistant cells. However, wild type and mutant cells incorporate [3H]formycin A equally efficiently into [3H]formycin A-containing nucleotides and into RNA. These data suggest that formycin B cytotoxicity in Leishmania is not mediated by its incorporation as the adenosine analog into RNA. A plausible alternative hypothesis is proposed for the mechanism of action of the pyrazolo (4,3-d)pyrimidine C-nucleosides based upon depletion of an essential intracellular metabolite."
https://openalex.org/W1510722505,"The composite result from three different methods predicts that alpha 2-macroglobulin has a predominant pattern of alternating beta-strands and turns. Only scattered pieces of alpha-helix are present throughout its sequence. Predicted beta-strands constitute 43.8% and helices 8.6%, in fair agreement with circular dichroism spectra. Circular dichroism spectra and sequence data suggest that the tertiary structure of complement component C3b is similar to that of the alpha 2 macroglobulin monomer. At present, the beta-barrel configuration of prealbumin seems to be a better model than those of soybean trypsin inhibitor, serine proteases, and immunoglobulins. A repetitive pattern of disulfide loops could indicate structural units of about 200 residues in size, but this is not supported by amino acid sequence homology. The hydropathic pattern of the sequence reveals numerous examples of predicted immunogenic peptides and detects an approximately 100-residue hydrophobic core region, which could constitute parts of the tentatively assigned consecutive activation cleavage and thiol ester domains. This core is an obvious candidate of rearrangement transfer between the highly exposed bait region and the partly shielded thiol ester site. The presumed intersubunit half-cystine is moderately buried and has two nearby patches of high charge density which could guide the dimeric assembling."

https://openalex.org/W1492586271,"We have characterized the polypeptides translated in vitro by mRNAs of early region 1 (E1) of human adenovirus (Ad) type 2. Poly (A+) polyribosomal RNA was isolated from early Ad2-infected cells, the viral specific mRNAs were selected by hybridization to Ad2 E1a and E1b DNA, and the mRNAs were translated in vitro using [35S]methionine as a labeled precursor with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. E1a-selected mRNA was translated to the 45-58-kDa cluster of polypeptides. We show here that E1b-selected mRNA can also be translated to the 45-58-kDa cluster of polypeptides in addition to the major 19-kDa polypeptide. The E1b 58-kDa polypeptide was produced only at a low level unless E1b mRNA is fractionated before translation to enrich for the 58-kDa mRNA. Translation of E1b region-selected mRNAs that have been fractionated by size shows that the 22 S mRNA fraction is translated to at least the 53-58-kDa E1a-related polypeptides as well as to E1b 58- and 19-kDa polypeptides. Our experiments suggest that the 22 S mRNA fraction includes E1a-E1b overlapping mRNA which was translated to E1a-related polypeptides as well as E1b 22 S mRNA. When compared by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by tryptic peptide mapping, the cluster of polypeptides translated from E1a-selected mRNA and the cluster translated from E1b-selected mRNA were distinguishable. A possible explanation for this is discussed, based upon splicing sites of the E1a-E1b overlapping mRNA which would result in an amino acid sequence with a COOH-terminal end slightly different from that of E1a polypeptides."
