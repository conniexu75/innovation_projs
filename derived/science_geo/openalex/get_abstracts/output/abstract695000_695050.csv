https://openalex.org/W4282936228,"INTRODUCTION The eukaryotic nucleus pro-tects the genome and is enclosed by the two membranes of the nuclear envelope. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) perforate the nuclear envelope to facilitate nucleocytoplasmic transport. With a molecular weight of ∼120 MDa, the human NPC is one of the larg-est protein complexes. Its ~1000 proteins are taken in multiple copies from a set of about 30 distinct nucleoporins (NUPs). They can be roughly categorized into two classes. Scaf-fold NUPs contain folded domains and form a cylindrical scaffold architecture around a central channel. Intrinsically disordered NUPs line the scaffold and extend into the central channel, where they interact with cargo complexes. The NPC architecture is highly dynamic. It responds to changes in nuclear envelope tension with conforma-tional breathing that manifests in dilation and constriction movements. Elucidating the scaffold architecture, ultimately at atomic resolution, will be important for gaining a more precise understanding of NPC function and dynamics but imposes a substantial chal-lenge for structural biologists. RATIONALE Considerable progress has been made toward this goal by a joint effort in the field. A synergistic combination of complementary approaches has turned out to be critical. In situ structural biology techniques were used to reveal the overall layout of the NPC scaffold that defines the spatial reference for molecular modeling. High-resolution structures of many NUPs were determined in vitro. Proteomic analysis and extensive biochemical work unraveled the interaction network of NUPs. Integra-tive modeling has been used to combine the different types of data, resulting in a rough outline of the NPC scaffold. Previous struc-tural models of the human NPC, however, were patchy and limited in accuracy owing to several challenges: (i) Many of the high-resolution structures of individual NUPs have been solved from distantly related species and, consequently, do not comprehensively cover their human counterparts. (ii) The scaf-fold is interconnected by a set of intrinsically disordered linker NUPs that are not straight-forwardly accessible to common structural biology techniques. (iii) The NPC scaffold intimately embraces the fused inner and outer nuclear membranes in a distinctive topol-ogy and cannot be studied in isolation. (iv) The conformational dynamics of scaffold NUPs limits the resolution achievable in structure determination. RESULTS In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction to generate an exten-sive repertoire of structural models of human NUPs and their subcomplexes. The resulting models cover various domains and interfaces that so far remained structurally uncharac-terized. Benchmarking against previous and unpublished x-ray and cryo-electron micros-copy structures revealed unprecedented accu-racy. We obtained well-resolved cryo-electron tomographic maps of both the constricted and dilated conformational states of the hu-man NPC. Using integrative modeling, we fit-ted the structural models of individual NUPs into the cryo-electron microscopy maps. We explicitly included several linker NUPs and traced their trajectory through the NPC scaf-fold. We elucidated in great detail how mem-brane-associated and transmembrane NUPs are distributed across the fusion topology of both nuclear membranes. The resulting architectural model increases the structural coverage of the human NPC scaffold by about twofold. We extensively validated our model against both earlier and new experimental data. The completeness of our model has enabled microsecond-long coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the NPC scaffold within an explicit membrane en-vironment and solvent. These simulations reveal that the NPC scaffold prevents the constriction of the otherwise stable double-membrane fusion pore to small diameters in the absence of membrane tension. CONCLUSION Our 70-MDa atomically re-solved model covers >90% of the human NPC scaffold. It captures conforma-tional changes that occur during dilation and constriction. It also reveals the precise anchoring sites for intrinsically disordered NUPs, the identification of which is a prerequisite for a complete and dy-namic model of the NPC. Our study exempli-fies how AI-based structure prediction may accelerate the elucidation of subcellular ar-chitecture at atomic resolution. [Figure: see text]."

An experiment that processes quantum data with a quantum computer could have substantial advantages over conventional experiments in which quantum states are measured and outcomes are processed with a classical computer. We proved that quantum machines could learn from exponentially fewer experiments than the number required by conventional experiments. This exponential advantage is shown for predicting properties of physical systems, performing quantum principal component analysis, and learning about physical dynamics. Furthermore, the quantum resources needed for achieving an exponential advantage are quite modest in some cases. Conducting experiments with 40 superconducting qubits and 1300 quantum gates, we demonstrated that a substantial quantum advantage is possible with today's quantum processors."
https://openalex.org/W4282918855,"INTRODUCTION The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the molecular conduit in the nuclear membrane of eukaryotic cells that regulates import and export of biomolecules between the nucleus and the cytosol, with vertebrate NPCs ~110 to 125 MDa in molecular mass and ~120 nm in diameter. NPCs are organized into four main rings: the cytoplasmic ring (CR) at the cytosolic side, the inner ring and the luminal ring on the plane of the nuclear membrane, and the nuclear ring facing the nucleus. Each ring possesses an approximate eightfold symmetry and is composed of multiple copies of different nucleoporins. NPCs have been implicated in numerous biological processes, and their dysfunctions are associated with a growing number of serious human diseases. However, despite pioneering studies from many groups over the past two decades, we still lack a full understanding of NPCs’ organization, dynamics, and complexity. RATIONALE We used the Xenopus laevis oocyte as a model system for the structural characterization because each oocyte possesses a large number of NPC particles that can be visualized on native nuclear membranes without the aid of detergent extraction. We used single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis on data collected at different stage tilt angles for three-dimensional reconstruction and structure prediction with AlphaFold for model building. RESULTS We reconstructed the CR map of X. laevis NPC at 6.9 and 6.7 Å resolutions for the full CR protomer and a core region, respectively, and predicted the structures of the individual nucleoporins using AlphaFold because no high-resolution models of X. laevis Nups were available. For any ambiguous subunit interactions, we also predicted complex structures, which further guided model fitting of the CR protomer. We placed the nucleoporin or complex structures into the CR density to obtain an almost full CR atomic model, composed of the inner and outer Y-complexes, two copies of Nup205, two copies of the Nup214-Nup88-Nup62 complex, one Nup155, and five copies of Nup358. In particular, we predicted the largest protein in the NPC, Nup358, as having an S-shaped globular domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a largely disordered C-terminal region containing phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats previously shown to form a gel-like condensate phase for selective cargo passage. Four of the Nup358 copies clamp around the inner and outer Y-complexes to stabilize the CR, and the fifth Nup358 situates in the center of the cluster of clamps. AlphaFold also predicted a homo-oligomeric, likely specifically pentameric, coiled-coil structure of Nup358 that may provide the avidity for Nup358 recruitment to the NPC and for lowering the threshold for Nup358 condensation in NPC biogenesis. CONCLUSION Our studies offer an example of integrative cryo-EM and structure prediction as a general approach for attaining more precise models of megadalton protein complexes from medium-resolution density maps. The more accurate and almost complete model of the CR presented here expands our understanding of the molecular interactions in the NPC and represents a substantial step forward toward the molecular architecture of a full NPC, with implications for NPC function, biogenesis, and regulation.

The 6.9 Å map was generated with single-particle cryo-EM, and the model was built with AlphaFold structure prediction.

The approach allowed the identification of five copies of Nup358 and a second copy of the trimeric Nup214-Nup88-Nup62 complex."
https://openalex.org/W4282925643,"INTRODUCTION The subcellular compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells requires selective transport of folded proteins and protein–nucleic acid complexes. Embedded in nuclear envelope pores, which are generated by the circumscribed fusion of the inner and outer nuclear membranes, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are the sole bidirectional gateways for nucleocytoplasmic transport. The ~110-MDa human NPC is an ~1000-protein assembly that comprises multiple copies of ~34 different proteins, collectively termed nucleoporins. The symmetric core of the NPC is composed of an inner ring encircling the central transport channel and outer rings formed by Y‑shaped coat nucleoporin complexes (CNCs) anchored atop both sides of the nuclear envelope. The outer rings are decorated with compartment‑specific asymmetric nuclear basket and cytoplasmic filament nucleoporins, which establish transport directionality and provide docking sites for transport factors and the small guanosine triphosphatase Ran. The cytoplasmic filament nucleoporins also play an essential role in the irreversible remodeling of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) as they exit the central transport channel. Unsurprisingly, the NPC’s cytoplasmic face represents a hotspot for disease‑associated mutations and is commonly targeted by viral virulence factors. RATIONALE Previous studies established a near-atomic composite structure of the human NPC’s symmetric core by combining (i) biochemical reconstitution to elucidate the interaction network between symmetric nucleoporins, (ii) crystal and single-particle cryo–electron microscopy structure determination of nucleoporins and nucleoporin complexes to reveal their three-dimensional shape and the molecular details of their interactions, (iii) quantitative docking in cryo–electron tomography (cryo-ET) maps of the intact human NPC to uncover nucleoporin stoichiometry and positioning, and (iv) cell‑based assays to validate the physiological relevance of the biochemical and structural findings. In this work, we extended our approach to the cytoplasmic filament nucleoporins to reveal the near-atomic architecture of the cytoplasmic face of the human NPC. RESULTS Using biochemical reconstitution, we elucidated the protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction networks of the human and Chaetomium thermophilum cytoplasmic filament nucleoporins, establishing an evolutionarily conserved heterohexameric cytoplasmic filament nucleoporin complex (CFNC) held together by a central heterotrimeric coiled‑coil hub that tethers two separate mRNP‑remodeling complexes. Further biochemical analysis and determination of a series of crystal structures revealed that the metazoan‑specific cytoplasmic filament nucleoporin NUP358 is composed of 16 distinct domains, including an N‑terminal S‑shaped α‑helical solenoid followed by a coiled‑coil oligomerization element, numerous Ran‑interacting domains, an E3 ligase domain, and a C‑terminal prolyl‑isomerase domain. Physiologically validated quantitative docking into cryo-ET maps of the intact human NPC revealed that pentameric NUP358 bundles, conjoined by the oligomerization element, are anchored through their N‑terminal domains to the central stalk regions of the CNC, projecting flexibly attached domains as far as ~600 Å into the cytoplasm. Using cell‑based assays, we demonstrated that NUP358 is dispensable for the architectural integrity of the assembled interphase NPC and RNA export but is required for efficient translation. After NUP358 assignment, the remaining 4-shaped cryo‑ET density matched the dimensions of the CFNC coiled‑coil hub, in close proximity to an outer-ring NUP93. Whereas the N-terminal NUP93 assembly sensor motif anchors the properly assembled related coiled‑coil channel nucleoporin heterotrimer to the inner ring, biochemical reconstitution confirmed that the NUP93 assembly sensor is reused in anchoring the CFNC to the cytoplasmic face of the human NPC. By contrast, two C. thermophilum CFNCs are anchored by a divergent mechanism that involves assembly sensors located in unstructured portions of two CNC nucleoporins. Whereas unassigned cryo‑ET density occupies the NUP358 and CFNC binding sites on the nuclear face, docking of the nuclear basket component ELYS established that the equivalent position on the cytoplasmic face is unoccupied, suggesting that mechanisms other than steric competition promote asymmetric distribution of nucleoporins. CONCLUSION We have substantially advanced the biochemical and structural characterization of the asymmetric nucleoporins’ architecture and attachment at the cytoplasmic and nuclear faces of the NPC. Our near‑atomic composite structure of the human NPC’s cytoplasmic face provides a biochemical and structural framework for elucidating the molecular basis of mRNP remodeling, viral virulence factor interference with NPC function, and the underlying mechanisms of nucleoporin diseases at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC.

Here, we study the emission of light from a radiation source inside a PTC. We solve the general classical and quantum mechanical models of emission in a temporally-varying medium, and find that radiation is always exponentially amplified when associated with the momentum gap, whether initiated by a macroscopic source, an atom, or by vacuum fluctuations, drawing the amplification energy from the modulation. The radiation linewidth becomes narrower as time advances, and is centered in the middle of the momentum gap. We calculate the spontaneous decay rate of an atom embedded in a PTC and show that it vanishes at the band edge due to low density of photonic states. Finally, we propose the concept of nonresonant tunable PTC lasers."

https://openalex.org/W4281677038,"INTRODUCTION In eukaryotic cells, the selective bidirectional transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm occurs through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Embedded in nuclear envelope pores, the ~110-MDa human NPC is an ~1200-Å-wide and ~750-Å-tall assembly of ~1000 proteins, collectively termed nucleoporins. Because of the NPC’s eightfold rotational symmetry along the nucleocytoplasmic axis, each of the ~34 different nucleoporins occurs in multiples of eight. Architecturally, the NPC’s symmetric core is composed of an inner ring encircling the central transport channel and two outer rings anchored on both sides of the nuclear envelope. Because of its central role in the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein, the NPC is commonly targeted in viral infections and its nucleoporin constituents are associated with a plethora of diseases. RATIONALE Although the arrangement of most scaffold nucleoporins in the NPC’s symmetric core was determined by quantitative docking of crystal structures into cryo–electron tomographic (cryo-ET) maps of intact NPCs, the topology and molecular details of their cohesion by multivalent linker nucleoporins have remained elusive. Recently, in situ cryo-ET reconstructions of NPCs from various species have indicated that the NPC’s inner ring is capable of reversible constriction and dilation in response to variations in nuclear envelope membrane tension, thereby modulating the diameter of the central transport channel by ~200 Å. We combined biochemical reconstitution, high-resolution crystal and single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure determination, docking into cryo-ET maps, and physiological validation to elucidate the molecular architecture of the linker-scaffold interaction network that not only is essential for the NPC’s integrity but also confers the plasticity and robustness necessary to allow and withstand such large-scale conformational changes. RESULTS By biochemically mapping scaffold-binding regions of all fungal and human linker nucleoporins and determining crystal and single-particle cryo-EM structures of linker-scaffold complexes, we completed the characterization of the biochemically tractable linker-scaffold network and established its evolutionary conservation, despite considerable sequence divergence. We determined a series of crystal and single-particle cryo-EM structures of the intact Nup188 and Nup192 scaffold hubs bound to their Nic96, Nup145N, and Nup53 linker nucleoporin binding regions, revealing that both proteins form distinct question mark–shaped keystones of two evolutionarily conserved hetero‑octameric inner ring complexes. Linkers bind to scaffold surface pockets through short defined motifs, with flanking regions commonly forming additional disperse interactions that reinforce the binding. Using a structure‑guided functional analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , we confirmed the robustness of linker‑scaffold interactions and established the physiological relevance of our biochemical and structural findings. The near-atomic composite structures resulting from quantitative docking of experimental structures into human and S. cerevisiae cryo-ET maps of constricted and dilated NPCs structurally disambiguated the positioning of the Nup188 and Nup192 hubs in the intact fungal and human NPC and revealed the topology of the linker-scaffold network. The linker-scaffold gives rise to eight relatively rigid inner ring spokes that are flexibly interconnected to allow for the formation of lateral channels. Unexpectedly, we uncovered that linker‑scaffold interactions play an opposing role in the outer rings by forming tight cross-link staples between the eight nuclear and cytoplasmic outer ring spokes, thereby limiting the dilatory movements to the inner ring. CONCLUSION We have substantially advanced the structural and biochemical characterization of the symmetric core of the S. cerevisiae and human NPCs and determined near-atomic composite structures. The composite structures uncover the molecular mechanism by which the evolutionarily conserved linker‑scaffold establishes the NPC’s integrity while simultaneously allowing for the observed plasticity of the central transport channel. The composite structures are roadmaps for the mechanistic dissection of NPC assembly and disassembly, the etiology of NPC‑associated diseases, the role of NPC dilation in nucleocytoplasmic transport of soluble and integral membrane protein cargos, and the anchoring of asymmetric nucleoporins.

https://openalex.org/W4281913203,"Mechanical force controls fundamental cellular processes in health and disease, and increasing evidence shows that the nucleus both experiences and senses applied forces. Such forces can lead to the nuclear translocation of proteins, but whether force controls nucleocytoplasmic transport, and how, remains unknown. Here we show that nuclear forces differentially control passive and facilitated nucleocytoplasmic transport, setting the rules for the mechanosensitivity of shuttling proteins. We demonstrate that nuclear force increases permeability across nuclear pore complexes, with a dependence on molecular weight that is stronger for passive than for facilitated diffusion. Owing to this differential effect, force leads to the translocation of cargoes into or out of the nucleus within a given range of molecular weight and affinity for nuclear transport receptors. Further, we show that the mechanosensitivity of several transcriptional regulators can be both explained by this mechanism and engineered exogenously by introducing appropriate nuclear localization signals. Our work unveils a mechanism of mechanically induced signalling, probably operating in parallel with others, with potential applicability across signalling pathways."

Our analyses revealed four ecological zones, latitudinal and depth diversity patterns, and environmental correlates for RNA viruses. Our findings only partially parallel those of cosampled plankton and show unexpectedly high polar ecological interactions. The influence of RNA viruses on ecosystems appears to be large, as predicted hosts are ecologically important. Moreover, the occurrence of auxiliary metabolic genes indicates that RNA viruses cause reprogramming of diverse host metabolisms, including photosynthesis and carbon cycling, and that RNA virus abundances predict ocean carbon export."

Although discrete time crystals have been extensively studied in periodically driven systems, the experimental realization of a continuous time crystal is still pending. We report the observation of a limit cycle phase in a continuously pumped dissipative atom-cavity system that is characterized by emergent oscillations in the intracavity photon number. The phase of the oscillation was found to be random for different realizations, and hence, this dynamical many-body state breaks continuous time translation symmetry spontaneously. Furthermore, the observed limit cycles are robust against temporal perturbations and therefore demonstrate the realization of a continuous time crystal."
https://openalex.org/W4281726159,"INTRODUCTION The nuclear pore complex (NPC) resides on the nuclear envelope (NE) and mediates nucleocytoplasmic cargo transport. As one of the largest cellular machineries, a vertebrate NPC consists of cytoplasmic filaments, a cytoplasmic ring (CR), an inner ring, a nuclear ring, a nuclear basket, and a luminal ring. Each NPC has eight repeating subunits. Structure determination of NPC is a prerequisite for understanding its functional mechanism. In the past two decades, integrative modeling, which combines x-ray structures of individual nucleoporins and subcomplexes with cryo–electron tomography reconstructions, has played a crucial role in advancing our knowledge about the NPC. The CR has been a major focus of structural investigation. The CR subunit of human NPC was reconstructed by cryo–electron tomography through subtomogram averaging to an overall resolution of ~20 Å, with local resolution up to ~15 Å. Each CR subunit comprises two Y-shaped multicomponent complexes known as the inner and outer Y complexes. Eight inner and eight outer Y complexes assemble in a head-to-tail fashion to form the proximal and distal rings, respectively, constituting the CR scaffold. To achieve higher resolution of the CR, we used single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to image the intact NPC from the NE of Xenopus laevis oocytes. Reconstructions of the core region and the Nup358 region of the X. laevis CR subunit had been achieved at average resolutions of 5 to 8 Å, allowing identification of secondary structural elements. RATIONALE Packing interactions among the components of the CR subunit were poorly defined by all previous EM maps. Additional components of the CR subunit are strongly suggested by the EM maps of 5- to 8-Å resolution but remain to be identified. Addressing these issues requires improved resolution of the cryo-EM reconstruction. Therefore, we may need to enhance sample preparation, optimize image acquisition, and develop an effective data-processing strategy. RESULTS To reduce conformational heterogeneity of the sample, we spread the opened NE onto the grids with minimal force and used the chemical cross-linker glutaraldehyde to stabilize the NPC. To alleviate orientation bias of the NPC, we tilted sample grids and imaged the sample with higher electron dose at higher angles. We improved the image-processing protocol. With these efforts, the average resolutions for the core and the Nup358 regions have been improved to 3.7 and 4.7 Å, respectively. The highest local resolution of the core region reaches 3.3 Å. In addition, a cryo-EM structure of the N-terminal α-helical domain of Nup358 has been resolved at 3.0-Å resolution. These EM maps allow the identification of five copies of Nup358, two copies of Nup93, two copies of Nup205, and two copies of Y complexes in each CR subunit. Relying on the EM maps and facilitated by AlphaFold prediction, we have generated a final model for the CR of the X. laevis NPC. Our model of the CR subunit includes 19,037 amino acids in 30 nucleoporins. A previously unknown C-terminal fragment of Nup160 was found to constitute a key part of the vertex, in which the short arm, long arm, and stem of the Y complex meet. The Nup160 C-terminal fragment directly binds the β-propeller proteins Seh1 and Sec13. Two Nup205 molecules, which do not contact each other, bind the inner and outer Y complexes through distinct interfaces. Conformational elasticity of the two Nup205 molecules may underlie their versatility in binding to different nucleoporins in the proximal and distal CR rings. Two Nup93 molecules, each comprising an N-terminal extended helix and an ACE1 domain, bridge the Y complexes and Nup205. Nup93 and Nup205 together play a critical role in mediating the contacts between neighboring CR subunits. Five Nup358 molecules, each in the shape of a shrimp tail and named “the clamp,” hold the stems of both Y complexes. The innate conformational elasticity allows each Nup358 clamp to adapt to a distinct local environment for optimal interactions with neighboring nucleoporins. In each CR subunit, the α-helical nucleoporins appear to provide the conformational elasticity; the 12 β-propellers may strengthen the scaffold. CONCLUSION Our EM map–based model of the X. laevis CR subunit substantially expands the molecular mass over the reported composite models of vertebrate CR subunit. In addition to the Y complexes, five Nup358, two Nup205, and two Nup93 molecules constitute the key components of the CR. The improved EM maps reveal insights into the interfaces among the nucleoporins of the CR. Cryo-EM structure of the double-layered CR of the X. laevis NPC.

https://openalex.org/W4281917178,"Effects estimated by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) include effects of alleles in an individual on that individual (direct genetic effects), indirect genetic effects (for example, effects of alleles in parents on offspring through the environment) and bias from confounding. Within-family genetic variation is random, enabling unbiased estimation of direct genetic effects when parents are genotyped. However, parental genotypes are often missing. We introduce a method that imputes missing parental genotypes and estimates direct genetic effects. Our method, implemented in the software package snipar (single-nucleotide imputation of parents), gives more precise estimates of direct genetic effects than existing approaches. Using 39,614 individuals from the UK Biobank with at least one genotyped sibling/parent, we estimate the correlation between direct genetic effects and effects from standard GWASs for nine phenotypes, including educational attainment (r = 0.739, standard error (s.e.) = 0.086) and cognitive ability (r = 0.490, s.e. = 0.086).

However, translation of methods for recording fundamental computational units (e.g., single neurons and ensembles) has proven extremely difficult. This has led to an increasing gap between what can be learned in animal models and how these detailed principles apply to the human brain.

The Neuropixels probe combines advanced complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology with integrated amplification, digitization, and multiplexing circuits on the same device for large-scale, high-density recordings with streamlined data transfer without bulky cabling or connectorization. This innovative probe contains 960 12 × 12 μm contacts with 384 selectable recording channels, arranged along a 10-mm-long shank in a 4-column checkerboard pattern, with a 16-μm pitch across columns and 20-μm pitch across rows.

In this work, we report on 596 putative single units with cluster quality metrics from 11 recordings across 8 of our first 15 consecutively tested human participants, all of whom underwent craniotomy for a variety of clinical indications. Here, we demonstrate the method’s potential for access to dozens of simultaneously recorded single neurons, feasibility for intraoperative use, and access to a variety of target locations, and we also identify the relative motion of electrode array to brain as the next challenge in further improvement of cell yield. Neuropixels probes have tremendous promise for rapid and robust single-cell recordings at large scale in humans, with deep research and clinical potential. Intraoperative recordings utilizing the Neuropixels probe were attempted in 15 participants (Table 1). A Greenberg C-clamp, an articulating bar, 3 ball-joint arms, and a micromanipulator were attached to the Mayfield head clamp in series, allowing for gross targeting of the insertion location. The probe was then removed from custom-designed holders used during sterilization and transport and mounted to the micromanipulator (Figures 1A and 1B ). The insertion locations were at the center of a gyrus, away from surface vasculature, that was going to be resected in the same surgical procedure (Figure 1B). In some cases, a piotomy was performed to allow for easier probe penetration. The probe was then inserted to a targeted depth of 7 mm (to span the full depth of the cortex and also record channels at the brain/air boundary for movement tracking) (Video S1). In some cases, the insertion sites were far enough away from local vasculature to allow for safe en bloc resection and subsequent histology (Figure 1C). Targeted regions were in the right or left superior temporal gyrus in 5 of 8 participants with putative single units, the right middle frontal gyrus in 1 participant (Figures 1D and S1), the right ventral motor cortex in 1 participant, and the left angular gyrus in 1 participant, dependent solely on the resection plan for tissue destined for removal (Table 1). We found that reducing AC noise was key for achieving the required signal-to-noise ratio in the intraoperative environment. Furthermore, reducing positive end-expiratory pressure for intubated participants helped reduce the amplitude of brain pulsation reflected in recordings caused by both cardiac and respiratory cycles.Table 1Participant informationIDSpikesIsolable unitsSexAgeStateHemisphereRegion and procedurePathologyFailure reasonNP01nonoM31awakeleftanterior temporal resectiontumorshank broke upon insertionNP02nonoF25anesthetizedrightresection, frontal lobeepileptic foci (focal cortical dysplasia)noise issuesNP03yesyesM49asleeprightresection, frontal lobetumor–NP04yesyesF33awakeleftanterior temporal lobectomy (ATL)temporal epilepsynoise issuesNP05nonoF22awakeleftATLtemporal epilepsyprobe broke soon after insertionNP06yesnoF32awakeleftresection, motor cortexepileptic foci (focal cortical dysplasia)probe broke soon after insertionNP07nonoF54awakeleftATLtemporal epilepsynoise issuesNP08nonoM38awakeleftresection, post-central gyrusepileptic foci (focal cortical dysplasia)no spikesNP09nonoF57awakeleftanterior temporal resectiontumor–NP10yesyesF36anesthetizedrightATLtemporal epilepsy–NP11yesyesM49awakerightresection, motor cortexcavernoma–NP12yesyesF46anesthetizedrightATLtemporal epilepsy–NP13yesyesM25awakeleftATLtemporal epilepsy–NP14yesyesM35awakeleftATLtemporal epilepsy–NP15yesyesM27awakeleftresection, angular gyruscavernoma–Participants are listed in chronological order.

Insertion and intraoperative recording, related to Figure 1Intraoperative video of an insertion for participant NP12 demonstrating a representative deformation associated with penetration of pia (no piotomy performed), and pulsation associated with the cardiac and respiratory cycles. In cases where spiking was recorded, action potentials were apparent in the online filtered data (high-pass, 300 Hz) within seconds of insertion (all 13 insertions with visible action potentials within 30 s of insertion upon post-hoc review of 300 Hz high-pass filtered data across all 9 participants with spikes). In one case with visible spiking (NP06), the probe shank broke less than 1 min after insertion, and no putative single units were isolated from this brief recording. In one other insertion there was too much motion of the probe, relative to the brain, to isolate units (NP11, second insertion). In the 6 of 15 participants where no spiking was seen, 2 probes broke upon insertion, 3 had electrical noise that precluded successful recording (2 participants were awake, and 1 was anesthetized), and in 1 participant no spiking was seen despite low noise and successful insertion (NP09). In all cases where the probe broke during or soon after insertion, participants were awake. As more datasets were collected, issues related to probe fracture or noise were mitigated (see STAR Methods), with all 6 of the most recent recordings yielding spikes (Table 1). For the remainder of this paper, the 7 participants without isolable single units are excluded from further analyses. While at least some identifiable spiking was present immediately after insertion, total spiking activity increased for several minutes after insertion. The data were clustered and curated resulting in putative single units that generally aligned well to the action potentials seen in the band-pass-filtered data (Figures 2A and 2B ). Across all 11 insertions over 8 participants, half of the recorded units became active within seconds after reaching target depth (8.8 ± 9.2 s, mean ± SD), and 75% of the recorded units were active within 2 min (33 ± 37 s). The recordings done in anesthetized patients took significantly longer for units to be active after reaching target depth (50% of units at least one spike, anesthetized 18.4 ± 8.9 s, non-anesthetized 3.3 ± 2.6 s, Wilcoxon rank-sum p = 0.014; 75% of units at least one spike, anesthetized 67.3 ± 39.8 s, non-anesthetized 13.5 ± 12.8 s, Wilcoxon rank-sum p = 0.038; Figure 2C). Note that participant NP03 was asleep but not anesthetized during recording and exhibits an empirical cumulative distribution function more similar to that of anesthetized patients (Figure 2C). These timescales are compatible with meaningful recordings done within the time constraints of the intraoperative environment. There were 11 insertions that yielded putative single units. These recordings were 10 to 23 min in length (15 min 11 s ± 3 min 47 s, mean ± SD). A total of 596 putative single units were identified, with 11 to 94 units per insertion and 34 to 94 simultaneously recorded putative single units being isolated in each participant (best insertion per participant; 54.2 ± 27.2 putative single units, mean ± SD across all recordings). There was no significant relationship between length of recording and putative single-unit yield (Figure 2D, Spearman correlation = 0.44, p = 0.17). There was no difference in putative single-unit yield between anesthetized and non-anesthetized states (Wilcoxon rank-sum p = 0.78), and as expected, no difference was detected between hemisphere (Wilcoxon rank-sum p = 0.47) or participant’s sex (Wilcoxon rank-sum p = 0.65). There was no difference seen in single-unit yield by recording location (superior temporal gyrus versus non-superior temporal gyrus; Wilcoxon rank-sum p = 0.92). Clusters that passed manual curation, following automated spike sorting, spanned a range of quality across individual recordings (Figure S2) as quantified by cluster metrics (see STAR Methods for more details; all metrics reported as median and interquartile range; spike amplitude: 136, 108 to 189 μV; estimated proportion of amplitude histogram truncation: 0.0019, 0.0005 to 0.0266; signal-to-noise ratio: 4.2, 2.7 to 6.8; RMS noise in action potential band (300 Hz to 6 kHz): 6.81, 6.14 to 10.08; proportion of events violating 1-ms inter-spike interval: 0.0006, 0 to 0.0028; isolation: 0.993, 0.984 to 0.997; D-prime: 3.24, 2.77 to 3.86; firing rate: 0.91, 0.50 to 1.69 Hz; spike half-width: 0.33, 0.23 to 0.40 ms; spread: 120, 80 to 160 μm; amplitude decay: 0.67, 0.41 to 1.3 per μm; active channels: 11, 8 to 14 channels; Figures 3 and S3). Stability of the Neuropixels probe, relative to brain tissue during recording, is ideal to avoid movement artifacts and facilitate clean spike sorting. However, there are multiple factors acting on the probe that lead to small movements. Despite skull fixation, awake participants can cause slight shifting of the probe. We quantified and corrected for motion in our data using several methods. First, we used the motion stabilization algorithm implemented in the spike-sorting software Kilosort 2.5 (Pachitariu et al., 2021Pachitariu M. Rossant C. Steinmetz N. Colonell J. Bondy A.G. Winter O. Kushbanga B. J Sosa M. O’Shea D. et al.MouseLand/Kilosort: Kilosort 2.5.2021https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4482749Crossref Google Scholar; Steinmetz et al., 2021Steinmetz N.A. Aydin C. Lebedeva A.

Broux M. et al.Neuropixels 2.0: A miniaturized high-density probe for stable, long-term brain recordings.Science. 2021; 372: eabf4588https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abf4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Because of the high-density spacing of electrodes along the Neuropixels 1.0 probes, the waveform of a spike is captured over multiple adjacent channels—its “spike spatial footprint.” The algorithm tracks the footprint of each spike template as it moves over time and uses its vertical offset to stabilize the center location of the spike on the probe. These spatially re-registered data are then submitted to spike sorting and manual curation. This algorithm can detect and correct for movement on relatively slow timescales (2 s). Significant vertical motion was partially compensated for by using the motion correction in Kilosort 2.5 (Figure 4A). However, faster timescale motion remained in some recordings. We used a second approach to quantify this movement. We identified high-rate, high-amplitude, and spatially isolated putative single units to serve as spatial markers (Figures 4B [green trace] and S4). These units were tracked with 20-ms resolution to quantify motion (see STAR Methods for more information). Using this method, we measured an overall mean amplitude of movement of 251 ± 112 μm (mean ± SD, n = 11 recordings). We found that the mean motion of a recording was negatively correlated with the single-unit yield for that same recording (Spearman R = −0.62, p = 0.040, Figure 4D). Putative neurons may be intermittently detectable because of increased relative motion of electrode array and brain. To quantify the relative length of time a putative single unit had spiking activity in the recording, the presence ratio (Buccino et al., 2020Buccino A.P. Hurwitz C.L. Garcia S. Magland J. Siegle J.H. Hurwitz R. Hennig M.H. SpikeInterface, a unified framework for spike sorting.eLife. 2020; 9: e61834https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.61834Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was calculated. Briefly, the presence ratio is the proportion of a recording that a putative single unit has detected spikes (see STAR Methods for more information). There was no significant correlation between the mean motion and presence ratio of the putative single units (Spearman R = −0.19, p value = 0.57, Figure 4E). Access to tens of simultaneously recorded neurons across the depth of cortex allows analysis of the relative timings of the thousands of cell pairs relative to their locations. Single-unit pairs’ relative activity was stratified by cell-pair coordination index (CCI) (see STAR Methods). Briefly, cross-correlograms were calculated and the activity of cell pairs in close temporal proximity (within ± 50 ms) was compared with the next 100-ms period (from −100 to −50 ms and from 50 to 100 ms). Putative neuron pairs that fired more within ±50 ms than the next 100-ms period had positive CCI; putative neuron pairs that fired more within the −100 to −50 ms and 50 to 100 ms time period, combined, than the ± 50 ms time period had negative CCI. Datasets with more than 500 cell pairs were included in further analysis (Table 2). In all 4 of the datasets across 3 participants, cell pairs with positive CCI were significantly closer together than those with negative CCI (Figures 5 and S5; Table 2). The simultaneous recording of tens of single units and thousands of cell pairs across the depth of cortex allows for their relative spike timings and spatial locations to be studied at an unprecedented resolution in an awake human.Table 2Cell-pair coordination index and distanceIDNumber of cell pairsCCI and distance relationshipMedian distance positive CCI (μm)Median distance negative CCI (μm)Rank-sum p valueNP03811positive closer1220.018205.8e−04NP04734positive closer54012407.4e−11NP10-1752positive closer104013600.012NP10-2568positive closer76019509.8e−11NP10-316excluded–––NP11155excluded–––NP12207excluded–––NP13358excluded–––NP14-1473excluded–––NP14-229excluded–––NP15456excluded–––Participants and insertions listed in chronological order.

https://openalex.org/W4282917882,"The stereoselective synthesis of molecules bearing stereogenic phosphorus(V) centers represents an enduring challenge in organic chemistry. Although stereospecific nucleophilic substitution at P(V) provides a general strategy for elaborating optically active P(V) compounds, existing methods for accessing the requisite chiral building blocks rely almost entirely on diastereocontrol using chiral auxiliaries. Catalytic, enantioselective methods for the synthesis of synthetically versatile stereogenic P(V) building blocks offer an alternative approach to stereogenic-at-P(V) targets without requiring stoichiometric quantities of chiral control elements. Here, we report an enantioselective hydrogen-bond-donor-catalyzed synthesis of aryl chlorophosphonamidates and the development of these products as versatile chiral P(V) building blocks. We demonstrate that the two leaving groups on these chlorophosphonamidates can be displaced sequentially and stereospecifically to access a wide variety of stereogenic-at-P(V) compounds featuring diverse substitution patterns."
https://openalex.org/W4281875239,"Abstract Lysosomes are key cellular organelles that metabolize extra- and intracellular substrates. Alterations in lysosomal metabolism are implicated in ageing-associated metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. However, how lysosomal metabolism actively coordinates the metabolic and nervous systems to regulate ageing remains unclear. Here we report a fat-to-neuron lipid signalling pathway induced by lysosomal metabolism and its longevity-promoting role in Caenorhabditis elegans . We discovered that induced lysosomal lipolysis in peripheral fat storage tissue upregulates the neuropeptide signalling pathway in the nervous system to promote longevity. This cell-non-autonomous regulation is mediated by a specific polyunsaturated fatty acid, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, and LBP-3 lipid chaperone protein transported from the fat storage tissue to neurons. LBP-3 binds to dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, and acts through NHR-49 nuclear receptor and NLP-11 neuropeptide in neurons to extend lifespan. These results reveal lysosomes as a signalling hub to coordinate metabolism and ageing, and lysosomal signalling mediated inter-tissue communication in promoting longevity."
https://openalex.org/W4281747864,"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the most common form of preinvasive breast cancer and, despite treatment, a small fraction (5-10%) of DCIS patients develop subsequent invasive disease. A fundamental biologic question is whether the invasive disease arises from tumor cells in the initial DCIS or represents new unrelated disease. To address this question, we performed genomic analyses on the initial DCIS lesion and paired invasive recurrent tumors in 95 patients together with single-cell DNA sequencing in a subset of cases. Our data show that in 75% of cases the invasive recurrence was clonally related to the initial DCIS, suggesting that tumor cells were not eliminated during the initial treatment. Surprisingly, however, 18% were clonally unrelated to the DCIS, representing new independent lineages and 7% of cases were ambiguous. This knowledge is essential for accurate risk evaluation of DCIS, treatment de-escalation strategies and the identification of predictive biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W4282944333,"Early naturalists suggested that predation intensity increases toward the tropics, affecting fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes by latitude, but empirical support is still limited. Several studies have measured consumption rates across latitude at large scales, with variable results. Moreover, how predation affects prey community composition at such geographic scales remains unknown. Using standardized experiments that spanned 115° of latitude, at 36 nearshore sites along both coasts of the Americas, we found that marine predators have both higher consumption rates and consistently stronger impacts on biomass and species composition of marine invertebrate communities in warmer tropical waters, likely owing to fish predators. Our results provide robust support for a temperature-dependent gradient in interaction strength and have potential implications for how marine ecosystems will respond to ocean warming."
https://openalex.org/W4281693356,"Transplantation of B cells engineered ex vivo to secrete broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has shown efficacy in disease models. However, clinical translation of this approach would require specialized medical centers, technically demanding protocols and major histocompatibility complex compatibility of donor cells and recipients. Here we report in vivo B cell engineering using two adeno-associated viral vectors, with one coding for Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (saCas9) and the other for 3BNC117, an anti-HIV bNAb. After intravenously injecting the vectors into mice, we observe successful editing of B cells leading to memory retention and bNAb secretion at neutralizing titers of up to 6.8 µg ml-1. We observed minimal clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 off-target cleavage as detected by unbiased CHANGE-sequencing analysis, whereas on-target cleavage in undesired tissues is reduced by expressing saCas9 from a B cell-specific promoter. In vivo B cell engineering to express therapeutic antibodies is a safe, potent and scalable method, which may be applicable not only to infectious diseases but also in the treatment of noncommunicable conditions, such as cancer and autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W4281918263,"Synthetic methods that enable simultaneous control over multiple stereogenic centers are desirable for the efficient preparation of pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, we report the discovery and development of a catalyst-mediated asymmetric Michael addition/crystallization-induced diastereomer transformation of broad scope. The sequence controls three stereogenic centers, two of which are stereochemically labile. The configurational instability of 1,3-dicarbonyls and nitroalkanes, typically considered a liability in stereoselective synthesis, is productively leveraged by merging enantioselective Brønsted base organocatalysis and thermodynamic stereocontrol using a single convergent crystallization. The synthesis of useful γ-nitro β-keto amides containing three contiguous stereogenic centers is thus achieved from Michael acceptors containing two prochiral centers."
https://openalex.org/W4282921804,"Animals adaptively integrate sensation, planning, and action to navigate toward goal locations in ever-changing environments, but the functional organization of cortex supporting these processes remains unclear. We characterized encoding in approximately 90,000 neurons across the mouse posterior cortex during a virtual navigation task with rule switching. The encoding of task and behavioral variables was highly distributed across cortical areas but differed in magnitude, resulting in three spatial gradients for visual cue, spatial position plus dynamics of choice formation, and locomotion, with peaks respectively in visual, retrosplenial, and parietal cortices. Surprisingly, the conjunctive encoding of these variables in single neurons was similar throughout the posterior cortex, creating high-dimensional representations in all areas instead of revealing computations specialized for each area. We propose that, for guiding navigation decisions, the posterior cortex operates in parallel rather than hierarchically, and collectively generates a state representation of the behavior and environment, with each area specialized in handling distinct information modalities."
https://openalex.org/W4281759591,"Membrane proteins, including ion channels, receptors and transporters, are often composed of multiple subunits and can form large complexes. Their specific composition in native tissues is difficult to determine and remains largely unknown. In this study, we developed a method for determining the subunit composition of endogenous cell surface protein complexes from isolated native tissues. Our method relies on nanobody-based sensors, which enable proximity detection between subunits in time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. Additionally, given conformation-specific nanobodies, the activation of these complexes can be recorded in native brain tissue. Applied to the metabotropic glutamate receptors in different brain regions, this approach revealed the clear existence of functional metabotropic glutamate (mGlu)2-mGlu4 heterodimers in addition to mGlu2 and mGlu4 homodimers. Strikingly, the mGlu4 subunits appear to be mainly heterodimers in the brain. Overall, these versatile biosensors can determine the presence and activity of endogenous membrane proteins in native tissues with high fidelity and convenience."

https://openalex.org/W4281667325,"Mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes establish and maintain chromatin accessibility and gene expression, and are frequently perturbed in cancer. Clear cell meningioma (CCM), an aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, is uniformly driven by loss of SMARCE1, an integral subunit of the mSWI/SNF core. Here, we identify a structural role for SMARCE1 in selectively stabilizing the canonical BAF (cBAF) complex core–ATPase module interaction. In CCM, cBAF complexes fail to stabilize on chromatin, reducing enhancer accessibility, and residual core module components increase the formation of BRD9-containing non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complexes. Combined attenuation of cBAF function and increased ncBAF complex activity generates the CCM-specific gene expression signature, which is distinct from that of NF2-mutated meningiomas. Importantly, SMARCE1-deficient cells exhibit heightened sensitivity to small-molecule inhibition of ncBAF complexes. These data inform the function of a previously elusive SWI/SNF subunit and suggest potential therapeutic approaches for intractable SMARCE1-deficient CCM tumors. SMARCE1 loss destabilizes the canonical BAF complex and increases the formation of BRD9-containing non-canonical (ncBAF) complexes. SMARCE1-deficient cells, which are a model for clear cell meningioma, are sensitive to ncBAF complex inhibition."

Despite worldwide vaccination, social distancing and wearing masks, the spread of the virus is ongoing. One of the mechanisms by which neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) block virus entry into cells encompasses interaction inhibition between the cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb development can be induced in the blood of cattle. Pregnant cows produce NAbs upon immunization, and antibodies move into the colostrum immediately before calving. Here, we immunized cows with SARS-CoV-2 S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) protein in proper adjuvant solutions, followed by one boost with SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S protein and purified immunoglobulins from colostrum. We demonstrate that this preparation indeed blocks the interaction between the trimeric S protein and ACE2 in different in vitro assays. Moreover, we describe the formulation of purified immunoglobulin preparation into a nasal spray. When administered to human subjects, the formulation persisted on the nasal mucosa for at least 4 hours, as determined by a clinical study. Therefore, we are presenting a solution that shows great potential to serve as a prophylactic agent against SARS-CoV-2 infection as an additional measure to vaccination and wearing masks. Moreover, our technology allows for rapid and versatile adaptation for preparing prophylactic treatments against other diseases using the defined characteristics of antibody movement into the colostrum."

https://openalex.org/W4281618565,"Potentially, the risk of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy and child birth can be prevented through comprehensive, quality antenatal care services. The high maternal mortality rate in developing countries, including Ethiopia, is related to poor quality of antenatal care services and is still a major public health problem. The aim of this study is to assess the quality of antenatal care and associated factors in public health centers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted using a quantitative method from December 10 to January 30, 2020. A total of 616 study participants were selected by a systematic random sampling technique. Data was collected using pre-tested structured interview administered questionnaires. The data was entered into Epi-info version 7.2.1 and analyzed by SPSS version 24. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were performed to identify the presence and strength of the association between the outcome and predictor variables.Overall, 33% of pregnant women received good-quality antenatal care. Satisfaction with antenatal care service, antenatal care initiation time, maintaining confidentiality, and waiting time become significant predictors of the quality of antenatal care. As a result, a lack of confidential care (AOR = 0.37; 95% CI, (0.40, 0.88)), a long waiting time (AOR = 0.6, 95% CI, (0.48, 0.88)), and no satisfaction with ANC services (AOR = 0.26; 95% CI, (0.109, 0.36)) were identified as factors impeding the quality of antenatal care. While starting ANC later than four months of pregnancy was found to be a positive predictor of the quality of antenatal care (AOR = 1.9, 95% CI: (1.21, 3.12)).Only one-third of pregnant mothers received good quality antenatal care. Lack of confidential care, long waiting time and no satisfaction with antenatal care services were factors hindering the quality of antenatal care. While initiation of antenatal care after four months of pregnancy was a positive predictor of the quality of antenatal care."

https://openalex.org/W4285410791,"Background and aims Obesity is linked to elevated levels of inflammatory serum markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa). Adiponectin and resistin are adipokines related to obesity. It has been described that adipose tissue presents a high production and secretion of these diverse pro-inflammatory molecules, which may have local effects on the physiology of fat cells as well as systemic effects on other organs. Our aim was to evaluate the impact that lifestyle modifications, by following a Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) program and physical activity (PA) training, would have on inflammatory biomarkers and adipokine profile in a Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO) elderly population from Malaga (Andalusia, Spain). Subjetcs and methods Subjects aged ≥65 years (65 to 87 years old) with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 ) were included in this study if they met ≤1 of the following criteria: systolic blood pressure ≥130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 85 mmHg; triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL; HDL-C &lt;40mg/dL in men and &lt;50mg/dL women; and fasting blood glucose ≥100mg/dL. Selected subjects underwent a personalized intensive lifestyle modification. Anthropometric measurements, PA, MedDiet adherence, analytical parameters, and inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed after 12 months of intervention. Results 166 MHO elderly subjects, 40 (24.1%) male and 126 (75.9%) female (p &lt; 0.0001), aged 71.7±5.2 years old (65 to 87 years old) were included in the study. After 12 months of intervention, only the waist circumference was significantly reduced in all the population (-2.5 cm, p&lt;0.0001), although weight and BMI were maintained. MedDiet adherence increased significantly (p&lt;0.001), but all intensity levels of PA decreased significantly (p&lt;0.001). Concerning inflammatory biomarkers, only TNFa serum increased their levels after the intervention (p&lt;0.001). Regarding the adipokine profile, adiponectin concentrations experienced a significant increment (p&lt;0.001); besides, resistin concentrations decreased significantly (p&lt;0.001). In this sense, only TNFa, adiponectin, and resistin correlated with PA. Adiponectin also correlates with insulin, triglycerides and HDL-c in baseline conditions and after 12 months of intervention; CRP, IL-6, TNFa, adiponectin, and resistin concentrations correlated with anthropometric parameters and some intensities of PA. In addition, adiponectin levels correlates with insulin, triglycerides and HDL-c. In baseline conditions, resistin levels correlated positively with TNFa (p = 0.01) and CRP (p&lt;0.0001) levels. TNFa and IL-6 correlated positively with CRP (p = 0.03 and p&lt;0.0001, respectively). After 12 months of intervention, only IL-6 correlated positively with CRP (p = 0.006). In addition, adipokines levels correlated positively during the process of lifestyle modification. However, during this process, only IL-6 correlated positively with itself (p&lt;0.0001) and with CRP (p = 0.03). Conclusion Healthy aging is a multifactorial biological process in which lifestyle is essential. The presence of obesity in elderly metabolically healthy population is not a problem necessarily. Elderly MHO population who eat a MedDiet and practice regularly PA are capable to modulate their production of inflammatory cytokines (CRP, IL-6, TNFa) and adipokines profile (adiponectin, resistin), preventing other metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4281691040,"Sarcopenia is an aging-associated attenuation of muscular volume and strength and is the major cause of frailty and falls in elderly individuals. The number of individuals with sarcopenia is rapidly increasing worldwide; however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of the disease. Sarcopenia often copresents with obesity, and some patients with sarcopenia exhibit accumulation of peri-organ or intra-organ adipose tissue as ectopic fat deposition, including atrophied skeletal muscle. In this study, we showed that transplantation of the perimuscular adipose tissue (PMAT) to the hindlimb thigh muscles of young mice decreased the number of integrin α7/CD29-double positive muscular stem/progenitor cells and that the reaction was mediated by PMAT-derived exosomes. We also found that the inhibition of cell proliferation was induced by Let-7d-3p miRNA that targets HMGA2, which is an important transcription factor for stem cell self-renewal, in muscular stem/progenitor cells and the composite molecular reaction in aged adipocytes. Reduction of Let-7 miRNA repressor Lin28 A/B and activation of nuclear factor-kappa B signaling can lead to the accumulation of Let-7d-3p in the exosomes of aged PMAT. These findings suggest a novel crosstalk between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in the development of aging-associated muscular atrophy and indicate that adipose tissue-derived miRNAs may play a key role in sarcopenia."
https://openalex.org/W4285505940,"Understanding the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the cultural heritage of the Yellow River Basin can effectively improve the scientific understanding of the historical changes, environmental evolution, and cultural and economic development of the Yellow River Basin and thus provide a scientific and reasonable decision-making basis for the protection and development of its cultural heritage. The research object of this paper are the national cultural relic protection units. These are examined using the GIS spatial analysis method to explore the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and spatial structure of 2,102 national material cultural heritage sites in the Yellow River basin. The results show that the spatial distribution of cultural heritage has a significant spatial agglomeration effect. The whole basin is concentrated in stable high- and low-value areas, and the difference between the high- and low-value areas is clear. Some aspects of the spatial structure heterogeneity are strong, showing a low value dispersion distribution trend. In different periods, the distribution direction and scope of cultural heritage have low ranges of rotation, a clear direction, and a high degree of centripetal distribution. The spatial and temporal distribution of cultural heritage is the result of the combined action of natural geographical environment such as climate change, topography, river hydrology, and human environment such as administrative institutional changes, ideological evolution, and social and economic development."
https://openalex.org/W4281671479,"Stream temperatures in the Pacific Northwest are projected to increase with climate change, placing additional stress on cold-water salmonids. We modeled the potential impact of increased stream temperatures on four anadromous salmonid populations in the Chehalis River Basin (spring-run and fall-run Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, coho salmon O. kisutch, and steelhead O. mykiss), as well as the potential for floodplain reconnection and stream shade restoration to offset the effects of future temperature increases. In the Chehalis River Basin, peak summer stream temperatures are predicted to increase by as much as 3°C by late-century, but restoration actions can locally decrease temperatures by as much as 6°C. On average, however, basin-wide average stream temperatures are expected to increase because most reaches have low temperature reduction potential for either restoration action relative to climate change. Results from the life cycle models indicated that, without restoration actions, increased summer temperatures are likely to produce significant declines in spawner abundance by late-century for coho (-29%), steelhead (-34%), and spring-run Chinook salmon (-95%), and smaller decreases for fall-run Chinook salmon (-17%). Restoration actions reduced these declines in all cases, although model results suggest that temperature restoration alone may not fully mitigate effects of future temperature increases. Notably, floodplain reconnection provided a greater benefit than riparian restoration for steelhead and both Chinook salmon populations, but riparian restoration provided a greater benefit for coho. This pattern emerged because coho salmon tend to spawn and rear in smaller streams where shade restoration has a larger effect on stream temperature, whereas Chinook and steelhead tend to occupy larger rivers where temperatures are more influenced by floodplain connectivity. Spring-run Chinook salmon are the only population for which peak temperatures affect adult prespawn survival in addition to rearing survival, making them the most sensitive species to increasing stream temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W4281801782,"Untreated pain after surgery leads to poor patient satisfaction, longer hospital length of stay, lower health-related quality of life, and non-compliance with rehabilitation regimens. The aim of this study is to characterize the structure of acute pain trajectories during the postsurgical hospitalization period and quantify their association with pain at 30-days and 1-year after surgery. This cohort study included 2106 adult (≥18 years) surgical patients who consented to participate in the SATISFY-SOS registry (February 1, 2015 to September 30, 2017). Patients were excluded if they did not undergo invasive surgeries, were classified as outpatients, failed to complete follow up assessments at 30-days and 1-year following surgery, had greater than 4-days of inpatient stay, and/or recorded fewer than four pain scores during their acute hospitalization period. The primary exposure was the acute postsurgical pain trajectories identified by a machine learning-based latent class approach using patient-reported pain scores. Clinically meaningful pain (≥3 on a 0–10 scale) at 30-days and 1-year after surgery were the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Of the study participants (N = 2106), 59% were female, 91% were non-Hispanic White, and the mean (SD) age was 62 (13) years; 41% of patients underwent orthopedic surgery and 88% received general anesthesia. Four acute pain trajectory clusters were identified. Pain trajectories were significantly associated with clinically meaningful pain at 30-days ( p = 0.007), but not at 1-year ( p = 0.79) after surgery using covariate-adjusted logistic regression models. Compared to Cluster 1, the other clusters had lower statistically significant odds of having pain at 30-days after surgery (Cluster 2: [OR = 0.67, 95%CI (0.51–0.89)]; Cluster 3:[OR = 0.74, 95%CI (0.56–0.99)]; Cluster 4:[OR = 0.46, 95%CI (0.26–0.82)], all p &lt;0.05). Patients in Cluster 1 had the highest cumulative likelihood of pain and pain intensity during the latter half of their acute hospitalization period (48–96 hours), potentially contributing to the higher odds of pain during the 30-day postsurgical period. Early identification and management of high-risk pain trajectories can help in ascertaining appropriate pain management interventions. Such interventions can mitigate the occurrence of long-term disabilities associated with pain."

However, little is known about the molecular basis of the biotrophic lifestyle, despite the impact of fungi on the environment and food security. In this work, we show that combinations of organic acids and glucose trigger phenotypes that are associated with the late stage of biotrophy for the maize pathogen Ustilago maydis. These phenotypes include the expression of a set of effectors normally observed only during biotrophic development, as well as the formation of melanin associated with sporulation in plant tumors. U. maydis and other hemibiotrophic fungi also respond to a combination of carbon sources with enhanced proliferation. Thus, the response to combinations of nutrients from the host may be a conserved feature of fungal biotrophy."
https://openalex.org/W4285684759,"Background Uncertainty and time pressure in emergency departments add a challenge to the rational decision-making process, specifically when encountering a critical patient who requires a prompt response. However, there has been little attempt to develop a mental structure model to understand the thought processes and identify cognitive weaknesses points in nurses’ decision-making. A better understanding can inform changes in both practice learning strategies and decision-making in emergency department. This study aims to better understand how newly employed nurses process information and initiate actions in emergency situations characterized by time constraints and uncertainty. Method Participants worked under time pressure and uncertainty to solve a simulated shock case by establishing an assumption of what type of shock the simulated patient might have and its cause. An 8-minute window was available to initiate action. Following the simulation, a retrospective think-aloud interview was conducted. Findings Participants’ ability to identify the category of shock was better than their ability to identify the underlaying cause of the shock. This influenced their ability to intervene correctly. Participants’ thinking process in an emergency situation can be organized using ABCDE acronym as follows: (1) a wareness of the situation, followed by, an instant (2) generation of b eliefs (presumption), (3) c ontrolling the c onsequence (first-line management action), (4) involvement in d eliberate thinking and, finally (5) e x e cution, actions (second-line management action). The cognitive weakness was mainly noticed during the first-line management action when participants were involved in immediate lifesaving activities. Conclusion Classification of the steps involved in decision-making when encountering emergency situations may provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the thought process at different stages. Further studies are required."

Of the 426 community pharmacists approached, 384 community pharmacists participated in this study, giving a response rate of 90.14%. The majority of the respondents were females (63.5%), graduated from local universities (74.9%), with median years of practising as a community pharmacist of six years (interquartile range, IQR = 9 years). The respondents were found to have moderate levels of doping-related knowledge (median score of 52 out of 100). Anabolic steroids (95.8%), stimulants (78.6%) and growth factors (65.6%) were recognised as prohibited substances by most of the respondents. Around 65.9% did not recognise that inadvertent doping is also considered a doping violation. Most of them (90%) also have poor levels of knowledge of doping scenarios in the country. Community pharmacists in Malaysia have limited knowledge in the field of doping.

However, the structural determinants facilitating this efficiency are unclear. Here, we report the crystal structures of ligand-free and Gly-Pro-hydroxyproline (Hyp)-complexed Ghcol at 2.2 and 2.4 Å resolution, respectively. These structures revealed that the activator and peptidase domains in Ghcol form a saddle-shaped structure with one zinc ion and four calcium ions. In addition, the activator domain comprises two homologous subdomains, whereas zinc-bound water was observed in the ligand-free Ghcol. In the ligand-complexed Ghcol, we found two Gly-Pro-Hyp molecules, each bind at the active site and at two surfaces on the duplicate subdomains of the activator domain facing the active site, and the nucleophilic water is replaced by the carboxyl oxygen of Hyp at the P1 position. Furthermore, all Gly-Pro-Hyp molecules bound to Ghcol have almost the same conformation as Pro-Pro-Gly motif in model collagen (Pro-Pro-Gly)10, suggesting these three sites contribute to the unwinding of the collagen triple helix. A comparison of activities revealed that Ghcol exhibits broader substrate specificity than clostridial collagenase at the P2 and P2' positions, which may be attributed to the larger space available for substrate binding at the S2 and S2' sites in Ghcol. Analysis of variants of three active-site Tyr residues revealed that mutation of Tyr564 affected catalysis, whereas mutation of Tyr476 or Tyr555 affected substrate recognition. These results provide insights into the substrate specificity and mechanism of G. hollisae collagenase."

Studies were evaluated according to ESMO-MCBS, ASCO-VF and OLUtool. Substantial benefit for ESMO-MCBS, was defined as a grade A or B for (neo)adjuvant intent and 4 or 5 for palliative intent. For ASCO-VF and OLUtool clinical benefit was defined as score ≥45 and A or B, respectively. Concordance between the frameworks was calculated with Cohen's Kappa (κ). Factors associated with clinical benefit were evaluated by logistic regression.In the study period, 48 drugs were approved for 92 evaluable indications, based on 100 studies. Ratings for ESMO-MCBS, ASCO-VF and OLUtool could be performed for 100, 86, and 97 studies, respectively. Overall, 39 (39%), 44 (51%), 45 (46%) of the studies showed substantial clinical benefit according to ESMO-MCBS v1.1, ASCO-VF, OLUtool criteria, respectively. There was fair concordance between ESMO-MCBS and ASCO-VF in the palliative setting (κ = 0.31, P = 0.004) and moderate concordance between ESMO-MCBS and OLUtool (κ = 0.41, P<0.001). There was no significant concordance between ASCO-VF and OLUtool (κ = 0.18, P = 0.12).

https://openalex.org/W4281778063,"Abstract Marine cyanobacteria are critical players in global nutrient cycles that crucially depend on trace metals in metalloenzymes, including zinc for CO 2 fixation and phosphorus acquisition. How strains proliferating in the vast oligotrophic ocean gyres thrive at ultra-low zinc concentrations is currently unknown. Using Synechococcus sp. WH8102 as a model we show that its zinc-sensor protein Zur differs from all other known bacterial Zur proteins in overall structure and the location of its sensory zinc site. Uniquely, Synechococcus Zur activates metallothionein gene expression, which supports cellular zinc quotas spanning two orders of magnitude. Thus, a single zinc sensor facilitates growth across pico- to micromolar zinc concentrations with the bonus of banking this precious resource. The resultant ability to grow well at both ultra-low and excess zinc, together with overall lower zinc requirements, likely contribute to the broad ecological distribution of Synechococcus across the global oceans."
https://openalex.org/W4281789188,"The South African macadamia industry is severely affected by a complex of stink bugs, dominated by the two-spotted stink bug, Bathycoelia distincta Distant (Pentatomidae). This species was first discovered during the spring of 1984 in the Limpopo province. Although considerable effort has been spent trying to manage this pest, it continues to be a pest of concern for the macadamia industry. Information on the genetic diversity of this species is lacking, despite the potential relevance of such information for management strategies. The present study aimed to characterise the genetic diversity of B. distincta populations in South Africa. The Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit 1 (COI) and cytochrome b (Cytb) gene regions were sequenced from individuals collected from the three main regions of macadamia production over three different seasons (2018-2020). An overall high haplotype diversity (COI = 0.744, Cytb = 0.549 and COI+Cytb = 0.875) was observed. Pairwise mean genetic distance between populations from each region varied from 0.2-0.4% in both datasets, which suggests the absence of cryptic species. The median joining network for both datasets consisted of one or two central haplotypes shared between the regions in addition to unique haplotypes observed in each region. Finally, low genetic differentiation (FST < 0.1), high gene flow (Nm > 1) and the absence of a correlation between genetic and geographic distance were estimated among populations. Overall, these results suggest that the B. distincta populations are not structured among the areas of macadamia production in South Africa. This might be due to its ability to feed and reproduce on various plants and its high dispersal (airborne) between the different growing regions of the country along with the rapid expansion of macadamia plantations in South Africa."
https://openalex.org/W4281989068,"Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a common opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the nasopharynx. NTHi infections result in enormous global morbidity in two clinical settings: otitis media in children and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. Thus, there is an urgent need to design and develop effective vaccines to prevent morbidity and reduce antibiotic use. The NTHi outer membrane protein P6, a potential vaccine candidate, is highly conserved and effectively induces protective immunity. Here, to enhance mucosal immune responses, P6-loaded mannose-modified chitosan (MC) microspheres (P6-MCMs) were developed for mucosal delivery. MC (18.75%) was synthesized by the reductive amination reaction method using sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH 3 CN), and P6-MCMs with an average size of 590.4±16.2 nm were successfully prepared via the tripolyphosphate (TPP) ionotropic gelation process. After intranasal immunization with P6-MCMs, evaluation of humoral immune responses indicated that P6-MCMs enhance both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Evaluation of cellular immune responses indicated that P6-MCMs enhance cellular immunity and trigger a mixed Th1/Th2-type immune response. Importantly, P6-MCMs also trigger a Th17-type immune response. They are effective in promoting lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation without toxicity in vitro. The results also demonstrate that P6-MCMs can effectively induce MHC class I- and II-restricted cross-presentation, promoting CD4 + -mediated Th immune responses and CD8 + -mediated cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immune responses. Evaluation of protective immunity indicated that immunization with P6-MCMs can reduce inflammation in the nasal mucosa and the lung and prevent NTHi infection. In conclusion, MCMs are a promising adjuvant-delivery system for vaccines against NTHi."

The life history of many shark species is still poorly known and understanding their dietary ontogeny is a challenging task, especially for highly migratory species. Stable isotope analysis has proven as a useful method for examining the foraging strategies of sharks and other marine predators. We assessed the foraging strategies and ontogenetic changes of scalloped hammerhead sharks, Sphyrna lewini , at Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR), by analysing δ 13 C and δ 15 N signatures in different maturity stages. Our isotopic results suggest ontogenetic shifts in resource use between sub-adult and adult stages, but not between adult and juvenile stages. Carbon isotopic signatures found in the juvenile stage were enriched in contrast to sub-adults (~0.73‰) suggesting a combination of the maternal input and the use of coastal resources around the Galapagos Islands. Adult female sharks also showed enrichment in δ 13 C (~0.53‰) in comparison to sub-adult stages that suggest feeding in high primary productivity areas, such as the GMR. This study improves the understanding of the trophic ecology and ontogenetic changes of a highly migratory shark that moves across the protected and unprotected waters of the Eastern Tropical Pacific."
https://openalex.org/W4281718943,"The outermost lipid-exposed α-helix (M4) in each of the homologous α, β, δ, and γ/ε subunits of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has previously been proposed to act as a lipid sensor. However, the mechanism by which this sensor would function is not clear. To explore how the M4 α-helix from each subunit in human adult muscle nAChR influences function, and thus explore its putative role in lipid sensing, we functionally characterized alanine mutations at every residue in αM4, βM4, δM4, and εM4, along with both alanine and deletion mutations in the post-M4 region of each subunit. Although no critical interactions involving residues on M4 or in post-M4 were identified, we found that numerous mutations at the M4-M1/M3 interface altered the agonist-induced response. In addition, homologous mutations in M4 in different subunits were found to have different effects on channel function. The functional effects of multiple mutations either along M4 in one subunit or at homologous positions of M4 in different subunits were also found to be additive. Finally, when characterized in both Xenopus oocytes and human embryonic kidney 293T cells, select αM4 mutations displayed cell-specific phenotypes, possibly because of the different membrane lipid environments. Collectively, our data suggest different functional roles for the M4 α-helix in each heteromeric nAChR subunit and predict that lipid sensing involving M4 occurs primarily through the cumulative interactions at the M4-M1/M3 interface, as opposed to the alteration of specific interactions that are critical to channel function."
https://openalex.org/W4281746311,"Introduction Indigenous people represent approximately 5% of the world’s population. However, they often have a disproportionately higher burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and chronic kidney disease (CKD) than their equivalent general population. Several non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., educational) have been used to reduce CVD and kidney disease risk factors in Indigenous groups. The aim of this paper is to describe the protocol for a scoping review that will assess the impact of non-pharmacological interventions carried out in Indigenous and remote dwelling populations to reduce CVD risk factors and CKD. Materials and methods This scoping review will be guided by the methodological framework for conducting scoping studies developed by Arksey and O’Malley. Both empirical (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science and PsycINFO) and grey literature references will be assessed if they focused on interventions targeted at reducing CVD or CKD among Indigenous groups. Two reviewers will independently screen references in consecutive stages of title/abstract screening and then full-text screening. Impact of interventions used will be assessed using the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. A descriptive overview, tabular summaries, and content analysis will be carried out on the extracted data. Ethics and dissemination This review will collect and analyse evidence on the impact of interventions of research carried out to reduce CVD and CKD among Indigenous populations. Such evidence will be disseminated using traditional approaches that includes open-access peer-reviewed publication, scientific presentations, and a report. Also, we will disseminate our findings to the government and Indigenous leaders. Ethical approval will not be required for this scoping review as the data used will be extracted from already published studies with publicly accessible data."
https://openalex.org/W4281678467,"Background The number of patients aged 80 years or older with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is increasing, and the incidence rate of the disease in this population group reaches up to 20%. The risk of infection is higher in older patients than in other patients. Although hypnotic drugs are frequently detected as potentially inappropriate medications, it is unclear whether hypnotic drugs affect the occurrence of infection during chemotherapy. Here, we investigated whether the use of hypnotic drugs is associated with infection during first-line chemotherapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) aged 80 years or older. Methods Japanese patients aged 80 years or older with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who had received first-line chemotherapy at Fujita Health University Hospital from January 2005 to March 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. The primary study outcome was the identification of the risk factor for infection during first-line chemotherapy. Results This study included 65 patients received first-line chemotherapy. The proportion of patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network-international prognostic index ≥ 6 was higher in the infection group than in the non-infection group. The relative dose intensity of each anticancer drug (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and vincristine) and dose of prednisolone did not significantly differ between the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of benzodiazepines was a risk factor for infection (odds ratio, 4.131 [95% confidence interval: 1.225–13.94], P = 0.022). Conclusion DLBCL patients using benzodiazepines should be monitored for infection symptoms during chemotherapy."
