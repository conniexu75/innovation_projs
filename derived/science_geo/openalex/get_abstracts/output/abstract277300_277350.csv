https://openalex.org/W1994858643,"Data obtained from measurements of the stratospheric aerosol at Laramie, Wyoming (41 degrees N), indicate that the background or nonvolcanic stratospheric sulfuric acid aerosol mass at northern mid-latitudes has increased by about 5 +/- 2 percent per year during the past 10 years. Whether this increase is natural or anthropogenic could not be determined at this time because of inadequate information on sulfur sources, in particular, carbonyl sulfide, which is thought to be the dominant nonvolcanic source of stratospheric sulfuric acid vapor. An increase in stratospheric sulfate levels has important climatic implications as well as heterogeneous chemical effects that may alter the concentration of stratospheric ozone."
https://openalex.org/W2021663491,"Geophysical discontinuities in Earth's upper mantle and experimental data predict the structural transformation of pyroxene to garnet and the solid-state dissolution of pyroxene into garnet with increasing depth. These predictions are indirectly verified by omphacitic pyroxene exsolution in pyropic garnet-bearing xenoliths from a diamondiferous kimberlite. Conditions for silicon in octahedral sites in the original garnets are met at pressures greater than 130 kilobars, placing the origin of these xenoliths at depths of 300 to 400 kilometers. These ultradeep xenoliths support the theory that the 400-km seismic discontinuity is marked by a transition from peridotite to eclogite."
https://openalex.org/W2004328002,"The region of sea floor beneath French Polynesia (the ""Superswell"") is anomalous in that its depth is too shallow, flexural strength too weak, seismic velocity too slow, and geoid anomaly too negative for its lithospheric age as determined from magnetic isochrons. These features evidently are the effect of excess heat and extremely low viscosity in the upper mantle that maintain a thin lithospheric plate so easily penetrated by volcanism that 30 percent of the heat flux from all hot spots is liberated in this region, which constitutes only 3 percent of the earth's surface. The low-viscosity zone may facilitate rapid plate motion and the development of small-scale convection. A possible heat supply for the Superswell is a mantle reservoir enriched in radioactive isotopes as suggested by the geochemical signature of lavas from Superswell volcanoes."
https://openalex.org/W2053719874,"A method for reconstructing images from projections is described. The unique aspect of the procedure is that the reconstruction of the internal structure can be carried out for objects that diffuse the incident radiation. The method may be used with photons, phonons, neutrons, and many other kinds of radiation. The procedure has applications to medical imaging, industrial imaging, and geophysical imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2022958204,"The present understanding of the atmosphere and surface conditions on Saturn's largest moon, Titan, including the stability of methane, and an application of thermodynamics leads to a strong prediction of liquid hydrocarbons in an ethane-methane mixture on the surface. Such a surface would have nearly unique microwave reflection properties due to the low dielectric constant. Attempts were made to obtain reflections at a wavelength of 3.5 centimeters by means of a 70-meter antenna in California as the transmitter and the Very Large Array in New Mexico as the receiving instrument. Statistically significant echoes were obtained that show Titan is not covered with a deep, global ocean of ethane, as previously thought. The experiment yielded radar cross sections normalized by the Titan disk of 0.38 +/- 0.15, 0.78 +/- 0.15, and 0.25 +/- 0.15 on three consecutive nights during which the sub-Earth longitude on Titan moved 50 degrees. The result for the combined data for the entire experiment is 0.35 +/- 0.08. The cross sections are very high, most consistent with those of the Galilean satellites; no evidence of the putative liquid ethane was seen in the reflection data. A global ocean as shallow as about 200 meters would have exhibited reflectivities smaller by an order of magnitude, and below the detection limit of the experiment. The measured emissivity at similar wavelengths of about 0.9 is somewhat inconsistent with the high reflectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2094986130,Coincidence counting techniques have been combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry in the examination of surfaces for chemical microhomogeneity. A mathematical formalism was developed to describe the principles underlying this coincidence counting technique and was used to produce a quantitative method for handling the data obtained. This technique of testing for chemical homogeneity has been demonstrated with a sample that consists of a physical mixture of polystyrene and crystals of NaF which were tenths of micrometers in diameter. Ultimately this approach is expected to be useful for the routine testing of surfaces for chemical homogeneity at the level of tens of nanometers.

https://openalex.org/W1985931694,"Previously unknown strike-slip and normal faults in the central and eastern Mojave Desert have been revealed on Landsat Thematic Mapper images enhanced by four-component processing. This method provides color images on which lithologies are discriminated by their contrasting absorption and reflection, primarily at infrared wavelengths and particularly with regard to their ferric iron, ferrous iron, and hydroxyl contents, while retaining landform depiction. These discriminants represent a new type of geophysical display for geologic mapping in regions of well-exposed bedrock. Faults are revealed on the images by abrupt spectral and textural contrasts that coincide with aligned topographic features. The newly discovered faults form part of an extensive regional network of right shear that connects faults in the Death Valley region with the San Andreas fault system. They support a heterogeneous strain model for late Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the region. Regional structural relations indicate a westward migration of the locus of strain through time. Some of the newly identified faults bound blocks that have experienced contrasting rotational histories since early Miocene time."
