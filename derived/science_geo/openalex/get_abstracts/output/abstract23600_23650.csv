https://openalex.org/W2054042846,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a plasminogen-like protein thought to be a humoral mediator of liver regeneration. A 145-kilodalton tyrosyl phosphoprotein observed in rapid response to HGF treatment of intact target cells was identified by immunoblot analysis as the beta subunit of the c-met proto-oncogene product, a membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase. Covalent cross-linking of 125I-labeled ligand to cellular proteins of appropriate size that were recognized by antibodies to c-met directly established the c-met product as the cell-surface receptor for HGF."
https://openalex.org/W2126440278,"In resting human epithelial and fibroblastic cells, c-Jun is phosphorylated on serine and threonine at five sites, three of which are phosphorylated in vitro by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK 3). These three sites are nested within a single tryptic peptide located just upstream of the basic region of the c-Jun DNA-binding domain (residues 227–252). Activation of protein kinase C results in rapid, site-specific dephosphorylation of c-Jun at one or more of these three sites and is coincident with increased AP-1-binding activity. Phosphorylation of recombinant human c-Jun proteins in vitro by GSK-3 decreases their DNA-binding activity. Mutation of serine 243 to phenylalanine blocks phosphorylation of all three sites in vivo and increases the inherent trans-activation ability of c-Jun at least 10-fold. We propose that c-Jun is present in resting cells in a latent, phosphorylated form that can be activated by site-specific dephosphorylation in response to protein kinase C activation."
https://openalex.org/W2090575139,"The hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by phospholipase C yields the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol. This activity is regulated by a variety of hormones through G protein pathways. However, the specific G protein or proteins involved has not been identified. The alpha subunit of a newly discovered pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein (Gq) has recently been isolated and is now shown to stimulate the activity of polyphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from bovine brain. Both the maximal activity and the affinity of PI-PLC for calcium ion were affected. These results identify Gq as a G protein that regulates PI-PLC."
https://openalex.org/W2020657021,"Stage 0 sporulation (spo0) mutants of Bacillus subtilis are defective in the signal transduction system initiating sporulation. Two of the products of these genes, Spo0A and Spo0F, are related to response regulator components of two-component regulatory systems used to control environmental responses in bacteria. The Spo0F response regulator was found to be the primary substrate for phosphorylation by the sporulation-specific protein kinase, KinA. Phosphorylated Spo0F was the phosphodonor for a phosphotransferase, Spo0B, which transferred the phosphate group to the second response regulator, the transcription regulatory protein Spo0A. This phosphorelay provides a mechanism for signal gathering from several protein kinases using Spo0F as a secondary messenger. These divergent signals are integrated through Spo0B phosphotransferase to activate the Spo0A transcription factor. This system provides for many levels of control to prevent capricious induction of sporulation."

https://openalex.org/W1611413521,"The cellular receptor for human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PAR) is shown by several independent criteria to be a true member of a family of integral membrane proteins, anchored to the plasma membrane exclusively by a COOH-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol moiety. 1) Amino acid analysis of u-PAR after micropurification by affinity chromatography and N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of 2-3 mol of ethanolamine/mol protein. 2) Membrane-bound u-PAR is efficiently released from the surface of human U937 cells by trace amounts of purified bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. This soluble form of u-PAR retains the binding specificity toward both u-PA and its amino-terminal fragment holding the receptor-binding domain. 3) Treatment of purified u-PAR with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C or mild alkali completely alters the hydrophobic properties of the receptor as judged by temperature-induced detergent-phase separation and charge-shift electrophoresis. 4) Biosynthetic labeling of u-PAR was obtained with [3H]ethanolamine and myo-[3H]inositol. 5) Finally, comparison of amino acid compositions derived from cDNA sequence and amino acid analysis shows that a polypeptide of medium hydrophobicity is excised from the COOH terminus of the nascent u-PAR. A similar proteolytic processing has been reported for other proteins that are linked to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor."
https://openalex.org/W1659985814,"Serum levels of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity have been shown to be elevated in cases of septic shock and rheumatoid arthritis. The cellular origin of serum PLA2, however, is not known. In this report, we demonstrate that human group II PLA2 expression and secretion are induced in hepatoma cells (HepG2) following treatment with interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-1 (IL-1). Of the three cytokines, IL-6 is the most potent. Significant synergy is observed between IL-6 and IL-1 and between IL-6 and TNF, but not between IL-1 and TNF. PLA2 induction does not occur in human YT cells, which are known to have receptors for both IL-1 and IL-6, indicating that the regulatory mechanism involved is cell type-specific. The results of RNA blot analysis indicate that the PLA2 gene is regulated in HepG2 cells at the pretranslational level. Induction of PLA2 synthesis in HepG2 cells in response to these cytokines resembles the induction of the acute phase plasma proteins which are synthesized in cultured hepatocytes and hepatoma cells following exposure to the same cytokines and in liver in response to inflammation and infection. In addition, a putative IL-6-responsive element, which is homologous to a similar element found in several acute phase genes, is present in the 5'-promoter-proximal region of the PLA2 gene. These results suggest that serum PLA2 is synthesized in and secreted from liver cells in response to inflammatory stimuli, mediated primarily by IL-6, and therefore should be classified as an acute phase protein."

https://openalex.org/W1522564556,"This study examines the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in connective tissue metabolism. Effects of different preparations of IL-6 on production of collagenase and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1/erythroid potentiating activity production are studied in human fibroblasts, synoviocytes, and articular chondrocytes. In contrast to interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), IL-6 does not stimulate the production of collagenase, nor does it modulate the stimulatory effects of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha on the production of this proteinase. Furthermore, IL-6 has no detectable effect on prostaglandin E2 production, an additional proinflammatory response induced by IL-1 beta and TNF alpha. IL-6, however, is identified as a potent inducer of de novo synthesis of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1/erythroid potentiating activity in all types of connective tissue cells examined. These results define new biological activities of IL-6 and provide further insight into the regulation of connective tissues by cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1556814137,"There is evidence that myocardial injury, as would occur on post-ischemic reperfusion, may be caused by the generation of oxygen radicals, as well as by the induction of intracellular calcium overload; however, the relationship between these two mechanisms of injury is not known. To test the hypothesis that oxidants and oxygen radicals can cause cardiac myocyte injury and intracellular calcium overload, isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes were exposed to H2O2 (1-10 mM) and Fe3(+)-nitrilotriacetate. EPR measurements confirmed the production of the highly reactive .OH radical by this system. The oxygen radical generating system initially caused a transient augmentation of twitch amplitude in single field stimulated myocytes. This was followed by contractile oscillations occurring during the twitch prior to full cell relaxation, and spontaneous mechanical oscillations occurring between electrically stimulated contractions. Eventually, cells became inexcitable and abruptly underwent contracture. In the presence of lower bathing calcium concentrations, these oxidant-induced alterations were prevented or delayed. However, cells exposed to the radical generating system in the absence of extracellular calcium still eventually underwent contracture but stimulated contractions or mechanical oscillations were not seen. Measurements in single myocytes loaded with the fluorescent probe of intracellular calcium, Indo-1, demonstrated a rise in both systolic and diastolic fluorescence ratio, as well as oscillations and widening of the fluorescence transient, suggestive of cellular calcium loading, following exposure to the radical generating system. Injured myocytes did not take up trypan blue dye. Contractile dysfunction and calcium channel blocker, nitrendipine. NMR measurements of cellular [ATP] demonstrated that these alterations in cellular calcium preceded the depletion of ATP. Subsequent depletion of ATP was accompanied by the appearance of increased concentrations of sugar phosphates indicative of a block in glycolysis and ATP depletion correlated with cellular rigor. Thus, oxygen free radicals can cause cardiac myocyte injury with contractile abnormalities which occur due to myocyte calcium loading. The mechanism of oxidant-induced calcium loading is not due to nonspecific membrane damage, or energy depletion, but rather due to increased calcium influx through voltage gated calcium channels. This early calcium overload state as well as oxidant induced block of glycolysis result in cellular energy depletion and cell death with the induction of contracture."

https://openalex.org/W2021207168,"Steroid hormones induce transcription from the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter by complex mechanisms requiring binding of the hormone receptors to the hormone responsive element (HRE) of the long terminal repeat region. Here we show that the MMTV promoter contains two degenerated octamer motifs immediately upstream of the TATA box that together bind OTF-1 (Oct-1, NFIII) with an affinity similar to the octamer consensus. In transfection experiments, mutation of these octamer motifs interferes with the hormonal response of the MMTV promoter. In vitro, these mutations do not influence basal transcription but completely abolish the stimulatory effect of purified progesterone receptor. Progesterone receptor and glucocorticoid receptor bound to the HRE facilitate binding of OTF-1 to the two octamer motifs. Thus, OTF-1 is a natural mediator of hormonal induction of the MMTV promoter and acts through cooperation with the hormone receptors for binding to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2018198144,"In the medullary segment of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (mTALH), arachidonic acid (AA) is metabolized by a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase to products that affect ion transport. The linkage between changes in ion transport and AA metabolism in isolated cells of the mTALH was examined. AA produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of 86Rb uptake--an effect that was prevented by selective blockade of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. Inhibition by cytochrome P450 blockade of the effect of AA on 86Rb uptake could be circumvented by addition of the principal products of AA metabolism in the mTALH."
https://openalex.org/W1507489795,"We report here the purification and characterization of phosphomannose isomerase-guanosine 5‘-diphospho-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase, a bifunctional enzyme (PMI-GMP) which catalyzes both the phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) and guanosine 5‘-diphospho-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMP) reactions of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa alginate biosynthetic pathway. The PMI and GMP activities co-eluted in the same protein peak through successive fractionation on hydrophobic interaction, ion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. The purified enzyme migrated as a 56,000 molecular weight protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the native protein migrated as a monomer of 54,000 molecular weight upon gel filtration chromatography. The apparent Km for D-mannose 6-phosphate was 3.03 mM, and the Vmax was 830 nmol/min/mg of enzyme. For the GMP forward reaction, apparent Km values of 20.5 microM and 29.5 microM for D-mannose 1-phosphate and GTP, respectively, were obtained from double reciprocal plots. The GMP forward reaction Vmax (5,680 nmol/min/mg of enzyme) was comparable to the reverse reaction Vmax (5,170 nmol/min/mg of enzyme), and the apparent Km for GDP-D-mannose was determined to be 14.2 microM. Both reactions required Mg2+ activation, but the PMI reaction rate was 4-fold higher with Co2+ as the activator. PMI (but not GMP) activity was sensitive to dithiothreitol, indicating the involvement of disulfide bonds to form a protein structure capable of PMI activity. DNA sequencing of a cloned mutant algA gene from P. aeruginosa revealed that a point mutation at nucleotide 961 greatly decreased the levels of both PMI and GMP in a crude extract."
https://openalex.org/W1561990074,"The reaction of the electrostatic cytochrome c-cytochrome oxidase complex with oxygen is measured by transient absorption spectroscopy. The oxygen reaction is initiated by photolytic removal of CO from cytochrome oxidase, using a flash-pumped dye laser. The subsequent reaction of the cytochrome c-cytochrome oxidase complex with oxygen is reported at 550, 605, 744, and 830 nm at different cytochrome c:cytochrome oxidase ratios and different oxygen concentrations. In the absence of cytochrome c the time course of the reaction of the oxidase is well described by a triple exponential process at any of the measured wavelengths. The three processes are well resolved at high O2 levels (i.e. greater than 200 microM), where they reach first-order rate limits of 2.4 x 10(4), 7.5 x 10(3), and 650 s-1. When cytochrome c is added the oxidation of cytochrome a and one of the redox active cooper centers (CuA) are interrupted. The maximal effect of cytochrome c on the oxidation of the oxidase occurs at a c:aa3 ratio of 1. Cytochrome c reacts in a biphasic process with rates of up to 7 x 10(3) and 550 s-1 at high oxygen. The fast phase takes up 60% of the process, and this is independent of the cytochrome c:cytochrome oxidase ratio. The results are discussed in the context of a model in which electron entry into cytochrome oxidase from cytochrome c is via CuA, and cytochrome a functions to mediate electron transfer from CuA to the oxygen binding site. The role of CuA as initial electron acceptor in cytochrome c oxidase is related to its physical proximity to cytochrome c is the cytochrome c-cytochrome oxidase complex."

The origin binding protein shows DNA-dependent nucleoside 5‘-triphosphatase and DNA helicase activities in addition to its origin binding activity. The ability to hydrolyze nucleoside 5‘-triphosphates is influenced strongly by the structure and sequence of the DNA cofactor. The properties of the recombinant origin binding protein are identical to those of the protein synthesized in herpes simplex 1-infected mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1599606526,"Factor VIII, a cofactor of the intrinsic clotting pathway, is proteolytically inactivated by the vitamin K-dependent serine protease, activated protein C in a reaction requiring Ca2+ and a phospholipid surface. Factor VIII was inactivated 15 times faster than factor VIII in complex with either von Willebrand factor (vWf) or the large homodimeric fragment, SPIII (vWf residues 1-1365). Free factor VIII or factor VIII in complex with a smaller fragment, SPIII-T4 (vWf residues 1-272), were inactivated at the same rate, suggesting that this effect was dependent upon the size of factor VIII-vWf complex rather than changes in factor VIII brought about by occupancy of the vWf-binding site. Thrombin cleavage of the factor VIII light chain to remove the vWf-binding site eliminated the protective effects of vWf. In the absence of phospholipid, high levels of the protease inactivated both free and vWf-bound factor VIII at equivalent rates. Using the same conditions, isolated heavy chains and the heavy chains of factor VIII were proteolyzed at similar rates. Taken together, these results suggested that, in the absence of phospholipid, inactivation of factor VIII is independent of factor VIII light chain and further suggest that vWf did not mask susceptible cleavage sites in the cofactor. Solution studies employing fluorescence energy transfer using coumarin-labeled factor VIII (fluorescence donor) and synthetic phospholipid vesicles labeled with octadecyl rhodamine (fluorescence acceptor) indicated saturable binding and equivalent extents of donor fluorescence quenching for factor VIII alone or when complexed with SPIII-T4. However, complexing of factor VIII with either vWf or SPIII eliminated its binding to the phospholipid. Since a phospholipid surface is required for efficient catalysis by the protease, these results suggest that vWf protects factor VIII by inhibiting cofactor-phospholipid interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1483085618,"Cytotoxic effects and topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks induced in vitro by ellipticine derivatives were examined in connection with 1H NMR and circular dichroism (CD) studies on molecular structures and interactions of drugs with DNA. The compounds included four 9-hydroxyellipticine and two 7-hydroxyisoellipticine derivatives. Structure-activity relationships indicated that a change in nitrogen atom position in the pyridinic ring greatly affected drug effects both on topoisomerase II action and cytotoxicity to L1210 cells. The four 9-hydroxyellipticine derivatives yielded bell-shaped curves in in vitro topoisomerase II-mediated DNA break assays, whereas the two 7-hydroxyisoellipticine derivatives demonstrated an almost linear increase at the same concentration (0-10 microM). In both cases, the intensity of cleavage was modulated by the position and the degree of methylation on the pyridinic ring, and results were correlated with cytotoxic activity expressed as the in vitro ID50 values for L1210 leukemia cells. 1H NMR experiments performed on free drug molecules in solution revealed that the two protons (alpha and beta) contiguous to the biologically important hydroxy group were sensitive to changes in electron distribution produced by the distant chemical modifications and methylations of the pyridinic ring. A linear relationship was observed between the differences in chemical shifts of alpha and beta protons (delta delta alpha-beta) versus ID50 values. CD experiments indicated that, at weak ionic strength I = 0.02 and at pH 7, drugs interact with the poly[d(A-T)] duplex according to a three-mode binding model which is governed by the drug structure and the drug to DNA ratio. The intercalation mode was related to the induction of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage, while the external binding mode consecutive to intercalation was related to cleavage suppression. These two modes concerned the good intercalators 9-hydroxyellipticines. The third was found for the weak intercalators 7-hydroxyisoellipticines and was characterized by self-stacked molecules bound outside DNA, presumably in the minor groove. Ligands either could be intercalated partially or linked at the edge of bases with a small number of molecules filling intercalation sites, for the second alternative. In addition to having different binding modes, 9-hydroxyellipticines were better inducers of DNA distortions than 7-hydroxyisoellipticines. The incidence of the drug binding modes on DNA-topoisomerase II recognition was discussed in connection with the in vitro cytotoxic activity exhibited by the drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1601486233,"Our previous study indicated that nuclear protein factors of HeLa cells specifically bind to three nuclear Mt elements, Mt1, Mt3, and Mt4, located in the 5'-flanking regions of the human nuclear genes for cytochrome c1 and for ubiquinone-binding protein, both of which are subunits of mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex (Suzuki, H., Hosokawa, Y., Toda, H., Nishikimi, M., and Ozawa, T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8159-8163). In this study, we examined whether the same nuclear factors could recognize a set of the Mt3 and Mt4 elements that were found in the displacement loop and the promoter region of mammalian mitochondrial genomes. Gel retardation experiments disclosed that the same nuclear protein factors specifically bind to those Mt elements in the human mitochondrial genome as well as to the nuclear Mt3 and Mt4 elements of the two genes, and that the coexistence of both the elements is required for the efficient binding. The nuclear protein factors which recognize the Mt elements located in the regulatory regions of the nuclear and mitochondrial genes may play an important role in coordinate expression of the two physically separated genes during mitochondrial biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1572691953,"The effect of ethanol on receptor-mediated phospholipase C-linked signal transduction processes was investigated in isolated rat hepatocytes. Pretreatment of the cells with ethanol (6-300 mM) markedly inhibited a subsequent stimulation of phospholipase C by vasopressin, angiotensin II, or epidermal growth factor. By contrast, the effects of the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine and of glucagon were not affected by ethanol pretreatment. Ethanol inhibited the agonist-induced decrease in polyphosphoinositides, the formation of inositol phosphates, and the increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ levels, as detected with the intracellular Ca2+ indicator indo-1. The effects of ethanol were concentration dependent and were pronounced at low concentrations of agonists but were not significant at saturating levels. Pretreatment of the cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor H7 partly prevented the inhibition by ethanol of vasopressin-induced phospholipase C activation. By contrast, pretreatment of the cells with (Rp)-adenosine cyclic 3‘:5‘-phosphorothioate [Rp)-cAMP-S), a competitive inhibitor of protein kinase A, potentiated the inhibitory effect of ethanol on the Ca2+ mobilization by vasopressin. (Rp)-cAMP-S similarly potentiated the inhibition of phospholipase C by the protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The kinase A inhibitor also made the Ca2+ mobilization by phenylephrine sensitive to ethanol, indicating that the formation of cAMP in the cells played a role in suppressing the sensitivity to ethanol. Pretreatment of the cells with ethanol enhanced the inhibitory effects of TPA on the vasopressin-induced phospholipase C activation at all concentrations of the hormone; however, these synergistic effects were prevented when TPA was added prior to ethanol, a condition that prevents the activation of phospholipase C by ethanol. The data indicate that ethanol causes desensitization of the receptor-mediated phospholipase C secondary to the ethanol-induced activation of phospholipase C and activation of protein kinase C. Ethanol treatment also affects the sensitivity of the phospholipase C system to control by protein kinases A and C. The data indicate that ethanol can affect the control of intracellular signal transduction processes in liver cells under physiologically relevant conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1514546358,"Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is a metabolite of NAD+ which is as active as inositol trisphosphate (IP3) in mobilizing intracellular Ca2+ in sea urchin eggs. The enzyme responsible for synthesizing cADPR is found not only in sea urchin eggs but also in various mammalian tissue extracts, suggesting that it may be a general messenger for Ca2+ mobilization in cells. In this study I address questions of whether an intracellular receptor for cADPR exists and, if so, whether it is different from the IP3 receptor. A procedure employing nitrogen decompression was used to homogenize sea urchin eggs, and the Ca2(+)-storing microsomes were separated from mitochondria and other organelles by Percoll density centrifugation. Radioactive cADPR with high specific activity was produced by incubating [32P]NAD+ with the synthesizing enzyme and the product purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. The enzyme was membrane bound and was isolated from dog brain extracts by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Partial purification of the enzyme was achieved by DEAE ion-exchange chromatography after solubilization with 3-[(cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate. Specific binding of 32P-labeled cADPR to a saturable site on the Ca2(+)-storing microsomes was detected by a filtration assay. Scatchard analysis indicated a binding affinity of about 17 nM and a capacity of about 25 fmol/mg protein. The binding was not affected by either NAD+ (the precursor) or ADP-ribose (the hydrolysis product) at 0.5 microM but was eliminated by 0.3 microM nonlabeled cADPR. The receptor for cADPR appeared to be different from that of IP3 since IP3 was not an effective competitor at a concentration as high as 3 microM. Similarly, heparin at a concentration that inhibits most of the IP3-induced calcium release from the microsomes did not affect the binding. The binding showed a prominent pH optimum at about 6.7. Calcium at 40 microM decreased the binding by about 50%. These dependencies of the binding on pH and Ca2+ are different from those reported for the IP3 receptor and provide further support that the intracellular receptors for cADPR and IP3 are different."
https://openalex.org/W1546670130,"Abstract Stimulation of DDT1 MF-2 vas deferens cells with epinephrine resulted in a time- and dose-dependent loss of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-specific ligand binding. Regulation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA was characterized. In monolayer culture, cells displayed 0.7 +/- 0.05 amol of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA/microgram of total cellular RNA. Epinephrine, which acts at both alpha 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors of DDT1 MF-2 cells, induced a short term (2-8 h) increase (50-70%) in the abundance of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA. Propranolol, a beta 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, attenuated the epinephrine-mediated increase in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA but did not affect the decrease in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-specific ligand binding. Phentolamine, an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, did not attenuate the epinephrine-mediated increase in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA at 4 h but did block the decrease in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-specific ligand binding. The half-life of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA was approximately 7 h in untreated cells as well as in cells challenged with epinephrine. The epinephrine-promoted increase in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA was found to result from cross-regulation via beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Cholera toxin, forskolin, as well as the cyclic AMP analog CPT cAMP (8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate) increased the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA at 4 h, as did epinephrine in the presence of alpha 1-antagonists but not in the presence of a beta-adrenergic antagonist. This is the first report of heterologous up-regulation of mRNA levels of adrenergic receptors. Cross-regulation between alpha 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated pathways at 4 h occurs at the level of mRNA whereas later down-regulation of alpha 1-receptor mRNA and binding proceed via agonist activation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1572714473,"The resonance Raman spectra of neutrophil cytochrome b558 obtained upon Soret excitation indicate that the heme is low spin six-coordinate in both ferric and ferrous oxidation states; comparison with the spectra of bis-imidazole hemin suggests imidazole or imidazolate axial ligation. Minor bands attributable to vibrational motions of ring-conjugated vinyl substituents were also observed, consistent with a heme assignment of protoporphyrin IX. The spectra of deoxycholate-solubilized cytochrome b558 were indistinguishable from neutrophil plasma membranes or specific granules, as were spectra from unstimulated and phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated cells, indicating that the hemes are structurally identical in various subcellular environments and cellular physiological states. However, structural complexity was suggested by biphasic ferric-ferrous photoreduction under 413-nm illumination and the absence of an EPR spectrum for the ferric heme under conditions where simple bis-imidazole heme-containing cytochromes are expected to give detectable signals. Midpoint reduction potentials and resonance Raman spectra of the soluble cytochrome b558 from an individual with cytochrome b558 positive (type IA.2) chronic granulomatous disease were nearly identical to normal oxidase, with the exception that the deficient oxidase did not undergo heme photoreduction. Possible structural models are discussed in relation to other physical properties (ligand binding, thermodynamic potentials) exhibited by the cytochrome."
https://openalex.org/W1527502821,"Mesangial cells are thought to play a central role in the renal complications of diabetes mellitus. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) has been found to promote mesangial cell proliferation and regulate normal mesangial cell function in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion. To gain further insight into the potential regulatory role IGF-I may play in mesangial cell function in diabetes, IGF-I receptors were analyzed in mesangial cells isolated from diabetic mice (db/db) and their control littermates (db/m). Mesangial cells isolated from db/db mice exhibited higher levels of IGF-I receptors compared to cells from db/m mice. Insulin receptors were not detectable in either cell type by binding analyses; however, immunoblot analysis revealed insulin receptor alpha-subunits in wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose-purified membranes from db/db cells. Northern blot analysis further indicated a lack of detectable insulin receptor mRNA in db/m cells, whereas db/db cells expressed multiple insulin receptor mRNA transcripts. Both IGF-I and insulin receptor mRNA levels were increased in db/db cells grown in the presence of high glucose (28 mM), whereas the receptor protein levels remained relatively constant or increased, respectively. This increased expression of IGF-I and insulin receptors in diabetic mesangial cells may have an important role in the development of diabetic nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W1536310816,"Predictive and spectroscopic methods were used to develop a model of the structures of the 1-34 peptides of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the PTH-related protein (PTHrP). Circular dichroism (CD) studies of bovine PTH-(1-34) and human PTHrP-(1-34)amide in the presence of trifluoroethanol suggest the presence of 24-26 alpha-helical residues. For both peptides, interactions between amino- and carboxyl-region alpha-helices are predicted to result in a hydrophobic core with externally facing hydrophilic residues that include probable determinants of receptor binding and activation. Two such residues, Ser3 and Gln6, are conserved in all known members of the PTH/PTHrP family. We have synthesized 13 novel analogues of bovine PTH-(1-34) monosubstituted at positions 3 and 6 and have determined their biological activities in renal and bone cell radioreceptor and adenylyl cyclase assays. Position 3 analogues displayed biological activity that was reduced in direct proportion to the volume of the substituent side-chain. Position 6 analogues also displayed reduced biological activity, but no simple correlation with side-chain volume or hydrophobicity was evident. The analogues fully displaced labeled PTH from binding sites in renal membranes and bone cells, but [Phe3]bPTH-(1-34), [Tyr3]bPTH-(1-34), [Phe6] bPTH-(1-34), and [Ser6]bPTH-(1-34) were only partial agonists in one or both adenylyl cyclase assays. Of these, [Phe3]bPTH-(1-34) and [Phe6]bPTH-(1-34) were tested for antagonist activity and were found to inhibit the activation of adenylyl cyclase in response to bPTH-(1-34) or hPTHrP-(1-34)amide. These results indicate that positions 3 and 6 contribute important determinants of PTH receptor binding and activation. Modification at these positions represents a novel approach to the development of antagonists of PTH action."
https://openalex.org/W1539946166,"Cleavage of linear duplex DNA by purified vaccinia virus DNA topoisomerase I occurs at a conserved sequence element (5'-C/T)CCTT decreases) in the incised DNA strand. Oligonucleotides spanning the high affinity cleavage site CCCTT at nucleotide 2457 in pUC19 DNA are cleaved efficiently in vitro, but only when hybridized to a complementary DNA molecule. As few as 6 nucleotides proximal to the cleavage site and 6 nucleotides downstream of the site are sufficient to support exclusive cleavage at the high affinity site (position +1). Single nucleotide substitutions within the consensus pentamer have deleterious effects on the equilibria of the topoisomerase binding and DNA cleavage reactions. The effects of base mismatch within the pentamer are more dramatic than are the effects of mutations that preserve base complementarity. Competition experiments indicate that topoisomerase binds preferentially to DNA sites containing the wild-type pentamer element.

Although related in a precursor-product manner, the mechanism of conversion and the basis for differences between M-FBP and S-FBP are not known. The conversion of M-FBP to S-FBP in crude human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (KB) cell preparations is demonstrated based on characteristic gel filtration elution profiles of M-FBP and S-FBP (Ve/V0 = 1.3 and 1.7, respectively) in Triton X-100. M-FBP is stoichiometrically converted to S-FBP in a time- and temperature-dependent reaction by a metalloprotease which is: heat-labile; particulate; contained in human KB cell and placental membranes, and rat kidney homogenates; inhibited by EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline, and parahydroxymercuribenzoate; requires divalent cations; is maximally active at neutral pH; and is active in the presence or absence of detergent. The purified soluble FBP product appears to be identical to S-FBP. Conversion of purified endogenously [3H]leucine-labeled M-FBP yields a soluble FBP characterized by a 45% decrease in specific activity (moles of 3H/mol folate bound) relative to M-FBP and a non-folate binding fragment which contains 45% of the [3H]leucine from M-FBP, requires detergent and/or urea to remain soluble, and migrates aberrantly on gel filtration in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 8 M urea. Based on changes in the specific activity and the gel filtration elution profiles of purified labeled M-FBP associated with conversion to S-FBP, the endoproteolytic cleavage site is predicted between residues 226 and 229 of the cDNA predicted human FBP amino acid sequence. These results suggest that the cDNA predicted hydrophobic carboxyl terminus (residues 227-257) remains intact on the fully processed, membrane-anchored M-FBP, contains the Triton binding domain, and is involved in the formation of the membrane anchor of M-FBP."

https://openalex.org/W1515861746,"The effect of okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases-1 and -2A, was studied on glucose transport and metabolism in soleus muscles isolated from lean and insulin-resistant obese mice. In muscles from lean mice, the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose, an index of glucose transport and phosphorylation, was increased by okadaic acid in a concentration-dependent manner. At 5 microM, okadaic acid was as efficient as a maximally effective insulin concentration. Glucose metabolism (glycolysis and glycogen synthesis) was also measured. Whereas glycolysis was stimulated by okadaic acid, glycogen synthesis was unchanged. When okadaic acid and insulin were added together in the incubation medium, the rates of glucose transport, glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis were similar to those obtained with insulin alone, whether maximal or submaximal insulin concentrations were used. Furthermore, okadaic acid did not activate the kinase activity of the insulin receptor studied in an acellular system or in intact muscles. These results indicate that a step in the insulin-induced stimulation of muscle glucose transport involves a serine/threonine phosphorylation event that is regulated by protein phosphatases-1 and/or -2A. In muscles of insulin-resistant obese mice, the absolute values of deoxyglucose uptake stimulated by okadaic acid were lower than in muscles from lean mice. However, the okadaic acid effect, expressed as a fold stimulation, was normal. These observations suggest that in the insulin-resistant state linked to obesity, the serine/threonine phosphorylation event is likely occurring normally, but a defect at the level of the glucose transporter itself would prevent a normal response to insulin or okadaic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1532399000,"Casein kinase I activity is present in cells as a cytosolic and a membrane-bound enzyme. Previously, the erythroid membrane-bound casein kinase I was shown to associate with purified integral membrane proteins; this association and protein kinase activity was regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (Bazenet, C.E., Brockman, J.L., Lewis, D., Chan, C., and Anderson, R.A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7369-7376). Here we show that both the membrane-bound and the cytosolic casein kinase interact with native membranes and that this interaction is regulated by the membrane content of PIP2. On native membranes, casein kinase I activity is potently inhibited by small increases (10-20%) in the membrane content of either exogenously added or intrinsic PIP2. However, the majority of the intrinsic content of PIP2 in isolated membranes does not inhibit casein kinase, suggesting that this PIP2 is not accessible. Regulation of the casein kinases on membranes is sensitive to detergents and to chymotrypsin treatment of membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1650815595,"The gene encoding rat fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was isolated from a rat genomic Charon 4A library by screening with a cDNA to the rat liver enzyme. Southern blotting of rat genomic DNA showed that there is a single copy of the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene. It extends over 23 kilobases and is composed of seven exons and six introns that range in size from 93 to 267 base pairs and from 1,400 to 11,300 base pairs, respectively. The intron/exon boundary sequences conform to consensus acceptor (GTn) and donor (nAG) sequences, and the exons in the gene appear to code for functional protein domains. The transcription start site, determined by 5'-extension sequencing of mRNA, was assigned to a guanine 119 bases 5' to the translation initiation AUG. The sequence of the gene upstream to the cap site contains characteristic RNA polymerase II promoter-binding sites: a putative TATA box at position -29 and a Sp 1 binding site (GGGGCGGAGA) at position -48. A 1,300-base pair fragment of 5'-flanking sequence containing these elements, ligated upstream from a firefly luciferase reporter gene and transfected into cultured normal rat kidney cells, demonstrated strong promoter activity. The accumulation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase mRNA in hepatocytes incubated with cAMP suggests that the gene may be cAMP-responsive, which is consistent with the presence of three consensus cAMP regulatory elements at positions -169, -282, and -698 in the 5'-flanking region of the gene. Expression of the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase promoter-driven luciferaes gene was 2-3-fold activated by the cyclic nucleotide, suggesting that one or more of these elements may be functional. On the other hand, insulin decreased the expression of the endogenous gene in hepatocytes. Thus, expression of the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene is regulated independently by both cAMP and insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1524142560,"The influence of topoisomerase I and gyrase mutations in Escherichia coli on the supercoiled density of recombinant plasmids and the stability of left-handed Z-DNA was investigated. The formation of Z-DNA in vivo by dC-dG sequences of different lengths was used to determine the effective plasmid supercoil densities in the mutant strains. The presence of Z-DNA in the cells was detected by linking number and EcoRI methylase inhibition assays. A change in the unrestrained superhelical tension in vivo directly effects the B- to Z-DNA transition. Alterations in the internal or external environment of the cells, such as the inactivation of gyrase or topoisomerase I, a gyrase temperature-sensitive mutant, or starvation of cells, have a dramatic influence on the topology of plasmids. Also, E. coli has significantly more superhelical strain than Klebsiella, Morganella, or Enterobacter. These studies indicate that linking deficiency and effective supercoil density are mutually independent variables of plasmid tertiary structure. A variety of factors, such as protein-DNA interactions, activity of topoisomerases, and the resulting supercoil density, contribute to the B to Z transition inside living cells."
https://openalex.org/W1639095485,"A panel of 24 IgG2ak monoclonal antibodies was produced against murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3)-induced procoagulant activity (PCA) from murine macrophages. The antibodies were specific and did not react in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with purified MHV-3; lipopolysaccharide-induced PCA; crude mouse, human, or rabbit tissue factor, or unstimulated murine macrophages. Sixteen of 24 monoclonal antibodies inhibited functional PCA expression in a one-stage clotting assay. More detailed studies on one monoclonal antibody, 3D4.3, demonstrated that it inhibited prothrombin cleavage at concentrations of greater than or equal to 0.1 microgram/ml, and by Western blot this antibody reacted with proteins of a molecular mass of 140, 74, and 70 kDa on nonreduced gels and 74 and 70 kDa on reduced gels distinct from tissue factor known to have a molecular mass of 47 kDa. Induction of PCA was dependent on both host RNA and protein synthesis. Immunofluorescence studies showed specific binding to MHV-3-stimulated PCA-positive macrophage membranes. Both numbers of positive macrophages and intensity of staining correlated with multiplicity of infection. These monoclonal antibodies will be useful in isolation and characterization of the unique viral-induced PCA as well as in determining its biologic role in MHV infection and other diseases in which the prothrombinase has been implicated."
https://openalex.org/W1535056438,"Regulation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump in the cell is of critical importance in maintaining calcium homeostasis. Since protein kinase C is known to regulate functions of cellular proteins by direct phosphorylation or by inducing their gene expression, we investigated the possible involvement of protein kinase C in the regulation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump. The Ca2+ pump was isolated by immunoprecipitation from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cultured rat aortic endothelial cells grown in the absence or presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of protein kinase C. PMA treatment of cells led to a rapid increase in the phosphorylation level (1.3-fold) within 5 min and a further increase to 2.9-fold after 3 h. Prolonged PMA treatment also induced the accumulation of the Ca2+ pump mRNA, followed by increased levels of the pump protein. The peak level of the pump mRNA induction occurred at 4 h and was 8-20-fold higher than the control culture without PMA. The rate of the Ca2+ pump protein accumulation was slower, reaching a maximum of 3.5-fold after 6 h. Induction of the pump mRNA was suppressed by the protein kinase C inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine and by down-regulation of protein kinase C. Inactive phorbol ester 4 alpha-phorbol didecanoate also failed to mimic the PMA effect. These results suggest that the induction of Ca2+ pump expression is mediated by a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, since the induction of the Ca2+ pump mRNA was blocked when cycloheximide and PMA were added together, this suggests that newly synthesized protein factor is needed to produce the mRNA induction. Our results suggest that protein kinase C is involved in the regulation of the Ca2+ pump in endothelial cells. At the protein level, it modifies the Ca2+ pump by phosphorylation, and at the gene level, it stimulates the expression of its mRNA and thereby increases the amount of the pump protein."
https://openalex.org/W1601592083,"Alpha 1-Adrenergic receptors and bradykinin receptors are two distinct membrane receptors that stimulate phospholipid breakdown and arachidonic acid and arachidonic acid metabolite release. In the current studies, we have examined several mechanisms to assess their possible contribution to arachidonic acid release in the Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line by agonist stimulation of these receptors: 1) activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2); 2) sequential activation of phospholipase C, diacylglycerol lipase, and monoacylglycerol lipase; and 3) inhibition of the sequential action of fatty acyl-CoA synthetase and lysophosphatide acyltransferase. Experiments were conducted to measure the stimulation of lysophospholipid production by epinephrine and bradykinin, the rate of incorporation of [3H]arachidonic acid into stimulated and unstimulated cells, and the effect on [3H]arachidonic acid release of treating cells with exogenous phospholipase C. The data indicate that stimulation of PLA2 activity is regulated by alpha 1-adrenergic and bradykinin receptors and that this stimulation is mediated, at least in part, by the activation of protein kinase C. We find that the role of diacylglycerol in arachidonic acid release is as an activator of protein kinase C and not as a substrate for a lipase. Moreover, the hormonal agonists do not appear to inhibit fatty acid reacylation. Experiments using the Ca2(+)-sensitive dye fura-2 and the intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid suggest that bradykinin activates PLA2 by a transient elevation of intracellular Ca2+. This action appears to be less important for activation of PLA2 by epinephrine. Taken together, these data are consistent with the following conclusions. 1) Hormone-stimulated arachidonic acid release in Madin-Darby canine kidney-D1 cells occurs as a consequence of PLA2 activation. 2) The ability of an agonist both to mobilize Ca2+ and to activate protein kinase C contributes to its efficacy as a stimulator of PLA2-mediated arachidonic acid release."
https://openalex.org/W1526429874,"C6 rat glioma cells were investigated for a shared unidirectional efflux system for cAMP and cholate. [3H]Cholate was accumulated (at pH 7.3) by scraped C6 cell monolayers via a process which was rapid initially and then slowed to a steady state after 10 min at 37 degrees C. Release of the accumulated label was also rapid (t1/2 = 2 min), was essentially complete within 15 min, and exhibited energy dependence since it could be blocked by antimycin A. Half-maximal inhibition by antimycin A occurred at 0.87 microM, and maximal inhibition exceeded 90%. Various other compounds also inhibited [3H]cholate efflux. The most effective was prostaglandin A1, which reduced efflux half-maximally at a concentration of 0.14 microM. Other inhibitors, prostaglandin B1, verapamil, probenecid, and bromosulfophathalein, produced half-maximal inhibition at 5.3, 42, 78, and 110 microM, respectively. Cholate efflux was also blocked by 40 microM vincristine. Initial influx of [3H]cholate was not affected by antimycin A, prostaglandin A1, or vincristine and hence was attributed to a process separate from efflux. C6 rat glioma cells also have the ability to produce high intracellular levels of cAMP in response to isoproterenol and to release cAMP into the medium via a carrier-mediated efflux system. When measured under the same conditions employed for cholate efflux, the efflux of cAMP was found to be sensitive to each of the inhibitors of cholate efflux. Moreover, plots of cAMP efflux versus varying concentrations of prostaglandin A1, antimycin A, prostaglandin B1, verapamil, and probenecid showed similar response curves and comparable values for half-maximal These results indicate that C6 rat glioma cells contain a unidirectional efflux pump for cholate and that this same system also appears to mediate the unidirectional efflux of cAMP. These findings support the hypothesis that various cells contain efflux pumps which exhibit a broad specificity for large organic anions of diverse structure and that the function of these efflux pumps resides primarily in cellular anion detoxification. Analogous efflux pumps for hydrophobic drugs are overproduced in tumor cells exhibiting multidrug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1905749088,"The reaction of the glutathione transferase from human placenta with a maleimide spin label derivative has been followed by EPR. Incubation of the enzyme at pH 7.0 with 50-fold molar excess of the spin label reagent gives rise to an immobilized nitroxyl EPR spectrum indicative of two reacting thiol groups per dimer of enzyme as evaluated by double integration of the EPR spectrum; the activity is lost in parallel. The same type of spectrum can be obtained simply by adding 2 eq of the spin label reagent to the enzyme. The binding is completed after less than 1 min at pH 8.0; it requires 2 min at pH 7.0 and more than 10 min at pH 6.0. These data indicate that the maleimide derivative reacts, in each subunit, with a thiol group which plays a crucial role for the maintenance of the catalytic activity and is characterized by a low pK. Inactivation of the enzyme at pH 7.0 in the presence of 2 eq of spin label reagent per mol of enzyme requires 15 min, suggesting the occurrence of a structural rearrangement after the binding of the thiol blocking agent. The same binding in the presence of S-methylglutathione or protoporphyrin IX shows a decreased reaction rate with respect to the reaction in the absence of inhibitors, indicating that the thiols are in proximity of both the glutathione and the porphyrin binding sites. For this latter case, this is unambiguously demonstrated by the titration of spin-labeled enzyme with hemin, which produces a decrease of the EPR signal amplitude from which an interspin distance of about 10 A can be evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W1562543361,"Primary cultures of rat renal inner medullary collecting duct cells were grown to confluence on glass coverslips and treated permeant supports, and the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe 2,7-biscarboxyethyl-5,6-carboxyfluorescein was employed to delineate the nature of the transport pathways that allowed for recovery from an imposed acid load in a HCO3-/CO2-buffered solution. The H+ efflux rate of acid-loaded cells was 13.44 +/- 0.94 mM/min. Addition of amiloride, 10(-4) M, to the recovery solution reduced the H+ efflux rate to 4.06 +/- 0.63 mM/min. The amiloride-resistant pHi recovery mechanism displayed an absolute requirement for Na+ but was Cl(-)-independent. Studies performed on permeable supports demonstrated that the latter pathway was located primarily on the basolateral-equivalent (BE) cell surface and was inhibited by 50 microM 4,4‘-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2‘-disulfonic acid (DIDS). In a Na(+)-replete solution containing DIDS (50 microM) and amiloride (10(-4) M), acid-loaded cells failed to return to basal pHi. To delineate further the amiloride-inhibitable component of pHi recovery, monolayers were studied in the nominal absence of HCO3-/CO2. In 70% of monolayers studied, Na(+)-dependent, amiloride-inhibitable H+ efflux was the sole mechanism whereby acid-loaded cells returned to basal pHi. A Na(+)-independent pathway was observed in 30% of monolayers examined and represented only a minor component of the pHi recovery process. In studies performed on permeable supports, the Na(+)-dependent amiloride-inhibitable pathway was found to be confined exclusively to the BE cell surface. In summary, confluent monolayers of rat renal inner medullary collecting duct cells in primary culture possess two major mechanisms that contribute toward recovery from an imposed acid load, namely, Na+/H+ antiport and Na+/HCO3- cotransport. Na(+)-independent pHi recovery mechanisms represent a minor component of the pHi recovery process in the cultured cell. Both the Na+/H+ antiporter and Na+/HCO3- cotransporter are located primarily on the BE cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1511354739,"Alterations in the expression of two proto-oncogenes, c-myb and c-myc, have been implicated in the differentiation of transformed erythroid cells induced by chemical inducers, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). In the present study, we compared the expression of c-myb and c-myc during erythropoietin (Epo) and Me2SO induction of Rauscher erythroleukemia cells, which differentiate in response to both inducers, and Friend erythroleukemia cells, in which Epo-induced differentiation is blocked. Our results demonstrate that Epo induces specific changes in expression of c-myb and c-myc in both Rauscher and Friend cells. Epo increases c-myc transcript, in contrast to a decreased caused Me2SO, indicating that the biphasic mode of c-myc regulation seen with Me2SO is not required for erythropoiesis. The Epo-induced changes in c-myb and c-myc do not require new protein synthesis, thus identifying these proto-oncogenes as early response genes for Epo. Both cell types also exhibit rapid changes in membrane protein phosphorylation in response to Epo. Since the signal pathway from Epo receptor activation to the nucleus appears equally functional in both Rauscher and Friend cells, the data suggest that the inability of Friend cells to differentiate in response to Epo is due to a block at a later step in the induction process."
https://openalex.org/W1649539091,"To determine the physiologically important features of site-specific recombination by Escherichia coli Tn3 resolvase we analyzed the salient properties of the reaction in vivo. A two-plasmid system in which one plasmid served as substrate while the other encoded both resolvase and a thermolabile repressor of resolvase transcription provided controlled, synchronous recombination. Recombination proceeded rapidly and was promoted by (-) DNA supercoiling. The structures of the in vivo recombination products were predominantly the same as those previously identified in vitro. By examination of the products of successive rounds of recombination of a four-site substrate, we ruled out a tracking mechanism for site alignment. Inversion and plasmid fusion occurred in vivo at a much lower rate than resolution but ultimately reached a higher extent than found in vitro. We propose that inversion and fusion exploit topologically interlinked substrates that occur at low levels in vivo. This proposal is supported by the unexpected specificity of fusion. Our data imply that supercoiled DNA, the resolvase synaptic complex, and the mechanism of strand exchange are fundamentally similar in vivo and in vitro, but that the repertoire of resolvase substrates and products is expanded in vivo by the action of other enzymes that alter DNA topology."
https://openalex.org/W1592238953,"Nitrous oxide reductase from Wolinella succinogenes, an enzyme containing one heme c and four Cu atoms/subunit of Mr = 88,000, was studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) at 9.2 GHz from 6 to 80 K. In the oxidized state, low spin ferric cytochrome c was observed with gz = 3.10 and an axial Cu resonance was observed with g parallel = 2.17 and g perpendicular = 2.035. No signals were detected at g values greater than 3.10. For the Cu resonance, six hyperfine lines each were observed in the g parallel and g perpendicular regions with average separations of 45.2 and 26.2 gauss, respectively. The hyperfine components are attributed to Cu(I)-Cu(II) S = 1/2 (half-met) centers. Reduction of the enzyme with dithionite caused signals attributable to heme c and Cu to disappear; exposure of that sample to N2O for a few min caused the reappearance of the g = 3.10 component and a new Cu signal with g parallel = 2.17 and g perpendicular = 2.055 that lacked the simple hyperfine components attributed to a single species of half-met center. The enzyme lost no activity as the result of this cycle of reduction and reoxidation. EPR provided no evidence for a Cu-heme interaction. The EPR detectable Cu in the oxidized and reoxidized forms of the enzyme comprised about 23 and 20% of the total Cu, respectively, or about one spin/subunit. The enzyme offers the first example of a nitrous oxide reductase which can have two states of high activity that present very different EPR spectra of Cu. These two states may represent enzyme in two different stages of the catalytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1490783986,"gamma delta, a member of the Tn3 family of prokaryotic transposons, encodes a transposase that binds to the 35-base pair (bp) terminal inverted repeats (IRs) which define the transposing DNA segment. The gamma delta transposase has been overexpressed, identified by molecular weight determination and by immunoblotting, and purified to homogeneity. Production of soluble transposase required the presence of Mg2+ prior to cell lysis. Fractions from a Sephacryl S-300 column contained levels of IR-binding activity that parallel the concentration of transposase, indicating that transposase alone is sufficient for binding to the ends of gamma delta. Hydroxyl radical footprinting indicated that transposase binds to one face of the DNA helix. The protected region extends across the IR and up to 17 bp into the flanking DNA. Integration host factor (IHF), which binds adjacent to transposase, also protects one face of the DNA helix and is shifted about 70 degrees around the helical axis from the transposase protection. Analysis of transposase-DNA complexes by electrophoresis on nondenaturing gels indicated that three complexes, two within the gel and one trapped at the well, result from specific interactions with the IR. The complex in the well and one complex in the gel were analyzed by methylation interference experiments. The results indicate that transposase interacts with specific base pairs between positions 10 and 37 of the IR, a region encompassing three consecutive major and minor grooves. Methylated bases at the very end of the transposon (positions 1-9) and in the flanking DNA did not inhibit transposase binding. Thus, although transposase seems to be in intimate contact throughout the IR of gamma delta and 17 bp of flanking DNA, specific base pair recognition needed for binding appears to be determined by the inner three-quarters of the IR."
https://openalex.org/W1546806104,"The copper centers of nitrous oxide reductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain P2 were studied by x-ray and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The enzyme is dimeric and contains four Cu atoms and about seven cysteine residues/subunit of Mr = 73,000. The extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EX-AFS) spectrum was analyzed for enzyme as isolated (oxidized or slightly reduced), enzyme exposed briefly to air, reduced enzyme, and enzyme at pH 7 after having been activated by standing at pH 10. The average Cu ligand environment in the first shell was best modeled for all forms of the enzyme by a combination of N/O and S atoms at a total coordination number between 3 and 4 and bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.03 A for Cu-N/O and 2.20-2.25 A for Cu-S. The data could be fit without using Cu-Cu interactions. Overall the results are similar to those reported for the enzyme for Pseudomonas stutzeri (Scott, R. A., Zumft, W.G., Coyle, C.L., and Dooley, D.M. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 4082-4086). The first derivative EPR spectra of the Cu(II) centers at 15 and 45 K were qualitatively similar among enzyme as isolated and enzyme exposed to N2O or air. These three nominally oxidized samples showed an axial signal with g perpendicular = 2.03 and g parallel = 2.15-2.16. Hyperfine structure was observed in both the g parallel and g perpendicular regions with splittings of 43 and 25 gauss, respectively. These hyperfine components are attributed to exchange coupled Cu(I)-Cu(II) S = 1/2 (half-met) centers. In the enzyme as isolated and after exposure to N2O, about 3/4 of the Cu was EPR silent, whereas after exposure to air the signal integrated to about half the Cu concentration. The EPR spectrum of enzyme activated at pH 10 but frozen at pH 7 was a composite of spectra from activated and inactive species. The activated species presented a complex set of narrow hyperfine components which may arise from contributions from more than one species of half-met center."
https://openalex.org/W1592346112,"Amiloride analogs with hydrophobic substitutions on the 5-amino nitrogen atom are relatively high affinity inhibitors of the plasma membrane Na(+)-H+ exchanger. We demonstrated that a high affinity-binding site for [3H]5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl)amiloride ([3H]MIA) (Kd = 6.3 nM, Bmax = 1.2 pmol/mg of protein) is present in microvillus membrane vesicles but not in basolateral membrane vesicles isolated from rabbit renal cortex, in accord with the known membrane localization of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger in this tissue. The rank order potency for inhibition of microvillus membrane [3H]MIA binding by amiloride analogs was: MIA (I50 approximately 10 nM) greater than amiloride (I50 approximately 200 nM) greater than benzamil (I50 approximately 1200 nM). This correlated with a qualitatively similar rank order potency for inhibition of Na(+)-H+ exchange: MIA (I50 approximately 4 microM) greater than amiloride (I50 approximately 15 microM) greater than benzamil (I50 approximately 100 microM), but did not correlate with the rank order potency for inhibition of the organic cation-H+ exchanger in microvillus membrane vesicles: MIA approximately benzamil (I50 approximately 0.5 microM) greater than amiloride (I50 approximately 10 microM). However, tetraphenylammonium, an inhibitor of organic cation-H+ exchange, inhibited the rate of [3H]MIA binding without an effect on equilibrium [3H]MIA binding; the dissociation of bound [3H]MIA was inhibited by preloading the membrane vesicles with tetraphenylammonium. These findings indicated that high affinity [3H]MIA binding to renal microvillus membrane vesicles takes place at an internal site to which access is rate-limited by the tetraphenylammonium-sensitive organic cation transporter. Equilibrium [3H]MIA binding was inhibited by H+ but was unaffected by concentrations of Na+ or Li+ that saturate the external transport site of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger. Binding of MIA to its high affinity binding site had no effect on the rate of Na(+)-H+ exchange. This study suggests that the renal Na(+)-H+ exchanger has a high affinity internal binding site for amiloride analogs that is distinct from the external amiloride inhibitory site."
https://openalex.org/W1494647211,"Benzodiazepine discontinuation can lead to a behavioral syndrome in animals and humans. In a mouse model, this syndrome is associated with benzodiazepine receptor up-regulation. The protein-modifying reagent, N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ), has been used to irreversibly inactivate a number of neurotransmitter receptors including benzodiazepine receptors, and thus allows estimation of receptor recovery in vivo. To assess benzodiazepine receptor recovery after benzodiazepine discontinuation, we treated mice with lorazepam (LRZ), 2 mg·kg–1·day–1 for 1 wk. After 24 h, EEDQ (12.5 mg/kg) was administered, and benzodiazepine binding in the cortex and cerebellum was determined after 4–144 h. EEDQ treatment decreased receptor density in the cortex in both LRZ- and vehicle-treated groups by approximately 50%, with no change in apparent affinity as previously reported. Binding in both groups returned to control values after 96 h. Kinetic analysis indicated a more rapid increase in binding in LRZ-compared with vehicle-treated animals, with t1/2 for LRZ 19.1 h, and for vehicle, 30.8 h (P < 0.05). Receptor density was decreased in the cerebellum after EEDQ by approximately 40% in both treatment groups, with no change in apparent affinity. Receptor density returned to control values at 96 h, with no difference in kinetics in LRZ- compared with vehicle-treated mice. The decrease in receptor t1/2 associated with lorazepam discontinuation is consistent with the observed increase in benzodiazepine receptors in this setting.—Miller, L.

In unimmunized mice, transfected cells remained intact for 7 days or longer, and the site of injection showed only slight lymphocyte infiltration. In contrast, in immunized mice, transfected cells elicited massive lymphocyte infiltration and were mostly destroyed by day 4. Analysis of infiltrating cells revealed that they were mainly Thy1+ and CD8+ lymphocytes along with small numbers of CD5+, CD4+, and B lymphocytes. These studies show that transfected murine cells expressing gD can be used to study the in vivo immune response to single viral proteins and they argue that the immune response contributes to the pathogenesis of HSV infection."
