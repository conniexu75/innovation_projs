https://openalex.org/W2262414037,"To characterize somatic alterations in colorectal carcinoma, we conducted a genome-scale analysis of 276 samples, analysing exome sequence, DNA copy number, promoter methylation and messenger RNA and microRNA expression. A subset of these samples (97) underwent low-depth-of-coverage whole-genome sequencing. In total, 16% of colorectal carcinomas were found to be hypermutated: three-quarters of these had the expected high microsatellite instability, usually with hypermethylation and MLH1 silencing, and one-quarter had somatic mismatch-repair gene and polymerase ε (POLE) mutations. Excluding the hypermutated cancers, colon and rectum cancers were found to have considerably similar patterns of genomic alteration. Twenty-four genes were significantly mutated, and in addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations in ARID1A, SOX9 and FAM123B. Recurrent copy-number alterations include potentially drug-targetable amplifications of ERBB2 and newly discovered amplification of IGF2. Recurrent chromosomal translocations include the fusion of NAV2 and WNT pathway member TCF7L1. Integrative analyses suggest new markers for aggressive colorectal carcinoma and an important role for MYC-directed transcriptional activation and repression."

To comprehensively understand the diversity and ecology of this huge kingdom, DNA barcoding targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal repeat has been regarded as a prerequisite procedure. By extensively surveying ITS sequences in public databases, we designed new ITS primers with improved coverage across diverse taxonomic groups of fungi compared to existing primers. An in silico analysis based on public sequence databases indicated that the newly designed primers matched 99% of ascomycete and basidiomycete ITS taxa (species, subspecies or varieties), causing little taxonomic bias toward either fungal group. Two of the newly designed primers could inhibit the amplification of plant sequences and would enable the selective investigation of fungal communities in mycorrhizal associations, soil, and other types of environmental samples. Optimal PCR conditions for the primers were explored in an in vitro investigation. The new primers developed in this study will provide a basis for ecological studies on the diversity and community structures of fungi in the era of massive DNA sequencing."

https://openalex.org/W2032640887,"Epigenetic information is frequently erased near the start of each new generation. In some cases, however, epigenetic information can be transmitted from parent to progeny (multigenerational epigenetic inheritance). A particularly notable example of this type of epigenetic inheritance is double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans. This RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) can be inherited for more than five generations. To understand this process, here we conduct a genetic screen for nematodes defective in transmitting RNAi silencing signals to future generations. This screen identified the heritable RNAi defective 1 (hrde-1) gene. hrde-1 encodes an Argonaute protein that associates with small interfering RNAs in the germ cells of progeny of animals exposed to double-stranded RNA. In the nuclei of these germ cells, HRDE-1 engages the nuclear RNAi defective pathway to direct the trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys 9 (H3K9me3) at RNAi-targeted genomic loci and promote RNAi inheritance. Under normal growth conditions, HRDE-1 associates with endogenously expressed short interfering RNAs, which direct nuclear gene silencing in germ cells. In hrde-1- or nuclear RNAi-deficient animals, germline silencing is lost over generational time. Concurrently, these animals exhibit steadily worsening defects in gamete formation and function that ultimately lead to sterility. These results establish that the Argonaute protein HRDE-1 directs gene-silencing events in germ-cell nuclei that drive multigenerational RNAi inheritance and promote immortality of the germ-cell lineage. We propose that C. elegans use the RNAi inheritance machinery to transmit epigenetic information, accrued by past generations, into future generations to regulate important biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2085540051,"Combining analysis of host proteome and transcriptome perturbations induced by tumour virus proteins with ongoing genome-wide studies of cancer facilitates the prioritization of cancer genes. This systematic search for host targets of tumour viruses, using proteome and transcriptome analyses of viral proteins from mammalian DNA viruses with transforming or tumorigenic properties, provides an extensive catalogue of changes in genetic and protein expression that can be screened against genome-wide studies of cancer. The study focuses on human papillomavirus, Epstein–Barr virus, adenovirus and polyomavirus. The resulting list of transforming viral protein targets identifies causal genes within both somatic and Mendelian cancer-associated loci. Genotypic differences greatly influence susceptibility and resistance to disease. Understanding genotype–phenotype relationships requires that phenotypes be viewed as manifestations of network properties, rather than simply as the result of individual genomic variations1. Genome sequencing efforts have identified numerous germline mutations, and large numbers of somatic genomic alterations, associated with a predisposition to cancer2. However, it remains difficult to distinguish background, or ‘passenger’, cancer mutations from causal, or ‘driver’, mutations in these data sets. Human viruses intrinsically depend on their host cell during the course of infection and can elicit pathological phenotypes similar to those arising from mutations3. Here we test the hypothesis that genomic variations and tumour viruses may cause cancer through related mechanisms, by systematically examining host interactome and transcriptome network perturbations caused by DNA tumour virus proteins. The resulting integrated viral perturbation data reflects rewiring of the host cell networks, and highlights pathways, such as Notch signalling and apoptosis, that go awry in cancer. We show that systematic analyses of host targets of viral proteins can identify cancer genes with a success rate on a par with their identification through functional genomics and large-scale cataloguing of tumour mutations. Together, these complementary approaches increase the specificity of cancer gene identification. Combining systems-level studies of pathogen-encoded gene products with genomic approaches will facilitate the prioritization of cancer-causing driver genes to advance the understanding of the genetic basis of human cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2012441269,"Viruses must enter host cells to replicate, assemble and propagate. Because of the restricted size of their genomes, viruses have had to evolve efficient ways of exploiting host cell processes to promote their own life cycles and also to escape host immune defence mechanisms. Many viral open reading frames (viORFs) with immune-modulating functions essential for productive viral growth have been identified across a range of viral classes. However, there has been no comprehensive study to identify the host factors with which these viORFs interact for a global perspective of viral perturbation strategies. Here we show that different viral perturbation patterns of the host molecular defence network can be deduced from a mass-spectrometry-based host-factor survey in a defined human cellular system by using 70 innate immune-modulating viORFs from 30 viral species. The 579 host proteins targeted by the viORFs mapped to an unexpectedly large number of signalling pathways and cellular processes, suggesting yet unknown mechanisms of antiviral immunity. We further experimentally verified the targets heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, the WNK (with-no-lysine) kinase family and USP19 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 19) as vulnerable nodes in the host cellular defence system. Evaluation of the impact of viral immune modulators on the host molecular network revealed perturbation strategies used by individual viruses and by viral classes. Our data are also valuable for the design of broad and specific antiviral therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1987893946,"APJ is shown to be a bifunctional receptor for both mechanical stretch and the endogenous peptide apelin, a finding that is important for the development of APJ agonists to treat heart failure. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been widely implicated in the control of cardiac function. Here, a GPCR known as APJ is shown to be a bifunctional receptor involved in the conversion from increased contractility of the heart to cardiac failure. In response to its ligand apelin, which is known to be cardioprotective, APJ mediates adaptive remodelling. Conversely, stretch-dependent apelin-independent APJ activation accounts for pathological remodelling. These findings are important for the development of APJ agonists as treatments for heart failure. Cardiac hypertrophy is initiated as an adaptive response to sustained overload but progresses pathologically as heart failure ensues1. Here we report that genetic loss of APJ, a G-protein-coupled receptor, confers resistance to chronic pressure overload by markedly reducing myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure. In contrast, mice lacking apelin (the endogenous APJ ligand) remain sensitive, suggesting an apelin-independent function of APJ. Freshly isolated APJ-null cardiomyocytes exhibit an attenuated response to stretch, indicating that APJ is a mechanosensor. Activation of APJ by stretch increases cardiomyocyte cell size and induces molecular markers of hypertrophy. Whereas apelin stimulates APJ to activate Gαi and elicits a protective response, stretch signals in an APJ-dependent, G-protein-independent fashion to induce hypertrophy. Stretch-mediated hypertrophy is prevented by knockdown of β-arrestins or by pharmacological doses of apelin acting through Gαi. Taken together, our data indicate that APJ is a bifunctional receptor for both mechanical stretch and the endogenous peptide apelin. By sensing the balance between these stimuli, APJ occupies a pivotal point linking sustained overload to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy."

https://openalex.org/W2155013220,"The Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of anaerobic CO2 fixation with hydrogen as reductant is considered a candidate for the first life-sustaining pathway on earth because it combines carbon dioxide fixation with the synthesis of ATP via a chemiosmotic mechanism. The acetogenic bacterium Acetobacterium woodii uses an ancient version of the pathway that has only one site to generate the electrochemical ion potential used to drive ATP synthesis, the ferredoxin-fueled, sodium-motive Rnf complex. However, hydrogen-based ferredoxin reduction is endergonic, and how the steep energy barrier is overcome has been an enigma for a long time. We have purified a multimeric [FeFe]-hydrogenase from A. woodii containing four subunits (HydABCD) which is predicted to have one [H]-cluster, three [2Fe2S]-, and six [4Fe4S]-clusters consistent with the experimental determination of 32 mol of Fe and 30 mol of acid-labile sulfur. The enzyme indeed catalyzed hydrogen-based ferredoxin reduction, but required NAD+ for this reaction. NAD+ was also reduced but only in the presence of ferredoxin. NAD+ and ferredoxin reduction both required flavin. Spectroscopic analyses revealed that NAD+ and ferredoxin reduction are strictly coupled and that they are reduced in a 1:1 stoichiometry. Apparently, the multimeric hydrogenase of A. woodii is a soluble energy-converting hydrogenase that uses electron bifurcation to drive the endergonic ferredoxin reduction by coupling it to the exergonic NAD+ reduction.

Carbon dioxide fixation is the essential feature for lithoautotrophic growth and is a prerequisite for microbes to inhabit the early earth. Carbon dioxide fixation requires reducing equivalents that may have come from oxidation of gases such as hydrogen or carbon monoxide. In addition, energy has to be conserved during the process to provide the power for the synthesis of macromolecules. A pathway known to meet both needs is the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway which is considered to have evolved on earth very early. It provides two essential features for a life-sustaining process from the most basic chemical building blocks: carbon dioxide fixation that provides cells with a precursor, acetyl-CoA, for biomass production and conservation of energy in the form of ATP (1Fuchs G.

A deeply branching thermophilic bacterium with an ancient acetyl-CoA pathway dominates a subsurface ecosystem.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e30559Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The pathway involves the reduction of carbon dioxide to formate, binding of formate to the cofactor tetrahydrofolate and its subsequent reduction to methyl-tetrahydrofolate (Fig. 1). An additional mol of carbon dioxide is reduced to form enzyme-trapped carbon monoxide that is then condensed with a methyl group and coenzyme A to yield acetyl-CoA. In the anabolic route, acetyl-CoA is the precursor molecule for biosynthetic reactions (5Ragsdale S.W. Enzymology of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of acetogenesis.Ann. N.Y. Acad.

The anaerobic acetogenic bacterium Acetobacterium woodii uses a simple, ancient version of this pathway that combines carbon dioxide fixation with the generation and utilization of a sodium ion gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane for ATP synthesis (4Takami H. Noguchi H. Takaki Y. Uchiyama I. Toyoda A. Nishi S. Chee G.J. Arai W. Nunoura T. Itoh T. Hattori M. Takai K.

That pathway does not involve cytochromes or quinones. Instead, A. woodii employs a sodium-motive ferredoxin:NAD+-oxidoreductase (Rnf complex) that couples the exergonic electron flow from reduced ferredoxin to NAD+ to establish a transmembrane electrochemical Na+ gradient that then drives the synthesis of ATP via a well characterized Na+ F1F0-ATP synthase (9Imkamp F.

The genome sequence showed that the Rnf complex is apparently the only ion (Na+) motive enzyme coupled with the process of acetogenesis, which underlines the importance of reduced ferredoxin for the energy metabolism of A. woodii (8Poehlein A.

Reduced ferredoxin not only fuels the Rnf complex but is also the electron donor for the reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide (Eo′ CO2/CO = −520 mV (16Dangel W. Schulz H. Diekert G. König H. Fuchs G. Occurrence of corrinoid-containing membrane proteins in anaerobic bacteria.Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 148: 52-56Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar)), a key reaction in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. However, reduction of ferredoxin with hydrogen as reductant is an endergonic process (Eo′ H2/2H+ = −414 mV; the exact redox potential of A. woodii ferredoxin is not known, but because the essential ferredoxin-dependent reduction step from CO2 to CO has a redox potential of −520 mV (16Dangel W. Schulz H. Diekert G. König H. Fuchs G. Occurrence of corrinoid-containing membrane proteins in anaerobic bacteria.Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 148: 52-56Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) we can assume a redox potential of at least one ferredoxin in the same order of magnitude). Thus, the question is how this steep energetic barrier for electron flow from hydrogen to ferredoxin is overcome. In methanogenic archaea a reverse electron flow driven by the transmembrane ion potential and catalyzed by the Ech hydrogenase is the driving force for this endergonic reaction (17Hedderich R.

Deppenmeier U. Involvement of Ech hydrogenase in energy conservation of Methanosarcina mazei.FEBS J. 2010; 277: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Such an enzyme is not encoded in the genome of A. woodii. One candidate is a ferredoxin-reducing hydrogenase. A protein fraction enriched from the cytoplasm of A. woodii was indeed shown to catalyze hydrogen-dependent reduction of ferredoxin or flavodoxin, pyridine nucleotides were not tested (19Ragsdale S.W. Ljungdahl L.G. Hydrogenase from Acetobacterium woodii.Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 139: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the enzyme(s) involved in the reaction was (were) not identified or further characterized. The genome of A. woodii encodes one monomeric [FeFe]-hydrogenase that is genetically organized in the context of the formate dehydrogenase, indicating a role in formate oxidation (8Poehlein A.

Methylviologen reduction was monitored at 604 nm (ϵ = 13.9 mm−1 cm−1). Physiological hydrogenase activity with NAD+ and ferredoxin was measured in buffer 1 at 340 nm and 430 nm, respectively (ϵNADH = 6.2 mm−1 cm−1, ϵFd = 13.1 mm−1 cm−1).

To purify the hydrogenase, we used fructose-grown cells because lithoautotrophic growth leads to insufficient cell growth and inefficient protein levels and because it was known from the proteomics data that the multimeric hydrogenase is also produced during heterotrophic growth (8Poehlein A.

Cells were grown to the late exponential growth phase, harvested, and disrupted with a French pressure cell. Membranes were removed by ultracentrifugation, and the hydrogenase was purified from the cytoplasm by ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose followed by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. This procedure yielded an apparently homogeneous preparation. The enzyme was purified 6-fold to apparent homogeneity with an average specific activity of 760 units/mg (Table 1).TABLE 1Purification of the hydrogenasePurification stepProteinHydrogenase activityYieldPurificationmgμmol H2/min per mg%-foldCytoplasm1,3621131001Q-Sepharose86.829216.52.6Phenyl-Sepharose22.64286.23.8Sephacryl S-3009.17114.26.3 Open table in a new tab When the purified enzyme was analyzed on a nondenaturing gel, one protein of apparent mass of 300 kDa was visible. This protein had hydrogenase activity as apparent from an “in gel” activity assay (Fig. 2, B and C). When the protein was separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, two bands were visible after staining with Coomassie, but mass spectrometric analyses of the proteins revealed that each band contains two distinct proteins (Fig. 2A). The band with the apparent molecular mass of 68 kDa harbors HydA (63.6 kDa) and HydB (64.5 kDa), and the band with a mass of 13 kDa contained HydC (14.1 kDa) and HydD (14.3 kDa). Estimating the molecular mass via analytical gel filtration gave a value of 260 kDa. Taken together, these data are consistent with a homodimer of a HydABCD tetramer. With the amino acid sequence data obtained by peptide mass fingerprinting the encoding genes could be identified in the genome of A. woodii (8Poehlein A. Schmidt S. Kaster A.K. Goenrich M. Vollmers J. Thürmer A. Bertsch J. Schuchmann K. Voigt B. Hecker M. Daniel R. Thauer R.K. Gottschalk G. Müller V.

They are present in a gene cluster that contains an additional gene, hydE, whose product was not detected in the purified complex. HydE has a putative histidine kinase domain and may be involved in biogenesis of the complex or gene regulation. Based on sequence analysis HydA is predicted as the catalytic subunit for hydrogen oxidation containing the H-cluster of a [FeFe]-hydrogenase, one [2Fe2S], and three [4Fe4S] clusters. HydB has a predicted flavin binding site, one [2Fe2S], and three [4Fe4S] clusters. Based on sequence similarity to the 51-kDa subunit of complex I of bacterial electron transport chains we propose that this subunit is the site of NAD+ reduction. HydB has a C-terminal stretch with 41% similarity to ferredoxin of Clostridium acidiurici. A. woodii HydB contains 10 positively charged residues in this 58-residue segment, whereas C. acidiurici ferredoxin has only one positively charged amino acid. It is possible that this site serves as binding site for the negatively charged ferredoxin. HydC is predicted to contain one [2Fe2S]-cluster, and HydD has no predicted cofactors. The enzyme contained 32 ± 1.6 mol of iron/mol of protein and 30 ± 1.9 mol of acid-labile sulfide/mol of protein, which was determined colorimetrically. These data agree with the predicted three [2Fe2S], six [4Fe4S], and one H-cluster. Flavins were not detected in the purified protein. The enzyme reduced methylviologen with hydrogen as reductant with a rate of ∼760 units/mg. This assay was used routinely to determine the basic biochemical properties of the enzyme. At the optimal growth temperature (30 °C), hydrogenase activity was only 25% of the maximal activity observed at 45 °C; above this temperature, the activity declined sharply. The enzyme was inhibited by CO with 50% inhibition at ∼ 0.1 nm CO in the aqueous phase, which corresponds to ∼0.01% CO in the gas phase. We first determined whether the enzyme can catalyze the energetic “downhill” transport of electrons from molecular hydrogen (Eo′ H2/2H+ = −414 mV) to NAD+ (Eo′ NADH + H+/NAD = −320 mV). In the absence of other electron carriers, NAD+ was not reduced. Addition of ferredoxin or FMN to the assay yielded only a little NAD+-reducing activity, but addition of both ferredoxin and FMN established higher NAD+ reduction activity (Fig. 3), indicating that both ferredoxin and flavin are required for electron transfer from molecular hydrogen to NAD+. Enzyme kinetics were measured to determine a quantitative relationship between ferredoxin and FMN concentrations and the NAD+ reduction activity. The dependence of the reaction on ferredoxin was hyperbolic with saturation at 40 μm ferredoxin, the Km was 12 ± 3 μm (Fig. 4A). The dependence of the reaction on FMN was hyperbolic as well, saturation was at ∼50 mm, and the Km was 6.3 ± 1.4 μm (Fig. 4B). The experiments described above clearly demonstrated NAD+ reduction that was dependent on the presence of both ferredoxin and FMN. Next, we asked whether the enzyme could also reduce ferredoxin. When incubated in the absence of other electron carriers, ferredoxin was not reduced. However, upon addition of both FMN and NAD+, ferredoxin was reduced. The dependence of the reaction on NAD+ was hyperbolic with saturation at 0.5 mm NAD+; the Km was 49 ± 18 μm (Fig. 5). The dependence of the reaction on the hydrogen concentration was also hyperbolic, the Km was 6.3 ± 1.9% H2 in the gas phase. The data demonstrate that ferredoxin and NAD+ were reduced by the [FeFe]-hydrogenase of A. woodii, and reduction of one was strictly dependent on the presence of the other electron acceptor. To address whether ferredoxin and NAD+ were reduced at the same time, the isolated enzyme was incubated with NAD+ and ferredoxin, and the reduction of both (with hydrogen as reductant) was monitored photometrically by measuring the absorption at 340 nm (NADH + H+) and 430 nm (Fd2−). Ferredoxin was indeed reduced alongside NAD+ (Fig. 6). The activity was also dependent on the presence of FMN in the reaction mixture. To verify that ferredoxin was indeed reduced alongside NAD+, the absorption spectrum of ferredoxin was assayed under different conditions. When ferredoxin was incubated under an atmosphere of hydrogen in the presence of the purified hydrogenase, a typical absorption spectrum for oxidized ferredoxin was observed (Fig. 7). Addition of FMN did not change the ferredoxin spectrum, but additional NAD+ led to an absorption spectrum similar to sodium dithionite-reduced ferredoxin. This experiment clearly shows reduction of ferredoxin by the multimeric hydrogenase of A. woodii and confirms the strict coupling of NAD+ and ferredoxin reduction.FIGURE 7Spectral analyses of NAD+-dependent ferredoxin reduction. The assay mixture contained under an atmosphere of 100% hydrogen at 1.1 bar 50 mm EPPS, 2 mm dithioerythritol, pH 8.0, and 50 μm ferredoxin, 50 μm FMN, 2 mm NAD+, and 15 μg/ml hydrogenase.

From these data the amount of mol NAD+ reduced per mol of ferredoxin was calculated. From a number of experiments a stoichiometry of NAD+:ferredoxin of 1:1 was obtained (Fig. 8). Electron bifurcation was first demonstrated for the Etf/butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase complex of Clostridium kluyveri (20Li F. Hinderberger J. Seedorf H. Zhang J. Buckel W. Thauer R.K. Coupled ferredoxin and crotonyl coenzyme A (CoA) reduction with NADH catalyzed by the butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase/Etf complex from Clostridium kluyveri.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) in which the energetic downhill flux two-times one electron from NADH + H+ to crotonyl-CoA drives the endergonic uphill transport of two-times one electron from NADH + H+ to ferredoxin. The reduced ferredoxin is then used to produce hydrogen with a ferredoxin-dependent hydrogenase or to fuel the Rnf complex (21Herrmann G. Jayamani E. Mai G. Buckel W. Energy conservation via electron-transferring flavoprotein in anaerobic bacteria.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Electron bifurcation in strictly anaerobic bacteria and archaea, as it is understood today, requires flavins. The biochemistry of the reaction is still in its infancy, and two mechanisms are discussed. One is based on the assumption that flavoproteins can exhibit three different redox potentials for the FP/FPH2, FP/FPH, and FPH/FPH2 with a stable semiquinone state (20Li F. Hinderberger J. Seedorf H. Zhang J. Buckel W. Thauer R.K. Coupled ferredoxin and crotonyl coenzyme A (CoA) reduction with NADH catalyzed by the butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase/Etf complex from Clostridium kluyveri.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). A different mechanism was proposed by Nitschke and Russel (32Nitschke W. Russell M.J. Redox bifurcations. Mechanisms and importance to life now, and at its origin: a widespread means of energy conversion in biology unfolds.Bioessays. 2012; 34: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this case the flavin does not exhibit a stable semiquinone state but, instead, while in its redox-crossed-over regime the fully reduced flavin delivers its first electron in an exergonic reaction to the “low potential electron” acceptor, leaving behind a highly reactive low potential flavin that will subsequently reduce the ferredoxin in close proximity. The low potential electron acceptor thus is needed to “activate” the flavin to a high potential redox state to enable electron transfer to ferredoxin. In this reaction sequence the nominal midpoint potential for the two-electron-reduction of the left behind fully oxidized flavin is between NADH/NAD+/(Eo′ = −320 mV) and Fd/Fd2− (Eo′ ∼ −500 mV) couple thus facilitating the reduction with hydrogen (Eo′ = −414 mV). The molecular basis for this reaction sequence has to await structural studies as much as the redox properties of the enzyme and the bound flavin need to be investigated to prove this model. In addition to the Etf/butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase complex flavin-dependent electron bifurcation was also found for the heterodisulfide reductase in noncytochrome-containing methanogens that couple exergonic heterodisulfide reduction to the endergonic reduction of ferredoxin (22Kaster A.K. Moll J. Parey K. Thauer R.K. Coupling of ferredoxin and heterodisulfide reduction via electron bifurcation in hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 2981-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Moreover, an electron-bifurcating transhydrogenase was described in C. kluyveri (23Wang S. Huang H. Moll J. Thauer R.K. NADP+ reduction with reduced ferredoxin and NADP+ reduction with NADH are coupled via an electron bifurcating enzyme complex in Clostridium kluyveri.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 5115-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A hydrogen-evolving hydrogenase has been described in Thermotoga maritima that has three subunits with similarity to the subunits of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase of A. woodii (33Verhagen M.F. O'Rourke T. Adams M.W. The hyperthermophilic bacterium, Thermotoga maritima, contains an unusually complex iron-hydrogenase: amino acid sequence analyses versus biochemical characterization.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 212-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Schut G.J. Adams M.W. The iron-hydrogenase of Thermotoga maritima utilizes ferredoxin and NADH synergistically: a new perspective on anaerobic hydrogen production.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4451-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). That enzyme oxidizes NADH + H+ and produces H2, but there was twice as much H2 produced than NADH + H+ consumed. Because hydrogen production from NADH + H+ was dependent on ferredoxin, it was postulated that the “missing electrons” for hydrogen production derived from reduced ferredoxin, and a stoichiometry of Fd2− and NADH + H+ of 1:1 was proposed. It was suggested that the enzyme represents a new class of electron-bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenases in which the exergonic oxidation of ferredoxin (Eo′ = −453 mV) is used to drive the unfavorable oxidation of NADH to produce H2. Because the enzyme is a hydrogen-evolving hydrogenase that combines electrons derived from reduced ferredoxin and NADH + H+ to reduce protons to hydrogen gas, the term electron-confurcating hydrogenase was suggested for this hydrogen-evolving hydrogenase (35Huang H. Wang S. Moll J. Thauer R.K. Electron bifurcation involved in the energy metabolism of the acetogenic bacterium Moorella thermoacetica growing on glucose or H2 plus CO2.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 3689-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Here, we describe an electron-bifurcating hydrogenase that apparently couples the reverse reaction, exergonic downhill flux of two electrons to NAD+ that then drives the endergonic uphill transport of two electrons from hydrogen to ferredoxin. Two independent sets of experiments clearly show the reduction of ferredoxin and firmly establish a Fd2−:NADH + H+ stoichiometry of 1:1. The total amount of ferredoxin reduced is another argument in favor of a strict coupling. The monomeric iron-only hydrogenase of C. pasteurianum can also reduce ferredoxin, but only 55% of the ferredoxin was reduced under the same reaction conditions (22Kaster A.K. Moll J. Parey K. Thauer R.K. Coupling of ferredoxin and heterodisulfide reduction via electron bifurcation in hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 2981-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A further reduction was not possible because the thermodynamic equilibrium of ferredoxin reduction with hydrogen was reached. In contrast, the hydrogenase of A. woodii was able to reduce almost 100% of the ferredoxin. This is far above the thermodynamic equilibrium of the uncoupled reaction at the level of sodium dithionite-reduced ferredoxin (Eo′ = −660 mV (36Mayhew S.G. The redox potential of dithionite and SO2 from equilibrium reactions with flavodoxins, methylviologen, and hydrogen plus hydrogenase.Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar)). In contrast to the [FeFe]-hydrogenase from T. maritima the gene cluster of A. woodii has two additional genes hydD and hydE whose role is unknown. HydE is apparently not part of the purified enzyme. HydD is not predicted to have cofactors and, therefore, is unlikely involved in electron flow. HydD may have a role in assembly or stability of the complex. Based on the predicted cofactor content of the enzyme we propose that HydA is the entry point of electrons derived from molecular hydrogen. Electrons are then transferred to HydB which contains a flavin binding site and, thus, is the site of bifurcating electrons to ferredoxin and NAD+ (Fig. 9). A hydrogenase with genetic organization similar to that in A. woodii has been characterized in Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis. This multimeric hydrogenase was reported to be only NAD+-dependent, and dependence of ferredoxin or even electron bifurcation was not reported (37Soboh B. Linder D. Hedderich R. A multisubunit membrane-bound [NiFe]-hydrogenase and an NADH-dependent Fe-only hydrogenase in the fermenting bacterium Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis.Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2451-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Tetrameric (and trimeric) hydrogenases with the same or similar genetic organization as present in A. woodii are widespread in bacteria (34Schut G.J. Adams M.W. The iron-hydrogenase of Thermotoga maritima utilizes ferredoxin and NADH synergistically: a new perspective on anaerobic hydrogen production.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4451-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 38Calusinska M. Happe T. Joris B. Wilmotte A. The surprising diversity of clostridial hydrogenases: a comparative genomic perspective.Microbiology. 2010; 156: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), indicating that the electron-bifurcating hydrogenase of A. woodii is just the tip of an iceberg and that the same mechanism of hydrogen activation may apply to hydrogenases from many different species. The [FeFe]-hydrogenase of A. woodii fills an important gap in our understanding of the bioenergetics of acetogenesis. The hydrogenase not only produces NADH + H+, which is used as a reductant in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, but also reduced ferredoxin. The reduced ferredoxin then serves two functions: it is used as “fuel” for the Rnf complex and thus ATP synthesis via a sodium ion gradient and it is used as reductant for the CO2/CO couple. Thus, a soluble enzyme overcomes the energy barrier in the first step of the electron pathway as well as one step in the carbon pathway. Because the metabolism of A. woodii is near the thermodynamic equilibrium with only one coupling site for the generation of an chemiosmotic ion gradient it seems reasonable not to use this gradient to facilitate the first reaction of lithoautotrophic growth. Instead, electron bifurcation drives the endergonic reaction without the need to use the energetically valuable ion gradient. The bifurcating mechanism of the hydrogenase underlines the simplicity of the metabolism of A. woodii. Close to the thermodynamic equilibrium the metabolism enables carbon fixation while conserving energy without the use of cytochromes, quinones, and other membrane-soluble electron carriers. With the Rnf complex as sole membrane-bound ion pump this is the most simple way of chemiosmotic energy conservation in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway while taking advantage of bifurcation as a soluble alternative to energy coupling. The A. woodii version of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway gives an answer to the question how life on earth might have evolved. The electron-bifurcating hydrogenase solves a puzzling feature in our understanding of ancient carbon dioxide fixation with hydrogen as sole source of reducing power. Further studies need to be done to shed light on the underlying molecular mechanism of electron transfer in this kind of soluble energy-coupling redox enzymes.

Imprinted genes are essential mediators of growth and development and are characterized by differentially methylated regulatory regions (DMRs) that carry parental allele-specific methylation profiles. This theoretical 50% level of methylation provides a baseline from which endogenously- or exogenously-induced deviations in methylation can be detected. We quantified DNA methylation at imprinted gene DMRs in a large panel of human conceptal tissues, in matched buccal cell specimens collected at birth and at one year of age, and in the major cell fractions of umbilical cord blood to assess the stability of methylation at these regions. DNA methylation was measured using validated pyrosequencing assays at seven DMRs regulating the IGF2/H19, DLK1/MEG3, MEST, NNAT and SGCE/PEG10 imprinted domains. DMR methylation did not significantly differ for the H19, MEST and SGCE/PEG10 DMRs across all conceptal tissues analyzed (ANOVA p>0.10). Methylation differences at several DMRs were observed in tissues from brain (IGF2 and MEG3-IG DMRs), liver (IGF2 and MEG3 DMRs) and placenta (both DLK1/MEG3 DMRs and NNAT DMR). In most infants, methylation profiles in buccal cells at birth and at one year of age were comparable, as was methylation in the major cell fractions of umbilical cord blood. Several infants showed temporal deviations in methylation at multiple DMRs. Similarity of inter-individual and intra-individual methylation at some, but not all of the DMRs analyzed supports the possibility that methylation of these regions can serve as useful biosensors of exposure."

Nevertheless, in several non-neuronal cell types, long term rapamycin application led to mTORC2 inhibition (14Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sengupta S. Sheen J.H. Hsu P.P. Bagley A.F. Markhard A.L.

It has been also shown that in non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell lines rapamycin can induce activity of known mTORC2 targets like Akt via activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) pathway most likely due to inhibition of negative feedback loops (15Sun S.Y. Rosenberg L.M. Wang X. Zhou Z. Yue P. Fu H. Khuri F.R. Activation of Akt and eIF4E survival pathways by rapamycin-mediated mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7052-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). It should be also noted that rapamycin can have non-mTOR-related effects due to its binding to FKBP12 (16Fulceri R. Giunti R. Knudsen J. Leuzzi R. Kardon T. Benedetti A.

Malik A. Jaworski J. Role of mTOR in physiology and pathology of the nervous system.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 116-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The role of particular mTOR complexes has been studied less rigorously in neurons, mostly because of technical reasons. Most extant evidence regarding dendritic arborization has been obtained with the use of rapamycin or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of mTOR (4Chow D.K. Groszer M. Pribadi M. Machniki M.

Seeburg D.P. Hoogenraad C.C. Sheng M. Control of dendritic arborization by thephosphoinositide-3‘-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway.J.

In fact, both complexes control cellular processes that are known for their participation in dendritogenesis. For example, studies in yeast and mammalian non-neuronal cells strongly suggest the involvement of mTORC1 in the regulation of myriad cellular processes, including translation and microtubule dynamics. Indeed, proteins that control either the translation or interaction of microtubules with actin have been shown to contribute to mTOR-dependent dendritic growth (5Jaworski J. Spangler S. Seeburg D.P. Hoogenraad C.C. Sheng M. Control of dendritic arborization by thephosphoinositide-3‘-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway.J.

Indeed, RhoA, Rac1, and cdc42 are among the best-characterized regulators of dendritic growth (22Li Z. Van Aelst L. Cline H.T.

We previously showed that active Akt enhances dendritic arborization (5Jaworski J. Spangler S. Seeburg D.P. Hoogenraad C.C. Sheng M.

Using shRNA-driven knockdown of Raptor and Rictor, unique components of mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively, this study provided evidence that both mTOR complexes are crucial for the proper dendritic arbor morphology of hippocampal neurons. These two complexes are required for dendritic development both under basal conditions and upon the induction of mTOR-dependent dendritic growth. We also identified Akt as a downstream effector of mTORC2 needed for proper dendritic arbor morphology, the action of which required mTORC1 and S6K1 activity.

As a negative control in the RNA interference (RNAi) experiments, pSUPER plasmid that carried scrambled shRNA was used in addition to an empty plasmid. Scrambled shRNAs were designed based on the original siRNA sequences using the online GeneScript tool.

The animals used to obtain neurons for tissue cultures were sacrificed according to a protocol approved by the First Ethical Committee, Warsaw, Poland. Primary rat hippocampal and cortical cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 (E18) rat brains according to Banker and Goslin (31Banker G. Goslin K.

For insulin-induced growth, immediately after transfection, the cells were transferred to a regular culture medium that contained a reduced concentration of B27 (0.2% instead of 2%; Invitrogen). Insulin (400 nm) was added for the first time 4 h after transfection and then every 24 h until cell fixation. In the case of transfection with doxycycline-inducible shRNAs, 1 μg/ml doxycycline was added to the culture medium 24 h post-transfection. For biochemical studies that required the high efficiency transfection of neurons, cortical neurons were transfected on DIV0 using an Amaxa Nucleofector II Device and Amaxa Rat Neuron Nucleofector kit (Lonza, Koln, Germany) according to the adjusted manufacturer's protocol (32Swiech L. Urbanska M. Macias M. Skalecka A. Jaworski J. Mukai H. Protein Kinase Technologies, Neuromethods. Vol. 68. Springer Science+Business Media, New York2012: 291-318Google Scholar). For the immunofluorescent staining of P-S6 and P-Akt, the neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde that contained 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. Afterward, staining was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cell Signaling Technology). The same protocol was used for the detection of phospho-eIF4B. For the immunodetection of endogenous Raptor and Rictor proteins, the cells were fixed for 10 min with ice-cold 100% methanol and air dried. Staining was then performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunostaining of transfected proteins was performed as described previously (8Swiech L.

For the analysis of dendritic morphology, cell images were obtained with a Nikon fluorescence microscope, Zeiss LSM5 Exciter, or Zeiss LSM710 NLO with 20× objective. For fluorescence intensity analysis, confocal cell images were obtained with 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution using a Zeiss LSM710 NLO microscope with 20× objective. Each image was a z-series of images, each averaged twice per line. The obtained stack was “flattened” into a single image using a maximum intensity projection. The confocal settings were kept the same for all scans when the fluorescence intensities of immunostaining in neuronal cell somas were compared. Morphometric analysis and quantification were performed as recently described (8Swiech L. Blazejczyk M. Urbanska M. Pietruszka P. Dortland B.R. Malik A.R. Wulf P.S. Hoogenraad C.C. Jaworski J.

For time-lapse imaging, neurons were imaged with an Olympus ScanR Station microscope with a 20× objective with 1000 × 1000 pixel resolution. Neurons were first imaged 24 h after transfection, and doxycycline was then added. Neurons were then imaged every 24 h for 3 consecutive days. For the analysis, we compared the number of newly added and retracted dendrites between two consecutive imaging sessions. For the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, DIV10 cortical neurons nucleofected at DIV0 were harvested in lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3% CHAPS, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors). The lysed cells were incubated on ice at 4 °C for 20 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove cellular debris. The proteins were then immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-mTOR conjugated to antibody Sepharose A (Amersham Biosciences). As a negative control, normal rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; Sigma) was used. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the resins were washed 4 times with wash buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 120 mm NaCl) and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting. The data were obtained from three independent batches of neurons. Exact numbers of cells and culture batches examined for dendritic arbor morphology and fluorescence intensity analyses are provided in the respective figure legends. The statistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) and the Mann-Whitney test. mTOR kinase has been shown to control dendritic arbor growth in neuronal cultures both in vitro and in vivo (4Chow D.K.

However, recent developments in the understanding of the molecular biology of distinct mTOR complexes show that previous studies, which mostly utilized chronic rapamycin treatment, could not distinguish which of the complexes is involved in the process of dendritic arbor shaping. Rapamycin was initially believed to be specific for mTORC1 but was later shown to also either block or induce mTORC2 if used chronically (14Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sengupta S. Sheen J.H. Hsu P.P.

Cell. 2006; 22: 159-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). What is more, the work done with use of non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell lines showed that chronic rapamycin treatment can induce phosphorylation of known mTORC2 targets (15Sun S.Y. Rosenberg L.M.

Activation of Akt and eIF4E survival pathways by rapamycin-mediated mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7052-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Because this issue has not been methodically addressed in neurons, we began our research by determining the effects of long term rapamycin application on the activity of both mTOR complexes (Fig. 1A). We treated hippocampal neurons cultured in vitro with 100 nm rapamycin for either 0.5 and 2 h or 24 and 72 h to achieve acute and chronic mTOR inhibition, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1A, rapamycin at all time points decreased the phosphorylation of rpS6 at Ser-235/236, reflecting decreased mTORC1 activity. Prolonged but not acute rapamycin treatment decreased the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473. Such inhibition is a hallmark of mTORC2 activity inhibition (20Sarbasso"
https://openalex.org/W2160099668,"The theoretical framework of energy-density functionals has been used to show that the depth of the confining nuclear potential has an important role in cluster formation, with a pronounced effect for relativistic functionals. Nucleonic matter — the protons and neutrons that comprise atomic nuclei — acts predominantly as a quantum liquid, but lighter nuclei behave more like molecules composed of clusters of protons and neutrons. Clustering is related to the overall nuclear interaction, but its detailed mechanism is not fully understood. These authors use theoretical modelling to calculate the conditions that cause clustering in neon-20, a small nucleus thought to favour clustering. They find that the depth of the confining nuclear potential plays an important part in cluster formation, with a particularly pronounced effect for relativistic functionals. More generally, clustering is considered as a transitional phenomenon between crystalline and quantum liquid phases. Nucleonic matter displays a quantum-liquid structure, but in some cases finite nuclei behave like molecules composed of clusters of protons and neutrons. Clustering is a recurrent feature in light nuclei, from beryllium to nickel1,2,3. Cluster structures are typically observed as excited states close to the corresponding decay threshold; the origin of this phenomenon lies in the effective nuclear interaction, but the detailed mechanism of clustering in nuclei has not yet been fully understood. Here we use the theoretical framework of energy-density functionals4,5, encompassing both cluster and quantum liquid-drop aspects of nuclei, to show that conditions for cluster formation can in part be traced back to the depth of the confining nuclear potential. For the illustrative example of neon-20, we show that the depth of the potential determines the energy spacings between single-nucleon orbitals in deformed nuclei, the localization of the corresponding wavefunctions and, therefore, the degree of nucleonic density clustering. Relativistic functionals, in particular, are characterized by deep single-nucleon potentials. When compared to non-relativistic functionals that yield similar ground-state properties (binding energy, deformation, radii), they predict the occurrence of much more pronounced cluster structures. More generally, clustering is considered as a transitional phenomenon between crystalline and quantum-liquid phases of fermionic systems."

https://openalex.org/W1977223232,"Background Microbial eukaryotes represent an important component of the human gut microbiome, with different beneficial or harmful roles; some species are commensal or mutualistic, whereas others are opportunistic or parasitic. The diversity of eukaryotes inhabiting humans remains relatively unexplored because of either the low abundance of these organisms in human gut or because they have received limited attention from a whole-community perspective. Methodology/Principal Finding In this study, a single fecal sample from a healthy African male was studied using both culture-dependent methods and extended molecular methods targeting the 18S rRNA and ITS sequences. Our results revealed that very few fungi, including Candida spp., Galactomyces spp., and Trichosporon asahii, could be isolated using culture-based methods. In contrast, a relatively a high number of eukaryotic species could be identified in this fecal sample when culture-independent methods based on various primer sets were used. A total of 27 species from one sample were found among the 977 analyzed clones. The clone libraries were dominated by fungi (716 clones/977, 73.3%), corresponding to 16 different species. In addition, 187 sequences out of 977 (19.2%) corresponded to 9 different species of plants; 59 sequences (6%) belonged to other micro-eukaryotes in the gut, including Entamoeba hartmanni and Blastocystis sp; and only 15 clones/977 (1.5%) were related to human 18S rRNA sequences. Conclusion Our results revealed a complex eukaryotic community in the volunteer’s gut, with fungi being the most abundant species in the stool sample. Larger investigations are needed to assess the generality of these results and to understand their roles in human health and disease."

https://openalex.org/W1966199715,"Exopolysaccharides are required for the development and integrity of biofilms produced by a wide variety of bacteria. In Escherichia coli, partial de-N-acetylation of the exopolysaccharide poly-β-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (PNAG) by the periplasmic protein PgaB is required for polysaccharide intercellular adhesin-dependent biofilm formation. To understand the molecular basis for PNAG de-N-acetylation, the structure of PgaB in complex with Ni(2+) and Fe(3+) have been determined to 1.9 and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively, and its activity on β-1,6-GlcNAc oligomers has been characterized. The structure of PgaB reveals two (β/α)(x) barrel domains: a metal-binding de-N-acetylase that is a member of the family 4 carbohydrate esterases (CE4s) and a domain structurally similar to glycoside hydrolases. PgaB displays de-N-acetylase activity on β-1,6-GlcNAc oligomers but not on the β-1,4-(GlcNAc)(4) oligomer chitotetraose and is the first CE4 member to exhibit this substrate specificity. De-N-acetylation occurs in a length-dependent manor, and specificity is observed for the position of de-N-acetylation. A key aspartic acid involved in de-N-acetylation, normally seen in other CE4s, is missing in PgaB, suggesting that the activity of PgaB is attenuated to maintain the low levels of de-N-acetylation of PNAG observed in vivo. The metal dependence of PgaB is different from most CE4s, because PgaB shows increased rates of de-N-acetylation with Co(2+) and Ni(2+) under aerobic conditions, and Co(2+), Ni(2+) and Fe(2+) under anaerobic conditions, but decreased activity with Zn(2+). The work presented herein will guide inhibitor design to combat biofilm formation by E. coli and potentially a wide range of medically relevant bacteria producing polysaccharide intercellular adhesin-dependent biofilms."

Energy metabolism fundamentally contributes to the beneficial effects of CR, but the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for this effect remain enigmatic. A multidisciplinary approach that involves quantitative proteomics, immunochemistry, metabolic quantification, and life span analysis was used to determine how CR, which occurs in the Caenorhabditis elegans eat-2 mutants, modifies energy metabolism of the worm, and whether the observed modifications contribute to the CR-mediated physiological responses. A switch to fatty acid metabolism as an energy source and an enhanced rate of energy metabolism by eat-2 mutant nematodes were detected. Life span analyses validated the important role of these previously unknown alterations of energy metabolism in the CR-mediated longevity of nematodes. As observed in mice, the overexpression of the gene for the nematode analog of the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase caused a marked extension of the life span in C. elegans, presumably by enhancing energy metabolism via an altered rate of cataplerosis of tricarboxylic acid cycle anions. We conclude that an increase, not a decrease in fuel consumption, via an accelerated oxidation of fuels in the TCA cycle is involved in life span regulation; this mechanism may be conserved across phylogeny.

In addition, CR delays the onset of various aging-related diseases, such as cancer and diabetes in both humans and animal models (9Weindruch R. Walford R.L.

Although the beneficial effects of CR are well established, its molecular and cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Recent studies suggest that CR initiates a regulatory process that monitors the function of proteins and senses changes in nutrients, to elicit appropriate physiological responses to these changes. In Caenorhabditis elegans, for example, genes encoding the energy sensor adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated kinase AAK-2 (11Apfeld J. O'Connor G. McDonagh T. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. The AMP-activated protein kinase AAK-2 links energy levels and insulin-like signals to life span in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), the nutrient sensor target of rapamycin kinase (12Jia K.

Oh S.W. Deplancke B. Luo J. Walhout A.J. Tissenbaum H.A. C. elegans 14-3-3 proteins regulate life span and interact with SIR-2.1 and DAF-16/FOXO.Mech. Ageing Dev. 2006; 127: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and transcription factors such as the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2/SKN-1) (14Bishop N.A. Guarente L. Two neurons mediate diet restriction-induced longevity in C. elegans.Nature. 2007; 447: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and the Foxa subfamily of forkhead box (FOXA/PHA-4) (15Panowski S.H.

PHA-4/Foxa mediates diet restriction-induced longevity of C. elegans.Nature. 2007; 447: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) have all been found to mediate the anti-aging effects of CR. At the cellular level, animals that are undergoing CR exhibit many changes that may contribute to the physiological benefits of this regime, such as reduced oxidative damage, suppressed protein synthesis, and a slowed, age-associated decline of DNA repair (7Masoro E.J. Overview of caloric restriction and ageing.Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 9Weindruch R. Walford R.L. The Retardation of Aging and Disease by Dietary Restriction. Charles C. Thomas Publishers, Springfield, IL1988Google Scholar, 10Masoro E.J. Subfield history. Caloric restriction, slowing aging, and extending life.Sci. Aging Knowledge Environ. 2003; 2003: RE2Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). CR also has been shown to alter the content of hormones and induce metabolic changes, including a decreased concentration of glucose, triglycerides, insulin, and growth factors in the blood (9Weindruch R. Walford R.L. The Retardation of Aging and Disease by Dietary Restriction. Charles C. Thomas Publishers, Springfield, IL1988Google Scholar, 10Masoro E.J. Subfield history. Caloric restriction, slowing aging, and extending life.Sci. Aging Knowledge Environ. 2003; 2003: RE2Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Several studies addressing the effect of CR on the metabolome and the transcriptome further suggest a connection between metabolism and the phenotypes of CR animals (17Wang Y. Lawler D. Larson B. Ramadan Z. Kochhar S. Holmes E. Nicholson J.K. Metabonomic investigations of aging and caloric restriction in a life-long dog study.J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18Kayo T. Allison D.B. Weindruch R. Prolla T.A.

Gene expression profile of aging and its retardation by caloric restriction.Science. 1999; 285: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). Despite these achievements, the influence of CR on metabolism at the organismal level and the consequent impact of this regulation on health and life span of animals are still poorly defined. For example, it has been hypothesized that CR slows the metabolism of animals, leading to a reduced production of reactive oxygen species that elicits an anti-aging effect (20Harman D. The biologic clock. The mitochondria?.J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1972; 20: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). However, CR nematodes demonstrate increased oxygen consumption (14Bishop N.A. Guarente L. Two neurons mediate diet restriction-induced longevity in C. elegans.Nature. 2007; 447: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 21Houthoofd K. Braeckman B.P. Lenaerts I. Brys K. De Vreese A. Van Eygen S. Vanfleteren J.R. No reduction of metabolic rate in food-restricted Caenorhabditis elegans.Exp. Gerontol. 2002; 37: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), arguing against this hypothesis. Therefore, it is critical to quantify the metabolism of living animals and examine the physiological outcome of this modification. The major questions arising from research involving a broad number of species is the mechanism of the effect of CR on energy metabolism as follows. 1) Is there a decreased energy expenditure to match the decreased food intake, and if so, which metabolic processes are altered to accommodate CR? 2) Is there a switch in the utilization of fuels caused by CR? 3) What regulates specific metabolic changes? A major limitation of research in this area has been the lack of a comprehensive assessment of the expression of specific proteins in response to CR and a correlation of these changes with the metabolic function of the organism. In this study, we report a more comprehensive approach using target proteomic analysis that is combined with metabolic flux measurements to answer some of the questions posed above. We first applied “stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture” (SILAC) to C. elegans. SILAC is a quantitative proteomic technique established in cell culture (22Ong S.E. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Kristensen D.B. Steen H. Pandey A. Mann M. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, SILAC, as a simple and accurate approach to expression proteomics.Mol. Cell.

Bailly A.P. Pourkarimi E. Hay R.T. Buchanan G. Coulthurst S. Xirodimas D.P. Gartner A. Lamond A.I. Stable-isotope labeling with amino acids in nematodes.Nat.

Quantitative proteomics by amino acid labeling in C. elegans.Nat.

Then our proteomic, bioinformatic, and immunoblotting studies suggested an energy source shift in metabolism from carbohydrates to fatty acids in eat-2 nematodes, a genetic model that manifests chronic CR. The eat-2 gene encodes an acetylcholine receptor subunit that is exclusively found in pharyngeal muscles and functions to regulate pharyngeal pumping (27Avery L. The genetics of feeding in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1993; 133: 897-917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The eat-2 mutant nematodes have a pharyngeal swallowing defect that compromises their food intake and thus serve as a genetic model of CR (28Lakowski B. Hekimi S. The genetics of caloric restriction in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13091-13096Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). We also determined the rate of TCA cycle flux by utilizing a number of specifically labeled substrates, and we related these values to various times in the life span of eat-2 and control nematodes to directly assess the alterations in energy metabolism that were induced by CR. Based on our findings, we propose that an accelerated rate of energy metabolism is a conserved process that is associated with longevity in nematodes. WT Bristol N2 strain nematodes were used in this study. The mutants eat-2 (ad465 and ad1116), enol-1 (ok2210), and pck-1 (ok2098) were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center. The eat-2 strain was out-crossed three times with N2 nematodes. Nematodes were maintained by standard methods that included culture on NGM plates (0.25% peptone, 51 mm NaCl, 25 mm K3PO4, 5 μg/ml cholesterol, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4) seeded with OP50 bacteria, cryostorage, and recovery from stocks. The composition of the media and solutions and the detailed protocols for their use were described previously (29Stiernagle T. Maintenance of C. elegans.WormBook. 2006; : 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). To synchronize their age, gravid nematodes were bleached according to a published protocol (29Stiernagle T. Maintenance of C. elegans.WormBook. 2006; : 1-11PubMed Google Scholar), and the surviving eggs were hatched as age-synchronized nematodes. In all experiments, the pre-fertile period of adulthood was identified as t = 0. For the generation of transgenic animals, a plasmid DNA mix was microinjected into the gonad of young adult hermaphrodite animals, using the standard method (30Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. Efficient gene transfer in C. elegans. Extrachromosomal maintenance and integration of transforming sequences.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). F1 progeny were selected on the basis of the roller phenotype. Individual F2 progenies were isolated to establish independent lines. For the generation of the EQ239 (pck-1 o.e.) strain, the plasmid DNA mix consisted of 5 ng/μl pAH103 (pck-1p::pck-1 genomic DNA) and 80 ng/μl pRF4 (rol-6). The pAH103 plasmid was constructed by cloning the entire 3.4-kb pck-1 gene and 2.7-kb upstream region from genomic DNA. Wild-type (N2) animals were microinjected to generate this strain. Microinjecting N2 animals with 80 ng/μl pRF4 (rol-6) alone did not affect the mean life span of N2 animals grown on OP50 (data not shown). Arginine and lysine auxotrophic Escherichia coli strain AT713 was obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center at Yale University. To label AT713 bacteria with heavy lysine, bacteria were first streaked on a lysogeny broth (LB) plate and cultured overnight at 37 °C. A single bacterial colony was then inoculated into 3 ml of LB and cultured overnight in an incubator shaker (I2500, New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NY) (set at 200 rpm) at 37 °C. Ten μl of bacterial culture was next inoculated into 5 ml of M9 basal medium (50 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm NH4Cl, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% glucose) supplemented with arginine (100 μg/ml), cysteine (100 μg/ml), and lysine (100 μg/ml, either regular or heavy lysine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA)) (M9 with amino acid supplementation) and continuously cultured in an incubator shaker (37 °C, 200 rpm) until the absorbance of the culture at 600 nm (A600) reached 1.0. A600 was measured with a Beckman Du® 640 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Two ml of the resulting labeled bacteria were next inoculated into 200 ml of M9 basal medium, with amino acid supplementation, and cultured in an incubator shaker (37 °C, 200 rpm) until A600 reached 1.5. Bacteria were next pelleted by a brief centrifugation (8,000 × g, 10 min, Beckman Avanti J-26 XP, Beckman Coulter) and resuspended in 10 ml of M9 basal medium. Bacteria then were spread onto a peptone-free NGM plate (500 μl for each 100-mm plate and 200 μl for each 60-mm plate) and exposed to 1000 mJ/cm2 of ultraviolet (UV) light (SpectroLinker XL-1500, Spectronics Corp.). Six animals from each strain were transferred onto a peptone-free NGM plate that had been seeded with heavy lysine-labeled or unlabeled AT713 bacteria, obtained by the methods described above. Gravid animals from the next generation of these nematodes were bleached to collect their live eggs, according to a protocol described previously (29Stiernagle T. Maintenance of C. elegans.WormBook. 2006; : 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). Eggs were transferred onto peptone-free NGM plates seeded with heavy lysine-labeled or unlabeled AT713 bacteria. Hatched, age-synchronized animals were next cultured to L4 (day 0) and then transferred to peptone-free NGM plates seeded with heavy lysine-labeled or unlabeled AT713 plates containing 25 mg/liter 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (Acros Organics). At day 3, nematodes were harvested using 2 ml of M9 basal medium and washed into 1.5-ml low retention tubes (Fisher). AT713 bacteria were then separated from nematodes with 6–8 washes with 1 ml of H2O, combined by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 1 min (accuSpin Mirco17, Fisher). Nematode pellets from the last centrifugation were defined as wet nematodes and subjected to proteomic sample preparation as described below. Equal weights (5.5 mg) of eat-2 (heavy lysine-labeled) and WT (unlabeled) worms were pooled in forward labeling proteomic experiments, whereas equal weights (7.7 mg) of WT (heavy lysine-labeled) and eat-2 (unlabeled) animals were pooled in reverse labeling experiments. The pooled worms were suspended in 100 μl of 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate, containing 2% perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (w/v), protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture 3 (Sigma), and proteins were then extracted by ultrasonication (4.5 kHz three times for 9 s with a 3-min pause on ice between the strokes) using a Virsonic 100 ultrasonic cell disrupter (SP Scientific). The resulting protein extract was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5417 C), and the supernatant was collected. Pellets were then resuspended in 100 μl of the same extraction buffer, sonicated, and centrifuged, and supernatants were saved as described above. The resulting supernatants from the two extractions were next combined, reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at 37 °C for 1 h, and then S-alkylated by 25 mm iodoacetamide at 25 °C for 1 h in the dark. Proteins were then precipitated by mixing with a 9-fold excess volume of ice-cold acetone and left for 2 h at −20 °C. The precipitated proteins were then centrifuged at 2,400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5417 C), and the pellet was washed twice with ice-cold acetone. Protein pellets were air-dried for 10 min and then redissolved in 50 μl of 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate, containing 2% PFOA (w/v) by sonication in a water bath for 10 min in a Bransonic Ultrasonic 2510R-MT (Danbury, CT). The resulting solution was diluted with 150 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate to reduce PFOA concentration to 0.5%, and the amount of dissolved protein was determined with a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). A total of 1.736 mg of protein in the forward labeling and 1.736 mg of protein in the reverse labeling experiments was digested by Lys-C (1:50 Lys-C to protein ratio w/w) at 37 °C for 18 h. The protein digests were dried in a speed-vac concentrator (Savant SC210A, Fisher) at 25 °C and then subjected to repeated reconstitution in 100 μl of ethanol/ethyl acetate/water/TFA (0.33:0.33:0.33:0.01, v/v) and evaporation to thoroughly remove PFOA as described previously (31Kadiyala C.S. Tomechko S.E. Miyagi M. Perfluorooctanoic acid for shotgun proteomics.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15332Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Lys-C digests were dissolved in 400 μl of 30 mm ammonium formate buffer at pH 10. Reverse phase chromatography was performed by using an XTerra MS C18 column (3.5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm, Waters) and a Thermo-Finnigan Surveyor MS pump Version 2.4 coupled to an Agilent 1100 series diode-array detector, Version 1.4. Peptides were next chromatographed using a linear gradient of 5–35% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% formic acid over 20 min at a 400 μl/min flow rate, followed by acetonitrile from 35 to 80% over 5 min. Eluents was directly introduced to the diode-array detector to monitor the peptide elution at 215 nm. Xcalibur software (Version 1.4 SR1, Thermo-Finnigan Inc.) was used for instrument control, data acquisition, and data processing. Column eluents were manually collected at 1-min intervals into 1.5-ml low retention tubes. Twenty peptide fractions were dried in a speed-vac concentrator. The residual salts were removed by reconstitution of each fraction in 100 μl of water, followed by drying in a speed-vac concentrator. Each peptide fraction was dissolved in 12 μl of 0.1% formic acid and subjected to LC-MS/MS. LC-MS/MS analyses used an UltiMate 3000 LC systems (Dionex Inc.) interfaced to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo-Finnigan, Bremen, Germany). The platform was operated in the nano-LC mode, using the standard nano-ESI API source fitted with a PicoTip emitter that had an uncoated fitting and 10-μm spray orifice (New Objective, Inc.). The solvent flow rate through the column was maintained at 300 nl/min. The protein digests (typically 5 μl) were injected into a reversed-phase 0.3 × 5 mm C18 PepMap trapping column with a 5-μm particle size (Dionex Inc.) that was equilibrated with 0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile (v/v). The column was washed for 5 min with the equilibration solution at a flow rate of 25 μl/min using an isocratic loading pump operated through an auto sampler. Next, the trapping column was switched in-line with a reversed-phase 0.075 × 150-mm C18 Acclaim PepMap 100 column (Dionex Inc.), and the peptides were chromatographed by using a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 6 to 60% in aqueous 0.1% formic acid over 100 min at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The eluent was directly introduced to the mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent MS to MS/MS switching mode, with five most intense ions in each MS scan subjected to MS/MS analysis. The full MS scan was performed at a resolution of 60,000 in the Orbitrap detector, and the MS/MS scans were performed in the ion trap detector in collision-induced dissociation mode. The threshold intensity for the MS/MS trigger was always set at 1000. The fragmentation was carried out using the collision-induced dissociation mode with normalized collision energy of 35. The data were entirely collected in the profile mode for the full MS scan and the centroid mode for the MS/MS scans. The dynamic exclusion function for previously selected precursor ions applied the following parameters: repeat count of 2, repeat duration of 45 s, exclusion duration of 60 s, and exclusion size list of 150. Xcalibur software (Version 2.0.7, Thermo-Finnigan Inc., San Jose, CA) was used for instrument control, data acquisition, and data processing. Proteins were identified by comparing all of the experimental peptide MS/MS spectra to the Wormpep (November 1, 2010) using Mascot database search software (Version 2.1.04, Matrix Science, London, UK). The carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification, whereas the oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide and the modification of C-terminal lysine to heavy lysine were considered to be variable modifications. The mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm for the precursor ion and to 0.8 Da for the product ion. Strict Lys-C specificity was applied, and missed cleavages were not allowed. Peptides with at least six amino acid residues and with a minimum mascot score of 20 were considered significant. False discovery rate was calculated from N(decoy)·2/N(decoy) + N(target) and set to be at ≤0.01. The proteomics software Tool Suite Version 2.4.1 was used to calculate the labeled/unlabeled intensities of all peptides identified from the same protein. The protein ratios were calculated by use of an in-house software package written in Python. For each replicate, protein ratios were calculated from the observed intensities of labeled/unlabeled peptides. Consider a protein match with n peptide spectral matches. Let Ii,H and Ii,L (i = 1, 2, … , n) denote the observed intensities of ith peptide spectral match of the protein with and without isotope (13C6) labeling. A protein ratio, r, was calculated using linear regression Equation 1, r=∑i=1nIi,LIi,H∑i=1nIi,L2(Eq. 1) The standard error of this ratio is calculated by Equation 2, S=1n-1∑i=1n(Ii,H-rIi,L)2∑i=1nIi,L2(Eq. 2) To minimize inevitable systematic experimental variation, all protein ratios were normalized by tubulin within each replicate as shown in Equation 3, r~=rrtubulin S~=1rtubulinS(Eq. 3) The quantitative results from all replicates were merged into a single report. The mean ratio of a protein across m replicates is a weighted mean calculated as shown in Equation 4, r&macr;=∑j=1mr~jS~j2∑j=1m1S~j2(Eq. 4) and are the normalized ratio and its standard error of the protein from replicate j (j = 1, 2, … , m). The standard error for the weighted mean ratio is shown in Equation 5, Sr&macr;1∑j=1m(nj-1)-1{∑j=1m(nj-1)S~j2+∑j=1mnj(r~j-r~)2}(Eq. 5) where nj is the number of peptide spectral matches for the protein in replicate j, represents the variances within the replicates, and represents the variances between replicates. A hypothesis test was used to test whether the obtained protein ratios are statistically significant by the following Equation 6. p value=1.0-Ft(v)(|r&macr;-1.0|Sr~)(Eq. 6) where Ft(v) is the cumulative density function of the t distribution with a degree of freedom shown in Equation 7 v=∑j=1m(nj-1)-1(Eq. 7) Nematodes were washed three times with M9 buffer (32Brenner S. The genetics of Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and lysed in buffer A (15 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 44 mm glucose, and 1 mm DTT) containing a protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) followed by brief sonication (33Kim D.H. Feinbaum R. Alloing G. Emerson F.E. Garsin D.A. Inoue H. Tanaka-Hino M. Hisamoto N. Matsumoto K. Tan M.W. Ausubel F.M.

The rarity of spirals has been explained as a result of disks being dynamically 'hot' at z>2 which may instead favor the formation of commonly-observed clumpy structures. Alternatively, current instrumentation may simply not be sensitive enough to detect spiral structures comparable to those in the modern Universe. At redshifts <2, the velocity dispersion of disks decreases, and spiral galaxies are more numerous by z~1. Here we report observations of the grand design spiral galaxy Q2343-BX442 at z=2.18. Spectroscopy of ionized gas shows that the disk is dynamically hot, implying an uncertain origin for the spiral structure. The kinematics of the galaxy are consistent with a thick disk undergoing a minor merger, which can drive the formation of short-lived spiral structure. A duty cycle of < 100 Myr for such tidally-induced spiral structure in a hot massive disk is consistent with their rarity."

Uncontrolled FA release from WAT promotes lipotoxicity, which is characterized by inflammation and insulin resistance that leads to and worsens type 2 diabetes. Here we tested whether early diet-induced insulin resistance impairs the ability of hypothalamic insulin to regulate WAT lipolysis and thus contributes to adipose tissue dysfunction. To this end we fed male Sprague-Dawley rats a 10% lard diet (high fat diet (HFD)) for 3 consecutive days, which is known to induce systemic insulin resistance. Rats were studied by euglycemic pancreatic clamps and concomitant infusion of either insulin or vehicle into the mediobasal hypothalamus. Short term HFD feeding led to a 37% increase in caloric intake and elevated base-line free FAs and insulin levels compared with rats fed regular chow. Overfeeding did not impair insulin signaling in WAT, but it abolished the ability of mediobasal hypothalamus insulin to suppress WAT lipolysis and hepatic glucose production as assessed by glycerol and glucose flux. HFD feeding also increased hypothalamic levels of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol after only 3 days.

It acts as the primary storage site for excess energy in the form of triglycerides and releases FAs through lipolysis during fasting or times of high energy demand. The dynamic switching between energy storage and release according to metabolic needs is critical for lipid homeostasis.

In states of high energy demand, such as fasting or exercise, insulin levels are low, and increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) outflow induces lipolysis in WAT. The antilipolytic and prolipogenic effects of insulin are commonly attributed to the direct effects of insulin on adipocytes. We have recently demonstrated that in addition to its direct effects, insulin suppresses lipolysis and increases de novo lipogenesis in WAT also indirectly by reducing SNS outflow to WAT through hypothalamic insulin signaling (13Scherer T.

The antilipolytic properties of insulin are important in regulating hepatic glucose production (GP), because lipolysis provides the gluconeogenic precursor glycerol and energy substrates in the form of FAs to the liver (14Rebrin K.

Thus, unrestrained lipolysis increases gluconeogenesis and thereby hepatic glucose output. Because impaired hypothalamic insulin action can unrestrain WAT lipolysis (13Scherer T. O'Hare J.

Because increased lipolytic flux from WAT to the liver can drive gluconeogenesis, we asked whether short term overfeeding alters WAT and hepatic insulin action and whether this is associated with impaired hypothalamic insulin action. Experiments were performed in 10-week-old, standard chow-fed (Rodent Diet 5001; LabDiet, St. Louis, MO), male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), which were housed in a temperature- and light-controlled facility in separate cages. Prior to the clamp studies, we stereotaxically fit rats with indwelling cannulae targeting the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) as previously described (13Scherer T. O'Hare J. Diggs-Andrews K. Schweiger M. Cheng B. Lindtner C. Zielinski E. Vempati P. Su K. Dighe S. Milsom T. Puchowicz M. Scheja L. Zechner R. Fisher S.J. Previs S.F. Buettner C. Brain insulin controls adipose tissue lipolysis and lipogenesis.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We routinely injected food dye to verify placement of the cannulae. After a 1-week recovery period, we implanted carotid and jugular catheters for blood sampling and infusion during the pancreatic clamp studies. We allowed rats to recover for an additional 4–6 days and required them to return to within 10% of their presurgery body weight. After recovery we assigned rats to a HFD (Modified Lab w/10% Lard 57IR; LabDiet) or RC (Rodent Diet 5001; LabDiet) ad libitum for 3 consecutive days preceding the clamp studies. According to the manufacturer, the ingredients of the HFD are 90% Rodent Diet 5001 supplemented with 10% lard (w/w). Daily food intake was monitored by manually weighing the food pellets. All of the animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Rat clamp experiments and [3-3H]glucose and [2H-5]glycerol tracer studies were performed in conscious nonrestrained rats as previously described (13Scherer T. O'Hare J. Diggs-Andrews K. Schweiger M.

The rats were either fed RC or HFD for three consecutive days prior to the basal 1 milliunit·kg−1·min−1 pancreatic clamp studies. During the 6-h study protocol (see Fig. 1A), we either infused artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF, vehicle) (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) or human insulin (2 microunits; Humulin R diluted in aCSF (Lilly, Indianapolis IN)) at a rate of 0.18 μl/h per side for 6 h into the MBH. For the RC MBH insulin-infused group, we used controls from studies described in Ref. 13Scherer T. O'Hare J. Diggs-Andrews K. Schweiger M. Cheng B. Lindtner C. Zielinski E. Vempati P. Su K. Dighe S.

Conscious male rats, which were either fed a RC diet or a HFD for 3 consecutive days, were infused with either vehicle (aCSF) or insulin (2 microunits) directly into the MBH for 6 h. In this series the animals were not clamped. 15 min before the end of the study, the animals were injected with an intraperitoneal bolus of insulin (1 unit/kg of bodyweight in 5% glucose) or saline control, after which the animals were anesthetized and killed. Epidydimal fat pads were harvested, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and later analyzed by Western blot. Rats overfed for 3 days were subjected to 3 milliunits·kg−1·min−1 hyperinsulinemic clamp studies, during which [2H-5]glycerol tracer and either rimonabant (0.2 μg/μl dissolved in aCSF, 0.35% Me2SO, and 0.02% Tween 80) or vehicle (aCSF plus 0.35% Me2SO and 0.02% Tween 80) was infused directly into the third ventricle (intracerebroventricularly) as described in Ref. 20O'Hare J.D.

Two different lysis buffers (pH 7.4) were used: 1) 20 mm MOPS, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences) for Fig. 2 (A and B) and 2) 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (Cellgro, Manassas, VA), 1.25% CHAPS (Affymetrix, Cleveland, OH), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 8 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), and a Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Sciences) for Fig. 2 (C and D). This latter extraction seems to result in better extraction of large proteins such as fatty acid synthase in WAT, which was further enhanced by a 45-min solubilization step where homogenates were shaken at 4 °C before centrifugation. Primary antibodies against phospho-Akt 473 and 308, phospho-Hsl (Ser-563, Ser-565, and Ser-660) (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and β-actin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) were used. The membranes were scanned with the LI-COR Odyssey infrared scanner (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE), and band intensity was quantified with Odyssey 3.0 software on the basis of direct fluorescence measurement. All of the data are represented as the means ± S.E. Comparisons among groups were made using one-way analysis of variance followed by unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests. Repeated measures within the same group were compared by paired two-tailed Student's t tests. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. For Figs. 2 (F and G) and 4A, we used Pearson correlation and a two-tailed t test performed in Graphpad Prism 5.0b for Mac (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). To test whether short term overfeeding impairs the ability of MBH insulin to suppress lipolysis, we fed male SD rats either a highly palatable HFD (w/10% lard) or RC for 3 consecutive days. Rats fed a HFD increased their daily caloric intake by ∼30% (61 versus 83 kcal/day) compared with controls. Body weight, base-line plasma triglycerides, and free glycerol levels were not different between treatment groups because of the short duration of overfeeding (Table 1). Previous studies have shown that a similar increase in caloric intake impairs hepatic insulin action (16Wang J. Obici S. Morgan K. Barzilai N. Feng Z. Rossetti L.

Obici S. Morgan K. Barzilai N. Feng Z. Rossetti L. Overfeeding rapidly induces leptin and insulin resistance.Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2786-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Although in our studies insulin levels tended to be higher, this failed to reach statistical significance (Table 1). The fact that FA levels are not lower in the HFD group despite higher insulin levels indicates impaired WAT insulin action, which is an important cause of WAT dysfunction. To assess hypothalamic insulin action in this model, we performed basal 1 milliunits·kg−1·min−1 euglycemic clamp studies and simultaneously assessed lipolytic flux using a [2H-5]glycerol tracer, while infusing insulin or vehicle directly into the MBH (protocol outlined in Fig. 1A). In RC-fed rats, MBH insulin markedly suppressed lipolytic flux as assessed by the rate of appearance (Ra) of glycerol at base line and while using a euglycemic clamp (Fig. 1, B and C). However, voluntary overfeeding almost completely abolished the ability of MBH insulin to suppress WAT lipolysis (Fig. 1, B and C). This inability of MBH insulin to suppress lipolysis was also reflected in the lack of suppression of free FA levels during the MBH insulin infusions (Fig. 1D). We have previously shown that MBH insulin decreases the activation state of WAT hormone-sensitive lipase (Hsl) by suppressing phosphorylation on serine 563 and 660 as assessed by Western blot (13Scherer T. O'Hare J. Diggs-Andrews K. Schweiger M. Cheng B. Lindtner C. Zielinski E. Vempati P. Su K. Dighe S. Milsom T. Puchowicz M. Scheja L. Zechner R. Fisher S.J. Previs S.F. Buettner C.

After 3 days of overfeeding, phosphorylation of Hsl in WAT was unchanged in epidydimal WAT harvested at the end of the clamp (Fig. 2A). However, despite the impaired ability of brain insulin to suppress WAT lipolysis, insulin signaling in WAT was not decreased (Fig. 2B). This is in agreement with our previous studies where under RC conditions central insulin infusion did not affect peripheral insulin signaling in the adipose tissue (13Scherer T. O'Hare J.

One can argue that insulin signaling is not acutely induced at the end of a euglycemic basal insulin clamp, and therefore one may miss subtle differences of insulin signaling. We therefore acutely stimulated insulin signaling after a 6-h MBH infusion in an additional cohort of rats. Notably, we observed no differences in WAT (Fig. 2C) and liver (Fig. 2D) insulin signaling between RC and overfed rats as suggested by equal stimulability of Akt and suppressibility of Hsl phosphorylation. This indicates that insulin signaling in peripheral organs such as WAT and liver is still intact after 3 days of overfeeding and that hypothalamic insulin signaling does not alter peripheral insulin signaling, which is in agreement with our prior studies and those of others (13Scherer T.

Open table in a new tab Thus, the effects of central insulin on WAT metabolism can occur independently of alterations of WAT insulin signaling, and thus WAT insulin action can be compromised in the absence of a peripheral insulin signaling defect. Protein expression of Atgl (adipose tissue triglyceride lipase) and ABHD5 (α/β hydrolase domain containing protein 5; also known as CGI-58, for comparative gene identification-58), an activator of Atgl, was not different between groups (data not shown), although this does not rule out the possibility that Atgl activity was altered by MBH insulin. Furthermore, overfeeding resulted in elevated base-line free FA levels (Table 1), despite comparable lipolytic rates. Plasma free FAs are only an indirect measure of lipolysis, because free FA levels are also a function of differences in FA utilization and uptake. Because it has been shown in mice that brain insulin is also able to increase FA uptake into WAT (29Coomans C.P. Geerling J.J. Guigas B. van den Hoek A.M. Parlevliet E.T. Ouwens D.M. Pijl H.

Insulin levels in the HFD-fed rats were moderately increased during the base-line period, consistent with systemic insulin resistance (Figs. 2E). Notably, at base-line and during the clamp period (during which insulin levels were controlled and not different between groups), the Ra glycerol positively correlated with the caloric intake in the HFD-fed rats (Fig. 2, F and G).

MIN6 cells secrete insulin in response to glucose and other secretagogues, but high passage (HP) MIN6 cells lose their ability to secrete insulin in response to glucose. We hypothesized that metabolism of glucose and lipids were defective in HP MIN6 cells causing impaired glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). HP MIN6 cells had no first phase and impaired second phase GSIS indicative of global functional impairment. This was coupled with a markedly reduced ATP content at basal and glucose stimulated states. Glucose uptake and oxidation were higher at basal glucose but ATP content failed to increase with glucose. HP MIN6 cells had decreased basal lipid oxidation. This was accompanied by reduced expressions of Glut1, Gck, Pfk, Srebp1c, Ucp2, Sirt3, Nampt. MIN6 cells represent an important model of beta cells which, as passage numbers increased lost first phase but retained partial second phase GSIS, similar to patients early in type 2 diabetes onset. We believe a number of gene expression changes occurred to produce this defect, with emphasis on Sirt3 and Nampt, two genes that have been implicated in maintenance of glucose homeostasis."

It has been well established that T helper 1 (Th1) cells producing interferon (IFN)-γ play a central role in host resistance to M. tuberculosis infection (9Flynn J.L. Chan J.

Consequently, interleukin (IL)-12-, IL-12 receptor-, signal transducer of activation and transcription (STAT)-4-, and T-bet-deficient animals, which are defective in the generation of Th1 responses, are highly susceptible to M. tuberculosis infection (9Flynn J.L.

Active tuberculosis in Africa is associated with reduced Th1 and increased Th2 activity in vivo.Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Similarly, individuals with mutations in IL-12 or its signaling components are highly susceptible to M. tuberculosis infection (12Cooper A.M. Solache A. Khader S.A.

Interleukin-12 and the regulation of innate resistance and adaptive immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar).

Immunol. 2002; 168: 4636-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). On the other hand, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β produced by the infected cells directs the differentiation of induced regulatory T cells (Tregs) (15Chen W. Konkel J.E.

In fact, it has been shown that Tregs are induced during the progression of TB, and this is associated with inhibition of protective T cell responses in the host (18Kursar M. Koch M. Mittrücker H.W.

M. tuberculosis-infected cells also produce IL-6, which, in combination with TGF-β, provides favorable conditions for the differentiation of Th17 cells (20Bettelli E. Carrier Y. Gao W. Korn T.

All Th cell subsets, including Th1 cells, Th2 cells, Th17 cells, and Tregs are in a dynamic balance, and it has been therefore assumed that impaired Th1 responses during the progression of TB are associated with increased Th2 responses. However, the cytokines produced by the infected cells that play a role in the development of Th2 responses during progression of TB have not been identified. It has previously been shown that M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages produce copious amounts of IL-1β (22Juffermans N.P. Florquin S. Camoglio L. Verbon A. Kolk A.H.

Immunol. 2010; 184: 3326-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). IL-1β plays an important role in the differentiation of Th2 cells (24Ben-Sasson S.Z. Hu-Li J. Quiel J. Cauchetaux S. Ratner M. Shapira I. Dinarello C.A. Paul W.E. IL-1 acts directly on CD4 T cells to enhance their antigen-driven expansion and differentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7119-7124Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether IL-1β produced by infected phagocytes is responsible for Th2 cell differentiation during progression of TB. We observed that dendritic cells (DCs) infected with the virulent M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv induced copious amounts of IL-1β, whereas the vaccine strain bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and M. tuberculosis strains carrying mutations in the region of difference (RD)-1 (H37RvΔRD-1) or early secretory antigenic target (ESAT)-6 (H37RvΔESAT-6) failed to induce IL-1β. Importantly, complementation of H37RvΔESAT-6 with ESAT-6 restored IL-1β production in DCs. On the other hand, H37Rv, BCG, and all H37Rv mutants induced comparable amounts of IL-12. H37Rv-infected DCs induced both IFN-γ- and IL-4-producing CD4+ T cells, whereas BCG, H37RvΔRD-1, and H37RvΔESAT-6 selectively induced IFN-γ-producing cells. We confirmed these findings by adoptive transfer experiments with naïve CD4+ T cells isolated from IL-1βR knock-out mice. Taken together, our findings indicate that IL-1β produced by infected phagocytes plays an important role in Th2 cell differentiation during TB. Animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee meeting held on November 22, 2007 at ICGEB (approval ID; ICGEB/IAEC/IMM-13/2007), New Delhi, India, and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) guidelines, Government of India. All mice used for experiments were ethically killed by asphyxiation in carbon dioxide according to institutional and DBT regulations. C57BL/6 and OT-II T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice (6–8 weeks of age) were initially purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. IL-1βR−/− mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. All animals were subsequently bred and maintained in the animal facility of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), New Delhi, India. M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv was a kind gift from the Colorado State University repository. BCG, H37RvΔRD-1, H37RvΔESAT-6, and ESAT-6-complemented H37RvΔESAT-6 were a kind gift from Prof. David Sherman (SBRI, Seattle, WA). All mycobacterial strains were grown in 7H9 (Middlebrook, Difco) medium supplemented with 10% ADC (albumin, dextrose, and catalase; Difco) and with 0.05% Tween 80 and 0.2% glycerol, and cultures were grown to mid-log phase. Aliquots of the cultures in 20% glycerol were preserved at −80 °C, and these cryopreserved stocks were used for infections. Luminex kits were purchased from Bio-Rad. Granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-4 were obtained from R&D Biosystems. Purified anti-mouse IL-1β antibody (clone B122) was purchased from e-Biosciences. Mice were euthanized, and the femurs were isolated. Bone marrow was flushed out with RPMI 1640 medium using a 2.0-ml syringe (26.5 gauge). The cells were washed twice with PBS and then cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with GM-CSF (40 ng/ml) and IL-4 (10 ng/ml) on 24-well plates (1 million cells/ml). On the 3rd day, 75% of the medium was replaced with fresh DC culture medium. On day 5, the suspended cells were removed, and the loosely adherent cells were collected as immature DCs (CD11c-positive cells were >90%). For mature DCs, immature DCs were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 μg/ml) for 24 h. FACS analysis using anti-CD11c, -CD80, -CD86, and -MHC class II antibodies suggested that >95% of the cells were conventional DCs. Bone marrow cells were isolated from mice (C57BL/6), differentiated into immature DCs as described above, and cultured in 24-well plates (1 × 106 cells/well). Cells were infected with H37Rv, H37RvΔRD-1, BCG, H37RvΔESAT-6, or ESAT-6-complemented H37RvΔESAT-6 (multiplicity of infection of 1:10). Supernatants from cells were collected at 24, 48, and 72 h for cytokine profiling. For T cell differentiation, CD4+ T cells (1 × 106) were purified by magnetic activated cell sorting method (CD4+ T cell isolation beads kit; Miltenyi Biotech) from OT-II TCR transgenic mice and co-cultured with immature DCs (1 × 106) infected with H37Rv, H37RvΔRD-1, BCG, H37RvΔESAT-6, or ESAT-6-complemented H37RvΔESAT-6 in the presence of ovalbumin (10 μg/ml) peptide (Thermo Scientific) for 72 h. Then, CD4+ T cells were harvested and subjected to intracellular staining for IL-4 and IFN-γ expression. Mice (C57BL/6) used for these experiments were infected with H37Rv, H37RvΔRD-1, H37RvΔESAT-6, BCG, or ESAT-6-complemented H37RvΔESAT-6 through the aerosol route. Cytokines in the culture supernatant of DCs were assayed by a Luminex microbead-based multiplexed assay using commercially available kits according to the manufacturer's protocol (BioPlex, Bio-Rad). For depletion of IL-1β, we cultured cells in the presence of anti-IL-1β mAb (10 μg/ml) and collected the supernatant for cytokine profiling after different time points. For adoptive transfer experiments, Thy1.1+ mice were γ-irradiated (8 rads/s for 100 s) and rested for a day. CD4+ T cells, isolated from lymph nodes of IL-1R−/− mice (Thy1.2+ background) were then adoptively transferred into the irradiated recipient mice (2–4 × 106 cells/mouse). After 15 days recipient mice were challenged with H37Rv through the aerosol route. For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 500 ng/ml ionomycin in the presence of 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich) added during the last 6 h of culture. Cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in a permeabilization buffer (Cytofix/Cytoperm kit; BD Biosciences) and stained with the following fluorescently conjugated monoclonal antibodies: anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5)-allophycocyanin, anti-IFN-γ (clone XMG1.2)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), anti-IFN-γ (clone XMG1.2)- allophycocyanin, anti-IL-4 (clone GK1.5)-phycoerythrin (eBiosciences). Fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur or FACS CantoII; BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed with FlowJo (Tree star). DCs derived from C57BL/6 mice were infected with H37Rv or H37RvΔESAT-6. For T cell differentiation, CD4+ T cells (1 × 106) were purified by magnetic activated cell sorting from OT-II TCR transgenic mice and co-cultured with DCs (1 × 106) infected with H37Rv or H37RvΔESAT-6 in the presence of ovalbumin peptide (5 μg/ml). Whole cell lysate was prepared by using lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) along with HALTTM phosphatase inhibitor mixture (78420; Thermo Scientific) and protease inhibitor mixture (78410; Thermo Scientific) for 1 h. Samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Blots were blocked for 1 h in 5% BSA in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20). STAT6, pSTAT6, STAT4, and pSTAT4 proteins were detected with anti-STAT6 (Sc-621), -pSTAT6 (Sc-11762-R), -STAT4 (Sc-486) and -pSTAT4 (Sc-16317-R) polyclonal antibodies, respectively, at a dilution of 1:250 and as recommended by the manufacturer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Sc-2004) (diluted 1:2500) was used as a secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoblotting for GAPDH was carried out to confirm equal loading. All data were derived from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS10 software, and values were presented as mean ± S.D. Significant differences between the groups were determined by ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test (SPSS software). A value of p < 0.05 was accepted as an indication of statistical significance. It is now well established that Th1 cell responses play a protective role (10Sweeney K.A. Dao D.N. Goldberg M.F. Hsu T.

Despite adequate Th1 cell responses, M. tuberculosis continues to progress toward disease in susceptible hosts, suggesting that Th1 immunity is not sufficient for optimal host protection. Differentiation of Th1 and Th2 subsets requires IL-12 and IL-4, respectively (14Hickman S.P. Chan J. Salgame P.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 4636-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 27Noben-Trauth N. Hu-Li J. Paul W.E. IL-4 secreted from individual naïve CD4+ T cells acts in an autocrine manner to induce Th2 differentiation.Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1428-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Whereas IL-12 produced by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) drives Th1 cell differentiation (13Trinchieri G. Interleukin-12 and the regulation of innate resistance and adaptive immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar), professional APCs do not produce IL-4. However, it has been shown that under some circumstances, IL-1β produced by APCs plays an important role in Th2 cell differentiation (28Hebel K. Rudolph M. Kosak B. Chang H.D. Butzmann J. Brunner-Weinzierl M.C. IL-1β and TGF-β act antagonistically in induction and differentially in propagation of human proinflammatory precursor CD4+ T cells.J.

Immunol. 2007; 19: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the cytokines produced by M. tuberculosis- or BCG-infected DCs. We generated bone marrow-derived DCs from C57BL/6 mice and infected these cells with H37Rv or BCG. We determined the T cell-polarizing cytokines IL-12 and IL-1β. We found that both H37Rv and BCG induced IL-12 whereas only H37Rv induced IL-1β (Fig. 1A). We next determined whether these infected DCs differentially facilitate the differentiation of Th cells. To test this hypothesis, we co-cultured CD4+ T cells isolated from OT-II TCR transgenic mice in the presence of ovalbumin peptide. We observed that H37Rv-infected DCs induced large amounts of both IFN-γ and IL-4, whereas BCG-infected DCs induced only IFN-γ in T cells (Fig 1B). This observation suggests that M. tuberculosis induces either Th0 cells, which produce both IFN-γ and IL-4, or induce distinct populations of Th1 (IFN-γ producers) and Th2 (IL-4 producers) cells. Therefore, to distinguish between these possibilities, we performed intracellular staining of CD4+ T cells for IFN-γ and IL-4 production. We found that H37Rv induced few if any CD4+ T cells producing both IFN-γ and IL-4 simultaneously. In sharp contrast, BCG induced IFN-γ-producing cells only (Fig. 1C). From the preceding section it was clear that H37Rv induces both Th1 and Th2 responses, whereas BCG selectively induces Th1 responses. Compared with H37Rv, BGC lacks several genomic segments that are called regions of difference (RD), and a total of 22 such RD regions have been characterized. Among them, RD-1 has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis and its capacity to subvert the immune system (30Guinn K.M. Hickey M.J. Mathur S.K. Zakel K.L. Grotzke J.E. Lewinsohn D.M. Smith S. Sherman D.R. Individual RD1-region genes are required for export of ESAT-6/CFP-10 and for virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Mol.

Dis. 2004; 190: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether RD-1 has a role in inducing IL-1β in DCs and to promote Th2 cell responses. ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are two important antigenic proteins encoded within the RD-1 region that are secreted as a complex. Thus, mutation in either protein impairs formation and secretion of the complex (30Guinn K.M. Hickey M.J. Mathur S.K. Zakel K.L. Grotzke J.E. Lewinsohn D.M. Smith S. Sherman D.R.

Immunol. 2005; 174: 3570-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, to understand the role of RD-1 we performed experiments with deletion mutants of H37Rv in RD-1 (H37RvΔRD-1) or ESAT-6 (H37RvΔESAT-6). Interestingly, neither the H37RvΔRD-1 mutant nor the H37RvΔESAT-6 mutant was able to induce IL-1β, whereas both mutants induced levels of IL-12 comparable with H37Rv and BCG (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these observations indicated that the RD-1 of H37Rv plays an important role in the production of IL-1β by infected DCs, but has little if any role in the production of IL-12 (Fig. 2A). Next we tested whether cytokines (and possibly IL-1β) produced by the H37Rv-infected DCs assist in the differentiation of Th2 cells. For this purpose, we co-cultured naïve CD4+ T cells from OT-II TCR transgenic mice with infected DCs pulsed with ovalbumin peptide. We determined cytokines produced in the culture supernatant as well as cytokines produced by the cells intracellularly. We found that DCs infected with H37Rv induced both IL-4- and IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells whereas BCG-infected DCs selectively induced IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2B). These observations clearly indicate that the RD-1 region of virulent strain H37Rv plays a dominant role in inducing Th2 responses. To investigate further the role of IL-1β in Th2 cell differentiation induced by H37Rv, we performed T cell co-culture experiments with infected DCs in the presence of anti-IL-1β antibodies. Neutralization of IL-1β with antibody dramatically abrogated IL-4 production by CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, DCs infected with BCG, H37RvΔRD-1, or H37RvΔESAT-6 mutants selectively induced IFN-γ production, and this was not affected by anti-IL-1β antibodies, which thus served as a negative control (Fig. 3B). We also neutralized IL-1β in co-cultures of T cells with DCs infected with RD-1-complemented BCG. Similar to the results obtained for H37Rv, we found that neutralization of IL-1β dramatically abrogated Th2 cell differentiation induced by RD-1-complemented BCG. To confirm these findings, we investigated the molecular mechanism of Th cell differentiation in infected DCs co-cultured with T cells. For this purpose, we performed Western blot analysis of STAT6, pSTAT6, STAT4, and pSTAT4 proteins in OT-II CD4+ T cells from cultures with infected DCs. We observed phosphorylation of STAT-6 in CD4+ T cells co-cultured with H37Rv-infected DCs, and this was dramatically reduced when IL-1β was neutralized by antibodies (Fig. 3C). In contrast, CD4+ T cells co-cultured with H37RvΔESAT-6 were unable to induce STAT-6 phosphorylation. We also examined STAT-4 phosphorylation and found an opposite pattern (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that IL-1β plays an important role in Th2 cell polarization during M. tuberculosis infection and that ESAT-6 or factors controlled by ESAT-6 are responsible for induction of IL-1β. Next, we complemented our in vitro finding showing that the RD-1 region of virulent strain H37Rv induces IL-1β to promote Th2 cell differentiation, with in vivo experiments. We also performed cytokine profiling studies of lung homogenates obtained from C57BL/6 mice infected with H37Rv, BCG, or H37RvΔESAT-6. Consistent with our in vitro data, we observed that H37Rv-infected animals produced both IL-4 and IFN-γ, whereas BCG-infected animals induced only IFN-γ at all time points analyzed (Fig. 4A). To obtain further information about the relevant T cell-differentiating cytokines, we determined the levels of IL-12 and IL-1β, as in our in vitro experiments. We detected both IL-1β and IL-12 in lung homogenates from H37Rv-infected mice, whereas BCG-infected animals selectively produced IL-12, at levels similar to H37Rv-infected animals (Fig. 4A). We also determined cytokines in the lung homogenates of animals infected with H37RvΔRD-1 or H37RvΔESAT-6. As expected, both groups of infected animals produced IL-12 and IFN-γ but not IL-1β in their lungs (Fig 4B). In contrast, RD-1 complemented BCG-induced IL-12 as well as IL-1β, and both IFN-γ and IL-4 were present (Fig. 4B). Collectively these data indicate that the RD-1 region plays an important role in the induction of IL-1β by H37Rv-infected DCs, which in turn drives Th2 cell differentiation. To provide further evidence that IL-1β plays an important role in the differentiation of Th2 cells in M. tuberculosis-infected animals, we isolated CD4+ T cells from congenic wild-type Thy1.2 or IL-1βR−/− Thy1.2 mice and adoptively transferred these cells into irradiated Thy1.1 congenic animals followed by infection with H37Rv. Thirty days after infection, spleen cells from these animals were isolated and challenged with H37Rv complete soluble antigen ex vivo, and we stained T cells for the intracellular cytokines IL-4 and IFN-γ. Cytokines produced by adoptively transferred CD4+ T cells were determined by gating on Thy1.2. We observed that CD4+ T cells from wild-type animals had adopted a phenotype characterized by IFN-γ or IL-4 production. In contrast, CD4+ T cells from IL-1βR−/− mice differentiated predominantly into IFN-γ-producing cells (Fig. 5). Therefore, we conclude that IL-1β produced during the progression of TB disease is responsible for the generation of Th2 cell responses. M. tuberculosis survives within susceptible hosts by altering host protective Th cell responses. IFN-γ-induced macrophage activation that results in the production of nitric oxide radicals is the key mechanism for elimination of the harbored pathogens. Thus, animals that are defective in the production of IL-12, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, IFN-γ, or proteins involved in their signaling pathways exhibit increased susceptibility to M. tuberculosis infection (34Flynn J.L. Chan J. Triebold K.J. Dalton D.K. Stewart T.A. Bloom B.R. An essential role for interferon γ in resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). However, M. tuberculosis successfully inhibits IL-12 production in susceptible hosts and thus inhibits the development of Th1 responses (35Pathak S.K. Basu S. Bhattacharyya A. Pathak S. Kundu M. Basu J. Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan-mediated IRAK-M induction negatively regulates Toll-like receptor-dependent interleukin-12 p40 production in macrophages.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42794-42800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, it has clearly been shown that M. tuberculosis not only prevents Th1 responses, but also facilitates Th2 responses (36Rook G.A. Th2 cytokines in susceptibility to tuberculosis.Curr. Mol. Med. 2007; 7: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which counterregulate host protective Th1 responses. Phagocytes, the natural home for M. tuberculosis, are the predominant source of IL-12 that drives Th1 cell differentiation. In contrast, IL-4, the key cytokine required for the differentiation of Th2 cells, is not produced by APCs. Thus, it is likely that another cytokine is involved in promoting Th2 cell differentiation during the progression of TB. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that IL-1β can act as a co-stimulatory factor for Th2 cells (29Mejri N. Brossard M. Splenic dendritic cells pulsed with Ixodes ricinus tick saliva prime naïve CD4+ T to induce Th2 cell differentiation in vitroin vivo.Int. Immunol. 2007; 19: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that IL-1β is induced by M. tuberculosis-infected DCs. We further showed that IL-1β is directly involved in Th2 cell differentiation during M. tuberculosis infection. Therefore, it appears that M. tuberculosis ensures survival not only by directly inhibiting Th1 responses, but also indirectly by mounting Th2 responses. In fact, it has been reported that inhibition of Th2 responses or genetic deficiency in the generation of Th2 responses confers partial resistance to M. tuberculosis infection (37Potian J.A. Rafi W. Bhatt K. McBride A. Gause W.C. Salgame P. Preexisting helminth infection induces inhibition of innate pulmonary anti-tuberculosis defense by engaging the IL-4 receptor pathway.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been shown that IL-1β-mediated signaling plays an important role in host resistance to M. tuberculosis infection (22Juffermans N.P. Florquin S. Camoglio L. Verbon A. Kolk A.H. Speelman P. van Deventer S.J. van Der Poll T. Interleukin-1 signaling is essential for host defense during murine pulmonary tuberculosis.J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 182: 902-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 38Wilkinson R.J. Patel P. Llewelyn M. Hirsch C.S. Pasvol G. Snounou G. Davidson R.N. Toossi Z. Influence of polymorphism in the genes for the interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist and IL-1β on tuberculosis.J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In fact, IL-1β- and IL-1βR-deficient animals have increased susceptibility to M. tuberculosis infection (39Yamada H. Mizumo S. Horai R. Iwakura Y. Sugawara I. Protective role of interleukin-1 in mycobacterial infection in IL-1 α/β double-knockout mice.Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice deficient in the IL-1β signaling adaptor molecule MyD88 are highly susceptible to M. tuberculosis infection (40Fremond C.M. Togbe D. Doz E. Rose S. Vasseur V. Maillet I. Jacobs M. Ryffel B. Quesniaux V.F. IL-1 receptor-mediated signal is an essential component of MyD88-dependent innate response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 1178-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, the precise nature of the host protective immune responses induced by IL-1β during M. tuberculosis infection is unclear. Our results demonstrate that IL-1β induces Th2 cell differentiation, which has been shown to promote progression of TB by inhibiting host protective Th1 responses (11Lienhardt C. Azzurri A. Amedei A. Fielding K. Sillah J. Sow O.Y. Bah B. Benagiano M. Diallo A. Manetti R. Manneh K. Gustafson P. Bennett S. D'Elios M.M. McAdam K. Del Prete G. Active tuberculosis in Africa is associated with reduced Th1 and increased Th2 activity in vivo.Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, IL-1β might originate two divergent immune responses: (i) IL-1β might induce the MyD88 signaling pathway to promote protective innate host immune responses; and (ii) IL-1β might have a direct role in the differentiation of Th2 cells, which counterregulates protective host adaptive immune responses. Therefore, it will be of future interest to delineate the conditions and mechanisms by which IL-1β elicits these divergent responses. Previously, we have shown that BCG, M. tuberculosis H37Rv, and mutant strains H37RvΔRD-1 and H37RvΔESAT-6 induce IL-12 in DCs in a Toll-like receptor-2-independent but MyD88-dependent manner (41Chatterjee S. Dwivedi V.P. Singh Y. Siddiqui I. Sharma P. Van Kaer L. Chattopadhyay D. Das G. Early secreted antigen ESAT-6 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis promotes protective T helper 17 cell responses in a toll-like receptor-2-dependent manner.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002378Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), suggesting that production of IL-12 is independent of RD-1. In this report we have shown that IL-1β production is dependent on RD-1/ESAT-6. Thus, M. tuberculosis has at least two different sets of factors that control IL-12 and IL-1β production to modulate Th cell differentiation during the progression of TB. Furthermore, it is known that Tregs also assist in the progression of TB (19Shafiani S. Tucker-Heard G. Kariyone A. Takatsu K. Urdahl K.B. Pathogen-specific regulatory T cells delay the arrival of effector T cells in the lung during early tuberculosis.J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), whereas the role of Th17 cells remains unclear and might differ during primary and secondary infection (41Chatterjee S. Dwivedi V.P. Singh Y. Siddiqui I. Sharma P. Van Kaer L. Chattopadhyay D. Das G. Early secreted antigen ESAT-6 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis promotes protective T helper 17 cell responses in a toll-like receptor-2-dependent manner.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002378Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that Th1 cells are protective whereas Th2 cells and Tregs promote disease. These Th cell subsets are in a dynamic balance during M. tuberculosis infection. In this context, it has been recently shown that mycobacterial strains that can mount Th1 responses but are defective in the induction of Th2 cells or Tregs exhibit dramatically increased vaccine efficacy (36Rook G.A. Th2 cytokines in susceptibility to tuberculosis.Curr. Mol. Med. 2007; 7: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 42Koch M.A. Tucker-Heard G. Perdue N.R. Killebrew J.R. Urdahl K.B. Campbell D.J. The transcription factor T-bet controls regulatory T cell homeostasis and function during type 1 inflammation.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, our recent data indicate that animals that are unable to mount Th2 cells and Tregs (STAT-6−/−TGF-βRIIDN mice) are completely resistant to M. tuberculosis infection. 4D. Bhattacharya and G. Das, unpublished observations. Therefore, in future studies it will be interesting to identify the components that are responsible for the induction of Th2 cells and Tregs, which will enable us to design improved vaccines and therapies. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the RD-1 region of M. tuberculosis is responsible for the capacity of this organism to promote Th2 cell differentiation. One of our future goals will be to identify the bacterial component(s) that induce(s) Tregs during TB disease. Our findings suggest that M. tuberculosis mutants that are defective in the induction of both Th2 cells and Tregs may serve as superior vaccines."

Using reconstituted giant unilamellar vesicles containing preassembled t-SNARE proteins (syntaxin 1·SNAP-25), we determined how Munc18-1 controls the docking, priming, and fusion of small unilamellar vesicles containing the v-SNARE VAMP2 and the Ca(2+) sensor synaptotagmin 1. In vitro assays allowed us to position Munc18-1 in the center of a sequential reaction cascade; vesicle docking by synaptotagmin 1 is a prerequisite for Munc18-1 to accelerate trans-SNARE complex (SNAREpin) assembly and membrane fusion. Complexin II stalls SNAREpin zippering at a late stage and, hence, contributes to synchronize membrane fusion in a Ca(2+)- and synaptotagmin 1-dependent manner. Thus, at the neuronal synapse, the priming factor Munc18-1 may accelerate the conversion of docked synaptic vesicles into a readily releasable pool by activating SNAREs for efficient membrane fusion."

A distinct class of c-di-GMP effector consists of molecules that can bind c-di-GMP through an RXXD motif that resembles the I-site of the GGDEF domain of DGCs, but do not show catalytic activity as their active sites lack the requisite GGDEF motif. Examples include PelD from P. aeruginosa (42Lee V.T. Matewish J.M. Kessler J.L. Hyodo M. Hayakawa Y. Lory S. A cyclic di-GMP receptor required for bacterial exopolysaccharide production.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1474-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), CdgG from V. cholera (43Beyhan S. Odell L.S. Yildiz F.H.

Second messenger-mediated spatiotemporal control of protein degradation regulates bacterial cell cycle progression.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In contrast to the effectors described in the previous paragraph, biochemical data for I-site-containing c-di-GMP effectors is sparse, and there are no crystal structures available for any members of this receptor class. PelD is found in the Pel pathway involved in the formation of pellicles, one of the major biofilm types formed by P. aeruginosa (44Friedman L. Kolter R. Genes involved in matrix formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 biofilms.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 675-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The Pel pathway synthesizes and exports PEL polysaccharides that play both structural and protective roles in P. aeruginosa biofilms (45Colvin K.M. Gordon V.D. Murakami K. Borlee B.R. Wozniak D.J. Wong G.C. Parsek M.R. The pel polysaccharide can serve a structural and protective role in the biofilm matrix of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1001264Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). This pathway contains seven proteins, namely PelABCDEFG, which are highly conserved in diverse microbes (44Friedman L. Kolter R. Genes involved in matrix formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 biofilms.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 675-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), and have been shown to be functionally conserved (46Vasseur P. Vallet-Gely I. Soscia C. Genin S. Filloux A. The pel genes of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK strain are involved at early and late stages of biofilm formation.Microbiology. 2005; 151: 985-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although a few attempts were made to assign functions to the seven proteins (44Friedman L. Kolter R. Genes involved in matrix formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 biofilms.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 675-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 46Vasseur P. Vallet-Gely I. Soscia C. Genin S. Filloux A.

PelC is a Pseudomonas aeruginosa outer membrane lipoprotein of the OMA family of proteins involved in exopolysaccharide transport.Biochimie. 2007; 89: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the mechanism of polysaccharides production by this pathway remains largely unknown. Interestingly, the pellicle formation of P. aeruginosa was implied to be stimulated by c-di-GMP (11Kulasakara H. Lee V. Brencic A. Liberati N. Urbach J. Miyata S. Lee D.G. Neely A.N. Hyodo M. Hayakawa Y. Ausubel F.M. Lory S. Analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases reveals a role for bis-(3′–5′)-cyclic-GMP in virulence.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Subsequently, PelD was shown to be the receptor of c-di-GMP in the Pel pathway and c-di-GMP binding to PelD is essential to pellicle production (42Lee V.T. Matewish J.M. Kessler J.L. Hyodo M. Hayakawa Y. Lory S. A cyclic di-GMP receptor required for bacterial exopolysaccharide production.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1474-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In vivo studies showed that c-di-GMP enhanced the transcription level of pel genes and deletion of pelD genes rendered P. aeruginosa PA14 incapable of producing pellicles (42Lee V.T. Matewish J.M. Kessler J.L. Hyodo M. Hayakawa Y. Lory S. A cyclic di-GMP receptor required for bacterial exopolysaccharide production.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1474-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In vitro biochemical assays showed that PelD is the only protein in the Pel pathway that binds c-di-GMP (42Lee V.T. Matewish J.M. Kessler J.L. Hyodo M. Hayakawa Y. Lory S. A cyclic di-GMP receptor required for bacterial exopolysaccharide production.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1474-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). PelD is predicted to be an inner membrane protein with four transmembrane helices and a large cytosolic region (42Lee V.T. Matewish J.M. Kessler J.L. Hyodo M. Hayakawa Y. Lory S. A cyclic di-GMP receptor required for bacterial exopolysaccharide production.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1474-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 44Friedman L. Kolter R. Genes involved in matrix formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 biofilms.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 675-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Remarkably, it is proposed to bind c-di-GMP through an I-site-like motif and thus represent a novel family of c-di-GMP-binding proteins (42Lee V.T. Matewish J.M. Kessler J.L. Hyodo M. Hayakawa Y. Lory S. A cyclic di-GMP receptor required for bacterial exopolysaccharide production.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1474-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Mutation of residues in the I-site-like motif abolished the binding of PelD to c-di-GMP and in vivo assays showed that these PelD mutants lack the ability to restore pellicle formation and Congo red binding by P. aeruginosa PA14, indicating that binding of c-di-GMP to PelD is required for pellicle production. Here, we present structural, biochemical, and mutational analyses of a soluble, cytosolic domain of PelD from P. aeruginosa PAO1 that harbors all of the necessary elements for c-di-GMP recognition. We have determined the crystal structures of this cytosolic domain both alone and in complex with c-di-GMP (each to 2.0 Å resolution), as well as that of a deletion variant in complex with c-di-GMP (to 1.7-Å resolution). Utilizing the structural data as a guide, we have carried out structure-function analysis of a number of residues at the c-di-GMP binding site and have quantitatively assessed their roles in ligand binding. The combined structural and biochemical data expand upon the current knowledge of c-di-GMP receptors and provide the first structural view of a c-di-GMP effector that recognizes cognate ligand only through the I-site. PelD158-CT was cloned into pET28 vector and expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta2. Wild type and mutant proteins were purified using an Ni-NTA affinity column followed by size exclusion chromatography in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl. Protein was concentrated to 20–30 mg/ml and kept at 4 °C. Protein was precipitated when stored in this condition but became soluble again at room temperature. The protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using an calculated extinction coefficient, 11,920 m−1 cm−1. PelD158-CT crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. Each hanging drop contained 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of mother liquor. The mother liquor conditions are as follows. (i) PelD158-CT apo: 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mm MgCl2, and 10% (v/v) PEG 8000; (ii) PelD158-CT wild type in complex with c-di-GMP (two molecules in the asymmetric unit): 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 200 mm Li2SO4, and 1.26 m (NH4)2SO4; (iii) PelD158-CT wild type or Δ-loop mutant in complex with c-di-GMP (1 molecule in the asymmetric unit): 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 10 mm MgSO4, 1.3 m Li2SO4. The protein concentration was 2–5 mg/ml in all cases. For co-crystallization, 2 mm c-di-GMP was incubated with the protein at room temperature for 30 min prior to crystallization. Crystals were cryo-protected in 15% ethylene glycol before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Initial crystallographic studies were carried out using a construct that spanned residues Ile144 (PelD144-CT) through the C terminus. Flash-cooled crystals of PelD144-CT diffract x-rays beyond a Bragg spacing of 2.5 Å, using an insertion device x-ray beam line (LS-CAT, Sector 21ID, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL). A mercury derivative was prepared by treating crystals with 5 mm ethylmercury bromide for 24 h. Crystallographic phases were determined by single wavelength anomalous diffraction from the mercurial derivative. A 4-fold redundant data set was collected at 100 K to a limiting resolution of 2.6 Å (overall Rmerge = 9.2%, I/σ(I) = 1.8 in the highest resolution shell). All diffraction data were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 package (49Otwinowski Z. Borek D. Majewski W. Minor W. Multiparametric scaling of diffraction intensities.Acta Crystallogr.

We aimed to assess if an association between SES and HCC survival existed in the Canadian context.We conducted a population-based cohort study linking HCC cases identified in the Ontario Cancer Registry between 1990 and 2009 to administrative and hospital data. Logistic regression and chi-squared tests were used to evaluate associations between SES (income quintile) and covariates. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival. Sequential analysis of the proportional-hazards models were used to determine the association between SES and HCC survival controlling for potential prognostic covariates. During the period 1990-2009, 5,481 cases of HCC were identified. A significant association was found between SES and curative treatment (p = 0.0003), but no association was found between SES and non-curative treatment (p = 0.064), palliative treatment (p = 0.680), or ultrasound screening (p = 0.615). The median survival for the lowest SES was 8.5 months, compared to 8.8 months for the highest SES group. The age- and sex-adjusted proportional-hazards model showed statistically significant difference in HCC survival among the SES groups, with hazard ratio 0.905 (95% confidence intervals 0.821, 0.998) when comparing highest to lowest SES group. Further adjustments indicated that potentially curative treatment was the likely explanation for the association between SES and HCC survival.Our findings suggest that a 10% HCC survival advantage exists for the higher SES groups. This association between SES and HCC survival is most likely a reflection of lack of access to care for low SES groups, revealing inequities in the Canadian healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W2055315287,"UDP-xylose synthase (UXS) catalyzes decarboxylation of UDP-D-glucuronic acid to UDP-xylose. In mammals, UDP-xylose serves to initiate glycosaminoglycan synthesis on the protein core of extracellular matrix proteoglycans. Lack of UXS activity leads to a defective extracellular matrix, resulting in strong interference with cell signaling pathways. We present comprehensive structural and mechanistic characterization of the human form of UXS. The 1.26-Å crystal structure of the enzyme bound with NAD(+) and UDP reveals a homodimeric short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR), belonging to the NDP-sugar epimerases/dehydratases subclass. We show that enzymatic reaction proceeds in three chemical steps via UDP-4-keto-D-glucuronic acid and UDP-4-keto-pentose intermediates. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the D-glucuronyl ring accommodated by UXS features a marked (4)C(1) chair to B(O,3) boat distortion that facilitates catalysis in two different ways. It promotes oxidation at C(4) (step 1) by aligning the enzymatic base Tyr(147) with the reactive substrate hydroxyl and it brings the carboxylate group at C(5) into an almost fully axial position, ideal for decarboxylation of UDP-4-keto-D-glucuronic acid in the second chemical step. The protonated side chain of Tyr(147) stabilizes the enolate of decarboxylated C(4) keto species ((2)H(1) half-chair) that is then protonated from the Si face at C(5), involving water coordinated by Glu(120). Arg(277), which is positioned by a salt-link interaction with Glu(120), closes up the catalytic site and prevents release of the UDP-4-keto-pentose and NADH intermediates. Hydrogenation of the C(4) keto group by NADH, assisted by Tyr(147) as catalytic proton donor, yields UDP-xylose adopting the relaxed (4)C(1) chair conformation (step 3)."

Functional studies, extensive mutagenesis, and homology modeling indicate the following mechanism. A transporter conformation with a large outward-open cleft binds extracellular substrate, passes a state in which the substrate is occluded, turns to a conformation with an inward-open cleft, releases substrate, and subsequently turns back to the outward-open state. In the rat organic cation transporter (rOct1), voltage- and ligand-dependent movements of fluorescence-labeled cysteines were measured by voltage clamp fluorometry. For fluorescence detection, cysteine residues were introduced in extracellular parts of cleft-forming transmembrane α-helices (TMHs) 5, 8, and 11. Following expression of the mutants in Xenopus laevis oocytes, cysteines were labeled with tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide, and voltage-dependent conformational changes were monitored by voltage clamp fluorometry. One cysteine was introduced in the central domain of TMH 11 replacing glycine 478. This domain contains two amino acids that are involved in substrate binding and two glycine residues (Gly-477 and Gly-478) allowing for helix bending. Cys-478 could be modified with the transported substrate analog [2-(trimethylammonium)-ethyl]methanethiosulfonate but was inaccessible to tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide. Voltage-dependent movements at the indicator positions of TMHs 5, 8, and 11 were altered by substrate applications indicating large conformational changes during transport. The G478C exchange decreased transporter turnover and blocked voltage-dependent movements of TMHs 5 and 11. [2-(Trimethylammonium)-ethyl]methanethiosulfonate modification of Cys-478 blocked substrate binding, transport activity, and movement of TMH 8. The data suggest that Gly-478 is located within a mechanistically important hinge domain of TMH 11 in which substrate binding induces transport-related structural changes."
https://openalex.org/W2089191378,"All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been widely investigated for treatments of many cancers including prostate cancer. HOXB13, silenced in androgen receptor-negative (AR−) prostate cancer cells, plays a role in AR− prostate cancer cell growth arrest. In this study we intended to elucidate the mechanisms that are involved in the proliferation inhibition of AR− prostate cancer cells triggered by ATRA. We discovered that ATRA was able to induce the growth arrest and to increase HOXB13 expression in AR− prostate cancer cells. Both EZH2 and DNMT3b participated in the repression of HOXB13 expression through an epigenetic mechanism involving DNA and histone methylation modifications. Specifically, EZH2 recruited DNMT3b to HOXB13 promoter to form a repression complex. Moreover, ATRA could upregulate HOXB13 through decreasing EZH2 and DNMT3b expressions and reducing their interactions with the HOXB13 promoter. Concurrently, the methylation level of the HOXB13 promoter was reduced upon the treatment of ATRA. Results from this study implicated a novel effect of ATRA in inhibition of the growth of AR− resistant human prostate cancer cells through alteration of HOXB13 expression as a result of epigenetic modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2059941629,"Staphylococcus aureus biofilms are associated with chronic skin infections and are orders of magnitude more resistant to antimicrobials and host responses. S. aureus contains conserved nonribosomal peptide synthetases that produce the cyclic dipeptides tyrvalin and phevalin (aureusimine A and B, respectively). The biological function of these compounds has been speculated to be involved in virulence factor gene expression in S. aureus, protease inhibition in eukaryotic cells, and interspecies bacterial communication. However, the exact biological role of these compounds is unknown. Here, we report that S. aureus biofilms produce greater amounts of phevalin than their planktonic counterparts. Phevalin had no obvious impact on the extracellular metabolome of S. aureus as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. When administered to human keratinocytes, phevalin had a modest effect on gene expression. However, conditioned medium from S. aureus spiked with phevalin amplified differences in keratinocyte gene expression compared to conditioned medium alone. Phevalin may be exploited as potential biomarker and/or therapeutic target for chronic, S. aureus biofilm-based infections."
https://openalex.org/W2138481297,"The thio-modification of tRNA that occurs in virtually all organisms affects the accuracy and efficiency of protein translation and is therefore biologically important. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for this tRNA modification in plants is largely unclear. We demonstrate here that Arabidopsis sulfurtransferase Cnx5, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme-like (UBA) protein involved in molybdopterin (MPT) biosynthesis, is strictly required for the thio-modification of cytosolic tRNAs in vivo. A previously uncharacterized ubiquitin-like (Ubl) protein Urm11 is also essential for tRNA thio-modification in Arabidopsis. When expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cnx5 and Urm11 can substitute for the corresponding yeast orthologs ScUba4 and ScUrm1, respectively, in the thio-modification of yeast cytosolic tRNAs. However, another Ubl protein, Cnx7 of Arabidopsis, which is involved in MPT biosynthesis in conjunction with Cnx5, cannot replace yeast ScUrm1. Interestingly, the expression of a mutant form of Cnx7 in which the carboxyl-terminal six amino acids are substituted by those of Urm11 can significantly restore the thio-modification of tRNAs in the yeast urm1Δ mutant. These findings suggest that in Arabidopsis the common UBA protein Cnx5 collaborates with two functionally differentiated Ubl proteins, Urm11 and Cnx7, in the thio-modification of tRNA and MPT biosynthesis, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that although most eukaryotes contained a Cnx5-Urm11 ortholog pair and the tRNA thio-modification some fungi, including S. cerevisiae, had lost the Cnx7 ortholog and the ability to synthesize the molybdenum cofactor.

https://openalex.org/W2041800002,"Sleep after learning has been shown to foster the consolidation of new memories. However, fundamental questions on the best timing of learning before night-time sleep persist. We tested the hypothesis that learning directly prior to night-time sleep compared to 7.5 hrs prior to night-time sleep provides better conditions for the consolidation of declarative and procedural memories. Fifty healthy female adolescents (aged 16-17 years) were trained on a declarative word-pair and a procedural finger-tapping task at 3 pm (afternoon group, n = 25) or at 9 pm (evening group, n = 25), followed by a sleep laboratory night. Retrieval was assessed 24 hours and 7 days after initial training. Subjects trained in the afternoon showed a significantly elevated retention rate of word-pairs compared to subjects trained in the evening after 24 hours, but not after 7 days. In contrast, off-line gains in finger-tapping performance were significantly higher in subjects trained in the evening compared to those trained in the afternoon after both retention intervals. The observed enhanced consolidation of procedural memories after training in the evening fits to current models of sleep-related memory consolidation. In contrast, the higher retention of declarative memories after encoding in the afternoon is surprising, appeared to be less robust and needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1977635800,"Levan is β-2,6-linked polymeric fructose and serves as reserve carbohydrate in some plants and microorganisms. Mobilization of fructose is usually mediated by enzymes such as glycoside hydrolase (GH), typically releasing a monosaccharide as a product. The enzyme levan fructotransferase (LFTase) of the GH32 family catalyzes an intramolecular fructosyl transfer reaction and results in production of cyclic difructose dianhydride, thus exhibiting a novel substrate specificity. The mechanism by which LFTase carries out these functions via the structural fold conserved in the GH32 family is unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of LFTase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens in apo form, as well as in complexes with sucrose and levanbiose, a difructosacchride with a β-2,6-glycosidic linkage. Despite the similarity of its two-domain structure to members of the GH32 family, LFTase contains an active site that accommodates a difructosaccharide using the −1 and −2 subsites. This feature is unique among GH32 proteins and is facilitated by small side chain residues in the loop region of a catalytic β-propeller N-domain, which is conserved in the LFTase family. An additional oligosaccharide-binding site was also characterized in the β-sandwich C-domain, supporting its role in carbohydrate recognition. Together with functional analysis, our data provide a molecular basis for the catalytic mechanism of LFTase and suggest functional variations from other GH32 family proteins, notwithstanding the conserved structural elements.

Fructans are polymeric carbohydrates of fructose linked via O-glycosidic bonds, with a terminal sucrose. The β-2,1-linked inulin and β-2,6-linked levan are the two major types of fructans identified to date, and they represent one of the primary carbohydrate storage molecules in some plants, bacteria, and fungi (1Vijn I. Smeekens S. Fructan. More than a reserve carbohydrate?.Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In addition to their role as an energy reserve, plant fructans also function in cold and drought tolerance (1Vijn I. Smeekens S. Fructan.

Their biosynthetic pathways in bacteria are relatively well established; in these pathways, a single multifunctional enzyme of levansucrase (4Meng G. Fütterer K.

Biol. 2011; 412: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) is responsible for the synthesis of levan and inulin, respectively, with sucrose as a substrate. However, those pathways have not yet been conclusive in plants (7Lammens W. Le Roy K. Schroeven L. Van Laere A. Rabijns A. Van den Ende W. Structural insights into glycoside hydrolase family 32 and 68 enzymes. Functional implications.J. Exp. Bot. 2009; 60: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Once the fructosyl moiety is reserved in fructans, its mobilization is achieved by various hydrolytic enzymes (7Lammens W. Le Roy K. Schroeven L. Van Laere A. Rabijns A. Van den Ende W.

For example, plant fructan exohydrolases successively remove one terminal fructose unit from inulin and levan through an exo-type reaction, although in bacteria levanase and inulinase perform both endo- and exo-type reactions toward these fructans. In contrast, an unusual type of fructan-utilizing enzyme catalyzes an intramolecular fructosyl transfer reaction, in which a terminal fructose and its adjacent moiety form an anhydride linkage, in addition to the existing glycosidic bond (see Fig. 1A) (8Song K.

Tomita F. Difructose anhydrides. Their mass-production and physiological functions.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1321-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For example, inulin fructotransferase (IFTase; EC 4.2.2.17 or 18) depolymerizes β-2,1′-linked inulin into a difructosaccharide in an exolytic manner to form DFA-I and DFA-III (11Jung W.S. Hong C.K.

Because DFAs produced by these enzymes have various beneficial effects on human health and as such are used as dietary supplements and low calorie sweeteners, DFA production has gained the attention of food microbiologists and biotechnologists (13Ritsema T.

Although the fructan-utilizing enzymes exhibit diverse substrate specificities and catalytic properties, these enzymes—including LFTase—are either O-glycoside hydrolase (GH) 32 or GH68 family enzymes, based on sequence similarity classifications (CAZy) (15Henrissat B. Davies G. Structural and sequence-based classification of glycoside hydrolases.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). More specifically, most of these enzymes are members of the GH32 family; however, bacterial levansucrase and inulosucrase are in the GH68 family. Despite their limited sequence homology, these two families exhibit high similarities in their three-dimensional structures and belong to the GH-J clan by a structure-based classification (16Naumoff D.G. Hierarchical classification of glycoside hydrolases.Biochemistry. 2011; 76: 622-635PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, a five-bladed β-propeller fold that acts as a catalytic domain is common to the GH-J clan, whereas an additional β-sandwich domain has been characterized in the GH32 family C-terminal region. The only exception to these general features is with IFTase, which is a member of the GH91 family and adopts a homotrimeric β-helical fold with its active site located in the intersubunit interface (11Jung W.S. Hong C.K. Lee S. Kim C.S. Kim S.J. Kim S.I Rhee S. Structural and functional insights into intramolecular fructosyl transfer by inulin fructotransferase.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8414-8423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Notably, the proposed catalytic residues and their mechanistic features account for characteristics of IFTase that differ from those of the GH32 and GH68 families. Unlike IFTase, the DFA-IV-producing LFTase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens K-2032 (AuLFTase) is a member of the GH32 family (12Kim C.H. Jang E.K. Kim S.H. Jang K.H. Kang S.A. Song K.B. Kwon O.S. Rhee S.K. Molecular cloning of levan fructotransferase gene from Arthrobacter ureafaciens K2032 and its expression in Escherichia coli for the production of difructose dianhydride IV.Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 2005; 40: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, how the unusual functional features of AuLFTase can be accommodated within the structural fold conserved in the GH-J clan remains to be resolved. We determined the crystal structure of AuLFTase and conducted a functional analysis to understand its structural and functional features. The structure of AuLFTase was determined in apo form at a resolution of 2.57 Å, as well as in two different binary complexes, one with sucrose at a resolution of 2.2 Å and the other at a resolution of 2.3 Å with levanbiose (O-β-d-fructofuranosyl-(2,6)β-d-fructofuranoside), a difructosaccharide with a β-2,6-glycosidic bond (supplemental Fig. S2). Our analyses provide the molecular basis for substrate specificity and the exolytic cleavage of levan, as well as structural similarities to and differences from members of the GH32 family. These results serve as a framework for understanding DFA-IV production by other LFTases. The gene for AuLFTase (12Kim C.H. Jang E.K. Kim S.H. Jang K.H. Kang S.A. Song K.B. Kwon O.S. Rhee S.K. Molecular cloning of levan fructotransferase gene from Arthrobacter ureafaciens K2032 and its expression in Escherichia coli for the production of difructose dianhydride IV.Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 2005; 40: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number AF181254) was amplified by PCR with sequence-specific primers (supplemental Table S1). The resulting PCR product contained residues Ala-41 to Ile-521 by excluding the N-terminal 40 residues as a signal peptide, Met-1 to Ala-33 (supplemental Fig. S1), and was subcloned into the pET28b expression vector (Merck) with the C-terminal noncleavable His tag. Seleno-l-methionine-substituted, C-terminal His-tagged AuLFTase (residues Ala-41 to Ile-521) was expressed in Escherichia coli B834 (DE3) methionine auxotroph cells (Merck) for structural studies. In particular, we found that methylation of AuLFTase is essential for crystallization. Therefore, a methylation step was included in the purification, according to a protocol published previously (17Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M.

Cells were grown at 37 °C in minimal medium supplemented with seleno-l-methionine to an A600 of 0.7 and then induced for 16 h at 20 °C by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested and sonicated in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl). The enzyme was purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography with buffer A plus 500 mm imidazole. After the purified AuLFTase was dialyzed against buffer A, the methylation reaction using the dimethylamine-borane complex, and formaldehyde was performed overnight at 4 °C with 1–2 mg/ml of AuLFTase. After the soluble fraction from the reaction mixture had been obtained by centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) was carried out with buffer A to remove any possible aggregated form of the protein. Elution fractions for AuLFTaseMET (hereafter, a superscript of MET denotes the methylated enzyme) were pooled, resulting in a yield of 15 mg/ml, based on its molar extinction coefficient of 151,260 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm. AuLFTaseMET was catalytically competent (supplemental Fig. S3A), and four of the five lysine residues were estimated to be methylated at the ϵ-amino group of lysine, based on mass spectroscopy-time of flight analysis. For structural analysis of AuLFTaseMET in complex with either sucrose or levanbiose, we used a mutant AuLFTase(D54N)MET enzyme, in which the catalytic nucleophile Asp-54, common to members of the GH32 family (supplemental Fig. S1), was mutated into asparagine to exclude any possible involvement of Asp-54 in catalysis of the ligand used in this experiment. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange (Agilent Technologies), with mutagenic primers (supplemental Table S1), and the resulting plasmid that encodes the AuLFTase(D54N) enzyme was then transformed into the BL21(DE3) codon plus-RIL strain (Agilent Technologies) and expressed in Luria Bertani medium. The purification steps for AuLFTase(D54N)MET were identical to the procedure described above, with the exception of addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol. We also confirmed that mutant AuLFTase(D54N) was catalytically inactive (supplemental Fig. S3A). During protein purification, we noticed that both the native and methylated enzyme were monomeric, based on their size exclusion chromatography elution profiles. The apo form of seleno-l-methionine-substituted AuLFTaseMET was crystallized at 22 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method in a crystallization buffer of 0.1 m Bis-Tris (pH 5.5), 1% (w/v) PEG 3350, 1 m ammonium sulfate, and 3% 2-propanol. Unlike the WT enzyme, crystals for the apo form of the AuLFTase(D54N)MET mutant enzyme were produced at 22 °C in different crystallization buffers using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method; the crystallization buffer consisted of 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5) and 1 m lithium sulfate. Formation of the AuLFTase(D54N)MET-ligand complex, either with sucrose or levanbiose, was achieved by a soaking procedure. Sucrose is not a substrate of AuLFTase (supplemental Fig. S3A), but the enzyme structure in a complex with sucrose reveals crucial structural features of AuLFTase substrate binding. For the AuLFTase(D54N)MET-sucrose complex, a pregrown crystal of AuLFTase(D54N)MET was soaked for 60 min in a solution of 1 m sucrose in 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5), 1 m lithium sulfate, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. The AuLFTase(D54N)MET-levanbiose complex was obtained by soaking a crystal for 60 min in 30% of the levanbiose reaction product (supplemental “Methods”) in 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5), 1 m lithium sulfate, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. In both experiments, glycerol was included as a cryoprotectant. We also determined the crystal structure of AuLFTaseMET in complex with the DFA-IV product. Specifically, DFA-IV was produced by reacting 3% (w/v) levan (average molecular weight of 50,000 from Realbiotech, Chungnam, Korea) in buffer A with 0.28 mm AuLFTaseMET. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 3 h, and the entire reaction mixture, including AuLFTaseMET, was crystallized under conditions identical to those for AuLFTase(D54N)MET. Subsequent structural analyses, as described below, indicated that DFA-IV is bound to the C-terminal domain of AuLFTaseMET, not to the catalytic domain (supplemental Fig. S3B). Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data using a crystal of the apo form of seleno-l-methionine-substituted AuLFTaseMET were collected at a resolution of 2.57 Å on Beamline 4A and 6C at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (Pohang, Korea). Subsequently, single-wavelength diffraction data were collected on Beamline 17A at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan), for the AuLFTase(D54N)MET-sucrose complex at a resolution of 2.2 Å and the AuLFTase(D54N)MET-levanbiose complex at a resolution of 2.3 Å. We collected all data at 100 K and processed them using the program HKL2000 (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

All of the crystals belonged to the space group of P212121, with four monomers per asymmetric unit (supplemental Table S2). The structure of AuLFTaseMET in apo form was determined using the programs SOLVE and RESOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Automated MAD and MIR structure solution.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Of 24 possible selenium atoms, 20 sites were identified and used to calculate the initial phases. The figure of merit was 0.71 by density modification with RESOLVE. After several iterative cycles of manual inspection and refinement, the model was built including Ala-41 to Gln-519 for all four monomers. The refined apo form model was then used as an initial structure to solve the structures of the binary complexes. The CNS program was used to perform a rigid body refinement followed by simulated annealing for the AuLFTase(D54N)MET-sucrose complex. The resulting electron density map showed one molecule of sucrose bound in the pocket of a β-propeller fold of monomers A and B, whereas the corresponding density was highly disordered in the other two monomers. Unexpectedly, we also found one molecule of sucrose bound in the C-terminal β-sandwich domain of all four monomers (supplemental Fig. S4A). An almost identical refinement strategy was used for the structural determination of the AuLFTase(D54N)MET-levanbiose complex using the PHENIX program (24Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Oeffner R. Read R.J. Richardson D.C. Richardson J.S. Terwilliger T.C. Zwart P.H. PHENIX. A comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16408) Google Scholar). Analogous to the AuLFTase(D54N)MET-sucrose complex, one molecule of levanbiose was clearly identified in the pocket of the β-propeller fold in monomer C, as well as in the C-terminal β-sandwich domain of monomers A, C, and D (supplemental Fig. S4B). Furthermore, continuous electron density for levan was observed at the C-terminal β-sandwich domain of monomer B, but the ordered density was for levantriose (supplemental Fig. S4C). Interestingly, we also characterized the binding of levanbiose on the surface of the β-propeller fold in the AuLFTase(D54N)MET-levanbiose complex for all four monomers. However, this binding seems to be nonspecific and unrelated with enzyme function, and details of those interactions are not described in this study. At the final refinement stage, water molecules, whose refined temperature factors are less than 50 Å2, were assigned based on the possible hydrogen bonding to the enzyme or a nearby water molecule. The final values for Rwork and Rfree were 21.2 and 25.6% for the apo form of AuLFTaseMET, 19.1 and 21.8% for the AuLFTase(D54N)MET-sucrose complex, and 21.5 and 25.1% for the AuLFTase(D54N)MET-levanbiose complex. Details of the refinement are described in supplemental Table S2. Structural comparisons and analyses were carried out using the CCP4 suite program (25Winn M.D. Ballard C.C. Cowtan K.D. Dodson E.J.

Overview of the CCP4 suite and current developments.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (9193) Google Scholar), and the figures were prepared using PyMOL (Molecular Graphics System, Palo Alto, CA). Various mutant enzymes were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange kit (Agilent Technologies), with mutagenic primers (supplemental Table S1). All enzymes used for the functional analysis were purified without methylation; their expressions, as well as the WT enzyme, were carried out in Luria Bertani medium, and the C-terminal His-tagged proteins were purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The purified enzymes were dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) and diluted to 0.2 mg/ml for the functional analysis. Enzyme assays were performed according to a method published previously (26Moon K.O. Choi K.H. Kang H.Y. Oh J.I. Jang S.B. Park C.S. Lee J.H. Cha J. Probing the critical residues for intramolecular fructosyl transfer reaction of a levan fructotransferase.J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 18: 1064-1069PubMed Google Scholar, 27Song E.K. Kim H. Sung H.K. Cha J. Cloning and characterization of a levanbiohydrolase from Microbacterium laevaniformans ATCC 15953.Gene. 2002; 291: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 μl of enzyme was incubated for 24 h at 40 °C with 600 μl of 1% (w/v) levan (Sigma), and the reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min. After centrifugation, the reaction product was analyzed by TLC and HPLC (supplemental “Methods”). AuLFTase is a monomeric protein in solution as characterized using size exclusion chromatography. Consistent with this observation, we could not identify any possible oligomeric conformations of AuLFTaseMET, either by noncrystallographic or crystallographic symmetry, even with four monomers in an asymmetric unit of the P212121 space group. Those four monomers in the asymmetric unit are structurally identical within a root mean square deviation of 0.19–0.48 Å for 479 Cα atoms between Ala-41 and Gln-519. We used Monomer B to describe the overall structure of AuLFTase. The AuLFTaseMET structure consists of the N-domain (Ala-41 to Val-364) and C-domain (Val-371 to Gln-519) (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). Specifically, the N-domain has 18 β-strands (β1 to β18) and three short α-helices arranged in a five-bladed β-propeller fold (Blades I–V) (Fig. 1B), whereas a β-sandwich fold of 14 β-strands (β19 to β32) is characterized in the C-domain, with the 310-helix as a linker between the two domains. This overall architecture is common to members of the GH32 family, in which the β-propeller N-domain functions as the catalytic domain (7Lammens W. Le Roy K. Schroeven L. Van Laere A. Rabijns A. Van den Ende W. Structural insights into glycoside hydrolase family 32 and 68 enzymes. Functional implications.J. Exp. Bot. 2009; 60: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The proposed catalytic residues of AuLFTase conserved in the GH32 and GH68 family also form a cluster for a “catalytic triad” at the center of the N-domain (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1), including Asp-54 nucleophile in Blade I, Glu-236 acid/base catalyst in Blade IV, and Asp-186 intermediate-stabilizing residue in Blade III. There are two layers of antiparallel β-sheets in the C-domain, in which the top layer of the β-sheet is composed of β21, β30, β23, β24, β25, and β26 in a spatial order and the other β-sheet consists of β19, β31, β32, β22, β27, β28, and β29. These two β-sheets are packed into a parallel orientation to form the β-sandwich fold of the C-domain, generating a concave surface on the top β-sheet. Notably, the concave surface of the C-domain is on the same face as the entrance to the center of the β-propeller N-domain (Fig. 1B). An AuLFTase(D54N)MET mutant enzyme, which is catalytically inactive (supplemental Fig. S3A), was used for the structural analysis of the complex with sucrose. Of the four monomers in the asymmetric unit, two exhibited an ordered electron density for sucrose bound in the β-propeller N-domain pocket (Fig. 2A), as well as on the surface of the β-sandwich C-domain (supplemental Fig. S4A). The pocket identified in the N-domain begins at the center of the β-propeller fold and extends to the edge of the enzyme enclosed by Blades I and II, resulting in an elongated shape (Fig. 2, B and C). Specifically, the innermost floor of the pocket is laid with residues in β1 (Trp-51, Cys-53, and Asn-54) and β3 (Leu-70 and Ser-72) strands in Blade I, whereas the side walls along the long axis of the pocket consist of two loops; that on the wall includes a loop containing Pro-106 and Trp-108 between Blades I and II, and the other involves a loop with Trp-322 between β16 and β17 in Blade V. One end of the pocket is occluded at the center of the domain by residues from Blades III, IV, and V, including residues Glu-236 and Asp-186, as well as Arg-185 and Tyr-298. The other end of the pocket near the Blade I region is also sealed by a loop between β3 and β4 in Blade I; specifically, residues such as Asn-76, Gly-77, Pro-78, and Gly-79 constitute the end wall of the pocket. However, the arrangement of these residues left the top of the pocket wide open to the surface (Fig. 2B). In the pocket, sucrose is oriented such that the fructosyl moiety faces the bottom of the pocket as a stacked orientation, and the pyranosyl ring of glucose points upward to the surface of the N-domain, with its conformation almost perpendicular to the fructose furanosyl ring (Fig. 2, B and C). There are extensive hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with sucrose. In particular, the catalytic triad clustered at the center of the N-domain remains in the vicinity of the sucrose glycosidic bond; the side chain of Asn-54 in the AuLFTase(D54N)MET mutant enzyme, which replaced the WT nucleophile Asp-54, is located ∼3.6 Å below the anomeric carbon (C2′) of fructose, and the carboxyl group of an acid/base catalyst Glu-236 is at 3.1 Å from an oxygen atom of the glycosidic bond. The Asp-186 intermediate-stabilizing residue is located within 2.8 Å from the hydroxyl group of f"

Calorimetric analysis shows that binding can occur first at either nucleotide site, but that initial interaction at the ATP/ADP site was favored and enhanced affinity for APS in the second site by 50-fold. The thermodynamics of the two possible binding models (i.e. ATP first versus APS first) differs and implies that active site structural changes guide the order of nucleotide addition. The ligand binding analysis also supports an earlier suggestion of intermolecular interactions in the dimeric APSK structure. Crystallographic, site-directed mutagenesis, and energetic analyses of oxyanion recognition by the P-loop in the ATP/ADP binding site and the role of Asp136, which bridges the ATP/ADP and APS/PAPS binding sites, suggest how the ordered nucleotide binding sequence and structural changes are dynamically coordinated for catalysis.

Since blocking immune complex formation can attenuate disease manifestations, the effects of nucleic acid binding polymers (NABPs) on anti-DNA binding in vitro were investigated. The compounds tested included polyamidoamine dendrimer, 1,4-diaminobutane core, generation 3.0 (PAMAM-G3), hexadimethrine bromide, and a β-cylodextrin-containing polycation. As shown with plasma from patients with SLE, NABPs can inhibit anti-DNA antibody binding in ELISA assays. The inhibition was specific since the NABPs did not affect binding to tetanus toxoid or the Sm protein, another lupus autoantigen. Furthermore, the polymers could displace antibody from preformed complexes. Together, these results indicate that NABPs can inhibit the formation of immune complexes and may represent a new approach to treatment."

However, the underlying mechanism leading to this signaling cascade remains unclear. The present study showed that using Rck-coated beads or Rck-overexpressing Escherichia coli, Rck-mediated actin polymerization and invasion were blocked by PP2, a Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In addition, phosphorylation of Src family kinases significantly increased after stimulation with Rck. The specific contribution of c-Src, one member of the Src family kinases, was demonstrated using c-Src-deficient fibroblasts or c-Src siRNA transfected epithelial cells. We also observed that Rck-mediated internalization led to the formation of a complex between c-Src and at least one tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. Furthermore, our results revealed that the c-Src signal molecule was upstream of PI 3-kinase during the Rck-mediated signaling pathway as Rck-mediated PI 3-kinase activation was blocked by PP2, and PI 3-kinase inhibitor had no effect on the Src phosphorylation. These results demonstrate the involvement of c-Src upstream of the PI 3-kinase in the Zipper entry process mediated by Rck."

Con I and II have acquired a novel protein fold via domain swapping and a new ligand-binding site by accelerated evolution, which enables recognition of some marine bacteria. In this study, we identified a new congerin isotype, congerin P (Con-P), from the peritoneal cells of conger eel. Although Con-P displayed obvious homology with galectins, we observed substitution of 7 out of 8 amino acid residues in the carbohydrate recognition domain that are conserved in all other known galectins. To understand the structure-function relationships of this unique galectin, recombinant Con-P was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli by using a Con II-tagged fusion protein system and subsequently characterized. In the presence of d-mannose, Con-P displayed 30-fold greater hemagglutinating activity than Con I; however, no activity was observed without mannose, indicating that d-mannoside can act as a modulator of Con-P. Frontal affinity chromatography analysis showed that activated Con-P, allosterically induced by mannose, displayed affinity for oligomannose-type sugars as well as N-acetyllactosamine-type β-galactosides.

https://openalex.org/W2028123684,"Background Incidence of urinary tract infections is elevated in patients with diabetes mellitus. Those patients show increased levels of the saturated free fatty acid palmitate. As recently shown metabolic alterations induced by palmitate include production and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukine-6 (IL-6) in cultured human bladder smooth muscle cells (hBSMC). Here we studied the influence of palmitate on vital cell properties, for example, regulation of cell proliferation, mitochondrial enzyme activity and antioxidant capacity in hBSMC, and analyzed the involvement of major cytokine signaling pathways. Methodology/Principal Findings HBSMC cultures were set up from bladder tissue of patients undergoing cystectomy and stimulated with palmitate. We analyzed cell proliferation, mitochondrial enzyme activity, and antioxidant capacity by ELISA and confocal immunofluorescence. In signal transduction inhibition experiments we evaluated the involvement of NF-κB, JAK/STAT, MEK1, PI3K, and JNK in major cytokine signaling pathway regulation. We found: (i) palmitate decreased cell proliferation, increased mitochondrial enzyme activity and antioxidant capacity; (ii) direct inhibition of cytokine receptor by AG490 even more strongly suppressed cell proliferation in palmitate-stimulated cells, while counteracting palmitate-induced increase of antioxidant capacity; (iii) in contrast knockdown of the STAT3 inhibitor SOCS3 increased cell proliferation and antioxidant capacity; (iv) further downstream JAK/STAT3 signaling cascade the inhibition of PI3K or JNK enhanced palmitate induced suppression of cell proliferation; (v) increase of mitochondrial enzyme activity by palmitate was enhanced by inhibition of PI3K but counteracted by inhibition of MEK1. Conclusions/Significance Saturated free fatty acids (e.g., palmitate) cause massive alterations in vital cell functions of cultured hBSMC involving distinct major cytokine signaling pathways. Thereby, certain cytokines might counteract the palmitate-induced downregulation of cell proliferation and vitality. This could be an important link to clinical findings of increased risk of metabolic related bladder diseases such as overactive bladder (OAB) and bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC)."
https://openalex.org/W2031097644,"Maf1 is a conserved regulator of RNA polymerase (pol) III transcription and is required for transcriptional repression under diverse stress conditions. In yeast, Maf1 function is negatively regulated at seven phosphosites by the overlapping action of protein kinase A (PKA) and the TORC1-regulated kinase Sch9. Under stress conditions, Maf1 is dephosphorylated at these sites leading to its nuclear accumulation, increased association with pol III genes and direct physical interactions with the polymerase which ultimately inhibit transcription. These changes are reversed upon return to optimal growth conditions. Transcription in this system is also regulated by protein kinase CK2. CK2 stimulates pol III transcription in yeast and human cells via phosphorylation of the initiation factor TFIIIB. Recently it was proposed that CK2 phosphorylation of Maf1 is required for reactivation of pol III transcription following growth on glycerol. We have examined this hypothesis using two Maf1 mutants (Maf1-id S388A and Maf1-ck2(0)) which lack all of the CK2 phosphosites implicated in the response. Both mutant proteins are phosphoregulated, function normally during repression and transcription is fully restored to the wild-type level upon transfer from glycerol to glucose. Additionally, phos-tag gel analysis of Maf1 7SA, a functional mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by PKA/Sch9, did not reveal any evidence for differential phosphorylation of Maf1 during carbon source switching. Together, these data do not support the proposed requirement for CK2 phosphorylation of Maf1 during derepression of pol III transcription."

We used standardized data collected during the epidemic and a model to extract data for untraced contacts based on the daily number of infectious farms within a given distance of a susceptible farm. With these data, we used a maximum likelihood estimation approach to estimate the transmission probabilities by the individual contact types, both traced and untraced. The estimated conditional probabilities, conditional on the contact originating from an infectious farm, of virus transmission were: 0.000057 per infectious farm within 1 km per day, 0.000413 per infectious farm between 1 and 3 km per day, 0.0000895 per infectious farm between 3 and 10 km per day, 0.0011 per crisis organisation contact, 0.0414 per feed delivery contact, 0.308 per egg transport contact, 0.133 per other-professional contact and, 0.246 per rendering contact. We validate these outcomes against literature data on virus genetic sequences for outbreak farms. These estimates can be used to inform further studies on the role that improved biosecurity between contacts and/or contact frequency reduction can play in eliminating between-farm spread of the virus during future epidemics. The findings also highlight the need to; 1) understand the routes underlying the infections without traced contacts and, 2) to review whether the contact-tracing protocol is exhaustive in relation to all the farm's day-to-day activities and practices."

The genes encoding for proteins involved in the biosynthesis of the nucleoside moiety of nikkomycins are co-transcribed in the same operon, comprising the genes nikIJKLMNO. The gene product NikO was shown to belong to the family of enolpyruvyl transferases and to catalyze the transfer of an enolpyruvyl moiety from phosphoenolpyruvate to the 3'-hydroxyl group of UMP.

https://openalex.org/W2093887899,"The pathological form of prion protein (PrP(Sc)), as other amyloidogenic proteins, causes a marked increase of membrane permeability. PrP(Sc) extracted from infected Syrian hamster brains induces a considerable change in membrane ionic conductance, although the contribution of this interaction to the molecular mechanism of neurodegeneration process is still controversial. We previously showed that the human PrP fragment 90-231 (hPrP₉₀₋₂₃₁) increases ionic conductance across artificial lipid bilayer, in a calcium-dependent manner, producing an alteration similar to that observed for PrP(Sc). In the present study we demonstrate that hPrP₉₀₋₂₃₁, pre-incubated with 10 mM Ca⁺⁺ and then re-suspended in physiological external solution increases not only membrane conductance but neurotoxicity as well. Furthermore we show the existence of a direct link between these two effects as demonstrated by a highly statistically significant correlation in several experimental conditions. A similar correlation between increased membrane conductance and cell degeneration has been observed assaying hPrP₉₀₋₂₃₁ bearing pathogenic mutations (D202N and E200K). We also report that Ca⁺⁺ binding to hPrP₉₀₋₂₃₁ induces a conformational change based on an alteration of secondary structure characterized by loss of alpha-helix content causing hydrophobic amino acid exposure and proteinase K resistance. These features, either acquired after controlled thermal denaturation or induced by D202N and E200K mutations were previously identified as responsible for hPrP₉₀₋₂₃₁ cytotoxicity. Finally, by in silico structural analysis, we propose that Ca⁺⁺ binding to hPrP₉₀₋₂₃₁ modifies amino acid orientation, in the same way induced by E200K mutation, thus suggesting a pathway for the structural alterations responsible of PrP neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1967992674,"The co-evolutionary relationship between pathogen and host has led to a regulatory cycle between virulence factors needed for survival and antivirulence factors required for host transmission. This is exemplified in Salmonella spp. by the zirTS antivirulence genes: a secretion pathway comprised of the outer membrane transporter ZirT, and its secreted partner, ZirS. ZirTS act within the gastrointestinal tract to function as a virulence modulator and during Salmonella shedding in anticipation of a new host. Together, ZirT and ZirS decrease virulence by lowering bacterial colonization at systemic sites through an unknown mechanism. To understand this mechanism, we have probed the zirTS pathway both structurally and biochemically. The NMR derived structural ensemble of the C-terminal domain of ZirS reveals an immunoglobin superfamily fold (IgSF). Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture experiments show that the ZirS IgSF domain interacts with its transporter ZirT, and reveal a new protein interaction partner of the pathway, a protein encoded adjacent to zirTS that we have designated as ZirU. ZirU is secreted by ZirT and is also a predicted IgSF. Biochemical analysis delineates ZirT into an N-terminal porin-like β domain and C-terminal extracellular soluble IgSF domain, whereas biophysical characterization suggests that the transporter undergoes self-association in a concentration-dependent manner. We observe that ZirS and ZirU directly interact with each other and with the extracellular domains of ZirT.

Pathogenic microrganisms have the dual challenge of both adapting to survive within the environment of their host and mediating their transmission to new hosts. Such organisms employ a number of virulence genes, which are often encoded together on a localized genetic segment or pathogenicity island (1Coburn B. Sekirov I. Finlay B.B.

These factors are readily identifiable as their disruption reduces or abolishes the severity of the disease phenotype of the infecting species. Prominent examples include the type III secretion system, found in Gram-negative bacteria such as Salmonella and Yersinia (3Worrall L.J. Lameignere E. Strynadka N.C.

Contingent with virulence factors, pathogens also employ genes that encode for antivirulence function(s). Similar to virulence proteins, antivirulence proteins can be identified by their disruption, but instead result in a more severe disease or hypervirulence phenotype.

Although as a field antivirluence is relatively new, examples are readily appearing with the availability of pathogen genomes and bioinformatic techniques (8Foreman-Wykert A.K. Miller J.F. Hypervirulence and pathogen fitness.Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 105-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Antivirulence proteins have been characterized in Leishmania spp., protozoan parasites that cause skin lesions and eventual death (10Cunningham M.L. Titus R.G. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M.

Immun. 2001; 69: 6463-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In each case, the antivirulence proteins act to decrease population growth of the pathogen during specific points of infection, effectively increasing the levels of host survival required to allow for efficient transmission. In Salmonella spp., two characterized examples, sciS (12Parsons D.A. Heffron F. sciS, an icmF homolog in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, limits intracellular replication and decreases virulence.Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 4338-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and the zirTS pathway (13Gal-Mor O. Gibson D.L. Baluta D. Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. A novel secretion pathway of Salmonella enterica acts as an antivirulence modulator during salmonellosis.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000036Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), highlight the pathogenic importance of antivirulence. Upon ingestion of contaminated food or drinking water, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella typhimurium) localize to the intestinal mucosa and phagocytotic cells of their human hosts where they internalize and replicate by virtue of their type III secretion systems (3Worrall L.J. Lameignere E. Strynadka N.C. Structural overview of the bacterial injectisome.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2011; 14: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Kingsley R.A. Bäumler A.J. Pathogenicity islands and host adaptation of Salmonella serovars.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 264: 67-87PubMed Google Scholar). Here the bacteria cause a self-limiting gastroenteritis, with diarrheal symptoms resulting when newly replicated S. typhimurium induce shedding of the intestinal mucosal lining. This ultimately leads to the release of the pathogen into the environment for transmission to new hosts (16Grassl G.A. Finlay B.B. Pathogenesis of enteric Salmonella infections.Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 2008; 24: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The gene sciS has been shown to be intimately involved in these replication events, where it regulates Salmonella division within macrophages (12Parsons D.A. Heffron F. sciS, an icmF homolog in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, limits intracellular replication and decreases virulence.Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 4338-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The deletion of sciS results in an increase of bacterium in macrophages infected in vitro, and an 8-fold increase of lethality in mice infected intragastrically (12Parsons D.A. Heffron F. sciS, an icmF homolog in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, limits intracellular replication and decreases virulence.Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 4338-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Together this suggests that sciS attenuates virulence at the late stages of infection (12Parsons D.A. Heffron F. sciS, an icmF homolog in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, limits intracellular replication and decreases virulence.Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 4338-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The zirTS pathway also regulates virulence by attenuating population growth, but instead influences the early stages of infection (13Gal-Mor O. Gibson D.L. Baluta D. Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. A novel secretion pathway of Salmonella enterica acts as an antivirulence modulator during salmonellosis.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000036Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Deletion of zirTS genes results in a hypervirulence phenotype, with the median survival time of BALB/c mice dropping from 8.5 to 6 days, and wild-type Salmonella outcompeting deletion strains by 4-fold as observed by competitive index experiments (13Gal-Mor O. Gibson D.L. Baluta D. Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. A novel secretion pathway of Salmonella enterica acts as an antivirulence modulator during salmonellosis.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000036Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was found that zirTS is expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract rather than at systemic sites, and is highly expressed during bacterial shedding in fecal pellets at 8 weeks postinfection (13Gal-Mor O. Gibson D.L. Baluta D. Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. A novel secretion pathway of Salmonella enterica acts as an antivirulence modulator during salmonellosis.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000036Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the system was shown to be negatively regulated by OxyR, a transcription factor that controls the expression of genes in response to oxidative stress (17Storz G. Imlay J.A. Oxidative stress.Curr. Opin Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar), and also by the presence of zinc in the media. As Salmonella spp. are primarily transmitted by the ingestion of contaminated fecal matter, ZirTS is expressed in the anticipation of infection of a new host to regulate bacterial virulence upon colonization of the intestinal tract (13Gal-Mor O. Gibson D.L. Baluta D. Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. A novel secretion pathway of Salmonella enterica acts as an antivirulence modulator during salmonellosis.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000036Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The zirTS genes are located on a horizontally acquired genomic island that is conserved in pathogenic strains of Salmonella (13Gal-Mor O. Gibson D.L. Baluta D. Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. A novel secretion pathway of Salmonella enterica acts as an antivirulence modulator during salmonellosis.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000036Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18McClelland M.

Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2.Nature. 2001; 413: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). ZirS (zinc regulated secreted) is a 31-kDa protein of unknown function that is secreted by ZirT (zinc regulated transporter), a 72-kDa outer membrane protein (19Fairman J.W. Dautin N. Wojtowicz D. Liu W. Noinaj N. Barnard T.J. Udho E. Przytycka T.M. Cherezov V. Buchanan S.K.

Gibson D.L. Baluta D. Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. A novel secretion pathway of Salmonella enterica acts as an antivirulence modulator during salmonellosis.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000036Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). ZirS and ZirT are predicted to constitute a secretion system with aspects reminiscent of type V two-partner secretion systems (20Mazar J. Cotter P.A. New insight into the molecular mechanisms of two-partner secretion.Trends Microbiol. 2007; 15: 508-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, ZirS lacks the N-terminal two-partner secretion system domain typically necessary for targeting of the secreted component to the cognate transporter in other type V systems. Additionally, ZirS has sequence homology (24% identity) with a putative human zinc finger protein (NP_065798), and the open reading frame adjacent to ZirS (STM1667) is a predicted thiol peroxidase (13Gal-Mor O. Gibson D.L. Baluta D. Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. A novel secretion pathway of Salmonella enterica acts as an antivirulence modulator during salmonellosis.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000036Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In light of the negative regulation of the pathway by OxyR and zinc, these previous observations suggested a potential requirement for specific environmental regulatory cues for ZirTS function. To elucidate the molecular details governing the mechanism of action and regulation of the zirTS antivirulence pathway in Salmonella, we have undertaken a structural approach using NMR spectroscopy and computational modeling, coupled with biochemical and biophysical analysis. We characterize features of the known components of the zirTS pathway, ZirS and ZirT, and identify an additional protein component that directly interacts with the system, named herein as ZirU. Our results show that this secretion pathway is divergent from type V or other secretion, describes the zir antivirulence pathway as a multiprotein immunoglobulin adhesion system, and offers mechanistic insight into an antivirulence mechanism with a new role for the Ig-fold in bacterial pathogenesis. ZirS(136–276) was expressed as an N-terminal GST-tagged protein in pGEX6p1 (GE Healthcare) with restriction sites BamHI and Notl. Isotopically labeled samples were prepared with Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) grown at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/liter of 15NH4Cl and/or 3 g/liter of [13C6]glucose. At A600 >0.6 the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and the temperature lowered to 20 °C. After 20 h the cells were harvested, lysed by an Avestin homogenizer, and the lysate cleared by centrifugation. GST-ZirS was purified by passing the lysate over Q-Sepharose followed by glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C. The material was then digested overnight during dialysis with 3C protease and GST was removed using a Mono Q column. The ZirS material was concentrated and further purified by gel filtration using an SD75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.1, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 0.1 mm PMSF. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. ZirT(430–660) and ZirU(38–281) were purified as N-terminal GST-tagged constructs as per ZirS, but GST was not removed. The final buffer was 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. ZirT(1–660) was first cloned into pET52b (Novagen) with restriction sites Ncol and Sacl, then subcloned with the His tag and thrombin site into pBAD (Invitrogen). The vector was transformed into S. typhimurium lacking InvG and ZirT expression induced with 0.1% arabinose overnight at 20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, lysed with an Avestin homogenizer, and inclusion bodies were removed at 7,000 rpm for 20 min. Membranes were harvested by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. ZirT was extracted from membranes in the same buffer plus 1% N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide (LDAO) (Anatrace) and unextracted material was removed by ultracentrifugation. ZirT was purified by nickel-Sepharose in buffer with 0.2% N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide followed by gel filtration with Superose-6 in buffer plus 0.8% β-octyl glucoside (Anatrace). NMR spectra were recorded at 25 or 35 °C on Varian Unity 500 and cryoprobe-equipped Inova 600 MHz spectrometers. Final ZirS samples were composed of 0.5 mm protein in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.1, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 0.1 mm PMSF with the addition of 5% D2O. Signals from the 1H, 13C, and 15N nuclei of ZirS were detected and assigned by standard heteronuclear NMR experiments (21Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Heteronuclear multidimensional NMR experiments for the structure determination of proteins in solution employing pulsed field gradients.Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). 15N NOE relaxation data for ZirS were recorded using a 600 MHz spectrometer at 20 °C following established methods (22Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Backbone dynamics of a free and phosphopeptide-complexed Src homology 2 domain studied by 15N NMR relaxation.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). The NMR data were processed with NMRpipe (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. Nmrpipe, a multidimensional spectral processing system based on Unix Pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11533) Google Scholar) and analyzed with Sparky. 2T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, Sparky 3, University of San Francisco. The ZirS structural ensemble was calculated using CYANA, as summarized in supplemental Table S1 (24Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K.

A hybrid method for predicting protein backbone torsion angles from NMR chemical shifts.J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). Distance restraints were derived from a 100-ms mixing time simultaneous three-dimensional 13C/15N-edited NOESY-HSQC recorded with a 600 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C (27Zwahlen C. Legault P. Vincent S.J.F. Greenblatt J. Konrat R. Kay L.E. Methods for measurement of intermolecular NOEs by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. Application to a bacteriophage λ N-peptide/boxB RNA complex.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6711-6721Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and assigned automatically. Hydrogen bond restraints were based on diagnostic NOE patterns. The calculation consisted of 7 cycles of refinement with 100 iterations per cycle (25Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. Protein NMR structure determination with automated NOE assignment using the new software CANDID and the torsion angle dynamics algorithm DYANA.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). The 10 structures with the lowest calculated target function were chosen as a representative ensemble and refined in water using CNS (28Linge J.P. Williams M.A. Spronk C.A. Bonvin A.M. Nilges M.

Structural models for the ZirS N-terminal domain were calculated ab initio using the server Robetta (30Chivian D. Kim D.E. Malmström L. Bradley P. Robertson T. Murphy P. Strauss C.E. Bonneau R. Rohl C.A. Baker D. Automated prediction of CASP-5 structures using the Robetta server.Proteins. 2003; 53: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and manually with Rosetta (31Raman S.

Structure prediction for CASP8 with all-atom refinement using Rosetta.Proteins. 2009; 77: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) imposing a disulfide restraint. Residues 44–146 of ZirS were chosen to model due to secondary structure predictions with Jpred (32Cole C. Barber J.D. Barton G.J. The Jpred 3 secondary structure prediction server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W197-W201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). The forced disulfide constraint resulted in poorly packed folds consisting of isolated β-hairpins, whereas the Robetta server yielded folded domains that were analyzed by the Dali server (33Holm L. Rosenström P. Dali server. Conservation mapping in three-dimension.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar). ZirT(430–660) was modeled by the server Phyre2 (34Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Protein structure prediction on the Web. A case study using the Phyre server.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3553) Google Scholar) and with the program Modeller (35Eswar N. Eramian D. Webb B. Shen M.Y. Sali A. Protein structure modeling with MODELLER.Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 426: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Both constructed highly similar homology models with Invasin (Protein Data Bank code 1cwv) as the template. ZirT porin-like β domain constructs were overexpressed as C-terminal His-tagged constructs in the vector pET52b and purified as inclusion bodies. A concentration of 0.15 mg/ml of purified material was resuspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8, and 2% SDS at room temperature. Refolding was induced with the addition of 1.5 m 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) 3The abbreviations used are: MPD2-methyl-2,4-pentanediolIgSFimmunoglobulin superfamilySILACstable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell cultureICP-MSinductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometryBID and Bigbacterial immunoglobulin-like domainsHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherence. and monitored by SDS-PAGE. The secondary structure was measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy after concentration to 4.2 mg/ml (Jasco J-810). The CD data were de-convoluted using Dichroweb (36Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Protein secondary structure analyses from circular dichroism spectroscopy. Methods and reference databases.Biopolymers. 2008; 89: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar) and compared with Jpred (32Cole C. Barber J.D. Barton G.J.

ZirT was expressed as described above. After 1 h of induction at 37 °C, 1 ml of cells were harvested, washed 3 times in PBS to remove arabinose, and then resuspended in 500 μl. Thrombin was added at a total of 0, 8, or 80 μg and incubated for 1 or 2 h. The reaction was stopped with the addition of PBS and 1 mm PMSF and washed 3 times in the same buffer. The cells were resuspended in a final volume of 300 μl lysed by sonication and membranes were harvested. Samples were analyzed by Western blot with anti-His tag (Cedarlane) and developed by Immobilon Western Chemilumiescent HRP substrate (Millipore). Quantification was performed with Genesnap (SYNGENE) and graphed with GraphPad Prism. ZirT was concentrated to ∼3 mg/ml for gel filtration as described previously. Immediately after gel filtration, samples were assayed by dynamic light scattering (DynaPro Wyatt). Samples were microcentrifuged at maximum for 5 min before and measured at 0.4 and 1 mg/ml. Data were analyzed with a model consisting of an isotropic sphere and an aqueous solution plus 10% glycerol. Each concentration consisted of at least seven individual measurements contributing to the observed distribution. ZirU(1–281) and ZirS(1–276) were cloned into the vector pWSK29 with a C-terminal 2HA tag and transformed into Salmonella strain SL1344 or SL1344ΔzirT (13Gal-Mor O. Gibson D.L. Baluta D.

A novel secretion pathway of Salmonella enterica acts as an antivirulence modulator during salmonellosis.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000036Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For samples containing ZirT, ZirT was added in trans on the vector pBR322. Expression and secretion were monitored in the pellet and media by Western blot with anti-HA and anti-DnaK antibody and goat anti-mouse HRP secondary antibody for detection. All media fractions were sterile filtered before visualization. The presence of metals was tested by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with a NexION 3000 ICP mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and analyzed by the NexION software program. GST was used as a negative control and the zinc binding of New Delhi β-lactamase (kindly supplied by Dustin King) as a positive control. Purified GST-ZirS(136–276), GST-ZirU(38–281), and ZirT-Histag(430–660) were assayed. All proteins were diluted to 5 μm in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and then diluted 1/10 in an internal standard (10 μg/liter Sc45, 1% nitric acid, Inorganic Ventures). Each sample was measured three times and the average abundance was recorded. Salmonella and HeLa cells were grown in minimal media supplemented with isotopically labeled arginine (13C6) and lysine (D6) for “heavy” extracts and unlabeled amino acids for “light” extracts. For bait, 40 pmol of GST-ZirS IgSF was bound to glutathione beads and an equivalent molar ratio of GST alone as the control. The co-precipitation was performed according to standard methods (37Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Boulon S. Lam Y.W. Urcia R. Boisvert F"

https://openalex.org/W2155003515,"Background Approximately 2–4% of newborns with perinatal risk factors present with hearing loss. Our aim was to analyze the effect of hearing aid use on auditory function evaluated based on otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), auditory brain responses (ABRs) and auditory steady state responses (ASSRs) in infants with perinatal brain injury and profound hearing loss. Methodology/Principal Findings A prospective, longitudinal study of auditory function in infants with profound hearing loss. Right side hearing before and after hearing aid use was compared with left side hearing (not stimulated and used as control). All infants were subjected to OAE, ABR and ASSR evaluations before and after hearing aid use. The average ABR threshold decreased from 90.0 to 80.0 dB (p = 0.003) after six months of hearing aid use. In the left ear, which was used as a control, the ABR threshold decreased from 94.6 to 87.6 dB, which was not significant (p>0.05). In addition, the ASSR threshold in the 4000-Hz frequency decreased from 89 dB to 72 dB (p = 0.013) after six months of right ear hearing aid use; the other frequencies in the right ear and all frequencies in the left ear did not show significant differences in any of the measured parameters (p>0.05). OAEs were absent in the baseline test and showed no changes after hearing aid use in the right ear (p>0.05). Conclusions/Significance This study provides evidence that early hearing aid use decreases the hearing threshold in ABR and ASSR assessments with no functional modifications in the auditory receptor, as evaluated by OAEs."
