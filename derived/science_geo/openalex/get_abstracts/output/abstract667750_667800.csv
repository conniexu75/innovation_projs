https://openalex.org/W3128186941,"The first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in South Africa was identified on 5 March 2020, and by 26 March the country was in full lockdown (Oxford stringency index of 90)1. Despite the early response, by November 2020, over 785,000 people in South Africa were infected, which accounted for approximately 50% of all known African infections2. In this study, we analyzed 1,365 near whole genomes and report the identification of 16 new lineages of SARS-CoV-2 isolated between 6 March and 26 August 2020. Most of these lineages have unique mutations that have not been identified elsewhere. We also show that three lineages (B.1.1.54, B.1.1.56 and C.1) spread widely in South Africa during the first wave, comprising ~42% of all infections in the country at the time. The newly identified C lineage of SARS-CoV-2, C.1, which has 16 nucleotide mutations as compared with the original Wuhan sequence, including one amino acid change on the spike protein, D614G (ref. 3), was the most geographically widespread lineage in South Africa by the end of August 2020. An early South African-specific lineage, B.1.106, which was identified in April 2020 (ref. 4), became extinct after nosocomial outbreaks were controlled in KwaZulu-Natal Province. Our findings show that genomic surveillance can be implemented on a large scale in Africa to identify new lineages and inform measures to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Such genomic surveillance presented in this study has been shown to be crucial in the identification of the 501Y.V2 variant in South Africa in December 2020 (ref. 5). Interrogation of 1,365 near whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants isolated in South Africa during the first 6 months of the global pandemic reveals three major monophyletic lineages responsible for more than half of the infections in the country and underscores the value of integrating genomic surveillance methods to inform the national pandemic response."

Are they a result of students going back to school? To address this question, Monod et al. created a contact matrix for infection based on data collected in Europe and China and extended it to the United States. Early in the pandemic, before interventions were widely implemented, contacts concentrated among individuals of similar age were the highest among school-aged children, between children and their parents, and between middle-aged adults and the elderly. However, with the advent of nonpharmaceutical interventions, these contact patterns changed substantially. By mid-August 2020, although schools reopening facilitated transmission, the resurgence in the United States was largely driven by adults 20 to 49 years of age. Thus, working adults who need to support themselves and their families have fueled the resurging epidemics in the United States. Science , this issue p. eabe8372"

These diseases have myriad tissue-specific phenotypes, including dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), but how LMNA mutations result in tissue-restricted disease phenotypes remains unclear. We introduced LMNA mutations from individuals with DCM into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and found that hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, in contrast to hepatocytes or adipocytes, exhibit aberrant nuclear morphology and specific disruptions in peripheral chromatin. Disrupted regions were enriched for transcriptionally active genes and regions with lower LAMIN B1 contact frequency. The lamina-chromatin interactions disrupted in mutant cardiomyocytes were enriched for genes associated with non-myocyte lineages and correlated with higher expression of those genes. Myocardium from individuals with LMNA variants similarly showed aberrant expression of non-myocyte pathways. We propose that the lamina network safeguards cellular identity and that pathogenic LMNA variants disrupt peripheral chromatin with specific epigenetic and molecular characteristics, causing misexpression of genes normally expressed in other cell types.

Genome-lamina interactions provide a critical layer of gene regulation, but it remains unclear how these interactions affect cellular identity and disease. The nuclear lamina is a filamentous network of LAMIN A/C (LMNA), LAMIN B1 (LB1), and LAMIN B2 proteins on the inner nuclear surface. LMNA mutations result in gross nuclear abnormalities (Burke and Stewart, 2006Burke B. Stewart C.L. The laminopathies: the functional architecture of the nucleus and its contribution to disease.Annu.

LMNA mutants can alter normal nuclear rigidity (Houben et al., 2007Houben F. Ramaekers F.C. Snoeckx L.H. Broers J.L.

LMNA mutants are implicated in altered gene expression via aberrations in signal transduction or genome organization (Hutchison, 2002Hutchison C.J.

The nuclear lamina associates with large chromatin regions called LAMIN B1-associated domains (LADs) (Guelen et al., 2008Guelen L. Pagie L. Brasset E. Meuleman W. Faza M.B. Talhout W.

Genes in LADs are transcriptionally repressed, and some LADs are repositioned away from or to the lamina during differentiation in a cell-type-specific manner (Meister et al., 2010Meister P.

In worms, perinuclear chromatin sequestration contributes to lineage restriction by stabilizing cell fate commitment (Gonzalez-Sandoval et al., 2015Gonzalez-Sandoval A. Towbin B.D. Kalck V.

Pathogenic LMNA variants provide an attractive approach to unveil principles underlying the consequences of lamina-genome interactions. To this end, a C. elegans mutant lamin muscular dystrophy model displays muscle phenotypes and is rescued by restoring peripheral chromatin organization via loss of a peripheral chromatin tether (Harr et al., 2020Harr J.C.

Because a subset of LADs are cell type specific, mechanisms relevant to tissue-specific disease phenotypes are likely to be influenced by cellular context. This limits the interpretation of studies overexpressing variants or using immortalized cell lines (Mewborn et al., 2010Mewborn S.K. Puckelwartz M.J. Abuisneineh F. Fahrenbach J.P. Zhang Y.

Med. 2016; 8: 335ra58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Also, only a subset of LADs reposition away from the lamina during differentiation, and often only a portion of a LAD is repositioned (Briand and Collas, 2020Briand N. Collas P. Lamina-associated domains: peripheral matters and internal affairs.Genome Biol. 2020; 21: 85Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Genomic regions have varying probabilities of re-localization to or from the lamina (Kind et al., 2013Kind J. Pagie L. Ortabozkoyun H. Boyle S. de Vries S.S. Janssen H. Amendola M. Nolen L.D. Bickmore W.A. van Steensel B.

Thus, different types of peripheral chromatin may exist at the nuclear lamina with distinct mechanisms of establishment or maintenance, function, or genomic features. It is of great interest to understand whether peripheral chromatin is affected uniformly or stochastically by LMNA variants. Distinguishing LADs vulnerable to disruption from those that are resistant is vital to understand the mechanism of peripheral chromatin organization and the role of LADs in cellular identity and disease progression. We introduced a point mutation into one LMNA allele in a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line, resulting in a heterozygous T10I LAMIN A mutant, modeled after an individual with laminopathy. Mutant hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) demonstrated impaired physiology, dysmorphic nuclei, and disruption of a specific subset of peripheral chromatin regions characterized by greater gene density, higher expression, and lower LB1 enrichment. hiPSC-CMs carrying a pathogenic LMNA R541C mutation showed similar changes. These disruptions were specific to hiPSC-CMs; T10I and R541C hiPSC hepatocytes or hiPSC adipocytes did not demonstrate dysmorphic nuclei or LAD changes. Disrupted hiPSC-CM peripheral chromatin regions were enriched for genes and regulatory regions relevant to non-myocyte cell types, resulting in aberrant expression of genes ordinarily restricted to non-myocyte lineages. These data reveal that a subset of lamina-bound chromatin with definable molecular characteristics is disrupted in disease and may contribute to tissue-specific phenotypes observed in individuals with laminopathy. Genetic testing of a 33-year-old female with congestive heart failure requiring cardiac transplantation identified a heterozygous LMNA T10I (hereafter called T10I) mutation (Figure 1A). The woman’s family history was consistent with familial DCM; her father had heart failure requiring cardiac transplantation, and several relatives suffered from heart failure or sudden cardiac death. Explanted myocardium from the proband T10I individual revealed CMs with significantly larger and dysmorphic nuclei compared with myocardium from non-failing hearts or individuals with idiopathic DCM (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1A). We introduced the T10I mutation via CRISPR-Cas9 into one LMNA allele in hiPSCs from an unrelated healthy individual (Figure S1B). hiPSCs that acquired no mutation served as controls. We isolated independent control and T10I clones; assessment of the top 10 Cas9 recognition sites did not identify off-target effects (Figure S1C). We proceeded with two validated clones per genotype and differentiated control and T10I hiPSCs into TNNT2+ CMs (Figure 1D). Flow cytometry across multiple biological replicates confirmed that more than 85% of control and T10I hiPSC-CMs expressed TNNT2 and MLC2v (Figures 1E and S1D; Lian et al., 2013Lian X. Zhang J.

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis (control, n = 4; T10I, n = 3) confirmed nearly equivalent expression of the mutant and wild-type LMNA alleles in T10I hiPSC-CMs (Figure S1E). Immunoblotting confirmed LAMIN A and LAMIN C protein in control and mutant hiPSC-CMs but not undifferentiated cells (noting a reduction in T10I hiPSC-CMs) (Figure S1F). Transfection of IMR90 human fibroblasts with Emerald-tagged LAMIN A or LAMIN A T10I also showed a reduced epitope-tagged LAMIN A signal for T10I compared with the control but equivalent Emerald expression (Figure S1G).

We measured the elastic and viscoelastic properties of single hiPSC-CMs using atomic force microscopy (AFM; Figures 1F and 1G). T10I hiPSC-CMs had a decreased Young’s modulus at physiological rates of mechanical stimulation (2-Hz indentation at 25 V; Figure 1F), impaired elastic properties at low rates of stimulation, and loss of normal viscoelasticity at high rates of stimulation (Figure 1G), consistent with other laminopathy models (Hale et al., 2008Hale C.M.

A Fluo-4 fluorescence calcium reporter assay demonstrated an unchanged amplitude of spontaneous calcium transients in T10I hiPSC-CMs, but mutants showed a faster time to peak calcium concentration and lower basal fluorescence compared with control cells (Figure 1H). Multiple indices of myocyte contraction performed in single hiPSC-CMs or those grown in 3D micropatterned cultures were reduced in T10I compared with control cells (Figures 1I and 1J). These data indicate that T10I hiPSC-CMs recapitulate physiological abnormalities observed in individuals with LMNA mutations and DCM.

We visualized control and T10I hiPSC-CMs by immunofluorescence and blindly scored nuclei as normal (elliptical), mild defect (slight invagination), or severe defect (multiple invaginations or nuclear rupture/micronuclei). Control hiPSC-CMs demonstrated mostly normal nuclei. T10I hiPSC-CMs showed significantly more mild and severely defective nuclei on days 25 (mid-point) and 45 (later time point) of CM differentiation (Figures 2A and 2B ), which was particularly noticeable in multinucleated cells. Severely defective nuclei were also observed in mutants on days 9–10, prior to onset of gross contraction (Figure S1H). Consistent with previous work (Kind et al., 2013Kind J. Pagie L.

We hypothesized that T10I disrupts peripheral chromatin organization in hiPSC-CMs. LB1 is exclusive to the periphery whereas LAMIN A/C is not (Gesson et al., 2016Gesson K. Rescheneder P.

A-type lamins bind both hetero- and euchromatin, the latter being regulated by lamina-associated polypeptide 2 alpha.Genome Res. 2016; 26: 462-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). LB1-occupied chromatin represents the majority of peripheral LAMIN A/C-bound chromatin (Discussion; Meuleman et al., 2013Meuleman W. Peric-Hupkes D. Kind J. Beaudry J.B. Pagie L. Kellis M.

Constitutive nuclear lamina-genome interactions are highly conserved and associated with A/T-rich sequence.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We confirmed LB1 antibody specificity for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP; Figure S2A) and performed ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) on day 25 control and T10I hiPSC-CMs (Figure 2D; Table S1). We merged biological replicates with high reproducibility (control, n = 3; T10I, n = 4) (Figure S2E) and identified LAMIN B1-associated domains (LADs) using Enriched Domain Detector (EDD) (Figure 2D; Lund et al., 2014Lund E. Oldenburg A.R. Collas P. Enriched domain detector: a program for detection of wide genomic enrichment domains robust against local variations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: e92Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In control and T10I hiPSC-CMs, we identified 750–800 LADs (Table S1) occupying ∼25% of the genome. Approximately 18.5% of LAD coverage was shared (shared LADs), with ∼6.7% of control LAD coverage lost in T10I cells (control-only LADs) and ∼6.0% of T10I LAD coverage gained and unique to T10I cells (T10I-only LADs) (Figure 2E; Table S1). Parallel trends were observed in day 45 control and T10I hiPSC-CM ChIP-seq (control and T10I, n = 4; Figures S2B and S2C; Table S1). RNA-seq on day 25 (Table S2) confirmed that genes in control and T10I hiPSC-CM LADs are significantly repressed relative to non-LAD genes (Figure 2F). To determine the consistency of pathologic LMNA variants, we established a second set of hiPSC lines harboring the mutation LMNA R541C from an individual (hereafter called R541C; Figure S2D). The R541C individual also presented with DCM (explanted myocardium was not available for further analysis). We validated independent clones via sequencing for off-target effects (Figure S2E) and proceeded with two validated clones. Flow cytometry indicated consistent and efficient differentiation (Figure S2F). RNA-seq on day 25 (control and R541C, n = 4; Table S2) confirmed equal transcription from mutant and wild-type LMNA alleles in the heterozygous mutants (Figure S2G), and LAMIN A and C proteins were confirmed by immunoblotting (Figure S2H). Validated control lines were generated during construction of mutants and confirmed to not harbor T10I/R541C mutations. We combined datasets from the control lines to create a union control for subsequent analyses. Similar to T10I, AFM of R541C hiPSC-CMs showed impaired elastic properties at physiologic rates of mechanical stimulation (2 Hz) and decreased viscoelastic response to a range of stimulations (Figures S3A and S3B). R541C hiPSC-CMs also demonstrated a significantly faster time to peak cytosolic calcium concentration compared with control cells and slightly lower basal calcium concentrations (Figure S3C). R541C hiPSC-CMs showed a significant subset of cells with mild and severe nuclear morphology defects and disruption of H3K9me2 at the nuclear periphery (Figure S3D). We defined LADs (Table S1) from LB1 ChIP-seq in R541C hiPSC-CMs (n = 3; Figure S3E) and confirmed that LAD genes were relatively less expressed compared with non-LAD genes (Figure S3F; Table S2). Principal-component analysis (PCA) of the hiPSC-CM ChIP-seq data showed distinct separation of T10I and R541C LADs from control LADs (Figure S3G). Domains of H3K9me2-modified chromatin (H3K9 dimethylated domains [KDDs]) closely mirror LADs under physiological conditions (Poleshko et al., 2017Poleshko A. Shah P.P. Gupta M. Babu A. Morley M.P.

We performed H3K9me2 ChIP-seq in control, T10I, and R541C hiPSC-CMs and defined KDDs (control and T10I, n = 4; R541C, n = 3; Figure S3A; Table S1). As with LADs, genes in KDDs were relatively less expressed compared with genes outside of KDDs (Figure S4B). PCA of KDDs and LADs from all hiPSC-CM datasets (Figure 2G) showed separation of mutant LADs and KDDs from controls. LADs from both mutants clustered together, suggesting a consistent LAD defect. PCA also showed greater separation between LB1 and H3K9me2 in mutant compared with control hiPSC-CMs, suggesting that LAD/KDD co-occupancy may be reduced in the mutants. Because individual replicate data were combined for genomic analyses (unless indicated otherwise), any biases arising from differentiation or ChIP variability are attenuated in the final data. Collectively, these data establish that two different LMNA variants result in grossly abnormal nuclei and disruption of chromatin-lamina interactions, as defined by LB1 or H3K9me2 occupancy in hiPSC-CMs. Laminopathy phenotypes are often tissue restricted. Thus, we assessed T10I and R541C in different cell types. We differentiated control, T10I, and R541C hiPSCs into hepatocytes (hiPSC-heps) (Cai et al., 2008Cai J. DeLaForest A. Fisher J. Urick A.

We performed LB1 and H3K9me2 ChIP-seq and defined LADs and KDDs in control, T10I, and R541C hiPSC-heps (each genotype, n = 2 replicates/ChIP condition; Figures 3C, 3D, and S4G; Table S1). PCA and visual inspection of the data showed close clustering of mutant LADs and KDDs with control hiPSC-hep LADs and KDDs unlike in hiPSC-CMs (Figures 3D and S4H). We also differentiated hiPSCs into adipocytes (hiPSC-adips; Su et al., 2018Su S. Guntur A.R. Nguyen D.C. Fakory S.S. Doucette C.C. Leech C. Lotana H. Kelley M. Kohli J.

A portion of T10I hiPSC-adips had more mildly defective nuclei than control cells but few severely defective nuclei, unlike hiPSC-CMs (compare Figures 3E, S4J, and S5A with Figures 2A, 2B, and S3D). AFM showed reduced elasticity of T10I compared with control hiPSC-adips (Figure S4K), but the differences were minor compared with hiPSC-CMs (Figure S4L). hiPSC-adip LADs and KDDs (Table S1), defined from LB1 and H3K9me2 ChIP-seq (n = 2/genotype), also showed minor changes (Figures S5A and S5B; Table S1). LAD PCA (Figure 3F) or LAD/KDD PCA (Figure S5C) of all three cell types showed separation of mutant hiPSC-CM LADs or KDDs from controls, whereas mutant hiPSC-adips or hiPSC-heps showed minimal differences from cell-type controls (Figures 3F and S5C). Thus, T10I and R541C LADs and KDDs are preferentially disrupted in hiPSC-CMs. PCA also showed separation of control hiPSC-CMs,"
https://openalex.org/W3127310623,"Interneurons expressing cholecystokinin (CCK) and parvalbumin (PV) constitute two key GABAergic controllers of hippocampal pyramidal cell output. Although the temporally precise and millisecond-scale inhibitory regulation of neuronal ensembles delivered by PV interneurons is well established, the in vivo recruitment patterns of CCK-expressing basket cell (BC) populations has remained unknown. We show in the CA1 of the mouse hippocampus that the activity of CCK BCs inversely scales with both PV and pyramidal cell activity at the behaviorally relevant timescales of seconds. Intervention experiments indicated that the inverse coupling of CCK and PV GABAergic systems arises through a mechanism involving powerful inhibitory control of CCK BCs by PV cells. The tightly coupled complementarity of two key microcircuit regulatory modules demonstrates a novel form of brain-state-specific segregation of inhibition during spontaneous behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3126428981,"Salinity is among the most important abiotic stresses, which negatively affect growth, nutrient uptake and yield of crop plants. Application of different micronutrients, particularly zinc (Zn) have the potential to ameliorate the negative impacts of salinity stress. However, the role of Zn in improving salinity tolerance of basil ( Ocimum basilicum L.) is poorly understood. This study evaluated the impact of different Zn levels (0, 5 and 10 mg kg -1 ) on growth and nutrient acquisition traits of basil under different salinity levels (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5% NaCl). Data relating to biomass production, chlorophyll index, sodium (Na), potassium (K) uptake, K/Na ratio, Zn, copper (Cu), manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) uptake were recorded. Increasing salinity level reduced biomass production, chlorophyll index and nutrient uptake traits (except for Na and Fe accumulation) of basil. Zinc application (10 mg kg -1 ) improved biomass production, chlorophyll index and nutrient acquisition traits under normal as well as saline conditions. The reduction in chlorophyll index and biomass production was higher under 0 and 5 mg kg -1 than 10 mg kg -1 Zn application. The K concentration decreased under increasing salinity; however, Zn application improved K uptake under normal as well as saline conditions. Different growth and nutrient acquisition traits had negative correlations with Na accumulation; however, no positive correlation was recorded among growth and nutrient uptake traits. The results revealed that Zn application could improve the salinity tolerance of basil. However, actual biochemical and genetic mechanisms involved in Zn-induced salinity tolerance warrant further investigation."

Previous work has focused on how to formulate messages in terms of style and content, rather than on who should send them. In particular, little is known about the impact of spokesperson selection on message propagation during times of crisis. We report on the effectiveness of different public figures at promoting social distancing among 12,194 respondents from six countries that were severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic at the time of data collection. Across countries and demographic strata, immunology expert Dr. Anthony Fauci achieved the highest level of respondents’ willingness to reshare a call to social distancing, followed by a government spokesperson. Celebrity spokespersons were least effective. The likelihood of message resharing increased with age and when respondents expressed positive sentiments towards the spokesperson. These results contribute to the development of evidence-based knowledge regarding the effectiveness of prominent official and non-official public figures in communicating public health messaging in times of crisis. Our findings serve as a reminder that scientific experts and governments should not underestimate their power to inform and persuade in times of crisis and underscore the crucial importance of selecting the most effective messenger in propagating messages of lifesaving information during a pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3128908637,"Previous work has suggested androgen receptor (AR) signaling mediates prostate cancer progression in part through the modulation of autophagy. However, clinical trials testing autophagy inhibition using chloroquine derivatives in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) have yet to yield promising results, potentially due to the side effects of this class of compounds. We hypothesized that identification of the upstream activators of autophagy in prostate cancer could highlight alternative, context-dependent targets for blocking this important cellular process during disease progression. Here, we used molecular, genetic, and pharmacological approaches to elucidate an AR-mediated autophagy cascade involving Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2; a kinase with a restricted expression profile), 5’-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), but independent of canonical mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity. Increased CAMKK2-AMPK-ULK1 signaling correlated with disease progression in genetic mouse models and patient tumor samples. Importantly, CAMKK2 disruption impaired tumor growth and prolonged survival in multiple CRPC preclinical mouse models. Similarly, an inhibitor of AMPK-ULK1 blocked autophagy, cell growth, and colony formation in prostate cancer cells. Collectively, our findings converge to demonstrate that AR can co-opt the CAMKK2-AMPK-ULK1 signaling cascade to promote prostate cancer by increasing autophagy. Thus, this pathway may represent an alternative autophagic target in CRPC."
https://openalex.org/W3111371400,"With all the recent attention focused on big data, it is easy to overlook that basic vital statistics remain difficult to obtain in most of the world. What makes this frustrating is that private companies hold potentially useful data, but it is not accessible by the people who can use it to track poverty, reduce disease, or build urban infrastructure. This project set out to test whether we can transform an openly available dataset (Twitter) into a resource for urban planning and development. We test our hypothesis by creating road traffic crash location data, which is scarce in most resource-poor environments but essential for addressing the number one cause of mortality for children over five and young adults. The research project scraped 874,588 traffic related tweets in Nairobi, Kenya, applied a machine learning model to capture the occurrence of a crash, and developed an improved geoparsing algorithm to identify its location. We geolocate 32,991 crash reports in Twitter for 2012–2020 and cluster them into 22,872 unique crashes during this period. For a subset of crashes reported on Twitter, a motorcycle delivery service was dispatched in real-time to verify the crash and its location; the results show 92% accuracy. To our knowledge this is the first geolocated dataset of crashes for the city and allowed us to produce the first crash map for Nairobi. Using a spatial clustering algorithm, we are able to locate portions of the road network (&lt;1%) where 50% of the crashes identified occurred. Even with limitations in the representativeness of the data, the results can provide urban planners with useful information that can be used to target road safety improvements where resources are limited. The work shows how twitter data might be used to create other types of essential data for urban planning in resource poor environments."
https://openalex.org/W3126246654,"Summary Solid tumors are often characterized by a hypoxic microenvironment which contributes, through the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1, to the invasion-metastasis cascade. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress also leads tumor cells to thrive and spread by inducing a transcriptional and translational program, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), aimed at restoring ER homeostasis. We studied ERO1 alpha (henceforth ERO1), a protein disulfide oxidase with the tumor-relevant characteristic of being positively regulated by both ER stress and hypoxia. Analysis of the redox secretome indicated that pro-angiogenic HIF-1 targets, were blunted in ERO1-devoid breast cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. ERO1 deficiency reduced tumor cell migration and lung metastases by impinging on tumor angiogenesis, negatively regulating the upstream ATF4/CHOP branch of the UPR and selectively impeding oxidative folding of angiogenic factors, among which VEGF-A. Thus, ERO1 deficiency acted synergistically with the otherwise feeble curative effects of anti-angiogenic therapy in aggressive breast cancer murine models and it might be exploited to treat cancers with pathological HIF-1-dependent angiogenesis. Furthermore, ERO1 levels are higher in the more aggressive basal breast tumors and correlate inversely with the disease- and metastasis-free interval of breast cancer patients. Thus, taking advantage of our in vitro data on ERO1-regulated gene products we identified a gene set associated with ERO1 expression in basal tumors and related to UPR, hypoxia, and angiogenesis, whose levels might be investigated in patients as a hallmark of tumor aggressiveness and orient those with lower levels toward an effective anti-angiogenic therapy."

Healthcare workers (HCWs) were among the hardest hit by this event from both a working and psychological point of view. The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study is to assess the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian Occupational Physicians’ well-being and psychological distress, in relation to demographic and occupational characteristic, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown period. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey questionnaire from April 1 to April 21 st , 2020. To evaluate the level of psychological distress and the level of well-being, the general Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and the WHO-5 Wellbeing Index were utilized. Since the statistical assumptions were respected, we proceeded with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to ascertain the differences between the averages of the scores of the GHQ-12. Doctors who live in the most affected regions have a prevalence of psychological distress higher than their colleagues from the rest of Italy. ANOVA shows significant differences relating to the female gender, and to the life changes provoked by the lockdown for example not feeling sheltered at home or suffering from loneliness. This study showed a high prevalence of psychological distress in occupational physicians. To prevent the occurrence of mental disorders among Occupational Physicians, it is urgent to put in place policies of psychological support and well-being preservation."
https://openalex.org/W3127407421,"Obstructive sleep apnea is a highly prevalent cyclic repetitive hypoxia-normoxia respiratory sleep disorder characterized by intermittent upper-airway collapse. It is mainly diagnosed using in-laboratory polysomnography. However, the time-spatial constraints of this procedure limit its application. To overcome these limitations, there have been studies aiming to develop clinical prediction formulas for screening of obstructive sleep apnea using the risk factors for this disorder. However, the applicability of the formula is restricted by the group specific factors included in it. Therefore, we aimed to assess the risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea and develop clinical prediction formulas, which can be used in different situations, for screening and assessing this disorder. We enrolled 3,432 Asian adult participants with suspected obstructive sleep apnea who had successfully undergone in-laboratory polysomnography. All parameters were evaluated using correlation analysis and logistic regression. Among them, age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, anthropometric factors, Berlin questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores, and anatomical tonsil and tongue position were significantly associated with obstructive sleep apnea. To develop the clinical formulas for obstructive sleep apnea, the participants were divided into the development (n = 2,516) and validation cohorts (n = 916) based on the sleep laboratory visiting date. We developed and selected 13 formulas and divided them into those with and without physical examination based on the ease of application; subsequently, we selected suitable formulas based on the statistical analysis and clinical applicability (formula including physical exam: sensitivity, 0.776; specificity, 0.757; and AUC, 0.835; formula without physical exam: sensitivity, 0.749; specificity, 0.770; and AUC, 0.839). Analysis of the validation cohort with developed formulas showed that these models and formula had sufficient performance and goodness of fit of model. These tools can effectively utilize medical resources for obstructive sleep apnea screening in various situations."

While Staphylococcus spp. are commensal bacteria, they can become pathogenic, leading to various types of infections. In this study we aimed to characterize the virulence profiles of staphylococcal strains involved in difficult-to-treat skin and soft tissue infections, from both phenotypic and genotypic points of view. Phenotypic ability of the strains to secrete soluble virulence factors was assessed by a culturing dependent assay and their capacity to develop biofilms on inert substrate was screened by an adapted crystal violet microtiter method. We also tested the presence of several virulence genes by PCR. Most of the studied strains were isolated from purulent secretions of acne lesions and frequently secreted two or three soluble virulence factors. Most frequently secreted soluble virulence factors were caseinase (89%), lipase (71%) and lecithinase (67%). Almost half of the strains produced a well-represented biofilm. The molecular characterization showed the presence of the genes cna , hlg , clfA , and clfB . Staphylococcal strains that produce difficult-to-treat skin and soft tissue infections seem to be characterized by an enhanced ability to produce different soluble virulence factors and to develop biofilms in vitro . Further studies need to be developed in other Staphylococcus spp. infections in order to confirm this hypothesis."

Comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease were frequently associated with severity of the disease. WBC and neutrophil counts showed an increase, while lymphocyte counts decreased in patients with severe infection suggesting a possible neutrophil mediated organ damage, while immune activity may be diminished with decrease in lymphocytes leading to disease severity. Increase in SGOT, SGPT and blood urea suggests the functional deficiencies of liver, heart, and kidney in patients who succumbed to the disease when compared to the group of recovered patients. The WGS analysis showed that these isolates were classified into two clades: I/A3i, and A2a (four according to GISAID: O, L, GR, and GH). Further, WGS phylogeny and travel history together indicate possible transmission from Middle East and Europe. Three S protein variants: Wuhan reference, D614G, and Y28H were identified predicted to possess different binding affinities to host ACE2."

An important finding from this study is that in October 2016, just before the 2016 Presidential election, 74% of responding Americans were concerned about climate change. Climate change ranked as their second most serious global threat (behind terrorism). However, when asked to describe travel in the year 2050 only 29% of participants discussed lower carbon options, suggesting that actively envisioning a sustainable future was less prevalent than climate change concern. Enabling expectations and active anticipation of a low carbon future may help facilitate mitigation efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3128720400,"The contemporaneous effect of natural and anthropogenic factors involved in a watershed contribution to the seasonal and spatial variation of diatom community composition is widely discussed in the scientific literature. Yet, there is a paucity of scientific evidence indicating the effect of these factors on diatoms in tropical African regions characterized by distinct dry and wet seasons and season associated human activities like rainfed agriculture are commonly practiced. We applied multivariate techniques to determine the spatio-temporal drivers of diatom assemblage and diatom species richness in human influenced rivers and streams in Ethiopia. We simultaneously collected water and diatom samples from 24 sampling points during the wet (July) and dry (February) seasons. Both water and diatom samples were processed following standard procedures. We identified 169 species belonging to 45 genera in the studied lotic systems. We found that both season and land use factors were important in defining diatom composition (PERMANOVA, p&lt;0.05) and species richness (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05) patterns. Diatom community composition was driven by conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and turbidity parameters (Monte Carlo permutation test, p&lt;0.05). Besides, diatom species richness was driven by dissolved oxygen, soluble reactive phosphorus, and turbidity (GLMM, p&lt;0.05). The study highlighted physicochemical parameters influenced by seasonal variation and human activity determined the composition of diatoms. This implies that the unique feature of heavy rain during the rainy season in the region followed by extensive flooding aggravated by the steep slope from the highlands to the lowlands plays a major role in shaping the diatom autecology in the region. Therefore, in applying biomonitoring in such regions considering the effect of runoff and dilution is imperative."
https://openalex.org/W3127911265,"Background Intestinal parasitosis is a major public health problem that affects the health of primary school children in low- and middle-income countries where water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) conditions are deficient. Since there is a paucity of information on the prevalence and associated factors of this problem among primary school children in Dessie City in Ethiopia, this study was designed to address these gaps. Methods A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 407 stratified-sampled primary school children in five primary schools at Dessie City from April to June 2018. Data were collected using a pretested structured questionnaire, an observation checklist and laboratory analysis of stool samples. Stool specimen from each study participant was collected using clean, properly labeled and leak-proof stool cup. A portion of stool from each study participant collected sample was processed using saline wet mount technique and examined by microscope. The remaining specimens were preserved with 10% formalin and transported to Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital laboratory to be processed by using formol-ether concentration technique. Then, slide smears were prepared from each processed stool specimen and finally, it was microscopically examined with 10x as well as 40x objectives for the presence or absence of intestinal parasites. Factors significantly associated with intestinal parasitosis were determined using binary logistic regression model at 95% CI (confidence interval). Thus, bivariate (COR [crude odds ratio]) and multivariable (AOR [adjusted odds ratio]) logistic regression analyses were carried out. From the multivariable analysis, variables having a p -value of less than 0.05 were declared as factors significantly associated with intestinal parasitosis among primary school children. Main findings The overall prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was found to be 16.0% (95% CI: 12.5–19.4%), of these, 50.8% were positive for protozoa, 32.2% for helminth infections and 16.9% for double co-infections. Entamoeba histolytica was the most prevalent parasite (29.2%), followed by Giardia lamblia (21.5%), Ascaris lumbricoides (18.5%), Hymenolepis nana ( 9.2%) and Enterobius vermicularis (4.6%). Prevalence rates were similar among government (16.3%) and private (15.7%) school children. Water consumption was less than 5 liters per capita per day in 4 of the 5 schools. Thirty-eight (9.3%) of primary school students reported that they practiced open defecation. About two-thirds (285, 70.0%) said they always washed their hands after defecation. Mother’s education (illiterate) (AOR = 3.3; 95% CI: 1.20–9.37), father’s education (illiterate) (AOR = 3.9; 95% CI : 1.40–10.82) , fathers who could read and write (AOR = 3.3; 95% CI: 1.25–7.86) , handwashing before meal (sometimes) (AOR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.11–4.17) and poor knowledge of WASH (AOR = 9.3; 95% CI: 2.17–16.70) were statistically associated with presence of intestinal parasitic infections. Conclusion We concluded that the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis in the study area among Grades 4–8 primary school children had public health significance. Factors significantly associated with intestinal parasitosis among primary school children’s were illiterate mothers and fathers, irregular handwashing of children before meals, and poor knowledge of WASH. Health education to improve students’ WASH knowledge and mass deworming for parasites are recommended as preventive measures; and improvements to the quality of WASH facilities in primary schools are strongly recommended to support these measures."
https://openalex.org/W3127944707,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an ESKAPE pathogen associated with difficult-to-treat burn wound and surgical-site infections. This study aimed to characterise an extensively drug resistant (XDR) P . aeruginosa isolate (designated PAW1) and to investigate the antibiofilm and antipersister effect of acetic acid on PAW1. PAW1 was identified using biotypic (VITEK) and genotypic (16S rDNA) analysis. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disc susceptibility testing showed high level resistance against all antibiotics from classes including beta lactams, cephems, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones. It was therefore identified as extensively drug resistant (XDR), showing resistance to all antibiotics except for, aminoglycoside (gentamicin and netilmicin) and lipopeptides (polymyxin B). Time kill assays showed antibiotic tolerant, persister cell formation in presence of 100X MICs of gentamicin and polymyxin B. Other virulence traits such as ability to produce lipase, protease, haemolysin, and siderophores and to form biofilms were additional factors which may contribute to its pathogenicity. PAW1 showed promising susceptibility against acetic acid with MIC and minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration of 0.156% (v/v). Percent viability of PAW1 was dependent on dose and treatment time of acetic acid. 0.625% acetic acid treatment of 5 minutes was effective in killing &gt;90% planktonic cells showing lesser toxicity to L929 cells (IC 50 = 0.625%). Biofilm disruption caused due to acetic acid was also dose dependent, showing 40.57% disruption after treatment with 0.625% acetic acid for 5 minutes. FESEM imaging and live dead staining of planktonic and biofilm forms of PAW1 confirmed that acetic acid treatment caused 19.04% of cell shrinkage and disruption of extracellular matrix resulting in killing of cells. Antipersister activity of acetic acid was demonstrated by showing complete killing of PAW1 at 4X MIC. Overall, this study characterised an XDR isolate P . aeruginosa showing resistance and tolerance to various antibiotics. Antipersister and antibiofilm effect of acetic acid demonstrates the importance of forgotten topical agents as an effective strategy to treat XDR pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3117506216,"Introduction Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females worldwide. According to the Addis Ababa cancer registry, it is the first in male and fourth in female in Ethiopia. However, there have not been studies on prognostic factors and survival of colorectal cancer. Hence, this study aimed to estimate survival time and identify prognostic factors. Methods In this institution based retrospective study, medical records review of 422 colorectal cancer patients and telephone interview was used as sources of data. Survival time was estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimator. Prognostic factors were identified using the multivariable Cox regression model. Results Patients diagnosed with rectal cancer had 76% (HR: 1.761, 95% CI: 1.173–2.644) increased risk of dying compared to colon cancer patients. Node positive patients were 3.146 (95% CI: 1.626–6.078) times likely to die compared to node-negative and metastatic cancer were 4.221 (95% CI: 2.788–6.392) times likely to die compared to non-metastatic patients. Receiving adjuvant therapy reduced the risk of death by 36.1% (HR: 0.639 (95% CI: 0.418–0.977)) compared to patients who had an only surgical resection. The median survival time was 39 months and the overall five years survival rate was 33%. Conclusions The overall survival rate was low and a majority of the patients were young at presentation. Patient’s survival is largely influenced by the advanced cancer stage at presentation and delays in the administration of adjuvant therapy. Receiving adjuvant therapy was among the good prognostic factors."

Understanding changes in young people’s sexual and reproductive health (SRH) behaviours and the associated factors is important for framing appropriate interventions. Objective This study assessed changes in SRH behaviours of unmarried young people aged 15–24 and associated factors over a ten-year period in Nigeria. Data and method We analysed datasets from Nigeria Demographic and Health Surveys of 2008, 2013 and 2018 to assess changes in inconsistent condom use, non-use of modern contraceptives; multiple sexual partnership; and early sexual debut. Using binary logistic regression, we assessed the association of selected variables with the SRH behaviours. Results Over four-fifths of unmarried young people (15–24) in Nigeria engaged in at least one risky sexual behaviour in each survey year. The pattern of changes in the four risky SRH behaviours was consistent over the 10-year period, with the highest rates of each behaviour occurring in 2018 while the lowest rates were in 2013, thus indicating an increase in the proportion of respondents engaging in risky sexual behaviours over the study period. Comprehensive HIV/AIDS knowledge, male gender, older age category (20–24), residence in south-west Nigeria, urban residence, higher socio-economic status, secondary/higher education were mostly protective against the four SRH variables analysed across the different data waves. Conclusion Addressing the high and increasing level of risky SRH behaviours among young people in Nigeria is imperative to improve overall national health status and to ensure progress towards achieving SDG target 3.7 focusing on SRH."
https://openalex.org/W3128272944,"Fibroblast growth factor signaling is essential for mammalian bone morphogenesis and growth, involving membranous ossification and endochondral ossification. FGF9 has been shown to be an important regulator of endochondral ossification; however, its role in the early differentiation of chondrocytes remains unknown. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine the role of FGF9 in the early differentiation of chondrogenesis. We found an increase in FGF9 expression during proliferating chondrocyte hypertrophy in the mouse growth plate. Silencing of FGF9 promotes the growth of ATDC5 cells and promotes insulin-induced differentiation of ATDC5 chondrocytes, which is due to increased cartilage matrix formation and type II collagen (col2a1) and X (col10a1), Acan, Ihh, Mmp13 gene expression. Then, we evaluated the effects of AKT, GSK-3β, and mTOR. Inhibition of FGF9 significantly inhibits phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3β, but does not affected the activation of mTOR. Furthermore, phosphorylation of inhibited AKT and GSK-3β was compensated using the AKT activator SC79, and differentiation of ATDC5 cells was inhibited. In conclusion, our results indicate that FGF9 acts as an important regulator of early chondrogenesis partly through the AKT/GSK-3β pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3128934535,"Introduction Dynamic PET/CT allows visualization of pharmacokinetics over the time, in contrast to static whole body PET/CT. The objective of this study was to assess 68 Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in pathological lesions and benign tissue, within 30 minutes after injection in primary prostate cancer (PCa) patients in test-retest setting. Materials and methods Five patients, with biopsy proven PCa, were scanned dynamically in list mode for 30 minutes on a digital PET/CT-scanner directly after an intravenous bolus injection of 100 MBq 68 Ga-PSMA-11. Approximately 45 minutes after injection a static whole body scan was acquired, followed by a one bed position scan of the pelvic region. The scans were repeated approximately four weeks later, without any intervention in between. Semi-quantitative assessment was performed using regions-of-interest in the prostate tumor, bladder, gluteal muscle and iliac artery. Time-activity curves were extracted from the counts in these regions and the intra-patient variability between both scans was assessed. Results The uptake of the iliac artery and gluteal muscle reached a plateau after 5 and 3 minutes, respectively. The population fell apart in two groups with respect to tumor uptake: in some patients the tumor uptake reached a plateau after 5 minutes, whereas in other patients the uptake kept increasing, which correlated with larger tumor volumes on PET/CT scan. Median intra-patient variation between both scans was 12.2% for artery, 9.7% for tumor, 32.7% for the bladder and 14.1% for the gluteal muscle. Conclusion Dynamic 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans, with a time interval of four weeks, are reproducible with a 10% variation in uptake in the primary prostate tumor. An uptake plateau was reached for the iliac artery and gluteal muscle within 5 minutes post-injection. A larger tumor volume seems to be related to continued tumor uptake. This information might be relevant for both response monitoring and PSMA-based radionuclide therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3128992408,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has yielded an unprecedented quantity of new publications, contributing to an overwhelming quantity of information and leading to the rapid dissemination of less stringently validated information. Yet, a formal analysis of how the medical literature has changed during the pandemic is lacking. In this analysis, we aimed to quantify how scientific publications changed at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We performed a cross-sectional bibliometric study of published studies in four high-impact medical journals to identify differences in the characteristics of COVID-19 related publications compared to non-pandemic studies. Original investigations related to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 published in March and April 2020 were identified and compared to non-COVID-19 research publications over the same two-month period in 2019 and 2020. Extracted data included publication characteristics, study characteristics, author characteristics, and impact metrics. Our primary measure was principal component analysis (PCA) of publication characteristics and impact metrics across groups. Results We identified 402 publications that met inclusion criteria: 76 were related to COVID-19; 154 and 172 were non-COVID publications over the same period in 2020 and 2019, respectively. PCA utilizing the collected bibliometric data revealed segregation of the COVID-19 literature subset from both groups of non-COVID literature (2019 and 2020). COVID-19 publications were more likely to describe prospective observational (31.6%) or case series (41.8%) studies without industry funding as compared with non-COVID articles, which were represented primarily by randomized controlled trials (32.5% and 36.6% in the non-COVID literature from 2020 and 2019, respectively). Conclusions In this cross-sectional study of publications in four general medical journals, COVID-related articles were significantly different from non-COVID articles based on article characteristics and impact metrics. COVID-related studies were generally shorter articles reporting observational studies with less literature cited and fewer study sites, suggestive of more limited scientific support. They nevertheless had much higher dissemination."

These results indicate a modulating effect of TRPV1 on the EP3 receptor-mediated cough responses to PGE 2 likely through the vagal sensory nerve. This study aimed to determine whether 1) inhalation of aerosolized JNJ 17203212 and L-798106 affected cough responses to citric acid (CA, mainly stimulating TRPV1) and PGE 2 ; 2) TRPV1 and EP3 receptor morphologically are co-expressed and electrophysiologically functioned in the individual of vagal pulmonary C-neurons (cell bodies of bronchopulmonary C-fibers in the nodose/jugular ganglia); and 3) there was a cross-effect of TRPV1 and EP3 receptor on these neural excitations. To this end, aerosolized CA or PGE 2 was inhaled by unanesthetized guinea pigs pretreated without or with each antagonist given in aerosol form. Immunofluorescence was applied to identify the co-expression of TRPV1 and EP3 receptor in vagal pulmonary C-neurons (retrogradely traced by DiI). Whole-cell voltage patch clamp approach was used to detect capsaicin (CAP)- and PGE 2 -induced currents in individual vagal pulmonary C-neurons and determine the effects of the TRPV1 and EP3 receptor antagonists on the evoked currents. We found that PGE 2 -induced cough was attenuated by JNJ 17203212 or L-798106 and CA-evoked cough greatly suppressed only by JNJ 17203212. Approximately 1/4 of vagal pulmonary C-neurons co-expressed EP3 with a cell size &lt; 20 μm. Both CAP- and PGE 2 -induced currents could be recorded in the individuals of some vagal pulmonary C-neurons. The former was largely inhibited only by JNJ 17203212, while the latter was suppressed by JNJ 17203212 or L-798106. The similarity of the cross-effect of both antagonists on cough and vagal pulmonary C-neural activity suggests that a subgroup of vagal pulmonary C-neurons co-expressing TRPV1 and EP3 receptor is, at least in part, responsible for the cough response to PGE 2 ."
https://openalex.org/W3126773870,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death among women. Breast cancers are generally diagnosed and treated based on clinical and histopathological features, along with subtype classification determined by the Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay (also known as PAM50). Currently the copy number alteration (CNA) landscape of the tumour is not considered. We set out to examine the role of genomic instability (GI) in breast cancer survival since CNAs reflect GI and correlate with survival in other cancers. We focused on the 70% of breast cancers classified as luminal and carried out a comprehensive survival and association analysis using Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) data to determine whether CNA Score Quartiles derived from absolute CNA counts are associated with survival. Analysis revealed that patients diagnosed with luminal A breast cancer have a CNA landscape associated with disease specific survival, suggesting that CNA Score can provide a statistically robust prognostic factor. Furthermore, stratification of patients into subtypes based on gene expression has shown that luminal A and B cases overlap, and it is in this region we largely observe luminal A cases with reduced survival outlook. Therefore, luminal A breast cancer patients with quantitatively elevated CNA counts may benefit from more aggressive therapy. This demonstrates how individual genomic landscapes can facilitate personalisation of therapeutic interventions to optimise survival outcomes."

In one example of this flexibility, to catalyze the NADH:quinone oxidoreductase step of the respiratory chain, P . aeruginosa has three different enzymes: NUO, NQR and NDH2, all of which carry out the same redox function but have different energy conservation and ion transport properties. In order to better understand the roles of these enzymes, we constructed two series of mutants: (i) three single deletion mutants, each of which lacks one NADH dehydrogenase and (ii) three double deletion mutants, each of which retains only one of the three enzymes. All of the mutants grew approximately as well as wild type, when tested in rich and minimal medium and in a range of pH and [Na + ] conditions, except that the strain with only NUO (Δ nqrF Δ ndh ) has an extended lag phase. During exponential phase, the NADH dehydrogenases contribute to total wild-type activity in the following order: NQR &gt; NDH2 &gt; NUO. Some mutants, including the strain without NQR (Δ nqrF ) had increased biofilm formation, pyocyanin production, and killed more efficiently in both macrophage and mouse infection models. Consistent with this, Δ nqrF showed increased transcription of genes involved in pyocyanin production."

Differences between the thermal performance of local and invasive species can alter species interactions, including predator-prey interactions. The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus , is a known vector of several viral diseases of public health importance. It has successfully invaded many regions across the globe and currently threatens to invade regions of the UK where conditions would support seasonal activity. We assessed the functional response and predation efficiency (percentage of prey consumed) of the cyclopoid copepods Macrocyclops albidus and Megacyclops viridis from South East England, UK against newly-hatched French Ae . albopictus larvae across a relevant temperature range (15, 20, and 25°C). Predator-absent controls were included in all experiments to account for background prey mortality. We found that both M . albidus and M . viridis display type II functional response curves, and that both would therefore be suitable biocontrol agents in the event of an Ae . albopictus invasion in the UK. No significant effect of temperature on the predation interaction was detected by either type of analysis. However, the predation efficiency analysis did show differences due to predator species. The results suggest that M . viridis would be a superior predator against invasive Ae . albopictus larvae due to the larger size of this copepod species, relative to M . albidus . Our work highlights the importance of size relationships in predicting interactions between invading prey and local predators."
https://openalex.org/W3126257602,"HER2 amplification greatly contributes to the tumorigenesis of multiple cancers. Intronic miR-4728-5p is transcribed along with its host gene HER2. However, little is known about the role of miR-4728-5p in cancer. This study aims to elucidate the potential role of miR-4728-5p and the underlying mechanism in breast cancer. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that higher expression of HER2 led to worse survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. The TCGA dataset revealed that compared to normal breast tissues, HER2 and miR-4728-5p levels were significantly upregulated in breast cancer tissues with a positive correlation. In functional assays, miR-4728-5p was confirmed to promote the proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell BT474. EBP1 was identified as a direct target of miR-4728-5p via bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays. miR-4728-5p was further demonstrated to increase HER2 expression and promote cell proliferation and migration by directly inhibiting EBP1 in breast cancer. Taken together, the HER2-intronic miR-4728-5p/EBP1/HER2 feedback loop plays an important role in promoting breast cancer cell proliferation and migration. Our study provides novel insights for targeted therapies of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3126514280,"Jacobaea vulgaris Gaertn. or common ragwort is a widespread noxious grassland weed that is subject to different regulation measures worldwide. Seedling emergence and growth are the most crucial stages for most plants during their life cycle. Therefore, heterospecific grass or conspecific ragwort litter as well as soil-mediated effects may be of relevance for ragwort control. Our study examines the effects of conspecific and heterospecific litter as well as ragwort conditioned soil on seedling emergence and growth. We conducted pot experiments to estimate the influence of soil conditioning (with, without ragwort), litter type (grass, ragwort, grass-ragwort-mix) and amount (200 g/m², 400 g/m²) on J . vulgaris recruitment. As response parameters, we assessed seedling number, biomass, height and number of seedling leaves. We found that 200 g/m² grass litter led to higher seedling numbers, while litter composed of J . vulgaris reduced seedling emergence. Litter amounts of 400 g/m² had negative effects on the number of seedlings regardless of the litter type. Results for biomass, plant height and leaf number showed opposing patterns to seedling numbers. Seedlings in pots treated with high litter amounts and seedlings in ragwort litter became heavier, grew higher and had more leaves. Significant effects of the soil conditioned by ragwort on seedling emergence and growth were negligible. The study confirms that the amount and composition of litter strongly affect seedling emergence and growth of J . vulgaris . Moreover, while conspecific litter and high litter amounts negatively affected early seedling development in ragwort, those seedlings that survived accumulated more biomass and got taller than seedlings grown in heterospecific or less dense litter. Therefore, ragwort litter has negative effects in ragwort germination, but positive effects in ragwort growth. Thus, leaving ragwort litter on pastures will not reduce ragwort establishment and growth and cannot be used as management tool."
https://openalex.org/W3127160949,"Direct measurements of gross primary productivity (GPP) in the water column are essential, but can be spatially and temporally restrictive. Fast repetition rate fluorometry (FRRf) is a bio-optical technique based on chlorophyll a (Chl- a ) fluorescence that can estimate the electron transport rate (ETR PSII ) at photosystem II (PSII) of phytoplankton in real time. However, the derivation of phytoplankton GPP in carbon units from ETR PSII remains challenging because the electron requirement for carbon fixation (Ф e,C ), which is mechanistically 4 mol e − mol C −1 or above, can vary depending on multiple factors. In addition, FRRf studies are limited in freshwater lakes where phosphorus limitation and cyanobacterial blooms are common. The goal of the present study is to construct a robust Ф e,C model for freshwater ecosystems using simultaneous measurements of ETR PSII by FRRf with multi-excitation wavelengths coupled with a traditional carbon fixation rate by the 13 C method. The study was conducted in oligotrophic and mesotrophic parts of Lake Biwa from July 2018 to May 2019. The combination of excitation light at 444, 512 and 633 nm correctly estimated ETR PSII of cyanobacteria. The apparent range of Ф e,C in the phytoplankton community was 1.1–31.0 mol e − mol C −1 during the study period. A generalised linear model showed that the best fit including 12 physicochemical and biological factors explained 67% of the variance in Ф e,C . Among all factors, water temperature was the most significant, while photosynthetically active radiation intensity was not. This study quantifies the in situ FRRf method in a freshwater ecosystem, discusses core issues in the methodology to calculate Ф e,C , and assesses the applicability of the method for lake GPP prediction."
https://openalex.org/W3128171461,"Objective Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is one of the markers of biological aging as shortening occurs over time. Shorter LTL has been associated with adiposity and a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases. The objective was to assess LTL and LTL shortening during the first 2 years of life in healthy, term-born infants and to associate LTL shortening with potential stressors and body composition. Study design In 145 healthy, term-born infants (85 boys), we measured LTL in blood, expressed as telomere to single-gene copy ratio (T/S ratio), at 3 months and 2 years by quantitative PCR technique. Fat mass (FM) was assessed longitudinally by PEAPOD, DXA, and abdominal FM by ultrasound. Results LTL decreased by 8.5% from 3 months to 2 years (T/S ratio 4.10 vs 3.75, p&lt;0.001). LTL shortening from 3 months to 2 years associated with FM%(R = 0.254), FM index(R = 0.243) and visceral FM(R = 0.287) at 2 years. LTL shortening tended to associate with gain in FM% from 3 to 6 months (R = 0.155, p = 0.11), in the critical window for adiposity programming. There was a trend to a shorter LTL in boys at 2 years(p = 0.056). LTL shortening from 3 months to 2 years was not different between sexes. Conclusion We present longitudinal LTL values and show that LTL shortens considerably (8.5%) during the first 2 years of life. LTL shortening during first 2 years of life was associated with FM%, FMI and visceral FM at age 2 years, suggesting that adverse adiposity programming in early life could contribute to more LTL shortening."

Morphometric traits and measurements, isozyme phenotypes, and molecular analysis clearly differentiated this nematode from previously described root-knot nematodes. This new species is described, illustrated and named Meloidogyne vitis sp. nov. The new species can be distinguished from other Meloidogyne spp. by a unique combination of characters. Females display a prominent neck, an excretory pore is located on the ventral region between 23rd and 25th annule behind lips, an EP/ST ratio of approximately 2.5 (1.98–2.96), a perineal pattern with two large and prominent phasmids, and a labial disc fused with the medial lips to form a dumbbell-shaped structure. Males display an obvious head region, a labial disc fused with the medial lips to form a dumbbell-shaped structure, no lateral lips, a prominent slit-like opening between the labial disc and medial lips, a distinct sunken appearance of the middle of the medial lips, and four incisures in the lateral field. Second-stage juveniles are characterized by a head region with slightly wrinkled mark, a labial disc fused with the medial lips to form a dumbbell-shaped structure, a slightly sunken appearance of the middle of the medial lips, a slit-like amphidial openings between the labial disc and lateral lips, and four incisures in the lateral field. The new species has rare Mdh (N3d) and Est phenotypes (VF1). Phylogenetic analysis based on ITS1-5.8S-ITS2, D2D3 fragments of rDNA, and coxI and coxII fragments of mtDNA sequences clearly separated the new species from other root-knot nematodes, and the closest relative was Meloidogyne mali . Meloidogyne mali was collected for amplifying these sequences as mentioned above, which were compared with the corresponding sequences of new species, the result showed that all of these sequences with highly base divergence (48–210 base divergence).

https://openalex.org/W3126629926,"As the two limiting nutrients for plants in most terrestrial ecosystems, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are essential for the development of succession forests. Vegetation N:P stoichiometry is a useful tool for detecting nutrient limitation. In the present work, chronosequence analysis was employed to research N and P accumulation dynamics and their stoichiometry during forest primary succession in a glacier retreat area on the Tibetan Plateau. Our results showed that: (1) total ecosystem N and P pools increased from 97 kg hm −2 to 7186 kg hm −2 and 25 kg hm −2 to 487 kg hm −2 , respectively, with increasing glacier retreat year; (2) the proportion of the organic soil N pool to total ecosystem N sharply increased with increasing glacier retreat year, but the proportion of the organic soil and the vegetation P pools to the total ecosystem P was equivalent after 125 y of recession; (3) the N:P ratio for tree leaves ranged from 10.1 to 14.3, whereas the N:P ratio for total vegetation decreased form 13.3 to 8.4 and remained constant after 35 y of recession, and the N:P ratio for organic soil increased from 0.2 to 23.1 with increasing glacier retreat. These results suggested that organic soil N increased with increasing years of glacier retreat, which may be the main sink for atmospheric N, whereas increased P accumulation in vegetation after 125 y of recession suggested that much of the soil P was transformed into the biomass P pool. As the N:P ratio for vegetation maintained a low level for 35–125 y of recession, we suggested that N might be the main limiting element for plant growth in the development of this ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W3126643161,"Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic pain and a striking discrepancy between objective signs of tissue damage and severity of pain. Function and structural alterations in brain areas involved in pain processing may explain this feature. Previous case-control studies in fibromyalgia focused on acute pain processing using experimentally-evoked pain paradigms. Yet, these studies do not allow conclusions about chronic, stimulus-independent pain. Resting-state cerebral blood flow (rsCBF) acquired by arterial spin labelling (ASL) may be a more accurate marker for chronic pain. The objective was to integrate four different functional and structural neuroimaging markers to evaluate the neural correlate of chronic, stimulus-independent pain using a resting-state paradigm. In line with the pathophysiological concept of enhanced central pain processing we hypothesized that rsCBF is increased in fibromyalgia in areas involved in processing of acute pain. We performed an age matched case-control study of 32 female fibromyalgia patients and 32 pain-free controls and calculated group differences in rsCBF, resting state functional connectivity, grey matter volume and cortical thickness using whole-brain and region of interest analyses. We adjusted all analyses for depression and anxiety. As centrally acting drugs are likely to interfere with neuroimaging markers, we performed a subgroup analysis limited to patients not taking such drugs. We found no differences between cases and controls in rsCBF of the thalamus, the basal ganglia, the insula, the somatosensory cortex, the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulum and supplementary motor area as brain areas previously identified to be involved in acute processing in fibromyalgia. The results remained robust across all neuroimaging markers and when limiting the study population to patients not taking centrally acting drugs and matched controls. In conclusion, we found no evidence for functional or structural alterations in brain areas involved in acute pain processing in fibromyalgia that could reflect neural correlates of chronic stimulus-independent pain."

Several studies have reported the adverse effects of malnutrition on functional outcomes; however, the association between nutritional status and activities of daily living is unclear among patients with Parkinson’s disease. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between nutritional status and activities of daily living in patients with Parkinson’s disease. We conducted a retrospective cohort study with the data of 124 patients who were consecutively admitted to a rehabilitation hospital in Japan, among whom the data of 61 patients were included in the analyses. The Controlling Nutritional Status score was used to measure the nutritional status of the participants, and the motor subdomain of the Functional Independence Measure was used to assess the activities of daily living. Piecewise linear mixed-effects models were fitted to the data after adjusting for confounding factors. A poor nutritional status (i.e., Controlling Nutritional Status score &gt;3) was significantly associated with a poor Functional Independence Measure gain, which was defined as difference in the score values of the Functional Independence Measures between discharge and admission. Our findings could aid in developing nutritional intervention programs for patients with Parkinson’s disease by employing the Controlling Nutritional Status score to improve their activities of daily living."

Pregnancies were classified by levels of potential exposure to immigration enforcement depending on parental nativity and educational attainment. Contrast groups were foreign-born parents residing in nonadopting counties and all US-born non-Hispanic parents. The introduction of the program was estimated to decrease birth weight by 58.54 grams (95% confidence interval [CI], −83.52 to −33.54) with effects likely following from reduced intrauterine growth. These results are shown to coexist with a worsening in the timing of initiation and frequency of prenatal care received. Since birth outcomes influence health, education, and earnings trajectories, our findings suggest that the uptick in ICE activities can have large socioeconomic costs over US-born citizens."
https://openalex.org/W3128276244,"Objective To evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of middle-aged and elderly people with hypertension in Enshi, China, and to explore the important correlates defining HRQoL. Methods From April through July 2018, a self-monitoring intervention program for hypertension control was implemented in a remote area of central China. Participants completed a cross-sectional survey which included demographic characteristics, the Health-related Quality of Life Survey, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Survey. Univariate analysis was performed by analysis of variance, and multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the influencing factors of HRQoL in middle-aged and elderly hypertensive patients. In the multivariate analysis, the variables with P≤0.05 in the single factor analysis were combined with the professional significance to establish a multiple linear regression model. Results Information from 500 participants was available for analysis. Among them, the scores of PCS and MCS was 31.66 ± 9.50 and 41.38 ± 10.69, respectively. Multivariable regression analyses showed that higher education and sleep quality, and moderate physical activity (30 minutes for at least five days a week) had a positive influence on PCS scores. Higher monthly family income (3,000–5,000 ¥) and sleep quality, regular tea-drinking, having 30 minutes of moderate physical activity at least five days a week were positively associated with MCS scores. Conclusion The overall HRQoL for rural middle-aged and elderly hypertensive patients in Xuan’en county of Hubei province was poor. Effective relevant measures for the above factors were urgently needed to improve the quality of life for the elderly in rural areas. Awareness of these relevant factors could help health care professionals provide better supportive care."
https://openalex.org/W3128509090,"Background Research on group antenatal care in low- and middle-income contexts suggests high acceptability and preliminary implementation success. Methods We studied the effect of group antenatal care on gestational age at birth among women in Rwanda, hypothesizing that participation would increase mean gestational length. For this unblinded cluster randomized trial, 36 health centers were pair-matched and randomized; half continued individual antenatal care (control), half implemented group antenatal care (intervention). Women who initiated antenatal care between May 2017 and December 2018 were invited to participate, and included in analyses if they presented before 24 weeks gestation, attended at least two visits, and their birth outcome was obtained. We used a generalized estimating equations model for analysis. Findings In total, 4091 women in 18 control clusters and 4752 women in 18 intervention clusters were included in the analysis. On average, women attended three total antenatal care visits. Gestational length was equivalent in the intervention and control groups (39.3 weeks (SD 1.6) and 39.3 weeks (SD 1.5)). There were no significant differences between groups in secondary outcomes except that more women in control sites attended postnatal care visits (40.1% versus 29.7%, p = 0.003) and more women in intervention sites attended at least three total antenatal care visits (80.7% versus 71.7%, p = 0.003). No harms were observed. Interpretation Group antenatal care did not result in a difference in gestational length between groups. This may be due to the low intervention dose. We suggest studies of both the effectiveness and costs of higher doses of group antenatal care among women at higher risk of preterm birth. We observed threats to group care due to facility staff shortages; we recommend studies in which antenatal care providers are exclusively allocated to group antenatal care during visits.

https://openalex.org/W3128764159,"Objective Inadequate diversity in clinical trials is widely recognized as a significant contributing factor to health disparities experienced by racial/ethnic minorities and other diverse populations in the US. To address this in a scalable way, we sought to develop a web tool that could help enhance underserved minority participation in clinical research. Methods We used our research literacy support flashcard tool as the initial prototype for human-centered design and usability testing of the web tool Health for All in public library settings. After forming partnerships with leadership from Chicago Public Libraries (CPL), local medical libraries, and the Chicago Department of Public Health, we conducted seven iterative design sessions with focus groups of library patrons and library staff from six CPL branches serving underserved communities followed by two rounds of usability testing and website modification. Results Based on the qualitative research findings from Design Sessions 1–7, we enacted the design decision of a website that was a hybrid of fact-filled and vignette (personal stories) paper prototypes divided into 4 modules (trust, diversity, healthy volunteers, pros/cons), each with their own outcome metrics. The website was thus constructed, and navigation issues identified in two rounds of usability testing by library patrons were addressed through further website modification, followed by the launch of a beta version of a hybridized single-scrolling and guided module prototype to allow further development with website analytics. Conclusions We report the development of Health for All, a website designed to enhance racial/ethnic minority participation in clinical trials by imparting research literacy, mitigating distrust engendered by longstanding racism and discrimination, and providing connections to clinical trials recruiting participants."

This is especially the case in the context of voice disorders, such as functional dysphonia (FD). We investigated 250 high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) recordings with simultaneously recorded acoustic signals (124 healthy females, 60 FD females, 44 healthy males, 22 FD males). 35 glottal area waveform (GAW) parameters and 14 acoustic parameters were calculated for each recording. Linear and non-linear relations between GAW and acoustic parameters were investigated using Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) and distance correlation coefficients (DCC). Further, norm values for parameters obtained from 250 ms long sustained phonation data (vowel /i/) were provided. 26 PCCs in females (5.3%) and 8 in males (1.6%) were found to be statistically significant (|corr.| ≥ 0.3). Only minor differences were found between PCCs and DCCs, indicating presence of weak non-linear dependencies between parameters. Fundamental frequency was involved in the majority of all relevant PCCs between GAW and acoustic parameters (19 in females and 7 in males). The most distinct difference between correlations in females and males was found for the parameter Period Variability Index . The study shows only weak relations between investigated acoustic and GAW-parameters. This indicates that the reduction of the complex 3D glottal dynamics to the 1D-GAW may erase laryngeal dynamic characteristics that are reflected within the acoustic signal. Hence, other GAW parameters, 2D-, 3D-laryngeal dynamics and vocal tract parameters should be further investigated towards potential correlations to the acoustic signal."

They could choose mucosectomy with electric scalpel (from May 2010) or self-administration of 5% imiquimod 3 times weekly for 16 weeks (from November 2013). A multivariate logistic regression model was developed for ≥HSIL-related factors using a step-wise approach to select variables, with a significance level of 0.05 for entry and 0.10 for exit, applying the Hosmer-Lemeshow test to assess the goodness of fit. Results The study included 405 patients with a mean age of 36.2 years; 56.7% had bachelor´s degree, and 52.8% were smokers. They had a mean of 1 (IQR 1–7) sexual partner in the previous 12 months, median time since HIV diagnosis of 2 years, and mean CD4 nadir of 367.9 cells/uL; 86.7% were receiving ART, the mean CD4 level was 689.6 cells/uL, mean CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.77, and 85.9% of patients were undetectable. Incidence rates were 30.86/1,000 patient-years for ≥high squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and 81.22/100,000 for anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC). The ≥HSIL incidence significantly decreased from 42.9% (9/21) in 2010 to 4.1% (10/254) in 2018 (p = 0.034). ≥HSIL risk factors were infection with HPV 11 (OR 3.81; 95%CI 1.76–8.24), HPV 16 (OR 2.69, 95%CI 1.22–5.99), HPV 18 (OR 2.73, 95%CI 1.01–7.36), HPV 53 (OR 2.97, 95%CI 1.002–8.79); HPV 61 (OR 11.88, 95%CI 3.67–38.53); HPV 68 (OR 2.44, CI 95% 1.03–5.8); low CD4 nadir (OR1.002; 95%CI 1–1.004) and history of AIDS (OR 2.373, CI 95% 1.009–5.577). Among HSIL-positive patients, the response rate was higher after imiquimod than after surgical excision (96.7% vs 73.3%, p = 0.009) and there were fewer re-treatments (2.7% vs 23.4%, p = 0.02) and adverse events (2.7% vs 100%, p = 0.046); none developed ASCC. Conclusions HSIL screening and treatment programs reduce the incidence of HSIL, which is related to chronic HPV infection and poor immunological status. Self-administration of 5% imiquimod as first-line treatment of HSIL is more effective than surgery in HIV+ MSM."
https://openalex.org/W3127174943,"This study was to compare the efficacy and safety of combined glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI) and ticagrelor versus ticagrelor in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). An observational study was conducted using the Improving Care for Cardiovascular Disease in China-ACS project. Totally, 13,264 patients with ACS and received combination therapy or ticagrelor therapy were analyzed. The primary outcome was the composite of major cardiovascular events (MACE: all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction [MI], stent thrombosis, cardiogenic shock, and ischemic stroke), and secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, MI, stent thrombosis, cardiogenic shock, and ischemic stroke. The multivariable adjusted analysis indicated that combination therapy was associated with an increased risk of major cardiovascular events (MACE) ( P = 0.001), any bleeding ( P &lt;0.001), and major bleeding ( P = 0.005). Moreover, the multivariable adjusted for propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis suggested that combination therapy produced additional risk of MACE ( P = 0.014), any bleeding ( P &lt;0.001), and major bleeding ( P = 0.005). Moreover, PSM analysis suggested that combination therapy was associated with greater risk of stent thrombosis ( P = 0.012) and intracranial bleeding ( P = 0.020). Combined GPI and ticagrelor therapies did not have any beneficial effects on MACE, stent thrombosis, intracranial bleeding, any bleeding, or major bleeding."
https://openalex.org/W3128474398,"Background Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is the most extreme and visible form of undernutrition plagued by chronic poverty, household food insecurity, lack of education. One of the indigenous and marginalized community of Nepal, Satar/Santhal has often been neglected and is devoid of good education and are economically deprived. This predisposes under 5 children of Satar into malnutrition. The study aims to assess determinants of SAM among children under 5 years of age in Satar community of Jhapa district, Nepal. Material &amp; methods A community based matched case control study was carried from September 2019 to February 2020 among under five children of Satar community residing in Jhapa district. Multistage random sampling technique was used to select 50 cases and 100 controls in the ratio of 1:2. Information was collected through personal interview with the parents and anthropometric measurement of the children was measured. Bivariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis was used to explore the determinants of severe acute malnutrition. Results A total of 664 children between the age group of 6–59 months were screened for SAM. The prevalence of SAM was found 7.53%. Factors like, low economic status, birth interval less than 2 years, frequency of breast feeding &lt;8 times/day and household food insecurity were found to be significant determinants of SAM. Multivariate logistic regression documented low economic status (AOR: 11.14, 95% CI 1.42 to 87.46); and frequency of breast feeding &lt;8 times/day (AOR: 2.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 4.37) as determinants of SAM. Conclusion Low economic status and frequency of breast feeding less than 8times/day were major determinants of SAM among children under 5yrs of age. Ending malnutrition will require greater efforts and integrated approaches to eradicate extreme poverty. Multi-sector approaches have been conducting for SAM in Nepal but there are no specific approaches for marginalized community."
https://openalex.org/W3126636358,"Background Respondent driven sampling (RDS) is employed to recruit populations that are hard-to-reach, “hidden,” or without a sampling frame. For new mothers (those with infants &lt;6 months) in countries without national health care systems or registries, there is no sampling frame, and random samples may only be attained through costly strategies, e.g., random-dial calling. Objective To assess the feasibility of RDS to recruit new mothers. Methods In the initial study, we recruited 30 new mothers (“seeds”) from a single birth hospital; each was given 3 referral coupons to give to other mothers (“referrals”). When our sample did not self-perpetuate with referrals, additional seeds were recruited. Demographics of seeds and referrals were compared. A subset of mothers participated in focus groups and were asked about their experience with RDS. We also conducted a second survey of new mothers to further assess feasibility of RDS in this population. Results Of the 402 mothers recruited in the initial study, 305 were seeds and only 97 were referrals. Referrals were more likely to be White, highly educated, older, and privately insured (all p≤0.001). Focus group participants indicated that the time required to meet other mothers was an important barrier. In the second survey we recruited 201 mothers; only 53.7% knew ≥1 mother whom they could invite to the study. Conclusions New mothers are not easily recruited using RDS because they have a limited number of contacts who are also new mothers. Those recruited through RDS are more likely to be older, Caucasian and of high socioeconomic status, indicating it is not an effective way to recruit a representative sample of new mothers."
https://openalex.org/W3127776941,"This paper adopts models from epidemiology to account for the development and decline of neologisms based on internet usage. The research design focuses on the issue of whether a host-driven epidemic model is well-suited to explain human behavior regarding neologisms. We extracted the search frequency data from Google Trends that covers the ninety most influential Chinese neologisms from 2008-2016 and found that the majority of them possess a similar rapidly rising-decaying pattern. The epidemic model is utilized to fit the evolution of these internet-based neologisms. The epidemic model not only has good fitting performance to model the pattern of rapid growth, but also is able to predict the peak point in the neologism’s life cycle. This result underlines the role of human agents in the life cycle of neologisms and supports the macro-theory that the evolution of human languages mirrors the biological evolution of human beings."
https://openalex.org/W3128654285,"Background Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease which causes health problem that affects more patients in the past few years. To be able to offer appropriate care, epidemiological analyses are crucial at the national level and its comparison with the international situation. Aim The demographic description of reported patients with parkinsonism (including Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonian syndromes) according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) from the national health registries. Methods Retrospective analysis of data available from the National Health Information System–NHIS and the National Registry of Reimbursed Health Services (NRRHS). Analyzed epidemiological data are intending to determine the regional and specific prevalence of Parkinsonism in the Czech Republic. The International Classification of Diseases diagnoses (ICD-10) of G20 (Parkinson’s disease—PD) and G23.1, G23.2, G23.3 (other degenerative disorders of basal ganglia), and G31.8 (another degenerative disease of basal ganglia) from the period of 2012 to 2018 were included into the analysis. Results We identified 78 453 unique patients from national registries in the period 2012 to 2018. Diagnoses of G20, G23.1, G23.2, and G31.8 were registered as the principal diagnoses in 76.6% of all individual patients. Conclusion We have found a growing number of patients coded with ICD-10 of dg. G20, G23.1, G23.2, G23.3, or G31.8 (N = 27 891 in 2012, and N = 30 612 in 2018). We have proven regional differences in the prevalence of Parkinson´s diagnoses. Therefore we assume most likely also differences in the care of patients with PD based on the availability of specialty care centers."
https://openalex.org/W3128940443,"Sociality is the tendency to spontaneously interact with others to establish and maintain relationships. Some approaches, including questionnaires, tests, controlled experiments, and qualitative field research, cannot capture complex social interactions, such as in children during nursery activities, because of problems with ecological validity and the labor cost of analysis. Here, we introduced a new methodology for the quantitative analysis of spontaneous social movement and investigated children’s group behavior using position data. We periodically visited a nursery and recorded videos of eurhythmics, in which children move in tune with music, in different classes. The results revealed that children in the six-year-old class approached others in a short period of time (within one second) and established group behavior like that in a game of tag. It can be interpreted that such social behavior may include actions related to the cognition of anticipating others’ behaviors in a complex situation. Although only a small amount of data could be acquired, this study suggests one of the characteristics of social behaviors in the classroom considering an ecological approach."
https://openalex.org/W3128318349,"Objectives This study aimed to describe HIV testing uptake, as well as HIV prevalence and its associated factors among older adults aged ≥50 years in health facilities in Togo. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out from February 2018 to June 2019 among hospitalized older adults aged ≥50 years in tertiary and secondary hospitals in Togo. HIV testing was performed according to the national algorithm. Socio-demographic data and HIV testing history were collected using a standardized questionnaire. Results A total of 619 patients (43.9% female) of median age 61 years, (IQR: 55–70) were recruited and offered HIV testing. Among them, 25.7% had never previously tested for HIV. In total, 91.6% (567/619) accepted HIV testing while 8.4% (52/619) refused to be tested. Of those who tested, forty patients were HIV positive, yielding a prevalence of 7.1%. Twenty-three patients (57.5%) were newly diagnosed with HIV infection. In multivariable analysis, two factors were associated with HIV infection: living alone (aOR = 5.83; 95%CI = [2.26–14.53]) and being &lt;60 years (aOR = 3.12; 95%CI = [1.51–6.66]). Conclusion The majority of older adults in this study accepted testing for HIV and almost three in five HIV positive older adults were newly diagnosed with HIV as a result of this testing. There is an urgent need to integrate older adults into responses to the HIV epidemic and to strengthen targeted prevention care and treatment in this population."
