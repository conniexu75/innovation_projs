https://openalex.org/W1995275031,"Whewellite and weddellite, calcium salts of oxalic acid, have been found in the litter layer of several different soils, indicating that oxalate is a major metabolic product of fungi in natural environments. The presence of oxalate in soil solution speeds weathering of soil minerals and increases the availability of nutrients to vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W2092259570,"The variations of the D/H and (18)O/(16)O ratios of nonexchangeable hydrogen and oxygen in plant cellulose reveal systematic differences between terrestrial plant groups. The slope of deltaD versus delta(18)O of cellulose from a variety of aquatic plants is close to 8 (the meteoric water value), while the slope for a number of terrestrial species is greater than or equal to about 24. Two models involving incorporation of CO(2) and H(2)O into cellulose precursors are proposed to account for these differences. Effects of evaporative transpiration on the isotopic composition of water in leaves are measured and discussed in the context of these models."
https://openalex.org/W2152890664,"Microstructural growth increments within the shells of numerous Recent and fossil molluscs are interpreted as reflections of alternating periods of shell deposition and dissolution, occurring during aerobic and anaerobic respiration, respectively. The acidic end products of anaerobic metabolism are neutralized by calcium carbonate from the shell, leaving a relatively insoluble organic residue at the mantle-shell interface. With the return of oxygenated conditions and resumption of aerobic respiration, this organic material is reincorporated within the shell. Inasmuch as metabolic changes are often synchronized with lunar or solar cycles (or both), we are led to the nearly paradoxical conclusion that, as a result of shell destructive processes, a relatively complete and detailed record of both short- and long-term growth is often preserved within the molluscan exoskeleton. Analyses of relationships between ambient oxygen concentrations and shell structural types may eventually prove useful, in paleoecological studies, for determination of dissolved oxygen gradients in Phanerozoic marine environments."
https://openalex.org/W1991188294,"The calculated energy efficiency of mass ejection for iron and anorthosite objects striking an anorthosite planet at speeds of 5 to 45 kilometers per second decreases with increasing impact velocity at low escape velocities. At escape velocities of >10(5) and >2 x 10(4) centimeters per second, respectively, the slower impactors produce relatively less ejecta for a given impact energy. The impact velocities at which ejecta losses equal meteorite mass gains are found to be approximately 20, 35, and 45 kilometers per second for anorthosite objects and approximately 25, 35, and 40 kilometers per second for iron objects striking anorthosite surfaces for the gravity fields of the moon, Mercury, and Mars."
https://openalex.org/W2137449474,A noncellular substance containing pollen and spores has been discovered protruding from the micropyle of a seed fern ovule of Middle Pennsylvanian age. This provides direct evidence that pollination-drop mechanisms comparable to those of many extant gymnosperms characterize some Paleozoic pteridosperms.
https://openalex.org/W2089320759,"The distribution of flavonoid compounds in Psilotum, Tmesipteris, and primitive filicalean ferns shows that it is unlikely the two groups are closely related. The Psilotaceae synthesize only amentoflavone and related biflavonyls which are totally absent from ferns. The primitive ferns contain the full complement of flavonols and proanthocyanidins, as found in all other filicalean families."

Whether the science is wrong because of clerical error, or because of poor technique, or because of incompetence, or because of negligence, is less important than the fact that it is wrong. For if it is wrong, and if the FDA did not know it was wrong, then the protective regulatory barrier between a potentially dangerous drug and the patient is removed.-SENATOR EDWARD KENNEDY (D-Mass.), in congressional hearings on preclinical testing."

https://openalex.org/W2020340912,"Oxygen isotopic analysis of the carbonate sediment fraction between 62 and 250 micrometers yields curves following the general trend of those obtained from Globigerinoides sacculifera. Warm stages 11, 13, and 15 are characterized by heavy postdepositional solution. which makes the sediment fraction between 62 and 250 micrometers rich in shell fragments of the more resistant, deeper-living species. As a result, oxygen isotopic analysis of these samples yields comparatively low temperatures, in contrast to those obtained from Globigerinoides sacculifera."
