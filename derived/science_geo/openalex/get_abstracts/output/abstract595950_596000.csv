https://openalex.org/W2952947531,"The challenge of linking intergenic mutations to target genes has limited molecular understanding of human diseases. Here we show that H3K27ac HiChIP generates high-resolution contact maps of active enhancers and target genes in rare primary human T cell subtypes and coronary artery smooth muscle cells. Differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 17 cells or regulatory T cells creates subtype-specific enhancer-promoter interactions, specifically at regions of shared DNA accessibility. These data provide a principled means of assigning molecular functions to autoimmune and cardiovascular disease risk variants, linking hundreds of noncoding variants to putative gene targets. Target genes identified with HiChIP are further supported by CRISPR interference and activation at linked enhancers, by the presence of expression quantitative trait loci, and by allele-specific enhancer loops in patient-derived primary cells. The majority of disease-associated enhancers contact genes beyond the nearest gene in the linear genome, leading to a fourfold increase in the number of potential target genes for autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2760454171,"Quantitative measurement of transcription rates in live cells is important for revealing mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. This is particularly challenging when measuring the activity of RNA polymerase III (Pol III), which transcribes growth-promoting small RNAs. To address this issue, we developed Corn, a genetically encoded fluorescent RNA reporter suitable for quantifying RNA transcription in cells. Corn binds and induces fluorescence of 3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene-imidazolinone-2-oxime, which resembles the fluorophore found in red fluorescent protein (RFP). Notably, Corn shows high photostability, enabling quantitative fluorescence imaging of mTOR-dependent Pol III transcription. We found that, unlike actinomycin D, mTOR inhibitors resulted in heterogeneous transcription suppression in individual cells. Quantitative imaging of Corn-tagged Pol III transcript levels revealed distinct Pol III transcription 'trajectories' elicited by mTOR inhibition. Together, these studies provide an approach for quantitative measurement of Pol III transcription by direct imaging of Pol III transcripts containing a photostable RNA-fluorophore complex."
https://openalex.org/W2760462427,"Loss of BAF47 destabilizes the BAF complex on chromatin, and reintroduction of BAF47 leads to enhancer activation and Polycomb opposition at bivalent promoters. BAF47 loss affects BAF and PBAF complexes, which have distinct functions in regulation of enhancers and promoters. Perturbations to mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF or BAF) complexes contribute to more than 20% of human cancers, with driving roles first identified in malignant rhabdoid tumor, an aggressive pediatric cancer characterized by biallelic inactivation of the core BAF complex subunit SMARCB1 (BAF47). However, the mechanism by which this alteration contributes to tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. We find that BAF47 loss destabilizes BAF complexes on chromatin, absent significant changes in complex assembly or integrity. Rescue of BAF47 in BAF47-deficient sarcoma cell lines results in increased genome-wide BAF complex occupancy, facilitating widespread enhancer activation and opposition of Polycomb-mediated repression at bivalent promoters. We demonstrate differential regulation by two distinct mSWI/SNF assemblies, BAF and PBAF complexes, enhancers and promoters, respectively, suggesting that each complex has distinct functions that are perturbed upon BAF47 loss. Our results demonstrate collaborative mechanisms of mSWI/SNF-mediated gene activation, identifying functions that are co-opted or abated to drive human cancers and developmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2758278098,"Atherosclerosis is universally recognized as a chronic lipid-induced inflammation of the vessel wall. Oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) drives the onset of atherogenesis involving macrophages and endothelial cells (ECs). Our earlier work showed that expression of long noncoding RNA-growth arrest-specific 5 (lncRNA GAS5) was significantly increased in the plaque of atherosclerosis collected from patients and animal models. In this study, we found that knockdown of lncRNA GAS5 reduced the apoptosis of THP-1 cells treated with oxLDL. On the contrary, overexpression of lncRNA GAS5 significantly elevated the apoptosis of THP-1 cells after oxLDL stimulation. The expressions of apoptotic factors including Caspases were changed with lncRNA GAS5 levels. Moreover, lncRNA GAS5 was found in THP-1 derived-exosomes after oxLDL stimulation. Exosomes derived from lncRNA GAS5-overexpressing THP-1 cells enhanced the apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells after taking up these exosomes. However, exosomes shed by lncRNA GAS5 knocked-down THP-1 cells inhibited the apoptosis of endothelial cells. These findings reveal the function of lncRNA GAS5 in atherogenesis which regulates the apoptosis of macrophages and endothelial cells via exosomes and suggest that suppressing the lncRNA GAS5 might be an effective way for the therapy of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2759456806,"A fundamental requirement for genetic studies is an accurate determination of sequence variation. While human genome sequence diversity is increasingly well characterized, there is a need for efficient ways to use this knowledge in sequence analysis. Here we present Graphtyper, a publicly available novel algorithm and software for discovering and genotyping sequence variants. Graphtyper realigns short-read sequence data to a pangenome, a variation-aware graph structure that encodes sequence variation within a population by representing possible haplotypes as graph paths. Our results show that Graphtyper is fast, highly scalable, and provides sensitive and accurate genotype calls. Graphtyper genotyped 89.4 million sequence variants in the whole genomes of 28,075 Icelanders using less than 100,000 CPU days, including detailed genotyping of six human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. We show that Graphtyper is a valuable tool in characterizing sequence variation in both small and population-scale sequencing studies."
https://openalex.org/W2759158289,"Corn, a 28-nucleotide RNA, increases yellow fluorescence of its cognate ligand 3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene-imidazolinone-2-oxime (DFHO) by >400-fold. Corn was selected in vitro to overcome limitations of other fluorogenic RNAs, particularly rapid photobleaching. We now report the Corn-DFHO co-crystal structure, discovering that the functional species is a quasisymmetric homodimer. Unusually, the dimer interface, in which six unpaired adenosines break overall two-fold symmetry, lacks any intermolecular base pairs. The homodimer encapsulates one DFHO at its interprotomer interface, sandwiching it with a G-quadruplex from each protomer. Corn and the green-fluorescent Spinach RNA are structurally unrelated. Their convergent use of G-quadruplexes underscores the usefulness of this motif for RNA-induced small-molecule fluorescence. The asymmetric dimer interface of Corn could provide a basis for the development of mutants that only fluoresce as heterodimers. Such variants would be analogous to Split GFP, and may be useful for analyzing RNA co-expression or association, or for designing self-assembling RNA nanostructures."
https://openalex.org/W2756577188,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have emerged as promising cancer therapeutics especially for tumors with deficient homologous recombination (HR) repair. However, as HR-deficient tumors represent only a small fraction of endometrial cancers, the therapeutic utility of PARP inhibitors is limited in this disease. Somatic loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a tumor suppressor that counteracts phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, is one of the most common genetic aberrations in endometrioid endometrial cancer. While previous works have identified the role of PTEN in DNA double-strand break repair, vulnerabilities of PTEN-deficient endometrioid endometrial cancers to PARP inhibition remain controversial. Here we find that PTEN-deficient endometrioid endometrial cancer cells are not responsive to PARP inhibitor Olaparib alone, but instead show superior sensitivity to compound inhibition with PI3K inhibitor BKM120, as evidenced by reduced clonogenic cell growth and three-dimensional (3D) spheroid disintegration. Mechanistically, PI3K blockade by BKM120 attenuated HR competency with γH2AX accumulation and reduced RAD51 and BRCA1 expression in Ishikawa, AN3CA and Nou-1 cells, but the same combination treatment led to enhanced phosphorylation of DNA-PK, a non-homologous end joining repair protein, in Hec-108 cells. Furthermore, we show that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated PTEN depletion rendered PTEN wild-type Hec-1A endometrioid endometrial cancer cells responsive to combined inhibition of PARP/PI3K, with concomitantly induced DNA damage accumulation and repair defects. The combination of BKM120 and Olaparib cooperated to inhibit tumor growth in a genetic mouse model of Pten-deficient endometrioid endometrial cancer. Together, these results suggest PI3K inhibition may be a plausible approach to expand the utility of PARP inhibitors to endometrioid endometrial cancers in a PTEN-deficient setting."
https://openalex.org/W2757999655,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide and characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the patients’ midbrains. Both the presence of the protein α-synuclein in intracellular protein aggregates in surviving neurons and the genetic linking of the α-synuclein encoding gene point towards a major role of α-synuclein in PD etiology. The exact pathogenic mechanisms of PD development are not entirely described to date, neither is the specific role of α-synuclein in this context. Previous studies indicate that one aspect of α-synuclein-related cellular toxicity might be direct proteasome impairment. The 20/26S proteasomal machinery is an important instrument of intracellular protein degradation. Thus, direct proteasome impairment by α-synuclein might explain or at least contribute to the formation of intracellular protein aggregates. Therefore this study investigates direct proteasomal impairment by α-synuclein both in vitro using recombinant α-synuclein and isolated proteasomes as well as in living cells. Our experiments demonstrate that the impairment of proteasome activity by α-synuclein is highly dependent upon the cellular background and origin. We show that recombinant α-synuclein oligomers and fibrils scarcely affect 20S proteasome function in vitro, neither does transient α-synuclein expression in U2OS ps 2042 (Ubi(G76V)-GFP) cells. However, stable expression of both wild-type and mutant α-synuclein in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells results in a prominent impairment of the chymotrypsin-like 20S/26S proteasomal protein cleavage. Thus, our results support the idea that α-synuclein in a specific cellular environment, potentially present in dopaminergic cells, cannot be processed by the proteasome and thus contributes to a selective vulnerability of dopaminergic cells to α-synuclein pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2756747062,"Lineage-tracing experiments in the mouse show that Lgr6, but not Lgr5, functions as a cancer stem marker in skin squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). The authors also show that Lgr6-knockout mice are predisposed to SCC development, through a mechanism that includes compensatory upregulation of Lgr5. The G-protein-coupled receptors LGR4, LGR5 and LGR6 are Wnt signaling mediators, but their functions in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are unclear. Using lineage tracing in Lgr5-EGFP-CreERT2/Rosa26-Tomato and Lgr6-EGFP-CreERT2/Rosa26-Tomato reporter mice, we demonstrate that Lgr6, but not Lgr5, acts as an epithelial stem cell marker in SCCs in vivo. We identify, by single-molecule in situ hybridization and cell sorting, rare cells positive for Lgr6 expression in immortalized keratinocytes and show that their frequency increases in advanced SCCs. Lgr6 expression is enriched in cells with stem cell characteristics, and Lgr6 downregulation in vivo causes increased epidermal proliferation with expanded lineage tracing from epidermal stem cells positive for Lgr6 expression. Surprisingly, mice with germline knockout of Lgr6 are predisposed to SCC development, through a mechanism that includes compensatory upregulation of Lgr5. These data provide a model for human patients with germline loss-of-function mutations in Wnt pathway genes, including RSPO1 or LGR4, who show increased susceptibility to squamous tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2757627545,"DNA methylation is one of the most important epigenetic modifications of eukaryotic genomes and is believed to play integral roles in diverse biological processes. Although DNA methylation has been well studied in mammals, data are limited in invertebrates, particularly Mollusca. The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is an emerging genetic model for functional analysis of DNA methylation in Mollusca. Recent studies have shown that there is a positive association between methylation status and gene expression in C. gigas; however, whether this association exists at the exon level remains to be determined.In this study, we characterized the genome-wide methylation pattern across two different tissues of C. gigas and found that methylated genes are expressed in more tissues and development stages than unmethylated genes. Furthermore, we found that different types of exons had different methylation levels, with the lowest methylation levels in the first exons, followed by the last exons, and the internal exons. We found that the exons included in the gene transcript contained significantly higher DNA methylation levels than skipped exons. We observed that the DNA methylation levels increased slowly after the start sites and end sites of exons seperately, and then decreased quickly towards the middle sites of exons. We also found that methylated exons were significantly longer than unmethylated exons.This study constitutes the first genome-wide analysis to show an association between exon-level DNA methylation and mRNA expression in the oyster. Our findings suggest that exon-level DNA methylation may play a role in the construction of alternative splicing by positively influencing exon inclusion during transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2760263671,"Background Early detection and diagnosis of tuberculosis remain major global priorities for tuberculosis control. Few studies have used a qualitative approach to investigate the social determinants contributing to diagnostic delay and none have compared data collected from individual, community, and health-system levels. We aimed to characterize the social determinants that contribute to diagnostic delay among persons diagnosed with tuberculosis living in resource-constrained settings. Methods/Principle findings Data were collected in public health facilities with high tuberculosis incidence in 19 districts of Lima, Peru. Semi-structured interviews with persons diagnosed with tuberculosis (n = 105) and their family members (n = 63) explored health-seeking behaviours, community perceptions of tuberculosis and socio-demographic circumstances. Focus groups (n = 6) were conducted with health personnel (n = 35) working in the National Tuberculosis Program. All interview data were transcribed and analysed using a grounded theory approach. The median delay between symptom onset and the public health facility visit that led to the first positive diagnostic sample was 57 days (interquartile range 28–126). The great majority of persons diagnosed with tuberculosis distrusted the public health system and sought care at public health facilities only after exhausting other options. It was universally agreed that persons diagnosed with tuberculosis faced discrimination by public and health personnel. Self-medication with medicines bought at local pharmacies was reported as the most common initial health-seeking behaviour due to the speed and low-cost of treatment in pharmacies. Most persons diagnosed with tuberculosis initially perceived their illness as a simple virus. Conclusions Diagnostic delay was common and prolonged. When individuals reached a threshold of symptom severity, they addressed their health with the least time-consuming, most economically feasible, and well-known healthcare option available to them. In high-burden settings, more human and material resources are required to promote tuberculosis case-finding initiatives, reduce tuberculosis associated stigma and address the social determinants underlying diagnostic delay."
https://openalex.org/W2757937798,"Direct interactions between pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members form the basis of cell death decision-making at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Here we report that three anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins (MCL-1, BCL-2 and BCL-XL) found untethered from the OMM function as transcriptional regulators of a prosurvival and growth program. Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins engage a BCL-2 homology (BH) domain sequence found in SUFU (suppressor of fused), a tumour suppressor and antagonist of the GLI DNA-binding proteins. BCL-2 proteins directly promote SUFU turnover, inhibit SUFU-GLI interaction, and induce the expression of the GLI target genes BCL-2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL. Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein/SUFU feedforward signalling promotes cancer cell survival and growth, and can be disabled with BH3 mimetics-small molecules that target anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins. Our findings delineate a chemical strategy for countering drug resistance in GLI-associated tumours and reveal unanticipated functions for BCL-2 proteins as transcriptional regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2757336401,"The GRAS gene family is a large plant-specific family of transcription factors that are involved in diverse processes during plant development. Medicago truncatula is an ideal model plant for genetic research in legumes, and specifically for studying nodulation, which is crucial for nitrogen fixation. In this study, 59 MtGRAS genes were identified and classified into eight distinct subgroups based on phylogenetic relationships. Motifs located in the C-termini were conserved across the subgroups, while motifs in the N-termini were subfamily specific. Gene duplication was the main evolutionary force for MtGRAS expansion, especially proliferation of the LISCL subgroup. Seventeen duplicated genes showed strong effects of purifying selection and diverse expression patterns, highlighting their functional importance and diversification after duplication. Thirty MtGRAS genes, including NSP1 and NSP2, were preferentially expressed in nodules, indicating possible roles in the process of nodulation. A transcriptome study, combined with gene expression analysis under different stress conditions, suggested potential functions of MtGRAS genes in various biological pathways and stress responses. Taken together, these comprehensive analyses provide basic information for understanding the potential functions of GRAS genes, and will facilitate further discovery of MtGRAS gene functions."
https://openalex.org/W2760585695,"Adverse experiences early in life impair cognitive function both in rodents and humans. In humans this increases the vulnerability to develop mental illnesses while in the rodent brain early life stress (ELS) abnormalities are associated with changes in synaptic plasticity, excitability and microstructure. Detailed information on the effects of ELS on rodent brain structural integrity at large and connectivity within the brain is currently lacking; this information is highly relevant for understanding the mechanism by which early life stress predisposes to mental illnesses. Here, we exposed rats to 24 hours of maternal deprivation (MD) at postnatal day 3, a paradigm known to increase corticosterone levels and thereby activate glucocorticoid receptors in the brain. Using structural magnetic resonance imaging we examined: i) volumetric changes and white/grey matter properties of the whole cerebrum and of specific brain areas; and ii) whether potential alterations could be normalized by blocking glucocorticoid receptors with mifepristone during the critical developmental window of early adolescence, i.e. between postnatal days 26 and 28. The results show that MD caused a volumetric reduction of the prefrontal cortex, particularly the ventromedial part, and the orbitofrontal cortex. Within the whole cerebrum, white (relative to grey) matter volume was decreased and region-specifically in prefrontal cortex and dorsomedial striatum following MD. A trend was found for the hippocampus. Grey matter fractions were not affected. Treatment with mifepristone did not normalize these changes. This study indicates that early life stress in rodents has long lasting consequences for the volume and structural integrity of the brain. However, changes were relatively modest and-unlike behavior- not mitigated by blockade of glucocorticoid receptors during a critical developmental period."
https://openalex.org/W2757312483,"Flavonoids secreted by legumes play a major role as signal molecules for attracting compatible rhizobia. The aim of this study was to assess and understand the diversity of microsymbionts nodulating Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea L. Verdc.) landraces of different seedcoat colours using restriction fragment length polymorphism and phylogenetic analysis. Seedcoat pigmentation of landraces had effect on the diversity of microsymbionts of Bambara groundnut. Even when planted together in one hole, nodulating bradyrhizobia clustered differently. For example, 16S rDNA-RFLP typing of rhizobial samples TUTVSBLM.I, TUTVSCRM.I and TUTVSRDM.I originating respectively from Black, Cream and Red landraces that were co-planted in the same hole at Manga in the Sudano-sahelian savanna, as well as TUTVSCRK.I and TUTVSRDK.I respectively from Cream and Red landraces co-planted at Kpalisogu in the Guinea savanna, revealed different 16S rDNA- RFLP types. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA, glnII, recA and atpD sequences showed that Vigna subterranea was nodulated specifically by a diverse group of Bradyrhizobium species (e.g. Bradyrhizobium vignae, and a novel group of Bradyrhizobium spp.) in soils from Ghana and South Africa. The recA gene phylogeny showed incongruency with the other housekeeping genes, indicating the possibility of lateral gene transfer and/or recombination events. The grouping of isolates according to symbiotic gene (nifH and nodD) phylogenies revealed inter- and intra-specific symbiotic plasmid transfer and different evolutionary history. The results also showed that a cropping history and physico-chemical environment of soils increased bradyrhizobial diversity in Ghana and South Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2758014048,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease associated with epigenetic dysregulation. 11q23 translocations involving the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1 (KMT2A) generate oncogenic fusion proteins with deregulated transcriptional potential. The polymerase-associated factor complex (PAFc) is an epigenetic co-activator complex that makes direct contact with MLL fusion proteins and is involved in AML, however, its functions are not well understood. Here, we explored the transcriptional targets regulated by the PAFc that facilitate leukemia by performing RNA-sequencing after conditional loss of the PAFc subunit Cdc73. We found Cdc73 promotes expression of an early hematopoietic progenitor gene program that prevents differentiation. Among the target genes, we confirmed the protein arginine methyltransferase Prmt5 is a direct target that is positively regulated by a transcriptional unit that includes the PAFc, MLL1, HOXA9 and STAT5 in leukemic cells. We observed reduced PRMT5-mediated H4R3me2s following excision of Cdc73 placing this histone modification downstream of the PAFc and revealing a novel mechanism between the PAFc and Prmt5. Knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of Prmt5 causes a G1 arrest and reduced proliferation resulting in extended leukemic disease latency in vivo. Overall, we demonstrate the PAFc regulates Prmt5 to facilitate leukemic progression and is a potential therapeutic target for AMLs."

The minimal detectable change (MDC) represents the least amount of change that indicates real difference (i.e., beyond random measurement error) for a single subject. Our aim was to investigate the test-retest reliability and MDC of the BDI-II and the TGDS in people with PD.Seventy patients were recruited from special clinics for movement disorders at a medical center. The patients' mean age was 67.7 years, and 63.0% of the patients were male. All patients were assessed with the BDI-II and the TGDS twice, 2 weeks apart. We used the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to determine the reliability between test and retest. We calculated the MDC based on standard error of measurement. The MDC% was calculated (i.e., by dividing the MDC by the possible maximal score of the measure).The test-retest reliabilities of the BDI-II/TGDS were high (ICC = 0.86/0.89). The MDCs (MDC%s) of the BDI-II and TGDS were 8.7 (13.8%) and 5.4 points (18.0%), respectively. Both measures had acceptable to nearly excellent random measurement errors.The test-retest reliabilities of the BDI-II and the TGDS are high. The MDCs of both measures are acceptable to nearly excellent in people with PD. These findings imply that the BDI-II and the TGDS are suitable for use in a research context and in clinical settings to detect real change in a single subject."

https://openalex.org/W2759721025,"The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) and Garvan Calculator have improved the individual prediction of fracture risk. However, additional bone measurements that might enhance the predictive ability of these tools are the subject of research. There is increasing interest in cortical parameters, especially cortical porosity. Neither FRAX nor Garvan include measurements of cortical architecture, important for bone strength, and providing independent information beyond the conventional approaches. We tested the hypothesis that cortical parameters are associated with fracture risk, independent of FRAX and Garvan estimates. This nested case-control study included 211 postmenopausal women aged 54-94 years with nonvertebral fractures, and 232 controls from the Tromsø Study in Norway. We assessed FRAX and Garvan 10-year risk estimates for fragility fracture, and quantified femoral subtrochanteric cortical porosity, thickness, and area from computed tomography images using StrAx1.0 software. Per standard deviation higher cortical porosity, thinner cortices, and smaller cortical area, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for fracture was 1.71 (1.38-2.11), 1.79 (1.44-2.23), and 1.52 (1.19-1.95), respectively. Cortical porosity and thickness, but not area, remained associated with fracture when adjusted for FRAX and Garvan estimates. Adding cortical porosity and thickness to FRAX or Garvan resulted in greater area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. When using cortical porosity (>80th percentile) or cortical thickness (<20th percentile) combined with FRAX (threshold >20%), 45.5% and 42.7% of fracture cases were identified, respectively. Using the same cutoffs for cortical porosity or thickness combined with Garvan (threshold >25%), 51.2% and 48.3% were identified, respectively. Specificity for all combinations ranged from 81.0-83.6%. Measurement of cortical porosity or thickness identified 20.4% and 17.5% additional fracture cases that, were unidentified using FRAX alone, and 16.6% and 13.7% fracture cases unidentified using Garvan alone. In conclusion, cortical parameters may help to improve identification of women at risk for fracture."
https://openalex.org/W2756786004,"Multi-stakeholder environmental management and governance processes are essential to realize social and ecological outcomes. Participation, collaboration, and learning are emphasized in these processes; to gain insights into how they influence stakeholders’ evaluations of outcomes in relation to management and governance interventions we use a path analysis approach to examine their relationships in individuals in four UNESCO Biosphere Reserves. We confirm a model showing that participation in more activities leads to greater ratings of process, and in turn, better evaluations of outcomes. We show the effects of participation in activities on evaluation of outcomes appear to be driven by learning more than collaboration. Original insights are offered as to how the evaluations of outcomes by stakeholders are shaped by their participation in activities and their experiences in management and governance processes. Understanding stakeholder perceptions about the processes in which they are involved and their evaluation of outcomes is imperative, and influences current and future levels of engagement. As such, the evaluation of outcomes themselves are an important tangible product from initiatives. Our research contributes to a future research agenda aimed at better understanding these pathways and their implications for engagement in stewardship and ultimately social and ecological outcomes, and to developing recommendations for practitioners engaged in environmental management and governance."

https://openalex.org/W2758568440,"The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) mediates the biological actions of IGF1 and IGF2. The IGF1R is involved in both physiological and pathological activities and is usually overexpressed in most types of cancer. In addition to its classical mechanism of action, recent evidence has shown a nuclear presence of IGF1R, associated with novel genomic/transcriptional types of activities. The present study was aimed at evaluating the hypothesis that nuclear IGF1R localization is not restricted to cancer cells and might constitute a novel physiologically relevant regulatory mechanism. Our data shows that nuclear translocation takes place in a wide array of cells, including normal diploid fibroblasts. In addition, we provide evidence for a synergistic effect of a nuclear translocation blocker along with selective IGF1R inhibitors in terms of decreasing cell proliferation. Given the important role of the IGF1R in mitogenesis, the present results may be of translational relevance in cancer research. In conclusion, results are consistent with the concept that nuclear IGF1R fulfills important physiological and pathological roles."
https://openalex.org/W2758389516,"Evasion of forkhead box O (FOXO) family of longevity-related transcription factors-mediated growth suppression is necessary to promote cancer development. Since somatic alterations or mutations and transcriptional dysregulation of the FOXO genes are infrequent in human cancers, it remains unclear how these tumour suppressors are eliminated from cancer cells. The protein stability of FOXO3A is regulated by Casein Kinase 1 alpha (CK1α) in an oncogenic RAS-specific manner, but whether this mode of regulation extends to related FOXO family members is unknown. Here we report that CK1α similarly destabilizes FOXO4 in RAS-mutant cells by phosphorylation at serines 265/268. The CK1α-dependent phosphoregulation of FOXO4 is primed, in part, by the PI3K/AKT effector axis of oncogenic RAS signalling. In addition, mutant RAS coordinately elevates proteasome subunit expression and proteolytic activity to eradicate nuclear FOXO4 proteins from RAS-mutant cancer cells. Importantly, dual inhibition of CK1α and the proteasome synergistically inhibited the growth of multiple RAS-mutant human cancer cell lines of diverse tissue origin by blockade of nuclear FOXO4 degradation and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Our findings challenge the current paradigm that nuclear export regulates the proteolysis of FOXO3A/4 tumour suppressors in the context of cancer and illustrates how oncogenic RAS-mediated degradation of FOXOs, via post-translational mechanisms, blocks these important tumour suppressors."
https://openalex.org/W2759484650,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute novel biomarkers for various diseases. Accurate and quantitative analysis of miRNA expression is critical for biomedical research and clinical theranostics. In this study, a method was developed for sensitive and specific detection of miRNAs via dual signal amplification based on duplex specific nuclease (DSN) and hybridization chain reaction (HCR). A reporter probe (RP), comprising recognition sequence (3' end modified with biotin) for a target miRNA of miR-21 and capture sequence (5' end modified with Fam) for HCR product, was designed and synthesized. HCR was initiated by partial sequence of initiator probe (IP), the other part of which can hybridize with capture sequence of RP, and was assembled by hairpin probes modified with biotin (H1-bio and H2-bio). A miR-21 triggered cyclical DSN cleavage of RP, which was immobilized to a streptavidin (SA) coated magnetic bead (MB). The released Fam labeled capture sequence then hybridized with the HCR product to generate a detectable dsDNA. This polymer was then dropped on lateral flow strip and positive result was observed. The proposed method allowed quantitative sequence-specific detection of miR-21 (with a detection limit of 2.1 fM, S/N = 3) in a dynamic range from 100 fM to 100 pM, with an excellent ability to discriminate differences in miRNAs. The method showed acceptable testing recoveries for the determination of miRNAs in serum."
https://openalex.org/W2759667583,"The chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and 7 (CXCR7) are G-protein-coupled receptors involved in various diseases including human cancer. As such, they have become important targets for therapeutic intervention. Cell-based receptor assays, able to detect agents that modulate receptor activity, are of key importance for drug discovery. We evaluated the potential of cellular electric impedance for this purpose. Dose-dependent and specific stimulation of CXCR4 was detected upon addition of its unique chemokine ligand CXCL12. The response magnitude correlated with the CXCR4 expression level. Gαi coupling and signaling contributed extensively to the impedance response, whereas Gαq- and Gβγ-related events had only minor effects on the impedance profile. CXCR7 signaling could not be detected using impedance measurements. However, increasing levels of CXCR7 expression significantly reduced the CXCR4-mediated impedance readout, suggesting a regulatory role for CXCR7 on CXCR4-mediated signaling. Taken together, cellular electric impedance spectroscopy can represent a valuable alternative pharmacological cell-based assay for the identification of molecules targeting CXCR4, but not for CXCR7 in the absence of CXCR4."
https://openalex.org/W2760279547,"Background Complicated malaria remains an important public health problem, particularly in endemic settings where access to health services is limited and consequently malaria fatal outcomes occur. Few publications describing the clinical course and outcomes of complicated malaria in Latin America are found in the literature. This prospective study approached the clinical and laboratory characteristics of hospitalized patients with complicated malaria in different endemic areas of the Colombian Pacific Coast with the aim to provide epidemiological knowledge and guide to further reducing malaria severity and mortality. Methods and findings A prospective, descriptive hospital-based study was conducted in 323 complicated malaria patients (median age 20 years) enrolled in Quibdó, Tumaco and Cali between 2014 and 2016. Clinical evaluation was performed and laboratory parameters were assessed during hospitalization. Plasmodium falciparum was the most common parasite species (70%), followed by P. vivax (28%), and mixed malaria (Pf/Pv; 1.9%). Overall, predominant laboratory complications were severe thrombocytopenia (43%), hepatic dysfunction (40%), and severe anaemia (34%). Severe thrombocytopenia was more common in adults (52%) regardless of parasite species. Severe anaemia was the most frequent complication in children ≤10 years (72%) and was most commonly related to P. vivax infection (p < 0.001); whereas liver dysfunction was more frequent in older patients (54%) with P. falciparum (p < 0.001). Two deaths due to P. vivax and P. falciparum each were registered. Treatment provision before recruitment hindered qPCR confirmation of parasite species in some cases. Conclusions The study identified a high prevalence of complicated malaria in the Pacific Coast, together with more frequent severe anaemia in children infected by P. vivax and hepatic dysfunction in adults with P. falciparum. Results indicated the need for earlier diagnosis and treatment to prevent complications development as well as more effective attention at hospital level, in order to rapidly identify and appropriately treat these severe clinical conditions. The study describes epidemiological profiles of the study region and identified the most common complications on which clinicians must focus on to prevent mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2759932527,"Australia and New Zealand share the highest incidence rates of melanoma worldwide. Despite the substantial increase in public and physician awareness of melanoma in Australia over the last 30 years–as a result of the introduction of publicly funded mass media campaigns that began in the early 1980s –mortality has steadily increased during this period. This increased mortality has led investigators to question the relative merits of primary versus secondary prevention; that is, sensible sun exposure practices versus early detection. Increased melanoma vigilance on the part of the public and among physicians has resulted in large increases in public health expenditure, primarily from screening costs and increased rates of office surgery. Has this attempt at secondary prevention been effective? Unfortunately epidemiologic studies addressing the causal relationship between the level of secondary prevention and mortality are prohibitively difficult to implement–it is currently unknown whether increased melanoma surveillance reduces mortality, and if so, whether such an approach is cost-effective. Here I address the issue of secondary prevention of melanoma with respect to incidence and mortality (and cost per life saved) by developing a Markov model of melanoma epidemiology based on Australian incidence and mortality data. The advantages of developing a methodology that can determine constraint-based surveillance outcomes are twofold: first, it can address the issue of effectiveness; and second, it can quantify the trade-off between cost and utilisation of medical resources on one hand, and reduced morbidity and lives saved on the other. With respect to melanoma, implementing the model facilitates the quantitative determination of the relative effectiveness and trade-offs associated with different levels of secondary and tertiary prevention, both retrospectively and prospectively. For example, I show that the surveillance enhancement that began in 1982 has resulted in greater diagnostic incidence and reduced mortality, but the reduced mortality carried a significant cost per life saved. I implement the model out to 2028 and demonstrate that the enhanced secondary prevention that began in 1982 becomes increasingly cost-effective over the period 2013–2028. On the other hand, I show that reductions in mortality achieved by significantly enhancing secondary prevention beyond 2013 levels are comparable with those achieved by only modest improvements in late-stage disease survival. Given the ballooning costs of increased melanoma surveillance, I suggest the process of public health policy decision-making–particularly with respect to the public funding of melanoma screening and discretionary mole removal–would be better served by incorporating the results of quantitative modelling."
https://openalex.org/W2757328518,"C5-substituted 2,4-diaminoquinazoline inhibitors of the decapping scavenger enzyme DcpS (DAQ-DcpSi) have been developed for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is caused by genetic deficiency in the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein. These compounds are claimed to act as SMN2 transcriptional activators but data underlying that claim are equivocal. In addition it is unclear whether the claimed effects on SMN2 are a direct consequence of DcpS inhibitor or might be a consequence of lysosomotropism, which is known to be neuroprotective. DAQ-DcpSi effects were characterized in cells in vitro utilizing DcpS knockdown and 7-methyl analogues as probes for DcpS vs non-DcpS-mediated effects. We also performed analysis of Smn transcript levels, RNA-Seq analysis of the transcriptome and SMN protein in order to identify affected pathways underlying the therapeutic effect, and studied lysosomotropic and non-lysosomotropic DAQ-DCpSi effects in 2B/- SMA mice. Treatment of cells caused modest and transient SMN2 mRNA increases with either no change or a decrease in SMNΔ7 and no change in SMN1 transcripts or SMN protein. RNA-Seq analysis of DAQ-DcpSi-treated N2a cells revealed significant changes in expression (both up and down) of approximately 2,000 genes across a broad range of pathways. Treatment of 2B/- SMA mice with both lysomotropic and non-lysosomotropic DAQ-DcpSi compounds had similar effects on disease phenotype indicating that the therapeutic mechanism of action is not a consequence of lysosomotropism. In striking contrast to the findings in vitro, Smn transcripts were robustly changed in tissues but there was no increase in SMN protein levels in spinal cord. We conclude that DAQ-DcpSi have reproducible benefit in SMA mice and a broad spectrum of biological effects in vitro and in vivo, but these are complex, context specific, and not the result of simple SMN2 transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W2758236225,"Introduction 
Plasmodium falciparum induced antibodies are key components of anti-malarial immunity in malaria endemic areas, but their antigen targets can be polymorphic. Induction of a high proportion of strain-specific antibodies will limit the recognition of a broad diversity of parasite strains by these responses. There are indications that circulating parasite diversity varies with malaria transmission intensity, and this may affect the specificity of elicited anti-malarial antibodies. This study therefore assessed the effect of varying malaria transmission patterns on the specificity of elicited antibody responses and to identify possible antibody correlates of naturally acquired immunity to malaria in children in an area of Ghana with seasonal malaria transmission.


Methods 
This retrospective study utilized plasma samples collected longitudinally at six time points from children aged one to five years. Multiplex assays were used to measure antibody levels against four P. falciparum AMA 1 variants (from the 3D7, FVO, HB3 and CAMP parasite strains) and the 3D7 variant of the EBA 175 region II antigen and the levels compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic children. The relative proportions of cross-reactive and strain-specific antibodies against the four AMA 1 variants per sampling time point were assessed by Bland-Altman plots. The levels of antibodies against allelic AMA1 variants, measured by singleplex and multiplex luminex assays, were also compared.


Results 
The data show that increased transmission intensity is associated with higher levels of cross-reactive antibody responses, most likely a result of a greater proportion of multiple parasite clone infections during the high transmission period. Anti-AMA1 antibodies were however associated with a history of infection rather than protection in this age group.


Conclusion 
The data contribute to understanding the underlying mechanism of the acquisition of strain-transcending antibody immunity following repeated exposure to diverse parasite strains."
https://openalex.org/W2759311891,"Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is an extremely rare metastatic soft tissue tumor with a poor prognosis for which no effective systemic therapies have yet been established. Therefore, the development of novel effective treatment approaches is required. Tyrosine kinases (TKs) are being increasingly used as therapeutic targets in a variety of cancers. The purpose of this study was to identify novel therapeutic target TKs and to clarify the efficacy of TK inhibitors (TKIs) in the treatment of ASPS.To identify novel therapeutic target TKs in ASPS, we evaluated the antitumor effects and kinase activity of three TKIs (pazopanib, dasatinib, and cabozantinib) against ASPS cells using an in vitro assay. Based on these results, we then investigated the phosphorylation activities of the identified targets using western blotting, in addition to examining antitumor activity through in vivo assays of several TKIs to determine both the efficacy of these substances and accurate targets.In cell proliferation and invasion assays using pazopanib, cabozantinib, and dasatinib, all three TKIs inhibited the cell growth in ASPS cells. Statistical analyses of the cell proliferation and invasion assays revealed that dasatinib had a significant inhibitory effect in cell proliferation assays, and cabozantinib exhibited marked inhibitory effects on cellular functions in both assays. Through western blotting, we also confirmed that cabozantinib inhibited c-MET phosphorylation and dasatinib inhibited SRC phosphorylation in dose-dependent fashion. Mice that received cabozantinib and dasatinib had significantly smaller tumor volumes than control animals, demonstrating the in vivo antitumor activity of, these substances.Our findings suggest that cabozantinib and dasatinib may be more effective than pazopanib against ASPS cells. These in vitro and in vivo data suggest that c-MET may be a potential therapeutic target in ASPS, and cabozantinib may be a particularly useful therapeutic option for patients with ASPS, including those with pazopanib-resistant ASPS."
https://openalex.org/W2759779045,"The analysis of Pleurotus ostreatus genome reveals the presence of automatically annotated 53 lipase and 34 carboxylesterase putative coding-genes. Since no biochemical or physiological data are available so far, a functional approach was applied to identify lipases from P. ostreatus. In the tested growth conditions, four lipases were found expressed, with different patterns depending on the used C source. Two of the four identified proteins (PleoLip241 and PleoLip369), expressed in both analysed conditions, were chosen for further studies, such as an in silico analysis and their molecular characterization. To overcome limits linked to native production, a recombinant expression approach in the yeast Pichia pastoris was applied. Different expression levels were obtained: PleoLip241 reached a maximum activity of 4000 U/L, whereas PleoLip369 reached a maximum activity of 700 U/L. Despite their sequence similarity, these enzymes exhibited different substrate specificity and diverse stability at pH, temperature, and presence of metals, detergents and organic solvents. The obtained data allowed classifying PleoLip241 as belonging to the ""true lipase"" family. Indeed, by phylogenetic analysis the two proteins fall in different clusters. PleoLip241 was used to remove the hydrophobic layer from wool surface in order to improve its dyeability. The encouraging results obtained with lipase treated wool led to forecast PleoLip241 applicability in this field."
https://openalex.org/W2757591793,"The relatively high imaging speed of EPI has led to its widespread use in dynamic MRI studies such as functional MRI. An approach to improve the performance of EPI, EPI with Keyhole (EPIK), has been previously presented and its use in fMRI was verified at 1.5T as well as 3T. The method has been proven to achieve a higher temporal resolution and smaller image distortions when compared to single-shot EPI. Furthermore, the performance of EPIK in the detection of functional signals was shown to be comparable to that of EPI. For these reasons, we were motivated to employ EPIK here for high-resolution imaging. The method was optimised to offer the highest possible in-plane resolution and slice coverage under the given imaging constraints: fixed TR/TE, FOV and acceleration factors for parallel imaging and partial Fourier techniques. The performance of EPIK was evaluated in direct comparison to the optimised protocol obtained from EPI. The two imaging methods were applied to visual fMRI experiments involving sixteen subjects. The results showed that enhanced spatial resolution with a whole-brain coverage was achieved by EPIK (1.00 mm × 1.00 mm; 32 slices) when compared to EPI (1.25 mm × 1.25 mm; 28 slices). As a consequence, enhanced characterisation of functional areas has been demonstrated in EPIK particularly for relatively small brain regions such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and superior colliculus (SC); overall, a significantly increased t-value and activation area were observed from EPIK data. Lastly, the use of EPIK for fMRI was validated with the simulation of different types of data reconstruction methods."

Russian Federation, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and China are the main natural distribution areas of A. mongholicus in the world. However, the quality of medicinal plant varies among different locations. As for A. mongholicus, limited literature focused on its biodiversity mechanism. Here, we combined the chemometric analysis of chemical components with genetic variation, as well as climatic and edaphic traits, to reveal the biodiversity mechanism of A. mongholicus. Results showed that the detected chemical, genetic and climatic traits comprehensively contributed to the quality diversity of A. mongholicus. The eight main chemical components, as well as the inorganic elements of P, B and Na were all significant chemical factors. The precipitation and sunshine duration were the main distinguishing climatic factors. The inorganic elements As, Mn, P, Se and Pb were the distinguishing edaphic factors. The systematic method was firstly established for this medicinal plant in order to illustrate the formation of diversity in terms of quality, and provide scientific evidence for geographic indications and climatic adaptation in production and in the clinical application of herbal medicinal plants."
https://openalex.org/W2758787877,"We present first evidence showing that some electrophoretically homogeneous IgGs from the sera of patients with schizophrenia (36.4%) and their Fab and F(ab)2 fragments as well as from healthy donors (33.3%) possess catalase activity. The relative catalase activity of IgGs from the sera of individual schizophrenia patients (and healthy donors) significantly varied from patient to patient, but the activity of IgGs from healthy donors is on average 15.8-fold lower than that for schizophrenia patients. After extensive dialysis of purified IgGs against EDTA chelating metal ions, the relative catalase activity of IgGs decreases on average approximately 2.5-3.7-fold; all IgGs possess metal-dependent and independent catalase activity. The addition of external Me2+ ions to dialyzed and non-dialyzed IgGs leads to a significant increase in their activity. The best activator of dialyzed and non-dialyzed IgGs is Co2+, the activation by Cu2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+ ions were rare and always lower than by Co2+. Every IgG preparation demonstrates several individual sets of very well expressed pH optima in the pH range from 4.0 to 9.5. These data speak for the individual repertoire of catalase IgGs in every person and an extreme diversity of abzymes in their pH optima and activation by different metal ions. It is known that antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutases, catalases, and glutathione peroxidases represent critical defense mechanisms preventing oxidative modifications of DNA, proteins, and lipids. Catalase activity of human IgGs could probably also play a major role in the protection of organisms from oxidative stress and toxic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2759030836,"Laterality is a well described phenomenon in domestic dogs. It was shown that dogs, under calm Earth's magnetic field conditions, when marking their home ranges, tend to head about north- or southwards and display thus magnetic alignment. The question arises whether magnetic alignment might be affected or even compromised by laterality and vice versa. We tested the preference of dogs to choose between two dishes with snacks that were placed left and right, in different compass directions (north and east, east and south, south and west or west and north) in front of them. Some dogs were right-lateral, some left-lateral but most of them were ambilateral. There was a preference for the dish placed north compared to the one placed east of the dog (""pull of the north""). This effect was highly significant in small and medium-sized breeds but not in larger breeds, highly significant in females, in older dogs, in lateralized dogs but less significant or not significant in males, younger dogs, or ambilateral dogs. Laterality and “pull of the north” are phenomena which should be considered in diverse tasks and behavioral tests with which dogs or other animals might be confronted. The interaction and possible conflict between lateralization and ""pull of the north"" might be also considered as a reason for shifted magnetic alignment observed in different animal species in different contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2759283181,"Introduction The objective of this study was to identify prenatal markers of histological chorioamnionitis (HC) during pPROM using fetal computerized cardiotocography (cCTG). Materials and methods Retrospective review of medical records from pregnant women referred for pPROM between 26 and 34 weeks, in whom placental histology was available, in a tertiary level obstetric service over a 5-year period. Fetal heart rate variability was assessed using cCTG. Patients were included if they were monitored at least six times in the 72 hours preceding delivery. Clinical and biological cCTG parameters during the pPROM latency period were compared between cases with or without HC. Results In total, 222 pPROM cases were observed, but cCTG data was available in only 23 of these cases (10 with and 13 without HC) after exclusion of co-morbidities which may potentially perturb fetal heart rate variability measures. Groups were comparable for maternal age, parity, gestational age at pPROM, pPROM duration and neonatal characteristics (p>0.1). Baseline fetal heart rate was higher in the HC group [median 147.3 bpm IQR (144.2–149.2) vs. 141.3 bpm (137.1–145.4) in no HC group; p = 0.02]. The number of low variation episodes [6.4, (3.5–15.3) vs. 2.3 (1–5.2); p = 0.04] was also higher in the HC group, whereas short term variations were lower in the HC group [7.1 ms (6–7.4) vs. 8.1 ms (7.4–9); p = 0.01] within 72 hours before delivery. Differences were especially discriminant within 24 hours before delivery, with less short-term variation [5 ms (3.7–5.9) vs. 7.8 ms (5.4–8.7); p = 0.007] and high variation episodes [3.9 (4.9–3.2) vs. 0.8 (1.5–0.2); p < 0.001] in the HC group. Conclusion These results show differences in fetal heart rate variability, suggesting that cCTG could be used clinically to diagnoses chorioamnionitis during the pPROM latency period."
https://openalex.org/W2756509828,"Alkaline/neutral invertases (A/N-Inv), glucosidases that irreversibly hydrolyze sucrose into glucose and fructose, play significant roles in plant growth, development, and stress adaptation. They occur as multiple isoforms located in the cytosol or organelles. In Arabidopsis thaliana, two mitochondrial A/N-Inv genes (A/N-InvA and A/N-InvC) have already been investigated. In this study, we functionally characterized A/N-InvH, a third Arabidopsis gene coding for a mitochondrial-targeted protein. The phenotypic analysis of knockout mutant plants (invh) showed a severely reduced shoot growth, while root development was not affected. The emergence of the first floral bud and the opening of the first flower were the most affected stages, presenting a significant delay. A/N-InvH transcription is markedly active in reproductive tissues. It is also expressed in the elongation and apical meristem root zones. Our results show that A/N-InvH expression is not evident in photosynthetic tissues, despite being of relevance in developmental processes and mitochondrial functional status. NaCl and mannitol treatments increased A/N-InvH expression twofold in the columella root cap. Moreover, the absence of A/N-InvH prevented ROS formation, not only in invh roots of salt- and ABA-treated seedlings but also in invh control roots. We hypothesize that this isoform may take part in the ROS/sugar (sucrose or its hydrolysis products) signaling pathway network, involved in reproductive tissue development, cell elongation, and abiotic stress responses."

We characterized ZEB1 expression at single cell level in 266 primary brain tumors and present a comprehensive dataset of high grade gliomas with Ki67, p53, IDH1, and EGFR immunohistochemistry, as well as EGFR FISH. ZEB1 protein expression in glioma stem cell lines was compared to their parental tumors with respect to gene expression subtypes based on RNA-seq transcriptomic profiles. ZEB1 is widely expressed in glial tumors, but in a highly variable fraction of cells. In glioblastoma, ZEB1 labeling index is higher in tumors with EGFR amplification or IDH1 mutation. Co-labeling studies showed that tumor cells and reactive astroglia, but not immune cells contribute to the ZEB1 positive population. In contrast, glioma cell lines constitutively express ZEB1 irrespective of gene expression subtype. In conclusion, our data indicate that immune infiltration likely contributes to differential labelling of ZEB1 and confounds interpretation of bulk ZEB1 expression data."
https://openalex.org/W2757270231,"The determination of trace rare-earth elements (REEs) can be used for the assessment of environmental pollution, and is of great significance to the study of toxicity and toxicology in animals and plants. N, N, N′, N′-tetraoctyl diglycolamide (TODGA) is an environmental friendly extractant that is highly selective to REEs. In this study, an analytical method was developed for the simultaneous determination of 16 trace REEs in simulated water samples by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). With this method, TODGA was used as the extractant to perform the liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) sample pretreatment procedure. All 16 REEs were extracted from a 3 M nitric acid medium into an organic phase by a 0.025 M TODGA petroleum ether solution. A 0.03 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA) solution was used for back-extraction to strip the REEs from the organic phase into the aqueous phase. The aqueous phase was concentrated using a vacuum rotary evaporator and the concentration of the 16 REEs was detected by ICP-OES. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the limits of detection (3σ, n = 7) for the REEs ranged from 0.0405 ng mL-1 (Nd) to 0.5038 ng mL-1 (Ho). The relative standard deviations (c = 100 ng mL-1, n = 7) were from 0.5% (Eu) to 4.0% (Tm) with a linear range of 4–1000 ng mL-1 (R2 > 0.999). The recoveries of 16 REEs ranged from 95% to 106%. The LLE-ICP-OES method established in this study has the advantages of simple operation, low detection limits, fast analysis speed and the ability to simultaneously determine 16 REEs, thereby acting as a viable alternative for the simultaneous detection of trace amounts of REEs in water samples."
https://openalex.org/W2758720476,"Circuity, defined as the ratio of the shortest network distance to the Euclidean distance between one origin-destination (O-D) pair, can be adopted as a helpful evaluation method of indirect degrees of train paths. In this paper, the maximum circuity of the paths of operated trains is set to be the threshold value of the circuity of high-speed train paths. For the shortest paths of any node pairs, if their circuity is not higher than the threshold value, the paths can be regarded as the reasonable paths. With the consideration of a certain relative or absolute error, we cluster the reasonable paths on the basis of their inclusion relationship and the center path of each class represents a passenger transit corridor. We take the high-speed rail (HSR) network in China at the end of 2014 as an example, and obtain 51 passenger transit corridors, which are alternative sets of train paths. Furthermore, we analyze the circuity distribution of paths of all node pairs in the network. We find that the high circuity of train paths can be decreased with the construction of a high-speed railway line, which indicates that the structure of the HSR network in China tends to be more complete and the HSR network can make the Chinese railway network more efficient."
https://openalex.org/W2760594638,"A newly developed head-mounted perimeter termed ""imo"" enables visual field (VF) testing without a fixed head position. Because the positional relationship between the subject's head and the imo is fixed, the effects of head position changes on the test results are small compared with those obtained using a stationary perimeter. However, only ocular counter-roll (OCR) induced by head tilt might affect VF testing. To quantitatively reveal the effects of head tilt and OCR on the VF test results, we investigated the associations among the head-tilt angle, OCR amplitude and VF testing results.For 20 healthy subjects, we binocularly recorded static OCR (s-OCR) while tilting the subject's head at an arbitrary angle ranging from 0° to 60° rightward or leftward in 10° increments. By monitoring iris patterns, we evaluated the s-OCR amplitude. We also performed blind spot detection while tilting the subject's head by an arbitrary angle ranging from 0° to 50° rightward or leftward in 10° increments to calculate the angle by which the blind spot rotates because of head tilt.The association between s-OCR amplitude and head-tilt angle showed a sinusoidal relationship. In blind spot detection, the blind spot rotated to the opposite direction of the head tilt, and the association between the rotation angle of the blind spot and the head-tilt angle also showed a sinusoidal relationship. The rotation angle of the blind spot was strongly correlated with the s-OCR amplitude (R2≥0.94, p<0.0001). A head tilt greater than 20° with imo causes interference between adjacent test areas.Both the s-OCR amplitude and the rotation angle of the blind spot were correlated with the head-tilt angle by sinusoidal regression. The rotated VF was correlated with the s-OCR amplitude. During perimetry using imo, the change in the subject's head tilt should be limited to 20°."

Our objective was to perform a detailed survey of the molecular epidemiology of C. trachomatis in the population of Southampton UK attending the genitourinary medicine clinic (GUM) to seek evidence of sexual network activity. Our hypothesis was that certain genotypes can be associated with specific demographic determinants. 380 positive samples were collected from 375 C. trachomatis positive GUM attendees out of the 3118 who consented to be part of the survey. 302 of the positive samples were fully genotyped. All six of the predominant genotypes possessed ompA locus type E. One ward of Southampton known to contain a large proportion of students had a different profile of genotypes compared to other areas of the city. Some genotypes appeared embedded in the city population whilst others appeared transient. Predominant circulating genotypes remain stable within a city population whereas others are sporadic. Sexual networks could be inferred but not conclusively identified using the data from this survey.

Ferritin over-expression in BMSCs was determined by cell immunocytochemistry and the ferritin content in cells was determined by ELISA assay. BMSCs were subjected to cell viability, proliferation and multi-differentiation analyses as well as 7T MRI test using fast spin-echo pulse sequence. The R2 value andδR2 were calculated according to T2 mapping images.As was confirmed by cell immunocytochemistry and ELISA assay, rAdV mediated ferritin was over-expressed in BMSCs. Ferritin over-expression did not interfere with stem cell viability or pluripotent differentiation but slowed cell proliferation. The R2 value of BMSCs-FTH1 vs control BMSCs from 1-4 weeks was16.65±1.28 s-1 vs 13.99±0.80 s-1, (t = 3.94, p = 0.004), 15.63±1.37 s-1 vs 13.87±0.83 s-1 (t = 2.47, p = 0.039), 15.53±0.88 s-1 vs 14.25±0.53 s-1 (t = 2.80, p = 0.023) and 14.61±1.28 s-1 vs 13.69±1.03 s-1 (t = 1.25, p = 0.24), respectively. δR2 gradually decreased from 1-4 weeks and the difference between the groups had statistical significance (F = 12.45, p<0.01).δR2 was positively correlated with OD value (r = 0.876, p<0.01) and ferritin concentration (r = 0.899, p<0.01) as determined by Pearson correlation.Our study confirms that ferritin could be over-expressed in BMSCs as a result of rAdV mediated infection and could be quantitatively detected by 7T MRI device. The differences in T2 signal intensities and R2 values stem from internal contrast generated by endogenous ferritin over-expression. The correlation between δR2, OD and ferritin concentration suggests that MRI can detect ferritin signal change accurately."

Here, we examined the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism in the REG3A gene, rs7588571, which is located upstream and within 2 kb of the REG3A gene, and transplant outcomes including the incidence of GVHD. The study population consisted of 126 adult Japanese patients who had undergone bone marrow transplantation from a HLA-matched sibling. There was no association between rs7588571 polymorphism and the incidence of acute GVHD. However, a significantly higher incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was observed in patients with the rs7588571 non-GG genotype than in those with the GG genotype (Odds ratio 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-6.0; P = 0.029). Semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR demonstrated that the rs7588571 non-GG genotype exhibited a significantly lower REG3A mRNA expression level than the GG genotype (P = 0.032), and Western blot analysis demonstrated that the rs7588571 non-GG genotype exhibited a trend toward lower REG3A protein expression level than the GG genotype (P = 0.053). Since REG proteins have several activities that function to control intestinal microbiota, and since intestinal dysbiosis is in part responsible for the development of GVHD, our findings lead to the novel concept that REG3A could have some protective effect in the pathogenesis of GVHD through the regulation of gut microbiota."

NCKU-21-induced cell apoptosis was verified by Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) double-staining and measurement of caspase-3 activity. Western blotting and wound-healing assays were applied to respectively evaluate regulation of signaling pathways and cell migration by NCKU-21. Molecular interactions between target proteins and NCKU-21 were predicted and performed by molecular docking. A colorimetric screening assay kit was used to evaluate potential regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity by NCKU-21.Results indicated that NCKU-21 markedly induced cytotoxic effects that reduced cell viability via cell apoptosis in tested NSCLC cells. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p53 protein expression also increased in both NSCLC cell lines stimulated with NCKU-21. However, repression of PI3K-AKT activation by NCKU-21 was found in CL1-5 cells but not in A549 cells. In addition, increases in phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase-3 activity also confirmed the apoptotic effect of NCKU-21 in both NSCLC cell lines. Moreover, cell migration and translational levels of the gelatinases, MMP-2 and MMP-9, were obviously reduced in both NSCLC cell lines after incubation with NCKU-21. Experimental data obtained from molecular docking suggested that NCKU-21 can bind to the catalytic pocket of MMP-9. However, the in vitro enzyme activity assay indicated that NCKU-21 has the potential to increase MMP-9 activity.Our results suggest that NCKU-21 can effectively reduce cell migration and induce apoptosis in A549 and CL1-5 cells, the toxicological effects of which may be partly modulated through PI3K-AKT inhibition, AMPK activation, an increase in the p53 protein, and gelatinase inhibition."

Therefore, the study of canine cancer can provide useful information to the oncology field. This study aimed to establish and characterize a panel of primary mixed cell cultures obtained from spontaneous canine mammary tumors. Eight established cell cultures obtained from one normal mammary gland, one complex adenoma, one mixed adenoma, two complex carcinomas and two mixed carcinomas were analyzed. The gene expression levels of classic molecular cancer players such as fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 2, breast cancer (BRCA) 1, BRCA2 and estrogen receptor (ESR) 1 were evaluated. For the first time, three orphan nuclear receptors, estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) α, β and γ were studied in canine mammary cancer. The highest expression level of ERRα was observed in complex carcinoma-derived cell culture, while the highest levels of ERRβ and γ were observed in cells derived from a mixed carcinoma. Meanwhile, complex carcinomas presented the highest levels of expression of ESR1, BRCA1 and FGFR2 among all samples. BRCA2 was found exclusively in complex adenoma. The transcription factor GATA3 had its highest levels in mixed carcinoma samples and its lowest levels in complex adenoma. Proliferation assays were also performed to evaluate the mixed cell cultures response to ER ligands, genistein and DES, both in normoxia and hypoxic conditions. Our results demonstrate that morphological and functional studies of primary mixed cell cultures derived from spontaneous canine mammary tumors are possible and provide valuable tool for the study of various stages of mammary cancer development."

Compared to controls, the application of urea to A. pinnata resulted in a 44% decrease in nitrogenase activity, no significant change in glutamine synthetase activity, 660% higher glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, 39% increase in free amino acid levels, 22% increase in malondialdehyde levels, 21% increase in Na+/K+- levels, 16% increase in Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPase levels, and 11% decrease in superoxide dismutase activity. In terms of H2O2 detoxifying enzymes, peroxidase activity did not change and catalase activity increased by 64% in urea-treated A. pinnata. These findings suggest that urea application promotes amino acid metabolism and membrane lipid peroxidation in A. pinnata."

https://openalex.org/W2758314500,"In this paper, we test the hypothesis that health technology assessment units located in hospitals tend to be more optimistic toward technologies that are currently in use in their organization than technologies that are not. The data include 108 health technologies assessed in 87 full-scale health technology assessment reports produced by the four main local health technology assessment units in Quebec (Canada) on behalf of decision makers from the same facility. We found that 58 (53.7 percent) of the 108 technologies were currently in use within the hospital during their assessment. Based on the assessors' interpretation of the scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of the technologies, 67.3 percent of the technologies that were in use in the hospital during the evaluation were effective (56 percent for those that were not currently being used), but the difference is not statistically significant (chi-square 1.38; p = 0.24). Controlling for the efficacy judgment, the type of technologies (i.e. preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic or organizational), the number of technologies assessed in the report and the assessment unit, we found that the technologies that were currently in use in the facility during the evaluation were 62 percent more likely to be recommended favorably by the assessment unit than the technologies that were not currently being used (RR = 1.62; 95 percent CI = 1.06-1.88). This suggests that the local health technology units that were examined in the study tended to be more optimistic toward technologies that were currently in use in their hospital at the time of the evaluation."
