https://openalex.org/W2018661276,"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) antigen is a normal basement membrane zone antigen of epidermis and other stratified squamous epithelia. It is defined immunologically by antibodies in the sera of patients with the subepidermal blistering disease BP. In this study we sought to demonstrate that epidermal cells synthesize this antigen, to determine the immunological specificity of BP antibodies and to characterize this antigen. Cultured human epidermal cells (HEC) and a spontaneously transformed mouse epidermal cell line (Pam) both demonstrated BP antigen by indirect immunofluorescence. To characterize the antigen, these cells were radiolabeled with 35S-methionine or 14C-amino acids and extracts were immunoprecipitated using nine different BP sera. Immunoprecipitated proteins were identified using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and fluorography. All nine BP sera precipitated a protein with disulfide-linked chains of apparent molecular weight approximately 220 kd. Eight normal human sera and six pemphigus vulgaris sera, as well as antibodies directed against fibronectin and laminin, did not precipitate this protein. Furthermore, it was not precipitated by BP sera from radiolabeled extracts of fibroblasts. The protein was soluble in Tris-HCI buffered saline but was not secreted into the culture medium. These studies demonstrate that BP antigen is synthesized by epidermal cells in culture, different patients with BP have antibodies against the same protein, and BP antigen can be identified on SDS-PAGE as a high molecular weight protein consisting of disulfide-linked chains of approximate molecular weight 220 kd."

Strominger Harvard University The Biological Laboratories Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 Introduction More than 40 years ago skin grafting experiments carried out in mice showed that the rejection of grafts is under genetic control. Differences between individ- ual mice at any of a number of loci could lead to graft rejection. However, one locus stood out in its ability to provoke graft rejection; it was subsequently named the H-2 locus, or major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (Klein, 1975). Not until some 25 years later, by a rather different route, could a similar region be identified in humans, which has been named the HLA region (Bach and van Rood, 1976). Although originally discovered through grafting ex- periments, the MHC has been analyzed most exten- sively with serological reagents. In mice, individual animals will produce antibodies after deliberate im- munization with lymphoid cells or after skin grafting when differences exist between the immunizing and responding animal with respect to histocompatibility loci. Sera of exquisite specificity can be obtained through the use of congenic mouse strains (strains of mice that have identical genetic backgrounds, but differ only in a well defined segment of the genome- for example, in the MHC or a portion of it [Snell, 1980]). With the advent of monoclonal antibodies (Moller, 1979) the specificity of serologic reagents can be even more precise. In humans, most antibodies for the analysis of the HLA system are derived from women who have been pregnant multiple times and are immunized by pater- nal antigens present on fetal cells in the maternal circulation. Depending on the differences in HLA type and the degree of antigenic stimulation, these re- agents can be of sufficiently high titer and specificity to be used as tissue-typing reagents. Again, mono- clonal antibodies may improve the serological defini- tion of HLA antigens (Parham and Bodmer, 1978; Brodsky et al., 1979). One of the features of the MHC that was quickly uncovered is its extensive polymorphism (Klein, 1979). It is now thought that at each of the recognized loci in the H-2 complex up to a hundred alleles may exist in the population. For the HLA loci, a high degree of polymorphism has also been demonstrated (Figure 1). By applying serological techniques to the study of inbred strains of mice and human families carrying"
https://openalex.org/W2071581153,"The levels of H2A and H2B mRNAs as a function of cell-cycle stage were determined by hybridization methods. The analysis was extended to H3 and H4 mRNAs by in vitro translation. Cells were partitioned into cell-cycle stages either by centrifugal elutriation or by G1 synchronization with the yeast mating pheromone, α factor. The data lead to the following conclusions. First, histone mRNA can be detected in significant quantities only in S-phase cells. Second, the point of maximal accumulation of histone mRNA is not coincident with the point of maximal DNA synthesis; rather, histone mRNA begins accumulating very early in S, reaching a maximum when less than one half of the DNA has replicated. From this point in the cell cycle the histone mRNA levels decrease, reaching basal levels at the end of S. Third, in spite of the fact that the rate of histone mRNA accumulation is not coincident with the rate of DNA synthesis, the two processes are coupled; inhibition of DNA synthesis results in an extremely rapid disappearance of histone mRNA that is much shorter than the normal histone mRNA half-life. Fourth, there is no visible accumulation of mRNA precursors at any cell-cycle stage. We can conclude that, in yeast, histone mRNA levels are tightly and coordinately regulated throughout cell division and that this regulation most likely occurs at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. We also show that the two genetically unlinked H2B genes present in yeast are both expressed at comparable levels and are regulated. The regulation is probably sequence-specific, since genes in close proximity to the histones are not subject to cell-cycle control."

https://openalex.org/W1494815324,"A low molecular weight polypeptide with multiplication-stimulating activity (MSA) was isolated from serum-free media conditioned by a clone of normal Buffalo rat liver cells. The purification of MSA was achieved by gel permeation chromatography of the acid-soluble growth-promoting activity on Bio-Gel P-10 in 1 M acetic acid and followed by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography on muBondapak C18 support using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The primary structure of MSA has been determined. MSA is a single chain polypeptide of 67 residues, with a calculated molecular weight of 7,484, and displays 93% homology with the functionally related human insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). A comparison between the sequences of rat MSA and human IGF-II reveals only five amino acid substitutions. Based on the extensive amino acid sequence homology, we propose the term rat IGF-II for this newly isolated polypeptide."

Laser microbeams can be used for microirradiation of selected nucleolar genetic regions and for laser microdissection of mitotic and cytoplasmic organelles. They are also used to disrupt the developing neurosensory appendages of the cricket and the imaginal discs of Drosophila.
https://openalex.org/W1540892680,"A purification procedure for L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.4) from yeast is described. The method routinely produces enrichments of 500-fold with 20-40% yields. In addition, a procedure for obtaining highly specific and purified antibody against the protein is described. The molecular weight of the native enzyme as determined by gel filtration is approximately 240,000. A single subunit of approximately Mr = 62,000 is detected upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme. The purified antibody was used to assay crude extracts of wild type and inositol-requiring mutants for the presence of cross-reacting material. Mutant ino1-13 produces an inactive but fully cross-reacting protein of a molecular weight identical with the wild type enzyme subunit. Mutant ino1-16 produces low levels of a fully active enzyme which appears to be more susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Mutants representing other unlinked loci (ino2 and ino4) do not produce cross-reacting protein. Based on this analysis, the ino1 locus is identified as the structural gene for the enzyme. Furthermore, it is shown that the Mr = 62,000 subunit is largely absent from crude extracts prepared from wild type yeast grown in the presence of repressing concentrations of inositol."
https://openalex.org/W2102668389,"The levels of four ribosomal protein (rp) mRNAs in different mutant strains were determined by hydridization of radiolabeled cloned genes to RNA fractionated on CH3HgOH gels and transferred to DBM paper. Two ribosomal protein genes (rp 51 and rp 52) controlled by the locus RNA2 have dramatically decreased mRNA levels after a shift-up to the nonpermissive temperature in a strain carrying the rna2 mutation (ts368). Two ribosomal protein genes not controlled by the RNA2 locus and several control nonribosomal protein genes are relatively unaffected by the temperature shift in this strain. Other genes in the vicinity of one of the rna2-sensitive ribosomal protein genes (th rp 51 gene) are insensitive to the rna2 gene product, suggesting that all ribosomal protein genes do not occur in clusters and that the RNA2 gene product does not affect a large region of chromatin. In ts368 at the nonpermissive temperature, the concentration of higher molecular weight transcripts complementary to the rp 51 and the rp 52 plasmids is increased. Analysis of the rp 51 plasmid transcripts reveals that the temperature-induced higher molecular weight transcripts differ from the mature rp 51 mRNA by the presence of an intron. This observation and the kinetics with which the concentration of the various rp 51 transcripts change after a temperature shift suggest that the effect of rna2 may be at the level of processing of rp mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1508811377,"The glucose transport mechanism of rat epididymal fat cells was reconstituted into egg lecithin liposomes, and their carrier-mediated transport activity ws estimated from the difference in the rates of uptake of D-[3H]glucose and L-[14C]glucose. Insulin increased the glucose transport activity in the plasma membrane-rich fraction while decreasing the activity in the Golgi-rich fraction in agreement with our previous data (Suzuki, K., and Kono, T. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 2542-2545). The development of the insulin effects was inhibited when cells were exposed to 2,4-dinitrophenol or KCN before the insulin treatment. In addition, the reversal of the insulin effects was blocked upon exposure of insulin-treated cells to 2,4-dinitrophenol or KCN prior to the elimination of the hormone. In contrast, neither development nor reversal of the insulin effects was affected by cycloheximide or puromycin. The temperature coefficients of the transport activities reconstituted from the basal or insulin-treated forms of the plasma membrane-rich or Golgi-rich fractions were all identical. The recoveries of protein, 5'-nucleotidase, UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine galactosyltransferase, and NADH dehydrogenase into subcellular fractions were determined. However, net effects of insulin on the glucose transport activities have remained unknown for lack of an appropriate marker enzyme of the Golgi-like vesicles associated with the transport activity. It is suggested that the glucose transport mechanism is recycled between the plasma membrane-rich and Golgi-rich fractions by an energy-dependent reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2067986257,"We have isolated a heat-sensitive beta-tubulin mutation, benA33, that blocks nuclear division and nuclear movement at restrictive temperature. This blockage demonstrates that the beta tubulin encoded by the benA gene is essential to both processes. The blockage of both processes is suppressed by the alpha-tubulin mutation, tubA1; thus the alpha tubulin encoded by the tubA gene must also be involved in both processes. When benA33 is shifted from a permissive to restrictive temperature, nuclei are blocked in mitosis. Light microscopy of blocked nuclei reveals that benA33 inhibits movement of chromosomes to the poles, and electron microscopy of blocked nuclei shows that they contain apparently normal spindles. Thus benA33 does not block microtubule assembly but, directly or indirectly, blocks microtubule disassembly. BenA33 also confers resistance to several antimicrotubule agents and the heat sensitivity conferred by benA33 is suppressed by each of these agents. We suggest that the simplest explanation for these effects is that benA33 causes a temperature-dependent hyperstabilization of microtubules that blocks chromosomal movement by blocking microtubule disassembly."
https://openalex.org/W2065641032,"Monoclonal antibodies (JLB1 and JLB7) that recognize minor components of the intermediate filament system of cultured cells were introduced into living fibroblasts by microinjection. Several minutes after injection of the JLB7 antibody virtually all of the intermediate filaments of the cells were found to be aggregated into tight bundles near or around the nucleus. In contrast, injection of the JLB1 antibody caused little or no aggregation of the intermediate filaments. Electron microscopy showed that the perinuclear bundles that formed after injection of the JLB7 antibody each consisted of ten or more filaments apparently crosslinked together. Double-label immunofluorescence microscopy showed that virtually all of the vimentin-containing intermediate filaments in the JLB7 antibody-injected cells were redistributed to the perinuclear region and remained there for at least 24 hr. The distributions of actin microfilaments and microtubules were seemingly undisturbed following microinjection. No obvious changes in cell morphology or behavior were apparent in the cells injected with JLB7 antibody; the cells displayed a flat appearance, showed a polarity, were able to ruffle and bleb and even appeared to show the normal saltatory movements of intracellular vesicles, granules and mitochondria, suggesting that intermediate filaments are not involved in these activities. The microinjection of highly specific monoclonal antibodies that recognize and alter components of the cell provides an additional approach to determine the in vivo functions of intracellular elements."
https://openalex.org/W2035747691,"Polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes, highly motile ameboid cells vital for mammalian defense against infection, acquire a distinct polarized morphology during locomotion and phagocytosis. An organelle-excluding pseudopod extends in the direction of movement and surrounds objects during phagocytosis. The anterior pseudopod contains a three-dimensional network of actin filaments. Actin-binding protein (ABP) and myosin cause the crosslinking and contraction, respectively, of actin filaments in vitro. We used indirect immunofluorescence to study the redistribution of myosin and ABP molecules in rabbit PMN leukocytes during locomotion and phagocytosis. In unpolarized PMN leukocytes, ABP and myosin had a diffuse distribution with some predilection for the cortex. In polarized PMN leukocytes crawling toward yeast particles, myosin and ABP staining concentrated in the anterior pseudopod. In PMN leukocytes fixed during phagocytosis of the yeast particles, antimyosin and anti-ABP staining concentrated strikingly in the distal portions of the pseudopod embracing the yeasts. Staining for catalase, a cytoplasmic protein in PMN leukocytes, for lactoferrin, a protein of specific granules, and for myeloperoxidase, a protein of azurophilic granules, was not concentrated in pseudopods. Taken together with available morphologic and biochemical information, these findings are consistent with a mechanism wherein interactions of actin, ABP and myosin redistribute cortical cytoplasm into pseudopods involved in locomotion and phagocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W2144527124,"E. coli ribosomal protein L1 is a translational repressor of the synthesis in vitro of both proteins encoded in the L11 operon (L11 and L1). L1 is shown to act at a single target site within the first 160 bases of the bicistronic mRNA, near (or at) the translation initiation site of the L11 cistron. Synthesis of L1 apparently requires translation of the preceding L11 cistron, allowing regulation of the synthesis of both proteins from a single mRNA target site. This observation suggests a sequential translation mechanism that results in the equimolar synthesis rates of the two proteins observed in vivo. It was found that the presence of 23S rRNA, but not 16S rRNA, relieves translational inhibition by L1. L1 presumably recognizes structural features of the mRNA target site that are homologous to the L1-binding site of 23S rRNA. Although previous work indicated that translationally inhibited ribosomal protein mRNA is degraded in vivo, L1 repressor action in the present in vitro system was found not to involve mRNA degradation."

This region consists of 543 bp and contains sufficient information to code for only two small polypeptides of 34 and 30 amino acids each. Deletion of the ATG start codons for these two polypeptides has no effect on expression of incC incompatibility. A prominent feature of this sequence is the presence of five 22 bp direct repeats. A 58 bp segment of the incC region that contains two of these direct repeats was inserted into plasmid pACYC184, which is compatible with the F plasmid. The pACYC184 plasmid containing the direct-repeat sequences now expresses incompatibility with the F'lac plasmid and replication-proficient derivatives of the mini-F plasmid."

https://openalex.org/W1510550528,"The absorption, fluorescence, and circular dichroism properties of Escherichia coli thioredoxin, and of its tryptic fragments thioredoxin-T-(1-73) and thioredoxin-T-(74-108), in water and in trifluoroethanol, have been investigated as a function of pH and temperature in order to gain information about their conformational behavior. Both reduced and oxidized thioredoxin have a remarkable conformational stability as judged from CD spectra at various pH values and temperatures. The percentage of secondary structure in solution was calculated using the procedures suggested in the literature, but no satisfactory agreement with the x-ray data could be obtained. The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. The fluorescence spectrum shows an intense tyrosine contribution, whose intensity is strongly pH-dependent in the acidic region. An interaction with a carboxylate group (tentatively Tyr-49 with Asp-104) is suggested. The pH dependence of the fluorescence intensity of tryptophan in reduced thioredoxin is also surprisingly marked, and a group with pK = 6.4, having a high quenching efficiency in the deprotonated form, is deemed responsible for this behavior. This is ascribed to one of the two reactive cysteine residues, whose negative charge is probably stabilized by Lys-36. Various spectroscopic/conformational studies have been carried out on the two fragments (1-73) and (74-108). The salient result is that the (1-73) fragment, which assumes a largely aperiodic structure at neutral and alkaline pH, is able to refold in a globular and stable structure when the pH is below approximately 3.0. This process is attended by marked changes in the fluorescence and CD spectra. The refolding mechanism and its implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2007167231,"The copy number of yeast histone genes was increased by inserting an extra H2A,H2B gene pair into the haploid genome by the technique of yeast transformation. The presence of this extra gene copy has no detectable effect on cell growth. The steady-state levels of histone H2A,H2B mRNAs are not elevated in transformed strains, and they correspond to the levels measured for the parental strain. The transcription rate is increased in these strains, however, and the parental steady-state levels of histone mRNAs are maintained by increased turnover of histone transcripts. These results demonstrate that yeast histone genes display dosage compensation through the operation of posttranscriptional controls. They also suggest that maintenance of a constant ratio between histone mRNA concentration and the rate of chromosome replication may be of general importance to histone mRNA metabolism."

Proton translocation following pulses of nitrite was also observed with endogenous substrate in freshly harvested cells and with lactate or formate as electron donors in starved cells. Problems in the determination of H+/2e- ratios when endogenous substrate, formate, or lactate was the electron donor are discussed.

https://openalex.org/W1984970856,"A DNA-directed in vitro protein-synthesizing system was used to demonstrate that r protein S7 has the capacity to inhibit the translation of mRNA for the second and third gene products of the str operon (S7 and EF-G) but not for the first gene product (S12). Translation of mRNA of the last gene product in the operon (EF-Tu) is also probably not inhibited by S7. In addition, we localized the target site for S7 repressor action on the polycistronic str mRNA by examining the repressor activity of S7 in vitro using various template DNAs that contain the gene. The target site was found not to include a promoter-proximal portion of the mRNA for S12. To test for regulatory properties of S7 in vivo, we inserted the S7 gene into a plasmid vector containing the ara regulatory elements such that S7 synthesis was placed under ara control.

https://openalex.org/W1490343705,"Abstract The 113Cd NMR has been observed for Cd(II)-substituted horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (LADH) and its complexes with coenzymes and several substrate analogs. Compared to free enzyme, the catalytic Cd(II) resonance is shielded by 41--41 ppm in both LADH-NADH and LADH-NAD+. In ternary complexes of LADH-NAD+ with either trifluoroethanol or pyrazole, this resonance narrows and is deshielded by 75 ppm. The LADH-NADH-butyramide complex gives only 3 ppm of deshielding relative to the LADH-NADH resonance. At pH = 10.3, the catalytic resonance of unbound LADH is broadened and slightly deshielded. No other resonances are dependent upon pH in the range 8--10. These data are the most consistent with a second sphere coordination of the substrate analogs to the catalytic metal ion. The observed difference between complexes of the alcohol analogs and the aldehyde analog would then be explained as the presence of a hydroxide versus a water molecule, respectively, in the first coordination sphere. The data also show that the pKa of the coordinated water on the Zn(II) in the native LADH is close to 9.2 as previously assumed, whereas the pKa of the Zn(II)-bound water in the LADH-NAD+ complex is most likely greater than 9 and not 7.6 as previously assumed."

R. (1966) J. Biol. Chem. 241, 5201-5204). The 4-phosphopantetheine moiety of CoA is transferred by the enzyme holo-[ACP] synthase to apo-[acyl carrier protein] (apo-[ACP]) to form holo-[ACP], the form active in lipid synthesis. We mutagenized an E. coli K12 pantothenate auxotroph and selected for mutants unable to grow on a low concentration of pantothenate (0.25 microM) but that grew on a much higher level (25 microM). One of these strains was completely deficient in holo-[ACP] synthase. Reversion and recombinational genetic analyses indicated that the mutant growth phenotype was due to an altered holo-[ACP] synthase activity. The changes in the intracellular levels of CoA and holo-[ACP] engendered by manipulation of the levels of pantothenate supplementation were consistent with a deficiency in holo-[ACP] synthase activity in cultures supplemented with low levels of pantothenate. The site of the genetic lesion (called acpS) was localized on the E. coli genetic map."
https://openalex.org/W1582682004,"Physiological concentrations of polyamines contribute significantly to both the speed and precision of aminoacylation of tRNA. Unphysiologically high concentrations of magnesium ion are required to obtain high rates of synthesis of phenylalanyl-tRNAPheyeast catalyzed by yeast phenylalanine:tRNA ligase in vitro. Under such conditions, rates of misacylation (e.g. the synthesis of Phe-tRNAValE.coli) may be one-fifth of the rate of correct acylation. High rates of correct aminoacylation are achieved in the presence of physiological concentrations of magnesium (1.0 mM) plus spermine (0.2 mM). Under these conditions, there is almost no misacylation. A kinetic study of the magnesium dependence of aminoacylation shows that the rate-determining transition state for Phe-tRNAPhe synthesis contains, in addition to tightly bound Mg2+, either two spermines (Kd = approximately 50 microM) or 2 Mg2+ ions (Kd = approximately 1.0 mM). We postulate that the tRNAPhe binds two spermines to form a very compact, very precisely defined structure that easily forms an activated E.S conformer, E.S (Jencks' Circe Effect). In the absence of spermine, 2 Mg2+ ions bind somewhat more poorly to the tRNA to form a similar but not identical tRNA conformer which, in turn, is less able to form E.S and thus more slowly aminoacylated. Misacylation of noncognate tRNA requires several additional, more loosely bound Mg2+ ions that serve to relax the tRNA structure. Such magnesium-driven relaxation has a minor effect on Km (tRNA), but the resulting floppy structure is able to avoid the barriers against reaction and is amino-acylated thousands of times more rapidly than the compact defined structure."

https://openalex.org/W1576933830,"Interactions between subfractions of ox thymus H1 histone and either linear T7 DNA or superhelical PM2 DNA were studied by measuring the circular dichroism of H1:DNA complexes. H1 subfractions differed from one to the next in their effectiveness at distorting the circular dichroic spectrum of DNA by as much as 3- to 4-fold for both forms of DNA. The order of effectiveness of the subfractions was the same at all ionic strengths between 0.05 M and 0.25 M, but the degree of spectral distortion caused by any of the subfractions was sensitive to the salt concentration. At 0 M NaCl and above 3 M NaCl, there was little or no distortion of the spectrum of DNA by any subfraction; the maximum effectiveness for all of the subfractions was at 0.15 M to 0.2 M NaCl whether the DNA was linear or superhelical. Between 0 M and 0.15 M NaCl, the H1 subfractions in free solution underwent a conformational change from a substantially unfolded state to one that is presumably the native state. This was revealed by circular dichroism. In part, this folding of the protein molecules must account for the effect of salt on the ability of H1 to distort the circular dichroism of DNA when the two macromolecules are brought together in complex formation. The distortion of the circular dichroism of DNA by H1:DNA complex formation is thought to be due to side-by-side aggregation of fibers in an asymmetrically ordered array. Apparently, the different H1 subfractions induce formation of H1:DNA complexes that differ in degree of orderliness or in a more complicated geometric parameter of the array, and this is true for superhelical as well as linear DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1603803608,"The pH dependence of binding of [TyrA14-125I]monoiodoinsulin to isolated rat adipocytes was investigated at 37 degrees C. Although the amount of tracer bound at steady state at pH 7.8 was 6 times that at pH 6.8, the fractional degradation of receptor-bound iodoinsulin remained the same. The decreased binding at acidic pH could be accounted for by a decrease in the affinity. The pH-induced change in affinity was similar for iodoinsulin and insulin. The half-time of dissociation was not changed in the pH range 7.0 to 7.8. The presence of 25 nM insulin in the wash out medium caused a small increase in the dissociation of tracer independent of pH. Kinetic experiments revealed that the decreased affinity at acidic pH was mainly due to a decrease in the association rate constant. The decreased binding at acidic pH was reflected in a shift to the right of the insulin dose-response curve for initial rate of uptake of 3-O-[methyl-14C]glucose and the rate of conversion of glucose to lipids. It is concluded that the degradation of bound iodoinsulin is independent of pH (6.8 to 8.8), that the decreased binding at acidic pH is due to a decreased association rate constant, and that cells in acidic milieu are relatively insulin-resistant."

Analysis of the exchange kinetics according to this reaction scheme yields a rate constant for the dissociation of GDP from the ternary complex of greater than or equal to 1270 s-1. The equilibrium association constants for GDP and EF-Ts to form the ternary complex was found to be 6.4 x 10(4) M-1 and 1.8 x 10(5) M-1, respectively. These results demonstrate that the dissociation of GDP from EF-Tu in the presence of EF-Ts is not the rate-limiting process in protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1585901412,"Abstract IF-3 strikingly inhibits the rate of association of 30 S and 50 S subunits to form 70 S ribosome, at all Mg2+ concentrations between 1 and 18 mM, in 60 mM KCl, pH 7.8, at 26 degrees C. The rate of formation of 70 S is determined from the increase in light scattering intensity in stopped flow experiments in which, typically, largely dissociated 30 S-50S mixtures in 2 mM Mg2+ buffer are jumped against high [Mg2+] buffers containing either no or 1-2 eq of IF-3. The curves can be analyzed using two reactions (the model): 30 S + 50 S (formula see text) Both forward rates are large: in the physiologically important range, 3-6 mM Mg2+, k1 increases from 0.4 to 15 X 10(6) M-1 s-1, while k2 ranges from 3 to 18 X 10(6) M-1 s-1. The kinetic curves have a characteristic shape: an early spurt of 70 S particle formation while IF-3 and 50 S particles are competing for the large initial pool of free 30 S subunits, and a slower phase in which 70 S formation is controlled by the release of 30 S subunits from the 30 S.IF-3 complexes (k-2 runs between 0.05 and 0.17 s-1). The addition of a third reaction, 30 S.IF-3 + 50 S (formula see text) 70 S + IF-3, is not required for an adequate fit, changes the values of k2 slightly, and of k-2 not too much, and yields values of k-3 (0-20 X 10(3) M-1 s-1) probably too small to play a significant physiological role in initiation of protein synthesis unaided by other interactions. The anti-association effect of IF-3 on ribosomal subunits is clear-cut. The pro-dissociation effect on 70 S ribosomes remains to be demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W140021489,"Bacteriophage fd replicative form DNA with a nick in the viral strand serves as a template for DNa replication with purified bacteriophage T4 enzymes. As anticipated from previous in vitro studies carried out with this system (Morris, C. F., Sinha, N. K., and Alberts, B. M. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 72, 4800-4804), DNA is synthesized by a rolling circle mechanism. We show here that the DNA strands synthesized are processed by the phage fd gene 2 protein into unit length products, providing that the gene 2 protein is present at the moment when this DNA is made. The products are mostly unit length linear single strands, indicating that the circularization step normally catalyzed by gene 2 protein subsequent to its site-specific cleavage of an fd DNA strand occurs only inefficiently in this system. The gene 2 protein reduces the level of DNA synthesis by 2-fold at low concentrations, even though it only cleaves the DNA products efficiently at higher levels of the enzyme. This indicates that there are at least two different effects of the fd gene 2 protein in processing of viral fd DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1575842652,"The polypeptide hormone insulin and the binding portion of ricin toxin, the B chain, were linked via a disulfide bond. This insulin-ricin B chain conjugate bound to insulin receptors with a potency one-twentieth that of native insulin. Rat HTC hepatoma cells, a cultured cell line that has relatively few insulin receptors, bound the conjugate to a much greater degree than insulin. Binding occurred predominantly via the ricin B chain portion of the conjugate since binding was not inhibited by insulin but was inhibited by galactose, a known inhibitor of the interaction of ricin B chain to its receptor. In HTC cells, the insulin-ricin B chain conjugate at 330 nM stimulated amino acid uptake to 225% of controls, a value higher than that for insulin which stimulated uptake to only 167% of controls. The conjugate also stimulated tyrosine aminotransferase activity in HTC cells with a potency value approximately one-half that of insulin. Both of these activities of the insulin-ricin B chain conjugate in HTC cells were inhibited by 100 mM galactose (90% and 80%, respectively), whereas the ability of insulin to stimulate these activities was not inhibited significantly by this sugar. The results suggest, therefore, that one can construct hybrid molecules consisting of binding proteins and polypeptide hormones and that these hybrid molecules can have binding and biological activities which are different from the parent hormone molecule."

Using a diagonal chromatographic procedure on an anion exchange column for isolation and quantitative detection, up to 0.3 mumol of hydroxypyruvaldehyde-P/liter of packed cells was found. If glycolysis was blocked by inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase with N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetate, 0.7 mumol of hydroxypyruvaldehyde-P/liter of packed erythrocytes was detected. Hydroxypyruvaldehyde-P, found for the first time in eukaryotic cells, might be one of the long sought natural substrates of the glyoxalases."
https://openalex.org/W1504493790,"Acrosin, an enzyme required for fertilization, is an endogenous proteinase associated with membranes of the sperm acrosome. Liposomes were utilized as a model system to evaluate the mode of association between highly purified boar acrosin and phospholipid bilayer membranes. Acrosin was observed to bind to liposomes containing acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, and phosphatidylserine. There was no apparent binding of acrosin to liposomes which consisted of nonacidic phospholipids, thus indicating that an ionic phospholipid constituent was required for binding. Increased ionic strength caused a significant reduction in acrosin-liposome association with an inverse effect on enzyme-membrane dissociation. Acrosin-liposome association and dissociation were similarly effected by increasing concentrations of divalent cations at constant ionic strength, and by reductions in pH. Equilibrium binding experiments, with anionic liposomes, suggest the presence of either multiple classes of independent binding sites, or apparent negative cooperativity, with a range in the apparent affinity constant (Ka) from 2 x 10(11) M-1 at low acrosin concentrations to 3 x 10(8) M-1 at high acrosin concentrations. The membrane-associated enzyme was accessible to concanavalin A, and to high molecular weight substrates, demonstrating that a portion of the acrosin molecule is exposed at the membrane surface. In addition, acrosin binding to liposomes had no apparent effect of hydrolysis of soluble protein or synthetic substrates. The results demonstrate that acrosin-liposome binding is due in part to electrostatic charge interactions and indicate that the enzyme has properties of an extrinsic membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1612490102,"The nature of the activable form of renin in the kidney and other tissues has not been clear. Its identification and isolation from kidney have been hampered by rapid activation due to high levels of proteases. Using a pepstatin-Sepharose column, which distinguishes inactive renin from the active enzyme, evidence was obtained for the presence of a totally inactive zymogenic precursor of renin in the pituitary, pineal, and other regions of hog brain. The precursor has an approximate molecular weight of 50,000 and conversion to the active enzyme causes reduction in molecular weight to 43,000. Conversion of this active enzyme to an active but high molecular weight form (60,000) was also observed when the pituitary extract was treated with thiol-blocking reagents. This result was interpreted to indicate the presence of a binding protein. This study has demonstrated that inactive renin zymogen is different from so-called active big renin, which is a complex of active renin and the binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W91657559,"A cell-free translation system, from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been used to develop an in vitro assay for yeast UGA, ochre and amber suppressors. Amber suppression was assayed by read-through of the brome mosaic virus coat protein cistron UAG terminator. UGA suppression was assayed by read-through of the rabbit beta-globin UGA terminator and ochre suppression by read-through of the rabbit alpha-globin mRNA UAA terminator. Ochre suppression was increased 3-fold when the globin mRNA was heat denatured prior to translation; this was due to an increase in the synthesis of alpha-globin relative to beta-globin. Amber suppression was more efficient in vitro (46%) than ochre suppression (14%). UGA suppression was also highly efficient in vitro, reaching almost 100% using a purified UGA suppressor tRNA from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Unfractionated yeast tRNA, from a sup+ strain, contained a tRNA species able to suppress UGA termination codons in vitro, but no tRNA species able to suppress either UAA or UAG was found. This homologous in vitro assay for yeast nonsense suppressors will allow, for the first time, an approach to the biochemical analysis of yeast mutants that modify the efficiency of nonsense suppression in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1502955539,"We have studied the specification of the apparent molecular weight form of the var1 polypeptide by the var1 determinant region located on mitochondrial DNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A complementation assay has been developed whereby mitochondrial translation products can be labeled selectively in zygotes with 35SO42-. The procedure takes advantage of the fact that met- cys- grande (rho +) strains are unable to incorporate 35SO42- into protein. When such a strain is crossed with a met+ cys petite (rho -) and cells of the mating mixture are labeled with 35SO42- in the presence of cycloheximide under conditions where glycolysis is inoperative, only mitochondrial translation products within zygotes are labeled. Using this procedure with petites containing the var1 determinant region, we find that as much as 75% of the total polypeptide synthesized in zygotes is the form specified by the petite var1 allele. Moreover, mitochondria containing mixed mitochondrial genomes (rho + and rho -) can be isolated from zygotes, and both the rho + and rho - var1 alleles are expressed in vitro. From these results and the analysis of discriminating petites in which var1 recombination can be distinguished from complementation, we conclude that the var1 determinant can specify the apparent molecular weight form of the var1 polypeptide in trans."

The purified enzyme was shown to be homogeneous on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, and most active at about pH 5.5. The molecular weight was determined to be approximately 60,000-62,000 by gel filtration. The enzyme was specific for riboflavin; other compounds such as alcohol, sugar, phenol or nucleoside were not oxidized by this enzyme, as far as tested. alpha-NAD+, beta-NAD+, alpha-NADP+, beta-NADP+, FMN, FAD, and cytochrome c were not active as an electron acceptor. 2,6-Dichlorophenolindophenol served as a good electron acceptor, and phenazine methosulfate and methylene blue were found to be somewhat effective. The enzyme stoichiometrically oxidized 1 mol of riboflavin with 1 mol of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol as electron acceptor. The enzyme reaction was completely inhibited by 10 microM Hg2+, but was not inhibited by sulfhydryl reagent, carbonyl reagent, and metal chelator. Kinetics analysis gave a Km value of 17 microM for riboflavin."

https://openalex.org/W1629689455,"An altered form of thioredoxin, composed of two peptides with molecular weights of 7 and 5 X 10(3) has been isolated from Escherichia coli B after chromatography on Ultrogel AcA54. The position of the clip site, determined by amino acid sequencing to lie between Pro(64) and Gly(65), is consistent with a cleavage within the hinge region connecting the two prominent folding domains of thioredoxin. The NH2-terminal domain containing the active site, and the carboxyl-terminal domain correspond to the 7 and 5 X 10(3) fragments, respectively. The two peptides combine to form a tight complex, T'12. At concentrations below 10(-6) M, the clipped species was not efficiently reduced by thioredoxin reductase, showing only half the activity of native thioredoxin at a protein concentration of 9 X 10(-8) M. The Km of the clipped species for thioredoxin reductase (2.9 X 10(-6) M) was nearly equivalent to that of native thioredoxin (2.2 X 10(-6) M), and the Vmax for both native and clipped thioredoxins were nearly identical. These data are taken to imply a reversible association of the fragments to produce a thioredoxin equivalent to the intact species in its interaction with thioredoxin reductase. Some evidence exists for an unfolding of the 7 X 10(3) fragment upon dissociation of the complex. A functional role for the two-domain structure of thioredoxin is proposed in which the carboxyl domain serves to stabilize the active site within the amino domain and confer the species specificity in the binding of thioredoxin to thioredoxin reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1495893872,"One of the four subunits of bacteriophage Q beta RNA replicase is elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), the host aminoacyl-tRNA (AA-tRNA) binding protein. To determine whether the RNA polymerase activity requires the tRNA binding site of EF-Tu, we reconstituted replicase with EF-Tu . GTP covalently bound to AA-tRNA. This cross-linked ternary complex (XLTC) was formed by the reaction of N epsilon-bromoacetyl-Lys-tRNA with EF-Tu-GTP. In an EF-Tu-dependent system for the reconstitution of replicase, XLTC restored polymerase activity at least as well as an equivalent amount of EF-Tu. Replicase reconstituted with XLTC was resolved from replicase containing EF-Tu by chromatography on phosphocellulose, a result which confirmed that the tRNA moiety was incorporated into the enzyme. Chromatographic analysis of reconstitution mixtures revealed that XLTC was incorporated into replicase as extensively as EF-Tu. From these results, it appears that the AA-tRNA binding site on EF-Tu is not required for the assembly or activity of Q beta RNA replicase. Furthermore, because the tRNA macromolecule is cross-linked to His-66 of the EF-Tu, the region surrounding His-66 must normally be exposed on the surface of the replicase."
