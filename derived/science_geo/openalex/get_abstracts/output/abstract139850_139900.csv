https://openalex.org/W2096458076,"Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) uncouples respiration from oxidative phosphorylation and may contribute to obesity through effects on energy metabolism. Because basal metabolic rate is decreased in obesity, UCP2 expression is predicted to be reduced. Paradoxically, hepatic expression of UCP2 mRNA is increased in genetically obese (ob/ob) mice. <i>In situ</i> hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis of ob/ob livers demonstrate that UCP2 mRNA and protein expression are increased in hepatocytes, which do not express UCP2 in lean mice. Mitochondria isolated from ob/ob livers exhibit an increased rate of H<sup>+</sup> leak which partially dissipates the mitochondrial membrane potential when the rate of electron transport is suppressed. In addition, hepatic ATP stores are reduced and these livers are more vulnerable to necrosis after transient hepatic ischemia. Hence, hepatocytes adapt to obesity by up-regulating UCP2. However, because this decreases the efficiency of energy trapping, the cells become vulnerable to ATP depletion when energy needs increase acutely."

We show in this report that these virus-like particles (VLPs) interact with heparin and with cell-surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) resembling heparin on keratinocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells. The binding of VLPs to heparin is shown to exhibit an affinity comparable to that of other identified heparin-binding proteins. Immobilized heparin chromatography and surface plasmon resonance were used to show that this interaction can be specifically inhibited by free heparin and dextran sulfate and that the effectiveness of the inhibitor is related to its molecular weight and charge density. Sequence comparison of nine human L1 types revealed a conserved region of the carboxyl terminus containing clustered basic amino acids that bear resemblance to proposed heparin-binding motifs in unrelated proteins. Specific enzymatic cleavage of this region eliminated binding to both immobilized heparin and human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells. Removal of heparan sulfate GAGs on keratinocytes by treatment with heparinase or heparitinase resulted in an 80–90% reduction of VLP binding, whereas treatment of cells with laminin, a substrate for α6 integrin receptors, provided minimal inhibition. Cells treated with chlorate or substituted β-d-xylosides, resulting in undersulfation or secretion of GAG chains, also showed a reduced affinity for VLPs. Similarly, binding of VLPs to a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant deficient in GAG synthesis was shown to be only 10% that observed for wild type cells. This report establishes for the first time that the carboxyl-terminal portion of HPV L1 interacts with heparin, and that this region appears to be crucial for interaction with the cell surface.

The viral capsid is composed of a major and minor capsid protein, both products of late gene expression and termed L1 and L2, respectively (1Pfister H. Fuchs P.G. Intervirology. 1994; 37: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The L1 protein has a molecular mass of 55–60 kDa by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and is well conserved across types. In the virion it accounts for 80–90% of total viral protein (2Favre M. Breitburd F. Croissant O. Orth G. J. Virol. 1975; 15: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Howley P.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1990: 1625-1650Google Scholar). The viral capsid is built up from pentameric capsomers of L1, with 72 such structures arranged in a T = 7 icosohedral array (4Klug A. Finch J.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 11: 403-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Baker T.S. Newcomb W.W. Olson N.H. Cowsert L.M. Olson C. Brown J.C. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The localization of L2 in this ordered structure is not known at present nor is the mechanism of assembly, although recent reports suggest disulfide bonding may play a role (6Sapp M. Volpers C. Müller M. Streeck R.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2407-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7McCarthy M.P. White W.I. Palmer-Hill F. Koenig S. Suzich J.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 32-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over 80 types of human papillomavirus are currently identified, and many have been shown to be associated with various forms of warts occurring on the surface epithelia of skin and mucous membranes. HPV1 types can be broadly grouped into those that cause benign lesions such as condyloma acuminata and others that show the potential for malignant transformation. HPV types 11 and 6 are representative of the former and are the etiological agents responsible for approximately 90% of all benign warts associated with the anogenital tract and respiratory mucosa (8Gissmann L. Wolnik L. Ikenberg H. Koldovsky U. Schnurch H.G. zur-Hausen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Members of the second group include HPV types 16 and 18, which cause cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (9Dillner J. Wiklund F. Lenner P. Eklund C. Fredriksson-Shanazarian V. Schiller J.T. Himba M.

Science. 1991; 254: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Progress has recently been made producing either L1 alone or L1 and L2 proteins recombinantly in a number of expression systems (13Hofmann K.J. Cook J.C. Joyce J.G. Brown D.R. Schultz L.D.

It has been shown that newly synthesized L1 is translocated to the nucleus where it self-associates to form capsid-like structures that resemble the native virus but lack viral nucleic acid (14Sasagawa T. Pushko P. Steers G. Gschmeissner S.E. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Finch J. Crawford L. Tommasino M. Virology. 1995; 206: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Rose R.C. Bonnez W. Reichman R.C.

A. 1992; 89: 12180-12184Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). These virus-like particles (VLPs) are capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies and can competitively block infection by live virus (18Kirnbauer R. Booy F. Cheng N. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12180-12184Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar,19Carter J.J. Yaegashi N. Jenison S.A. Galloway D.A. Virology. 1991; 182: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because native virus has proved exceedingly difficult to propagatein vitro, the ability to produce large amounts of recombinant VLPs has greatly aided cell-based binding studies aimed at identifying candidate HPV receptors. Although papillomaviruses can bind to a wide variety of cell types (20Muller M. Gissmann L. Cristiano R.J. Sun X.Y. Frazer I.H. Jenson A.B. Alonso A. Zentgraf H. Zhou J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 948-954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Volpers C. Unckell F. Schirmacher P. Streeck R.E. Sapp M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3258-3264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), their productive tropism is generally limited to epithelial keratinocytes and fibroblasts (20Muller M. Gissmann L. Cristiano R.J. Sun X.Y. Frazer I.H. Jenson A.B. Alonso A. Zentgraf H. Zhou J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 948-954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that most HPVs can bind to cells of epithelial origin in vitro but cannot be propagated suggests that intracellular events following uptake of virus are crucial for establishment of successful infection and that host specificity is not linked to the presence of a given cell-surface receptor (20Muller M. Gissmann L. Cristiano R.J. Sun X.Y. Frazer I.H. Jenson A.B. Alonso A. Zentgraf H. Zhou J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 948-954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is particularly true in keratinocytes where establishment of infection has been linked to cellular differentiation (22Meyers C. Frattini M.G. Hudson J.B. Laimins L.A. Science. 1992; 257: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The ability of HPV to bind to a wide range of nonpermissive tissue- and species-specific cell lines argues for a receptor that is either highly conserved or of low specificity. Recently, Evanderet al. (23Evander M. Frazer I.H. Payne E. Qi Y.M. Hengst K. McMillan N.A.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2449-2456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed the α6β4 integrin as a candidate receptor based on the ability of HPV 6b VLPs to immunoprecipitate proteins with molecular weights corresponding to the integrin subunits and the ability of laminin to block VLP binding. Alternatively, HPVs may exhibit broad binding ranges as a result of a multiple receptor mechanism. In this model a receptor of relatively low specificity causes interaction of virus with the cell followed by binding to a specific protein component resulting in internalization and infection. One group of molecules able to serve as putative receptors is cell-surface glycosaminoglycans. This mode of binding has been established for herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) (24Tal-Singer R. Peng C. deLeon M.P. Abrams W.R. Banfield B.W. Tufaro F. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4471-4483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and human herpesvirus 7 (25Secchiero P. Sun D. De Vico A.L. Crowley R.W. Reitz M.S. Zauli G. Lusso P. Gallo R.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4571-4580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which binding of viral glycoproteins to cell-surface heparan sulfate molecules provides initial contact. Recent reports have suggested that GAGs may play a similar role in binding of varicella-zoster virus to human embryonic lung fibroblasts (26Zhu Z. Gershon M.D. Gabel C. Sherman D. Ambron R. Gershon A. Neurology. 1995; 45: S15-S17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, infection of cells by human immunodeficiency virus 1 can be blocked by polyanions such as dextran sulfate (27Yoshida T. Nakashima H. Yamamoto N. Uryu T. Polym. J. 1993; 25: 1069-1077Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) although proteoglycans are not implicated as viral receptors. Our laboratory has been involved in the purification and characterization of various HPV VLP types (13Hofmann K.J. Cook J.C. Joyce J.G. Brown D.R. Schultz L.D. George H.A. Rosolowsky M. Fife K.H. Jansen K.U. Virology. 1995; 209: 506-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 28Lowe R.S. Brown D.R. Bryan J.T. Cook J.C. George H.A. Hofmann K.J. Hurni W.M. Joyce J.G. Lehman E.D. Markus H.Z. Neeper M.P. Schultz L.D. Shaw A.R. Jansen K.U. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 176: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this report we have made a sequence comparison based on the method of Pearson and Lipman (29Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar) to identify a conserved region in the L1 carboxyl terminus containing amino acid sequences of the general typeXBBBBXB where B is either Arg or Lys. These are similar to the XBBXBX andXBBBXXBX sequences identified by Cardin and Weintraub (30Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as putative heparin-binding motifs. We therefore investigated the ability of L1 VLPs to bind to heparin and characterized the nature of this interaction with regard to charge and polymer size. Finally, we examined the role of cell-surface glycosaminoglycans in binding VLPs. The HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line was chosen for binding studies because it represents a cell type that serves as an in vivo infection target, and its ability to internalize HPV VLPs has been established (31Smith L.H. Foster C. Hitchcock M.E. Leiserowitz G.S. Hall K. Isseroff R. Christensen N.D. Kreider J.W. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 438-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We show in this study that the carboxyl-terminal portion of HPV 11 L1 interacts with heparin and that this interaction displays a certain degree of specificity. Furthermore, this region is shown to be crucial for interaction with the cell surface. HaCaT cells were maintained as monolayer cultures at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For sulfate-free medium, the DMEM formulation was the same except that magnesium sulfate was omitted and dialyzed FCS (Sigma) was used. CHO-K1 and pgsA-745 cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD) and were grown as monolayer cultures at 37 °C, with a 5% CO2 atmosphere in F-12K medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were routinely subcultured every 14–21 days. Recombinant HPV type 11 L1 VLPs were expressed inSaccharomyces cerevisiae using the pGal110-11 vector as described previously (32Neeper M.P. Hofmann K.J. Jansen K.U. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 180: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). VLPs were purified from clarified yeast cell lysate by ion exchange chromatography using a modification of previously described methodology (13Hofmann K.J. Cook J.C. Joyce J.G. Brown D.R. Schultz L.D. George H.A. Rosolowsky M. Fife K.H. Jansen K.U. Virology. 1995; 209: 506-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). 2J. C. Cook, manuscript in preparation. The presence of VLPs was confirmed by electron microscopy, and purity was determined by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoblotting. VLPs were quantitated using a commercial bicinchoninic protein assay (Pierce) and a specific radioimmunoassay described elsewhere (28Lowe R.S. Brown D.R. Bryan J.T. Cook J.C. George H.A. Hofmann K.J. Hurni W.M. Joyce J.G. Lehman E.D. Markus H.Z. Neeper M.P. Schultz L.D. Shaw A.R. Jansen K.U. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 176: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Aliquots (100 μg) of purified VLP preparations were concentrated by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 0 °C for 1–2 h. The pellets were resuspended at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml in 2× Laemmli buffer containing 200 mmdithiothreitol and heated at 100 °C for 15 min. Sufficient volume to give 2.5–20 μg of total protein was loaded on pre-cast 4–20% polyacrylamide gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) utilizing a Tris glycine buffer system. The gels were electrophoresed at a constant current of 30 mA/gel for 1 h. Protein bands were fixed with 12% trichloroacetic acid and visualized with a commercial colloidal Coomassie reagent (Integrated Seperation Systems, Natick, MA) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Quantitation of bands was performed using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer model SI (Sunnyvale, CA). For immunoblotting, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at a constant voltage of 25 V for 1 h. Type 11 L1 was detected using a polyclonal goat antiserum against an HPV 11 L1/TrpE fusion protein as primary antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antiserum (Pierce) as secondary antibody. Visualization was by nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-indolyphosphate ρ-toluidine reagent (Pierce). Electron microscopy was performed by Advanced Biotechnologies Inc. (Columbia, MD). Briefly, an aliquot of diluted VLPs was placed on a 300-mesh carbon-coated copper grid and air-dried. A drop (20 μl) of 2% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.0, was placed on the grid for 30 s. The grid was allowed to air-dry prior to transmission electron microscopy examination. All microscopy was performed using a Hitachi HU-12A transmission electron microscope with micrographs taken of random sections at various magnifications. Chromatography was performed on a Waters 2690XE Alliance system (Milford, MA) at ambient temperature using 1- or 5-ml cartridges of Hi-Trap® heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS, pH 7, and varying concentrations of NaCl. Flow rates were 1 or 4 ml/min for the small and large columns. Purified VLPs were diluted to the appropriate NaCl concentration in buffer and applied to the column. For most studies, the column was washed with 5 volumes of equilibration buffer, and proteins were eluted with a 10-volume linear salt gradient to 2.0 m NaCl. Absorbance was monitored using either a Waters 990 or 996 photodiode array detector. For inhibition studies, VLP preparations were diluted to 100 μg/ml in MOPS buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl. Compounds tested as inhibitors were prepared as 10 mg/ml stock solutions in MOPS buffer and added to diluted VLPs. The samples were held at 4 °C for 16–20 h and brought to ambient temperature prior to chromatography. VLPs (300 μg) were treated with bovine factor Xa (bFXa) (Hematological Technologies, Essex Junction, VT) to remove the carboxyl terminus of the L1 molecule as described elsewhere. 3C. T. Przysiecki, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, digestions were performed by blowing argon saturated with water over the surface of a 1.0-ml VLP sample in a sealed vial for 45–60 min in a 25 °C circulating water bath. The appropriate volume of bFXa or buffer (control) was added to give an enzyme/substrate weight ratio of 1/20. The sample was mixed and incubated at 25 °C for 16 h. To remove bFXa, soybean trypsin inhibitor-agarose resin (50 μl) was added, and the sample was mixed on a rotary shaker for 1 h at room temperature. Resin was pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 ×g for 15 s, and the supernatant was recovered. Denaturing PAGE was performed to determine the extent of digestion. Reversed phase identification of released peptide, intact L1, and truncated L1 was performed using a high pressure liquid chromatography assay described elsewhere.3 The BIAcore system, CM5 sensor chip, amine coupling kit, ethanolamine, and surfactant P20 were obtained from Pharmacia Biosensor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Running buffer (HBS) was 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl. Heparin was oxidized and immobilized to the CM5 chip according to BIApplications handbook (Pharmacia Biosensor). Heparin was dissolved in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, at 1 mg/ml. A 1/50 volume of freshly prepared sodium metaperiodate solution was added to give a final concentration of 1 mm. The sample was incubated on ice for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by dialysis against 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4, at 4 °C. The sensor chip surface was prepared by equilibration with HBS, 0.05% (v/v) surfactant P20 at 5 μl per min, followed by successive injections of (i) 35 μl of a mixture of equal volumes of 0.1 m N-hydroxysuccinimide, 0.1 m N-ethyl-N-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; (ii) 35 μl of 5 mm carbohydrazide; (iii) 35 μl of 1m ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5; and (iv) 35 μl of oxidized heparin at 1 mg/ml. The flow rate was lowered to 2 μl per min, and 40 μl of 0.1 m sodium cyanoborohydride in 0.1m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4, was injected. The immobilized heparin was treated with two 5-μl pulses of 20 mm HCl to remove noncovalently attached ligand. VLP preparations were diluted to the appropriate concentration of NaCl in HBS and injected (20-μl volume) onto the heparin sensorchip at a constant eluent flow rate of 5 μl/min. The chip was regenerated by a 7-μl injection of 20 mm HCl. Data points corresponding to initial binding rates were routinely collected manually except during quantitative free heparin inhibition analysis where collection was automatic. For inhibition studies, samples of VLPs were prepared as above at constant protein concentration, and inhibitors were added from concentrated stocks in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7. Samples were allowed sufficient time to reach equilibrium prior to analysis. The standard assay employed to study VLP binding to cells and the effects of various inhibitors on binding was a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cells were seeded on 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 (HaCaT) or 1 × 10 4 (CHO-K1 andpgsA-745) cells/well. Plates were maintained in standard media for 48–72 h until ≥90% confluency was reached. All subsequent steps were done at ambient temperature. Cells were washed once manually with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% aqueous paraformaldehyde for 15–30 min at ambient temperature. All subsequent washes were done in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20® (TTBS) using a Denley WellWash 5000 plate washer. Blocking buffer for VLP and antibody incubations was PBS containing 1% non-fat milk. VLPs at the proper dilutions were added for 1–2 h. Bound VLPs were detected with the conformational-specific monoclonal antibody 8740 (Chemicon, Tecumla, CA). Mouse IgG was detected with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) utilizing a 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine in hydrogen peroxide buffer detection system (Pierce). Absorbance at 450 nm was read with a Bio-Tek EL312 microplate reader. A modified form of the assay was used for certain studies. In this protocol, confluent cells were washed with PBS but not fixed. Antibody and VLP dilutions were made in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and all washes were done manually in PBS. Incubation and wash steps were performed on ice at 4 °C to minimize VLP internalization. Compounds previously determined to inhibit VLP binding to immobilized heparin were added from concentrated stock solutions to a fixed concentration of VLPs, and the samples were held for 16–20 h at 4 °C. Treated or control VLPs were diluted to the appropriate concentrations and added to fixed cells as described above. HaCaT cells were treated with a variety of reagents known to modify or inhibit synthesis of cell-surface glycosaminoglycans. For most experiments, cells were grown to ≥90% confluence on 96-well plates as described. Growth medium was removed, and fresh or sulfate-free medium containing appropriate concentrations of reagent was added. Cells were maintained for a given time at 37 °C after which they were washed and used for assay. See individual figure legends for details specific to each reagent. HaCaT cells were grown to confluence on 96-well plates. Culture medium was removed, and cells were washed once with PBS. Heparinase (forms I and II) or heparitinase (heparinase III) was diluted in digestion buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, containing 0.01% BSA) and added to cells at a final concentration of 1 or 3 units/well. Control wells consisted of buffer without enzyme. Duplicate plates were prepared and incubated at room temperature or 37 °C for 1 h. Plates were washed once with PBS. Cells were fixed and used for assay as described above. All enzymes were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant HPV 11 L1 VLPs were isolated from yeast cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1 A shows the results of SDS-PAGE analysis on 20 μg of purified VLPs. The major protein band migrating at 55,000 Da (p55) is confirmed to be HPV L1 by immunoblotting and accounts for 84% of all L1-reactive material. In addition to p55, approximately 6% of L1-reactive bands appear as high molecular weight multimers, probably representing non-denaturable aggregates, whereas the remaining 10% migrate at molecular weights below p55 and represent proteolytic degradation products of L1. Such degradates have been previously observed in this expression system (15Volpers C. Schirmacher P. Streeck R.E. Sapp M. Virology. 1994; 200: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Purity of the VLP preparation was determined to be 96% by densitometric analysis. Fig. 1 B shows an electron micrograph of a purified preparation. VLPs routinely exhibited an average diameter of 50–60 nm and were present as individual, well defined particles with minimal aggregation. The carboxyl-terminal sequence (residues 447–501) of HPV 11 L1 is shown in comparison with other HPV L1 types in Fig.2. This alignment was generated using the “FastA” and “Pileup” programs contained in Intelligenetics version 8.0 software (Genetics Computing Group Inc., Madison, WI). “FastA” was used to identify sequences similar to the complete HPV 11 L1 query sequence. Out of more than 50 hits, human sequences containing at least 64% amino acid identity are shown. The carboxyl terminus is fairly well conserved among HPV types and is characterized by a cluster of 6–8 basic amino acids within the final 15 residues and a shorter 3–4 basic amino acid cluster upstream from this. Eight of nine types contain the putative heparin-binding motif BBBXB where B is a basic residue (Lys or Arg). To explore the ability of HPV 11 L1 to interact with heparin, VLPs were applied to a column of immobilized heparin-Sepharose. Preliminary experiments showed that binding could be achieved at salt concentrations up to 0.5 m NaCl. The VLPs bound quantitatively as judged by the lack of a significant breakthrough peak. VLPs were eluted with porcine mucosal high molecular weight (HMW) heparin of average molecular mass ( Mr¯) 17,500 using a series of step gradients of increasing concentration. Pools collected during elution were analyzed by denaturing PAGE (Fig.3 A.). Approximately 93% of bound VLPs could be eluted with free heparin, with 60% eluting at 1.0 mg/ml heparin and an additional 33% being recovered at concentrations up to 10 mg/ml. The remaining 7% of applied protein was recovered in a 2 m NaCl strip of the resin and most likely represents aggregated species. VLPs could also be eluted from immobilized heparin using a linear NaCl gradient in which they eluted at approximately 0.8m NaCl (Fig. 3 B). The broadness and asymmetry of the chromatographic peak further indicates microheterogeneity with regard to affinity for the resin. All subsequent studies of inhibition of VLP binding were performed using NaCl gradient elution. A variety of compounds with structural similarities to heparin were tested as inhibitors of VLP binding by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. For these experiments, the concentration of VLPs was held constant while inhibitor concentration was varied. Mixtures of VLPs and inhibitor were held at 4 °C for various times (1–24 h) prior to analysis (data not shown). It was found that inhibition was relatively rapid, occurring within 1 h, but in order to ensure that equilibrium had been obtained, samples were typically incubated 16–20 h prior to chromatography. The total amount of p55 was calculated as the sum of retained and breakthrough peak areas, and recoveries were typically 90–95% that of control VLPs. This was done for each sample in order to account for slight variations in injection amount and recovery. The percent p55 bound was then calculated from the area of the retained peak with the same retention time as untreated controls (average of triplicate injections). The effect of various inhibitors is shown in Fig.4. Binding data were fit to two sigmoidal dose-response models and a one-site competition model. The best fits were achieved using a sigmoidal dose-response model with variable slope, and this was used to calculate IC50 values. Binding was inhibited by HMW heparin with a calculated IC50 of 14.9 μm. By contrast, a commercial low molecular weight (LMW) preparation ("

The molecular triggers for matrix production are still being defined. Here, suppression subtractive hybridization identified 15 genes differentially induced when primary human mesangial cells are exposed to high glucose (30 mm versus 5 mm) in vitro. These genes included (a) known regulators of mesangial cell activation in diabetic nephropathy (fibronectin, caldesmon, thrombospondin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), (b) novel genes, and (c) known genes whose induction by high glucose has not been reported. Prominent among the latter were genes encoding cytoskeleton-associated proteins and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a modulator of fibroblast matrix production. In parallel experiments, elevated CTGF mRNA levels were demonstrated in glomeruli of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy. Mannitol provoked less mesangial cell CTGF expression in vitro than high glucose, excluding hyperosmolality as the key stimulus. The addition of recombinant CTGF to cultured mesangial cells enhanced expression of extracellular matrix proteins. High glucose stimulated expression of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), and addition of TGF-β1 to mesangial cells triggered CTGF expression. CTGF expression induced by high glucose was partially suppressed by anti-TGF-β1 antibody and by the protein kinase C inhibitor GF 109203X. Together, these data suggest that 1) high glucose stimulates mesangial CTGF expression by TGFβ1-dependent and protein kinase C dependent pathways, and 2) CTGF may be a mediator of TGFβ1-driven matrix production within a diabetic milieu.

However, there is still very limited information on how they are activated by cell surface receptors. Here, we used a consensus sequence for Dbl domains of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) to search DNA data bases, and identified a novel human GEF for Rho-related GTPases harboring structural features indicative of its possible regulatory mechanism(s). This protein contained a tandem DH/PH domain closely related to those of Rho-specific GEFs, a PDZ domain, a proline-rich domain, and an area of homology to Lsc, p115-RhoGEF, and a Drosophila RhoGEF that was termed Lsc-homology (LH) domain. This novel molecule, designated PDZ-RhoGEF, activated biological and biochemical pathways specific for Rho, and activation of these pathways required an intact DH and PH domain. However, the PDZ domain was dispensable for these functions, and mutants lacking the LH domain were more active, suggesting a negative regulatory role for the LH domain. A search for additional molecules exhibiting an LH domain revealed a limited homology with the catalytic region of a newly identified GTPase-activating protein for heterotrimeric G proteins, RGS14. This prompted us to investigate whether PDZ-RhoGEF could interact with representative members of each G protein family. We found that PDZ-RhoGEF was able to form, in vivo, stable complexes with two members of the Gα12 family, Gα12 and Gα13, and that this interaction was mediated by the LH domain. Furthermore, we obtained evidence to suggest that PDZ-RhoGEF mediates the activation of Rho by Gα12 and Gα13.

Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar, 2Boguski M.S. McCormick F.

Whereas the Rab, Arf, and Sar groups participate in the transport of proteins and vesicles among different intracellular compartments, the Ran proteins function in nuclear transport, and Ras plays a central role in cell proliferation and differentiation (2Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar,4Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). In the case of Ras, recent studies have revealed how it works at the molecular level. This small GTP-binding protein exchanges GDP for GTP upon activation of Ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 (5Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and in the GTP-bound state, Ras physically associates with Raf (6Marshall M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) thereby recruiting this serine threonine kinase to the plasma membrane. This causes the activation of Raf and initiates the activity of a sequential cascade of kinases leading to the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), p42MAPK and p44MAPK, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases-2 and -1, respectively, which, in turn, control the activity of nuclear transcription factors that are critical for cell growth (7Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3188) Google Scholar).The Rho family of GTP-binding proteins, which consists of the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 subfamilies, has been shown to regulate several aspects of cytoskeleton function (4Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). For example, Rho participates in the formation of actin stress fibers and mediates the redistribution of cytoskeletal components (4Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 9Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). Rac is involved in the regulation of lamellipodia (pleat-shaped protrusions at the cell periphery) and membrane ruffling (10Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar); and Cdc42 regulates the formation of thin finger-like cytoplasmic extensions known as filopodia (11Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). These proteins play an important role in the regulation of cell morphology, cell aggregation, tissue polarity, cytokinesis, cell motility, and also in smooth muscle contraction (12Hotchin N.A. Hall A. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 311-322PubMed Google Scholar, 13Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 14Narumiya S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence suggests that Rho proteins are also integral components of signaling pathways leading to transcriptional control. For example, Rac and Cdc42 regulate the activity of the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) thereby affecting the transcriptional activity of c-Jun (15Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar), and Rho has been recently shown to induce expression from the serum responsive element (SRE) through the transcriptional activation of the serum response factor (SRF) (16Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar).The functional activity of small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily is tightly regulated in vivo by proteins that control their GDP/GTP bound state. Whereas GEFs promote the exchange of GDP for GTP thus activating Ras-like proteins (2Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar), GTPase-activating proteins increase the low intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis of small GTPases (reviewed in Ref. 3Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and are negative modulators. The mechanisms of activation of GEFs for Ras by cell surface receptors have been intensely investigated. For example, the biochemical route connecting the epidermal growth factor-receptor tyrosine kinase to Ras has been recently identified (5Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 17Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar), and includes the phosphorylation of the receptor itself on tyrosine residues, thus creating docking sites for adapter molecules such as Grb2 and Crk. These adapter molecules, in turn, help recruit to the membrane Sos, a Ras-GEF, thereby inducing the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras. In contrast, the signaling pathway regulating the activity of GEFs for Rho family members is still poorly understood.Many GEFs for Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, including dbl,ost, lfc, lbc, vav,ect2, tim, and net (reviewed in Refs.18Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar and 19Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar) were discovered by virtue of their ability to transform NIH 3T3 cells when overexpressed or when activated by truncations. All these proteins share a 250-amino acid stretch of significant sequence similarity with Dbl, termed Dbl homology (DH) domain, adjacent to a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain (18Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 19Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). The DH domain was shown to be responsible for nucleotide exchange activity toward GTPases of the Rho family (20Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Of interest, one of these GEFs for Rho-like proteins, the protein product of the vav proto-oncogene, proto-Vav, also exhibits a Src homology (SH) 2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains (22Margolis B. Hu P. Katzav S. Li W. Oliver J.M. Ullrich A. Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 356: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 23Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Science. 1992; 256: 1196-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and we have recently shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of proto-Vav by hematopoietic specific tyrosine kinases can activate its GEF activity for Rac both in vitro and in vivo(24Teramoto H. Salem P. Robbins K.C. Bustelo X.R. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10751-10755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 25Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). However, no other GEF for Rho-like proteins has been found to be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, nor to contain a phosphotyrosine-binding domain such as an SH2 or PTB domains. Furthermore, the vast majority of the known GEFs for small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family are expressed in a very restricted tissue-specific manner (18Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 19Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar), and their mechanism of activation is still largely unknown.In this study, we explored the existence of novel GEFs for Rho-like proteins possessing structural domains that might suggest a role in signal transduction. Here, we report the identification of a novel, ubiquitously expressed GEF for Rho-like proteins containing a PDZ domain. This protein, termed PDZ-RhoGEF, was found to activate biochemical pathways specific for Rho, in a Rho-dependent manner. Interestingly, PDZ-RhoGEF was found to be closely related to the Drosophila DRhoGEF2, and recent genetic analysis suggests that DRhoGEF2 acts downstream of the concertinagene, a Drosophila Gα12 homolog. Here, we found that PDZ-RhoGEF physically associates in vivo with activated α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins of the G12 family, Gα12 and Gα13. Association was found to occur through a novel structural domain, termed Lsc homology (LH) domain, located between the PDZ and the DH domain, and also present in the NH2-terminal, regulatory domain of the lscproto-oncogene product and its human homolog, p115-RhoGEF. This LH domain is distantly related to the G protein-binding region of a family of proteins known as regulators of G proteinsignaling (RGSs) (26Snow B.E. Antonio L. Suggs S. Gutstein H.B. Siderovski D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Together, our present findings suggest the existence of a novel pathway by which the large family of G protein-coupled receptors communicates to Rho through the activation of G12/G13 and the physical association between Gα12 or Gα13 with LH containing GEFs for Rho, thereby stimulating Rho-dependent pathways.DISCUSSIONAlthough small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family play a critical role in a variety of cellular functions, including the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and the activity of biochemical routes regulating gene expression and cell growth, how these GTPases are activated by cell surface receptors is still largely unknown. Thus, we investigated whether novel exchange factors for Rho-related GTPases might exist, exhibiting functional domains suggestive of a role in signal transduction. For this, we took advantage of the observation that all known GEFs for Rho proteins exhibit a DH domain, a 250-amino acid stretch of significant sequence similarity to Dbl, a transforming protein that was originally isolated from a diffuse B cell lymphoma (46Srivastava S.K. Wheelock R.H. Aaronson S.A. Eva A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8868-8872Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Using a consensus sequence for DH domains of Rho-exchange factors (2Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar) to search DNA data bases, we identified a yet uncharacterized molecule exhibiting a putative DH domain. Detailed analysis of its primary sequence revealed that this molecule contained additional areas of similarity with known modular domains, including a PH domain, a PDZ domain, a proline-rich region, and an area of homology to p115-RhoGEF, DRhoGEF2 and Lsc, that was not found in any other GEF described so far, and that was termed LH domain. As many of these protein regions are likely candidates to participate in signal transmission, we decided to investigate further this novel putative exchange factor.When the DH domain of this new molecule was compared with those of other DH containing proteins, we found that it was highly related to that of two Rho-specific GEFs, p115-RhoGEF (30Hart M.J.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, PDZ-RhoGEF was more distantly related to the DH domain of exchange factors activating Rac1 and/or Cdc42 such as Tiam1 (47Habets G.G. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Michiels F. Collard J.G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1371-1376PubMed Google Scholar), Vav (48Bustelo X.R. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 65-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), Ost (49Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and Dbl (46Srivastava S.K. Wheelock R.H. Aaronson S.A. Eva A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8868-8872Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and to those acting on Ras, including Sos (50Bonfini L. Karlovich C.A. Dasgupta C. Banerjee U. Science. 1992; 255: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and Ras-GRF (51Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, expression of epitope-tagged forms of this novel GEF did not elevate the activity of co-transfected HA-tagged forms of MAPK and JNK, but potently stimulated the transcriptional activity of SRF, as judged by the use of a reporter plasmid under the control of a mutated SRE (16Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Furthermore, experiments with the use of botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Rho, and an inactivation resistant form of Rho, RhoI41, indicated that the enhanced expression from the SRE-driven plasmid was dependent on the availability of a functional Rho. In addition, we have recently observed that expression of this molecule in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells potently induces the formation of actin stress fibers, to an extent comparable to that caused by expressing activated forms of Rho. 2M. Zohar and J. S. Gutkind, unpublished data. Thus, taken together, the primary sequence similarity with Rho GEFs and these biochemical profiles strongly suggest that this novel DH-containing molecule, that was designated PDZ-RhoGEF, can stimulate in vivoRho-specific pathways.In addition to the DH domain, a PH domain is present in all GEFs for Rho-related proteins described so far, located adjacent to the carboxyl end of the DH domain (18Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). PH domains are found in a wide variety of signaling molecules (52Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and have been implicated in both protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions (53Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Although a DH domain is necessary and sufficient for the exchange activity on Rho proteins in vitro (20Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the integrity of the PH domain is required for the activity in vivo of this family of exchange factors (31Whitehead I.P. Khosravi-Far R. Kirk H. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Der C.J. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) most likely by facilitating membrane translocation (31Whitehead I.P. Khosravi-Far R. Kirk H. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Der C.J. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consistent with those observations, deletion of the DH domain, PH domain, or DH/PH domains abolished the biochemical activity of PDZ-RhoGEF. Similarly, PDZ-RhoGEF readily induced the appearance of foci of transformation when expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, and this activity required the presence of an intact DH and PH domain (data not shown), supporting a critical role for the DH and PH domains for the functional activity of PDZ-RhoGEF.The most striking feature of this novel exchange factor was the presence of a PDZ domain, a protein-protein interaction domain originally identified as an area of homology between the product of theDrosophila dlg tumor suppresor gene and the synaptic protein PSD-95 (54Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar), currently found in more than 60 distinct gene products (35Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These domains can either bind specific recognition sequences such as the (S/T)XV motif at the carboxyl termini of certain proteins, or they can form hetero- or homodimers, suggesting that this modular protein-binding domain can participate in the formation of macromolecular complexes (35Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thus, the PDZ domain was expected to contribute to PDZ-RhoGEF function. Surprisingly, however, when this domain was deleted, we did not observe any demonstrable effect on the ability of PDZ-RhoGEF to induce Rho-dependent pathways. Similarly, deletion of the PDZ domain was shown not to affect the biological activities of the Rac1 exchange factor Tiam1 (55Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Although, based on these results, we cannot rule out the possibility that the PDZ domain facilitates the interaction of PDZ-RhoGEF and other exchange factors with yet to be identified signaling molecules (see below), we therefore decided to focus our efforts on other putative functional domains. One such interesting domain is a stretch of 197 amino acids located upstream from the DH domain, that was termed LH domain forLsc homology domain, and that is also found in Lsc, p115-RhoGEF, and DRhoGEF2 but not in any other GEF. This suggests that the LH domain represents a distinctive feature of this subgroup of exchange factors, which might bear functional relevance. Indeed, deletion of the LH domain enhanced the ability of PDZ-RhoGEF to stimulate SRE, to an extent comparable to that of a truncation mutant lacking the entire NH2-terminal regulatory region. Similarly, we found that NH2-terminal truncated or LH-deleted forms of PDZ-RhoGEF exhibit enhanced focus forming activity in NIH 3T3 cells when compared with the wild-type form. 3S. Fukuhara and J. S. Gutkind, unpublished results. Thus, PDZ-RhoGEF, like other GEFs, appears to be negatively regulated by inhibitory sequences within the non-catalytic region (18Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and this inhibitory function most likely resides in the LH domain.Because of the possibility that the LH domain might have a regulatory function, we searched data bases for molecules displaying sequences related to the LH domain. Surprisingly, we found that the catalytic region of a recently described GTPase-activating proteins for heterotrimeric G proteins, RGS14, exhibited a limited sequence similarity to the LH domain. RGSs were initially identified as homologues of Sst2 proteins, which are negative regulators of pheromone signaling in yeast (56Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). This protein family, currently with 19 members, shares a 120-amino acid core, termed GH domain, which is essential for accelerating the rate of GTP hydrolysis on Gα proteins (56Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). RGS14, together with RGS12, represent novel members of this family, characterized for being substantially larger (∼60 and ∼140 kDa, respectively) than the majority of the other known RGSs (∼25 kDa) (26Snow B.E. Antonio L. Suggs S. Gutstein H.B. Siderovski D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This data suggested that the LH domain might confer to PDZ-RhoGEF the ability to interact with G protein α subunits. Indeed, we found that PDZ-RhoGEF could form stable complexes in vivospecifically with members of the G12 family of G protein α subunits, Gα12 and Gα13, and that this interaction required the presence of an intact LH domain. Taken together, we can conclude that PDZ-RhoGEF can interact physically with a particular subset of Gα proteins, thereby providing a direct link between hetereotrimeric G proteins and small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family.These findings may have important implications regarding the function of G proteins of the G12 family, Gα12 and Gα13. These ubiquitously expressed G proteins were discovered by M. Simon's group upon amplification of mouse brain cDNA by polymerase chain reaction using degenerated oligonucleotides corresponding to regions highly conserved among G proteins (57Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5582-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Gα12 and Gα13 exhibit 67% amino acid identity with each other, but only 35–44% of amino acid identity to α subunits of other classes, such as Gq,Gi, and Gs (57Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5582-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Furthermore, whereas members of the Gαq family of G proteins activate phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipases, the Gαsfamily stimulate adenylyl cyclases, and Gαi inhibits adenylyl cyclases and activate certain phosphodiesterases and promote the opening of several ion channels (58Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 59Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Res. 1995; 15: 213-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), members of the Gα12 family of GTPases appear not to affect any of these second messenger-generating systems (60Birnbaumer L. Birnbaumer M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1995; 15: 213-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this regard, the finding that concertina (cta), a Drosophilagene involved in embryogenesis (41Parks S. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1991; 64: 447-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and that Gα12 and Gα13 can behave as remarkably potent oncogenes (29Xu N. Bradley L. Ambdukar I. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6741-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 42Xu N. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Gutkind J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), provided early indications that this G protein class might be involved in growth regulation, albeit through poorly defined mechanisms. Intense investigation in many laboratories has recently generated a wealth of information on how Gα12 and Gα13 may act (see Ref. 61Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell Signal. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, for a recent review). In particular, one such study (62Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) demonstrated that activated Gα12 and Gα13, but not Gαi2 and Gαq or different combinations of β and γ subunits, mimicked the effect of activated RhoA on stress fibers and focal adhesion assembly, and we have recently provided evidence that Gα12 stimulates nuclear responses and cellular transformation through Rho (27Fromm C.

Furthermore, several studies have now provided evidence that members of the G12family of G proteins link many G protein-coupled receptors, including receptors for lysophosphatidic acid, thrombin, thromboxane A2, and acetylcholine to the activation of Rho-dependent pathways and, in many cases, cell growth control (27Fromm C.

The ability of Gcn5 to acetylate nucleosomal histones is significantly reduced relative to its activity on free histones, where it predominantly modifies histone H3 at lysine 14. However, the association of Gcn5 in multisubunit complexes potentiates its nucleosomal histone acetyltransferase activity. Here, we show that the association of Gcn5 with other proteins in two native yeast complexes, Ada and SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase), directly confers upon Gcn5 the ability to acetylate an expanded set of lysines on H3. Furthermore Ada and SAGA have overlapping, yet distinct, patterns of acetylation, suggesting that the association of specific subunits determines site specificity.

The nucleosome core particle contains about 146 base pairs of DNA and two of each of the histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Packaging of DNA into chromatin suppresses transcription, at least in part by occluding the binding of transcriptional activators and basal transcription machinery to their cognate DNA sites (1Owen-Hughes T.A.

Cell. 1998; 92: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). A number of chromatin remodeling activities have been isolated that assist activators to bind to their sites by promoting a localized alteration in chromatin structure (4Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar).In addition to these activities, post-translational modifications of the core histones within the nucleosome have also been linked to the transcriptional capacity of chromatin (5Turner B.M.

The acetylation of the highly conserved lysine residues within the amino-terminal domains of all four core histones has been extensively studied (7Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation has been associated with the interaction of non-histone proteins with histones (8Hecht A. Laroche T.

Correlations between transcription and acetylation are reinforced by studies demonstrating that at least some active chromosomal domains are hyperacetylated (14Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), while inactive or heterochromatin domains are associated with hypoacetylated histones (15Turner B.M.

However these general correlations do not hold true when specific acetylated H4 isoforms are monitored indicating that particular patterns of lysine acetylation rather than bulk acetylation is of functional importance (15Turner B.M. Birley A.J. Lavender J. Cell. 1992; 69: 375-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 19Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Suka N. Turner B.M. Grunstein M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, an important goal in studying this phenomenon has been the isolation of native activities that generate such specific patterns of acetylation.The steady state level of acetylation of histones is a balance between the action of histone acetyltransferases (HATs)1 and histone deacetylases. These activities are often found to be associated with large multisubunit protein complexes and contain known regulators of transcription (21Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). A number of previously characterized transcriptional coactivators have also been shown to possess HAT activity, providing a direct molecular link between histone acetylation and gene activation (22Wade P.A.

Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Gcn5 also functions in additional multisubunit HAT complexes in yeast (27Saleh A. Lang V. Cook R. Brandl C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5571-5578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 35Ruiz-Garcia A.B. Sendra R. Pamblanco M. Tordera V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In vitro and in vivostudies indicate that both the SAGA and Ada complexes can promote acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)-dependent transcriptional activation from nucleosomal templates (29Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 30Kuo M.-H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E.A. Allis C.D.

A. 1998; 95: 12924-12929Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Initial studies using recombinant Gcn5 indicated that it displays a nonrandom specificity for acetylation of lysines, predominantly acetylating histone H3 at lysine 14 (31Kuo M.-H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In vivo, acetylation of H3 can occur at lysines 9, 14, 18, and 23. Since acetylation of lysine 9 of H3 is associated with histone deposition, it has been suggested that acetylation of other sites may be associated with transcription (10Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 31Kuo M.-H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated the histone H3 lysine acetylation specificity of the native Gcn5-dependent HAT complexes Ada and SAGA in comparison with recombinant Gcn5 (rGcn5). We used a combination of Western blotting, peptide assays, and microsequencing analysis to determine the sites of acetylation for the Gcn5-dependent Ada and SAGA complexes. We show that while rGcn5 acetylates only lysine 14, purified Ada complex acetylates both lysines 14 and 18, and SAGA acetylates to some extent all four lysines in H3. Using mutant variants of Gcn5, we show that this acetylation pattern is dependent on Gcn5 function and not other putative HAT activities within these complexes. These results indicate that the association of Gcn5 with different proteins in multisubunit complexes endows upon it an expanded substrate specificity.DISCUSSIONThe transcriptional adaptor Gcn5 was originally demonstrated to be a histone acetyltransferase with a nonrandom pattern of acetylation, predominantly modifying H3 at Lys-14 in vitro (31Kuo M.-H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Very recently, rGcn5 has also been shown to monoacetylate nucleosomal H3 at lysine 14, albeit less efficiently than free histones, using optimum NaCl or MgCl2 concentrations (32Tse C. Georgieva E.I. Ruiz-Garcia A.B. Sendra R. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32388-32392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the association of Gcn5 in high molecular weight multiprotein complexes potentiates its nucleosomal histone acetyltransferase activity (33Grant P.A. Duggan L. Côté J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 34Pollard K.J. Peterson C.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24414-24419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown in this study that this association also directly endows upon Gcn5 an expanded lysine specificity. The Gcn5-dependent complex Ada preferentially acetylates Lys-14 > Lys-18, while SAGA acetylates Lys-14 > Lys-18 > Lys-9 = Lys-23 on synthetic H3 peptide substrates and on nucleosomal H3. These results indicate that Gcn5 generates a context-dependent acetylation pattern as a consequence of its association with other factors. The Ada and SAGA complexes share at least a few common components, namely Gcn5, Ada2, and Ada3. However the SAGA complex is distinguished from the Ada complex by the fact that it additionally contains Spt proteins (33Grant P.A. Duggan L. Côté J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) and a subset of TAFII proteins (37Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yates III, J.R. Workman J.L. Cell. 1998; 94: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Gcn5 is also associated in other apparently distinct HAT complexes (27Saleh A. Lang V. Cook R. Brandl C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5571-5578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Pollard K.J. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell.

These findings have suggested that these multiple Gcn5-dependent HAT complexes may serve distinct roles in yeast transcriptional regulation (23Grant P.A. Sterner D.E. Duggan L.J. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Trends in Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 193-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that individual Gcn5-containing complexes may generate overlapping, yet distinct patterns of nucleosomal acetylation, which may signal a specific function. In this scenario, the components unique to each complex are likely to determine the target lysines acetylated by Gcn5.We have recently demonstrated that purified native yeast HAT complexes, including Ada, and SAGA can promote transcription in an acetyl-CoA-dependent fashion in vitro (38Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Workman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12924-12929Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 45Utley R.T. Ikeda K. Grant P.A. Côté J. Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Workman J.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). These results are reinforced by additional in vitro andin vivo data demonstrating a requirement for Gcn5-directed HAT activity for promoter acetylation and transcriptional activation (29Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 30Kuo M.-H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E.A. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Since Gcn5 is a transcriptional adaptor protein, it was originally inferred that the modification of Lys-14 by rGcn5 represents a transcription linked acetylation pattern, distinct from the predominant mapped deposition-related acetylation site of Lys-9 in yeast (31Kuo M.-H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 46Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. Sherman F. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that the SAGA complex acetylates all four lysines including Lys-9, thereby linking lysines other than Lys-14 in transcriptional activation. We demonstrate that Gcn5 contained in native type A HAT complexes can generate acetylation patterns on H3 at least, which overlap with those generated by type B histone acetyltransferases for histone deposition and chromatin assembly (10Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Therefore, transcription-linked acetylation does not simply involve acetylation of Lys-14 on H3, but may encompass a variety of lysine modifications. However, a common theme between both native HAT Gcn5 complexes and rGcn5 used in this study is the acetylation of Lys-14. This may indicate a pivotal role for this lysine in the Gcn5-dependent regulation of transcription.A recent study examined the function of histone acetylation in vivo by mutation of target lysines in yeast strains with and without a functional GCN5 gene. The authors found that Gcn5 was required for full levels of acetylation at multiple sites in H3 and H4in vivo (47Zhang W. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In particular Gcn5 is directly or indirectly required for acetylation of H3 Lys-9 and H3 Lys-18 in vivo, while mutation of Lys-14 in gcn5Δ cells conferred a strong synthetic growth defect. Our results provide a direct molecular explanation for these observations, in that native Gcn5-containing HAT complexes, such as SAGA and Ada, can acetylate multiple H3 lysines. The Gcn5-dependent acetylation events are important for normal progression of the cell cycle and for transcriptional activation (29Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar,47Zhang W. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a critical level of histone acetylation is essential for cell viability (47Zhang W. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Interestingly a study by Thompson et al. (48Thompson J.S. Ling X. Grunstein M. Nature. 1994; 369: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) has shown that histone H3 is required for full repression at yeast telomeres and silent mating loci and that the acetylatable lysines of H3 play an important role in silencing. While single-site mutations at H3 lysines 9 or 14 had little effect on telomeric repression, substitution of 3 or 4 lysines simultaneously resulted in strong telomeric derepression. This result suggested that a number of modified lysines in H3 may be required for derepression (48Thompson J.S. Ling X. Grunstein M. Nature. 1994; 369: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that such a function could be provided by expanded lysine specificity of Gcn5 contained within native HAT complexes. In the eukaryotic nucleus DNA is packaged by histones into nucleosomes, the repeating subunits of chromatin. The nucleosome core particle contains about 146 base pairs of DNA and two of each of the histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Packaging of DNA into chromatin suppresses transcription, at least in part by occluding the binding of transcriptional activators and basal transcription machinery to their cognate DNA sites (1Owen-Hughes T.A. Workman J.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 403-441PubMed Google Scholar, 2Paranjape S.M. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 265-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and by blocking transcriptional elongation (3Orphanides O. LeRoy G. Chang C.-H. Luse D.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 92: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). A number of chromatin remodeling activities have been isolated that assist activators to bind to their sites by promoting a localized alteration in chromatin structure (4Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). In addition to these activities, post-translational modifications of the core histones within the nucleosome have also been linked to the transcriptional capacity of chromatin (5Turner B.M. O'Neill L.P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Bradbury E.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The acetylation of the highly conserved lysine residues within the amino-terminal domains of all four core histones has been extensively studied (7Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation has been associated with the interaction of non-histone proteins with histones (8Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 9Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), histone deposition and nucleosome assembly (10Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), higher order packing of chromatin (11Fletcher T.M. Hanson J.C. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 149-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 12Hendzel M.J. Kruhlak M.J. Bazett-Jones D.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2491-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the transcriptional activity of cellular chromatin (5Turner B.M. O'Neill L.P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 13Turner B.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Correlations between transcription and acetylation are reinforced by studies demonstrating that at least some active chromosomal domains are hyperacetylated (14Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), while inactive or heterochromatin domains are associated with hypoacetylated histones (15Turner B.M. Birley A.J. Lavender J. Cell. 1992; 69: 375-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 16Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 17Jeppesen P. Turner B.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 281-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 18O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3946-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However these general correlations do not hold true when specific acetylated H4 isoforms are monitored indicating that particular patterns of lysine acetylation rather than bulk acetylation is of functional importance (15Turner B.M. Birley A.J. Lavender J. Cell. 1992; 69: 375-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 19Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Suka N. Turner B.M. Grunstein M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, an important goal in studying this phenomenon has been the isolation of native activities that generate such specific patterns of acetylation. The steady state level of acetylation of histones is a balance between the action of histone acetyltransferases (HATs)1 and histone deacetylases. These activities are often found to be associated with large multisubunit protein complexes and contain known regulators of transcription (21Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). A number of previously characterized transcriptional coactivators have also been shown to possess HAT activity, providing a direct molecular link between histone acetylation and gene activation (22Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 23Grant P.A. Sterner D.E. Duggan L.J. Workman J.L. Berger S.L.

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the coactivator/adaptor protein Gcn5 is involved in the regulation of various genes (24Georgakopoulos T. Thireos G.

Gcn5 requires acetyltransferase function for both promoter-directed histone acetylation and Gcn5-mediated transcriptional activation in vivo (29Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L.

However, the association of Gcn5 with other proteins in large multisubunit complexes in yeast potentiates its nucleosomal acetyltransferase activity (33Grant P.A. Duggan L. Côté J. Roberts S.M.

The 1.8-MDa SAGA complex is a Gcn5-dependent HAT activity, which contains at least three distinct groups of gene products (23Grant P.A. Sterner D.E. Duggan L.J. Workman J.L. Berger S.L.

The first of these are the Ada proteins Gcn5 (Ada4), Ada1, Ada2, Ada3, and Ada5 (Spt20), isolated as proteins that interact functionally with the transcription factor Gcn4 and the activation domain derived from the herpes simplex virus activator VP16. The second group comprises all members of the TBP-related set of Spt proteins, Spt3, Spt7, Spt8, and Spt20 (Ada5), except TBP (Spt15), which were isolated as suppressers of transcription initiation defects caused by promoter insertions of the transposable element Ty. The third group within SAGA includes a subset of TBP-associated factors, TAFIIs, including TAFII90, TAFII68/61, TAFII60, TAFII25/23, and TAFII20/17 (37Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G.

A second Gcn5-dependent HAT activity, which we named Ada, has been isolated as a 0.8-MDa multisubunit complex containing the Ada proteins Gcn5, Ada2, and Ada3. However, the Ada complex does not contain the other Ada proteins or the Spt or TAFII proteins found in SAGA (33Grant P.A. Duggan L. Côté J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Gcn5 also functions in additional multisubunit HAT complexes in yeast (27Saleh A. Lang V. Cook R. Brandl C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5571-5578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 35Ruiz-Garcia A.B. Sendra R. Pamblanco M. Tordera V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In vitro and in vivostudies indicate that both the SAGA and Ada complexes can promote acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)-dependent transcriptional activation from nucleosomal templates (29Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 30Kuo M.-H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E.A. Allis C.D.

A. 1998; 95: 12924-12929Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Initial studies using recombinant Gcn5 indicated that it displays a nonrandom specificity for acetylation of lysines, predominantly acetylating histone H3 at lysine 14 (31Kuo M.-H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In vivo, acetylation of H3 can occur at lysines 9, 14, 18, and 23. Since acetylation of lysine 9 of H3 is associated with histone deposition, it has been suggested that acetylation of other sites may be associated with transcription (10Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 31Kuo M.-H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated the histone H3 lysine acetylation specificity of the native Gcn5-dependent HAT complexes Ada and SAGA in comparison with recombinant Gcn5 (rGcn5). We used a combination of Western blotting, peptide assays, and microsequencing analysis to determine the sites of acetylation for the Gcn5-dependent Ada and SAGA complexes. We show that while rGcn5 acetylates only lysine 14, purified Ada complex acetylates both lysines 14 and 18, and SAGA acetylates to some extent all four lysines in H3. Using mutant variants of Gcn5, we show that this acetylation pattern is dependent on Gcn5 function and not other putative HAT activities within these complexes. These results indicate that the association of Gcn5 with different proteins in multisubunit complexes endows upon it an expanded substrate specificity. DISCUSSIONThe transcriptional adaptor Gcn5 was originally demonstrated to be a histone acetyltransferase with a nonrandom pattern of acetylation, predominantly modifying H3 at Lys-14 in vitro (31Kuo M.-H.

Very recently, rGcn5 has also been shown to monoacetylate nucleosomal H3 at lysine 14, albeit less efficiently than free histones, using optimum NaCl or MgCl2 concentrations (32Tse C. Georgieva E.I.

However, the association of Gcn5 in high molecular weight multiprotein complexes potentiates its nucleosomal histone acetyltransferase activity (33Grant P.A. Duggan L. Côté J. Roberts S.M.

In addition, we have shown in this study that this association also directly endows upon Gcn5 an expanded lysine specificity. The Gcn5-dependent complex Ada preferentially acetylates Lys-14 > Lys-18, while SAGA acetylates Lys-14 > Lys-18 > Lys-9 = Lys-23 on synthetic H3 peptide substrates and on nucleosomal H3. These results indicate that Gcn5 generates a context-dependent acetylation pattern as a consequence of its association with other factors. The Ada and SAGA complexes share at least a few common components, namely Gcn5, Ada2, and Ada3. However the SAGA complex is distinguished from the Ada complex by the fact that it additionally contains Spt proteins (33Grant P.A. Duggan L. Côté J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) and a subset of TAFII proteins (37Grant P.A. Schieltz D.

Gcn5 is also associated in other apparently distinct HAT complexes (27Saleh A. Lang V. Cook R. Brandl C.J. J. Biol.

These findings have suggested that these multiple Gcn5-dependent HAT complexes may serve distinct roles in yeast transcriptional regulation (23Grant P.A. Sterner D.E. Duggan L.J. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Trends in Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 193-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that individual Gcn5-containing complexes may generate overlapping, yet distinct patterns of nucleosomal acetylation, which may signal a specific function. In this scenario, the components unique to each complex are likely to determine the target lysines acetylated by Gcn5.We have recently demonstrated that purified native yeast HAT complexes, including Ada, and SAGA can promote transcription in an acetyl-CoA-dependent fashion in vitro (38Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Workman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12924-12929Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 45Utley R.T. Ikeda K. Grant P.A. Côté J. Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Workman J.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). These results are reinforced by additional in vitro andin vivo data demonstrating a requirement for Gcn5-directed HAT activity for promoter acetylation and transcriptional activation (29Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 30Kuo M.-H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E.A. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Since Gcn5 is a transcriptional adaptor protein, it was originally inferred that the modification of Lys-14 by rGcn5 represents a transcription linked acetylation pattern, distinct from the predominant mapped deposition-related acetylation site of Lys-9 in yeast (31Kuo M.-H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 46Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P.

However, our data suggest that the SAGA complex acetylates all four lysines including Lys-9, thereby linking lysines other than Lys-14 in transcriptional activation. We demonstrate that Gcn5 contained in native type A HAT complexes can generate acetylation patterns on H3 at least, which overlap with those generated by type B histone acetyltransferases for histone deposition and chromatin assembly (10Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Therefore, transcription-linked acetylation does not simply involve acetylation of Lys-14 on H3, but may encompass a variety of lysine modifications. However, a common theme between both native HAT Gcn5 complexes and rGcn5 used in this study is the acetylation of Lys-14. This may indicate a pivotal role for this lysine in the Gcn5-dependent regulation of transcription.A recent study examined the function of histone acetylation in vivo by mutation of target lysines in yeast strains with and without a functional GCN5 gene. The authors found that Gcn5 was required for full levels of acetylation at multiple sites in H3 and H4in vivo (47Zhang W. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In particular Gcn5 is directly or indirectly required for acetylation of H3 Lys-9 and H3 Lys-18 in vivo, while mutation of Lys-14 in gcn5Δ cells conferred a strong synthetic growth defect. Our results provide a direct molecular explanation for these observations, in that native Gcn5-containing HAT complexes, such as SAGA and Ada, can acetylate multiple H3 lysines. The Gcn5-dependent acetylation events are important for normal progression of the cell cycle and for transcriptional activation (29Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar,47Zhang W. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a critical level of histone acetylation is essential for cell viability (47Zhang W. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Interestingly a study by Thompson et al. (48Thompson J.S. Ling X. Grunstein M. Nature. 1994; 369: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) has shown that histone H3 is required for full repression at yeast telomeres and silent mating loci and that the acetylatable lysines of H3 play an important role in silencing. While single-site mutations at H3 lysines 9 or 14 had little effect on telomeric repression, substitution of 3 or 4 lysines simultaneously resulted in strong telomeric derepression. This result suggested that a number of modified lysines in H3 may be required for derepression (48Thompson J.S. Ling X. Grunstein M. Nature. 1994; 369: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that such a function could be provided by expanded lysine specificity of Gcn5 contained within native HAT complexes. The transcriptional adaptor Gcn5 was originally demonstrated to be a histone acetyltransferase with a nonrandom pattern of acetylation, predominantly modifying H3 at Lys-14 in vitro (31Kuo M.-H.

The mechansim of protein release has not been established. One proposal is that protein release requires rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane and that this is a consequence of the onset of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)1 (9Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 10Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Onset of the MPT, which is an inner membrane process, would depolarize the inner membrane (11Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Thus, the MPT hypothesis implies a direct temporal relationship between mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release. Experimental data addressing this connection are limited. Actually, two recent studies showed that cytochrome crelease during apoptosis was not accompanied by mitochondrial depolarization (12Yang J.

In these studies, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) was monitored by rhodamine 123 and DiOC6, compounds that are known to inhibit the ATP synthase and mitochondrial respiration (14Emaus R.K.

To examine the temporal relationship between cytochrome crelease and mitochondrial depolarization, we set out to monitor these events in the individual mitochondria of single cells undergoing apoptosis. To monitor mitochondrial Δψ, we used tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM). TMRM has no apparent effect on metabolism, and it distributes into mitochondria in response to membrane potential without covalent binding (20Ehrenberg B. Montana V. Wei M.D. Wuskell J.P. Loew L.M. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). To monitor cytochrome c, we made a cytochromec-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct for transfection so that release of cytochrome c could be observed in individual mitochondria by confocal microscopy (21Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Zang W. Balke C.W. Takeshima H. Wier W.G. Ma J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the present report we show that mitochondrial depolarization is accompanied by cytochrome c release in staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Full-length cDNA sequence of rat cytochrome c was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction amplification using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and cloned into NheI and XhoI sites of the pEGFP-N1 plasmid (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Polymerase chain reaction was performed using oligonucleotide primers designed to introduce the KOZAK sequence and remove the stop codon of cytochrome c. The KOZAK sequence of the GFP in pEGFP-N1 was removed to ensure expression of only the cytochrome c-GFP fusion protein. Rat pheochromocytoma-6 (PC6) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 15 mm HEPES, 4 mm glutamine, 17.5 mm glucose, heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, and penicillin/streptomycin. For transfection, cells (4 × 105) were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 40-mm glass coverslips. One day later, cells were transiently transfected using 4 μg of plasmid DNA (cytochrome c-GFP or GFP) and 24 μl of cationic lipid Lipofect- AMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 2 ml of serum free Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) per coverslip. After 3 h, an equal volume of regular medium containing 2× normal serum was added. After 1 day, the cells were placed in normal growth medium without antibiotics. Immunoblots were performed as described before (21Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Zang W. Balke C.W. Takeshima H. Wier W.G. Ma J. J. Gen.

PC6 cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors (0.2 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer. Forty μg of protein each of nontransfected cells and cytochrome c-GFP transfected cells, and 1 μg of protein of GFP were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and blotted with primary monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH) and secondary anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA). Peroxidase activity was developed with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To investigate localization of GFP and GFP-fusion proteins, cells were transferred to a mounting chamber on the microscope stage in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 15 mm HEPES and 5% fetal bovine serum at pH 7.2 after 66 h of transfection. Subsequently, cells were loaded with 40 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (23Poot M. Zhang Y.Z. Kramer J.A. Wells K.S. Jones L.J. Hanzel D.K. Lugade A.G. Singer V.L. Haugland R.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) for 15 min in culture medium. A 63X N.A. 1.4 oil immersion planapochromat objective with a Zeiss 410 confocal microscope (Thornwood, NY) was used for all experiments. Confocal images of green cytochrome c-GFP and GFP fluorescence were collected using 488 nm excitation light from an argon/krypton laser, a 560-nm dichroic mirror and a 500–550-nm band pass barrier filter. Images of red MitoTrackerRed CMXRos fluorescence were collected using a 568-nm excitation light from the argon/krypton laser, a 560-nm dichroic mirror, and a 590-nm long pass filter. To measure mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochromec-GFP transfected PC6 cells were loaded with 150 nm TMRM for 15 min in culture medium (24Nieminen A.-L. Petrie T.G. Lemasters J.J. Selman W.R. Neuroscience. 1996; 75: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Subsequently, cells were washed twice with fresh medium and transferred to a mounting chamber on the microscope stage in medium containing 50 nmTMRM. Temperature of the chamber was maintained at 35–37 °C with a heat controller (Bioptechs, Butler, PA). Images of green cytochromec-GFP fluorescence were collected as described above and red TMRM fluorescence was imaged using same filter settings as for MitoTrackerRed CMXRos. For measurements of cytochrome c-GFP and TMRM fluorescence, laser power was attenuated with neutral density filters at least 90% and 99.9%, respectively. In addition, the images were collected at 1 h intervals at the lowest zoom setting. These precautions were taken to avoid photodamage caused by intense laser illumination. After collecting basal images (0 h), 5 μmstaurosporine was added. Subsequently, images were collected at 2, 4, and 5 h. For the assessment of apoptotic cell nuclei, cytochromec-GFP-transfected cells were stained with 500 nmSYTO-13 and imaged using the same filter settings as for cytochromec-GFP. Rat PC6 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids bearing the cytochrome c-GFP fusion construct. To confirm that cytochrome c-GFP was targeted to mitochondria, cells were co-loaded with Mitotracker Red CMXRos, which localizes to mitochondria (23Poot M. Zhang Y.Z. Kramer J.A. Wells K.S. Jones L.J. Hanzel D.K. Lugade A.G. Singer V.L. Haugland R.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c-GFP and Mitotracker Red CMXRos were imaged using laser scanning confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig.1 A, cytochromec-GFP displayed a punctate pattern of fluorescence that was indistinguishable from that of MitoTracker Red. These confocal images demonstrated that the cytochrome c-GFP fusion protein was localized to mitochondria (Fig. 1, A and A′). By contrast, cells transfected with GFP cDNA alone displayed a diffuse fluorescence (Fig. 1 B). The expression of the cytochromec-GFP fusion protein was also confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-GFP antibody (21Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Zang W. Balke C.W. Takeshima H. Wier W.G. Ma J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Mahajan N.P. Linder K. Berry G. Gordon G.W. Heim R. Herman B. Nature Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). To monitor changes in mitochondrial Δψ, cytochromec-GFP-transfected cells were loaded with TMRM. TMRM is a cationic fluorophore that accumulates electrophoretically into mitochondria in response to the negative mitochondrial Δψ (20Ehrenberg B. Montana V. Wei M.D. Wuskell J.P. Loew L.M. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). When mitochondria depolarize, they release TMRM and the red fluorescence inside mitochondria disappears. Accordingly, the green fluorescence of cytochrome c-GFP and the red fluorescence of TMRM were monitored simultaneously in single living cells by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Fig.2 A shows a field of PC6 cells transfected with cytochrome c-GFP (right panel) and loaded with TMRM (left panel). Before addition of staurosporine to induce apoptosis, all cells in the field displayed high mitochondrial Δψ, as indicated by bright punctate fluorescence of TMRM (Fig. 2 A, 0 h, left panel). Not all cells were transfected with cytochrome c-GFP, as indicated by the absence of green fluorescence, but all viable cells had polarized mitochondria as revealed by red fluorescence (Fig.2 A, 0 h, left panel). To induce apoptosis, cells were treated with 5 μmstaurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor, which induces apoptosis in a wide variety of cell types (12Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar, 17Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.-T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.-G. Youle R. J.

Commun. 1998; 242: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the field of PC6 cells shown in Fig. 2 A, TMRM fluorescence began to decrease in cell 1 after 2 h (Fig. 2 A, 2 h, left panel). The decrease of fluorescence was because of the disappearance of a portion of the bright fluorescent mitochondria indicating that some but not all mitochondria had depolarized and released their TMRM. Simultaneously, the pattern of cytochromec-GFP fluorescence began to change from punctate to diffuse, indicating release of cytochrome c-GFP from the mitochondria (Fig. 2 A, 2 h, cell 1, right panel). As cytochrome c-GFP was released, green fluorescence increased diffusely in the cytosol and in the nucleus as well. At this early stage, cytochrome c-GFP fluorescence was not fully diffuse, and a punctate cytochrome c-GFP pattern remained in mitochondria that still retained TMRM fluorescence. After 3 h, however, all mitochondria depolarized, as indicated by the disappearance of virtually all TMRM fluorescence (data not shown). By this time cytochrome c-GFP fluorescence disappeared virtually completely from cell 1, which likely indicated onset of the secondary necrosis that often follows apoptosis. At the onset of cell necrosis, the plasma membrane ruptures and soluble cytosolic proteins, such as cytochrome c-GFP, leak out. However, apoptosis was the primary mode of cell death in the cells studied, as indicated by nuclear shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and formation of apoptotic bodies assessed by the nuclear stain SYTO-13 (Fig. 2 B, Stauro). Similarly, in cell 2 the number of TMRM-labeled mitochondria began to decrease after 2 h of exposure to staurosporine (Fig.2 A, 2 h, cell 2, left panel). At this time, the pattern of cytochrome c-GFP fluorescence was unchanged (Fig. 2 A, 2 h, cell 2, right panel). Subsequently, after 4 h, a greater portion of mitochondria released their TMRM fluorescence (Fig. 2 A, 4 h, cell 2,left panel), and cytochrome c-GFP fluorescence pattern changed from punctate to partially diffuse, indicating a partial redistribution of cytochrome c-GFP from mitochondria to the cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 2 A, 4 h, cell 2,right panel). After 5 h, all mitochondria in cell 2 had released their TMRM, and cytochrome c-GFP fluorescence showed a fully diffuse pattern. All the cytochrome c-GFP transfected cells in the field behaved asynchronously regarding onsets of mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome crelease. To confirm that the changes we observed regarding mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c-GFP fluorescence were indeed related to staurosporine treatment, we observed cells without staurosporine. Mitochondrial Δψ and cytochrome c-GFP distribution did not change in the absence of staurosporine (Fig.2 C). Also the nuclear morphology of the cells remained normal (Fig. 2 B, Cont). These results excluded the possibility that mitochondrial depolarization and cytochromec-GFP redistribution would be related to photodamage induced by laser (27Hüser J. Rechenmacher C.E. Blatter L.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2129-2137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To quantitate the changes in TMRM fluorescence over time, we measured total TMRM fluorescence in each cell. Fig.3 A shows total TMRM fluorescence (x ± S.E.) of all cells studied. After staurosporine, TMRM fluorescence decreased 50% in 5 h. Untreated cells showed no decline in TMRM fluorescence. Fig. 3 B plots individual cellular TMRM fluorescence for each of the cells shown in Fig. 2 A. All cells, except cell 7, showed 10–40% decline in TMRM fluorescence after 2 h of exposure to staurosporine. Subsequently, TMRM fluorescence declined further in each cell in a variable manner. After 7 h, five of nine cells displayed no TMRM fluorescence. Because images of these same cells revealed that individual mitochondria released their TMRM fluorescence heterogeneously in an all-or-none fashion (Fig. 2 A), the decrease of total TMRM fluorescence in individual cells does not mean that all mitochondria within a cell were partially depolarized (Fig.3 B). Rather, a proportion of mitochondria within a cell were fully depolarized. Because the depolarized mitochondria had also lost their punctate cytochrome c-GFP fluorescence, our results indicate strongly that mitochondrial depolarization accompanied and probably preceded cytochrome c-GFP release. Our fusion construct is a 43-kDa protein, whereas endogenous cytochromec is a 15-kDa protein. Thus, endogenous cytochromec might be released before mitochondrial depolarization and before release of the larger molecular weight fusion protein. To exclude this possibility, we monitored the release of endogenous cytochrome c in staurosporine-treated cells by immunocytochemistry (28Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Like cytochrome c-GFP, endogenous cytochrome c displayed punctate fluorescence both in untreated cells and in cells treated with staurosporine for 1 h. After longer exposure to staurosporine, cytochrome cstaining progressively became more diffuse (data not shown). Our results show directly for the first time that mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release occur simultaneously in individual mitochondria of single living cells during staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Although the present work does not attempt to define the mechanism of cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol, the results are compatible with the sequence of events proposed in the MPT hypothesis. Exposure of cells to staurosporine may cause the onset of MPT followed by mitochondrial depolarization. These events may result in matrix swelling because of uptake of water and solutes via the MPT. The expansion of matrix may rupture the mitochondrial outer membrane leading to the release of cytochrome c and other caspase-activating proteins from the intermembrane space (10Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 30Ichas F.

Acta. 1998; 1366: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). When cytochrome c-GFP was released from the mitochondria into the cytosol, green fluorescence increased in the nucleus in all cells studied. In PC6 cells, the cytosol is a small proportion of cell volume that is mostly comprised of nucleoplasm. Once released from mitochondria into the cytosol, cytochrome c-GFP rapidly diffused into the nucleus, presumably through the nuclear pores. Thus, increases of nuclear cytochrome c-GFP reflected increases of cytosolic cytochrome c-GFP. The importance of this nuclear cytochrome c-GFP in the apoptotic process remains to be elucidated.

Transport vesicles emerge from donor compartments and are specifically targeted to acceptor compartments where they deliver cargo through membrane fusion (1Palade G. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). The ability of transport vesicles to specifically recognize appropriate acceptor membrane targets underlies the organization of the secretory pathway (2Rothman J.E.

The SNARE1 hypothesis proposes that membrane target recognition can be attributed to the specific pairing of SNARE proteins (6Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar, 7Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). SNAREs, which are believed to mediate aspects of vesicle docking, priming, and membrane fusion, are common to vesicular trafficking in organisms as diverse as yeast and humans (8Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). SNARE proteins belonging to the VAMP (synaptobrevin), SNAP-25, and syntaxin families form heteromeric complexes that consist of extended, parallel four-helical bundles (9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar, 10Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a set of absolutely conserved polar residues is buried at the center of the helical bundle (9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar, 11Weimbs T. Mostov K.E. Low S.H. Hofmann K.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 260-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). VAMP contributes a single helix to the structure with a central, buried arginine residue. Syntaxin contributes one helix and SNAP-25 provides two helices, each contributing a buried glutamine residue. Syntaxin and VAMP are anchored to opposite membranes through single transmembrane-spanning helices. Thus, formation of a stable SNARE complex brings membranes into direct opposition and may result in membrane fusion or an activated docked state (12Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 13Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). Following membrane fusion, the SNARE complex is dissociated through the action of α-SNAP and the ATPase NSF, allowing the proteins to recycle (15Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar, 16Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The structure of the SNARE complex suggests an attractive model whereby specificity could be generated through specific helical interactions. If SNARE complex formation is responsible for the specificity of membrane fusion in mammalian cells, several criteria must be met. First, there should be a sufficient number of SNARE proteins to account for constitutive membrane trafficking as well as the specialized and regulated secretory processes found in differentiated cell types. Second, the localization of arginine and glutamine classes of SNAREs (r-SNARE and q-SNARE, respectively) should make possible the formation of proper four-helix bundle structures across opposing membranes. Finally, trafficking pathways should be accounted for by the specificity of SNARE pairing. A compilation of SNARE proteins localized within the secretory pathway of a typical eukaryotic cell is depicted in Fig. 1. Both r- and q-SNARE proteins are specifically localized to a variety of membrane compartments throughout the secretory pathway (17Advani R.J. Bae H.R. Bock J.B. Chao D.S. Doung Y.C. Prekeris R.

The number and localization of SNARE proteins indeed suggest that high affinity interactions between sets of SNAREs could account for aspects of the specificity of membrane organization. Therefore, only the final criterion remains: do SNAREs interact specifically? We have investigated the specificity of SNARE interactions by testing the ability of the core, interacting domains from a diverse set of SNARE proteins to form stable SNARE complexes. Every combination that included a syntaxin, VAMP, and SNAP-25 family member formed a highly stable SNARE complex. These results suggest that the core interactions between SNAREs are not the source of specificity in membrane trafficking. Plasmids encoding the syntaxin-1A H3 domain (amino acids 191–266), SNAP-25 N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–82) and C-terminal domain (amino acids 141–206), VAMP2 cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 25–94), VAMP7 cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 1–182), and VAMP8 cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 2–75) were prepared as described previously (10Poirier M.A. Xiao W.

Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding the N-terminal domain of SNAP-23 (amino acids 1–78) was generated by introducing a premature stop codon using PCR-based mutagenesis. All coding regions were sequenced to confirm the absence of PCR-induced errors. With the exception of the N-terminal domain of SNAP-25, which was expressed with a N-terminal 6-histidine tag (His6) using the pQE-30 vector system (Qiagen), all recombinant proteins were expressed as GST fusions from the pGEX-KG vector (24Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). The His6-tagged protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain M15[pREP4] and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli AB1899 cells and purified using glutathione-agarose as described previously (17Advani R.J. Bae H.R. Bock J.B. Chao D.S. Doung Y.C. Prekeris R. Yoo J.S.

Soluble proteins were liberated by thrombin cleavage of the GST fusions immobilized on glutathione-agarose (Sigma). Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bio-Rad dye binding assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The ability of SNARE proteins to form SDS-resistant complexes was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Preincubated mixtures of the SNARE proteins were solubilized in SDS containing sample buffer (final concentrations of 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.9, 2% SDS, 100 mm sucrose, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol), incubated either at room temperature (not boiled) or at 95 °C (boiled) for 5 min before loading onto a 16% polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresed at 25 mA. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. SNARE complexes were formed by mixing approximately equal molar amounts of the relevant proteins and incubating at 4 °C overnight. Complexes were purified by preparative gel filtration (Superdex 75-HiLoad 16/60; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using PBS buffer (10 mmK2PO4, 100 mm KF, pH 7.6, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or, in cases were the complex was not SDS-resistant, by Western blotting against VAMP and concentrated to approximately 10 μm (Ultrafree-4, Millipore). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra and thermal melts were recorded with an Aviv 62DS CD spectrophotometer equipped with a thermoelectric temperature controller. Measurements were made using a 0.1-cm pathlength quartz cuvette. Thermal unfolding experiments were performed by measuring the CD signal at 222 nm (1-min averaging time) in 2 °C steps (2-min equilibration). Data were converted to a fraction of unfolded protein by fitting the lower and upper base lines to 0 and 100% unfolded, respectively. The Tm values were taken as the temperature at which 50% of the signal remained. Tmvalues were largely insensitive to concentration, indicating that the SNARE complexes are not in fast exchange with their constituent monomers. If r- and q-SNARE interactions impart specificity in trafficking, specific combinations of SNAREs should form stable complexes whereas others should not. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the observation that syntaxin-1A, SNAP-25, and VAMP2 form a highly stable ternary complex that is resistant to SDS denaturation (12Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). To simplify the interpretation of our results, we focused on the interacting SNARE domains previously identified by mutagenesis and proteolytic mapping (26Poirier M.A. Hao J.C. Malkus P.N. Chan C.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This complex, which can be dissociated by α-SNAP/NSF, comprises the C-terminal H3 region of syntaxin-1A (amino acids 191–266), the VAMP homologous region (amino acids 25–94), and two separate domains from SNAP-25 (the N-terminal domain, amino acids 1–82, and the C-terminal domain, amino acids 141–206). Using the separate domains of SNAP-25 eliminates higher order multimerization that might complicate binding measurements (26Poirier M.A. Hao J.C. Malkus P.N. Chan C. Moore M.F. King D.S. Bennett M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11370-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Also, the potential complication of the N-terminal domain of syntaxin regulating the kinetic rate of SNARE association is eliminated (28Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R.

Importantly, however, the N-terminal domain of syntaxin and the other protein regions not included in the analysis do not contribute to the associated SNARE complex structurally or thermodynamically (26Poirier M.A. Hao J.C.

For example, thermal unfolding of the complex containing the full-length syntaxin can be deconvoluted into two separate unfolding events, one representing the N-terminal domain of syntaxin and the second representing the melting of the core SNARE complex. Furthermore, the thermal stability of the core complex is virtually identical to the complex formed using the full cytoplasmic regions, indicating that regions outside the interacting domains do not contribute to the SNARE interactions and therefore do not contribute to specificity. SDS-resistant SNARE complexes between syntaxin-1A, SNAP-25 (N- and C-terminal domains), and VAMP2 require all four domains. Any combination of three of the four domains is not sufficient to confer SDS resistance (Fig. 2 A). These results attest to the importance of each of the four SNARE helical regions in forming a highly stable association. Using this SDS resistance assay, we were able to test the ability of various r-SNAREs to substitute for VAMP2 in forming stable complexes. VAMP4, -7, and -8 and rSec22b were chosen as representative r-SNAREs that localize to various cellular compartments (Fig. 1) and that should, according to the SNARE hypothesis, interact with only specific q-SNAREs. Surprisingly, we found that all four VAMPs were able to confer SDS resistance (Fig. 2 B). These results imply that there is little selectivity in the interactions between r- and q-SNAREs. Nevertheless, it is possible that in synaptic exocytosis the q-SNARE complex, syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25, is exceptional in its ability to bind multiple VAMPs. To test this possibility, two additional q-SNARE complexes were chosen for analysis. The combination of syntaxin-4 and SNAP-23 was selected because of their ubiquitous, non-neuronal expression (19Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 29Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), whereas the combination of syntaxin-13 and SNAP-29 was chosen because of their higher sequence divergence relative to syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25, respectively (17Advani R.J. Bae H.R. Bock J.B. Chao D.S. Doung Y.C. Prekeris R. Yoo J.S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10317-10324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 18Steegmaier M.

Like the synaptic exocytosis complex, syntaxin-13 and SNAP-29 were able to form SDS-resistant complexes with every VAMP tested (data not shown). The syntaxin-4·SNAP-23 complex, however, only formed SDS-resistant complexes with VAMP4 and VAMP7. Twelve of the 15 complexes tested were SDS-resistant, demonstrating that an overwhelming number of SNARE combinations form extremely stable structures. Thus, in contrast to the SNARE hypothesis, SNARE interactions are highly promiscuous. To gain a more quantitative understanding of the relative stabilities of SNARE complexes, we used circular dichroism to measure thermal denaturation profiles (Fig. 3,A–C, Table I). Under the conditions used for our measurements, the midpoint of the unfolding transition, Tm, for the neuronal complex consisting of syntaxin-1A, SNAP-25, and VAMP2 was 90 °C. Substituting VAMP2 with VAMP4, -7, or -8 had a relatively minor effect on the denaturation profiles; all melted within a 5 °C range. However, theTm of the complex was reduced by 13 °C when rSec22b was the r-SNARE. It is expected that rSec22b would have the lowest thermal stability given that, relative to the other r-SNAREs examined, the VAMP homologous region of rSec22b is the least conserved. Indeed, modeling the rSec22b sequence in place of VAMP2 in the syntaxin-1A·SNAP-25·VAMP2 crystal structure suggests that rSec22b would be unable to form many of the same salt-bridge interactions (9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar).Table IThermal stabilities of SNARE complexesSyntaxin-1A · SNAP-25Syntaxin-4 · SNAP-23Syntaxin-13 · SNAP-29AverageVAMP290*8070*80VAMP489*87*76*84VAMP7∼92*88*∼85*88VAMP887*8575*82rSec22b77*7666*73Average878374The apparent T m (±2 °C) of each ternary complex represents the midpoint of the unfolding transition.

The averageT m values of each group of ternary complexes are shown at the end of each column or row. SDS-resistant complexes are indicated by asterisks. Complexes formed using the syntaxin-4·SNAP-23 pair and VAMP4, -7, or -8 all had similar Tm values, ranging from 85 to 88 °C. Compared with the syntaxin-1A·SNAP-25-containing complexes (Table I, first column), the Tm values of the syntaxin-4·SNAP-23 complexes containing VAMP8 and rSec22b were only reduced by 2 and 1 °C, respectively. Interestingly, however, unlike the syntaxin-1A·SNAP-25 complexes, the syntaxin-4·SNAP-23 complexes with VAMP8 and rSec22b were not SDS-resistant, suggesting that SDS resistance is not a strict measure of complex stability. Of the SNARE complexes formed with syntaxin-13·SNAP-29 and the various VAMP homologues, the complex containing VAMP7 was the most stable, melting ∼9 °C higher than the next two most stable complexes, those containing VAMP4 and -8. The syntaxin-13·SNAP-29 complex with VAMP2 had a Tm that was 15 °C lower relative to VAMP7, whereas the rSec22b-bound complex had the lowestTm. In general, the syntaxin-1A·SNAP-25 q-SNARE combination resulted in the highest average SNARE complex thermal stabilities, followed by syntaxin-4·SNAP-23 and syntaxin-13·SNAP-29. For the r-SNARE family, VAMP7 generated the highest average thermal stabilities, whereas rSec22b generated the lowest. These results demonstrate that although there is variability in the thermal stabilities, all the VAMPs tested can bind a variety of q-SNARE combinations to generate very stable structures. Finally, we examined the effect of varying the q-SNARE on complex stability. With the r-SNARE VAMP2 constant, we tested the nine q-SNARE combinations for SDS resistance. All the combinations that included SNAP-25 or SNAP-29 formed SDS-resistant complexes (TableII); only the SNAP-23-containing complexes were not SDS-resistant. It is interesting that SNAP-23 and SNAP-25 display different SDS resistance properties, as they are highly conserved in their interacting domains (67% identical), whereas SNAP-23 and SNAP-29 are only 32% identical and SNAP-25 and SNAP-29 are only 33% identical. In terms of thermal stability of all the q-SNARE combinations only the syntaxin-13·SNAP-23 pair was particularly unfavorable (Fig. 4, A–C, Table II). Indeed, complexes containing syntaxin-13 in combination with SNAP-23, -25, or -29 were in general the least stable, with an average melting temperature of 66 °C compared with 83 and 84 °C for complexes containing syntaxin-1A and -4, respectively (Table II). It is not obvious from the sequences or the crystal structure why the syntaxin-13·SNAP-23·VAMP2 complex is less stable (9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). For example, many of the salt-bridge interactions are conserved. There are, however, a few changes in the core residues, such as an alanine (SNAP-23) to valine (SNAP-25) substitution, that could result in destabilizing side chain packing defects.Table IIThermal stabilities of different q-SNARE combinations with VAMP2VAMP2Syntaxin-1ASyntaxin-4Syntaxin-13AverageSNAP-2379805371SNAP-2590*86*74*83SNAP-2983*84*70*79Average838466See the legend to Table I. Open table in a new tab See the legend to Table I. Importantly, from these data we can conclude that the stability patterns are not consistent with protein localization and known trafficking pathways. For example, rSec22b is the r-SNARE responsible for endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi trafficking, yet it forms stable complexes with combinations of syntaxins-1, -4, and -13 and SNAP-23, -25 and -29, q-SNAREs that function in post-Golgi trafficking. Furthermore, syntaxin-13 functions in recycling of plasma membrane proteins and is localized to the tubular vesicular endosomes, and syntaxin-4 is localized to the plasma membrane where it functions in exocytosis (30Volchuk A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 957-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These q-SNAREs do not readily differentiate between the various VAMPs tested. Why are all the SNARE complexes so stable? The activation energies for steps in vesicle fusion are reported to be large (32Lee J. Lentz B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9274-9279Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). If SNARE complexes function to catalyze a step in membrane fusion, the energy from complex formation could help to overcome the activation barrier encountered in bringing membranes into close proximity or perhaps catalyzing some aspect of phospholipid rearrangement (33Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 34Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1087-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The yeast exocytosis complex, Sso1-Sec9-Snc2p, under similar conditions to ours thermally unfolds at 72 °C (28Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 35Rice L.M. Brennwald P. Brünger A.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This temperature is similar to the lower range we observed for the mammalian SNARE combinations, suggesting that most of the complexes in this study would be energetically suitable for function. The necessity for high stability in SNARE complexes perhaps is achieved at the expense of specificity. The fact remains, however, that only certain SNARE complexes are formedin vivo. If specific SNARE associations are not thermodynamically controlled, then how are the SNARE interactions regulated? It is clear that most SNARE proteins are localized to distinct compartments in the cell, so presumably their interactionsin vivo are spatially restricted. Indeed, in yeast, a mislocalized q-SNARE, Vam3p, can functionally substitute for Pep12p (36Darsow T. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Other sources of trafficking specificity may come from regulatory factors such as the Ypt/Rab and Sec1 families (37Sogaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Sollner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 38Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Rab effector proteins may function as membrane-specific docking factors, thus directing the formation of certain SNARE combinations. Also, targeting complexes, such as has been suggested for the sec6·sec8 complex, could play an important role in defining transport destinations (39Grindstaff K.K. Yeaman C. Anandasabapathy N. Hsu S.C. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Scheller R.H. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 731-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In addition, the transport of vesicles from donor to acceptor site is highly specific and likely regulated by distinct sets of motors and cytoskeletal elements. Thus, perhaps membrane fusion specificity is not due to a single mechanism but rather involves several different layers of regulation. If SNARE interactions are not specific, why are there so many SNAREs? Distinct SNAREs are likely necessary to maintain and regulate the complex intracellular compartmental organization. Membrane trafficking is extremely dynamic and, thus, all membranes need to maintain appropriate concentrations and arrays of SNARE proteins for membrane fusion events to occur. This is accomplished through numerous antro- and retrograde trafficking pathways, which may require specific sequence information outside the core interacting regions. Such a mechanism allows the possibility of integrating multiple trafficking pathways through promiscuous SNARE pairings, as has been suggested by the finding that a single r-SNARE functions with different q-SNAREs in directing anterograde and retrograde membrane transport (23Mollard G.F. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although the idea that selective pairing of SNAREs mediates vesicle targeting and fusion specificity served as a motivation for characterizing and localizing these proteins, our results suggest that the organization of the secretory pathway relies on other mechanisms to generate specificity.

Opening in response to changes in intracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]i), Ca2+-activated K+(KCa)1 channels play an important role in modulating the Ca2+ signaling cascade by regulating the membrane potential in both excitable and nonexcitable cells. Historically, these channels have been classified as large (BKCa), intermediate (IKCa), and small (SKCa) conductance channels based on their single-channel conductance in symmetrical K+ solutions (1Latorre R. Oberhauser A. Labarca P. Alvarez O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). BKCa channels have a single channel conductance of 100–250 pS, are opened by elevated [Ca2+]i as well as by depolarization, and are blocked by the scorpion peptides charybdotoxin (ChTX) and iberiotoxin (2Kaczorowski G.J.

SKCa channels have unitary conductances of 4–14 pS; are highly sensitive to [Ca2+]i, with activation in the 200–500 nm range; and are voltage-independent (9Hille B.

SKCa channels are highly expressed in the central nervous system, where they modulate the firing pattern of neurons via the generation of slow membrane after-hyperpolarizations (10Sah P.

Thus, hIKCa1 constitutes a distinct subfamily within the extended K+ channel supergene family. The Ca2+ sensor for BKCa channels resides in a negatively charged Ca2+ bowl domain in the C-tail of the α-subunit (28Wei A. Solaro C. Lingle C. Salkoff L.

In marked contrast, the protein-coding regions ofSKCa1–3 and hIKCa1 do not contain any EF-hand or Ca2+ bowl motifs in their primary amino acid sequence, despite their exquisite Ca2+ sensitivity. This observation led us to speculate that the Ca2+ sensor for these channels either resides in a novel motif intrinsic to the channel or is provided by an accessory subunit that is tightly linked to channel activity. We investigated the latter possibility in a yeast two-hybrid system usinghIKCa1 as our prototype. The Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CAM) was identified as a strong interacting partner of the C-tail of hIKCa1. Recently, CAM was shown to confer Ca2+ sensitivity to SKCa channel subfamily members (30Xia X.-M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Here, we report that CAM binds to and is required for Ca2+-dependent activation of hIKCa1. Biochemical studies demonstrate that both hIKCa1 andhSKCa3 are prebound tightly to CAM in a Ca2+-independent fashion. Finally, we show by expression and patch-clamp recording that four CAMs are required to mediate the Ca2+-dependent channel activity of thehIKCa1 tetramer. We have previously reported the cloning of hIKCa1 (22Logsdon N.J. Kang J. Togo J.A. Christian E.P. Aiyar J. J. Biol.

Drosophila wild-type (WT) and mutant (B1234Q) CAMs with differing Ca2+ sensitivities have been reported previously (32Maune J.F. Klee C.B. Beckingham K. J. Biol.

The B1234Q mutant has all four EF-hands mutated; glutamates 31, 67, 104, and 140 are replaced by glutamine (33Mukherjea P. Maune J.F. Beckingham K. Protein Science. 1996; 5: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PAGA2 vector was a kind gift of Lutz Birnbaumer (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). This vector is a pGEM3-based version of the pAGA vector, both of which contain the 5′-untranslated region of alfalfa virus RNA 4 and a 92-base pair poly(A) tail to increase stability of message and for efficient in vitro translation. The segments of DNA encoding the C-terminal tails of hIKCa1(nucleotides 1252–1678; GenBankTM accession AF022797),hSKCa3 (nucleotides 1632–2193; GenBankTMaccession number AF031815) and mKv1.3 (nucleotides 1736–2112; GenBankTM accession number M30441) were subcloned into the PAGA2 vector using the polymerase chain reaction with engineered restriction sites. Both CAM clones were also subcloned into the PAGA2 vector. For co-precipitation and electrophysiology experiments (see below), the full-length hIKCa1(GenBankTM accession number AF033021) and mKv1.3coding regions were fused in-frame with a N-terminal His6 tag in the pcDNA3.1-His-C vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). All clones were verified by sequencing. A 426-base pair fragment ofhIKCa1 coding for residues 286–427 in the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of the channel was subcloned into the GAL4 DNA-binding vector (pAS2–1, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using polymerase chain reaction and engineered restriction sites. This construct was used as bait to screen an activated human leukocyte cDNA library (HL4021AB, CLONTECH). Screening procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (CLONTECH PT3061-1). Several thousand putative positives were identified after first-round selection in growth medium; they were then subjected to the colony-liftlacZ assay. Positive blue colonies were sequenced using vector-specific primers. Two methods were used to test for CAM binding to the channel proteins. The initial deletion constructs ofhIKCa1 were generated by polymerase chain reaction as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions in the pGEX-6P-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21-De3, and synthesis of the fusion proteins was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside in a liquid culture grown toA 600 of ∼1.0. After 2.5 h at 37 °C, cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in NETN lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl; 1.0 ml per 20 ml of culture) containing protease inhibitor mixture (complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets, Boehringer Mannheim), and lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins in the supernatant were adsorbed for 30 min at room temperature to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in NETN (1 volume of lysate:0.4 volume of 50% (v/v) slurry of Sepharose-GSH beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in NETN), which were then washed with binding buffer containing 1% (v/v) polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For experiments investigating Ca2+ dependence, the above buffer contained, in addition, 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EDTA. Slurries (50% (v/v)) of the bound Sepharose-GSH beads (Sepharose-GSH:GST fusions) were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 50 μl of binding buffer containing [35S]methionine-labeled hCAM, synthesized by coupled transcription-translation (TnT, Promega, Madison, WI) as described (34Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The bound beads were washed three times with binding buffer and resuspended in 15 μl (three volumes) of 2× Laemmli's sample buffer. Proteins released from the beads by boiling in the presence of reducing reagent were analyzed by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography to detect retention of hCAM by the channel-GST fusion proteins. To ensure equivalent protein loading, gels were stained with colloidal blue (Novex, San Diego, CA) to visualize the major protein band in each lane prior to autoradiography. Binding of WT- and B1234Q-CAMs to the C-tail of hIKCa1 was also determined using the GST pull-down method as above. For all other experiments, channel constructs in the pAGA2 vector were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine during coupled transcription-translation using reagents from Promega. These constructs were incubated with CAM-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, slurries of CAM beads (50% (v/v)) in binding buffer (as described above) were incubated with radiolabeled channel proteins that had been normalized for radioactive incorporation using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Equal cpms of each specific protein were added to 50 μl of binding buffer including either 2 mm EDTA or 1 mm Ca2+. Binding and washing conditions were the same as for the GST-Sepharose experiments above. Proteins released from the beads by boiling in the presence of reducing reagent were analyzed by 18% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. mKv1.3 andhIKCa1 expression constructs in pcDNA-3.1His(C) were transfected into COS-7 cells using Fugene6 (Boehringer Manheim) according to the supplied protocol. About 40 h after transfection, 5 × 106 cells were lysed in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 40 mm KCl, 0.75 mm EDTA (free Ca2+ concentration, <1 nm), 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors. After 20 min on ice, cells were Dounce-homogenized and centrifuged at 2900 × g for 15 min to remove insoluble material. The soluble lysate was transferred to a clean tube and mixed with an equal volume of 2× binding buffer (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 200 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 60 mm imidazole, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors). The diluted lysate containing the membrane fraction was incubated with Ni+-NTA resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for ∼2 h at 4 °C in order to immobilize the His-tagged channel protein. After extensively washing the resin with wash buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.25% Triton X-100, 30 mm imidazole, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors), the channel protein was eluted with elution buffer (same as wash buffer but containing 400 mmimidazole). Proteins from the elution fraction, as well as from the flow-through, were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. To determine whether CAM was preassociated with hIKCa1 or mKv1.3, a Western blot analysis was performed using an anti-CAM monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells were maintained in a culture medium of Eagle's minimum essential medium (BIO-Whittaker, San Diego, CA) supplemented with 1 mml-glutamine (Sigma) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Summit Biotechnology, Fort Collins, CO) and grown in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were plated to grow nonconfluently on glass 1 day prior to use for cRNA injection and electrophysiological experiments. T-lymphocytes were isolated from human peripheral blood and activated with phytohemagglutinin (DIFCO, Detroit, MI) as described previously (20Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 601-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Prior to experimentation, cells were plated for 15 min on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). For other experiments, we stably transfected the COS-7 cell line withhIKCa1; the biophysical properties of the hIKCa1channels in these cells are indistinguishable from those of IKCa channels in T-cells (data not shown). Plasmids containing the entire coding sequence of the hIKCa1 gene, WT-CAM, and B1234Q-CAM were linearized with NotI andin vitro transcribed with the T7 mMessage mMachine system (Ambion, Austin TX). Plasmids containing the mKv1.3 coding sequence were linearized with EcoRI and in vitrotranscribed with the Sp6 version of the same kit. The resulting cRNA was phenol/chloroform-purified and stored at −75 °C. RNA concentrations were determined to an accuracy of 25%, based on intensity of bands in agarose gel electrophoresis. The cRNA was diluted with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (Sigma) (averageM r, 10,000; 0.1% in 100 mm KCl). RBL cells were injected with an Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany) microinjection system (Micro-manipulator 5171 and Transjector 5246) using injection capillaries (Femtotips®, Eppendorf) filled with the cRNA/fluorescein isothiocyanate solution, as described previously (35Ikeda S.R. Soler F. Zuhlke R.D. Lewis D.L. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 422: 201-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were visualized by fluorescence, and hIKCa1-specific currents were measured 4–8 h after injection. Cells measured in the whole cell configuration were normally bathed in normal Ringer solution containing 160 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose; adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH, with an osmolarity of 290–320 mosm. In K+ Ringer solution, Na+ was replaced by K+. A simple syringe-driven perfusion system was used to exchange the bath solutions in the recording chamber. The internal pipette solution with 1 μm free Ca2+contained 145 mm K+ aspartate, 8.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm K2 EGTA; adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH, with an osmolarity of 290–310 mosm. EGTA was omitted in the high Ca2+ internal solution containing 1 mm CaCl2. Pipettes were pulled from glass capillaries, coated with Sylgard (Dow-Corning, Midland, MI), and fire-polished to resistances measured in the bath of 2–5 MΩ. Membrane currents were recorded with an EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) interfaced to a computer running acquisition and analysis software (Pulse and PulseFit; HEKA elektronik). Data were filtered at 1.5 kHz, and all voltages were corrected for a liquid junction potential offset of −13 mV for aspartate-based solutions. The holding potential in all experiments was −80 mV. For characterization of the hIKCa1 current, voltage ramp stimuli were used to assess channel activation by elevated [Ca2+]i. RBL cells express an endogenous inwardly rectifying K+ channel that did not interfere with KCa currents seen at depolarized potentials. Experiments were performed at room temperature (21–25 °C). The CAM antagonists W7, trifluoperazine (TFP), and calmidazolium were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). ChTX was obtained either from Peptides International, (Louisville, KY) or from BACHEM Biosciences (King of Prussia, PA). Clotrimazole was purchased from Sigma. All slope conductances reported in the text are written as mean ± S.E. (number of cells or experiments). We searched for accessory molecules that bind tohIKCa1 using the yeast two-hybrid system. We reasoned that if such a molecule is involved in Ca2+ sensing, it must be common to IKCa and SKCa channels, because their Ca2+ sensitivities and gating behavior are remarkably similar (10Sah P.

An amino acid alignment ofhIKCa1 with hSKCa1, rSKCa2, and hSKCa3revealed that except for the pore and the transmembrane regions, the proximal half of the cytoplasmic C-tail was the most highly conserved (Fig. 1); the C-tail of hIKCa1was therefore employed as the bait. We chose an activated human leukocyte cDNA library to screen for interaction partners becausehIKCa1 has been previously shown to be highly up-regulated in activated lymphocytes (20Grissmer S.

A primary screen using the triple nutrient selection (Trp+Leu+His+) resulted in the identification of several thousand positive clones. A subsequent subscreen of 500 colonies yielded nine clones that were positive for β-galactosidase activity. Seven of these clones encodedCAM. We next examined the ability of 35S-labeled in vitro translated hIKCa1-C-tail to bind CAM-Sepharose as assessed by running the product on an SDS-PAGE gel followed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig.2 A, a radiolabeled band of ∼28 kDa is visible (hIKCa1) consistent with the size of the hIKCa1 C-tail (Fig. 2 B), indicating thathIKCa1 and CAM interact. CAM also binds to the C-tail of the SKCa channel, hSKCa3 (Fig. 2 A, ∼22-kDa band (hSKCa3)), but not the C-tail of the voltage-gated K+ channel, mKv1.3 (Fig2 A, mKv1.3). As an additional specificity control, we performed GST pull-down experiments; CAM did not bind GST alone but interacted with the GST-hIKCa1 C-tail (Fig.3 A). Thus, CAM interacts specifically with members of the IKCa and SKCafamily.Figure 3Deletion analysis of hIKCa1C-tail. A, glutathione-Sepharose beads containing GST fusion constructs of either the entire C-tail or deletion fragments of hIKCa1 C-tail were incubated with 35S-labeled CAM in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ (top panel) or in the presence of 2 mm EDTA and no added Ca2+ (bottom panel). Coomassie gels ensured equivalent loading of protein in all lanes (data not shown).B, deletion constructs 1–82, 1–72, and 1–62 were35S-labeled by transcription-translation and incubated with CAM-Sepharose beads in the presence of 1 mmCa2+ (left panel) or in buffers containing 2 mm EDTA and no added Ca2+ (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Surprisingly, the C-tail fragments of hIKCa1 andhSKCa3 bound CAM efficiently in buffers containing 2 mm EDTA and no added Ca2+ (Fig. 2 A, hIKCa1 and mKv1.3, right panel). Deletion analysis revealed that the shorter 1–98 and 1–62 fragments of thehIKCa1 C-tail also bound CAM efficiently in Ca2+-free conditions (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel;Fig. 3 B, right panel). Four additional deletion fragments (45–98, 37–77, 1–72, and 1–82) bound CAM, but only in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 3 A, top panel;Fig. 3 B, left panel), whereas two others (1–50 and 93–142) did not bind CAM at all (Fig. 3). Thus, CAM interacts with the C-tails of hIKCa1 and hSKCa3 in the absence of Ca2+, and this property resides in a domain within the first 62 residues of the hIKCa1 C-tail. The segment between residues 62 and 82 appears to mask the Ca2+-independent interaction of CAM with hIKCa1, because the 1–72 and 1–82 fragments bind CAM only in the presence of Ca2+, whereas residues 82–98 appear to reverse the negative effect of 62–82. Removal of as yet unidentified motifs between residues 1 and 37 appears to unmask a Ca2+-dependent interaction with CAM. Interestingly, the 1–98 segment of the hIKCa1-C-tail, which contains the Ca2+-independent and Ca2+-dependent modulatory domains, shares"

Proteasomal degradation required physical interaction with the molecular chaperone calnexin. Altered sedimentation of intracellular complexes following treatment with the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, and in combination with mannosidase inhibition, revealed that the removal of mannose from attached oligosaccharides abrogates the release of misfolded α1-antitrypsin from calnexin prior to proteasomal degradation. Intracellular turnover was arrested with kifunensine, implicating the participation of endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase I in the disposal process.

As observed for other hepatic secretory glycoproteins (29Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), rounds of binding to calnexin are predicted to facilitate the folding of the newly synthesized AAT into its functional conformation (25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our analyses have shown that prolonged physical association with calnexin accompanies intracellular retention of the terminally misfolded glycoprotein (25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and that the removal of mannose from asparagine-linked oligosaccharides is essential for subsequent degradation (25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The focus of the present study was to investigate the intracellular degradation of misfolded AAT as a model to elucidate the role of intracellular mannosidase activity in glycoprotein quality control, a phenomenon recently observed by us (25Liu Y.

Results from the present investigation are consistent with a model in which modification by ER mannosidase I mediates the proteasomal degradation of terminally misfolded AAT by abrogating its dissociation from calnexin in response to the attenuated deglucosylation of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. This finding provides evidence that ER-situated mannosidase activity occupies a previously unrecognized elevated hierarchical position among known members of the glycoprotein folding and quality control machinery and extends the role of calnexin beyond that of a simple molecular chaperone. All salts, buffers, and protease inhibitors were purchased from Sigma, except for lactacystin, which was synthesized by Dr. E. J. Corey (Harvard University). Endoglycosidase H, jack bean mannosidase, and all oligosaccharide processing inhibitors were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, with the exception of castanospermine (CalBiochem) and kifunensine (Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc). All tissue culture media were purchased from ICN Biochemicals and Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was procured from Summit Biotechnology. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against a synthetic peptide homologous to the cytoplasmic tail of canine calnexin was purchased from StressGen, and an IgG fraction of polyclonal goat anti-human AAT was procured from Organon Teknika-Cappel. Mouse hepatoma cells were stably transfected with DNA encoding human AAT in which 33 amino acids are absent from the carboxyl terminus of the 394-amino acid polypeptide (cell line H1A/N13) (21Sifers R.N. Brashears-Macatee S. Kidd V.J. Muensch H. Woo S.L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7330-7335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, incubation of cells with inhibitors was performed for 60 min in regular growth medium (25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) prior to a 15-min pulse in methionine-free medium containing [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) (23Le A. Ferrell G.A. Dishon D.S. Le Q.-Q. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysis was performed with buffered Nonidet P-40 (25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and protein immunoprecipitation was accomplished by a 2-h incubation of the soluble cell lysate with an excess of specific antiserum immobilized to protein G-agarose, as described (25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Following immunoprecipitation, radiolabeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by fluorographic enhancement of vacuum-dried gels. Increased electrophoretic mobility of radiolabeled AAT, resulting from oligosaccharide modification, was resolved in 20-cm gels (25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Calnexin-associated AAT was separated from released monomers by velocity sedimentation of Nonidet P-40 cell lysates in linear 5–20% sucrose gradients as described previously (24Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Physical interaction with calnexin was confirmed by sequential coimmunoprecipitation of radiolabeled molecules with antiserum against the molecular chaperone as described previously (25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The relative amount of AAT in each sedimenting species was assessed by scintillation spectrophotometry of immunoprecipitated protein excised from the gel. Prior to treatment, calnexin was dissociated from immunoprecipitated AAT by incubation with 5 mm EDTA at 37 °C (24Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestions were performed for 16 h at 37 °C with 0.03 μg of jack bean mannosidase in 50 μl of 10 mmcitrate, pH 5.0, followed by an additional 8-h incubation upon the addition of another aliquot of enzyme. Resolution of AAT glycoforms was accomplished by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Electrophoretic AAT standards in which all three attached oligosaccharides contain glucose was generated by preincubating cells with 0.2 μg/ml castanospermine prior to pulse-radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation. The standard in which one of the attached oligosaccharides contain glucose was generated by chasing pulse-radiolabeled cells in medium containing metabolic poisons to disrupt the physical interaction with calnexin (26Choudhury P. Liu Y. Bick R. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13446-13451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), resulting in the hydrolysis of glucose residues prior to immunoprecipitation. In the absence of COOH-terminal amino acids, human AAT is unable to progress to the correctly folded conformation (34Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In pulse-chase studies using [35S]methionine, the terminally misfolded molecules were completely eliminated from stably transfected mouse hepatoma cells within 4 h of chase (t 12 = 2 h) (Fig.1 a). Although unaffected by the lysosomotrophic amine chloroquine, intracellular disposal was inhibited >85% upon incubation of cells with the membrane-permeable peptide aldehydes N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal andN-acetyl-leu-leu-methioninal (Fig. 1 a), both of which are nonspecific inhibitors of proteasomal degradation (35Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Nearly complete inhibition occurred upon incubation with lactacystin, a specific irreversible covalent inhibitor of the proteasome (36Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar), confirming the participation of the multicatalytic proteolytic complex in the disposal process. Incubation of cells with the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine prior to pulse-radiolabeling with [35S]methionine was performed to maintain asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in the original Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 structure, preventing posttranslational assembly between the newly synthesized glycoprotein and calnexin (25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, intracellular turnover was unaffected by each of the three proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 1 a). Because no insoluble radioactive AAT was detected under the latter conditions (not shown), these findings indicate that misfolded molecules are substrates for degradation by an alternative proteolytic system under conditions that prevent physical interaction with calnexin. Simultaneous detection of calnexin-associated (6.8 S) and released AAT monomers (4.5 S) by velocity sedimentation (25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) has provided evidence for the partitioning of the unfolded glycoprotein between the chaperone-associated and unbound state. A sedimentation coefficient of 6.8 S was exhibited by the entire population of misfolded AAT molecules following a 4-h chase with lactacystin (Fig.2 a, LCT), and the observation was duplicated in two additional experiments. This anomaly coincided with the quantitative coimmunoprecipitation of radiolabeled AAT with antiserum against calnexin (Fig. 2 b). An identical manipulation did not hinder the secretion of wild-type AAT (not shown), indicating that the ability of lactacystin treatment to prevent the release of the glycoprotein from calnexin was restricted to the terminally misfolded molecule. Because the detection of 4.5 S AAT monomers requires posttranslational release from calnexin (25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), it became apparent that the abrogated dissociation of the 6.8 S complex precedes proteasomal degradation, possibly as a normal step in the disposal process. Enhanced electrophoretic mobility of radiolabeled molecules in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 b, CO), which results from the removal of mannose from attached oligosaccharides (24Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), was arrested, as was intracellular disposal, by incubating cells with 1-deoxymannojirimycin (Fig. 1 b, DMJ), an inhibitor of ER mannosidases (37Elbein A.D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, of the two events, only intracellular disposal was arrested with lactacystin (Fig. 1 b, LCT), confirming that the removal of mannose from asparagine-linked oligosaccharides precedes proteolysis. The importance of this finding was revealed in the next set of experiments, in which a population of released misfolded monomers, in addition to the 6.8 S complex, was detected following coincubation of cells with both lactacystin and the mannosidase inhibitor (Fig. 2 a, LCT+DMJ). Under these conditions, the relative ratio of the 6.8 and 4.5 S species was identical to that observed when disposal had been arrested with 1-deoxymannojirimycin alone (Fig. 2 a, DMJ). These findings demonstrate that intracellular mannosidase activity is responsible for abrogating the dissociation of misfolded AAT from calnexin prior to proteolysis. In the absence of sufficient material to characterize the mannose content of attached oligosaccharides, we examined the effect of processing inhibitors on AAT disposal as a means to identify the mannosidase activity essential for degradation. Because the oligosaccharide-dependent size shift has been localized to the ER (24Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the involvement of two processing α-mannosidases, each of which can initiate the removal of mannose from asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in higher eukaryotes (38Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and is inhibited with 1-deoxymannojirimycin (39Weng S. Spiro R.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Of the two enzymes, ER mannosidase I catalyzes the removal of the outermost mannose unit from the middle branch of Man9GlcNAc2 (Fig.3 a), and is inhibited by the plant alkaloid kifunensine (39Weng S. Spiro R.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A separate mannose unit is excised by the kifunensine-resistant ER mannosidase II (40Weng S. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25656-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is sensitive to both swainsonine and 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-mannitol (38Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with kifunensine arrested the intracellular disposal of misfolded AAT (Fig. 3 b, KIF), whereas no demonstrable effect was exerted by either of the ER mannosidase II inhibitors (Fig. 3 b, SWN, DIM), indicating that trimming of attached glycans to Man8GlcNAc2, by ER mannosidase I, is responsible for mediating the onset of misfolded AAT degradation by the proteasome in these cells. Reversible glucosylation of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides mediates the partitioning of glycoproteins between the calnexin-associated and unbound state (41Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar,42Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Results from separate in vitro studies have demonstrated that whereas glucose transfer by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGTR) to asparagine-linked Man8GlcNAc2 remains 70% as efficient as for the Man9GlcNAc2 precursor (43Parodi A.J. Mendelzon D.H. Lederkremer G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8260-8265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), subsequent deglucosylation of Glc1Man8GlcNAc2by glucosidase II is diminished to only 21% of that observed for Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 substrate (44Grinna L.S. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2255-2258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the deglucosylation of Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 is very inefficient, at least for the protein-free oligosaccharide (44Grinna L.S. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2255-2258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the next set of experiments we tested the hypothesis that the removal of a single mannose unit from multiple oligosaccharides attached to the unbound monomer prevents complete dissociation of the complex following assembly with calnexin, as depicted in Fig.4. The accuracy of this prediction was first addressed by asking whether any of the oligosaccharides of calnexin-associated AAT contained glucose following inhibition of proteolysis with lactacystin. Because the removal of mannose by jack bean mannosidase is restricted by terminal glucose units (Fig.5 a), differential migration of mannosidase-digested glycoproteins in SDS-PAGE was used as a method to identify the number of oligosaccharides attached to [35S]methionine-radiolabeled AAT that are glucosylated (45Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For AAT, a total of four glycoforms can be generated by this methodology in which either 0, 1, 2, or all 3 attached oligosaccharides contain glucose. However, two predominant bands were resolved by SDS-PAGE following lactacystin treatment (Fig. 5 b, LCT). When compared with the migration of known electrophoretic mobility standards (Fig. 5 b, Stds), it was concluded that these species represented populations of calnexin-associated AAT in which either two or all three asparagine-linked oligosaccharides contain glucose (Fig. 5 b, LCT). A slight variation in this pattern has been observed in four additional experiments, including the infrequent detection of a faster migrating band in which only a single glycan contains glucose (not shown). Importantly, the latter species has routinely represented <10% of the total glycoform population, suggesting that it represents a minor species. Finally, radiolabel from [14C]galactose (46Godelaine D. Spiro M.J. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10161-10168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was incorporated as glucose into asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of the misfolded glycoprotein during cycloheximide treatment (not shown), indicating that the sugar units had been added posttranslationally, as would be expected for substrates of UGTR.Figure 5Detection and quantitation of glucosylated asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. a, strategy for detecting glycoprotein bearing glucosylated oligosaccharides. A terminal glucose unit (open square) hinders the removal of mannose residues (closed circles) by jack bean mannosidase (JBM). b, electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE of radiolabeled misfolded AAT. The differential electrophoretic mobility of standards (Stds) is shown in which all three or none of the attached oligosaccharides contain glucose (see under “Materials and Methods”). Following a 4-h chase with lactacystin (LCT), radiolabeled misfolded AAT was immunoprecipitated from cells and then was either mock-digested (lane 1), digested with jack bean mannosidase (lane 2), or digested with endoglycosidase for total deglycosylation (lane 3) prior to fractionation by SDS-PAGE and detection by fluorography. For this experiment, all samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on the same gel, and the predicted number of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides that contain glucose is shown to the right of each panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we attempted to establish a causal relationship between the attenuation of oligosaccharide deglucosylation and proteasomal degradation of misfolded AAT. Because a dynamic interaction with calnexin allows for the liberation of bound glycoprotein substrates in response to the deglucosylation of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides (41Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we took advantage of the 2-h half-life of the misfolded protein to test the effect of a posttranslational glucosidase blockade as a means to bypass the predicted role of mannose removal to attenuate oligosaccharide deglucosylation. For this, pulse-radiolabeled cells were chased with medium containing the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine to directly inhibit the activity of glucosidase II following cotranslational assembly of molecules with calnexin. Disposal of misfolded AAT was accelerated >2-fold under these conditions (Fig.6 a, lane 4) as compared with control cells (lane 2). Accelerated intracellular turnover was also observed when pulse-radiolabeled cells were chased with deoxynojirimycin (Fig. 6 b, DNJ), an alternative glucosidase inhibitor and glucose analog (37Elbein A.D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In contrast, incubation with the galactose analog, deoxygalactojirimycin, had no influence on the rate of degradation (Fig. 6 b, DgalJ). A ∼1.5-h lag preceded the acceleration of degradation (not shown), possibly reflecting the time required for either inhibitor to attain an appropriate concentration in the ER. It is unlikely that accelerated degradation resulted from the displacement of misfolded AAT by castanospermine because the compound is a transition state analog of the glucosidase reaction, rather than a true structural analog of glucose (37Elbein A.D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Coincubation of cells with 1-deoxymannojirimycin during the posttranslational glucosidase blockade had no inhibitory effect on the accelerated rate of disposal (Fig.6 a, lane 5), as compared with when the mannosi"

PKR overexpression in HeLa cells induces apoptosis (28Lee S.B. Esteban M. Virology. 1994; 199: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) by mechanisms that are inhibitable by Bcl-2 (27Lee S.B. Rodriguez D. Rodriguez J.R. Esteban M. Virology. 1997; 231: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Antisense ablation of PKR conferred resistance to tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-induced apoptosis in U937 cells (36Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) indicating the requirement for PKR in the apoptotic response to TNF-α in these cells. It is thought that dsRNA is a trigger for apoptosis in vaccinia virus-infected cells (37Kibler K.V. Shors T. Perkins K.B. Zeman C.C. Banaszak M.P. Biesterfeldt J. Langland J.O. Jacobs B.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1992-2003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and influenza-mediated apoptosis is suppressed in cells expressing inactivated PKR (26Takizawa T. Ohashi K. Nakanishi Y. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8128-8132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Much of the work elucidating the role of PKR in growth control and apoptosis utilized mutated PKR in tissue culture settings. Previous work on targeted disruption of Pkr by homologous recombination in mice focused on interruption of two exons including one that encodes the initiating methionine (25Yang Y. Reis L.F.L. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R.G. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, analysis of this PKR-defective mouse model revealed no evidence of tumors and normal anti-viral responses in untreated animals. The mice were defective in IRF-1 and NF-κB signaling and showed diminished stress-induced apoptotic responses (20Kumar A. Yang Y.L. Flati V. Der S. Kadereit S. Deb A. Haque J. Reis L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 25Yang Y. Reis L.F.L. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R.G. Aguet M. Weissmann C.

A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). To examine whether PKR is essential in anti-viral response, anti-proliferative functions of cellular growth control, and in apoptotic response to various stimuli, we generated mice devoid of PKR function by targeted disruption of the PKR catalytic domain using homologous recombination that interrupts exon 12. Mice homozygous for Pkr disruption (Pkr 0/0) develop normally and are fertile with average sized litters. IFN-α and -β induction of transcription is intact, and the mice show normal hematopoiesis. Pkr 0/0 mice show responses to vaccinia and influenza infection comparable to control animals or cells. Apoptotic response to influenza infection or TNF-α was not impaired. Our data indicate that catalytic disruption of Pkr is not sufficient to ablate eIF-2α phosphorylation and that unappreciated members of the eIF-2α kinase family must compensate for loss of PKR function. A 28.8-kb region of isogenic DNA encoding murine PKR was isolated and mapped. A 2.9-kb SacI fragment that encodes exons 10 and 11 (39Kuhen K.L. Shen X. Carlisle E.R. Richardson A.L. Weier H.U. Tanaka H. Samuel C.E. Genomics. 1996; 36: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) as determined by sequence analysis and a 1.9-kbXhoI/BamHI fragment that bears intron XII sequence just distal to exon 12 were cloned into the MC1 neo poly(A) vector (Stratagene). The herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase expression cassette was introduced into the 3′ end of the vector at theNotI site to produce the PKR catalytic domain replacement vector designated pTV65TK. Insertion of the neomycin (neo) cassette results in replacement of a 3.7-kb BamHI to XhoI fragment of the Pkr gene including complete removal of the 180-nucleotide exon 12. The targeting vector was introduced into the J1 embryonic stem (ES) cell line (strain 129/terSv (40Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar)) by electroporation, and cells were selected with neomycin (200 μg/ml) and 1-(2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-1-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil (0.2 μm; kindly provided by Dr. Michael A. Rudnicki) as described previously (41Megeney L.A. Kablar B. Garrett K. Anderson J.E. Rudnicki M.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the Pkrgene was determined by EcoRI or PstI digestion followed by Southern hybridization with probe A or probe B, respectively (see Fig. 1). To verify that only one copy of each construct was integrated in each targeted ES clone,XhoI-digested DNA was probed with the Neo probe. 3 out of 750 ES clones screened were true homologous recombinants. ES cells that were homozygous for the targeted Pkr allele were obtained by selection of the heterozygous targeted clone 7A8.3 in high neomycin selection (2 mg/ml) as described previously (42Jakobovits A. Vergara G.J. Kennedy J.L. Hales J.F. McGuinness R.P. Casentini-Borocz D.E. Brenner D.G. Otten G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2551-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Of 20 resistant colonies picked, one clone (7A8.3.7) was homozygous mutant. Chimeric mice were generated by microinjection of ES cells with a disrupted Pkr gene into Balb/c donor blastocysts and subsequent implantation into CD-1 foster mothers. Chimeric animals were tested for germ-line transmission of the agouti coat phenotype of 129/Sv-derived ES cells by crossing with Balb/C mice. Heterozygote individuals were identified by genotyping and then intercrossed to generate homozygous lines. Total RNA was isolated from various ES cells that were untreated or treated with 500 units/ml interferon α and β (Cytimmune) for 16 h. Poly(A)+ RNA was selected on an oligo(dT)-cellulose (Life Technologies, Inc.) column. 6 μg of mRNA was resolved on an agarose-formaldehyde gel, blotted, and hybridized with a murine PKR cDNAStuI/SspI fragment corresponding to nucleotides 290–1621 that encode residues 98–515. The blot was washed at high stringency and imaged on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The blot was stripped and reprobed with the mouse glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA, washed, and exposed. After stripping the blot again, it was hybridized with an MluI/BamHI fragment of the neomycin gene, washed, and exposed as above. IFN inducibility of 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase was assessed by rehybridizing this blot with the 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase cDNA. Primary MEF cultures were established from E13 embryos as described previously (40Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). Cells were genotyped as above. Wild-type and homozygous-null ES and MEF cells were lysed in Lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmsodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100), lysates denatured, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. PKR polypeptides were analyzed by immunoblotting with antisera (anti-TikMAP2) raised against a multiple antigen peptide (MAP) bearing mPKR residues 101–114 and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Alternatively, cell lysates were incubated with poly(I)·poly(C) (pIC)-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C with rotation to allow binding, washed in lysis buffer, eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted. dsRNA binding PKR polypeptides were visualized with antisera (anti-Tik100) raised against His-tagged mPKR residues 1–98 and ECL. Immune complex kinase reactions were performed by incubating lysates from various cells with the anti-Tik100A antisera and recovering the immune complex with protein A-Sepharose beads. The complexes were resuspended in reaction mixtures of kinase buffer with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 10 ng/μl reovirus dsRNA and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Autophosphorylation activity of PKR was visualized by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Bone marrow from age-matched mice was harvested by flushing tibias under sterile conditions. An aliquot of cells was obtained, and erythrocytes were removed by lysis in hypotonic solution, and viable nucleated marrow cells were counted using a hemocytometer and trypan blue. Cells were resuspended in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium/methyl cellulose supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 0.09% bovine serum albumin, and cytokines as noted below. 8 × 104 cells were plated in 1 ml of media in 35-mm2 Petri dishes and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 10 days. Erythroid and myeloid colonies were counted, and colony-forming units (CFU) were determined after 10 days. Recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo) was used at 2 units/ml, recombinant murine IL-3 at 10 μg/ml, human Kit ligand (KL) from conditioned media at 3% (v/v), and human granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor at 100 ng/ml. CV-1,L-929, wild-type, or Pkr-null cells were plated in duplicate at 2 × 105 cells per well in 6-well tissue culture plates. The next day, cells were infected with trypsin-treated wild-type vaccinia virus (WR strain) at an m.o.i. of 10 for 1 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, monolayers were rinsed and the inoculum replaced with media. At 4, 8, 12, 15, and 18 h after infection, cells were frozen at −80 °C. Cells were scraped off in 0.3 ml of serum-free media and freeze-thawed twice before trypsinization and serial dilution. Plaque assays were performed, and after 2 days of incubation, plates were fixed, stained with crystal violet, and plaques counted to determine the number of pfus/ml of cell lysate as a function of time after infection. Five-week-oldPkr +/O heterozygous control, Clk1-null, 2P. I. Duncan and J. C. Bell, unpublished observations. andPkr-null mice were anesthetized with halothane and infected by intra-nasal inoculation with 50 μl of serial dilutions of the W29 strain of influenza in phosphate-buffered saline. Each group contained 8–12 animals that were monitored daily over a 10-day period. The W29 strain is pneumovirulent for mice due to mutations selected on mouse adaptation of the prototype human influenza A strain, A/FM/1/47 (43Smeenk C.A. Brown E.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 530-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Influenza virus stocks were prepared in chicken embryo allantoic cavity, and infectivity titers were assessed by plaque assay on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (43Smeenk C.A. Brown E.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 530-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LD50 value of the virus in the control and Pkr-null animals was assessed by Karber-Spearman analysis. Influenza virus growth in mouse lung was determined from pools of three mice from each group. Wild-type andPkr-null MEFs were plated at 2 × 105 cells per well in 6-well tissue culture plates and either left untreated or treated with 500 units/ml IFN-α and -β overnight. Monolayers were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and then infected with influenza A/HK/1/68 (H3N2) virus in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline at multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5, 10, or 25 versusmock-infected for 30 min at 37 °C. Twenty-four hours later, cells were harvested and assayed for apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC staining (CLONTECH). After incubation of cells with the Annexin V reagent for 10 min, stained cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACS instrument for percentage cells with elevated FITC fluorescence indicating apoptosis. 4 × 105 MEFs were plated in 60-mm2 tissue culture plates and treated the next day with 50–2500 ng/ml actinomycin D for 24 h to establish minimal cytostatic dose and ensure Pkr-null cells responded comparably to control cells. Cell viability was determined by trypsinizing cells and trypan blue staining. Actinomycin D toxicity was not as profound as described previously (38Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and was comparable in the two cell types. TNF-α, LPS, and poly(I)·poly(C) synthetic dsRNA (pIC) induction of apoptosis in wild-type MEFs was examined by treating these cells as above with 20 ng/ml TNF-α, 100 ng/ml LPS, and 100 μg/ml pIC with increasing amounts of actinomycin D for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by trypan blue staining and verified by TUNEL assay (Boehringer Mannheim) or morphology under Hoechst staining. TNF-α-induced apoptosis in these MEFs required actinomycin D co-treatment. The apoptotic dose response to TNF-α was determined in PKR-null cells by treating cells with actinomycin D (500 ng/ml) and between 0.1 to 20 ng/ml TNF-α for 24 h. Experiments were conducted at least in triplicate. Immortalized pools of Pkr-null and wild-type cells were washed and lysed in RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After clearing the lysate, 20 μg of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphorylation of eIF-2α was determined by immunoblot with a polyclonal anti-eIF-2α phosphoserine 51 antibody, whereas protein levels of eIF-2α were determined with a monoclonal antibody to eIF-2α. Normalization of protein levels was with anti-actin antibody. We designed a targeting vector such that it would replace exon 12 of PKR (following the nomenclature of Kuhen et al. (39Kuhen K.L. Shen X. Carlisle E.R. Richardson A.L. Weier H.U. Tanaka H. Samuel C.E. Genomics. 1996; 36: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)) with an HSV TK gene promoter-driven neomycin resistance cassette in an orientation opposite to the Pkr promoter (Fig.1 A). Exon 12 encodes subdomains V and VI of the catalytic domain and is essential for enzyme activity (30Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Transfected ES cells were grown in selection media, picked, and screened for true homologous recombinants (Fig.1 B and data not shown) by Southern blot analysis. Targeted cell lines showed the predicted sized fragment for single site integration as detected by the internal neomycin probe (Fig.1 B). Selected ES cells were microinjected into blastocysts from BALB/C mice, implanted into foster mothers, and gave rise to chimeric animals. These were bred with wild-type BALB/C mice to produce heterozygotes which were then interbred to yield progeny with wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous null genotypes. The frequency of wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous animals was 0.24, 0.57, and 0.19, respectively (Table I). As with the amino-terminal targeted Pkr mouse (25Yang Y. Reis L.F.L. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R.G. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), no tumors have arisen in homozygous mice targeted at the PKR catalytic domain after a year.Table IGenotype of progeny of heterozygote and homozygote self-crossesHeterozygous-heterozygous crossesPkr +/+Pkr +/0Pkr 0/0nAverage litter size3788291547.0Homozygous-homozygous crossesPkr 0/0nAverage litter size61618.7Several mating pairs of either heterozygotes (upper panel) or homozygotes (lower panel) were bred and their offspring genotyped by Southern analysis.

An ES cell line (7A8.3.7) that was homozygousPkr 0/0 was selected from the heterozygous mutant cell line, 7A8.3, as described previously (42Jakobovits A. Vergara G.J. Kennedy J.L. Hales J.F. McGuinness R.P. Casentini-Borocz D.E. Brenner D.G. Otten G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2551-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), using higher dose G418 selection (Fig. 1 B). These cell lines and primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from homozygous null animals were assessed for PKR activity. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+-selected RNA from wild-type ES cells showed the normal pattern of murine PKR transcripts of 6, 4, and 2.5 kb that are induced 2.5–3-fold in IFN-treated cells (Fig.2 (44Icely P.L. Gros P. Bergeron J.J.M. Devault A. Afar D.E.H. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16073-16077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The 4- and 6-kb and larger minor mPKR transcripts appear to be incompletely spliced since they hybridize to an intron-spanning riboprobe (data not shown). HeterozygousPkr +/0 cells showed similar expression of transcripts. Homozygous Pkr 0/0 cells completely lacked the fully spliced mature 2.5-kb transcript as well as the incompletely spliced 6-kb transcript (Fig. 2). However, a transcript of about 4 kb and which appeared IFN-inducible was found in all cells. Reprobing of this blot with the neomycin probe showed this transcript in Pkr 0/0 cells bore neomycin sequence (Fig. 2,right panel) not found in the 4-kb transcript in wild-type cells and thus represented a novel transcript that was derived from the targeted allele. Since the 4-kb transcript in wild-type cells does not hybridize with the neomycin probe, the transcript seen inPkr 0/0 cells arises from the targeted allele and coincidentally comigrates with the 4-kb wild-type transcript. The HSV TK promoter-derived neomycin transcript is also detected by the neomycin probe as a smaller transcript of about 900 base pairs. The IFN inducibility of the 4-kb novel transcript inPkr 0/0 cells suggests it is likelyPkr promoter-derived with read-through into the neomycin cassette. This was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis which detects the proximal intron XI and strand-specific riboprobe hybridization which identifies the distal intron XII in this transcript (data not shown). If splicing variants that splice over the neomycin cassette exist, such transcripts would encounter frameshifts in all downstream exons (39Kuhen K.L. Shen X. Carlisle E.R. Richardson A.L. Weier H.U. Tanaka H. Samuel C.E. Genomics. 1996; 36: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 45Tanaka H. Samuel C.E. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 153: 283-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The above observations show that targeted disruption of Pkr with our strategy generates alleles that do not produce the normal PKR transcripts and could at most produce message with premature stop codons in the region encoding the catalytic domain of PKR. Western blot analysis of cell lysates from wild-type andPkr 0/0 ES cells and primary MEFs using the antibody raised against murine PKR residues 101–114 (anti TikMAP2) show no mature murine PKR of 65 kDa (Fig.3 A) detectable in the homozygous targeted cell lines. No truncated PKR polypeptide is apparent either, even with 10-fold excess loadings (data not shown). We attempted to increase the sensitivity of detection by enriching for PKR polypeptides with intact RNA binding capacity by incubating lysates with pIC-agarose then immunoblotting for bound PKR polypeptides. Wild-type and Pkr +/0 cells show murine PKR binding to dsRNA that is detectable by another antibody raised to murine PKR residues 1–98 (anti-Tik100; Fig. 3 B).Pkr 0/0 cells, however, have no detectable mature or truncated PKR polypeptides. An immune complex kinase autophosphorylation assay using this same antibody, with dsRNA as an activator, was performed on cell extracts fromPkr 0/0 cells. No functional PKR activity was detectable in Pkr 0/0 cells of either ES or MEF origin (Fig. 4). Analysis by cell extract kinase assay without use of our antibodies also revealed no IFN-inducible, dsRNA-activated 65-kDa phosphoprotein inPkr-null cells (data not shown). These results provide convincing evidence that the strategy of catalytic disruption ofPkr by targeting exon 12 leads t"
https://openalex.org/W2140347837,"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by neurodegeneration and deposition of βA4, a peptide that is proteolytically released from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Missense mutations in the genes coding for APP and for the polytopic membrane proteins presenilin (PS) 1 and PS2 have been linked to familial forms of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Overexpression of presenilins, especially that of PS2, induces increased susceptibility for apoptosis that is even more pronounced in cells expressing presenilin mutants. Additionally, presenilins themselves are targets for activated caspases in apoptotic cells. When we analyzed APP in COS-7 cells overexpressing PS2, we observed proteolytic processing close to the APP carboxyl terminus. Proteolytic conversion was increased in the presence of PS2-I, which encodes one of the known PS2 pathogenic mutations. The same proteolytic processing occurred in cells treated with chemical inducers of apoptosis, suggesting a participation of activated caspases in the carboxyl-terminal truncation of APP. This was confirmed by showing that specific caspase inhibitors blocked the apoptotic conversion of APP. Sequence analysis of the APP cytosolic domain revealed a consensus motif for group III caspases ((IVL)ExD). Mutation of the corresponding Asp664 residue abolished cleavage, thereby identifying APP as a target molecule for caspase-like proteases in the pathways of programmed cellular death.

Mutation of the corresponding Asp664 residue abolished cleavage, thereby identifying APP as a target molecule for caspase-like proteases in the pathways of programmed cellular death. amyloid precursor protein familial Alzheimer's disease presenilin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis monoclonal antibody fluoromethylketone 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine bis[2-hydroxyethyl]iminotris[hydroxymethyl]methane Neurodegeneration in selected brain regions is one of the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease, together with amyloid deposition in extracellular plaques, congophilic angiopathy, and intracellular tangles. Amyloid deposited in senile plaques is mainly composed of βA4, a peptide consisting of 40–42 residues, which derives by proteolytic processing from its cognate precursor protein termed APP1 (1Kang J.

Mutations in the APP gene cause a rare form of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) by raising the levels of total βA4 or by increasing the ratio of the longer form of βA4 that ends at residue 42 to the form ending at residue 40 (2Citron M.

The corresponding caspase-derived fragments have been detected in all tissues and stages of animal development, suggesting a role of PS processing in the cellular response to apoptotic signals (19Loetscher H.R.

Furthermore, overexpression of PS2 in transfected cells has been shown to increase susceptibility to apoptotic cell death. The latter is even more pronounced in cells expressing mutant PS2-I that encodes one of the known PS2 missense mutations changing Asn141 into Ile (22Wolozin B. Iwasaki K. Vito P. Ganjei J.K. Lacana E. Sunderland T. Zhao B. Kusiak J.W. Wasco W. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 274: 1710-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 23Janicki S. Monteiro M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When we analyzed carboxyl-terminal fragments of APP in cells coexpressing PS2 or PS2-I, we observed proteolytic processing of APP within the cytoplasmic domain that was augmented for mutated PS2-I (see below). To determine whether this result could be attributed to apoptotic pathways and whether APP proteolysis was mediated by caspases, cells expressing full-length APP and amino-terminal-truncated fragments were analyzed after the induction of apoptosis with different compounds including staurosporine and doxorubicin. We report here that proteolytic conversion of APP within its cytoplasmic domain is increased in apoptotic cells and is inhibited by the addition of specific caspase inhibitors. These results suggest that APP is a target for caspase-like proteases and is involved in apoptotic pathways. The cloning of PS2 and construction of mutant PS2-I have been described previously (24Weidemann A. Paliga K. Dürrwang U. Czech C. Evin G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The point mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of SPA4CT (25Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Mönning U. Urmoneit B. Turner J. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (SPA4CTD/A and SPA4CTdel664) were introduced by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). The open reading frames of the resulting constructs were verified by sequencing, followed by cloning into the expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen). Because of the aberrant electrophoretic mobility of SPA4CTD/A protein on SDS-PAGE, the corresponding pCEP4 derivative was again sequenced to exclude any additional mutations during the cloning procedure. The APP derivatives APPD/A and APPdel664 were derived from the corresponding SPA4CT clones by using a unique EcoRI site within the βA4 coding region. Jurkat J16 T cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. COS-7 cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (24Weidemann A. Paliga K. Dürrwang U. Czech C. Evin G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Stably expressing cell lines were generated by CaPO4 transfection of cells with the corresponding pCEP4 derivatives followed by selection with hygromycin (250 μg/ml). In transient transfection experiments, cells were used the following day. Apoptosis was induced for the time periods indicated by adding either staurosporine (2 μm in dimethyl sulfoxide) or doxorubicin (100 μm in distilled water) in serum-free medium. Caspase inhibitors DEVD-CHO, YVAD-CHO, IETD-CHO, and zVAD-fmk were purchased from Bachem or Biomol and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide as 100 mm stock solutions. Cells were pretreated for 45 min with the corresponding inhibitor before the addition of staurosporine or doxorubicin. For in vitro experiments, COS-7 cells transfected with SPA4CT were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody W02. The immunoprecipitated SPA4CT was incubated with recombinant, purified caspase-3 and caspase-8 (final concentration, 2 units/μl) for 30 min at 30 °C under mild agitation in 25 μl of assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mmdithiothreitol). Apoptosis analysis was performed by using an Annexin V-FLUOS detection kit (Boehringer). After stimulating apoptosis, about 106cells were pelleted, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 200 μl of binding buffer containing 4 μl of propidium iodide and 4 μl of Annexin V-FLUOS. Data were collected from 10,000 cells with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) fluorescence accelerated cell scanner using the data acquisition program CELLQuest. For immunoblotting, cells were harvested, resuspended in 8m urea, briefly sonified, and boiled with SDS sample buffer. SPA4CT-containing samples were separated on either 10–16.5% SDS Tris-Tricine gradient gels or 12% Bis-Tris gels (Novex) followed by immunodetection with monoclonal anti-βA4 antibody W02, which recognizes the amino-terminal region of βA4 (26Ida N.

For Western blotting of APP, samples were separated on 7.5% Tris-glycine gels and immunodetected with mAb 22C11. Radioactive labeling of cells, immunoprecipitation with polyclonal rabbit anti-A4CT antiserum and anti-CT and anti-APP antiserum, and immunodetection of PS2 were performed as described previously (24Weidemann A.

Structurally, APP represents a type I integral membrane protein with a large ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Fig.1; numbered according to Ref. 1Kang J. Lemaire H.G.

In COS-7 cells stably transfected with an expression vector encoding APP695, most of the cellular APP695 was detected as a band of about 95 kDa that corresponds to the immature, N-glycosylated species (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). Additionally, signals at 100–120 kDa were observed that represent posttranslationally modified APP species derived by successive transport of APP through the Golgi apparatus and including O-glycosylation, sulfation, and phosphorylation (27Weidemann A.

A, proteolytic conversion of APP695 in cells undergoing programmed cell death. COS-7 cells stably transfected with APP695 expression vector (lanes 2–5) were treated for 8 h with 2 μm staurosporine (lane 4) or 100 ng/ml doxorubicin (lane 5) in serum-free medium (lanes 3–5). For comparison, cells were cultivated in serum-free media (lane 3) or in fetal calf serum-containing media (lanes 1 and 2). Inlane 1, vector-transfected COS-7 cells were analyzed as a control. The band of about 100 kDa represents APP751 that is endogenously expressed by COS-7 cells (lane 1). APP695 was detected in the cell homogenates after immunoprecipitation with anti-APP (lanes 2–5) or anti-CT antiserum (lanes 6 and 7) followed by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with mAb 22C11. Epitope mapping of the APP isoforms reveals that the lower molecular mass species at about 90 kDa is not immunoreactive with anti-CT antiserum (lanes 6and 7). The endogenously encoded APP751(lane 1) is also detected in lane 8 after prolonged ECL exposition (data not shown).B, conversion of SPA4CT in apoptotic cells. Cells were transiently transfected with SPA4CT cDNA (lanes 2 and 3), followed by metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine for 7 h and immunoprecipitation with anti-βA4 mAb W02. Increased conversion of SPA4CT into the 8-kDa species is observed in staurosporine-treated cells (lane 2).C, proteolytic conversion of SPA4CT in cells overexpressing PS2 and PS2-I. COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding SPA4CT alone (lane 1) or in combination with PS2 (lanes 2 and 4) and mutated PS2-I (lanes 3 and 5). In lanes 2 and 3, a 1:1 stoichiometry of expression vectors was used, whereas in lanes 4 and 5, the cells were transfected with only one-tenth of PS2- and PS2-I-encoding plasmids. After radiolabeling the cells with [35S]methionine for 6 h, SPA4CT was immunoprecipitated with mAb W02 followed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To induce apoptotic cell death, cells were treated with either staurosporine or doxorubicin. APP analysis revealed the apparition of an additional band at about 90 kDa (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and5). To test whether this band represents a carboxyl-terminal-truncated species of APP, immunoprecipitations were performed with an antiserum directed against the carboxyl terminus of APP. The 90-kDa band was not recognized, suggesting that the APP carboxyl terminus was cleaved in apoptotic cells (Fig. 2, lanes 6–8). For further analysis, the last 103 carboxyl-terminal residues of APP, which extend from the amino terminus of βA4 to the very end of the APP cytoplasmic domain and mimic the β-secretase carboxyl-terminal product (Fig. 1, A4CT), were expressed in COS-7 cells. This amino-terminal-truncated derivative of APP allowed a more accurate investigation of the site of cleavage because of the lower molecular weight and the higher resolution of the corresponding peptide on SDS gels. To ensure correct membrane insertion, a signal peptide was fused to the amino terminus (SPA4CT (25Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Mönning U. Urmoneit B. Turner J. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)). After metabolic labeling of the cells, the expressed peptide was immunoprecipitated with mAb W02, which is directed to βA4 residues 1–16 (26Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schröder J. Zerfass R. Förstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22908-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The antibody detected SPA4CT as a band of 12 kDa (Fig. 2 B, lane 3), a result consistent with earlier studies (25Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Mönning U. Urmoneit B. Turner J. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Additionally, a second band of about 8 kDa was detected in nonapoptotic cells after immunoprecipitation with this antibody, suggesting that this band represents a carboxyl-terminal-truncated species lacking the last 20–30 residues of the APP sequence as deduced from the differences in the relative molecular masses. Treatment of cells with staurosporine resulted in a strong increase in the relative intensity of the 8-kDa species (Fig.2 B, lane 2), suggesting elevated processing of SPA4CT within its cytoplasmic domain in apoptotic cells. Because overexpression of PS2 has been reported to stimulate apoptotic pathways in cells, we analyzed the conversion of SPA4CT in cells that were cotransfected with a PS2-encoding expression plasmid. Additionally, PS2-I was coexpressed, which encodes one of the two known missense mutations (Asn141 to Ile) within the PS2 gene causative for early-onset Alzheimer's disease (10Levy-Lahad E. Wasco W. Pookaj P. Romano D. Oshima J. Pettingell P. Yu C. Jondro P.D. Schmidt S.D. Wang K. Crowley A.C. Fu Y.-H. Guenette S.Y. Galas D. Nemens E. Wijsman E.M. Bird T.D. Schellenberg G.D. Tanzi R.E.

Expression of PS2 and PS2-I was monitored by immunoprecipitating lysates from radiolabeled cells with anti-PS2 antiserum, as described previously (Ref. 24Weidemann A. Paliga K. Dürrwang U. Czech C. Evin G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar; data not shown). In the first experiment, both PS2 and SPA4CT cDNA-encoding plasmids were transiently cotransfected in an equal ratio. Here, the relative intensity of the 8-kDa band compared with the 12-kDa band was increased (Fig. 2 C, lane 2). A similar result was obtained with the cells cotransfected with PS2-I (lane 3). In a second experiment, PS2 cDNA and SPA4CT cDNA at a ratio of 0.1:1 were expressed in the cells. Under these conditions, mutant PS2-I was still able to induce an increased conversion of SPA4CT into the 8-kDa species (lane 5). In contrast, cells cotransfected with low amounts of wild-type PS2 showed a pattern indistinguishable from that of the cells expressing solely SPA4CT (lane 4). This finding is consistent with reports that cells that overexpress mutant PS2-I are more prone to undergo apoptosis than cells expressing wild-type PS2 (22Wolozin B. Iwasaki K. Vito P. Ganjei J.K. Lacana E. Sunderland T. Zhao B. Kusiak J.W. Wasco W. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 274: 1710-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 23Janicki S. Monteiro M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To further characterize the proteolytic processing of the APP cytoplasmic domain, pulse-chase experiments were performed in the presence of staurosporine and doxorubicin (Fig.3 A). Before the induction of cell death, almost all SPA4CT was detected as a 12-kDa species (lanes 1 and 4). After induction with staurosporine for 9 h, about 50% of SPA4CT was converted into the 8-kDa fragment (lane 2). Incubation for 30 h caused a decrease in the intensities of both SPA4CT and the 8-kDa fragment, a result attributed to the lower synthesis of SPA4CT in dying cells (lane 3). A similar precursor-product relationship between SPA4CT and its 8-kDa fragment was observed in doxorubicin-treated cells (lanes 4–6). To determine whether a caspase was involved in the cleavage of the APP cytoplasmic domain under apoptotic conditions, a subset of caspase inhibitors was used such as a caspase-1-type inhibitor (YVAD-CHO), a caspase-3-type inhibitor (DEVD-CHO), a caspase-8-type inhibitor (IETD-CHO), and a broad spectrum inhibitor (zVAD-fmk). Of the three tetrapeptide inhibitors, only IETD-CHO showed a clear inhibition of the conversion of SPA4CT into the 8-kDa species (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–5). zVAD-fmk (lane 6) was the most potent inhibitor, probably because it can block all caspase activity by also inhibiting the upstream caspases in the proteolytic activation cascade, whereas IETD-CHO, due to its relative specificity, blocks the total activity of the group III caspases less effectively. Therefore, zVAD-fmk was then tested at lower concentrations. Reduced proteolytic conversion of SPA4CT into the 8-kDa fragment was observed at concentrations ranging between 3.3 and 100 μm (Fig. 3 C). This result again demonstrates the participation of activated caspases in the apoptotic processing of APP. To directly demonstrate the ability of activated caspases to cleave the APP carboxyl terminus, SPA4CT immunoprecipitated from radioactively labeled COS-7 cells was incubated with purified, recombinant caspase-3 and caspase-8 (Fig.3 D). Incubation with buffer alone was used as a control and showed no cleavage (lane 1). Incubation with caspase-8 resulted in the formation of two fragments of about 8 and 6 kDa (lane 3). After a 30-min incubation, a 75% conversion of SPA4CT was observed in the presence of caspase-8 (lane 3), whereas a conversion of about only 20% occurred in the presence of caspase-3 (lane 2). The lower molecular mass band apparently represents the APP 31-residue carboxyl-terminal fragment resulting from caspase cleavage. The rate of the caspase-8-mediated conversion is in the same order of magnitude as that described for the in vitro cleavage of Bid, a proximal substrate of caspase-8 in the Fas and TNF apoptotic signaling pathway (28Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 29Li H. Zhu H. Xu C. Yuan J.

This result proves formally that activated caspases, especially caspase-8, are capable of cleaving the APP cytoplasmic domain. Examination of the cytoplasmic domain of APP revealed the presence of a consensus sequence for caspases: the sequence VEVD664 (numbered according to APP695; Ref. 1Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A.

To test whether the observed proteolytic processing of the APP cytoplasmic domain occurs at residue Asp664, two constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction: in one clone, Asp664 was mutated into Ala (SPA4CTD/A), whereas in the other clone, a stop codon was introduced after Asp664, thereby terminating translation after this residue (SPA4CTdel664). Both constructs were expressed in cells, followed by analysis with anti-βA4 antibody (Fig.4 A). In contrast to nonmutated SPA4CT (lanes 1 and 2), a single band was observed for the D664A mutant (lane 3) even after the induction of apoptosis with staurosporine (lane 4), indicating that the single point mutation completely inhibited proteolytic conversion. The faster migration of SPA4CTD/Aon SDS gels compared with SPA4CT is most likely due to the removal of the negatively charged Asp664 residue, resulting in an altered mobility on SDS-PAGE. A similar increase in mobility has been also observed for other proteins in which the critical Asp residue was mutated into Ala (33Clem R.J. Cheng E.H.Y. Karp C.L. Kirsch D.G. Ueno K. Takahashi A.

The electrophoretic mobility of the deletion mutant SPA4CTdel664 was identical to the 8-kDa fragment generated from wild-type SPA4CT (lane 5). The APP695 derivatives encoding both mutations (APPD/A and APPdel664) were also expressed and studied (Fig. 4 B). In contrast to wild-type APP695 (lanes 1–4), no additional lower molecular mass species at about 90 kDa was detectable for APPD/A (lanes 5–8), even in the presence of staurosporine or doxorubicin, indicating a lack of proteolysis within the cytoplasmic domain (lanes 7 and 8, respectively). APPdel664 displayed the same relative mobility (about 90 kDa) as the carboxyl-terminal-truncated APP695 fragment that is observed in apoptotic cells (lanes 9–12; compare with lanes 3 and4). Neither staurosporine nor doxorubicin altered APPdel664 mobility (lanes 11 and12). To address the question of whether the cleavage events described here occur early or late in the apoptotic pathway"

The functional importance of Pex14p for peroxisome biogenesis is further supported by its interaction with Pex13p and with an additional membrane bound peroxin Pex17p (13Huhse B. Rehling P.

An understanding of peroxisomal protein import at the molecular level requires knowledge about the structure of the peroxins and conformational changes resulting from their interactions. Herein, we report initial biochemical and biophysical studies of the human PTS1 receptor PEX5, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and its interaction with PEX14. Cloning experiments were performed withE. coli strain DH5α. The cDNA fragments coding for PEX5L, PEX5S, and the truncated versions PEX5L-(1–251) and PEX5L-(323–639) were from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) derived plasmids. 2G. Dodt, D. Warren, T. Yahraus, M. Soukupova, E. Becker, P. Rehling, and S. J. Gould, manuscript in preparation. A polymerase chain reaction product corresponding to PEX5L-(214–639) was amplified from pGD106 (20Braverman N. Dodt G. Gould S.J. Valle D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) using the sense primer 5′-ATTGTCGACCATGGAGTTCCTGAAATTC-3′ containing aNcoI site (underlined) and a vector-specific antisense primer corresponding to the Sp6 promotor region (5′-TATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′). DNA fragments encoding full-length PEX5L, PEX5S, and the C-terminal fragments PEX5L-(214–639) and PEX5L-(323–639) were digested withNcoI/BglII. The resulting fragments, which also contained additional 218 base pairs from the 3′-noncoding region and anNcoI/NotI fragment corresponding to PEX5L-(1–251), were subcloned into expression plasmids kindly provided by G. Stier (EMBL, Heidelberg). These plasmids were derived from pET9d (Novagen) by replacing the unique NcoI site with a DNA fragment encoding a hexahistidinyl (His6) tag and a TEV (tobacco etch virus) protease cleavage site and containing several unique endonuclease recognition sites. The PEX5 coding fragments were ligated with NcoI/BamHI orNcoI/NotI digested vectors, thus, fusing a peptide with the sequence MKHHHHHHPMSDYDIPTTENLYFQGAM to the N termini of the PEX5 proteins. A DNA fragment encoding GST-PEX14-(1–78) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pGEX-PEX14-(1–134) 3Will, G., Soukupova, M., Hong, X., Erdmann, K. S., Kiel, J. A. K.

The DNA constructs were verified by restriction analysis and partial DNA sequence analysis using an ABI automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). A nucleotide exchange was found in the coding region for PEX5L-(1–251), resulting in an amino acid substitution of glutamic acid to aspartic acid at position 33. Expression of His6-tagged PEX5 forms and GST-PEX14-(1–78) was carried out in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Fresh transformants were grown in Luria Broth medium supplemented with 30 mg/liter kanamycin or 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Cells were induced in the mid-log phase with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for another 4–6 h at a temperature of 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and were stored at −80 °C. Cell pellets were thawed in buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and broken with a French pressure cell (Aminco) in one or two passages. Cell debris and other insoluble material were removed by centrifugation (44,000 × g, 45 min). The supernatant containing the soluble proteins was loaded directly on either a Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) or a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) column equilibrated with buffer A. PEX5L-(323–639) was purified from inclusion bodies on Ni-NTA-agarose columns under denaturing conditions as described in the QIAexpress system instructions (Qiagen). PEX5 proteins were eluted from Ni-NTA-agarose with 60 mm imidazole. For GST-PEX14-(1–78) bound to glutathione-Sepharose a single-step elution with 10 mm glutathione was performed. All affinity purification steps were carried out at 4 °C and monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis. Protease cleavage was performed at 37 °C for 4 h. Thrombin (Serva) was used at a concentration of 3 NIH units/mg of purified GST-PEX14-(1–78), whereas 0.1 NIH units of TEV protease (Life Technologies, Inc.)/mg of PEX5 proteins effectively cleaved off the His6 tag. The thrombin activity was inactivated with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min at 37 °C. A Mono Q ion exchange column (HR5/5, Pharmacia) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT was used to remove proteases and fusion parts and to concentrate the recombinant proteins. For that purpose PEX14-(1–78) was eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient between 0 and 120 mm NaCl, whereas for all recombinant PEX5 proteins, 20-ml linear gradients from 150 to 800 mm NaCl were applied. Size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superose 6 or a Superose 12 column HR 10/30 (Pharmacia) with buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 20 °C. Molecular mass standards were thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and glutathione S-transferase (GST, 52 kDa), respectively. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-denatured proteins were separated by standard PAGE (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) or Tricine-PAGE according to the method of Schägger and von Jagow (23Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) and visualized by Coomassie Blue or silver stain (24Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 1: 28-32Crossref Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Protein solutions were adjusted to concentrations of 0.1–1 mg/ml and applied onto glow discharged 400 mesh carbon-coated grids for 1 min. Grids were flashed with 150 μl of buffer and stained with a drop of 1% (w/v) aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 s. Excess stain was removed by flash washing. The blotted and air-dried grids were examined in a Philips 400T Transmission Electron Microscope operating at 80 kV. Studies on the interaction between the PEX5 proteins and GST-PEX14-(1–78) were performed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (BIAcore AB). Here one binding partner, referred to as the ligand, is immobilized on a sensor chip, and the interaction with an interactant in free solution, the analyte, is detected. Changes in the mass concentration on the sensor surface are proportional to changes in the refractive index of the sensor surface. This refractive index change is monitored by using the physical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance and expressed in response units (RU), whereas 1000 RU correspond to a change in surface concentration of about 1 ng of protein/mm2 (25Stenberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbaniczky C. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1991; 143: 513-526Crossref Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Anti-GST antibodies (Code number BR-1002-23, BIAcore AB) were coupled to the surface to a total response of 3000 RU by standard amine coupling following the manufacturers' instructions. Purified GST-PEX14-(1–78) at a concentration of 0.09 mg/ml was captured to an immobilization level of about 400 RU to a CM5 sensor chips via anti-GST antibodies. All interaction experiments were carried out in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl at a constant flow rate of 30 μl/min. PEX5L, PEX5S, PEX5L-(1–251),and PEX5L-(214–639) were injected in varying concentrations from 500 to 1 nm. Unspecific binding was subtracted using an unmodified sensor surface for each concentration individually. Bulk refractive index changes due to buffer variations were subtracted by using runs without protein. After each interaction cycle the surfaces were regenerated by either two injections (1 min each) with 10 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.2, or one injection with the glycine solution followed by one injection with 0.05% SDS. Association and dissociation phase were both monitored for 5 min. The resulting data were evaluated with the BIAevaluation software version 3.0 (BIAcore AB). The dissociation rate constants were determined separately from the binding curves obtained for the highest concentration of the respective PEX5 protein. The data from 5 to 60 s after injection stop were fitted to Equation 1. R(t)=R0×exp(−kd×(t−t0))Equation 1 Association rate constants were calculated with the previously obtained dissociation rate constants and respective concentrations of analytes according to the pseudo first order model A + B = AB using Equation 2 in global fit analysis. R(t)=kaCRmax/(kaC+kd)×(1−exp[−(ka+kd)×t])Equation 2 The equilibrium binding constants were calculated from the respective rate constants according to Equation 3. KD=kd/kaEquation 3 In these equations the following abbreviations are used:R 0 is the response at the initial timet 0, R(t) is the relative response at a given time t, R max is the maximum analyte binding capacity, C is the molar concentration of the analyte, k a andk d are the association and dissociation rate constants, respectively, and K D is the equilibrium binding constant. It has been reported previously that the PTS1 receptor Pex5p of yeasts and higher eukaryotes can bind to the two peroxins Pex13p (15Gould S.J. Kalish J.E. Morrell J.C. Bjorkman J. Urquhart A.J.

In higher eukaryotes two forms of PEX5 have been reported which differ in an insertion of 37 amino acids as a result of alternative splicing (20Braverman N. Dodt G. Gould S.J. Valle D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,26Otera H. Okumoto K. Tateishi K. Ikoma Y. Matsuda E. Nishimura M. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Ohashi K. Higuchi O. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell.

Genet. 1995; 9: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the structural basis of the interactions of Pex5p with other peroxins, large quantities of homogeneous protein were required. For this purpose we created His6-tagged versions of both, the long and the short form of human PEX5 (Fig.1, PEX5L and PEX5S), and expressed them in E. coli by using a T7 promotor-based expression system. A TEV protease cleavage site was introduced between the His6tag and the PEX5 sequence, allowing the removal of the affinity tag. Expression and purity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. With both recombinant PEX5 forms we obtained high levels of expression (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1and 2). During SDS-PAGE both proteins did not migrate with their calculated molecular masses of 67 kDa (PEX5S) and 71 kDa (PEX5L), respectively, but with an apparent molecular mass of 80 kDa, as had been described previously for PEX5S (27Dodt G. Braverman N. Wong C. Moser A. Moser H.W. Watkins P. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 28Wiemer E.A.C. Nuttley W.M. Bertolaet B.L. Li X. Francke U. Wheelock M.J. Anné U.K. Johnson K.R. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In our studies truncated versions of PEX5 were also used. A similar difference between empirical (45 kDa) and calculated molecular mass (28 kDa) was observed for an N-terminal fragment but not for C-terminal fragments (Fig. 2), suggesting that the aberrant migration is due to the high density of negatively charged residues (about 20%) within the N-terminal half. Both proteins, PEX5L and PEX5S, were virtually completely soluble and could be purified to close homogeneity in one step using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6 and7). The His6 tag was efficiently cleaved off by TEV protease. The protease, degradation products, and minor contaminants were removed by anion exchange chromatography. Typically 20 mg of pure protein could be obtained from one liter bacterial culture. Crystallization experiments have been initiated. Size exclusion chromatography indicated a molecular mass of about 270 kDa for both PEX5 forms (Fig. 3), suggesting a tetramer of identical subunits. The tetrameric assembly of PEX5 was supported by results from electron microscopy. Electron micrographs of negatively stained recombinant PEX5S preparations show numerous particles with a diameter of about 13 nm (Fig.4 A). These particles have the shape of a square with a central stain filled cavity and appear to consist of four subunits. It is important to note that the recombinant PEX5 also tends to form filamentous aggregates, which were detected in the same micrographs. It is noteworthy that their number and size is increased in low salt environment (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that their formation is governed by electrostatic interactions. Similar aggregates consisting of more than 100 molecules have been described for another TPR containing protein (9Hirano T. Kinoshita N. Morikawa K. Yanagida M. Cell. 1990; 60: 319-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar).Figure 4Electron microscopy of recombinant human PEX5.

In order to map the determinants responsible for tetramerization and aggregation of PEX5, three truncated His6-tagged versions, PEX5L-(1–251), PEX5L-(214–639), and PEX5L-(323–639) (Fig. 1), were expressed inE. coli (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3–5), purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Fig. 2 A,lanes 8–10), and subjected to size exclusion chromatography. While the first two proteins were soluble the third one comprising little more than the seven TPR motifs was insoluble and could only be purified under denaturing conditions. Thus, approximately 100 amino acids, which distinguish PEX5L-(214–639) and PEX5L-(323–639), are sufficient to prevent aggregation and render the former protein soluble. Gel filtration analyses suggested an apparent molecular mass of 105 kDa for PEX5L-(1–251), whereas PEX5L-(214–639) behaved like a protein of 45 kDa (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with a tetrameric structure for PEX5L-(1–251), which contains only the N-terminal half of PEX5, and a monomeric structure for PEX5L-(214–639) comprising the C-terminal two-thirds of PEX5. Electron micrographs of negatively stained PEX5L-(1–251) showed particles very similar in shape but smaller in size to those found in preparations of full-length PEX5 (data not shown). However, in contrast to full-length PEX5 no filamentous aggregates were detected. A comparison of the properties determined for the four soluble PEX5 proteins, PEX5L, PEX5S, PEX5L-(1–251), and PEX5L-(214–639), revealed that the presence of the segment between amino acid 214 and 251 does not correspond to the ability to form tetramers. Thus, this structural property is dependent on a determinant located within the first 213 amino acids. Aggregation in contrast seems to be due to the seven TPR motifs. InSaccharomyces cerevisiae interaction of Pex5p and Pex14p was indicated previously by the two-hybrid method leading to the suggestion that Pex14p could be a candidate for the docking protein of the PTS1 receptor at the peroxisomal membrane (14Albertini M.

Deletion analysis mapped the binding site for ScPex5p to the first 58 amino acid residues of ScPex14p. 4K. Niederhoff and W.-H. Kunau, manuscript in preparation. Recently, the human orthologue of ScPex14p was identified and also was shown to interact with PEX5 (19Fransen M. Terlecky S.R. Subramani S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8087-8092Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of all available Pex14p orthologues suggests that the first 58 amino acid residues of ScPex14p correspond to the first 78 amino acid residues of human PEX14 (Fig.5). Thus, we used a fusion protein composed of GST, a thrombin cleavage site, and the first 78 amino acid residues of human PEX14 to demonstrate the direct binding of PEX5 and PEX14 in vitro. The fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and could be purified in high amounts (Fig. 2 B). Lysates of cells expressing either GST-PEX14-(1–78) or His6-PEX5L in similar amounts were mixed and divided into two parts. One aliquot was run through a glutathione-Sepharose column, while the other was subjected to Ni-NTA chromatography. As seen in Fig.6 A, in both cases the identical complex consisting of His6-PEX5L and GST-PEX14-(1–78) could be specifically eluted by glutathione and imidazole, respectively. The binding of PEX5 to the N-terminal fragment of PEX14 was specific, since expression of GST alone instead of GST-PEX14-(1–78) did not recruit His6-PEX5L to the glutathione column (data not shown). We conclude that PEX5 directly binds PEX14. This conclusion was supported by another in vitro binding experiment with purified GST-PEX14-(1–78) and His6-PEX5L. The two proteins were mixed in a molar ratio of 1:6 (PEX5L: GST-PEX14-(1–78)) and subsequently analyzed by sizing chromatography. Fig. 6 B shows that the mixture of the two proteins contained an early eluting species, which is not detectable when each protein was analyzed individually. This high molecular weight complex consisted of GST-PEX14-(1–78) and His6-PEX5 as confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 6 A, lane 4).Figure 6Isolation of in vitro formed complexes between His6-PEX5L and GST-PEX14-(1–78).

Proteins were separated in 12% polyacrylamide gels and visualized with Coomassie Blue. The formation of complexes was carried out in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. For the affinity purification of the complexes by glutathione-Sepharose and by Ni-NTA-agarose, total cell lysates of E. coli expressing His6-PEX5L or GST-PEX14-(1–78) were mixed (lane 1) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 column was performed with a mixture of both affinity purified proteins incubated for 5 min at room temperature.

The kinetics of interaction between PEX5 and the peroxisomal docking protein PEX14 were analyzed using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Both recombinant PEX5 isoforms, PEX5L and PEX5S, bind to the immobilized GST-PEX14-(1–78) with a fast association rate, whereas the dissociation rate is very slow (Fig.7). The calculated equilibrium binding constants are in the low nanomolar range (TableI). Data were also analyzed by steady state analysis (not shown) and found to be in good agreement with those obtained by evaluating the apparent rate constants. Vice versa experiments with His6-tagged PEX5 immobilized on a Ni-NTA sensor chip surface as ligand and GST-PEX14-(1–78) as analyte confirmed the high affinity binding (data not shown).Table IRate and equilibrium binding constants of the interaction of immobilized GST-PEX14-(1–78) and PEX5 proteinsAnalytek ak dK DM−1s−1s−1mPEX5L1.2 × 1060.8 × 10−30.7 × 10−9PEX5S0.4 × 1061.3 × 10−33.3 × 10−9PEX5L-(1–251)1.2 × 1060.8 × 10−30.7 × 10−9PEX5L-(214–639)0.2 × 1061.5 × 10−37.5 × 10−9Association rate constants, k a, dissociation rate constants, k d, and equilibrium binding constants,K D, were determined from surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy using GST-PEX14-(1–78) immobilized to an anti-GST surface as the ligand and the various PEX5 forms as analytes.

In order to determine whether the GST part of GST-PEX14-(1–78) affects the binding with PEX5, the fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin to obtain a 10-kDa fragment PEX14-(1–78) (Fig. 2 B). This allowed in vitro binding experiments with four different forms of PEX5: the long form PEX5L, the short form PEX5S, the N-terminal fragment PEX5L-(1–251), and the C-terminal fragment PEX5L-(214–639). For this purpose the components were mixed and analyzed by sizing chromatography. Fig. 8summarizes the findings. In all four binding experiments PEX14-(1–78) was present in excess. Comparison of the elution profiles obtained with the individual PEX5 proteins in the presence or absence of PEX14-(1–78) revealed that the PEX5 proteins eluted earlier, when PEX14-(1–78) was present, indicating the formation of complexes. SDS-PAGE analyses of the corresponding peak fractions confirmed the presence of both PEX14-(1–78) and the respective PEX5 protein, whereas the unbound PEX14-(1–78) was found as a late peak in all elution profiles. This is shown for PEX5L in Fig. 8. One surprising result was that all soluble forms of PEX5 were able to interact with PEX14-(1–78), suggesting more than one binding site. This is consistent with the findings from surface plasmon resonance analysis that both truncated versions PEX5L-(1–251) and PEX5L-(214–639) bind to GST-PEX14-(1–78) with similar affinity as the long and the short form of PEX5 (Fig. 7 and Table I). Using the apparent molecular masses of PEX14-(1–78), of the different PEX5 proteins, and of their complexes, we estimated the subunit composition of the complexes (Table II). This led to interesting and unexpected results. The tetrameric long and short forms of PEX5 seem to bind seven and six PEX14-(1–78) fragments per subunit, respectively, suggesting that the 37-amino acid insertion (amino acids 215–251) of the long form contains one binding site. The calculated number of binding sites was confirmed by analysis of the complexes formed by the two truncated PEX5 proteins. The tetrameric N-terminal fragment PEX5L-(1–251) seems to bind four fragments of PEX14-(1–78) per subunit, whereas the C-terminal fragment PEX5L-(214–639) binds three or four fragments. As the overlapping region of these two forms of PEX5 contained the insertion (amino acids 215–251) with one putative binding site, their presumed binding sites add up to six or seven.Table IISummary of the results of molecular mass analysis of PEX5 proteins in absence and presence of isolated PEX14-(1–78) fragmentProteinm calcm app− PEX14-(1–78)+ PEX14-(1–78)kDakDaPEX5L71270550PEX5S67270500PEX5L-(1–251)28105270PEX5L-(214–639)474580The apparent molecular masses of PEX5 proteins and their complexes with PEX14-(1–78) were estimated by size exclusion chromatography as shown in Fig. 8. m calc, molecular mass, calculated from the amino acid sequence; m app, apparent molecular mass.

In order to initiate a structural analysis of the import machinery for peroxisomal matrix proteins, we prepared recombinant human PEX5 (PTS1 receptor) and examined its binding to human PEX14 (binding partner at the peroxisomal membrane) in vitro. In these studies we used an N-terminal fragment of PEX14 comprising only the first 78 amino acid residues rather than the full-length protein as the binding site for the PTS1 receptor of S. cerevisiae had been mapped to the corresponding fragment of ScPex14p. 5K. Niederhoff and W.-H. Kunau, manuscript in preparation. Human PEX5, as all other members of the steadily growing Pex5 protein family, is composed of two distinctly different parts, the highly conserved C-terminal half comprising seven TPR motifs and the N-terminal half, which possesses only a few amino acids that are strictly conserved among all members (Fig. 9). While the TPR region was shown to mediate the binding to PTS1-containing proteins (27Dodt G. Braverman N. Wong C. Moser A. Moser H.W. Watkins P. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 29Brocard C. Kragler F. Simon M.M. Schuster T. Hartig A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3627-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), a specific function was not yet assigned to the N-terminal half. In this study we present evidence that the N-terminal half of PEX5 binds PEX14. Recombinant human PEX5 is a soluble protein (Fig. 2) with a tetrameric structure, as judged by sizing chromatography (Fig. 3) and by electron microscopy (Fig. 4). However, it also forms aggregates. As the C-terminal fragment (amino acids 214–639) alone, in contrast to the N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–251), behaves as a monomer the ability to form tetramers appears to be a property of the first 213 amino acids. Conversely, the present data suggest that aggregation could be caused by the TPR motifs. A C-terminal fragment (amino acids 323–639), which consists virtually of nothing else but the TPR motifs is completely insoluble, while the N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–251) does not aggregate. A striking property of the recombinant PEX5 is the occurrence of multiple (at least six or seven per subunit) binding sites for the PEX14 fragment which seem to bind with very high affinity. Interestingly, sequence analysis of PEX5L reveals seven pentapeptide repeats within the segment of amino acids 115–315. These repeats are characterized by the consensus WXXXF/Y. Six of them have been reported to exist in the short form of human PEX5 (27Dodt G. Braverman N. Wong C. Moser A. Moser H.W. Watkins P. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). An alignment of the known Pex5 proteins shows that these repeats are found in each but the number and spacings within the N-terminal half of the molecules differ (Fig. 9). For example, Pex5p of water melon (Citrullus lanatus) possesses nine of these motifs whereas Pex5p of S. cerevisiae contains only two. Sequence analysis of these repeats in all of the orthologues revealed that the first position between the conserved aromatic amino acid residues can be any amino acid, whereas there is a strong preference for hydrophilic residues at the second position and the third position is occupied in 35 out of 36 motifs by aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or glutamine. Secondary structure prediction (32Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for all known Pex5 proteins revealed that the WXXXF/Y motifs are parts of amphipathic α-helices, suggesting that the strictly conserved aromatic residues of tryptophan, phenylalanine, or tyrosine are positioned to the same side of the helix. As the number and distribution of the repeats in human PEX5 closely matches the estimated number of binding sites for the PEX14 fragment in the various PEX5 forms (Table II), it is tempting to speculate that the repeats might provide the structural basis for this interaction. It seems unlikely that all the binding sites found for the PEX14-(1–78) fragment in vitro in the absence of any other possible interacting protein (peroxins and/or cargoproteins) are occupied in vivo by full-length PEX14 simultaneously. It is very difficult to envisage how a protein of this size, and especially with all its predicted partners, could sterically fit into seven binding sites within a segment of about 200 amino acid residues. This then raises the question which function the observed multiple binding sites of PEX5 for PEX14 could have in vivo. One explanation could be that the number of binding sites increases the probability of binding between the two partners without the necessity that they all have to be occupied. In the case that the individual binding sites turn out to have different binding constants, it is conceivable that PEX14 first interacts with low affinity binding sites and is then transferred to the high affinity one(s). To address this possibility additional fragments and mutant forms of PEX5, as well as full-length PEX14, have to be tested. Taken together, the fact that recombinant PEX5 can be obtained in high amounts and successfully used for in vitro binding studies, including surface plasmon resonance analysis, now opens up new ways to study the structural basis of interactions between essential components of peroxisomal protein import. Studies including ternary complexes are in progress.

To date, four subtypes of P1 or adenosine receptors (ARs)1 have been cloned: A1, A2A, A2B, and A3. They all belong to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily (1Tucker A.L. Linden J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). P2 (ATP) receptors are divided into two major subfamilies, the P2X receptors that are ligand-gated channels, and the P2Y receptors that are G protein-coupled (2Schachter J.B. Sromek S.M. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The activation of G protein-coupled purinergic receptors has acute functional effects on all tissues that can be attributed to G protein-mediated effects on enzymes and ion channels. In addition, recent evidence indicates that purinergic receptor activation produces more slowly developing mitogenic, morphogenic, and secretory activities (3Neary J.T. Rathbone M.P. Cattabeni F.

Rev. 1997; 49: 381-402PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that A2BARs, in addition to coupling to Gs and cyclic AMP accumulation, appear to be responsible for triggering acute Ca2+ mobilization and degranulation of canine mast cells (5Auchampach J.A. Jin J. Wan T.C. Caughey G.H. Linden J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 846-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) as well as a delayed interleukin-8 release from human HMC-1 mast cells (6Feoktistov I. Biaggioni I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1979-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). A role for mast cell A2BARs in asthma is suggested by the therapeutic efficacy of theophylline and enprofylline. Both of these xanthines were found to block human A2BARs in the therapeutic dose range, and enprofylline was found to be a selective antagonist of human A2BARs (7Robeva A.S. Woodard R. Jin X. Gao Z. Bhattacharya S. Taylor H.E. Rosin D.L. Linden J. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 39: 243-252Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase probably cannot account for A2BAR-mediated degranulation and stimulation of interleukin-8 synthesis from human HMC-1 mast cells, and in fact cyclic AMP has been found to be inhibitory to rodent mast cell degranulation (8Hughes P.J. Holgate S.T. Church M.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 3847-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 9Hughes P.J. Church M.K. Agents & Actions. 1986; 18: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In mast cells, activation of IgE receptors and adenosine receptors produces a synergistic interaction to trigger degranulation (10Ali H. Cunha-Melo J.R. Saul W.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 745-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IgE receptors are known to activate MAPK in mast cells (11Hirasawa N. Scharenberg A. Yamamura H. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10960-10967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402PubMed Google Scholar), but little is known about the regulation of this signaling pathway by adenosine receptors. The study of mast cell adenosine receptors is complicated by the fact that individual cells express multiple adenosine receptor subtypes. In addition, different adenosine receptor subtypes appear to be functionally predominant in different mast cell lines (5Auchampach J.A. Jin J. Wan T.C. Caughey G.H. Linden J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 846-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 13Hoffman H.M. Walker L.L. Marquardt D.L.

For this reason we decided to initially characterize functional effects of the endogenous A2BAR in HEK-293 cells where it is the only adenosine receptor expressed. ERK1/2 are 44- and 42-kDa isoform members of the MAPK family that regulate gene expression, protein synthesis, cell growth, secretion, and differentiation (15Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 16Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). MAP kinase signaling was initially shown to be activated by single-transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinases, such as the EGF and platelet-derived growth factor receptors. In recent years, a number of mitogenic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists including lysophosphatidic acid (17Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), angiotensin II (18Sadoshima J. Qiu Z. Morgan J.P. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), endothelin (19Wang Y. Pouyssegur J. Dunn M.J. J. Cardiovasc.

J. 1993; 289: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have been shown to be capable of potently activating ERK. In contrast to receptor tyrosine kinases, the intermediate steps linking GPCRs to the activation of ERK are poorly understood, and significant heterogeneity and complexity exist in the signaling pathways utilized by various GPCRs(22). It is now widely believed that the mechanism of ERK activation by GPCRs varies among cell types and individual receptors (23Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In the present study we show that activation of HEK-293 cell adenosine receptors stimulates adenylyl cyclase, Ca2+mobilization, and ERK1/2 activation. ERK activation is Ras-dependent, but is not blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) or tyrosine kinases, and differs from ERK activation elicited by UTP acting on a P2Y2 receptor. We also demonstrate that A2BARs are principally responsible for initiating a sustained ERK activation in canine mastocytoma cells.

Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-ERK2 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-B-Raf (C-19) and anti-Raf-1 (C-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Pan-Ras antibody (F111) was purchased from Santa Cruz. pcDNA3 was from Invitrogen. FLAG-tagged ERK2 was provided by Dr. S. T. Eblen. pcDNA-Ras(N17) was constructed by ligating a 0.9-kilobaseXbaI/StuI fragment from pAT-Ras(N17)(25) intoNheI/PmeI-digested pcNDA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). HEK-293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Canine BR mastocytoma cells were maintained in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% donor calf serum, 1.5 mml -histidine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfection of HEK-293 cells was performed on 90% confluent monolayers in 100-mm plates by means of LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol. Empty pcDNA3 vector was added to keep the total mass of DNA added per plate constant. ERK1/2 activation assays were performed approximately 30 h after transfection. HEK-293 cells were washed twice and resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 unit/ml adenosine deaminase, and 20 μm of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, and then aliquoted into test tubes. Compounds in 50-μl aliquots were added to 200 μl of cell suspension and transferred to a 37 °C shaker bath for 15 min. Assays were terminated by the addition of 500 μl of 0.15 n HCl. Cyclic AMP in the acid extract (500 μl) was acetylated and quantified by automated radioimmunoassay (26Brooker G. Terasaki W.L. Price M.G. Science. 1979; 194: 270-276Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Monolayers of HEK-293 cells were loaded with 1 μm Fura-2/AM in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mmKH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3,0.5 mm CaCl2, 2.7 g/literd-glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.25% bovine serum albumin for 45 min. Cells were washed and resuspended in the same buffer without bovine serum albumin, plus 1 unit/ml adenosine deaminase. Fluorescence was monitored at an emission wavelength of 510 nm and excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm using an SLM spectrofluorimeter in a thermostable cuvette. Prior to stimulation, HEK-293 cells or canine BR cells were serum-starved for about 18 h. Assays were carried out on monolayers of HEK-293 cells in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium in a 37 °C, 5% CO2incubator or on suspended canine BR cells in complete Tyrode's buffer in a 37 °C shaking water bath. The reactions were terminated by placing the cells on ice and washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then lysed in Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 40 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysate was mixed and clarified by centrifugation (15 min, 14,000 rpm, 4 °C) in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The supernatant was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to nitrocellulose and immunoblotting. For co-transfection experiments, FLAG-tagged ERK2 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate (∼400 μg) using the anti-FLAG M2 gel according to the manufacturer's instruction (Kodak) before resolution by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 was detected by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution). The membranes were then stripped by incubating in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.7, at 65 °C) in a shaking water bath, and re-probed with mouse monoclonal anti-ERK2 antibody to quantify the total ERK2 loaded onto each lane. For quantification of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, films were scanned by a laser densitometry (Molecular Dynamics) and volume integration was performed using Image QuantTM software (Molecular Dynamics). Gs-coupled A2BARs are widely expressed in tissue culture lines. To detect A2BARs in cultured HEK-293 cells, we performed cAMP accumulation assays using the non-selective adenosine receptor agonist NECA. As shown in Fig. 1 A, NECA produces a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular levels of cyclic AMP with an EC50 of 2.7 ± 0.9 μm. Fig. 1 B shows that the response to NECA (1 μm) is substantially attenuated by the A2BAR-selective antagonist enprofylline (100 μm) as well as by the non-selective AR antagonist theophylline (100 μm), but not by the A1AR-selective antagonist, WRC0571. In binding assays both enprofylline and theophylline block recombinant human A2Bwith KI values of 7 μm (7Robeva A.S. Woodard R. Jin X. Gao Z. Bhattacharya S. Taylor H.E. Rosin D.L. Linden J. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 39: 243-252Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When added at 1 μm, CPA, IB-MECA, or CGS21680, agonists that are selective for A1, A3, A2A adenosine receptors, respectively, had little effect on intracellular cAMP in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1 B). Only at a very high concentration (100 μm) did the A2A-selective compound CGS21680 induce a small increase in intracellular cAMP (Fig.1 B). Also, we could not detect A1, A2A, or A3 receptors by subtype-selective radioligand binding to HEK-293 cell membranes (data not shown). These findings are consistent with the observation that mRNA transcripts for A2B, but not for A1, A2A, or A3 adenosine receptor subtype have been detected in HEK-293 cells by Northern analysis (27Townsend-Nicholson A. Challiss R.A.J. Receptor Signal Transduction Protocols. Human Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 45-54Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that the predominant endogenous adenosine receptors found on HEK-293 cells are A2BARs that are functionally coupled to Gsto stimulate adenylyl cyclase. We next sought to identify and characterize other signaling pathways mediated by A2BARs in HEK-293 cells. We found that NECA (1 μm) triggers transient intracellular Ca2+mobilization (Fig. 2 A), which is blocked by both enprofylline and theophylline but not by WRC0571, whereas 1 μm CPA, IB-MECA, or CGS21680 failed to provoke such a response (Fig. 2 B). Ca2+ mobilization also is elicited in response to UTP (via a P2Y2 receptor) or lysophosphatidic acid, as described in previous studies (2Schachter J.B. Sromek S.M. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Hooks S.B. Ragan S.P. Hopper D.W. Honemann C.W. Durieux M.E. MacDonald T.L. Lynch K.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Overnight pretreatment of HEK-293 cells with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin had no effect on the NECA- or UTP-induced increase of intracellular Ca2+ level (data not shown), but a 15-min pretreatment with 10 μm U73122, a specific phospholipase C inhibitor (29Jin W. Lo T.M. Loh H.H. Thayer S.A. Brain Res. 1994; 642: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), completely abolished both the NECA- and UTP-induced responses (Fig.2 C). The action of NECA to increase cyclic AMP and Ca2+ signaling cannot be attributed to acute cross-talk between these two signaling pathways since forskolin elevates cyclic AMP and not Ca2+, and UTP elevates Ca2+, but not cyclic AMP (data not shown). Based on these findings, we conclude that endogenous-A2B adenosine receptors in HEK-293 cells couple to cAMP accumulation via Gs, and to Ca2+mobilization via a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein, probably Gq/11. Many Gi-, Gq-, and some Gs-coupled receptors have been shown to elicit ERK activation in a variety of tissues and cultured cells, but little is known about the regulation of this pathway by adenosine receptors. We next set out to determine if endogenous A2BARs also couple to ERK activation in HEK-293 cells. HEK-293 cells were serum-starved overnight prior to stimulation with NECA, and ERK1/2 activation was then monitored by Western analysis using phospho-specific ERK antibodies, which only recognize activated and dually phosphorylated (Thr183 and Tyr185) ERK1/2. As shown in Fig.3, NECA evokes a time- and dose-dependent ERK1/2 activation. This activation is transient, peaks at 5 min, and gradually decreases to the baseline level in 15 min. The estimated EC50 for NECA-induced ERK1/2 activation is 0.7 μm. CPA, CGS21680, or IB-MECA (1 μm) are only weak activators of ERK1/2 compared with NECA (Fig. 4 A), and the response to NECA (0.5 μm) is blocked by enprofylline (100 μm) or theophylline (100 μm) (Fig.4 B). These data suggest that NECA-induced ERK1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells is mediated by the endogenous A2BAR.Figure 4NECA-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells is mediated by A2BARs. A, ERK1/2 activation in response to various AR agonists. Serum-starved HEK-293 cells were stimulated for 5 min with vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide), 1 μm NECA, or 1 μm AR subtype-selective agonists: CPA (A1AR), CGS21680 (A2AAR), or IB-MECA (A3AR) prior to the determination of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. B, inhibition of NECA-stimulated ERK1/2 activation by the AR antagonists enprofylline or theophylline. Serum-starved HEK-293 cells were treated with 0.5 μm NECA in the absence or presence of 100 μm enprofylline or 100 μm theophylline prior to the determination of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The data are normalized to the NECA-stimulated responses and each bar is the mean ± S.E. of pooled data from multiple experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the mechanism of A2BAR activation of ERK1/2, we first examined the effect of a highly specific inhibitor of MEK, PD098059 (30Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar). The ERK activation cascade is thought to proceed through Raf, which phosphorylates and activates MEK1/2. The MEKs phosphorylate ERK1/2 on both Thr and Tyr residues. PD098059 inhibits the activation of both MEK1 (IC50 = 5–10 μm) and MEK2 (IC50= 50 μm). As shown in Fig.5 A, ERK1/2 activation in response to 10 μm NECA stimulation was completely abolished by pretreatment for 20 min with 50 μm PD098059, suggesting that MEK1/2 are involved in A2BAR-mediated ERK1/2 activation. Next, we investigated the involvement of p21ras (Ras) in NECA-induced ERK1/2 activation. Both Ras-dependent and independent pathways have been reported for GPCR-mediated ERK activation (31Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged ERK2 together with either dominant-negative Ras-N17 or empty vector pcDNA3. Consistent with the well known involvement of Ras in receptor protein tyrosine kinase-mediated ERK activation, overexpression of Ras-N17 (confirmed by Western analysis using anti-Ras antibodies, Fig. 5 B, bottom blot) completely inhibited the ERK activation by EGF. Also inhibited were the NECA- and UTP-induced ERK activation. These data suggest that the signaling from the A2BAR or the P2Y2 receptor to ERK activation requires functional Ras in HEK-293 cells. Ras activation in response to EGF or ligands for G-protein coupled receptors such as the lysophosphatidic acid receptor in Rat-1 fibroblasts (32van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Moolenaar W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) generally requires tyrosine kinase activation, which, in most cases, can be blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. Although A2BAR and UTP receptor activation of ERK1/2 is Ras-dependent, neither response is affected by preincubation of cells with 100 μm genistein for 20 min, whereas under the same conditions, EGF-induced ERK1/2 activation was greatly reduced (Fig. 6). This suggests that NECA- and UTP-induced ERK1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells may utilize genistein-insensitive tyrosine kinases or be independent of tyrosine kinase activity. Since A2BARs are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase, we set out to determine if increased cAMP contributes to A2BAR-induced ERK1/2 activation. Depending on the cell type, cAMP can have either a stimulatory (via B-Raf) or an inhibitory (via c-Raf-1) impact on ERK activation (33Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Western analysis reveals the presence of both B-Raf and c-Raf-1 in HEK-293 cells (data not shown). Forskolin (10 μm) increased cyclic AMP and induced a transient ERK1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells with a time course similar to that produced by NECA (data not shown). However, the magnitude of ERK activation in response to forskolin (10 μm) was about 35% lower than the activation induced by NECA (Fig. 7). The increase in intracellular cAMP in response to a 5-min simulation with forskolin (10 μm) is about 2-fold higher than that induced by NECA (10 μm, data not shown). These data indicate that cAMP accumulation can contribute to but may not fully account for the NECA-stimulated ERK activation. On the other hand, we investigated the effect of the protein kinase A inhibitor, H-89, on NECA- and forskolin-stimulated ERK activation. In a series of experiments, pretreatment of cells with H-89 (10 μm, 30 min) abolished the forskolin-induced ERK1/2 activation, whereas it only slightly decreased NECA- or UTP-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 7). Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that cyclic AMP may have both stimulatory and inhibitory inputs on A2BAR-mediated ERK activation. Since A2BARs appear to couple to Gq/11 and activation of this pathway stimulates phospholipase C activity, we next set out to determine if phospholipase C is involved in NECA-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. As shown in Fig. 8, preincubation of HEK-293 cells with the specific phospholipase C inhibitor, U73122 (10 μm for 15 min), significantly attenuates (>50%) but does not eliminate NECA- and UTP-stimulated ERK1/2 activation, suggesting NECA- and UTP-induced ERK1/2 occurs at least in part via phospholipase C activation. To assess the involvement of PKC in NECA-induced ERK1/2 activation, HEK-293 cells were pretreated with the specific PKC inhibitors GF 109203X (2 μm, 15 min)(34) or Ro 31-8220 (10 μm, 15 min)(35). Whereas both inhibitors completely block phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced ERK1/2 activation, neither inhibited NECA-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 9). In fact, Ro 31-8220 somewhat enhanced NECA-mediated ERK1/2 activation. UTP or the calcium ionophore A23187 induced ERK1/2 activation and showed differential sensitivity to GF 109203X and Ro 31-8220. Whereas GF 109203X had no effect on UTP or A23187-mediated ERK1/2 activation, Ro 31-8220 inhibited both. We were particularly struck by the differential effect of Ro 31-8220 on NECA- and UTP-stimulated ERK activation. Since A2BARs signal through Gs and Gq/11, and P2Y2 receptors signal through Gq/11 only, we set out to determine if the differential effect of Ro 31-8220 is due to the elevated cAMP accompanied by Gs activation. We reasoned that through simultaneous application of both UTP and forskolin to the cell, it would be possible to mimic the cellular effect of A2BAR activation by NECA. Fig. 9 C shows that in fact the combination of forskolin and UTP does mimic the NECA response and is not inhibited by Ro 31-8220. In addition, ERK activation in response to forskolin alone is enhanced by Ro 31-8220 pretreatment. These data suggest that the lack of an apparent inhibitory effect of Ro 31-8220 on A2BAR-induced ERK1/2 activation may be due to the enhancement of cyclic AMP-mediated responses by Ro 31-8220. A2BARs have recently been shown to play an important role in regulating degranulation and cytokine release from canine and human mast cells (5Auchampach J.A. Jin J. Wan T.C. Caughey G.H. Linden J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 846-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We next determined if the A2BAR-mediated ERK1/2 activation that occurs in HEK-293 can also be observed in canine BR mast cells. As shown in Fig.10, NECA elicited ERK1/2 activation in canine BR mast cells. In contrast to the transient ERK1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells, the response in canine BR cells, peaked by 1 min (the earliest time point assayed), and was sustained for at least 60 min (Fig. 10 A). This response was also completely blocked by the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD098059 (50 μm, data not shown). Compared with NECA (1 μm), CPA, IB-MECA, or CGS21680 (1 μm) were relatively weak activators of ERK1/2 in canine BR mast cells (Fig. 10 B). Furthermore, the NECA (1 μm)-induced response was blocked by enprofylline (100 μm). These data suggest that the A2BAR is principally responsible for initiating the sustained ERK1/2 activation in canine BR mast cells. The activation of purinergic receptors produce various acute G protein-mediated responses, e.g. changes in muscle tone, neuronal firing, immune function, and secretion of various hormones and cytokines. Recent studies also suggest that purines may trigger more slowly acting signal transduction cascades to mediate changes in cellular proliferation (36Sexl V. Mancusi G. Baumgartner-Parzer S.

In the present study we show that stimulation of endogenous A2BARs in HEK-293 cells evokes three responses: cyclic AMP accumulation, Ca2+ mobilization, and activation of ERK1/2. This newly characterized A2BAR-mediated ERK1/2 activation and a P2Y2 receptor-mediated response elicited by UTP are dependent on Ras and MEK1/2. Both responses are attenuated by U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, are completely insensitive to genistein, an inhibitor of certain tyrosine k"

We compared the mode of phagocytosis using spermatogenic cells at different stages of spermatogenesis. Spermatogenic cells were separated into several groups based on their ploidy, with purities of 60–90%. When the fractionated spermatogenic cell populations were subjected to a phagocytosis assay, cells with ploidies of 1n, 2n, and 4n were almost equally phagocytosed by Sertoli cells. All the cell populations exposed PS on the cell surface, and phagocytosis of all cell populations was similarly inhibited by the addition of PS-containing liposomes. Class B scavenger receptor type I (SR-BI), a candidate for the PS receptor, was detected in Sertoli cells. Overexpression of the rat SR-BI cDNA increased the PS-mediated phagocytic activity of Sertoli cell-derived cell lines. Moreover, phagocytosis of spermatogenic cells by Sertoli cells was inhibited in the presence of an anti-SR-BI antibody. Finally, the addition of high density lipoprotein, a ligand specific for SR-BI, decreased both phagocytosis of spermatogenic cells and incorporation of PS-containing liposomes by Sertoli cells. In conclusion, SR-BI functions at least partly as a PS receptor, enabling Sertoli cells to recognize and phagocytose apoptotic spermatogenic cells at all stages of differentiation.

However, the molecular basis underlying the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells remains to be clarified. Apoptosis and subsequent phagocytosis also occur in areas where macrophages do not infiltrate, such as the brain and the testis. In the testis, more than half of the differentiating spermatogenic cells die, probably by apoptosis, before they mature into spermatozoa (reviewed in Refs. 4Huckins C. Anat.

Only a limited number of apoptotic spermatogenic cells, however, are detectable when testis sections are histochemically examined. This may be due to the elimination of degenerating spermatogenic cells by testicular phagocytes at the early stage of apoptosis. Electron microscopic studies with rodent testis sections have shown that degenerating spermatogenic cells are engulfed by Sertoli cells, a type of testicular somatic cell (14Chemes H.

We previously reported that primary cultured rat spermatogenic cells of 20-day-old rats, which mostly consisted of spermatocytes, underwent apoptosis and were phagocytosed by Sertoli cells (22Mizuno K. Shiratsuchi A. Masamune Y. Nakanishi Y. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 119-123PubMed Google Scholar). In the apoptotic spermatogenic cells, phosphatidylserine (PS),1 which is otherwise confined to the inner leaflet of the membrane bilayer, was translocated to the outer leaflet, and phagocytosis was inhibited in the presence of liposomes containing PS (23Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2354-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether spermatogenic cells at various stages of differentiation are phagocytosed by Sertoli cells in a manner similar to spermatocyte phagocytosis and tried to identify the PS receptor presumed to be present on the surface of Sertoli cells and to be responsible for recognition and subsequent phagocytosis of apoptotic spermatogenic cells. Dispersed testicular cells were prepared from testes dissected from either 20- or 45-day-old Donryu rats as described previously (24Nagao Y. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 1088-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Tamaru M. Nagao Y. Taira M. Tatibana M. Masamune Y. Nakanishi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The dispersed spermatogenic cells were separated through a 2–4% (v/v) density gradient formed on a 20% cushion of Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) using a Celsep apparatus (Brinkmann Instruments) (26Wolgemuth D.J. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Engelmyer E. Gavin B.J. Ponzetto C. Gamete Res. 1985; 12: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. From six 20-day-old rats, 2–3 × 106 4n-rich cells and 6–10 × 105 2n-rich cells were obtained; and from 45-day-old rats, 1–2 × 107 1n-rich cells (first elution), 6–10 × 105 2n-rich cells, and 6–10 × 105 1n-rich cells (second elution) were obtained. Sertoli cells were isolated as described (23Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2354-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Phagocytosis of spermatogenic cells by Sertoli cells was performed as described previously (23Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2354-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. In brief, spermatogenic cells that had been cultured without Sertoli cells for 14–15 h were labeled with biotin (NHS-LS-Biotin, Pierce) and added to Sertoli cell cultures maintained either in 96-well plates (Corning, Cambridge, MA) for phagocytosis of fractionated spermatogenic cells or in Lab-Tek Chamber Slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) for phagocytosis of unfractionated spermatogenic cells of 20-day-old rats at a ratio of 10:1 spermatogenic cells/Sertoli cells. The culture was kept at 32.5 °C for 2 h, and unreacted spermatogenic cells were removed first by pipetting with phosphate-buffered saline and then by trypsin (0.5 mg/ml) treatment for 3 min at room temperature. The remaining cells were fixed, supplemented with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled avidin (fluorescein-avidin D, Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA), and examined under a fluorescence/phase-contrast microscope (IX70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The ratio of the number of Sertoli cells having fluorescent signals to total Sertoli cells was determined in each microscopic field. Six to eight fields from different culture wells were examined in each experiment, and the results were analyzed statistically. The means ± S.D. of a typical example from at least two independent experiments were taken as the phagocytic index. Since Sertoli cell-derived cell lines only weakly attached to the culture container, the phagocytosis assay with these cells was slightly modified. The phagocytic cells and cultured spermatogenic cells were mixed and maintained at 32.5 °C for 2–3 h, and the cells were all detached from the culture container by treatment with 0.1% (w/v) trypsin and 0.02% (w/v) EDTA, placed on poly-d-lysine-coated glass slides, and further treated as described above. Cell-surface PS was detected using FITC-conjugated annexin V (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria) as described previously (27Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Green D.R. Cotter T.G. Martin S.J. Techniques in Apoptosis : A User's Guide. Portland Press Ltd., London1996: 107-119Google Scholar). Spermatogenic cells were simultaneously treated with propidium iodide and FITC-conjugated annexin V and analyzed with a flow cytometer (EPICS XL, Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). The cells negative for propidium iodide staining, which were considered to retain integrity of the plasma membrane, were gated and analyzed for binding of the FITC-labeled probe. Liposomes were prepared as described previously (28Nishikawa K. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5226-5231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PS-containing liposomes were composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and PS at a molar ratio of 7:3. Fluorescence-labeled liposomes were prepared with N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti Polar Lipids) at 1% of total phospholipids. Human HDL was prepared in the density range 1.063–1.21 g/ml from plasma by ultracentrifugation according to standard procedures (29Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared using acid guanidinium thiocyanate (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar), and poly(A)-containing RNA was enriched by affinity chromatography (oligo(dT)-cellulose type 2, Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). The RNA was separated on a formaldehyde-containing 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The membrane was probed with a DNA fragment derived from the human β-actin pseudogene (31Ueyama H. Hamada H. Battula N. Kakunaga T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or a cDNA of the hamster class B scavenger receptor type I (SR-BI) (32Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hybridization signals were visualized by autoradiography using x-ray film (X-AR, Eastman Kodak Co.). Electrophoresis, transfer, blotting, and hybridization were conducted according to standard procedures (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The probes were labeled with 32P by random priming (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using a commercial kit (Takara Shuzo, Otsu, Shiga, Japan). Poly(A)-containing RNA (∼6 μg) was prepared from Sertoli cells (1.8 × 108) of 20-day-old rats and used to make a cDNA library using a commercial kit (Great Lengths cDNA synthesis kit,CLONTECH). The cDNA was ligated with the λZAPII vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and packaged using GigapackIII Gold (Stratagene). The library, containing 1 × 105 independent clones, was screened by hybridization with a probe of the hamster SR-BI cDNA. Final positive clones were sequenced using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI Prism 377, Perkin-Elmer). Rat SR-BI cDNA was recloned into the pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen, NV Leek, The Netherlands) and introduced into Sertoli cell-derived cultured cell lines 15P-1 (a gift from F. Cuzin) (19Rassoulzadegan M. Paquis-Flucklinger V. Bertino B. Sage J. Jasin M. Miyagawa K. van Heyningen V. Besmer P. Cuzin F. Cell. 1993; 75: 997-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and TM4 (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MA) (34Mather J.P. Zhuang L.-Z. Perez-Infante V. Phillips D.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 383: 44-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) by the calcium phosphate method using a commercial kit (Invitrogen), and the cells were selected by maintenance in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and G418 (0.5 mg/ml) (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 32.5 °C for 7–14 days. The selected cells were cloned and used for further analyses. Fluorescence-labeled liposomes were added to cultured cells at 0.2 mm, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 32.5 °C. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the extent of liposome incorporation was determined using either a flow cytometer or a fluorescence/phase-contrast microscope. Sertoli cell-derived cell lines were mixed with fluorescence-labeled latex beads (Polybead Microparticles (ø = 0.75 μm), Polysciences, Warrington, PA) for 1 h at 37 °C, and incorporation of the beads was examined using either flow cytometry or microscopy. Peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 76–95 and 110–132 of hamster SR-BI (32Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with an extra Cys residue at the carboxyl terminus were synthesized. The peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, emulsified with Freund's adjuvant, and injected into the backs of New Zealand White rabbits. Anti-SR-BI antibodies were affinity-purified from the rabbit sera as described previously (35Kikuchi H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kanegasaki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Anti-SR-BI-76 and anti-SR-BI-110 stand for antibodies raised against peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 76–95 and 110–132, respectively. Anti-SR-BI-76 was used throughout the study, except that immunohistochemical analysis was done with anti-SR-BI-110. Membrane fractions were prepared from liver and primary cultured Sertoli cells and spermatogenic cells of 20-day-old rats as described previously (36Jokinen E.V. Landschulz K.T. Wyne K.L. Ho Y.K. Frykman P.K. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26411-26418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions were denatured under reducing conditions and separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and the membrane was blocked with 5% dry skim milk. The membrane was incubated with an anti-SR-BI antibody in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15 mNaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20; washed; reacted with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Bio-Rad); and subjected to a chemiluminescence reaction using the Immun-Star system (Bio-Rad). Cultured cell lines or Sertoli cells of 20-day-old rats were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The fixed cells were then mixed with an anti-SR-BI antibody and left at room temperature for 1 h. To detect the transcription factor Ad4-binding protein (Ad4BP) (37Morohashi K. Zanger U.M. Honda S. Hara M. Waterman M.R. Omura T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1196-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), the fixed Sertoli cells were further treated with 0.1% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline, then with methanol for permeabilization of the plasma membrane, and finally with an anti-Ad4BP antibody (37Morohashi K. Zanger U.M. Honda S. Hara M. Waterman M.R. Omura T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1196-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were supplemented with an FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Immunotech, Marseilles, France) for 30 min at room temperature and examined under a fluorescence/phase-contrast microscope. The cells present in seminiferous tubules of either 20- or 45-day-old rats were dispersed by successive treatment with trypsin and collagenase and subjected to a Percoll density gradient. The morphology of the separated cells was examined by microscopy, and cells with similar morphology were combined. When the combined cells were subjected to DNA flow cytometry, cell populations with distinct ploidy were found at 60–90% purity (Fig.1 A). The cells were eluted from the gradient in the order of 4n-, 1n-, 2n-, and 1n-rich populations; 1n-rich cells were recovered in two different populations. 2n- and 4n-rich cell populations were obtained from 20-day-old rats, and 1n- and 2n-rich cell populations from 45-day-old rats. The separated cell populations were distinctive in appearance, and morphological examination allowed us to identify particular spermatogenic cell types, i.e. 1n-rich cells (first elution) consisted of round spermatids, 1n-rich cells (second elution) contained many elongated spermatids, most 2n-rich cells were spermatogonia, and 4n-rich cells were spermatocytes (Fig. 1 B). Testicular somatic cells, including Sertoli cells, were not recovered as a major population in any fraction, and they probably remained attached to the chamber wall of the separation apparatus. We first determined how efficiently the fractionated spermatogenic cells were phagocytosed by Sertoli cells. The cells were cultured without Sertoli cells for 14–15 h to remove residual contamination of somatic cells that adhered to the culture container. The cultured spermatogenic cells, the viability of which was 80–90% as determined by trypan blue exclusion, were subjected to a phagocytosis assay with isolated rat Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells prepared from 20-day-old rats phagocytosed 2n- and 4n-rich cells of 20-day-old rats as efficiently as they did unfractionated spermatogenic cells (Fig.2 A). Similarly, 1n- and 2n-rich cells prepared from 45-day-old rats were almost equally phagocytosed by Sertoli cells from 20-day-old rats (Fig.2 B). These results showed that spermatogenic cells at various stages of differentiation were phagocytosed by Sertoli cells with similar efficiencies. We previously showed that PS was translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer of unfractionated spermatogenic cells of 20-day-old rats during culture without Sertoli cells and that liposomes containing PS inhibited phagocytosis of the spermatogenic cells by Sertoli cells (23Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2354-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether PS externalization occurs in fractionated spermatogenic cells. Translocation of PS to the surface of the spermatogenic cells was determined using flow cytometry with FITC-labeled annexin V, which specifically binds to PS (38Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Kuijten G.A.M. Keehnen R.M.J. Pals S.T. van Oers M.H.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All spermatogenic cell populations examined showed the presence of annexin V-bound cells, although the content differed among the populations (Fig.3 A), indicating that PS externalization occurs in apoptotic spermatogenic cells at all stages of differentiation. We then examined the effect of PS-containing liposomes on phagocytosis of fractionated spermatogenic cells by Sertoli cells. As shown in Fig.3 B, the addition of PS-containing liposomes significantly reduced phagocytosis of 1n- and 2n-rich cells of 45-day-old rats as well as of 4n-rich cells of 20-day-old rats, whereas liposomes composed of PC alone had little effect. The inhibition by PS-containing liposomes of phagocytosis of 2n-rich cells from 20-day-old rats was not significant, but a decrease in the phagocytic index in the presence of the liposomes was reproducibly observed. These results indicated the involvement of PS in the phagocytosis of all apoptotic spermatogenic cells by Sertoli cells. The above results suggested the presence of a molecule(s) that recognizes PS and induces phagocytosis on the surface of Sertoli cells. SR-BI (reviewed in Ref.39Rigotti A. Trigatti B. Babitt J. Penman M. Xu S. Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) is a strong candidate for such a PS receptor since it recognizes PS (40Rigotti A.

Tall A.R. Huszar D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4619-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We first examined whether Sertoli cells contain SR-BI mRNA. Oligo(dT)-selected RNA from Sertoli cells and spermatogenic cells of 20-day-old rats was blot-hybridized with a hamster SR-BI cDNA probe. The RNA from both cell types showed a discrete signal whose size roughly corresponded to that of the rat ovary SR-BI mRNA (45Mizutani T. Sonoda Y. Minegishi T. Wakabayashi K. Miyamoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig.4). This indicated that rat Sertoli cells express a gene coding for SR-BI. We then isolated an SR-BI cDNA by screening a library prepared from Sertoli cell mRNA using the hamster SR-BI cDNA as a hybridization probe. Three positive clones were obtained, and sequence analyses of two clones revealed one to be a part of the other. The longer clone included the entire coding region, and the primary sequence of rat Sertoli SR-BI 2The nucleotide sequence for the rat Sertoli cell SR-BI cDNA has been deposited in the DDBJ/GenBankTM/EMBL nucleotide sequence data bases with accession number AB002151. was found to be identical to that of rat ovary SR-BI (45Mizutani T. Sonoda Y. Minegishi T. Wakabayashi K. Miyamoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine the function of Sertoli cell SR-BI, the cDNA was introduced into Sertoli cell-derived cultured cell lines 15P-1 and TM4. From the cells that remained alive in G418-containing medium, 14 clones of 15P-1 and 30 clones of TM4 cells were isolated. They were first examined for the ability to incorporate fluorescence-labeled PS-containing liposomes by flow cytometry. The five 15P-1 clones and the 10 TM4 clones tested incorporated PS-containing liposomes more efficiently than the corresponding parental cells (Fig.5 A). The SR-BI mRNA was detectable in both parental cell lines (Fig. 5 B). When parental cells and transfectants were immunohistochemically examined for the presence of SR-BI with anti-SR-BI-110, extranuclear localization of the protein was observed in all of them, and all the transfectants examined were found to contain more SR-BI than the corresponding parental cells (Fig. 5 C). These cell clones were then subjected to a phagocytosis assay with apoptotic spermatogenic cells. Both parental cell lines possessed activity for phagocytosing spermatogenic cells in a PS-dependent manner (Fig. 5 D). When the selected transfectants were tested, all showed higher activity levels of PS-mediated phagocytosis than the parental cells; the extent of the increase in the activity caused by SR-BI expression was not large, but was significant (Fig.5 D). The levels of activity of engulfing latex beads were comparable among parental cells and transfectants (data not shown). The above results indicated that overexpression of SR-BI confers the PS-mediated phagocytic activity of apoptotic spermatogenic cells on Sertoli cell-derived cell lines. We next studied whether SR-BI is actually involved in spermatogenic cell phagocytosis by Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells were first examined for the presence of SR-BI protein. Membrane fractions prepared from primary cultured Sertoli cells and spermatogenic cells of 20-day-old rats were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-SR-BI-76 (Fig.6 A). A discrete signal with a molecular mass of ∼70 kDa was detected in Sertoli cell proteins, and it disappeared in the presence of the antigen peptide, but not a peptide corresponding to another region of SR-BI. Moreover, the migration of the signal was almost the same as that of a signal detectable with rat liver proteins. SR-BI protein seemed much less abundant in spermatogenic cells than in Sertoli cells. When Sertoli cells were immunohistochemically examined with anti-SR-BI-110, many of the cells showed extranuclear signals, but at differing intensities (Fig. 6 B). On the other hand, the nuclei of Sertoli cells appeared to be uniformly stained with an antibody specific to the transcription factor Ad4BP, which exists in Sertoli and Leydig cells of the testis (37Morohashi K. Zanger U.M. Honda S. Hara M. Waterman M.R. Omura T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1196-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Treatment with control normal rabbit IgG did not produce signals (data not shown). These results indicated that SR-BI exists in rat Sertoli cells. The antibodies used here do not distinguish SR-BII (46Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) from SR-BI. Most of the signal was, however, likely to be derived from SR-BI since SR-BII is much less abundant than SR-BI in the testis (46Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We then determined the effect of anti-SR-BI antibodies on phagocytosis of spermatogenic cells by Sertoli cells prepared from 20-day-old rats. The addition of anti-SR-BI-76 inhibited the phagocytosis reaction, whereas control normal rabbit IgG had a minimal effect (Fig. 6 C). Anti-SR-BI-110 showed a similar inhibitory effect (data not shown). Significant levels of the phagocytic activity always remained in the presence of maximal amounts of the antibody, and the residual activity was reduced by the addition of PS-containing liposomes (Fig. 6 D), indicating that some part of PS-mediated phagocytosis by Sertoli cells is resistant to anti-SR-BI antibodies. We next examined the effect of HDL, a specific ligand for SR-BI (39Rigotti A. Trigatti B. Babitt J. Penman M. Xu S. Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). HDL inhibited both phagocytosis of spermatogenic cells (Fig. 7 A) and incorporation of PS-containing liposomes (Fig. 7 B) by Sertoli cells of 20-day-old rats in a dose-dependent manner. All of the above results indicated that SR-BI acts as a phagocytosis-inducing PS receptor of Sertoli cells, but that a small portion of PS-mediated phagocytosis seems to be executed by a molecule(s) other than SR-BI.Figure 7Effect of HDL on phagocytosis and liposome incorporation by Sertoli cells. A, effect of HDL on phagocytic activity of Sertoli cells. The phagocytosis reaction of apoptotic spermatogenic cells by Sertoli cells of 20-day-old rats was conducted in the presence of the indicated concentrations of HDL, and the extent of the reaction is shown relative to that in a control reaction with no added HDL, taken as 100. Vertical barsindicate the standard error. B, effect of HDL on incorporation of PS-containing liposomes by Sertoli cells. Incorporation of fluorescence-labeled PS-containing liposomes by Sertoli cells of 20-day-old rats was examined in the presence of HDL or unlabeled PS-containing liposomes (PS) (1 mm).Left panel, fluorescence microscopic views of liposome-incorporating Sertoli cells are shown. HDL was added at 800 μg/ml. Scale bar = 10 μm. Right panel, the level of the fluorescence signal was determined using a cooled charge coupled device camera and is shown relative to a control reaction, taken as 100.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As has been suggested from histochemical examination, apoptotic spermatogenic cells at all stages of differentiation were phagocytosed by Sertoli cells in vitro. This indicated that Sertoli cells are capable of phagocytosing all types of spermatogenic cells undergoing apoptosis during spermatogenesis. Moreover, the present results showed that all the apoptotic spermatogenic cells examined were recognized by Sertoli cells via PS exposed on the surface of the dying cells. This suggests that the apoptotic pathway and mode of subsequent recognition by Sertoli cells are common to all degenerating spermatogenic cells regardless of their state of differentiation. Membrane phospholipids of normal cells are localized asymmetrically on the membrane bilayer, i.e. PC and sphingomyelin are mostly present in the outer leaflet, whereas other phospholipids, including PS and phosphatidylethanolamine, are restricted to the inner leaflet (reviewed in Refs. 47Zachowski A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar and 48Zwaal R.F.A. Schroit A.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If such asymmetry is lost upon induction of apoptosis, phospholipids that normally exist on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane would appear on the cell surface, serving as a marker of apoptotic cells (49Verhoven B.

We showed here that PS externalization occurs in apoptotic spermatogenic cells at all stages of differentiation. It is thus possible that a loss of membrane phospholipid asymmetry, at least with regard to PS, is a general feature of apoptotic cells. It is still unclear how phagocytes discriminate between apoptotic and normal cells. Several approaches have been taken to resolve this issue, and it is presumed that certain molecules present on the surface of phagocytic cells are responsible for the recognition of apoptotic cells (reviewed in Refs. 3Ren Y. Savill J. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 58Savill J. Fadok V. Henson P. Haslettm C. Immunol.

The externalization of PS is one of the earliest changes in apoptosing cells (reviewed in Refs. 48Zwaal R.F.A. Schroit A.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholarand 60Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Frasch S.C. Warner M.L. Henson P.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), and a role for externalized PS in the recognition of apoptotic cells by phagocytes has been demonstrated (reviewed in Refs. 3Ren Y. Savill J. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 48Zwaal R.F.A. Schroit A.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 58Savill J. Fadok V.

Bull. 1997; 53: 491-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The presence of a phagocyte receptor(s) that recognizes PS exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells has thus been postulated, and several molecules have been identified as candidates (Ref. 61Oka K. Sawamura T. Kikuta K.-I. Itokawa S. Kume N. Kita T. Masaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9535-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 60Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Frasch S.C. Warner M.L. Henson P.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar); among them are class B scavenger receptors. We have provided evidence here that SR-BI, a member of the class B scavenger receptor family, is a Sertoli cell PS receptor responsible for phagocytosis of apoptotic spermatogenic cells. SR-BI has been shown to function as the PS-recognizing phagocytosis receptor in some cultured cell lines such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (41Fukasawa M. Adachi H. Hirota K. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and a human monocyte-derived cell line, THP-1 (62Murao K. Terpstra V. Green S.R. Kondratenko N. Steinberg D. Quehenberger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17551-17557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that this particular member of the scavenger receptor family is the phagocytosis-inducing PS receptor common to the non-macrophage-type phagocytic cells. Since antibody inhibition of phagocytic activity of Sertoli cells was only partial and the residual activity was inhibitable by PS-containing liposomes, the presence of another phagocytosis-inducing PS receptor is presumed. We previously showed that integrin is not involved in the phagocytosis reaction by Sertoli cells (23Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2354-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Lectins are not likely to participate in the recognition between Sertoli cells and spermatogenic cells either since the addition of GlcNAc, GlcN, GalN, or Glc at 20 mm did not affect the phagocytosis reaction (data not shown). Other approaches should be taken to identify this additional phagocytosis receptor of Sertoli cells. The level of SR-BI expression did not appear to be uniform among Sertoli cells of 20-day-old rats. This suggests that their phagocytic activity varies at different spermatogenic stages. We thank M. Hoshi and M. Matsumoto for allowing us to use the Celsep apparatus; F. Cuzin for the 15P-1 cells; K. Morohashi for the anti-Ad4BP antibody; and T. Haneji and T. Hirose for help in identifying spermatogenic cell types and Western blotting, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2064681322,"Breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and BRCA1-associated RING domain 1 (BARD1) are multidomain proteins that interact in vivo via their N-terminal RING finger motif regions. To characterize functional aspects of the BRCA1/BARD1 interaction, we have defined the structural domains required for the interaction, as well as their oligomerization state, relative stability, and possible nucleic acid binding activity. We have found that the RING finger motifs do not themselves constitute stable structural domains but are instead part of larger domains comprising residues 1–109 of BRCA1 and residues 26–119 of BARD1. These domains exist as homodimers and preferentially form a stable heterodimer. Shorter BRCA1 RING finger constructs do not interact with BARD1 or with longer BRCA1 constructs, indicating that the heterodimeric and homodimer interactions are mediated by regions outside the canonical RING finger motif. Nucleic acid binding is a generally proposed function of RING finger domains. We show that neither the homodimers nor the heterodimer displays affinity for nucleic acids, indicating that the proposed roles of BRCA1 and BARD1 in DNA repair and/or transcriptional activation must be mediated either by other regions of the proteins or by additional cofactors.

In large multifunctional proteins, such as BRCA1, different functions are often dispersed among discrete structural regions or domains. In such cases, functional studies can be facilitated by characterization of the properties of individual domains or subunits. Unfortunately, in the case of BRCA1, a large protein of 1863 amino acids, clues regarding the location or extent of independent functional domains are not readily available on the basis of sequence homologies. A noteworthy exception is the RING1 finger consensus motif located at the N-terminal end of the protein (1Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuch-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Science. 1994; 266: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (5330) Google Scholar). The RING finger is a zinc-binding motif defined by a conserved pattern of cysteine and histidine residues that is found in a wide variety of proteins of diverse origin and function (2Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Although more than 80 RING finger-containing proteins have been identified to date, a specific cellular function has not yet been associated with the motif (3Saurin A.J. Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the importance of the RING finger to BRCA1 function is supported by the following observations: 1) the first 100 residues, including the RING finger motif (residues 24–64), are the most highly conserved regions among known BRCA1 genes (4Sharan S.K. Wims M. Bradley A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2275-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Abel K.J. Xu J. Yin G.-Y. Lyons R.H. Meisler M.H. Weber B.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2265-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); 2) several cancer-predisposing mutations have been identified within this region of BRCA1 (6Castilla L.H. Couch F.J. Erdos M.R. Hoskins K.F. Calzone K. Garber J.E. Boyd J. Lubin M.B. Deshano M.L. Brody L.C. Collins F.S. Weber B.L. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 7Friedman L.S.

Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 9Jensen D.E. Proctor M. Marquis S.T.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). One of the proteins found to associate with the BRCA1 N-terminal region, BARD1 (8Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), also contains an N-terminal RING finger motif (residues 50–86). Yeast two-hybrid studies showed that the N-terminal RING finger regions of both BRCA1 and BARD1 are required for specific heterocomplex formation between the proteins. Subsequent cellular localization studies demonstrated that BRCA1 and BARD1 localize to discrete nuclear foci (dots) during S phase and disperse during other phases of the cell cycle (10Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). In addition, complexes containing BRCA1 and BARD1 have been detected on damaged, replicating DNA structures (10Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that a multiprotein complex involving BRCA1 is responsive both to the cell cycle and to DNA damage and identify an important cellular interaction among the proteins. Despite identification of heterologous protein interactions, the cellular basis of BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression remains elusive. When initially identified, it was suggested that the BRCA1 RING finger may play a role in specific DNA binding (1Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuch-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Science. 1994; 266: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (5330) Google Scholar). Indeed, there has been considerable speculation regarding a general function for RING finger proteins in nucleic-acid interactions. To date, published data on the DNA binding properties of RING fingers are conflicting and equivocal: there are reports that particular RING finger proteins or domains bind synthetic oligonucleotides or DNA cellulose, whereas other reports provide evidence to the contrary (11Barlow P.N. Luisi B. Milner A. Elliot M. Everett R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 12Everett R.D. Barlow P. Milner A. Luisi B. Orr A. Hope G. Lyon D. J. Mol.

Taniguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20021-20026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In no case, however, has specific nucleic acid binding been demonstrated. Nonetheless, BRCA1 has been reported associated with certain chromatin structures in vivo and linked to the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex (15Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar,16Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that BRCA1 might associate directly with nucleic acids either alone or upon formation of a complex with BARD1. In order to characterize the functional significance of the BRCA1/BARD1 interaction further, we have sought to define the extent of the structural region encompassing the RING finger consensus motifs for both proteins. We find that the RING finger motifs do not themselves constitute stable structural units but are instead part of larger structural domains. Interactions and properties that may contribute to the function of these proteins, including their oligomerization states, relative stabilities, and nucleic acid binding activities are described herein. 3,5-Dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid) and 2,2′:6′,2“terpyridine were obtained from Aldrich and used without further purification. Limited proteolysis studies used sequencing grade endoproteinase Lys-C (Pierce) and V8 endo proteinase (Worthington). Bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, α-chymotrypsinogen, and ribonuclease A, and glutaraldehyde were purchased from Sigma. BC-76, BC-112, and BC-172 constructs were prepared as described previously (17Brzovic P.S. Meza J. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7795-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). BARD1 constructs were prepared in a similar fashion using primers to obtain the desired BARD1 polymerase chain reaction products from human lymphoblast cDNA. The primers were synthesized with NheI and BamHI endonuclease restriction sites in the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction products and pET11a vector (Novagen) were then digested with NheI and BamHI, ligated, and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells, and clones were sequenced as described previously for BRCA1 constructs (17Brzovic P.S. Meza J. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7795-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because of the restriction sites used, each construct contains two extra amino acids (Ala and Ser) at the N terminus. BC-112 also contains two additional residues at its C terminus (Gly and Lys) as a result of the cloning procedure. Construct and fragment designations refer to the number and position of BRCA1 or BARD1 residues. BRCA1 constructs were expressed and purified as described previously (17Brzovic P.S. Meza J. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7795-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Purification of BARD1 constructs was identical to that of BRCA1 constructs with one minor modification. The BARD1-containing insoluble fraction was re-solubilized into 6m guanidine-HCl as before (17Brzovic P.S. Meza J. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7795-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), diluted to 2 mguanidine-HCl by dropwise addition of Tris buffer (50 mmTris, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.6) and purified to homogeneity by reverse phase chromatography. Protein purity and concentration was determined as described previously for the BRCA1 constructs (17Brzovic P.S. Meza J. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7795-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Approximate extinction coefficients at 280 nm for BARD1 constructs, calculated on the basis of amino acid composition, are 19.55, 13.86, and 13.86 mm−1cm−1 for BD 26–152, BD 26–140, and BD 26–131, respectively. Fluorescence spectra were measured on a Spex Fluorolog 2 fluorometer using a 1 × 0.5-cm cuvette at 25 °C. BARD1 homodimer and BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer sample (1.0 ml) concentrations were adjusted to 1 μm BARD1 monomer in 25 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl buffer at pH 7.6. Spectra were collected using an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and scanning the emission spectrum between 300 and 450 nm. Gel-filtration chromatography, glutaraldehyde cross-linking, limited proteolysis, and MALDI-TOF spectroscopy experiments were performed as described previously (17Brzovic P.S. Meza J. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7795-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). BRCA1, BARD1, and the ADR1 zinc finger domain constructs were purified by gel-filtration chromatography in 25 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.6 (Buffer 1). Peak fractions (approximately 10 μm by absorbance) were loaded onto double- and single-stranded DNA cellulose (calf thymus DNA, Sigma) and synthetic RNA (poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), and poly(U)) agarose (Sigma) columns at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min in Buffer 1. Columns were washed with 5 column volumes of Buffer 1 to remove nonspecifically bound material. The bound material was eluted with a 50–350 mm NaCl gradient (5 column volumes), followed by a 350–600 mm NaCl gradient (2 column volumes), and a final wash with 2 m NaCl to remove tightly bound protein. Each column (Perseptive Biosystems) was packed with approximately 1 ml of nucleic acid resin. The identity of eluted material was verified by analysis of peak fractions on 14% SDS-PAGE. Three different sized BRCA1 RING finger constructs (termed BC-76, BC-112, and BC-172; TableI) were tested for their ability to interact with a BARD1 RING finger construct. The BARD1 construct (BD 26–152) encompasses residues 26–152 and was chosen on the basis of reported two-hybrid studies (8Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). 2BARD1 contains two potential initiator methionines (residues Met1 and Met26). The yeast two-hybrid studies showed that the first 25 residues of BARD1 are not required for the BRCA1/BARD1 interaction. We used gel-filtration chromatography to assess the oligomeric states of the constructs. Fig.1 A illustrates gel-filtration elution profiles for BC-172, BD 26–152, and a 1:1 mixture of the two constructs. Individually, each construct elutes primarily as a single peak at an elution volume that corresponds to a molecular weight roughly twice the expected value, suggesting that both BC-172 and BD 26–152 homodimerize in solution. An equimolar mixture of the two constructs elutes as a single sharp peak with a width comparable to those of standard proteins used for column calibration. The intermediate elution volume relative to the two individual species is indicative of a heterodimeric complex between BC-172 and BD 26–152. Similar results were obtained with BC-112 and BD 26–152 (data not shown).Table IDescription of BRCA1 and BARD1 N-terminal constructsConstruct nameProtein residuesCalculated monomer molecular massMALDI-TOF massaReported masses are average masses derived from three different measurements.DaBC-76BRCA: 1–768,8398,840 ± 2BC-112BRCA1: 1–110bBC-112 contains two additional non-BRCA1 residues at its C terminus (see under “Experimental Procedures”).12,96012,961 ± 2BC-172BRCA1: 1–17219,87719,884 ± 8BD 26–131BARD1: 26–13112,13312,129 ± 3BD 26–140BARD1: 26–14013,12113,126 ± 4BD 26–152BARD1: 26–15214,58414,589 ± 5Residues encompassed by each construct, corresponding calculated molecular masses, and masses determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry are shown.a Reported masses are average masses derived from three different measurements.b BC-112 contains two additional non-BRCA1 residues at its C terminus (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Open table in a new tab Residues encompassed by each construct, corresponding calculated molecular masses, and masses determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry are shown. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking of peak fractions collected from gel-filtration columns, followed by SDS-PAGE, confirmed the oligomerization state of each species. Fig. 1 B shows results of cross-linking experiments performed on the BC-172, BC-172/BD 26–152, and BD 26–152 peak fractions. Each cross-linking reaction produced a new band not present in the starting material (Fig.1 B, compare lanes 1, 3, and 5 withlanes 2, 4, and 6, respectively). The cross-linked bands in lanes 1 and 5 run at molecular masses that correspond to the homodimeric form of BC-172 and BD 26–152 (∼40 kDa and ∼29 kDa, respectively), whereas the cross-linked band in lane 3 exhibits an intermediate molecular mass, which corresponds to that of the BC-172/BD 26–152 heterodimer (∼34.5 kDa). Similar to the results from the gel-filtration analysis, the cross-linking experiments demonstrate that the heterodimer is formed preferentially relative to the homodimeric species in solution. Again, similar cross-linking results were obtained with BC-112 and BD 26–152 (data not shown). BD 26–152 contains three tryptophans, whereas BC-112 contains no tryptophans (see Fig. 6 for sequences), allowing the use of fluorescence to distinguish the BD 26–152 homodimer from the BC-112/BD 26–152 heterodimer. The fluorescence spectrum of the BD 26–152 homodimer exhibits an emission maximum at 347 nm (λex = 290 nm). The emission maximum of an equimolar mixture of BC-112 and BD 26–152 is blue-shifted to 335 nm with a corresponding increase in intensity (Fig. 2). Under the conditions used in the fluorescence experiments, BD 26–152 is a homodimer. Therefore, the shift and increase in emission intensity indicate that at least one tryptophan in BD 26–152 experiences a more hydrophobic environment in the heterodimer relative to the homodimer. The fluorescence spectrum of the heterodimer isolated by gel-filtration is virtually identical to the spectrum obtained by direct mixing of the proteins (data not shown).Figure 2Change in BARD1 tryptophan fluorescence upon heterodimer formation. Tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra (λex = 290 nm) of BD 26–152 homodimer (solid trace) and an equimolar mixture of BC-112 and BD 26–152 (dashed trace) are shown. The BD 26–152 homodimer exhibits an emission maximum at 347 nm, whereas the emission maximum of the BC-112/BD 26–152 heterodimer blue-shifts to 335 nm with a concomitant increase in fluorescence intensity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have previously demonstrated that the short BRCA1 construct, BC-76, forms a homodimer (17Brzovic P.S. Meza J. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7795-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, using the approaches described above, we do not detect heterodimer formation with BC-76 and BD 26–152 (data not shown). Furthermore, mixtures of BC-76 and BC-172 elute as two separate peaks from the gel-filtration column at volumes corresponding to the expected molecular weights of BC-76 and BC-172 homodimers (Fig.1 C). Similar results were obtained with mixtures of BC-76 and BC-112 (data not shown). Thus, the BC-76 RING finger construct does not dimerize with either BC-112, BC-172, or BD 26–152, indicating that specific and high affinity BRCA1 homodimerization and heterodimerization with BARD1 requires BRCA1 residues C-terminal to position 76. To identify the structural domains of BRCA1 and BARD1 required for heterodimerization, we used limited proteolysis in conjunction with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The premise behind this experimental approach is that regions of proteins that are structured are less susceptible to proteolysis than regions of proteins that are flexible or disordered. This approach has also been used to map regions of proteins involved in mediating interactions with other molecules (18Cohen S.L. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Chait B.T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1088-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The BC-112/BD 26–152 heterodimer was probed with endoprotease Endo Lys C, which cleaves on the C-terminal side of lysine residues. Fig.3 shows MALDI-TOF mass spectra that were collected at various times after the addition of protease. Although there are potential cleavage sites throughout the primary sequence of both BC-112 and BD 26–152 (see Fig. 6), cleavage only occurs in a limited number of sites. Twenty-five minutes after the addition of protease, BC-112 is cleaved mainly at Lys109, generating fragment BC 1–109 (Fig. 3 B). BC 1–109 is quite resistant to further proteolysis, persisting even 60 min into the reaction (Fig.3 C). Cleavage also occurs at Lys55 of BC-112, generating fragments 1–55 and 56–109, which are also resistant to further proteolysis. Our previous studies showed that this same site is also accessible in the BC-112 homodimer (17Brzovic P.S. Meza J. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7795-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). BD 26–152 quickly loses 22 residues from its C terminus, generating a BD 26–130 fragment (Fig.3 B), which is very stable: no additional cleavage occurs within the fragment even after 60 min of proteolysis (Fig.3 C). Limited proteolysis was also performed with V8, which cleaves on the C-terminal side of glutamate residues (see Fig. 6 for sequences). Sixty minutes after the addition of protease, BC-112 remained intact, whereas BARD1 was cleaved at residue 119, generating a stable BD 26–119 fragment (see Fig. 5 B). Taken together, these results show that BRCA1 and BARD1 RING finger motifs are part of larger structural domains, comprising the first 109 residues of BRCA1 and residues 26–119 of BARD1. Proteolytic susceptibilities of the homodimers and the heterodimer were compared to probe for distinguishing features among the species. Two shorter BARD1 constructs, BD 26–131 and BD 26–140 (Table I), engineered based on the proteolysis results reported above, were used with BC-112 in these experiments. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the mass spectra of Endo Lys C reactions of the two homodimers and the heterodimer show striking differences. Twenty-five minutes after digestion, the only species of BD 26–140 observed in the heterodimer reaction was the large BD 26–130 fragment (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, cleavage occurred at virtually every lysine in the BD 26–140 homodimer reaction (Fig. 4 C). The differences in susceptibility of BC-112 in the homodimerversus heterodimer are less striking than those of BD 26–140. Most of the same cleavages occur (Fig. 4, A andB) in the two forms, with one clear exception: cleavage occurs at an N-terminal lysine, Lys20, in the homodimer, but not in the heterodimer. Thus, the N-terminal region of BC-112 becomes protected upon dimerizing with BD 26–140. To further probe differences in the N-terminal region of BRCA1, limited proteolysis was performed with V8. The mass spectra shown in Fig.5 illustrate a pronounced difference in the proteolytic susceptibility between the BRCA1 homodimer and heterodimer to V8. The enzyme readily cleaved the N-terminal region of the homodimer, generating fragments BC 11–112, BC 11–100, and BC 11–75 (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, BC-112 remained completely intact in the heterodimer (Fig. 5 B). Taken together, the proteolysis results, summarized in Fig.6, clearly illustrate that in each case the homodimers are more susceptible to proteolysis than the heterodimer. Similar results were observed with the slightly shorter BD 26–131 construct (data not shown). We tested the ability of our RING finger constructs to bind nucleic acids using double- and single-stranded DNA cellulose and single-stranded RNA agarose (poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), and poly(U)) columns. Homodimeric (BC-112, BD 26–131, and BD 26–140) and heterodimeric (BC-112/BD 26–131 and BC-112/BD 26–140) complexes were applied to each nucleic acid column and eluted with a NaCl gradient. The zinc finger domain from ADR1 (a known DNA-binding domain from a yeast transcription factor) was used as a positive control (19Shuster J. Yu J. Cox D. Chan R.V.L. Smith M. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1894-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fig.7 shows the elution profiles for BC-112, BD 26–140, BC-112/BD 26–140, and the ADR1 zinc finger domain from a double-stranded DNA column. Whereas the ADR1 zinc finger was retained on the column, eluting at ∼400 mm NaCl, the RING finger complexes showed no affinity for double-stranded DNA, eluting in the void volume (50 mm NaCl). A general property of nucleic acid-binding proteins is that they exhibit detectable affinity to nonspecific nucleic acids. The sequence-specific DNA-binding ADR1 zinc finger domain displays this property. ADR1 bound to every column assayed, eluting from single-stranded DNA, poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), and poly(U) RNA columns at NaCl concentrations of ∼350, ∼325, ∼200, ∼400, and ∼150 mm, respectively. In direct contrast, neither homodimer nor the heterodimer displayed any affinity for the columns tested, with the protein eluting in the 50 mm NaCl wash in every case (data not shown). Similar results are observed with the BD 26–131 construct (data not shown). Although BRCA1 has been implicated in the maintenance of genome integrity (10Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K.

Science. 1996; 382: 678-679Google Scholar), little is known about its specific function in either of these processes. In an approach aimed at characterizing functional properties of BRCA1, we have focused on its interactions with BARD1, a protein shown to interact with BRCA1 in vivo (8Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that, individually, BRCA1 and BARD1 RING finger constructs exist as homodimers and that they preferentially form heterodimers. Limited proteolysis analysis defines the RING finger structural domains required for heterodimerization as comprising residues 1–109 of BRCA1 and residues 26–119 of BARD1. The heterodimer is remarkably stable, existing at concentrations well below 10−7m. 3Serial dilution experiments failed to detect dissociation of the dimers by either fluorescence or gel-filtration to the lowest concentrations at which a signal could be measured (J. Meza, P. Brzovic, and R. Klevit, unpublished observation). The RING finger motifs correspond to residues 24–64 and residues 50–86 in BRCA1 and BARD1, respectively. Thus, our results demonstrate that these motifs are part of a larger structural domain, rather than representing stable autonomous domains themselves. A similar situation exists for the recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG1) protein, the RING finger motif of which is also contained within a larger domain that exists as a homodimer in solution (21Bellon S.F. Rodgers K.K. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Steitz T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The three domains share little homology aside from the consensus RING finger motif residues, and RAG1 does not share additional sequence homology with either BRCA1 or BARD1. There are several reports of studies in which constructs that consist of a minimal RING finger motif sequence have been characterized, including a metal binding study of the RING finger (residues 22–77) of BRCA1 (22Roehm P.C. Berg J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and solution structure studies of the RING fingers from promyelocytic leukemia proto-oncoprotein and immediate-early equine herpesvirus-1 protein (11Barlow P.N. Luisi B. Milner A. Elliot M. Everett R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 23Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Lally J. O'Reilly N.J. Martin S. Howe K. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1532-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In contrast to BRCA1, BARD1, and RAG1, the short RING finger constructs used in the structure determinations were reported to be monomeric. In each case, however, the authors observed low solubility and a tendency of the constructs to aggregate. This is consistent with our experience with shorter RING finger constructs of BRCA1. 4J. Meza, P. Brzovic, and R. Klevit, unpublished observations. Although results derived from studies involving minimal RING finger constructs may provide interesting information, the use of suboptimal domains may not reflect properties of the native proteins. In contrast, longer constructs of BRCA1 and BARD1 have good solubility properties and are well behaved in solution, which are general properties of stable, folded structural domains. Our studies and others (8Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of BRCA1 is capable of high affinity protein-protein interactions with heterologous partners. There has been much speculation in the literature, however, concerning the role of RING finger domains as potential DNA-binding modules (3Saurin A.J. Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The conflicting reports on the DNA binding ability of RING finger domains, along with studies that implicate BRCA1 and BARD1 in DNA repair and transcriptional activation, led us to test the nucleic acid binding properties of our well behaved and well characterized RING finger constructs. Despite the fact that all the constructs are positively charged at neutral pH, with calculated pI values ranging from 7.7 to 8.4, neither homodimer nor the heterodimer exhibited any nucleic acid binding activity. Consequently, if BRCA1 and BARD1 play a role in DNA repair and/or transcriptional activation, interactions with DNA must be mediated either by other regions of the proteins or by additional cofactors. Proteolysis mapping and fluorescence experiments provide general structural insights as a preliminary step toward building a picture of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer. The strong protection from proteolysis of regions outside the RING finger motif afforded in the heterodimer suggests that these regions may play a direct role in the heterodimer interface. In contrast, Lys55, a residue within the BRCA1 RING finger motif, is susceptible to proteolysis both in the homodimer and the heterodimer, suggesting that it is surface-accessible in both forms. Therefore, the loop that contains Lys55, which is highly variable both in sequence and structure among known RING fingers, does not appear to play a direct role in heterodimer formation and may be accessible for interactions with other molecules. The significant blue shift and intensity enhancement of intrinsic tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence observed upon heterodimer formation indicates that at least one of the three BD 26–152 Trp residues becomes buried. Of the three Trp residues in BD 26–152 (see Fig. 6), Trp146 is very near the C-terminal end of the construct and is readily removed by proteases in the heterodimer, making it unlikely that Trp146 is responsible for the observed fluorescence change. The two other Trp residues (Trp34 and Trp91) flank the RING finger motif and are close to sites that become protected to proteolysis in the heterodimer, suggesting that one or both of these Trps undergo a change in environment. Results from gel-filtration (Fig. 1 A), cross-linking (Fig.1 B), and fluorescence (Fig. 2) studies convincingly show that the heterodimer is the preferred species in solution. Additionally, limited proteolysis results indicate that homodimers are consistently more susceptible to proteolysis than the heterodimer. BD 26–140 is cleaved by Endo Lys C at virtually every lysine residue in the homodimer, whereas cleavage occurs only at Lys130 in the heterodimer (Fig. 6). Likewise, BC-112 is susceptible to proteolysis at its N-terminal region in its homodimeric state, whereas the same region is protected in its heterodimeric state (Fig. 6). The added proteolytic protection afforded to the heterodimer is in good agreement with the observation that it is the preferred species in solution and suggests that it is a functionally relevant species in the cell. A major challenge in the study of breast cancer and other diseases is the determination of the functions of the proteins involved. An important early step in such efforts is the identification of structural domains and binding partners. Such a characterization can greatly aid in biochemical and functional studies of large multidomain, multifunctional proteins. The studies reported here are a first step in our goal to identify and understand the structure and function of the N-terminal regions of BRCA1 and BARD1."

Here, we demonstrate that megalin, a multifunctional endocytic receptor in the proximal tubular epithelium, mediates the uptake and degradation of PTH. Megalin was purified from kidney membranes as the major PTH-binding protein and shown in BIAcore analysis to specifically bind full-length PTH and amino-terminal PTH fragments (K d 0.5 μm). Absence of the receptor in megalin knockout mice resulted in 4-fold increased levels of amino-terminal PTH fragments in the urine. In F9 cells expressing both megalin and the PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor (PTH/PTHrP receptor), uptake and lysosomal degradation of the hormone was mediated through megalin. Blocking megalin-mediated clearance of PTH resulted in 3-fold increased stimulation of the PTH/PTHrP receptor. These data provide evidence that megalin is involved in the renal catabolism of PTH and potentially antagonizes PTH/PTHrP receptor activity in the proximal tubular epithelium.

Mammalian organisms therefore have developed an elaborate endocrine system to regulate the systemic calcium homeostasis. The parathyroid hormone (PTH)1 is the principal fast acting regulator of the calcium balance. It is produced in the parathyroid glands and released into circulation within minutes after the decline of extracellular calcium concentrations. There, PTH acts on several target tissues to mobilize calcium and to counterregulate hypocalcemia: 1) it induces osteoclastic breakdown of bone; 2) it increases tubular re-absorption of calcium in the kidney; and 3) it stimulates renal conversion of 25-OH vitamin D3 to 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3, which in turn increases intestinal absorption of dietary calcium (reviewed in Refs. 1Silver J.

Hypertens. 1995; 4: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the circulation, some PTH molecules are proteolytically cleaved between amino acids 33 and 39 to generate amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal fragments of the hormone. Whereas the carboxyl-terminal fragments are functionally inactive, the amino-terminal fragments exhibit biological properties similar to the full-length hormone (reviewed in Ref. 3Martin K.J. Hruska K.A. Freitag J.J. Klahr S. Slatopolsky E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1979; 301: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Both PTH 1-84 and amino-terminal fragments bind to a heptahelical receptor expressed in PTH target organs, the PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor (PTH/PTHrP receptor). This 60-kDa protein was cloned initially from proximal tubular cells and osteoblasts. It belongs to a novel family of G protein-coupled receptors characterized by seven transmembrane domains and at least two conserved N-linked glycosylation motifs (4Jüppner H. Abou-Samra A.-B. Freeman M. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Richards J. Kolakowski L.F. Hock J. Potts J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Science. 1991; 254: 1024-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar,5Abou-Samra A.B.

A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Upon binding of PTH, the PTH/PTHrP receptor transduces its signal through activation of adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C. The kidney not only is the prime target organ of PTH activity but it also plays an active role in the removal of the hormone from the circulation. This is suggested by several lines of experimental evidence. First, in patients with renal failure the plasma half-life of the hormone is significantly increased (6St.-John A. Thomas M.B. Davies C.P. Mullan B. Dick I. Hutchison B. van-der-Schaff A. Prince R.L. Nephron. 1992; 61: 422-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lepage R. Roy L. Brossard J.H. Rousseau L. Dorais C. Lazure C. D'Amour P. Clin. Chem. 1998; 44: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in organ perfusion studies, PTH was shown to be lost from the plasma mainly by glomerular filtration followed by re-absorption and degradation in the proximal tubules (8Kau S.T. Maack T. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 223: F445-F454Google Scholar, 9Daugaard H. Egfjord M. Olgaard K. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: E740-E748PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, cellular uptake and degradation of PTH was demonstrated directly in cultured proximal tubular cells. In these cells, the PTH/PTHrP receptor was suggested to mediate the uptake and degradation of the hormone (10Yamaguchi T. Arad M. Fukase M. Acta Endocrinol. 1992; 127: 267-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Brown R.C. Silver A.C. Woodhead J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: E544-E552PubMed Google Scholar). Whether this receptor is also responsible for systemic clearance of PTH or whether alternative uptake mechanisms exist in vivo remained unclear. Recently, a major endocytic receptor pathway for uptake of ligands from the glomerular filtrate has been elucidated in the proximal tubules. Megalin is a multifunctional clearance receptor expressed on the apical surface of the proximal tubular epithelium (12Kerjaschki D. Farquhar M.G. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 667-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Cloning of the rat cDNA revealed that megalin is a member of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene family (13Saito A. Pietromonaco S. Loo A.K.-C. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9725-9729Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Like other members of this gene family, megalin exhibits a broad ligand specificity and mediates the uptake and lysosomal degradation of numerous macromolecules. Ligands internalized by megalin in the proximal tubules include albumin and trans-cobalamin/vitamin B12 complexes (14Cui S. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. Christensen E.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F900-F907PubMed Google Scholar, 15Moestrup S.K. Birn H. Fischer P.B. Petersen C.M. Verroust P.J. Sim R.B. Christensen E.I. Nexo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8612-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The significance of megalin for tubular function is underscored by the finding that the receptor resorbs aminoglycosides from the glomerular filtrate and is therefore responsible for the nephrotoxicity associated with these compounds (16Moestrup S.K. Cui S. Vorum H. Bregengard C. Bjorn S.E. Norris K. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1404-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The central role of megalin in the tubular resorption processes was further confirmed in mice genetically deficient for the receptor. Most megalin-deficient newborns die perinatally from holoprosencephaly, a developmental defect of the forebrain (17Willnow T.E. Hilpert J. Armstrong S.A. Rohlmann A. Hammer R.E. Burns D.K. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The causes underlying this defect have not been elucidated with certainty, but the severity of the phenotype varies among individual animals and 1 in 50 of the megalin−/−mice survives to adulthood. Absence of the receptor in the kidneys of these mice results in tubular resorption deficiency and excretion of low molecular weight plasma proteins in the urine. 2A. Nykjaer, H. Vorum, D. Dragun, D. Walther, C. Jacobsen, J. Herz, F. Melsen, E. I. Christensen, and T. E. Willnow, manuscript submitted for publication. 2A. Nykjaer, H. Vorum, D. Dragun, D. Walther, C. Jacobsen, J. Herz, F. Melsen, E. I. Christensen, and T. E. Willnow, manuscript submitted for publication. The current study was conducted to investigate a potential role of megalin in the renal catabolism of PTH. We show that megalin mediates the cellular uptake and degradation of PTH and that receptor-deficient mice exhibit impaired renal catabolism of the hormone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that megalin-mediated degradation of PTH antagonizes activation of the PTH/PTHrP receptor. Mature bovine PTH as well as bovine and human PTH fragments were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen). Rabbit anti-human PTH antibody was purchased from Accurate Chemicals (Westbury, NY). Sheep anti-rat megalin antibody was a gift from P. Verroust (INSERM, Paris). Polyclonal antibodies directed against rat PTH/PTHrP receptor were obtained from BAbCO (Richmond, CA) or kindly provided by A. Abou-Samra (MGH, Boston). Proteins were radiolabeled with 125I using the IODO-GEN method (19Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). The coding region of amino acids 1 to 84 of mature PTH present on exon 3 of the bovine PTH gene (20Weaver C.A. Gordon D.F. Kissil M.S. Mead D.A. Kemper B. Gene. 1984; 28: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic calf liver DNA using primers: 5′-GATCCTCATCATATGGCTGTGAGTGAAATACAGTTT-3′ and 5′-GGTGGGATCCCTATTACTGGGGTTTAGCTTTAATTAATA-3′. NdeI and BamHI restriction sites in the polymerase chain reaction primers were used to clone the amplified PTH gene fragment into vector pET-14B (Novagen, Madison, WI). Expression of this vector results in a recombinant PTH molecule carrying an amino-terminal extension of 6 histidine residues and a thrombin cleavage site (recPTH). Integrity of the PTH gene sequence was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. For purification, the expression plasmid was introduced intoEscherichia coli strain BL-21pLys (Novagen). RecPTH was recovered from bacterial lysate by standard nickel-affinity chromatography (Qiagen, Hilden). 5 mg of purified recPTH was coupled to 2 ml of CNBr-activated-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia, Uppsala) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Crude rat kidney membrane extracts were prepared as described previously (17Willnow T.E. Hilpert J. Armstrong S.A. Rohlmann A. Hammer R.E. Burns D.K. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). 80 mg of membrane extracts were diluted in 100 ml Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% Triton X-100, and circulated over the PTH column for 16 h at 4 °C. The column was washed with 100 ml Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% CHAPS, and bound proteins were eluted in 100 mm glycine, 0.5% CHAPS, pH 2.8. Binding of PTH fragments to megalin was quantified by BIAcore (Biosensor, Sweden). Briefly, rabbit megalin immobilized on CM5 sensor chip (34 fmol/receptor/mm2) was incubated with PTH peptides (10–50 μg/ml) in 10 mmHEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4, and the relative increase in response between megalin and control flow channels was determined. Kinetic parameters were determined by using the BIA evaluation 3.0 software. Number of ligands bound per immobilized receptor molecule was estimated by dividing the ratio RUligand/massligand with RUreceptor/massreceptor. Mouse F9 embryonal carcinoma cells (ATCC, CRL-1720, Manassas, VA) were cultured in standard medium (DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum) and induced with 1 μm trans-retinoic acid and 1 μmdibutyryl cAMP (21Van de Stolpe A. Karperien M. Löwik C.W.G.M. Jüppner H. Segre G.V. Abou-Samra A.-B. de Laat S.W. Defize L.H.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22Stefansson S.

Cellular degradation of the125I-ligands added to the culture medium was determined by standard protocols (23Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar) and expressed as nanograms of125I-labeled trichloroacetic acid-soluble (noniodide) material released into the culture medium per mg of total cell protein. For urine collection, mice were placed in metabolic cages for 16 h and given 10% sucrose in drinking water. Urine samples obtained were qualitatively indistinguishable from samples collected without sucrose load. Urine volume per hour and creatinine levels were identical in megalin−/− and in control mice (data not shown). PTH fragments in urine were measured by radioimmunoassays developed for rat PTH fragment 1-38 (Immundiagnostik, Bensheim) or human PTH fragment 35-84 (Diagnostic Systems, Sinsheim), and shown to recognize mouse PTH. Concentrations of cAMP in cells and in the culture medium was determined as described (24Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). Student′s t test was used to determine the statistical significance of data points. In initial experiments, we intended to identify proteins in the kidney that interact with PTH and potentially play a role in the renal catabolism of the hormone. To do so, a fusion protein of mature bovine PTH with an amino-terminal hexahistidine epitope (recPTH) was produced in bacteria and coupled to Sepharose resin. Total membrane extracts from rat kidneys were applied to this recPTH affinity column. The column was washed extensively and bound proteins were eluted in low pH buffer. Reproducibly, two major protein bands were identified that bound specifically to the PTH column (Fig.1, lane 2). No binding was observed in Sepharose columns lacking PTH (data not shown). The 60-kDa protein eluted from the PTH column was identified as the renal PTH/PTHrP receptor using antibodies against rat PTH/PTHrP receptor (lane 3). A second protein of high molecular weight also bound to the PTH column (lane 2). This protein was identified as megalin by Western blot analysis (lane 4). The ability of megalin to interact with PTH was investigated in more detail using plasmon surface resonance (BIAcore) analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 A, megalin immobilized on the BIA sensor chip bound recPTH reversibly. Ligand binding was dependent on calcium and abolished by the addition of EDTA, a characteristic feature of ligand binding to megalin. The intensity of the binding response signal indicated two PTH binding sites per receptor molecule. To further map the receptor binding epitope on PTH, binding of PTH fragments to megalin was analyzed (Fig. 2 B). PTH 1-34 bound specifically to the receptor, eliciting a response signal equal to half that of the full-length hormone (300versus 600 response units). Because PTH 1-34 exhibits half the molecular weight of recPTH, this result indicated that the same number of receptor binding sites were occupied by PTH 1-34 and recPTH. In the same assay, no binding was observed for PTH 39-84. The exact binding affinities of recPTH, native bovine PTH, and various PTH fragments were calculated from the BIAcore analysis data (TableI). Bovine PTH, recPTH, recPTH in which the His6 epitope was removed by thrombin cleavage (recPTH*), and the amino-terminal fragment PTH 1-44 bound with similar affinities (∼0.4–3 μm). In contrast, carboxyl-terminal PTH fragments did not bind at all. Binding of PTH 1-34 was weaker than that of PTH 1-44 (26 versus 3.2 μm) suggesting that amino acids 35 to 44 may contribute to receptor binding. In conclusion, these studies demonstrated that megalin recognizes the amino-terminal region of PTH which has already been shown to harbor the PTH/PTHrP receptor recognition site (4Jüppner H.

No binding was detected for PTH fragments 39–84 and 28–48. It is well established that ligands bound to megalin are subjected to cellular uptake and lysosomal degradation. To test whether the receptor also mediates the degradation of recPTH, we investigated the catabolism of the hormone in F9 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells. Upon stimulation with trans-retinoic acid and dibutyryl cAMP, these cells express high levels of megalin and the PTH/PTHrP receptor (Fig.3, inset) (21Van de Stolpe A. Karperien M. Löwik C.W.G.M.

Expression of other receptors of the LDL receptor gene family is either not increased (LDL receptor) or even reduced (LDL receptor-related protein) upon stimulation (Fig. 3, inset). Induction of megalin and PTH/PTHrP receptor expression in F9 cells correlated with a 3-fold increase in 125I-recPTH degradation as compared with noninduced control cells (Fig. 3; p < 0.009). To dissect the contribution of different pathways for PTH degradation, we investigated the cellular catabolism of 125I-recPTH in the presence of various inhibitors (Fig. 4). The receptor-associated protein (RAP) is a cellular chaperone which blocks binding of all known ligands to megalin (25Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These antagonistic properties of RAP can be exploited to specifically interfere with megalin-mediated ligand uptake into cells (16Moestrup S.K. Cui S. Vorum H. Bregengard C. Bjorn S.E. Norris K. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1404-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 26Morales C.R. Igdoura S.A. Wosu U.A. Boman J. Argraves W.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RAP fusion protein was added to the culture medium of F9 cells, the amount of PTH degraded was reduced by 50% as compared with control cells that received GST only. (Fig. 4 A, columns 1 and 2,p < 0.006). PTH degradation was blocked to the same extend by chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation (Fig.4 A, column 3, p < 0.001). A combination of GST-RAP and chloroquine had no additive inhibitory effect (Fig. 4 A, column 4), suggesting that lysosomal degradation of PTH is mediated through a RAP-sensitive receptor. Because only 50% of PTH degradation was mediated through lysosomal pathways, we reasoned that extracellular proteolytic activity might be responsible for the residual catabolism of the hormone. In particular, extracellular processing of 125I-recPTH into amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal fragments would result in the generation of labeled PTH peptides that are trichloroacetic acid-soluble and indistinguishable from lysosomal degradation products in our assay. This hypothesis was confirmed by application of chymostatin, a protease inhibitor that blocks extracellular processing of PTH (27Yamaguchi T. Fukase M. Nishikawa M. Fujimi T. Fujita T. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2812-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Addition of chymostatin reduced the amount of125I-degradation products by 50% (Fig. 4 A,column 5, p < 0.001), and the combined application of chymostatin and RAP inhibited the degradation of the hormone almost completely (Fig. 4 A, column 6,p < 0.009). This indicated that a RAP-binding receptor was primarily responsible for lysosomal degradation of full-length PTH in these cells. To test whether the PTH/PTHrP receptor might be affected by RAP, we tested binding of 125I-RAP to F9 cell membrane preparations separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. In this ligand binding assay,125I-RAP bound strongly to a high molecular weight protein co-migrating with megalin (Fig. 4 B). No significant binding to other membrane proteins including the PTH/PTHrP receptor was observed (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Inhibition by GST-RAP, chloroquine and chymostatin of 125I-recPTH degradation in F9 cells. A, induced F9 cells received 1 ml of DMEM (without glutamine) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 27 ng/ml125I-recPTH (3,720 cpm/ng). Where indicated, the medium included 90 μg/ml GST (columns 1, 3, and5), 90 μg/ml GST-RAP (columns 2, 4, and 6), 200 μm chloroquine (columns 3 and 4) and 50 μg/ml chymostatin (columns 5 and 6). The amount of 125I-recPTH degradation products secreted into the medium was determined after incubation for 120 min at 37 °C. B, F9 cell membrane extracts were separated by 4–15% SDS-PAGE (20 μg of protein/lane) followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose strip on the left was preincubated in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Then, 67 ng/ml 125I-GST-RAP (1,480 cpm/ng) were added to the incubation buffer for 1 h. Bound125I-GST-RAP was detected by autoradiography for 16 h at −70 °C.

Hilpert J. Armstrong S.A. Rohlmann A. Hammer R.E. Burns D.K. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). These animals were used to evaluate the consequence of megalin deficiency for the renal catabolism of PTH. Consistent with a role of the receptor in the tubular uptake of biologically active PTH peptides, levels of amino-terminal PTH fragments in urine of knockout mice were increased 4-fold as compared with control litter mates (374 ± 48versus 87.5 ± 29 pmol/liter; p < 0.002). In contrast, levels of carboxyl-terminal PTH fragments were unchanged (354.6 ± 76 versus 345.4 ± 45.2 pmol/liter). At the same time, the megalin gene defect did not affect the total amount or subcellular localization of the PTH/PTHrP receptor in proximal tubular cells as shown by immunohistochemistry (Fig.5) and Western blot analysis (data not shown). Finally, the significance of megalin for tubular catabolism of PTH was confirmed by microinfusion of 125I-labeled recPTH into rat proximal tubules in vivo (with method described in Ref. 16Moestrup S.K. Cui S. Vorum H. Bregengard C. Bjorn S.E. Norris K. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1404-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In these micropuncture experiments, 50.6 ± 0.9% of labeled recPTH was taken up into the tubules. The uptake of125I-recPTH was significantly impaired when RAP was co-infused into the tubules (41.1 ± 2.8%; p < 0.025). Similar effects have been observed for other receptor ligands previously (16Moestrup S.K. Cui S. Vorum H. Bregengard C. Bjorn S.E. Norris K. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1404-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The results obtained so far have established a dual receptor system in the renal proximal tubules that recognizes full-length and amino-terminal PTH fragments. This receptor system consists of the PTH/PTHrP receptor that transduces PTH signals and of the endocytic receptor megalin that mediates the catabolism of the hormone. It was of particular interest to learn about the significance of this dual receptor system for PTH activity. So far, the limited number (n = 8) of megalin−/− animals available and their complex phenotype confounded the detailed analysis of their PTH metabolism. We therefore focused on PTH-mediated signal transduction in F9 cells. First, the ability of recPTH to stimulate the PTH/PTHrP receptor was tested (Fig.6 A). When recPTH was added to F9 cells, cAMP levels did not rise above the level in untreated control cells (columns 1 and 2). However, when recPTH was applied together with an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase activity (isobutylmethylxanthine) a significant increase in cAMP levels was observed (columns 3 and 4,p < 0.014). To study the influence of megalin on PTH/PTHrP receptor activity, we next determined PTH-induced signal transduction in the presence of the megalin inhibitor RAP (Fig.6 B). As already shown in Fig. 6 A, recPTH alone did not increase steady state cAMP levels (column 3). In contrast, addition of recPTH and RAP caused a 3-fold elevation of cellular cAMP concentrations (column 4) even in the absence of isobutylmethylxanthine (p < 0.012). GST or GST-RAP had no direct effect on cAMP levels (columns 1 and 2). These results demonstrated that megalin-mediated degradation of PTH antagonizes activation of the PTH/PTHrP receptor. We have identified megalin as an endocytic receptor for the cellular uptake and degradation of PTH. The receptor was purified from kidney membranes as a major PTH-binding protein and shown in BIAcore analysis to bind full-length PTH and amino-terminal PTH fragments. In F9 cells and in microinfused proximal tubules, uptake and lysosomal degradation of the hormone was mediated through megalin. Expression of the receptor in the proximal tubular epithelium and enhanced excretion of amino-terminal but not carboxyl-terminal PTH fragments in urine of megalin−/− mice suggests that the receptor also plays an important role in the renal catabolism of the hormone in vivo. A renal endocytic pathway for uptake and degradation of PTH has been anticipated by findings that the kidney is largely responsible for removal of the hormone from the circulation. In isolated perfused kidneys, PTH and PTH fragments are mainly cleared through glomerular filtration and re-absorbtion in the proximal tubules (8Kau S.T. Maack T. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 223: F445-F454Google Scholar, 9Daugaard H. Egfjord M. Olgaard K. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: E740-E748PubMed Google Scholar). In both patients and laboratory animals, plasma PTH levels are directly correlated with glomerular filtration rates and clearance of PTH is blocked in nonfiltering kidneys (6St.-John A. Thomas M.B. Davies C.P. Mullan B. Dick I. Hutchison B. van-der-Schaff A. Prince R.L. Nephron. 1992; 61: 422-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Daugaard H. Egfjord M. Lewin E. Olgaard K. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Previously, two types of PTH binding sites have been identified in renal membrane preparations that could be involved in the tubular catabolism of the hormone: high affinity (K d ∼ 10 nm) and low affinity binding sites (K d ∼ 1 μm) (29Demay M. Mitchell J. Goltzman D. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: E437-E446PubMed Google Scholar, 30Rizzoli R.E. Murray T.M. Marx S.J. Aurbach G.D. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 1303-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The high affinity binding sites are coupled to G proteins and most likely represent the PTH/PTHrP receptor (31Teitelbaum A.P. Nissenson R.A. Arnaud C.D. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 1524-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, the low affinity binding sites are not linked to G proteins (30Rizzoli R.E. Murray T.M. Marx S.J. Aurbach G.D. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 1303-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and potentially represent the endocytic receptor megalin. This is indicated by the fact that megalin is a major PTH-binding protein in the kidney (Fig. 1) and exhibits PTH binding affinities in the micromolar range (Table I). Although megalin binds recPTH in vitro with an affinity significantly below the circulating levels of the hormone, this does not exclude a role of the receptor in the renal uptake of PTHin vivo. Megalin is one of the most abundant membrane proteins on the brush border surface of the proximal tubules, and its abundance could compensate for low affinity in ligand uptake. For example, polybasic drugs such as aminoglycosides, aprotinin, and polymyxin B are efficiently internalized by megalin in the proximal tubules. The affinity of the receptor for these compounds is similar to the one for PTH (16Moestrup S.K. Cui S. Vorum H. Bregengard C. Bjorn S.E. Norris K. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1404-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The degradation of PTH was investigated in a number of established proximal tubular cell lines. In opossum kidney cells most PTH was subjected to endocytosis and lysosomal degradation, whereas a minor fraction of the hormone was metabolized by extracellular chymotrypsin-like endopeptidases (10Yamaguchi T. Arad M. Fukase M. Acta Endocrinol. 1992; 127: 267-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Brown R.C. Silver A.C. Woodhead J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: E544-E552PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yamaguchi T. Fukase M. Nishikawa M. Fujimi T. Fujita T. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2812-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that in opossum kidney cells the PTH/PTHrP receptor is responsible for the endocytic uptake of the hormone. However, no specific antagonist other than PTH peptides have been available to specifically block the PTH/PTHrP receptor and to investigate the potential contribution of various receptor pathways to PTH clearance. We have analyzed PTH degradation in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells where expression of megalin and the PTH/PTHrP receptor can be co-induced bytrans-retinoic acid and dibutyryl cAMP. Although not of tubular origin, high levels of PTH/PTHrP receptor and megalin expression mimics well the situation in the proximal tubules in vivo. Similar to opossum kidney cells, F9 cells metabolized PTH both by extracellular proteolysis and by lysosomal degradation (Fig.4 A). The latter pathway most likely involves megalin, because lysosomal degradation was blocked by RAP. This inhibitor does not bind to the PTH/PTHrP receptor (Fig. 4 B) or affect its function directly (Fig. 6 B). In addition, we have investigated the degradation of PTH in porcine proximal tubular cells (LLC-PK1). These cells express megalin but not the PTH/PTHrP receptor (32Gstraunthaler G.J.A. Renal Physiol. Biochem. 1988; 11: 1-42PubMed Google Scholar). 3J. Hilpert, A. Nykjaer, C. Jacobsen, G. Wallukat, R. Nielsen, S. K. Moestrup, H. Haller, F. C. Luft, E. I. Christensen, and T. E. Willnow, unpublished observations. Again, more than 80% of PTH degradation in these cells was blocked by RAP (data not shown). Finally, we analyzed the PTH catabolism in mice genetically deficient for megalin. These animals specifically excreted increased levels of amino-terminal but not carboxyl-terminal PTH fragments. Endocytic mechanisms are known to modulate signal transduction pathways. Upon binding of signaling molecules, a number of signaling receptors undergo rapid sequestration and internalization. Consequently, the total number of receptor molecules on the cell surface is reduced, and target cells are protected from overstimulation by excess ligands (down-regulation). The PTH/PTHrP receptor also has been shown to undergo endocytosis after PTH binding (33Teitelbaum A.P. Silve C.M. Nyiredy K.O. Arnaud C.D. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Mahoney C.A. Nissenson R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 7: 411-421Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Both positive and negative regulatory elements controlling endocytosis have been identified in the carboxyl-terminal tail of this receptor (35Huang Z. Chen Y. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 151-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An alternative endocytic mechanism regulating signal transduction has been identified in the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) signaling pathway. IGF-II is a growth factor that controls mitogenic processes during embryonic development via binding to the IGF-I receptor. Loss of IGF-I receptor or IGF-II expression in knockout mice results in a growth-deficiency phenotype (36DeChiara T.M. Efstratiadis A. Robertson E.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar, 37Liu J.-P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2578) Google Scholar). IGF-II also binds to the IGF-II/cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, which mediates internalization and lysosomal degradation of the growth factor. Gene inactivation of cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor results in increased circulating levels of IGF-II and, as a consequence, in overgrowth of embryonic tissues. These findings demonstrate that cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor is essential to reduce circulating levels of IGF-II and to protect the IGF-I receptor from overstimulation (18Wang Z.-Q. Fung M.R. Barlow D.P. Wagner E.F. Nature. 1994; 372: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 38Lau M.M.H. Steward C.E.H. Liu Z. Bhatt H. Rotwein P. Stewart C.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2953-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). On the basis of our findings, it is intriguing to speculate that megalin might play a similar role in regulation of the PTH/PTHrP receptor activity. According to this model, endocytosis of the PTH/PTHrP receptor predominantly regulates the availability of signaling receptors on the cell surface, whereas megalin removes excessive ligands from the extracellular space. In F9 cells, such an antagonistic property of megalin was demonstrated (Fig.6 B). Additional support for this hypothesis comes from the fact that megalin only recognizes full-length and amino-terminal PTH fragments that are able to stimulate the PTH/PTHrP receptor. Biologically inactive fragments of the carboxyl-terminal region of the hormone are not bound (Fig. 2 and Table I). Furthermore, megalin and the PTH/PTHrP receptor are co-localized on the brush border surface of the proximal tubular epithelium (Fig. 5) where megalin could regulate PTH concentrations locally. At present, the limited number of megalin knockout animals available and their complex phenotype makes it difficult to test this conceptin vivo. The generation of mouse models with kidney-specific megalin gene defect will be helpful in answering this important question.

It has been known for many years that, in interphase nuclei, the chromatin is not uniformly decondensed but contains a considerable amount of more compact material, called heterochromatin (22Heitz E. Jahrb. Wissench. Bot. 1928; 69: 762-818Google Scholar), which generally increases during the terminal stages of eukaryotic cell differentiation (23Frenster J.H. Busch H. The Cell Nucleus. 1. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 565-581Google Scholar). Much cytological and genetic evidence suggests that chromatin compaction (spreading of heterochromatin) is associated with position-specific genetic inactivation (24John B. Verma R.S. Heterochromatin: Molecular and Structural Aspects. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1988: 1-147Google Scholar, 25Lohe A. Hilliker A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

A surprisingly high diversity of structurally distinct heterochromatin-associated proteins has been reported. For example, SIR3, SIR4, and RAP1 proteins are involved in telomeric silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (29Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 30Cockell M. Palladino F. Laroche T. Kyrion G. Liu C. Lustig A.J. Gasser S.M. J.

Berns A. Lohuizen M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 226-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although several studies have indicated that stable alterations of chromatin higher order folding distinguish the organization of euchromatin and heterochromatin (13Weintraub H. Cell. 1984; 38: 17-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 36Weith A. Chromosoma. 1985; 91: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37Wallrath L.L. Elgin S.C.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1263-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), the structural determinants and the molecular mechanism of heterochromatin formation and spreading are still obscure. Terminal cell differentiation provides a convenient system for biochemical studies of the coordinated formation of heterochromatin and associated genetic inactivation. In particular, blood cell differentiation or hemopoiesis has been extensively studied both for its applicability to gene regulation and for its intrinsic significance for oncology (38Metcalf D. Nature. 1989; 339: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 39Sachs L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4742-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the normal developmental sequence, the number of expressed genes becomes drastically reduced (40Tobin A.J. Selvig S.E. Lasky L. Dev. Biol. 1978; 67: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 41Beaulieu A. Paquin R. Rathanaswami P. McColl S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 426-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the nuclear chromatin undergoes a considerable increase in condensation (see reviews in Ref. 42), and nuclear matrix components, which are associated with transcriptional activity, are progressively lost (43LaFond R.E. Woodcock C.L.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 147: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Based on the hypothesis that the extensive heterochromatin spreading in blood cells is caused by one or more of the relatively few proteins that are still expressed during terminal differentiation, we have sought highly abundant nuclear proteins that specifically interact with repressed chromatin and are confined to the late stages of cell differentiation. Our study has yielded an abundant developmentally regulated 42-kDa nuclear protein, MENT (myeloid anderythroid nuclear termination stage-specific protein). This protein is expressed in terminally differentiated blood cells, is associated with repressed chromatin, and is able to induce large scale condensation of nuclear chromatin and the dissociation of inactivated chromatin from the nuclear matrix in vitro (44Grigoryev S.A. Solovieva V.O. Spirin K.S. Krasheninnikov I.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 198: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 45Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). MENT is present in all three main avian blood cell types (erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and granulocytes) and is especially abundant in granulocytes, where it becomes the predominant nuclear nonhistone protein (∼2 molecules/nucleosome) and is concentrated in the compact peripheral heterochromatin (46Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MENT-like polypeptides have also been found in chromatin of mammalian leukocytes. 2S. Grigoryev, unpublished observations. 2S. Grigoryev, unpublished observations. We have isolated the compact granulocyte chromatin in a soluble form and applied cryoelectron microscopy, a powerful imaging technique permitting the visualizing of the native organization of unfixed biological material (47Dubochet J. Adrian M. Chang J.J. Homo J.C. Lepault J. McDowall A.W. Schultz P. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1988; 21: 129-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar) to the study of heterochromatin conformation. For the first time, we have documented a direct link between heterochromatin and higher order folding of nucleosome arrays that is attributed to the accumulation of a single nonhistone protein, MENT, in chromatin fibers. We have cloned the MENT cDNA, deduced the protein primary structure, and identified the protein structural motifs that may account for the molecular interactions of MENT. The combined results suggest a molecular basis for the formation of MENT-directed heterochromatin. Polymorphonuclear granulocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of adult white leghorn chicken as described (46Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells (CV-1 simian cells transformed with origin-defective SV-40 virus expressing wild-type T antigen, ATCC number CRL-1651) were grown to 80% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (D-5796; Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum (F-2442; Sigma) and 1 mm pyruvate. Cell cultures were washed 2 times in PBS containing 0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.7 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, and the cells were resuspended in PBS using a cell scraper. To isolate the nuclei, cell suspensions of granulocytes or COS-7 cells in PBS were centrifuged for 3 min at 1000 × g and resuspended in reticulocyte standard buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40; Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. With granulocyte nuclear preparations, the NaCl concentration varied between 0 and 0.3m. The cell suspensions were homogenized by 20–30 strokes of pestle A in a Dounce homogenizer over 30 min on ice. Nuclei were centrifuged for 10 min at 7600 × g, and the nuclear pellets were resuspended in reticulocyte standard buffer plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Isolated nuclei could be stored for a week at +2 °C without a detectable DNA or protein degradation. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion of all types of nuclei was conducted as described (46Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and terminated by adding EDTA to 10 mm. To obtain soluble chromatin, the nuclei were digested with MNase to obtain an average DNA fragment size between 400 and 6000 bp and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant S1 was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of TEN (Tris-EDTA-NaCl buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl). Supernatant S2 containing more than 50% of the input nuclear chromatin was then obtained after centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The nuclear pellets were washed once more with 1 ml of TEN buffer with centrifugation to provide the S3 supernatant, and the nuclear remnant fraction was obtained by dissolving the final pellet in 1 ml of 0.5% SDS. DNA electrophoresis in agarose, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins, detection of proteins and nucleic acids, Western blotting, probing with anti-MENT antibodies, and quantitative densitometry of electrophoregrams were conducted as before (46Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Protein to DNA ratios were estimated from parallel measurements of DNA concentration by UV spectrophotometry (A 260 = 1 for 50 μg/ml DNA). For size fractionation of soluble chromatin, 0.5 ml of S-150 sample containing 0.2 mg/ml DNA was loaded on a 5–25% sucrose gradient (12 ml) containing TAEW (25 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm Na2-EDTA, 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4) or HEN (HEPES-EDTA-NaCl buffer containing 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Ultracentrifugation was carried out in an SW-41 rotor on a Beckman L8–50 ultracentrifuge for 3 h at 4 °C and 35,000 rpm. 1-ml fractions were collected and used for protein and DNA electrophoreses. The chromatin pellet (fraction 1) was resuspended from the bottom of the tube in 1 ml of 0.5% SDS. Cryoelectron microscopy using soluble chromatin samples (50–100 μg/ml in TEN buffer) was conducted as described (5Bednar J. Horowitz R.A. Dubochet J. Woodcock C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1365-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 48Woodcock C.L. Horowitz R.A. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 84-95Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Specifically, 3-μl chromatin samples were applied to holey carbon films, blotted with Whatman 52 filter paper, and plunged into liquid ethane held just above its freezing point in liquid nitrogen. Grids were transferred under liquid nitrogen to a cryoholder (model 626; Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA), and observed at −170 °C in an electron microscope (CM10; Philips Electronic Instruments Co., Mahwah, NJ) at a nominal magnification of × 45,000. Tilt pairs of micrographs (angular separation 30°) at 1.1–1.5-μm defocus, were recorded in low dose mode, on film S0–163 (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) and developed in full-strength D-19 (Kodak) for 12 min. MENT protein was isolated from the nuclei of unfractionated chicken blood cells as described (44Grigoryev S.A. Solovieva V.O. Spirin K.S. Krasheninnikov I.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 198: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Five peptides derived from isolated MENT were sequenced. For PCR-mediated cloning of MENT cDNA, we designed redundant oligonucleotide primers as described (49Wilkie T.M. Aragay A.M. Watson A.J. Simon M.I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The 20–22-nucleotide-long primers were deduced from MENT regions with minimally degenerate codons. Total RNA and poly(A)+mRNA was isolated from 1 g of chicken bone marrow using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the Message Maker RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies), and the first strand cDNA synthesis was conducted using the Life Technologies Superscript preamplification system essentially as described in the vendor's manual. PCR amplifications with degenerate primers were carried out using the AmpliTherm polymerase and MasterAmp PCR optimization kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). Amplification cycles were carried out in 30-μl samples using a high melting wax for “hot start” conditions. The first denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C was followed with 35 cycles, each containing three 1-min steps at 94, 42, and 72 °C, and finally for 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were cloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using the Sequenase II system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). One of the sequenced PCR products amplified between the primers specific for peptides 1 (ATIGGIAA(C/T)TT(C/T)ACIGTIGA) and 3 (TGIAT(A/G)TT(C/T)TCIGC(C/T)TG(C/T)TC) also included the sequence of peptide 2, indicating that this PCR product was derived from the target MENT cDNA. To restore the 5′-end of the cDNA, we employed the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR technique (50Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar) essentially as described (51Schuster D.M. Buchman G.W. Rashtchian A. Focus. 1992; 14: 46-52Google Scholar). The 3′-end of the cDNA was restored using the 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR method (50Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified DNA fragments were inserted into pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced on both strands, revealing a 1230-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding all five independently sequenced MENT peptides. To verify the ORF sequence, PCR amplification was repeated with two nonredundant primers flanking the MENT ORF, and the product was inserted in the pCRII vector and sequenced on both strands with the Sequenase II system. MENT ORF was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR with oligonucleotide primers containing appropriate restrictase sites and inserted in pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen) to provide a MENT-expressing plasmid, pSG109. COS-7 cells were transfected with pSG109 and SuperFect transfection media (Qiagen) as described in the vendor's manual. Transfected cells were grown for 48 h. Fixing of cells attached to the cover glasses with methanol/acetone and staining with anti-MENT antibodies and DNA dyes (10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258) was performed essentially as described (45Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For double-staining with anti-MENT and anti-fibrillarin (52Pollard K.M. Lee D.K. Casiano C.A. Bluthner M. Johnston M.M. Tan E.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3521-3528PubMed Google Scholar) antibodies, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Fluorescence and confocal microscopy were conducted as described (45Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A search for DNA and protein homologies in the available data banks was performed using the BLAST program (53Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70277) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments were conducted using the Wisconsin package version 9.1 (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). The protein pI was calculated as described (54Bjellqvist B. Basse B. Olsen E. Celis J.E. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To build the three-dimensional protein model, we employed the ProModII software (55Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 56Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9554) Google Scholar). The model-building resources are provided by the automated protein modeling server, Swiss Model (Glaxo Wellcome Experimental Research, Geneva, Switzerland), which is accessible through the Internet. The protein models were visualized using the Swiss-PDB viewer program compatible with Windows 95TM. Modeling of electrostatic and surface properties of the molecules was performed using the GRASP program (Graphical Representation and Analysis of Surface Properties (57Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar)) running on a Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation with operating system IRIX 5.3. Highly condensed chromatin from chicken granulocyte nuclei has a nucleosome repeat (192 ± 2 bp) and a core and linker histone content (46Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) similar to that of many cells with much more active genomes (1van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). Unlike most other types of chromatin, which are readily solubilized after MNase digestion and removal of divalent cations, granulocyte nuclei digested to DNA fragment sizes between 200 and 20,000 bp did not release any soluble chromatin after repeated washing in low salt/high pH media. Our previous work suggested that MENT, an extremely abundant granulocyte chromatin protein (2.1 molecules/nucleosome) was the most likely factor inhibiting chromatin solubility (46Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To address the impact of auxiliary proteins on chromatin conformation, it was essential to isolate granulocyte chromatin from the nuclei while maintaining its association with MENT. We therefore determined the optimal salt concentration allowing chromatin solubilization with a minimal loss of associated chromatin proteins by preparing a series of granulocyte chromatin fractions eluted from nuclease-digested nuclei with varying concentrations of NaCl. An abrupt increase in chromatin solubility occurred between 100 and 150 mm NaCl (Fig.1, a and b). The amount of MENT retained in chromatin also changed very considerably between these two NaCl concentrations, as shown by Western blotting of nuclear proteins probed with anti-MENT antibodies (Fig.1 c). Granulocyte nuclei washed with 150 and 300 mm NaCl (samples CG-150 and CG-300) retained, respectively, 25 and 1.4% of the original MENT and were used for isolating soluble chicken granulocyte chromatin after limited MNase digestion. Further characterization was carried out on the soluble chromatin fraction S2 (see “Materials and Methods”), which contained about 50–90% of total nuclear DNA. The MENT/DNA ratio was the same in the TEN-washed nuclei as in the soluble chromatin fractions. Depending on the extent of micrococcal nuclease digestion, the average size of nucleosome chains (N av) in S2 preparations varied between 3 and 50 without affecting the protein composition of the solubilized material (data not shown). Since the isolation of granulocyte chromatin required a considerable depletion of MENT, it was important to determine if the residual protein was bound firmly enough to be considered as an integrated architectural element of soluble polynucleosomes. We subjected soluble granulocyte polynucleosomes (CG-150, N av = 20) to ultracentrifugation in 5–25% sucrose gradients containing 50 mm monovalent ions and analyzed the gradient fractions by DNA electrophoresis and Western blotting (Fig.2, a and b). All input MENT cosediments with chromatin (Fig. 2 b), none being found at the top of the gradient. Thus, the behavior of MENT is in sharp contrast to the ubiquitous architectural nonhistone chromatin protein, HMG-1, most of which does not co-sediment with chromatin under these conditions (58Falciola L. Spada F. Galogero S. Langst G. Voit R. Grummt I. Bianchi M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We observed a significant enrichment in MENT (0.84 molecules of MENT/nucleosome) in the fastest sedimenting fraction containing long (>20-mer) polynucleosomes. Small oligonucleosomes contained less MENT, with practically none recovered from the mononucleosome fraction. As discussed below, the distribution of MENT is consistent with the greater compaction of long polynucleosomes (Fig.3, a–f). The low level of MENT in short oligonucleosomes appears to reflect their origin in less condensed “euchromatin” rather than their inability to bind the protein; when we ran a sucrose gradient of a granulocyte chromatin sample from the same nuclei (CG-150) but obtained after extensive cleavage by MNase (N av = 3), MENT was abundant in both the oligonucleosome and mononucleosome fractions, and again no free protein was detected (data not shown). Therefore, the most likely explanation for the preferential association of MENT with long polynucleosomes is that this fraction originated from heterochromatic nuclear domains relatively protected from nuclease digestion (MENT inhibits MNase digestion and is unevenly distributed in granulocyte nuclei, being preferentially associated with compact heterochromatic areas (46Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)). As the heterochromatin becomes more extensively digested, MENT then appears in the oligonucleosome and mononucleosome fractions. To determine whether any other proteins besides MENT are associated with compact granulocyte chromatin, we analyzed the protein composition of nuclear and soluble chromatin released after the 150 mmNaCl treatment (Fig. 2 c, lanes 1 and2) and after sedimentation of oligonucleosomes (N av = 3) through a sucrose gradient (lane 3). Densitometry of the Coomassie-stained gel shows that soluble CG-150 chromatin (lane 2) retains 26% of the MENT present in untreated granulocyte nuclei (lane 1), which, from the previous estimation of 2.1 MENT molecules/nucleosome in granulocytes (46Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), indicates that about 0.5 molecules of MENT/nucleosome are associated with total soluble chromatin. After centrifugation, MENT remains the only prominent band among the nonhistone proteins (Fig. 2 c,lane 3). All other abundant nonhistone proteins such as actin and Mim-1 present in the crude nuclear preparation (46Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol.

The activity of androgens is mediated by an androgen receptor (AR), which binds to specific DNA recognition sites and regulates transcription. We describe here the isolation of two distinct rainbow trout cDNA clones, designated rtAR-α and rtAR-β, which contain the entire androgen receptor coding region. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of rtAR-α to that of rtAR-β revealed 85% identity. Interestingly, despite this high homology, rtAR-α activated transcription of an androgen-responsive reporter gene in co-transfection assays, but rtAR-β did not. These results suggest that rainbow trout contains two distinct isoforms of androgen receptors whose functions differ. The region of rtAR-β responsible for its inactivity was mapped to its ligand binding domain by analyzing chimeras of the rtAR-α, rtAR-β, and rtGR-I (glucocorticoid) receptors.

The androgen receptor (AR)1 is a critical mediator of male sexual differentiation and development in both fish and mammals. Structurally and functionally, the AR belongs to the superfamily of ligand-responsive transcription modifiers, which encompasses the receptors for the steroid and thyroid hormones. Like other nuclear receptors, steroid receptors are composed of three major functional domains: an NH2-terminal hypervariable transcriptional activation domain (TAD), a central highly conserved DNA binding domain (DBD) consisting of two Cys-Cys zinc finger motifs, and a COOH-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) (6Chang C.

It has been reported that the AR regulates androgen target genes by binding to a specific DNA sequence, the androgen-responsive element (ARE; consensus = 5′-GGTACANNNTGTTCT), which is similar to the glucocorticoid response element (12Scheidereit C. Westphal H.M. Carlson C. Bosshard H. Beato M. DNA (N . Y .). 1986; 5: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Strahle U. Klock G. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The AR can either up- or down-regulate the expression of androgen target genes, the outcome probably depending on interactions with specific adapters or co-activators (10Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 11Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4948-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). At present, complete AR cDNAs have been cloned only from mammalian species (human, rat, and mouse) (6Chang C. Kokontis J. Liao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7211-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 15Faber P.W. King A. van Rooij H.C.J. Brinkmann A.O. de Both N.J. Trapman J. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have undertaken the isolation of the rainbow trout homologue of the androgen receptor in order to study its potential role in salmonid fish sexual differentiation, development, and general physiology and to further explore structure-function relationships through sequence comparisons. We report that there are two isoforms of AR mRNA in rainbow trout. These two isoforms, which were present in all tissues examined, encode 96.1- and 95.8-kDa proteins that are highly homologous to mammalian AR. Surprisingly, when the biological activities of the two isoforms were examined in a fish cell line using a transient expression assay, the 96.1-kDa protein was highly active, while the 95.8-kDa AR was inactive. In order to isolate the rainbow trout androgen receptor cDNA, a probe was first generated by PCR. Oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the amino acid sequence of the highly central conserved region of the AR and then used to amplify rainbow trout testis cDNA as described previously (16Yamada S. Hata J. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24361-24366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Products of the expected size were subcloned into the pSK vector (Stratagene) and sequenced. The primers, which yielded a 569-bp fragment highly homologous to human were as follows: primer 1, TA(T/C)TG(T/C)AA(A/G)AA(T/C)GG(A/G/C/T)GG (A/G/C/T)TT(T/C)TT; primer 2, CAT(A/G/C/T)GG(A/G/C/T)A(A/G)(A/G)AA(A/G/C/T)A(A/G)(A/G/T)AT(A/G/C/T)GC(T/C)TT(T/C)TG. A rainbow trout testis random hexanucleotide primed cDNA library in λZapII (Stratagene) was screened by hybridization with a probe made from the cloned PCR fragment. Positive clones were rescued as pBluescript plasmids by in vivo excision and sequenced. Two independent clones, pAR-α and pAR-β, were isolated. Reverse transcriptase PCR was conducted as described previously (17Hata J. Takeo J. Segawa C. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7285-7289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, poly(A)-selected RNA was prepared from various rainbow trout tissues. The cDNAs were synthesized from 100 ng of poly(A) selected RNA using a first strand synthesis kit (Stratagene). An aliquot of the first strand reaction was then subjected to PCR analysis using rtAR-α specific primers α-1 (GGACATCCATGCACAGATA) and α-2 (CATGTGCTGGGGGTT) (which generated a 225-bp product) or rtAR-β-specific primers β-1 (ACAATATGGACCGAGGCA) and β-2 (ATGGGCAGTTCTTCCTTCTC) (which generated a 451-bp product). The pARE3TK-CAT reporter plasmid, which carries three androgen-responsive elements in front of a TK (thymidine kinase) promoter, was a kind gift of Dr. J. Trapman (18Riegman P.H.J. Vlietstra R.J. van der Korput J.A.G.M. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 5: 1921-1930Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The pMSG-CAT reporter plasmid, which carries the MMTV (mouse mammary tumor virus) promoter, was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. To construct the expression vectors, plasmids pAR-α and pAR-β were amplified by PCR using a sense primer homologous to the NH2-terminal end of the coding sequence and an antisense primer homologous to the COOH-terminal end. In addition, the coding sequences in each primer were flanked by EcoRI orHindIII sites for the rtAR-α and rtAR-β sequences, respectively. The resultant products were cleaved with EcoRI or HindIII to yield fragments of 2577 bp (rtAR-α) or 2574 bp (rtAR-β) and then subcloned into EcoRI- orHindIII-digested pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) to yield pSK-rtAR-α and pSK-rtAR-β, respectively. Following verification of their sequences, the EcoRI andHindIII fragments were excised and subcloned intoEcoRI or HindIII digested pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to yield pCMV-rtAR-α and pCMV-rtAR-β, respectively. To facilitate construction of chimeric receptors, plasmids were first made in which the TAD, DBD, or LBD could be separately excised by flanking the DBD withApaI and XbaI sites using site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (19Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar, 20Yamashita S. Hisatake K. Kokubo T. Doi K. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Nakatani Y. Science. 1993; 261: 463-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA was prepared from pSK-rtAR-α, pSK-rtAR-β, and pSK-rtGR-I (21Takeo J. Hata J.-I. Segawa C. Toyohara H. Yamashita S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) for mutagenesis, and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The positions at which these sites were introduced and the resultant plasmids were as follows: at amino acids 495 and 562 for rtAR-α, yielding pSK-AX/rtAR-α; at amino acids 494 and 561 for rtAR-β, yielding pSK-AX/rtAR-β; and at amino acids 420 and 485 for rtGR-I (21Takeo J. Hata J.-I. Segawa C. Toyohara H. Yamashita S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), yielding pSK-AX/rtGR-I. Chimeras were then constructed by subcloning combinations of fragments from these three plasmids into appropriately digested pcDNA3 as follows: pCMV-AβAβG contains the 1683-bp EcoRI/XbaI fragment from pSK-AX/rtAR-β and the 813-bp XbaI/EcoRI fragment from pSK-AX/rtGR-I; pCMV-AβGG contains the 1482-bpEcoRI/ApaI fragment from pSK-AX/rtAR-β and the 1008-bp ApaI/EcoRI fragment from pSK-AX/rtGR-I; pCMV-GAβAβ contains the 1077-bp ApaI/EcoRI fragment from pSK-AX/rtAR-β and and the 1260-bpEcoRI/ApaI fragment from pSK-AX/rtGR-I; pCMV-GGAβ contains the 876-bp XbaI/EcoRI: fragment from pSK-AX/rtAR-β and the 1455-bpEcoRI/XbaI fragment from pSK-AX/rtGR-I; and pCMV-AβAβAα contains the 1683-bpEcoRI/XbaI: fragment from pSK-AX/rtAR-β and the 813-bp XbaI/HindIII fragment from pSK-AX/rtAR-α. Constructs chimeric for subregions of the LBD were created by using PCR methodology, and all chimeric constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The LBD of rtAR-β was divided into four segments, corresponding to amino acid positions 561–630, 631–712, 713–784, and 785–853, carrying 7, 5, 4, and 5 amino acid substitutions, respectively, when compared with rtAR-α. Plasmids pCMV-AR-αβββ, pCMV-AR-βαββ, pCMV-AR-ββαβ, and pCMV-AR-βββα were then constructed by replacing segment I, II, III, or IV of rtAR-β with the corresponding segment of rtAR-α, respectively (Fig. 6). Details of plasmid constructions are available on request. EPC cells (22Fijan N. Sulimanovic D. Bearzotti M. Muzinic D. Zwillenberg L.O. Chilmonczyk S. Vautherot J.F. Kinkelin P. Ann. Virol. 1983; 134: 207-220Google Scholar), derived from carp, were cultured at 27 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. A mixture of the indicated amounts of each receptor plasmid and 2 μg of reporter plasmid (pARE3TK-CAT or pMSG-CAT) was co-transfected into subconfluent cultures of EPC cells in each well of a six-well plate (Corning) using the calcium phosphate method (16Yamada S. Hata J. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24361-24366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CAT assays were performed as described previously (21Takeo J. Hata J.-I. Segawa C. Toyohara H. Yamashita S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal portion of AR-α (amino acids 1–200, Fig. 1 A) was expressed as a histidine fusion protein in Escherichia coli, purified by nickel-agarose (23Yamashita S. Wada K. Horikoshi M. Gong D.W. Kokubo T. Hisatake K. Yokotani N. Malik S. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2839-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and used to immunize rabbits. The specificity of the antibody was examined by immunoblot analysis. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (17Hata J. Takeo J. Segawa C. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7285-7289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were plated at 3 × 106 cells/150-cm2 flask and were transfected with 24 μg of each expression plasmid. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of TEGM buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmmercaptoethanol, 10 mm sodium molybdate, pH 7.2). The suspension was homogenized and then sonicated on ice and centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was used to perform binding assays using the method described by Tilley et al. (24Tilley W.D. Marcelli M. Wilson J.D. McPhaul M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1989; 86: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), except that we used [3H]mibolerone instead of [3H]dihydrotestosterone. The K d(dissociation constant) and B max were calculated by nonlinear regression of specific binding data (Graphpad Prism, San Diego, CA). COS-1 cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well on two-well chamber slides and were transfected with 2 μg of rtAR-α expression plasmid or rtAR-β expression plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, MT was added to 10−7m, and after another 24 h the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldhyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Immunocytochemical staining was performed as described previously (25Hata J.-I. Takeo J. Yamashita S. Fish. Sci. (Tokyo). 1997; 63: 1050-1061Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), except that Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used for visualization. As a first step in isolating the rainbow trout AR cDNA clone, we designed a set of degenerate oligonucleotide primers homologous to an amino acid sequence that is highly conserved between the human and mouse AR. These primers were then used to generate PCR fragments from rainbow trout testis cDNA to isolate a fragment that would serve as a screening probe. A PCR product of the length predicted from the human AR gene was isolated, cloned, and sequenced. The sequence encoded 190 amino acids that had 70% identity with the corresponding region of the human AR. Using a probe generated from this fragment, approximately 1 × 106 plaques from a rainbow trout testis cDNA library were screened, and several strongly hybridizing clones were obtained and sequenced. The sequences obtained revealed two different AR homologues, designated rtAR-α, and rtAR-β (accession numbers for nucleotide sequences are AB012095 for rtAR-α and AB012096 for rtAR-β). Both sequences contain an ATG initiation codon followed by an extended open reading frame; the rtAR-α cDNA encodes an 854 amino acid protein of a molecular mass of 96.1 kDa, and the rtAR-β cDNA encodes an 853-amino acid protein of a molecular mass of 95.8 kDa (Fig.1, A and B, respectively). Both of the encoded proteins contain all of the domains that characterize the steroid hormone receptor family, including a striking canonical leucine zipper structure in the COOH-terminal LBD. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the rtAR-α with that of rtAR-β reveals 85% identity with continuity. Comparison of the three different functional domains of the rtAR-α to those of rtAR-β shows a homology of 79% for the TAD (amino acids 1–495), 97% for the DBA (amino acids 496–562), and 93% for the LBD (amino acids 563–854) (Fig. 2). The observation that differences occur throughout the coding regions indicates that these two predicted proteins arise from different genes rather than by alternative splicing. However, since the testis cDNA library used to isolate the clones was constructed from pooled RNA from several fishes, it was also possible that they are encoded by two different alleles in the population. To test this, PCR fragments spanning the NH2-terminal portion of the two cDNAs were amplified and sequenced from one rainbow trout testis and ovary. The presence of the two isoforms were confirmed in each case (data not shown). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of rtAR-α and rtAR-β with that of the mouse and human ARs is shown in Fig. 2. The amino acid sequence of the DBD of rtAR-α and rtAR-β shows 92 and 95% identity with that of human AR (the DBD of human AR is identical to that of mouse AR). Similarly, the amino acid sequence of the LBD of rtAR-α and rtAR-β shows 65 and 68% identity with that of human AR (the LBD of human AR is 97% identical to that of mouse AR). Thus, both the DNA binding and ligand binding domains are highly conserved. On the other hand, the NH2-terminal TAD shows less sequence similarity than does the COOH-terminal portion (only 19% sequence identity between rtAR-α/rtAR-β and the human AR). We used the highly sensitive RT-PCR technique to survey the tissue distribution of rtAR-α and rtAR-β mRNA in rainbow trout. The PCR primers used were targeted to non-homologous segments of the two sequences so that the presence of each transcript could be evaluated (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and2). Both rtAR-α and rtAR-β mRNA expression could be detected in all tissues tested (Fig. 3). No amplification was seen when the AMV reverse transcriptase was omitted from the cDNA synthesis reaction (data not shown). To determine the biological activities of rtAR-α and rtAR-β, cells were co-transfected with an rtAR expression vector and an androgen-responsive reporter gene. The expression vectors were made by inserting the rtAR-α and rtAR-β cDNAs into a CMV expression vector to yield pCMV-rtAR-α and pCMV-rtAR-β. For the reporter gene we used pMSG-CAT, which carries the MMTV promoter driving expression of the bacterial CAT reporter gene (Fig.4 A). Although the expression of many genes is known to be androgen dependent, only a few have been shown to be directly regulated by androgen, and the MMTV promoter is the best studied among these (14Ham J. Thomson A. Needham M. Webb P. Parker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5263-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The MMTV promoter is regulated by glucocorticoids and progestins, but is also able to confer androgen responsiveness to a reporter gene, although less efficiently. As it has been shown that the level of androgen inducibility in a transient transfection assay is dependent on the cell type used, we first screened several fish cell lines by co-transfection with the pMSG-CAT reporter plasmid and either the pCMV-rtAR-α or pCMV-rtAR-β expression plasmid. As a result of this screening, we selected the EPC cell line derived from carp (22Fijan N. Sulimanovic D. Bearzotti M. Muzinic D. Zwillenberg L.O. Chilmonczyk S. Vautherot J.F. Kinkelin P. Ann. Virol. 1983; 134: 207-220Google Scholar). Transfection of the pMSG-CAT reporter plasmid into the EPC cell line produced very low basal expression of CAT, and it was not induced by MT (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, upon co-transfection of the pMSG-CAT reporter plasmid and the rtAR-α expression plasmid, MT stimulated the level of CAT protein expression about 5-fold (Fig. 4 B). Surprisingly, co-transfection of pMSG-CAT and pCMV-rtAR-β yielded no significant transactivation (Fig.4 B). To further test the activities of rtAR-α and rtAR-β, we used another reporter plasmid, pARE3TK-CAT, which carries three androgen responsive elements derived from the prostate-specific antigen promoter (15Faber P.W. King A. van Rooij H.C.J. Brinkmann A.O. de Both N.J. Trapman J. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) just upstream of the TK basal promoter (Fig. 4 A). The results obtained were similar to those using the pMSG-CAT reporter plasmid; the CAT expression levels produced by pARE3TK-CAT were low in either the absence or presence of MT, but were significantly enhanced (about 7-fold) in the presence of MT upon co-transfection with pCMV-rtAR-α but not with pCMV-rtAR-β (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that the rtAR-α is capable of producing a fully functional receptor that mediates hormone-dependent transcriptional activation, whereas the highly homologous rtAR-β is inactive. When EPC cells were co-transfected with pCMV-rtAR-α and pARE3TK-CAT in the presence of the other steroids (dexamethasone, aldosterone, progesterone, and 17β-estradiol), CAT expression was not induced (data not shown). When we also used the co-transfection assay to examine the response of the rtAR-β to the same set of steroids including MT, no induction was observed with any of them (data not shown). To map the region(s) of rtAR-β that renders it inactive, a series of chimeric expression plasmids was constructed that carry various combinations of the TAD, DBD, and LBD regions from rtAR-β, rtAR-α, or the rainbow trout GR-I (21Takeo J. Hata J.-I. Segawa C. Toyohara H. Yamashita S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To facilitate construction of the chimeric plasmids, we flanked the DNA binding domains of each receptor withApaI and XbaI restriction sites. The chimeric constructs produced are illustrated in Fig.5. These chimeric plasmids were transiently co-transfected with pARE3TK-CAT into EPC cells in the presence or absence of MT or dexamethasone. Co-transfection of pCMV-rtGR-I into EPC cells results in strong dexamethasone-dependent CAT expression from the pARE3TK-CAT reporter plasmid (Fig. 5), indicating that the DBD of rtGR could functionally recognize the androgen-responsive element. The results from the various chimeric constructs suggest that the inactivity of the rtAR-β is due to its LBD; for example, a chimera composed of the rtGR TAD and DBD and the rtAR-β LBD is inactive, whereas one composed of the rtAR-β TAD and DBD and a LBD from either the rtGR or rtAR-α is highly active (Fig. 5). The activity of the latter chimera, pCMV-AβAβAα, is in fact about 2-fold greater than that of pCMV-rtAR-α. To further localize the region of rtAR-β responsible for its inactivity, we subdivided its LBD into four segments and made constructs in which each was individually replaced with the corresponding segment from rtAR-α (Fig.6). The four segments extended from amino acids 562–630, 631–712, 713–784, and 785–853 and contained 7, 5, 4, and 5 amino acid differences between the isoforms, respectively. The results of transfections using the rtAR-α/β chimera constructs, expressed in fold induction by MT, are shown in Fig. 6. Surprisingly, three of the four chimeric constructs supported a dramatic MT-regulated response, similar to that seen with pCMV-rtAR-α. Thus the inability of rtAR-β to activate transcription depends on the simultaneous presence of sequences distributed throughout the LBD. Since the inability of rtAR-β to activate transcription resides in its LBD, we next examined the ligand binding abilities of the rtAR-α, rtAR-β, and chimeric rtARs. A high level of [3H]mibolerone binding was observed in extracts prepared from cells transfected with pCMV-rtAR-α or the active chimeric expression plasmids pCMV-AR-AβAβAα, -αβββ, -βαββ, and -βββα (Fig.7). However, when cells were transfected with the pCMV vector as a negative control, or with the inactive chimeras pCMV-rtAR-β and pCMV-AR-ββαβ, specific [3H]mibolerone binding was absent (Fig. 7). The complete correlation between mibolerone binding and transcriptional activation strongly suggests that the inability of rtAR-β to transactivate is due to its poor ligand binding affinity. Next, we performed an analysis of [3H]mibolerone binding in cytosol fractions derived from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with pCMV-rtAR-α. Saturation ligand binding analysis and Scatchard analysis revealed a K d of 0.16 nm andB max of 178 fmol/mg of protein (data not shown). These values are similar to those of the human AR (K d = 0.5 nm andB max = 357 fmol/mg protein) (24Tilley W.D. Marcelli M. Wilson J.D. McPhaul M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1989; 86: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). If rtAR-β binds androgens poorly in vivo, it might remain in the cytoplasm in the presence of MT, whereas the rtAR-α would translocate to the nucleus. This possibility was tested by analyzing transfected COS-1 cells by fluorescent immunocytochemistry, using an antibody raised against bacterially expressed rtAR-α protein (NH2-terminal 200 amino acids; see “Experimental Procedures”). This antibody was shown by immunoblot analysis of transfected cell lysates from COS-1 cells to specifically detect both the rtAR-α and the rtAR-β proteins (data not shown). Only low background staining was observed if cells were transfected with pCMV lacking an AR sequence (Fig.8 A), and no staining was observed following transfection of any of the expression plasmids when preimmune antisera was used (data not shown). In the presence of MT, the AR-α showed strong nuclear staining, whereas a striking cytoplasmic distribution was observed for AR-β (Fig. 8, Band C). The remaining chimeric expression plasmids (see Fig.7) were also examined for their nuclear translocation ability. Only the AR-ββαβ protein showed cytoplasmic staining in the presence of MT (data not shown). Thus, the inability of rtAR-β to mediate transactivation correlated with failure to be translocated to the nucleus. The function of steroid hormones in the development and sexual differentiation of fish has been well documented at the physiological and endocrinological levels. At the molecular level, both the estrogen receptor and glucocorticoid receptor have been cloned and characterized from various fish species, but sequence information for the AR has not been available. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of androgen action in the early stage of sexual differentiation and spermatogenesis, we isolated AR cDNA clones from rainbow trout testis. By using PCR to generate a homologous probe, we isolated two distinct isoforms of rainbow trout AR cDNA clones that contain the entire coding sequence for the protein. Both encoded protein sequences are highly homologous to that of other species, especially in their COOH-terminal halves. Because this region includes the DNA binding domain, it is not unexpected that the DBD of both rtAR-α and rtAR-β could recognize the human AR response element (for rtAR-β based on activity of LBD chimeras; e.g. pCMV-AβAβG in Fig. 6). Homology between the human AR and rtAR-α is less strong at the NH2-terminal half (19% identical) than at the COOH-terminal half (DBD, 92% identical; LBD, 64% identical). The lower homology in the NH2-terminal half could be significant for regulation of gene activity, as this segment contains the region involved in transcriptional activation. Precedence for isoforms of a sex steroid receptor was set recently by the discovery of a second estrogen receptor, ER-β (26Kuiper G.G.M.J. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4224) Google Scholar, 27Mosselman S. Polman J. Dijkema R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). ER-β shares many functional similarities with the classic estrogen receptor, ER-α, including substrate and antagonist binding affinities. However, there are differences in their tissue localization and in the mechanisms regulating their transcriptional activities. In the case of the AR, all data suggest that there is only a single gene in human (28Chang C. Saltzman A. Yeh S. Young W. Keller E. Lee H.-J. Wang C. Mizokami A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 97-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In contrast, our results demonstrate the existence of two distinct isoforms of ARs in rainbow trout. Interestingly, despite their highly similar amino acid sequences, one is active in our transient assay, and the other is not (Fig. 4). Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the inactivity of rtAR-β in our assays is due to the sequence of its LBD. Interchanging the rtAR-α or GR-I LBD for that of rtAR-β in chimeric proteins produced an active receptor; and surprisingly, even replacement by the corresponding rtAR-α segment of any one of three out of four subregions of the LBD was sufficient to produce activity. Consistent with this protein mapping data, ligand binding assays using cell extracts from transfected COS-1 cells revealed that rtAR-α bound [3H]mibolerone with an affinity comparable with that of the human AR, whereas no binding could be detected with rtAR-β (Fig.7). An absence of ligand binding by rtAR-β in vivo was indicated by its failure to translocate to the nucleus when transfected COS-1 cells were treated with MT (Fig. 8). Furthermore, tests of the various chimeric constructs show a perfect correlation between transcriptional activation, ligand binding, and nuclear translocation. Thus, all our data indicate that the rtAR-β is inactive in the transient assay due to a lack of ligand binding. The rtAR-α that we have isolated presumably mediates the androgen responses in the rainbow trout. The function of the rtAR-β, however, is unclear. We consider four possibilities. One is that the rtAR-β gene is a duplication of the rtAR-α that has devolved to nonfunctionality. This seems quite unlikely, however, as none of the 130 amino acid changes has resulted in introduction of a nonsense codon, an unlikely probability (less than 0.5%) if rtAR-β has no function. A second possibility is that rtAR-β is indeed inactive, but serves to modulate the activity of rtAR-α by forming a heterodimer. However, in preliminary experiments we have found no effect of co-transfection of the rtAR-β expression vector on the activity produced by rtAR-α. Generation of antibodies specific for either rtAR-α or rtAR-β, now under way, will permit assay for heterodimers in extracts of fish tissues. A third possibility is that the rtAR-β requires an accessory factor for hormone binding that is not present in either the EPC or COS-1 cells that we have used. The alteration in rtAR-β that prevents binding is apparently quite subtle, as replacements of small subsections of the LBD with the corresponding rtAR-α sequence restores activity. In fact, as the result of an inadvertent PCR-induced mutation we found that activity was restored by substitution of the glutamine at position 646 with an arginine (data not shown). The tenuousness of the binding deficit suggests it might be readily reversed by association of the rtAR-β with an accessory factor. On the other hand, whereas there is ample precedent for accessory proteins affecting the transcriptional potency of hormone receptors (10Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 11Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4948-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), there is none for affecting ligand binding. Finally, it is possible that the ligand for rtAR-β differs from those that we have tested (methyltestosterone, dexamethasone, aldosterone, progesterone, and 17β-estradiol), perhaps being unique to fish. The antibody specific for rtAR-β that we are in the process of preparing should also be useful for examining this question, by determining if rtAR-β appears in the nucleus of fish cells. In summary, the molecular cloning of the fish AR cDNAs described here identifies AR proteins that will be important for determining the mechanism of sex determination in fish. In addition, these proteins will be useful for comparative, structure-function analyses of mammalian ARs. Finally, the discovery of a highly homologous AR isoform, rtAR-β, which is inactive in the conventional assays we have used, raises the possibility of a novel function for a hormone receptor.

Brenner (NINDS, National Institutes of Health) for a critical reading of this manuscript, Dr. Trapman J. for providing a pARE3TK-CAT reporter plasmid, and Segawa C. for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1966071013,"Fibronectin (FN) is comprised of multiple isoforms arising from alternative splicing of a single gene transcript. One of the alternatively spliced segments, EDA, is expressed prominently in embryonic development, malignant transformation, and wound healing. We showed previously that EDA+ FN was more potent than EDA− FN in promoting cell spreading and cell migration because of its enhanced binding affinity to integrin α5β1 (Manabe, R., Oh-e, N., Maeda, T., Fukuda, T., and Sekiguchi, K. (1997) J. Cell Biol. 139, 295–307). In this study, we compared the cell cycle progression and its associated signal transduction events induced by FN isoforms with or without the EDA segment to examine whether the EDA segment modulates the cell proliferative potential of FN. We found that EDA+ FN was more potent than EDA− FN in inducing G1-S phase transition. Inclusion of the EDA segment potentiated the ability of FN to induce expression of cyclin D1, hyperphosphorylation of pRb, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal regulated kinase 2 (ERK2). EDA+ FN was also more potent than EDA− FN in promoting FN-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, but not focal adhesion kinase, which occurred in parallel with the activation of ERK2, suggesting that p130Cas may be involved in activation of ERK2. These results indicated that alternative splicing at the EDA region is a novel mechanism that promotes FN-induced cell cycle progression through up-regulation of integrin-mediated mitogenic signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2025827931,"Collagen-related peptide (CRP), a collagen homologue, induces platelet activation through a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway, leading to sequential tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc receptor (FcR) γ-chain, Syk, and phospholipase C-γ2. Here we report that CRP and the platelet low affinity immune receptor FcγRIIA stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the T cell adapter SLP-76, whereas the G protein-coupled receptor agonist thrombin induces only minor tyrosine phosphorylation. This suggests that SLP-76 has a specific role downstream of receptors that signal via an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate association of SLP-76 with SLAP-130, Vav, Fyn, Lyn, and the FcR γ-chain in CRP-stimulated platelets. Several of these proteins, including SLP-76, undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in in vitro kinase assays performed on SLP-76 immunoprecipitates. Tyrosine phosphorylation of all of these proteins in the in vitro kinase assay was abrogated by the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1, suggesting that it is mediated by either Fyn or Lyn. The physiological significance of this is uncertain, however, since tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76in vivo is not altered in either Fyn- or Lyn-deficient platelets. CRP stimulation of Syk-deficient platelets demonstrated thatin vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 is downstream of Syk. The absence of Syk in the SLP-76 immunoprecipitates raises the possibility that another protein is responsible for bringing SLP-76 to Syk. Candidates for this include those proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with SLP-76, including the FcR γ-chain. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2 and Ca2+mobilization is markedly attenuated in SLP-76-deficient platelets following CRP stimulation, suggesting that the adapter plays a critical role in the regulation of the phospholipase. The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of SLAP-130 in response to CRP is also inhibited in SLP-76-deficient platelets, placing it downstream of SLP-76. This work identifies SLP-76 as an important adapter molecule that is regulated by Syk and lies upstream of SLAP-130 and PLC-γ2 in CRP-stimulated platelets.

Src homology 2 collagen-related peptide gluthationeS-transferase Fc receptor phospholipase C-γ T cell receptor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis monoclonal antibody polyvinylidene difluoride glycoprotein VI SLP-76 (SH21domain-containing leukocyte protein of76 kDa) was identified by association with the SH3 domain of the Grb2 adapter protein in T cells and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation (1Jackman J.K.

SLP-76 has three potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites within its amino terminus region: Tyr113, Tyr128, and Tyr145.

More recently, lack of expression of SLP-76 in Jurkat cells demonstrated that SLP-76 is necessary for tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) and activation of the Ras pathway (11Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Moreover, SLP-76 is required for normal thymocyte development, since SLP-76 knock-out mice lack peripheral T cells (12Clements J.L. Yang B. Ross-Barta S.E. Eliason S.L. Hrstka R.F. Williamson R.A.

We have previously reported the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated SLP-76 with the SH3 domain of Grb2 in platelets in response to stimulation of the low affinity IgG immunoreceptor FcγRIIA (15Robinson A.

Increasing evidence suggests that the collagen receptor underlying the major increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets also signals like an immune receptor. The collagen receptor is believed to comprise a multimeric structure, containing the glycoprotein VI (GPVI), and the Fc receptor (FcR) γ-chain (16Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R. Barnes M. Law C.-L.

SLP-76 was recently reported to be a crucial adapter protein in collagen-stimulated platelets, since aggregation and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2 in response to collagen is abolished in SLP-76-deficient platelets. 2Clements, J.

Stimulation and measurements were performed at 37 °C. Cytosolic Ca2+ levels were measured as described previously (31Rodrı́guez-Liñares B. Watson S.P. Biochem.

The experimentally determined value of K used in this study is 3.6 μm. We have previously reported that FcγRIIA cross-linking stimulates marked tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 in human platelets (15Robinson A. Gibbins J. Rodrı́guez-Liñares B. Finan P.M. Wilson L. Kellie S. Findell P. Watson S.P. Blood. 1996; 88: 522-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a result that is confirmed in the present study (Fig.1 A). Collagen was also observed to stimulate marked tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76, in agreement with the observation in mouse platelets,2 whereas the G protein-coupled receptor agonist thrombin induced only a low level of tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 (Fig. 1 A). CRP, a synthetic peptide based on the triple-helical structure of collagen, also stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 (Fig.1 A). Reprobing the membrane for SLP-76 to check loading revealed that the anti-SLP-76 antibody has a better affinity for the unphosphorylated form of SLP-76 (Fig. 1 A). Further studies were performed with CRP, since this is a powerful agonist for GPVI but is unable to bind to α2β1 (23Morton L.F. Hargreave P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem.

The time course showing tyrosine phosphorylation of total platelet protein indicated that a major band of 75 kDa displayed the same tyrosine phosphorylation pattern as SLP-76 (not shown). SLP-76 was identified as a component of this band. We have previously shown that Syk is also a component of this band. Pretreatment of platelets with the Ca2+ chelator bis(O-aminophenoxy)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid and the protein kinase C antagonist Ro 31-8220 to inhibit the action of the second messengers produced by PLC-γ2indicated that tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 is independent of PLC-γ2 activation (Fig. 1 A). SLP-76 co-immunoprecipitated with a tyrosine phosphoprotein of 130 kDa following stimulation by CRP, collagen, and thrombin (Fig. 1 A). Cross-linking of FcγRIIA only induces a small increase in phosphorylation of this 130-kDa phosphoprotein. SLAP-130, which associates with the SH2 domain of SLP-76 following TCR engagement (8Musci M.A. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Paskind M. Kamens J. Turck C.W. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11674-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and PLC-γ2, the only PLC-γ isoform to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in CRP and collagen-stimulated platelets (24Asselin J.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), have a similar electrophoretic mobility to this tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 130 kDa. However, subsequent immunoblotting with SLAP-130- or PLC-γ2-specific antibodies failed to identify conclusively the 130-kDa co-precipitated protein, possibly because the level of protein was below that of the sensitivity of detection. The presence of SLAP-130 in the 130-kDa band was subsequently shown by sequential immunoprecipitations as described below. Immunoprecipitation of SLP-76 using an antibody covalently linked to Protein A-Sepharose revealed the presence of a tyrosine-phosphorylated band of approximately 55 kDa (Fig. 1 C) that was sometimes resolved as a doublet. This band was hidden by the IgG heavy chain band under standard immunoprecipitation conditions. The 55-kDa band was present in resting platelets, and its level of tyrosine phosphorylation increased with stimulation of platelets by CRP. It was identified as the tyrosine kinase Lyn by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 C). There was a small increase in association with SLP-76 following CRP stimulation, although this was less than the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. Immunoblotting for Grb2 revealed the presence of a similar level of the adapter protein co-immunoprecipitating with SLP-76 in resting and CRP-stimulated platelets (not shown). This is likely to be mediated through the SH3 domain of Grb2 as previously shown in FcγRIIA-stimulated platelets (15Robinson A. Gibbins J. Rodrı́guez-Liñares B. Finan P.M. Wilson L. Kellie S. Findell P. Watson S.P. Blood. 1996; 88: 522-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used a fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of SLP-76, GST-SLP-SH2, to locate the binding site of Lyn and the component(s) of the 130-kDa protein. GST alone, used as control, did not bind any tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig.2). GST-SLP-SH2 precipitates two major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 55 and 130 kDa (Fig. 2) in resting platelets. Stimulation of platelets by CRP strongly increased the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of 130-kDa protein that is precipitated by GST-SLP-SH2, whereas the level of phosphorylation of the 55-kDa protein underwent a small increase. Reprobing revealed Lyn and SLAP-130 as components of these bands, respectively (Fig. 2). There was a small increase in the association of Lyn and SLAP-130 in CRP-stimulated lanes (Fig. 2). Association of SLAP-130 to SLP-76 under basal conditions was also reported in T cells (8Musci M.A. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Paskind M. Kamens J. Turck C.W. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11674-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Minor tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 90 and 75 kDa were also associated with GST-SLP-SH2 in CRP-stimulated platelets. The 75-kDa band was not identified as Syk or Btk by immunoblotting, although either or both may be below the detection sensitivity of the antibodies. Comparison of autoradiographs of kinase assays of immunoprecipitated SLP-76 before and after KOH treatment indicated the absence of serine/threonine kinase co-immunoprecipitating with SLP-76 in resting and CRP-stimulated platelets (not shown). Three major bands of 130, 75, and 55 were phosphorylated in SLP-76 immunoprecipitates from resting platelets (Fig.3 A). The three bands of 130, 75, and 55 kDa correspond to the major tyrosine-phosphorylated bands observed in SLP-76 immunoprecipitates when immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine (Fig. 3 A). The level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the 130-, 75-, and 55-kDa bands increased dramatically in SLP-76 immunoprecipitates from CRP-stimulated platelets. CRP stimulation also induced the appearance of three other minor tyrosine-phosphorylated bands of 90, 60, and 38 kDa following kinase assay. On a longer exposure, a doublet of 13/11.5 kDa could also be seen in CRP-stimulated samples (not shown). The 90-kDa band was also seen by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting in Fig. 3 A, while the 60-kDa band could be seen in a longer exposure. The 75-kDa band was identified as SLP-76 by immunoblotting. The remaining proteins were identified through sequential immunoprecipitation. Followingin vitro kinase assay, the proteins co-immunoprecipitating with SLP-76 were dissociated by boiling in the presence of 2% SDS. Supernatant was diluted down to 0.1% SDS, and proteins from the supernatant were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies. Components of the 13/11.5-, 55-, 60-, 90-, and 130-kDa radiolabeled bands were identified as FcR γ-chain (Fig.4 A), Lyn (Fig. 4 B), Fyn (Fig. 4 C), Vav (Fig. 4 D), and SLAP-130 (Fig.4 E), respectively. A more prominent association with Fyn was seen in some studies as illustrated in Fig.5. The weak band corresponding to Vav is likely to reflect both a low level of binding and the fact that it serves as a poor substrate in the in vitro kinase assay. Neither Syk nor PLC-γ2 were detected in these studies, suggesting that they do not associate with SLP-76 or that PLC-γ2 is not a substrate in the in vitrokinase assay.Figure 4FcR γ-chain, Lyn, Fyn, Vav, and SLAP-130 co-immunoprecipitate with SLP-76 following CRP stimulation. SLP-76 was immunoprecipitated as described in the legend of Fig. 3. Following an in vitro kinase assay, immunoprecipitated proteins were parted in lysis buffer containing 2% SDS. Proteins were heated, and subsequently the SDS concentration of the supernatant was reduced to 0.1% by the addition of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Lysates were used for immunoprecipitation of FcR γ-chain (A), Lyn (B), Fyn (C), Vav (D), and SLAP-130 (E). Proteins were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE, expect for FcR γ-chain immunoprecipitation, which was resolved on 10–18% gradient SDS-PAGE. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were dried and exposed to autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Effect of PP1 on in vitrokinase assay performed on SLP-76 immunoprecipitated from resting or CRP-stimulated platelets lysed in Nonidet P-40- or Brij 96-containing buffer. Stimulation of platelets with Tyrode-Hepes buffer or 3 μg/ml CRP was stopped after 90 s by the addition of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer or Brij 96 lysis buffer. SLP-76 was immunoprecipitated and submitted to an in vitro kinase assay. When indicated, kinase assay was performed in the presence of 10 μm PP1. Proteins were resolved on 10–18% gradient SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were treated with 1 m KOH for 1 h at 55 °C and submitted to autoradiography (upper panel). Equal loading was checked by immunoblotting the membranes using the anti-SLP-76 mAb (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A kinase assay was also performed on proteins precipitated with GST-SLP-SH2. This showed a similar profile of kinase activity as SLP-76 immunoprecipitates, except for the presence of a 38-kDa protein, an uncharacterized doublet of 75 kDa and the lack of SLP-76 (Fig.3 B).

Triiodothyronine (T3) induced a ∼3.6-fold increase in the steady-state level of StAR mRNA which paralleled with those of the acute steroid response (∼4.0-fold), as monitored by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay and progesterone production, respectively. The T3-stimulated progesterone production was effectively inhibited by actinomycin-D or cycloheximide, indicating the requirement of on-going mRNA and protein synthesis. T3 displayed the highest affinity of [125I]iodo-T3 binding and was most potent in stimulating StAR mRNA expression. In accordance, T3significantly increased testosterone production in primary cultures of adult mouse Leydig cells. The T3 and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) effects on StAR expression were similar in magnitude and additive. Cells expressing steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) showed marginal elevation of StAR expression, but coordinately increased T3-induced StAR mRNA expression and progesterone levels. In contrast, overexpression of DAX-1 markedly diminished the SF-1 mRNA expression, and concomitantly abolished T3-mediated responses. Noteworthy, T3 augmented the SF-1 mRNA expression while inhibition of the latter by DAX-1 strongly impaired T3 action. Northern hybridization analysis revealed four StAR transcripts which increased 3–6-fold following T3 stimulation.

Conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone is the first enzymatic step in steroidogenesis which is catalyzed by the cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P450 enzyme, located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (3Miller W.L.

It has been demonstrated that luteinizing hormone, its “superagonist” hCG,1 and the analog of their second messenger (cAMP), dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP), cause in MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells increased synthesis of a series of 37-, 32-, and 30-kDa proteins, which are closely associated with mitochondria (7Stocco D.M.

Inhibition of protein synthesis in the hormone-stimulated steroidogenic cells has been shown to decrease their response in steroid biosynthesis. It is known that the inhibitor-sensitive step is present in the mitochondria and that cycloheximide (CHX) has no effect on the activity of cholesterol side chain cleavage complexes or on cholesterol accumulation to the outer mitochondrial membrane (10Simpson E.R.

Hypothyroidism is associated with abnormalities in sexual function, such as azoospermia, oligozoospermia, and loss of libido and impotence in men, whereas in women it causes irregular menstrual bleedings and impaired fertility due to corpus luteum insufficiency (15Gerhard I. Becker T. Eggert-Kruse W. Klinga K. Runnebaum B. Hum. Reprod. 1991; 6: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Oppenheimer et al.(16Oppenheimer J.H. Schwartz H.L. Surks M.I. Endocrinology. 1974; 95: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) first demonstrated the presence of nuclear-binding sites for T3 in the rat testis. It has also been demonstrated that the morphological and functional development of testes is highly dependent on thyroid hormones, especially under regulation of the nuclear T3 receptor (17Palmero S. Prati M. Marco P.D. Trucchi P. Fugassa E. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 136: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Oppenheimer J.H. Oppenheimer J.H. Samuels H.H. Molecular Basis of Thyroid Hormone Action. Academic Press, New York1983: 1-34Crossref Google Scholar). In goat (Capra hircus) Leydig cells, T3 induces a proteinaceous factor, sensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitors actinomycin D or CHX, which is present in the soluble supernatant fractions of 100,000 × g, and is responsible for androgen production (19Jana N.R. Bhattacharya S. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 143: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It was also found that T3 augments the stimulatory effect of leutinizing hormone on androgen secretion. In cultured human luteinized granulosa cells, T3 modulated hCG-induced progesterone secretion, cell proliferation, and cAMP production, whereas it had no effect on medium size follicles (20Goldman S.

Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 2353-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the T3-hCG interaction in mouse Leydig tumor cells have so far remained elusive. Thyroid hormone receptors have also been demonstrated in human granulosa, corpus luteum, and rat granulosa cell nuclei (13Wakim A.N. Polizotto S.L. Buffo M.J. Marrero M.A. Burholt D.R. Fertil.

Immunocytochemical studies with antiserum against the cellular erythroblastosis A/T3 receptor also provide evidence for the presence of T3 receptor protein in the rat tissues (24Tagami T. Nakamura H. Sasaki S. Mori T. Yoshioka H. Yoshida H. Imura H. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These data imply that thyroid hormones are involved in reproduction, and the effects are known to be absolutely dependent on de novoprotein synthesis. However, nothing is still known about the nature of the T3-induced protein(s) in the regulation of steroidogenesis. Recently, an leutinizing hormone-induced 30-kDa mitochondrial factor, named the StAR protein, has been purified and cloned from the MA-10 cells, and it has the necessary properties of inducing steroidogenesis (25Clark B.J. Wells J. King S.R. Stocco D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28314-28322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA clones for StAR have also been isolated from the human, rat, and cow, and they exhibit a high degree of homology (26Sugawara T. Holt J.A. Driscoll D. Strauss III, J.F. Lin D. Miller W.L. Patterson D. Clancy K.P. Har I.M. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4778-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 27Sandhoff T.W. McLean M.P.

The StAR gene is known to encode a 37-kDa nonphosphorylated protein that is processed to a 30-kDa mature form via four intermediates, with half-lives of 3–5 min in the mitochondria (29Clark B.J. Soo S.C. Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,30Epstein L.F. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol.

Northern hybridization analysis revealed the presence of three StAR transcripts in the mouse (3.4, 2.7, and 1.6 kilobases) and human (7.4, 4.4, and 1.6 kilobases), and two in the cow (3.0 and 1.8 kilobases) (25Clark B.J.

Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells, the cAMP-mediated stimulation of steroidogenesis is well correlated with StAR mRNA expression and StAR protein synthesis (29Clark B.J. Soo S.C. Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the potential involvement of thyroid hormones in steroidogenesis, their precise mode of action remain to be determined. The important role of StAR in steroidogenesis prompted us to examine its involvement in the thyroid hormone stimulation, and consequently in the mechanism of action by employing the orphan nuclear receptors SF-1 and DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X-chromosome). Recent studies implicate that SF-1 and DAX-1 play a key role in adrenal and gonadal differentiation, development, and function (31Ikeda Y. Swain A. Weber T.J. Hentges K.E. Zanaria E. Lalli E. Tamai K.T. Sassone-Corsi P. Lovell-Badge R. Camerino G. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1261-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 32Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr.

Impaired adrenal development and function, associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, appear due to mutations of these two nuclear receptors. The complex endocrine phenotypes with the SF-1 and DAX-1 mutations point strongly to their interactions in a hierarchial pathway, and they may activate the target genes in a cooperative fashion (34Lalli E. Bardoni B. Zazopoulos E. Wurtz J.-M. Strom T.M. Moras D. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1950-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Conspicuously, SF-1 knock-out mice completely lack adrenal glands and gonads despite normal embryonic levels of serum corticosterone (35Sadovsky Y. Crawford P.A. Woodson K.G. Polish J.A. Clements M.A. Tourtellotte L.M. Simburger K. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10939-10943Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). It is apparent that understanding the involvement of thyroid hormones into the regulation of steroidogenesis requires exploration of the above two transcription factors. In light of these observations, we found it important to examine the physiological relationship of thyroid hormone action and StAR gene expression during steroidogenesis, using mouse Leydig tumor cells (mLTC-1, Ref. 36Rebois R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) as the experimental model. The current findings demonstrate for the first time that thyroid hormones, through induction of the SF-1-mediated StAR gene expression, play a major role in the regulation of steroidogenesis. The mouse tumor Leydig cells (mLTC-1, see Ref. 36Rebois R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were maintained in HEPES-buffered Waymouth's medium supplemented with 9% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland, United Kingdom) and 4.5% fetal calf serum (Biochlear, Wilts, UK) containing 0.1 g/liter gentamycin (Biological Industries, K. B. Haemek, Israel). The cells were subcultured at a density of 6 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates for determining progesterone (P) production, and at 5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates for total RNA extraction. Transfections were carried out at 65–75% confluency of the cells by using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Boehringer-Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) under optimized conditions according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was diluted in serum-free Waymouth's medium and incubated at room temperature to a final volume of 300 μl. Two μg of pCMV119+-SF-1 construct, obtained from Dr. K. L. Parker (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC), and 2 μg of pBKCMV-hDAX-1 construct, obtained from Dr. R. Yu (Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL), or their combination (1:1), were used for transfections. Two μg of a β-galactosidase expression vector, pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega, Madison, WI) were used as an internal control of tranfection efficiency. FuGENE 6-DNA complex following 15 min incubation at room temperature were distributed dropwise to the plate containing 3 ml of regular medium. Adult mouse (C57 strain, 2–3 months) testicular Leydig cells were prepared as described previously (37Ding Y.-Q. Huhtaniemi I. Acta Endocrinol. 1984; 121: 46-54Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 38El-Gehani F. Tena-Sempere M. Huhtaniemi I. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), modified further for better recovery. Briefly, decapsulated interstitial cells were isolated by collagenase (0.2%, 20 min, 34° C, 95% O2, 5% CO2) dispersion in Dulbecco′s modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 25 mmol/liter Hepes, pH 7.4, 18 mmol/liter sodium bicarbonate, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). After filtration through sterile nylon gauze (mesh 0.5–0.8 mm), collagenase was removed by washing, and cells were purified by a continuous Percoll (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) gradient (density range 1.01–1.126 kg/liter) centrifugation. The cell types partitioned due to the various buoyant densities, and those gathered at the zone approximately to 1.07 kg/liter of Percoll were collected, washed, and the purity of Leydig cells was assessed by histochemical 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase reaction; about 80% were found to be 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase positive cells (39Mendelson C. Dufau M. Catt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were subcultured in growth medium supplemented with 10,000 units/liter penicillin and 50 mg/liter streptomycin, at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates, and stimulated with the indicated substances as described above. Total RNA was isolated from control and stimulated cells by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (40Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). The purity of the extracted RNA was determined by scanning with spectrophotometer at wavelength 220–320 nm. The isolation and amplification of the mouse (mLTC-1) StAR cDNA were carried out by engineering primers from the mouse StAR cDNA sequence (25Clark B.J. Wells J. King S.R. Stocco D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28314-28322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sense primer, 5′-GACCTTGAAAGGCTCAGGAAGAAC-3′, and the antisense primer, 5′-TAGCTGAAGATGGACAGACTTGC-3′, spanned bases −51 to −27 and 931 to 908, respectively, in relation to the first base of the translation initiation codon. To evaluate the potential variation in RT-PCR efficiency, an internal control, a 395-bp fragment of the L19 ribosomal protein gene was coamplified in each sample, using as sense primer 5′-GAAATCGCCAATGCCAACTC-3′ and as antisense primer 5′-TCTTAGACCTGCGAGCCTCA-3′. RT and PCR of the target genes were run sequentially in the same assay tube, as described previously (41Tena-Sempere M. Zhang F.-P. Huhtaniemi I.T. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1018-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of total RNA from the different experimental groups (2 μg/sample) were reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) and the antisense primers. The cDNAs generated were further amplified by PCR using the primer pairs mentioned above. The total reaction volume was 50 μl which contained 1 nmol/liter of each oligo primer, 200 μmol/liter of a deoxy-NTP mixtures including [α-32P]CTP, 20 units of RNasin, 12.5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase-RT, and 2.5 units of Dynazyme-DNA polymerase in 1 × PCR buffer (10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 50 mmol/liter KCl, 1.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.8) (Finnzymes). The reaction was initiated at 50° C for 15 min (RT) followed by denaturation at 97° C for 5 min. Then the PCR was run with a variable number of cycles of amplification defined by denaturation at 96° C for 1.5 min, annealing at 55° C for 1.5 min, and extension at 72° C for 3 min (PTC-200, Peltier Thermal Cycler, MJ Research, Watertown, MA). The number of PCR cycles examined was 16 to 40, and 16 cycles were chosen for further analysis (data not shown). A final cycle of extension at 72° C for 15 min was included. To examine the PCR products, a 25-μl aliquot of each reaction was analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel. The molecular sizes of the amplified products (StAR and L19) were determined by comparison with the molecular weight markers run in parallel with RT-PCR products. The gels were then vacuum dried and exposed to Kodak x-ray films (XAR-5, Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) at 4° C for 1 to 3 h, and autoradiograms were analyzed for StAR mRNA expression. The relative levels of different signals were quantitated by densitometry (Tina 2.0 Package, Straubenhardt, Germany). For the generation of a competitor, full-length StAR cDNA produced by RT-PCR, as described previously, was subcloned into the pGEM T-vector following instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). The identity of the inserted fragment was confirmed by sequencing with fluorescent dye termination reaction (Prism Ready Reaction Dye Termination Cycle Sequencing Kit) using an automated sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Taking advantage of the presence of two AvaI sites in the StAR cDNA, the subcloned product was subjected to restriction endonuclease digestion, followed by separation in 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The existing AvaI fragment of 407-bp from the full-length StAR cDNA was excised from the gel. The remaining fragments (StAR cDNA subcloned into pGEM T-vector) were subjected to blunt-end ligation by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and the strand was recircularized by T4 DNA ligase, therefore generating a StAR cDNA containing a 407-bp deletion, inserted into the cloning site of the pGEM T-vector. Transcription of the ApaI linearized template by means of the Sp6 RNA polymerase (Promega) generates a sense cRNA of approximately 570 bp length, which was used as the StAR competitor (StAR-2, Fig.1). To confirm the validity and reliability of the quantitative results obtained by RT-PCR, StAR mRNA levels were further assessed by competitive PCR. For this procedure, decreasing concentrations (800–1.56 ng) of the StAR competitor (StAR-2) cRNA were amplified together with a fixed amount of target RNAs (2 μg of total RNA from control and T3 stimulated samples), using the same primer pairs as above. Aliquots of 25 μl of the RT-PCR products were analyzed and the levels of StAR mRNA were evaluated as described above. Twenty micrograms of the total RNA isolated from control and treated groups were resolved on 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Int., Aylesbury, UK) by employing the capillary transfer method. The StAR and SF-1 cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (1800 Ci/mmol) using the Prime-a-Gene labeling method (Promega). The labeled probes were purified by using Sephadex G-50 nick columns (Pharmacia). Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out under stringent conditions as described previously (42Zhang F.-P. Rannikko A.S. Manna P.R. Fraser H.R. Huhtaniemi I.T. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2481-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After hybridization, the membranes were washed twice at room temperature for 20 min with 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS, followed by 2 h at 42° C with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS until removal of the background counts. To examine the variation in StAR and SF-1 mRNA levels, the membranes were subjected to rehybridization with a cDNA probe of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The membranes were then exposed to x-ray films (Kodak XAR-5) for 60–72 h at −80° C. The relative mRNA levels of StAR in different transcripts, SF-1, and GAPDH expression were quantitated as above. Isolation of nuclei from the cells was carried out according to the procedure described elsewhere (43Lawson G.M. Tsai M.J. Tsai S.Y. Minghetti P.P. McClure M.E. O'Malley B.W. Wilson J.W. Foster D.W.

In brief, the cells were lysed by ultrasonication (Bransonic 12, Soest, The Netherlands) in SMNaT buffer (0.25 mol/liter sucrose, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 50 mmol/liter NaHSO3, 10 mmol/liter Tris buffer, pH 7.0) containing 1% Triton X-100 under ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4° C. The crude pellets containing nuclei were again sonicated, washed twice, and examined microscopically with or without stain (acetorcin, 2% orcin in 50% acetic acid). The pellet was finally washed in SMNaT buffer without Triton X-100 and resuspended in SMCT incubation buffer (0.32 mol/liter sucrose, 3 mmol/liter MgCl2, 2 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 10 mmol/liter Tris buffer, pH 7.0). [125I]Iodo-T3 (1080–1320 μCi/μg) binding to the mLTC-1 cell nuclear membrane preparations was performed according to the procedure described earlier (19Jana N.R. Bhattacharya S. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 143: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 44Jana N.R. Halder S. Bhattacharya S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), slightly modified for optimum binding. Briefly, a nuclear membrane preparation (25 μg of DNA/incubation) was incubated with a fixed concentration of [125I]iodo-T3 (100,000 cpm) either in the absence (total) or presence of 600-fold excess of unlabeled T3 (nonspecific) in a final volume of 400 μl. For the competitive inhibition studies, 25 μg of DNA were incubated with 100,000 cpm of [125I]iodo-T3 together with varying concentrations of the unlabeled hormone (1.5–1,500 pmol/liter). The incubation was carried out at 37° C for 2 h, and terminated by adding 2 ml of ice-cold 40% polyethylene glycol (M r 6,000). After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 20 min at 4° C, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet washed twice with the incubation buffer, and finally radioactivity in the pellet was determined in a γ-counter (1260 Multigamma II, LKB Wallac, Turku, Finland). The concentrations of P and T in the media were assessed, after extraction with diethyl ether, with specific RIAs as described previously (45Vuorento T. Lahti A. Hovatta O. Huhtaniemi I.T. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1989; 49: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,46Huhtaniemi I. Nikula H. Rannikko S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1985; 61: 698-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The data are presented as the mean ± S.E. from representative cultures carried out in triplicate or quadruplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statview program following ANOVA (Fisher′s protected least significant differences test) as noted. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The induction of P production by T3 was evaluated for the dependence of on-going protein synthesis. The inhibitors of protein synthesis, actinomycin D and CHX (10 mg/liter each), the former preventing incorporation of methionine into protein and the latter inhibiting RNA synthesis, were examined separately. The cells stimulated with T3 (37.5 pmol/liter) for 8 h showed a significant (4.0 ± 0.2-fold) increase in P production (Fig. 2). Treatment with actinomycin D or CHX remarkably diminished (p < 0.0001) T3-induced P production, suggesting that the T3action is dependent on intact transcription and translation of the target cells. Actinomycin D or CHX alone exhibited no effect on the basal P production. The results summarized in Fig. 2 represent the time-dependent increase in steady-state levels of StAR mRNA and P production in response to T3 (37.5 pmol/liter) stimulation. The T3-induced StAR mRNA expression was significant (p < 0.05) as early as 30 min, and the magnitude of the response gradually increased up to a 3.6 ± 0.4-fold maximum by 8–10 h (Fig.3 A). The StAR mRNA levels declined sharply thereafter, reaching another plateau between 16 and 24 h. The cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP, a well known inducer of the StAR gene expression through activation of the PKA signal transduction pathway (29Clark B.J. Soo S.C. Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L.

It could be clearly seen that a 4-h stimulation with 8-Br-cAMP (1 mmol/liter) elevated the StAR mRNA and P levels about 3.4-fold, which was comparable to that achieved by T3 stimulation in 4 h. The P levels at each time point were determined and expressed as fold increases, and they paralleled those occurring in StAR mRNA"

Both of these consequences of CD40 stimulation have been shown to be dependent on the induction of protein tyrosine kinase activity. CD40-mediated activation of protein tyrosine kinase activity and subsequent inflammatory cytokine production are abrogated by treatment of monocytes with the T helper type 2 cytokines interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). In the current study we demonstrate that stimulation of monocytes through CD40 resulted in the phosphorylation and activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinases, whereas phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases family members p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase was not observed in response to this stimuli over the time course examined. PD98059, an inhibitor of the upstream activator of ERK1/2, the MAP/ERK kinase MEK1/2, suppressed IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α production in a dose-dependent fashion. Pretreatment of monocytes with IL-4 and IL-10 inhibited CD40-mediated activation of ERK1/2 kinase activity when used individually, and are enhanced in effectiveness when used in combination. Together, the data demonstrate that CD40-mediated induction of IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α synthesis is dependent on a MEK/ERK pathway which is obstructed by signals generated through the action of IL-4 and IL-10."

Mutations in XPG can lead to the disorders xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome. XPG shares sequence similarities in two regions with a family of structure-specific nucleases and exonucleases. To begin defining its catalytic mechanism, we changed highly conserved residues and determined the effects on the endonuclease activity of isolated XPG, its function in open complex formation and dual incision reconstituted with purified proteins, and its ability to restore cellular resistance to UV light.

Isolated XPG proteins with Asp-77 or Glu-791 substitutions did not cleave DNA. In the reconstituted repair system, alanine substitutions at these positions permitted open complex formation but were inactive for 3′ cleavage, whereas D77E and E791D proteins retained considerable activity. The function of each mutant protein in the reconstituted system was mirrored by its ability to restore UV resistance to XP-G cell lines.

Individuals with mutations in XPG are almost equally divided between those with the inherited syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and those with a combination of both XP and Cockayne syndrome (CS). The XP phenotype includes acute sun sensitivity with a high incidence of cancers and, in some individuals, progressive neurological degeneration. The even more severe CS is associated with a characteristic constellation of skeletal, neurological, and developmental disorders. Whether an individual is affected with XP only or with both XP and CS is correlated with the severity of the mutation in the XPG gene and its effect on protein function (8Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G.

Res. 1995; 347: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).To gain insight into the important residues for the NER function of XPG, we have introduced site-directed mutations into the conserved N and I regions. A combination of biochemical and cellular tests was then used to measure the function of the mutated proteins. Their intrinsic endonuclease activity was measured on a model bubble substrate, and their repair function was assayed by their ability to form an open preincision complex and to complete dual incision of DNA containing a single cisplatin adduct in the presence of purified NER components. We further tested the mutated XPG proteins for their ability to restore UV resistance to cell lines from two different XP-G individuals. Finally, we used two approaches to examine the possibility that XPG is capable of multimerization. The results emphasize that XPG normally works in the context of a repair complex with other proteins and not as an isolated peptide. We discuss the implications of the results for the XPG incision mechanism and XP-G clinical phenotypes.

Its helicase activities and the XPC-hHR23B heterodimer participate in the formation of a key open intermediate required for dual incision (14Evans E. Fellows J. Coffer A. Wood R.D.

Both nucleases display structure specificity because they cut bubble, splayed arm, or flap structures near the border of single-stranded and duplex DNA. ERCC1-XPF (and itsS. cerevisiae counterpart Rad10-Rad1) cuts on the strand that leads off from the junction in the 5′ → 3′ direction (21Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tomkinson A.E. Friedberg E.C. Science. 1994; 265: 2082-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), whereas XPG (and its S. cerevisiae homolog Rad2) makes endonucleolytic incision close to the 3′ junction, where single-stranded DNA meets duplex DNA (6O'Donovan A.

To gain insight into the important residues for the NER function of XPG, we have introduced site-directed mutations into the conserved N and I regions. A combination of biochemical and cellular tests was then used to measure the function of the mutated proteins. Their intrinsic endonuclease activity was measured on a model bubble substrate, and their repair function was assayed by their ability to form an open preincision complex and to complete dual incision of DNA containing a single cisplatin adduct in the presence of purified NER components. We further tested the mutated XPG proteins for their ability to restore UV resistance to cell lines from two different XP-G individuals. Finally, we used two approaches to examine the possibility that XPG is capable of multimerization. The results emphasize that XPG normally works in the context of a repair complex with other proteins and not as an isolated peptide. We discuss the implications of the results for the XPG incision mechanism and XP-G clinical phenotypes. We thank C. Arlett and J.

J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 291-306Crossref Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The importance of Ca2+ signaling has also been demonstrated in the B cells that are responsible for humoral immunity (2Cambier J.C. Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 457-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In the process of the humoral immune response, antigen binding to the B cell antigen receptor (BCR)1stimulates B cells to proliferate and secrete antigen-specific antibodies. An increase in the intracellular free Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i) is a critical regulatory event in BCR-mediated signal transduction (3Baixeras E. Guido K. Cuende E. Marquez C. Boscá L. Mártinez J. Mártinez A.-C. Immunol. Rev. 1993; 132: 5-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4Yamada H. June C.H. Finkelman F. Brunswick M. Ring M.S. Lees A. Mond J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Modulation of the rise in [Ca2+]i during B cell activation has also been suggested to be a key mechanism for controlling BCR-mediated signal transduction by secondary signals produced by B cell accessory molecules (e.g. CD19, CD21, CD22, CD40, etc.) (2Cambier J.C. Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 457-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 5Peaker C.J.G. Curr. Opin.

Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that the temporal characteristics (i.e. transient or sustained) and the amplitude of the Ca2+ signal are important in activating specific transcription factors (i.e. NF-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, NFAT, etc.), which determine the type of gene expression in the B cell system (7Delmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). Similarly, sustained calcium signals are often associated with enhanced proliferative responses and secretion of antibodies (4Yamada H. June C.H. Finkelman F. Brunswick M. Ring M.S. Lees A. Mond J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, the regulation of Ca2+ signaling determines the ultimate responses of B cells, which specifically include proliferation, apoptosis, and secretion of specific antibodies.Despite the prominent role of Ca2+ in B cell activation, the molecular mechanisms responsible for Ca2+ movement in B cells are not clearly understood. To date, the regulation of [Ca2+]i in the B cell system is still explained almost solely by IP3-mediated mechanisms. Antigen binding to the BCR induces a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i(8Bijsterbosch M.K. Rigley K.P. Klaus G.G.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Roifman C.M. Mills G.B. Stewart D. Cheung R.K. Grinstein S. Gelfand E.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The initial, rapid phase of the BCR-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i is the result of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, whereas the subsequent, sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i results from Ca2+ entry through plasma membrane channels, as indicated by its abolition in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (8Bijsterbosch M.K. Rigley K.P. Klaus G.G.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Roifman C.M. Mills G.B. Stewart D. Cheung R.K. Grinstein S. Gelfand E.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As suggested in other types of non-excitable cells (10Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar, 11Takemura H. Hughes A.R. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zweifach A. Lewis R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 1993: 6295-6299Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar), BCR-mediated Ca2+entry is hypothesized to be a consequence of the emptying of the intracellular IP3-sensitive Ca2+ store (“capacitative” Ca2+ entry mechanism) (13Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Thus, BCR-stimulation generates IP3, which activates Ca2+ release from IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores, causing Ca2+ channels to open the so-called store-operated channel. However, there are reports indicating that IP3 production does not always correlate with the magnitude of Ca2+ release (9Roifman C.M. Mills G.B. Stewart D. Cheung R.K. Grinstein S. Gelfand E.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Padeh S. Levitzki A. Gazit A. Mills G.B. Roifman C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that an IP3-insensitive Ca2+ store is involved in BCR-mediated Ca2+ signaling in B cells.This study suggests that the ryanodine receptor (RYR) may contribute to the IP3-insensitive component of BCR-stimulated Ca2+ signaling. The RYR was originally found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle (type 1 receptor, RYR1) and cardiac muscle (type 2 receptor, RYR2) (15Otsu K. Willard H.F. Khanna V.K. Zorzato F. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13472-13483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H.

Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through these receptors plays a central role in regulating the contraction of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers. A third type of RYR (type 3 receptor, RYR3) has been detected in specific regions of the brain, such as corpus striatum, thalamus, and hippocampus (18Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 19Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Nishi M. Ikeda M. Sugimoto T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and in human Jurkat T cells (20Hakamata Y. Nishimura S. Nakai J. Nakashima Y. Kita T. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that the ryanodine receptor detectable in B cells is identical to the skeletal muscle type (RYR1). Moreover, the receptor was found to function as a Ca2+ release channel during BCR-stimulated Ca2+ signaling. Therefore, upon BCR stimulation, B cells utilize at least two types of Ca2+ release channels, the IP3 receptor and RYR1, to generate highly elaborate Ca2+ signaling.DISCUSSIONAlthough an IP3-insensitive Ca2+ store has been suggested to be involved in BCR-mediated Ca2+signaling in B cells (9Roifman C.M. Mills G.B. Stewart D. Cheung R.K. Grinstein S. Gelfand E.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Padeh S. Levitzki A. Gazit A. Mills G.B. Roifman C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), neither the status of expression nor the function of the RYR has been studied in human B cells. In this report, we show that human B cells express a functional RYR that is likely involved in BCR-mediated Ca2+ signaling in B cells. Interestingly, unless an alternative splicing variant exists, selective RT-PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism, cloning, and cDNA sequence analysis indicate that the major isoform of the RYR expressed in B cells is a type 1 isoform of RYR that was originally recognized to be abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle (33Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1740-1747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Considering our current understanding of the functional properties of the isoforms, it is interesting that non-excitable B cells express RYR1 rather than RYR3. RYR1 in skeletal muscle is activated by direct physical coupling to the voltage-sensitive dihydropyridine receptor, whereas RYR3 is activated by cyclic ADP-ribose, which may act as a second messenger for intracellular Ca2+ signaling in non-muscle cells (1Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 291-306Crossref Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 34Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar). However, because the L-type dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channel has recently been suggested to be involved in anti-Ig-induced Ca2+ influx in rat B lymphocytes (35Akha A.A.S. Willmott N.J. Brickley K. Dolphin A.C. Galione A. Hunt S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7297-7300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it may be important to investigate whether the dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channel is expressed and associated with RYR1 in human B cells.Pharmacological studies indicate that the RYR expressed in B cells functions as a Ca2+ channel. 4-CmC, a RYR stimulator observed in skeletal muscle (30Herrmann-Frank A. Richter M. Sarkozi S. Mohr U. Lehmann-Horn F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Herrmann-Frank A. Richter M. Lehmann-Horn F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32Zorzato F. Scutari E. Tegazzin V. Clementi E. Treves S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1192-1201PubMed Google Scholar), increased [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent fashion in both primary CD19+ (or CD21+) B cells and DAKIKI cells. That 4-CmC-induced increases in [Ca2+]i result largely from Ca2+release from intracellular Ca2+ stores was indicated by the maintenance of [Ca2+]i in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Moreover, in the presence of 200 μm ryanodine, 4-CmC induced a higher maximum and slower decay in [Ca2+]i than in the control. These results may be related to the findings in skeletal muscle that ryanodine keeps the Ca2+ release channel of the intracellular Ca2+ stores in an open state (36Imagawa T. Smith J.S. Coronado R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16636-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus maintaining RYR-mediated elevations in [Ca2+]i. However, in skeletal muscle, high affinity ryanodine-binding sites (K d ≈ 1–5 nm) lock the Ca2+ channel in an open state, whereas low affinity sites (K d ≈ 30–80 nm) inhibit channel opening (34Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar, 37Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations of ryanodine (<10 μm) tend to activate Ca2+ release, whereas higher concentrations (>200 μm) block the Ca2+ channel in skeletal muscle (34Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar, 37Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).B cells were found to have a single affinity site for [3H]ryanodine with a K d of 110 nm. Although this appears to be similar to the low affinity site in skeletal muscle, it behaves like the high affinity site. This may be due to differences in stoichiometry, localization of the receptor, or association with endogenous effectors. Indeed, pharmacological properties of RYR1, including [3H]ryanodine binding, vary greatly in different cell types (34Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar, 37Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RYR1 in skeletal muscle is well known to be abundant at the triad junction; physically attached to the voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel localized in the transverse tubular membrane; and associated with triadin, calmodulin, and FK506-binding protein (34Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar,37Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither localization of the receptor nor its association with other modulatory proteins is known in B lymphocytes.Findings by other investigators have already suggested that an IP3-insensitive Ca2+ store is involved in BCR-mediated Ca2+ signaling in human B lymphocytes. For example, following BCR stimulation, increases in [Ca2+]i of 25–35% of control levels were not affected when IP3 production was abolished by tyrosine kinase inhibition (14Padeh S. Levitzki A. Gazit A. Mills G.B. Roifman C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similarly, inositol monophosphate generation did not correlate well with changes in Ca2+ in human B cells when these two parameters were compared over different types of stimulation, i.e. cross-linking membrane IgG, IgD, and IgM (9Roifman C.M. Mills G.B. Stewart D. Cheung R.K. Grinstein S. Gelfand E.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cross-linking membrane IgD induced the largest release of Ca2+, but the inositol monophosphate production was the lowest.In addition to the molecular biological evidence of expression of RYR1 in human B cells, pharmacological studies suggest that the release of Ca2+ from stores through the RYR is involved in BCR-mediated Ca2+ signaling. Similar to its effects on 4-CmC-induced Ca2+ release, F(ab)2 anti-IgM in the presence of ryanodine induced a higher maximum and a slower decay in [Ca2+]i in Ca2+-containing medium (data not shown) and a higher maximum in Ca2+-free medium than in the control (Fig. 5, A and C). These results suggest that ryanodine maintains a Ca2+ release channel in an open state, as demonstrated in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, depleting Ca2+ in the 4-CmC-sensitive store significantly decreased the magnitude of BCR-mediated Ca2+release (Fig. 5, B and C), suggesting that B cells utilize a RYR-operated Ca2+ store during BCR-mediated activation perhaps in conjunction with the IP3receptor.B cells appear to decode diverse patterns of Ca2+ waves as signals to determine their ultimate responses, such as proliferation, apoptosis, and secretion of specific antibodies (7Delmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). Such highly intricate patterns of Ca2+ waves may be generated by cooperation of the IP3 receptor and RYR1 during BCR-stimulated Ca2+ signaling. It is also possible that RYR1 may play a specific role in B cell activation. In lymphocytes, IP3 and the RYR coexist in murine T lymphoma BW5147 cells (38Bourguignon L.Y.W. Chu A. Jin H. Brandt N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17917-17922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and human Jurkat T cells (20Hakamata Y. Nishimura S. Nakai J. Nakashima Y. Kita T. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the BW5147 cells, a RYR that exhibits only a single, low affinity [3H]ryanodine-binding site (K d = 200 nm) becomes associated with concanavalin A receptor-patched and -capped structures following concanavalin A stimulation (38Bourguignon L.Y.W. Chu A. Jin H. Brandt N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17917-17922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Similarly, Ono et al. (39Ono A. Tatsumi H. Yamamoto K. Katayama Y. Bull. Tokyo Med. Dent. Univ. 1995; 42: 9-18PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the Epstein-Barr virus caused increases in [Ca2+]i in a ryanodine-sensitive manner and was temporally associated with Epstein-Barr virus receptor (CD21) capping in human B lymphocytes. Despite the relatively low density of RYR expression, the much larger Ca2+ conductance generated through the RYR (compared with the IP3 receptor channel) may make it more effective in producing the significant changes in Ca2+ required for spatiotemporal phenomena such as movement of cellular components (e.g. patching and capping) and secretion of Ig, hypotheses that are now under investigation. In all cells, calcium ions play a critical role in the regulation of diverse cell activities, including gene expression, folding and processing of proteins, exocytosis and endocytosis, cell cycle progression, motility, proliferation, and differentiation (1Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 291-306Crossref Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The importance of Ca2+ signaling has also been demonstrated in the B cells that are responsible for humoral immunity (2Cambier J.C. Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 457-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In the process of the humoral immune response, antigen binding to the B cell antigen receptor (BCR)1stimulates B cells to proliferate and secrete antigen-specific antibodies. An increase in the intracellular free Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i) is a critical regulatory event in BCR-mediated signal transduction (3Baixeras E. Guido K. Cuende E. Marquez C. Boscá L. Mártinez J.

Modulation of the rise in [Ca2+]i during B cell activation has also been suggested to be a key mechanism for controlling BCR-mediated signal transduction by secondary signals produced by B cell accessory molecules (e.g. CD19, CD21, CD22, CD40, etc.) (2Cambier J.C. Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 457-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 5Peaker C.J.G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 6Tedder T.F. Zhou L.-J. Engel P. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 437-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that the temporal characteristics (i.e. transient or sustained) and the amplitude of the Ca2+ signal are important in activating specific transcription factors (i.e. NF-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, NFAT, etc.), which determine the type of gene expression in the B cell system (7Delmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). Similarly, sustained calcium signals are often associated with enhanced proliferative responses and secretion of antibodies (4Yamada H. June C.H. Finkelman F. Brunswick M. Ring M.S. Lees A. Mond J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, the regulation of Ca2+ signaling determines the ultimate responses of B cells, which specifically include proliferation, apoptosis, and secretion of specific antibodies. Despite the prominent role of Ca2+ in B cell activation, the molecular mechanisms responsible for Ca2+ movement in B cells are not clearly understood. To date, the regulation of [Ca2+]i in the B cell system is still explained almost solely by IP3-mediated mechanisms. Antigen binding to the BCR induces a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i(8Bijsterbosch M.K. Rigley K.P. Klaus G.G.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Roifman C.M. Mills G.B. Stewart D. Cheung R.K. Grinstein S. Gelfand E.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The initial, rapid phase of the BCR-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i is the result of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, whereas the subsequent, sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i results from Ca2+ entry through plasma membrane channels, as indicated by its abolition in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (8Bijsterbosch M.K. Rigley K.P. Klaus G.G.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Roifman C.M. Mills G.B. Stewart D. Cheung R.K. Grinstein S. Gelfand E.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As suggested in other types of non-excitable cells (10Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar, 11Takemura H. Hughes A.R. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zweifach A. Lewis R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 1993: 6295-6299Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar), BCR-mediated Ca2+entry is hypothesized to be a consequence of the emptying of the intracellular IP3-sensitive Ca2+ store (“capacitative” Ca2+ entry mechanism) (13Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Thus, BCR-stimulation generates IP3, which activates Ca2+ release from IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores, causing Ca2+ channels to open the so-called store-operated channel. However, there are reports indicating that IP3 production does not always correlate with the magnitude of Ca2+ release (9Roifman C.M. Mills G.B. Stewart D. Cheung R.K. Grinstein S. Gelfand E.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Padeh S. Levitzki A. Gazit A. Mills G.B. Roifman C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that an IP3-insensitive Ca2+ store is involved in BCR-mediated Ca2+ signaling in B cells. This study suggests that the ryanodine receptor (RYR) may contribute to the IP3-insensitive component of BCR-stimulated Ca2+ signaling. The RYR was originally found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle (type 1 receptor, RYR1) and cardiac muscle (type 2 receptor, RYR2) (15Otsu K. Willard H.F. Khanna V.K. Zorzato F. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13472-13483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H.

Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through these receptors plays a central role in regulating the contraction of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers. A third type of RYR (type 3 receptor, RYR3) has been detected in specific regions of the brain, such as corpus striatum, thalamus, and hippocampus (18Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 19Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Nishi M. Ikeda M. Sugimoto T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and in human Jurkat T cells (20Hakamata Y. Nishimura S. Nakai J. Nakashima Y. Kita T. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that the ryanodine receptor detectable in B cells is identical to the skeletal muscle type (RYR1). Moreover, the receptor was found to function as a Ca2+ release channel during BCR-stimulated Ca2+ signaling. Therefore, upon BCR stimulation, B cells utilize at least two types of Ca2+ release channels, the IP3 receptor and RYR1, to generate highly elaborate Ca2+ signaling. DISCUSSIONAlthough an IP3-insensitive Ca2+ store has been suggested to be involved in BCR-mediated Ca2+signaling in B cells (9Roifman C.M. Mills G.B. Stewart D. Cheung R.K. Grinstein S. Gelfand E.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Padeh S. Levitzki A. Gazit A. Mills G.B. Roifman C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), neither the status of expression nor the function of the RYR has been studied in human B cells. In this report, we show that human B cells express a functional RYR that is likely involved in BCR-mediated Ca2+ signaling in B cells. Interestingly, unless an alternative splicing variant exists, selective RT-PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism, cloning, and cDNA sequence analysis indicate that the major isoform of the RYR expressed in B cells is a type 1 isoform of RYR that was originally recognized to be abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle (33Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1740-1747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Considering our current understanding of the functional properties of the isoforms, it is interesting that non-excitable B cells express RYR1 rather than RYR3. RYR1 in skeletal muscle is activated by direct physical coupling to the voltage-sensitive dihydropyridine receptor, whereas RYR3 is activated by cyclic ADP-ribose, which may act as a second messenger for intracellular Ca2+ signaling in non-muscle cells (1Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 291-306Crossref Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 34Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar). However, because the L-type dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channel has recently been suggested to be involved in anti-Ig-induced Ca2+ influx in rat B lymphocytes (35Akha A.A.S. Willmott N.J. Brickley K. Dolphin A.C. Galione A. Hunt S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7297-7300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it may be important to investigate whether the dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channel is expressed and associated with RYR1 in human B cells.Pharmacological studies indicate that the RYR expressed in B cells functions as a Ca2+ channel. 4-CmC, a RYR stimulator observed in skeletal muscle (30Herrmann-Frank A. Richter M. Sarkozi S. Mohr U. Lehmann-Horn F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Herrmann-Frank A. Richter M. Lehmann-Horn F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32Zorzato F. Scutari E. Tegazzin V. Clementi E. Treves S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1192-1201PubMed Google Scholar), increased [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent fashion in both primary CD19+ (or CD21+) B cells and DAKIKI cells. That 4-CmC-induced increases in [Ca2+]i result largely from Ca2+release from intracellular Ca2+ stores was indicated by the maintenance of [Ca2+]i in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Moreover, in the presence of 200 μm ryanodine, 4-CmC induced a higher maximum and slower decay in [Ca2+]i than in the control. These results may be related to the findings in skeletal muscle that ryanodine keeps the Ca2+ release channel of the intracellular Ca2+ stores in an open state (36Imagawa T. Smith J.S. Coronado R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16636-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus maintaining RYR-mediated elevations in [Ca2+]i. However, in skeletal muscle, high affinity ryanodine-binding sites (K d ≈ 1–5 nm) lock the Ca2+ channel in an open state, whereas low affinity sites (K d ≈ 30–80 nm) inhibit channel opening (34Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar, 37Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations of ryanodine (<10 μm) tend to activate Ca2+ release, whereas higher concentrations (>200 μm) block the Ca2+ channel in skeletal muscle (34Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar, 37Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).B cells were found to have a single affinity site for [3H]ryanodine with a K d of 110 nm. Although this appears to be similar to the low affinity site in skeletal muscle, it behaves like the high affinity site. This may be due to differences in stoichiometry, localization of the receptor, or association with endogenous effectors. Indeed, pharmacological properties of RYR1, including [3H]ryanodine binding, vary greatly in different cell types (34Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar, 37Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RYR1 in skeletal muscle is well known to be abundant at the triad junction; physically attached to the voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel localized in the transverse tubular membrane; and associated with triadin, calmodulin, and FK506-binding protein (34Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar,37Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither localization of the receptor nor its association with other modulatory proteins is known in B lymphocytes.Findings by other investigators have already suggested that an IP3-insensitive Ca2+ store is involved in BCR-mediated Ca2+ signaling in human B lymphocytes. For example, following BCR stimulation, increases in [Ca2+]i of 25–35% of control levels were not affected when IP3 production was abolished by tyrosine kinase inhibition (14Padeh S. Levitzki A. Gazit A. Mills G.B. Roifman C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similarly, inositol monophosphate generation did not correlate well with changes in Ca2+ in human B cells when these two parameters were compared over different types of stimulation, i.e. cross-linking membrane IgG, IgD, and IgM (9Roifman C.M. Mills G.B. Stewart D. Cheung R.K. Grinstein S. Gelfand E.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cross-linking membrane IgD induced the largest release of Ca2+, but the inositol monophosphate production was the lowest.In addition to the molecular biological evidence of expression of RYR1 in human B cells, pharmacological studies suggest that the release of Ca2+ from stores through the RYR is involved in BCR-mediated Ca2+ signaling. Similar to its effects on 4-CmC-induced Ca2+ release, F(ab)2 anti-IgM in the presence of ryanodine induced a higher maximum and a slower decay in [Ca2+]i in Ca2+-containing medium (data not shown) and a higher maximum in Ca2+-free medium than in the control (Fig. 5, A and C). These results suggest that ryanodine maintains a Ca2+ release channel in an open state, as demonstrated in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, depleting Ca2+ in the 4-CmC-sensitive store significantly decreased the magnitude of BCR-mediated Ca2+release (Fig. 5, B and C), suggesting that B cells utilize a RYR-operated Ca2+ store during BCR-mediated activation perhaps in conjunction with the IP3receptor.B cells appear to decode diverse patterns of Ca2+ waves as signals to determine their ultimate responses, such as proliferation, apoptosis, and secretion of specific antibodies (7Delmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). Such highly intricate patterns of Ca2+ waves may be generated by cooperation of the IP3 receptor and RYR1 during BCR-stimulated Ca2+ signaling. It is also possible that RYR1 may play a specific role in B cell activation. In lymphocytes, IP3 and the RYR coexist in murine T lymphoma BW5147 cells (38Bourguignon L.Y.W. Chu A. Jin H. Brandt N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17917-17922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and human Jurkat T cells (20Hakamata Y. Nishimura S. Nakai J. Nakashima Y. Kita T. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the BW5147 cells, a RYR that exhibits only a single, low affinity [3H]ryanodine-binding site (K d = 200 nm) becomes associated with concanavalin A receptor-patched and -capped structures following concanavalin A stimulation (38Bourguignon L.Y.W. Chu A. Jin H. Brandt N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17917-17922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Similarly, Ono et al. (39Ono A. Tatsumi H. Yamamoto K. Katayama Y. Bull. Tokyo Med. Dent. Univ. 1995; 42: 9-18PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the Epstein-Barr virus caused increases in [Ca2+]i in a ryanodine-sensitive manner and was temporally associated with Epstein-Barr virus receptor (CD21) capping in human B lymphocytes. Despite the relatively low density of RYR expression, the much larger Ca2+ conductance generated through the RYR (compared with the IP3 receptor channel) may make it more effective in producing the significant changes in Ca2+ required for spatiotemporal phenomena such as movement of cellular components (e.g. patching and capping) and secretion of Ig, hypotheses that are now under investigation. Although an IP3-insensitive Ca2+ store has been suggested to be involved in BCR-mediated Ca2+signaling in B cells (9Roifman C.M. Mills G.B. Stewart D. Cheung R.K. Grinstein S. Gelfand E.W. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W2128588563,"Scorpion neurotoxins of the excitatory group show total specificity for insects and serve as invaluable probes for insect sodium channels. However, despite their significance and potential for application in insect-pest control, the structural basis for their bioactivity is still unknown. We isolated, characterized, and expressed an atypically long excitatory toxin, Bj-xtrIT, whose bioactive features resembled those of classical excitatory toxins, despite only 49% sequence identity. With the objective of clarifying the toxic site of this unique pharmacological group, Bj-xtrIT was employed in a genetic approach using point mutagenesis and biological and structural assays of the mutant products. A primary target for modification was the structurally unique C-terminal region. Sequential deletions of C-terminal residues suggested an inevitable significance of Ile73 and Ile74 for toxicity. Based on the bioactive role of the C-terminal region and a comparison of Bj-xtrIT with a Bj-xtrIT-based model of a classical excitatory toxin, AaHIT, a conserved surface comprising the C terminus is suggested to form the site of recognition with the sodium channel receptor. Scorpion neurotoxins of the excitatory group show total specificity for insects and serve as invaluable probes for insect sodium channels. However, despite their significance and potential for application in insect-pest control, the structural basis for their bioactivity is still unknown. We isolated, characterized, and expressed an atypically long excitatory toxin, Bj-xtrIT, whose bioactive features resembled those of classical excitatory toxins, despite only 49% sequence identity. With the objective of clarifying the toxic site of this unique pharmacological group, Bj-xtrIT was employed in a genetic approach using point mutagenesis and biological and structural assays of the mutant products. A primary target for modification was the structurally unique C-terminal region. Sequential deletions of C-terminal residues suggested an inevitable significance of Ile73 and Ile74 for toxicity. Based on the bioactive role of the C-terminal region and a comparison of Bj-xtrIT with a Bj-xtrIT-based model of a classical excitatory toxin, AaHIT, a conserved surface comprising the C terminus is suggested to form the site of recognition with the sodium channel receptor. high pressure liquid chromatography polymerase chain reaction Scorpion venom contains a diversity of protein toxins, which modify the properties of neural ion channels. The excitatory toxins are highly specific to insects, have a characteristic structure and mode of action, and define a unique receptor-binding site on the insect sodium channel (1Zlotkin E.

Unlike all other “long” scorpion toxins with 60–65 amino acid residues and a highly conserved pattern of four disulfide bridges, the excitatory toxins reported thus far are composed of 70 amino acid residues, and one of their disulfide bonds is shifted (3Oren D.

Excitatory toxins such as AaHIT, LqqIT1, and AmmIT induce spastic paralysis caused by repetitive activity of motor nerves (5Zlotkin E. Rochat H. Kopeyan C. Miranda F. Lissitzky S.

AaHIT and other excitatory toxins define a high affinity (K d = 1–3 nm), low capacity (1–2 pmol/mg of protein) binding site in insect neural membrane (1Zlotkin E. Endeavour. 1987; 11: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Gordon D. Jover E. Couraud F. Zlotkin E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 778: 349-358Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Their high potency makes them as an attractive model for development of anti-insect-selective biopesticides. Indeed, AaHIT played a prominent role in early attempts to engineer entomopathogenic baculoviruses (12Maeda S. Volrath S.L. Hanzlik T.N. Harper S.A. Majuma K. Maddox D.W. Hammock B.D. Fowler E.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It has become apparent that detailed structure-activity analysis of these toxins depends on their efficient overproduction in heterologous systems. However, many attempts to establish a genetic system for high level production of AaHIT in COS cells (18Bougis P.E. Rochat H. Smith L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19259-19265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), insect cells (12Maeda S. Volrath S.L. Hanzlik T.N. Harper S.A. Majuma K. Maddox D.W. Hammock B.D. Fowler E.

Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have been very limited, and toxin detection could be achieved only with antibodies or by neurotoxic symptoms. The difficulty in obtaining reasonable amounts of pure protein also hampered three-dimensional structure determination of this toxin group. Indeed, only one report describing the secondary structure and overall fold of AaHIT has been published (21Darbon H. Weber C. Braun W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Other obstacles limiting a genetic study of excitatory toxins are the small number of toxins identified thus far and their prominent sequence similarity. Only two, highly homologous excitatory toxins (AaHIT and LqqIT1) have been sequenced during the last 3 decades (5Zlotkin E. Rochat H. Kopeyan C. Miranda F. Lissitzky S. Biochimie (Paris). 1971; 53: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,6Kopeyan C. Mansuelle P. Sampieri F. Brando T. Bahraoui E.M. Rochat H. Granier C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and two additional excitatory toxins have been isolated (AmmIT (7Zlotkin E. Teitelbaum Z. Rochat H. Miranda F. Insect Biochem. 1979; 9: 347-354Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and BjIT1 (9Lester D. Lazarovici P. Pelhate M. Zlotkin E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 701: 370-381Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar)). Recently, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of a novel excitatory toxin, Bj-xtrIT (3Oren D. Froy O. Amit E. Kleinberger-Doron N. Gurevitz M. Shaanan B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1095-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and have shown that, despite the unique architecture of its C-terminal module, the core consisting of an α-helix and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet was similar to those found in various pharmacologically distinct scorpion toxins,e.g. AaH II and CsE v3 (22Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 29: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Evidently, the difference in bioactivity of the various toxins is dictated by their non-similar exteriors composed of various amino acid side chains, loops, and turns connecting the conserved secondary structure elements and the C termini. Herein we report the purification, cloning, and functional expression of Bj-xtrIT and its utilization in a genetic modification study. By combining site-directed mutagenesis with functional and structural analyses, we delineated specific amino acid residues clustered on a molecular surface forming the putative bioactive domain of scorpion excitatory neurotoxins. Buthotus judaicus scorpions were collected at the Carmel mountains of Israel, and their venom was collected upon stinging a Parafilm membrane. Sarcophaga falculata blowfly larvae,Spodoptera littoralis noctuid larvae, and Periplaneta americana cockroaches were bred in the laboratory. Albino laboratory ICR mice were purchased from the Levenstein farm (Yokneam, Israel). Escherichia coli strains DH5α and BL21 were used for plasmid construction and expression, respectively. The translational vector used, pET-11cK, is a pET-11c derivative (23Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D. Lin S. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar) bearing a gene for kanamycin resistance. Crude venom (7.7 mg) from 35 scorpions was lyophilized, dissolved in 3 ml of 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.7), and subjected to three successive chromatographic steps. 1) Cation-exchange chromatography was carried out on a 2.5-ml CM52-cellulose column (Whatman) equilibrated in 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.7). After elution of 5 ml, a linear gradient of 10–400 mmammonium acetate (pH 6.7) was applied at room temperature (20 °C) with a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min, and 1.2-ml fractions were collected. 2) Anion-exchange chromatography was performed on a 0.8-ml DEAE-Sephadex column (Sigma) equilibrated in 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 8.0). The active fraction obtained in step 1 was chromatographed using a linear gradient of 0.01–1.0 m ammonium acetate (pH 8.0) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature. Fractions were collected in 1.5-ml aliquots. 3) Reverse-phase HPLC1 was carried out on a Vydac C18 column (250 × 10 mm) using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as solvent A and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile as solvent B. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of solvent B: 10 min with 0–23%, 40 min with 23–35%, 15 min with 35–40%, and a final 10 min with 40–100%. Amino acid sequence analysis followed automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems gas-phase sequencer connected to its corresponding phenylthiohydantoin analyzer and data system. Fifteen venom gland segments (telsons) were ground for RNA purification. Isolation of poly(A)+ RNA and cDNA synthesis were performed as described previously (24Zilberberg N. Zlotkin E. Gurevitz M. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A library inE. coli strain DH5α was obtained by cloning 50 ng of cDNA into the SmaI polylinker site of pBluescript phagemid (Stratagene). A degenerate oligonucleotide (primer 1), 5′-AA(A/G)AA(A/G)AA(T/C)GGNTA(T/C)CCN(C/T)T-3′, designed according to the N-terminal amino acid sequence, was PCR-amplified with a second oligonucleotide (primer 2), 5′-ATTCCTGCAGCCCTTTTTTT-3′, composed of a pBluescript stretch at the SmaI site and additional deoxythymidines, using the cDNA library as a template. Reaction conditions were 30 cycles for 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was blunt-ended, phosphorylated, cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript, and subjected to sequence analysis using Sequenase II (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Full-length cDNA clones were obtained using an oligonucleotide (primer 3), 5′-CGGGATCCCTATGAGGGTATTATTTGG-3′, designed according to the sequence of the noncoding strand of the region encoding the C terminus of Bj-xtrIT and with a terminalBamHI site (underlined), and the KS primer (Stratagene). Oligonucleotide primers were used to reconstruct via PCR the cDNA termini of Bj-xtrIT.38E, Bj-xtrIT.38K, and Lqh-xtrIT (formerly termed LqhIT1) (25Froy O. Sagiv T. Poreh M. Urbach D. Zilberberg N. Gurevitz M. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). For Bj-xtrIT, primer 4 (5′-GGAATTCCATATGAAGAAGAACGGATATCCTCTG-3′ was designed (i) to remove the putative leader sequence, (ii) to create an additional codon for methionine at position −1 of the mature polypeptide, and (iii) to provide an NdeI restriction site (underlined) within the ATG start codon. Primer 3, designed beforehand to contain aBamHI restriction site, was used for reconstruction of the 3′-end. Similarly, primers 5 (5′-AACATATGAAGAAGAATGGGTATGCTGTC-3′) and 6 (5′-CCGGATCCCTAATTAATTATTGTGAAATC-3′) were used to reconstruct Lqh-xtrIT. Primer 7 (5′-CGGGATCCCTACCCGCAATATTTTTTGGTG-3′) was designed to replace the last seven amino acid residues with glycine and to add a BamHI restriction site (underlined). This primer was employed with primer 4 via PCR to construct the Bj-xtrIT.ΔC-ter mutant. The PCR products were cloned into the corresponding NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-11cK. Expression and purification of recombinant proteins followed an established method (26Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Pelhate M. Adams M.E. Norris T. Zlotkin E. Gurevitz M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10215-10222Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Conditions for optimized folding of recombinant proteins were previously described (26Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Pelhate M. Adams M.E. Norris T. Zlotkin E. Gurevitz M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10215-10222Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Turkov M. Rashi S. Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Ben Khalifa R. Stankiewicz M. Pelhate M. Gurevitz M. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Four-day-old blowfly larvae (∼100 mg of body weight) were injected intersegmentally at the rear side. A positive result was scored when a characteristic paralysis (immobilization and contraction) was observed and lasted for at least 15 min. Ten larvae were injected with five concentrations of each toxin in three independent experiments. S. littoralis third instar larvae (∼70 mg) were injected in their pseudopodia, and a positive effect was scored upon paralytic immobilization. ED50 (effective dose 50%) values for flies and PU50 (paralytic unit 50%) values for moths were calculated according to the sampling and estimation method of Reed and Muench (28Reed L. Muench H. Am. J. Hyg. 1938; 27: 493-497Google Scholar). Twenty-gram female mice were injected subcutaneously with toxin amounts up to 0.2 mg. Insect synaptosomes were prepared from heads of adult cockroaches (P. americana) according to a procedure previously described for blowfly heads (29Gordon D. Moskowitz H. Zlotkin E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1026: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,30Zlotkin E. Gordon D. Miller T.A. Breer H. Neurochemical Techniques in Insect Research. Springer-Verlag, New York1985: 243-295Crossref Google Scholar). All buffers used contained a mixture of protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm iodoacetamide, and 1 mm1,10-phenanthroline). Membrane protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. AaHIT and LqhIT2 were radioiodinated with IODO-GEN (Pierce) using 5 mg of toxin and 0.5 mCi of carrier-free Na125I as described previously (31Gordon D. Moskowitz H. Eitan M. Warner C. Catterall W.A. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7622-7628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The monoiodotoxins were purified on a Vydac RP C18 column using a gradient of 5–90% solvent B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (32Cestele S. Khalifa R.B. Pelhate M. Rochat H. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15153-15161Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The concentration of the radiolabeled toxins was determined according to the specific activity of the monoiodotoxin ranging between 4200 and 3450 dpm/fmol. Equilibrium competition and saturation assays were performed using increasing concentrations of unlabeled toxin in the presence of a constant low concentration of radioactive toxin. To obtain saturation curves (“cold” saturation), the specific radioactivity and the amount of bound toxin were calculated and determined for each toxin concentration. Equilibrium saturation or competition experiments were analyzed by the iterative computer program LIGAND (Elsevier Biosoft, Cambridge United Kingdom) using cold saturation and “drug” analysis, respectively. Standard binding medium composition was 135 mm choline-Cl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 10 mm glucose, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Washing buffer composition was similar, but with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and no glucose. Insect synaptosomes (10–14 μg/ml) were suspended in 0.2 ml of binding buffer containing 125I-AaHIT or125I-LqhIT2. After incubation for 1 h at 22 °C, the reaction mixture was diluted with 2 ml of ice-cold washing buffer and filtered through GF/C filters under vacuum. Filters were rapidly washed with an additional 2 × 2 ml of buffer. Nonspecific binding of toxin was determined in the presence of 2 μm LqhIT2 and yielded 20–30% of total binding for 125I-AaHIT or 30–40% for125I-LhqIT2. The curves were fit to the data points by the empirical Hill equation (for Bj-xtrIT) and by nonlinear regression (for LqhIT2). The best fit for LqhIT2 was obtained using the two-site model (p = 0.997 by LIGAND). Recordings in current-clamp and voltage-clamp conditions were performed on cockroach isolated giant axons using the double oil-gap single fiber technique (33Pichon Y. Boistel J. J. Exp. Biol. 1967; 47: 343-355PubMed Google Scholar). Axon isolation and the recording technique were previously described in detail (34Pelhate M. Sattelle D.B. J. Insect Physiol. 1982; 28: 889-903Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The isolated axon was superfused by physiological saline (buffered to pH 7.2 with 1 mm HEPES) containing 210 mm NaCl, 3.1 mm KCl, 5.2 mm MgCl2, and 5.4 mm CaCl2. Potassium currents were blocked in voltage-clamp conditions by superfusion with 0.5 mm3,4-diaminopyridine (Sigma), and sodium currents with 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin (Sigma). Lyophilized recombinant and native Bj-xtrIT toxins were dissolved in normal saline to a concentration of 1 μm in the presence of 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Fibers, providing action potentials of at least 95 mV in amplitude, were used in current-clamp conditions. Action potentials were evoked every 5 s by passing short (0.5 ms) 10-nA pulses. Toxins were dissolved in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7). Spectra were measured at 20 °C in 0.05-mm path length cells from 260 to 178 nm with a JOBIN-YVON UV CD spectrophotometer (Mark VI). Calibration was performed with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. A ratio of 2.2 was found between the positive CD band at 290.5 nm and the negative band at 192.5 nm. Data were collected at 0.5-nm intervals with a scan rate of 1 nm/min. CD spectra are reported as Δε per amide. Protein concentration was in the range of 0.5–1 mg/ml as determined on a Beckman amino acid analyzer. Secondary structure content was determined according to the method of Manavalan and Johnson (35Manavalan P. Johnson W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The initial AaHIT model was constructed on the basis of the structural alignment with Bj-xtrIT (3Oren D. Froy O. Amit E. Kleinberger-Doron N. Gurevitz M. Shaanan B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1095-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Using the Insight Homology program (MSI, Cambridge United Kingdom), residues in the Bj-xtrIT model were replaced by homologous residues in AaHIT according to the alignment. As shown in Fig. 1, residues 17 and 26 of Bj-xtrIT are aligned with residues 17 and 21 of AaHIT as a result of an insertion of five residues in Bj-xtrIT. To accommodate the difference in length of the polypeptide chain around this region, a minor manual adjustment was performed using the program O (37Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). Further manual adjustments were applied to side chains of several residues in order to alleviate severe steric clash with close neighbors. This initial model was subjected to 2000 steps of energy minimization using the program X-PLOR (38Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, Version3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and the energy parameters described by Engh and Huber (39Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). During the minimization, protein atoms were allowed to move under the constraints of known protein stereochemistry as applied in X-PLOR. However, since the underlying assumption in modeling AaHIT was its structural resemblance to Bj-xtrIT, the C-α atoms of AaHIT were harmonically restrained (38Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, Version3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) to their positions in Bj-xtrIT. The stereochemistry of the final energy-minimized model of AaHIT was examined by the program PROCHECK (40Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and found to be in agreement with the stereochemical parameters of proteins in the Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory (Upton, NY). Crude venom from 35B. judaicus scorpions was separated into 19 fractions by ion-exchange chromatography. Fraction IV, which was 19.5% of the crude venom and contained 1.5 mg of protein, produced an excitatory effect on blowfly larvae. Further fractionation of this component by gel-filtration chromatography yielded a major peak constituting 15.6% of the crude venom and containing 1.2 mg of protein. Final purification of the excitatory fraction was achieved by reverse-phase HPLC, yielding three major components, of which the 36-min fraction (31% acetonitrile) contained the toxic activity. The pure toxin (60 μg) constituted ∼0.8% of the total crude venom protein, and its mass was determined to be 8455 Da by mass spectrometry. The toxicity (ED50) of the purified toxin (Bj-xtrIT) to blowfly larvae was 4.1 ng/100 mg of body weight (TableI).Table IBioactivity of Bj-xtrIT variants and mutantsToxin variantED50ng/100 mg body weightBj-xtrIT.n4.1Bj-xtrIT.38E8.6Bj-xtrIT.38K8.6Bj-xtrIT.ΔC-terNDaND, not detectable.Bj-xtrIT.ΔS7649.3Bj-xtrIT.Δ(P75,S76)39.5Bj-xtrIT.Δ(I74–S76)NDBj-xtrIT.Δ(I73–S76)NDED50 values were determined for blowfly larvae (100 ± 20 mg). In the mutant Bj-xtrIT.ΔC-ter, the last seven amino acid residues have been replaced by a single glycine.a ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab ED50 values were determined for blowfly larvae (100 ± 20 mg). In the mutant Bj-xtrIT.ΔC-ter, the last seven amino acid residues have been replaced by a single glycine. The sequence of the 30 N-terminal amino acids of Bj-xtrIT was determined (Fig. 1), enabling synthesis of a degenerate oligonucleotide (primer 1) spanning the first seven amino acid residues. This primer was reacted with an oligo(dT) primer (primer 2) using the cDNA library of B. judaicus (see “Experimental Procedures”), resulting in a PCR product encoding most of Bj-xtrIT cDNA. Primer 3, designed according to the 3′-region of the PCR product, was reacted with the KS primer and the cDNA library as a template to generate the full-length cDNA encoding Bj-xtrIT. Two distinct cDNA sequences encoding toxins that vary at position 38 of the mature polypeptide (Bj-xtrIT.38K and Bj-xtrIT.38E) were identified in a multiple number of experiments. It is noteworthy that, in previous experiments (25Froy O. Sagiv T. Poreh M. Urbach D. Zilberberg N. Gurevitz M. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), four distinct genes encoding the excitatory toxin of Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus have been isolated. These results, together with the report of Bougis et al. (18Bougis P.E. Rochat H. Smith L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19259-19265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicate polymorphism among the genes encoding excitatory toxins (Fig. 1). An efficient bacterial expression system, employed previously to express an α-toxin (26Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Pelhate M. Adams M.E. Norris T. Zlotkin E. Gurevitz M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10215-10222Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and a depressant toxin (27Turkov M. Rashi S. Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Ben Khalifa R. Stankiewicz M. Pelhate M. Gurevitz M. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), was utilized in an attempt to produce an active recombinant excitatory toxin. Lqh-xtrIT-a cDNA (Fig. 1), encoding the excitatory toxin of L. quinquestriatus hebraeus (25Froy O. Sagiv T. Poreh M. Urbach D. Zilberberg N. Gurevitz M. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and Bj-xtrIT-a and Bj-xtrIT-b cDNAs (Fig. 1), encoding the aforementioned variants of B. judaicusexcitatory toxin, were engineered into a pET-11cK expression vector. Following isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction, the toxins, accumulating within E. coli inclusion bodies, were subjected to a denaturation/renaturation procedure (26Zilberberg N. Gordon D.

Folding conditions to obtain a functional toxin conformation were achieved by dissolving the denatured protein under conditions of various ammonium acetate concentrations (0–0.25 m), temperatures (4–37 °C), pH values (5.0–9.0), β-mercaptoethanol concentrations (0–0.5 m), and incubation periods (0–96 h). Both Bj-xtrIT variants eluted under similar conditions from the C18 column, resulting in a major active peak. However, negligible activity (as determined by the toxicity to blowfly larvae and the ability to displace the depressant toxin LqhIT2from its receptor-binding site on cockroach neural membranes) could be detected (data not shown) among a large number of Lqh-xtrIT isoforms. Rabbit anti-Lqh-xtrIT antibodies recognized Bj-xtrIT on Western blots, indicating common immunoreactive epitopes (data not shown). The overall yield of the recombinant Bj-xtrIT variants was 2.5 mg purified from 1 liter of an E. coli culture. The biological activity of the native (Bj-xtrIT-n) and recombinant (Bj-xtrIT.38E and Bj-xtrIT.38K) toxins was assessed by toxicity, binding, and electrophysiological assays. Injection of blowfly larvae provided ED50 values of 4.1, 8.6, and 8.6 ng/100 mg of body weight (Table I) for the three toxins, respectively. Injection of Bj-xtrIT.38K into S. littoralis lepidopteran larvae generated paralytic symptoms, with a PU50 value of 1.4 μg/100 mg of larva. Binding studies were performed using AaHIT and the depressant toxin LqhIT2 as competitive ligands. Bj-xtrIT competed with radioiodinated AaHIT for binding at an apparent affinity of ∼1 nm (Fig. 2 A), which is similar to the value obtained with AaHIT itself (11Gordon D. Jover E. Couraud F.

Biol. 1994; 24: 13-19Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Displacement of radioiodinated AaHIT from its receptor-binding site on the cockroach membrane preparation provided K ivalues of 1.0 ± 0.6 and 1.4 ± 0.2 nm for Bj-xtrIT.38K and Bj-xtrIT.38E, respectively (Fig. 2 B). To further establish the similarity in receptor recognition between Bj-xtrIT and AaHIT, competition curves were generated using125I-LqhIT2 (Fig. 2 B). The depressant toxin LqhIT2 was shown to bind to two non-interacting binding sites on insect neural membranes, a high affinity and low capacity receptor site and a low affinity site with high capacity. Only the high affinity site, shown to be located on insect sodium channels, is a target for binding competition with the excitatory toxin AaHIT (31Gordon D. Moskowitz H. Eitan M. Warner C.

For this purpose, we used Gi1α as a model dually acylated G-protein. We fused full-length Gi1α or its extreme NH2-terminal domain (residues 1–32 or 1–122) to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and analyzed the subcellular localization of these fusion proteins. We show that the first 32 amino acids of Gi1α are sufficient to target GFP to caveolin-enriched domains of the plasma membrane in vivo, as demonstrated by co-fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation with caveolin-1. Interestingly, when dual acylation of this 32-amino acid domain was blocked by specific point mutations (G2A or C3S), the resulting GFP fusion proteins were localized to the cytoplasm and excluded from caveolin-rich regions. The myristoylated but nonpalmitoylated (C3S) chimera only partially partitioned into caveolin-containing fractions. However, both nonacylated GFP fusions (G2A and C3S) no longer co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin-1. Taken together, these results indicate that lipid modification of the NH2-terminal of Gi1α is essential for targeting to its correct destination and interaction with caveolin-1. Also, a caveolin-1 mutant lacking all three palmitoylation sites (C133S, C143S, and C156S) was unable to co-immunoprecipitate these dually acylated GFP-G-protein fusions. Thus, dual acylation of the NH2-terminal domain of Gi1α and palmitoylation of caveolin-1 are both required to stabilize and perhaps regulate this reciprocal interaction at the plasma membrane in vivo.

This MGC motif is also shared by most members of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs),1 with the exception of Src itself and Blk (1Parenti M. Viganó M.A. Newman C.M.H. Milligan G. Magee A.I. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 2Koegl M. Zlatkine P. Ley S.C. Courtneidge S.A. Magee A.I. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This motif represents a consensus sequence that specifies the covalent attachment of a 14-carbon lipid (myristate) and a 16-carbon lipid (palmitate) to glycine 2 and cysteine 3, respectively. Moreover, some NRTKs may possess an additional palmitoylated cysteine (e.g. cysteine 5 in Lck and cysteine 6 in Fyn). Point mutations that prevent myristoylation and/or palmitoylation of Gα subunits and NRTKs drastically reduce the membrane avidity of these polypeptides, indicating that these lipid modifications act cooperatively to anchor these proteins to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane (3Alland L. Peseckis S.M. Atherton R.E. Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16701-16705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Grassie M.A. McCallum J.F. Guzzi F. Magee A.I. Milligan G. Parenti M. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because myristoylation is an irreversible modification, it has been proposed that it may play only a passive role as a hydrophobic handle or appendage for anchoring Gα subunits to membranes. In contrast, palmitoylation is a reversible modification and is therefore potentially regulatable, suggesting that it may play a more complex role in this process. In support of this hypothesis, palmitoylated Gzα and Gi1α are totally refractory to the GTPase-stimulating activities of the Gα-interacting protein and the regulator of G-protein signaling 4. Thus, palmitoylation may represent a mechanism for prolonging or potentiating G-protein signaling (5Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Moreover, palmitoylation is required for a productive interaction between G-protein-coupled receptors and Gα subunits. The myristoylated but palmitoylation-negative C3S mutant of Gi1α is unable to functionally couple with the α2A adrenergic receptor co-expressed in transfected COS-7 cells, even when the concentration of the mutant in the membrane is equivalent to that of wild type Gi1α (6Wise A. Grassie M.A. Parenti M. Lee M. Rees S. Milligan G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10620-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for these results is that the C3S mutant of Gi1α might be segregated into a distinct plasma membrane compartment that is separated from where the receptor is located. Recent evidence suggests that G-proteins are not homogeneously distributed throughout the cell surface. Instead, they may be concentrated within vesicle-like microdomains of the plasma membrane termed caveolae that exist in most cell types. It has been proposed that caveolae function as signaling depots where G-proteins and G-protein-coupled receptors, as well as other signaling molecules, are clustered (7Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 8Chang W.J. Ying Y. Rothberg K. Hooper N. Turner A. Gambliel H. De Gunzburg J. Mumby S. Gilman A.

Cell. 1997; 8: 2365-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Caveolae membranes fractionate as low buoyancy complexes on sucrose density gradients and are resistant to solubilization by nonionic detergents, such as Triton X-100, at low temperatures, due to their specialized lipid composition that is rich in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (10Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8044) Google Scholar, 11Brown R.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The position of caveolae within these gradients can be tracked by immunoblotting with specific antibodies directed against the caveolin family of proteins, which are the principal structural protein components of caveolae membranes. Caveolins interact with each other to form homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes, bind cholesterol, and interact with a variety of signaling molecules. For example, caveolin binding to Gα subunits is sufficient to maintain them in the inactive GDP-liganded conformation (12Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W.

According to the “caveolae signaling hypothesis,” Gα subunits may become activated when G-protein-coupled receptors are recruited to caveolae upon agonist stimulation (15de Weerd W.F.C.

Recent studies have indicated that point mutations that abolish myristoylation and/or palmitoylation prevent the association of Gi1α and other dually acylated proteins (such as NRTKs and endothelial nitric oxide synthase) with caveolin-enriched membrane fractions (18Song K.S.

This raises the possibility that NH2-terminal lipid modification can also specify membrane compartmentalization of dually acylated molecules within caveolae by acting as a targeting signal and/or through direct interactions with the lipid or protein components of caveolae (e.g.cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, or caveolins). To evaluate the potential role of the NH2-terminal region of Gα subunits and its lipid modification in targeting to the plasma membrane, we constructed a variety of lipid-modified and non-lipid-modified fusion proteins using GFP. We examined their subcellular distribution by immunofluorescence microscopy and their ability to co-fractionate and co-immunoprecipitate with caveolin-1 using transient expression in COS-7 or 293T cells. In addition, we studied the behavior of GFP fused to a short caveolin-binding domain (21Couet J. Li S.W. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar) recently identified within Gα subunits (specifically, residues 186–200 in Gi1α). The GFP cDNA was a gift of Dr. J. Pines (Wellcome/CRC Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom). It contains five mutations (F64L, S65T, V163A, I167T, and S175G) resulting in improved levels of fluorescence at 475 nm and is correctly folded at 37 °C. The cDNA encoding nonpalmitoylated caveolin-1 was as described previously (22Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6838-6842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Antibodies and their sources were as follows: (i) anti-caveolin-1 IgG (mAb 2297 and mAb 2234; gifts of Dr. J. R. Glenney, Transduction Laboratories); (ii) anti-GFP IgG (rabbit polyclonal antibody; CLONTECH); and (iii) rabbit anti-Gi1α polyclonal anti-serum (I1C; raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 160–169 of the Gi1α subunit). [9,10-3H]Palmitic acid (40–60 Ci/mmol) and [9,10-3H]myristic acid (40–60 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham. All other biochemicals used were of the highest purity available and were obtained from regular commercial sources. To generate GFP fusion proteins, the cDNA encoding GFP was placed at the 3′ end of the full-length rat Gi1α sequence (amino acids 1–355; FL-GFP) and of the following sequences of wild type rat Gi1α: (i) amino acids 1–32 (32aaWT-GFP), (ii) amino acids 1–122 (122aa-GFP), and (iii) amino acids 186–200 (caveolin-binding domain; CBD-GFP). Two additional constructs were generated by fusing GFP to the 1–32 NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of Gi1α: (i) 32aaG2A-GFP (mutation at the myristoylation site by replacing glycine 2 with alanine), and (ii) 32aaC3S-GFP (mutation at the palmitoylation site by substituting cysteine 3 with serine). Finally, GFP fusions were constructed in which the first 6 of 10 NH2-terminal amino acids of Gi1α were fused to GFP. All Gi1α-GFP fusion proteins were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplifications using the appropriate primers and subsequently subcloned in pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The correctness of intended base substitutions and the absence of unwanted mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. All DNA manipulations, including ligations, bacterial transformation, and plasmid purification, were carried out using standard procedures. COS-7 and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells (30–50% confluent) were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method and routinely analyzed 48 h after transfection. Cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated for 2 h in TBST (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) containing 2% powdered skim milk and 1% bovine serum albumin. After three washes with TBST, membranes were incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody (∼1,000-fold dilution in TBST) and for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgG (∼5,000-fold dilution). Proteins were detected using the ECL detection kit (Amersham). For cell fractionation, cells were harvested and resuspended in 0.5 ml of hypotonic buffer (5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEGTA, and 0.1 mm EDTA with 0.067 TIU/ml aprotinin (Sigma) and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) as protease inhibitors). Cell suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min, freeze/thawed, and homogenized with a Teflon/glass homogenizer. After a low speed centrifugation to remove unbroken cells and the nuclear pellet, samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 200,000 ×g at 4 °C in a Beckman TL100 centrifuge. The pellets (particulate fraction) and the acetone-precipitated supernatants (soluble fraction) were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and analyzed by Western blotting. After transfection, COS-7 cells were labeled for 4 h with [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (150 μCi/ml) or [9,10-3H]myristic acid (50 μCi/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, antibiotics, andl-glutamine. After washing with PBS, cells were lysed in 0.2 ml of 1% (w/v) SDS. After breakage of DNA by repeated pipetting and boiling for 4 min, 0.8 ml of the following mixture (Mix I) was added to each sample: 1.25% (w/v) Triton X-100, 190 mmNaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors as indicated above. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, 2 μl of GFP antibody were added to each supernatant, and the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Twenty-five μl of a 1:1 suspension of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in Mix II (4 parts of Mix I plus 1 part of 1% SDS) were added to each sample and incubated for ∼5 h at 4 °C with continuous rotation. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times for 15 min at 4 °C with Mix II (1 ml) and then washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and heated in Laemmli sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206276) Google Scholar) containing 20 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and gels were treated with 2,5-diphenyloxazole for fluorography (24Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 46: 83-88Crossref Scopus (5614) Google Scholar). To maximize sensitivity, we used a gel miniaturization procedure that involved soaking the 2,5-diphenyloxazole-impregnated gels after water washing in 50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000 (Sigma) at 70 °C for 15 min before drying (25Magee A.I. Wootton J. De Bony J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Dried gels were exposed on Kodak X-Omat AR-5 films at −70 °C. Transfected 293T cells grown on glass coverslips were washed three times with PBS and fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were rinsed with PBS and treated with 25 mmNH4Cl in PBS for 10 min at room temperature to quench free aldehyde groups. Cells were washed three times with PBS, and slides were mounted with Slow-Fade anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and observed under a Bio-Rad MR600 confocal microscope at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. COS-7 cells were scraped into 2 ml of 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid-buffered saline (MBS; 25 mm 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.5, and 0.15 m NaCl) containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Homogenization was carried out with 10 strokes of a loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose prepared in MBS and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–30% linear sucrose gradient was formed above the homogenate and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16–20 h in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). A light scattering band confined to the 15–20% sucrose region was observed that contained caveolin-1 but excluded most of the other cellular proteins. From the top of each gradient, 1-ml gradient fractions were collected to yield a total of 12 fractions. An equal volume of each gradient fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 10 mmTris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 60 mm octyl glucoside. Samples were pre-cleared for 1 h at 4 °C using protein A-Sepharose (20 μl; slurry, 1:1) and subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation at 4 °C using anti-caveolin-1 antibody (10 μl; mAb 2234) and protein A-Sepharose (30 μl; slurry, 1:1). After three washes with the immunoprecipitation buffer, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were then probed with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody. To date, all studies examining the role of lipid modification in the subcellular localization of Gi1α have relied on loss of function mutations in the context of the full-length Gi1α protein. To determine whether the acylated NH2 terminus of Gi1α is sufficient to direct membrane localization, we constructed fusion proteins consisting of full-length wild type Gi1α or the first 6, 10, 32, or 122 amino acids of Gi1α attached to the NH2 terminus of GFP, a normally cytosolic protein. Moreover, to define the role of fatty acylation in the specific subcellular localization of the 32aa-GFP chimera, the known palmitoylation site was mutated by replacing cysteine 3 with serine (32aaC3S-GFP). Likewise, the known myristoylation site, glycine 2, was mutated to alanine to generate a nonmyristoylated fusion protein (32aaG2A-GFP). An additional fusion protein (CBD-GFP) was engineered by attaching amino acids 186–200 of Gi1α to the NH2 terminus of GFP. Amino acids 186–200 of Gi1α contain the known caveolin-binding domain within Gi1 (21Couet J. Li S.W. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). The characteristics of all these engineered fusion proteins are detailed in Fig. 1. The cDNAs encoding wild type GFP and Gi1α-GFP fusions were individually transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. Their expression was analyzed by Western blotting of whole cell lysates using an anti-GFP polyclonal antibody. Fig. 2shows that 48 h after transfection, the cells produced comparable levels of all of the fusion proteins. In striking contrast, fusion proteins between GFP and the first 6 or 10 amino acids of Gi1α were expressed at very low levels (data not shown) and were not further characterized.Figure 2Expression of GFP and Gi1α-GFP fusion proteins in COS-7 cells. COS-7 were transiently transfected with different constructs using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in Laemmli sample buffer. Lysates were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Subsequently, fatty acylation patterns of the Gi1α-GFP fusions were determined by metabolic radiolabeling of transfected COS-7 cells with [3H]myristate or [3H]palmitate, followed by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with the GFP antibody. As expected, GFP alone was neither myristoylated nor palmitoylated (data not shown), whereas FL-GFP, 122aa-GFP, and 32aaWT-GFP incorporated both fatty acids (Fig. 3). The 32aaC3S-GFP fusion incorporated [3H]myristate but not [3H]palmitate, whereas 32aaG2A-GFP lacked both fatty acids, thus behaving as the corresponding full-length Gi1α G2A mutant, in which myristoylated glycine was required for efficient palmitoylation (26Galbiati F. Guzzi F. Magee A.I. Milligan G. Parenti M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of GFP and each of the Gi1α-GFP fusion proteins was next examined by fractionating postnuclear COS-7 cell homogenates into cytosolic (Fig.4, S) and membrane (Fig. 4,P) fractions by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 ×g. Each fraction was then analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-GFP antibody. As expected, GFP was entirely soluble, whereas FL-GFP, 122aa-GFP, and 32aaWT-GFP were primarily concentrated in the particulate fraction (80–90%; Fig. 4). In contrast, the amount of nonpalmitoylated 32aaC3S-GFP was greatly increased within the soluble fraction (>50%; Fig. 4). An even greater shift was observed with 32aaG2A-GFP, which is neither myristoylated nor palmitoylated, because ∼90% of this protein was detected in the soluble fraction, as was CBD-GFP (Fig. 4). We conclude from these experiments that the NH2-terminal Gi1α sequence is sufficient to target a cytosolic protein to cellular membranes and that myristic and palmitic acids cooperatively affect membrane binding. The results observed with CBD-GFP fusion suggest that binding to caveolin-1 and anchorage to cellular membranes are expressed by distinct domains of the Gi1α protein. It is worth noting that the particulate fraction in this assay contains total cell membranes, including plasma membrane and intracellular membranes. Thus, changes in the distribution among various cell membrane compartments will not be appreciated unless a morphological analysis of transfected cells is performed. To investigate the intracellular localization of the various Gi1α-GFP fusion proteins, we took advantage of the spontaneous fluorescence of GFP. 293T cells expressing wild type GFP and the Gi1α-GFP fusions were fixed and examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy. The micrographs presented in Fig.5 illustrate that although GFP was cytosolic, it gained a plasma membrane localization after fusion with full-length Gi1α or its NH2-terminal 122- and 32-amino acid sequences. Interestingly, FL-GFP, 122aa-GFP, and 32aaWT-GFP exhibited the same pattern of cellular distribution as wild type Gi1αvisualized by indirect immunofluorescence staining of 293T cells with a Gi1α anti-serum. In contrast, nonacylated 32aaG2A-GFP showed a diffuse cytosolic staining (Fig. 5), whereas nonpalmitoylated 32aaC3S-GFP exhibited a hybrid distribution, as illustrated by the staining of both cell edges and the cytoplasm. The fluorescence associated with the CBD-GFP fusion was diffuse, thus confirming its localization primarily within the cytosol, in agreement with our biochemical experiments (see Fig. 4). Mock-transfected 293T cells showed no detectable fluorescence (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that the first 32 amino acids of Gi1αcontain information that is sufficient to specify a plasma membrane localization, provided that fatty acylation is successfully completed. Recently, it has been shown that heterotrimeric G-protein subunits, as well as a number of other signaling molecules, are concentrated within a distinct subcompartment of the plasma membrane known as caveolae (7Sargiacomo M.

Due to their high content of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, caveolar membranes are resistant to extraction at 4 °C by nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100 and float on bottom-loaded sucrose density gradients. Using a well-defined procedure that combines both of these physicochemical properties to separate low density, Triton-insoluble membranes containing caveolin-1 (7Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) from the bulk of cellular membranes and cytosolic proteins, we analyzed by Western blotting the content of GFP, Gi1α, and Gi1α-GFP fusions in sucrose density gradient fractions obtained from transfected COS-7 cells. Caveolin-1, a structural protein of caveolar membranes, was used as a marker protein for the distribution of these detergent-resistant membrane domains. As shown in Fig.6 A, the bulk of cellular proteins, including soluble polypeptides, were concentrated in the bottom, high density fractions (40% sucrose layer of the gradient;lanes 9–12), whereas caveolin-1 immunoreactivity was exclusively detected in the caveolae fractions (∼10–20% sucrose layer of the gradient; lanes 4 and 5). Fig. 6 B shows that FL-GFP, 122aa-GFP, and 32aaWT-GFP fusions exhibited a distribution pattern equivalent to that of wild type Gi1α, distributing between both caveolin-containing fractions as well as fractions 9–12 (lanes 9–12). The palmitoylation-defective 32aaC3S-GFP fusion had a similar distribution; however, compared with the wild type, significantly less of the fusion protein was detected in the low density caveolae fractions and more was present in the soluble, higher density fractions, as might be anticipated by its increased solubility (see Fig. 4). Accordingly, fully soluble 32aaG2A-GFP and CBD-GFP fusions were completely excluded from the caveolin-containing fractions and were concentrated at the bottom of the gradient, behaving essentially as soluble GFP alone. These observations suggest that amino acids 1–32 of Gi1α, which contain the myristoyl and palmitoyl moieties, encode the complete address signal for subcellular targeting of the Gi1α polypeptide. Caveolin interacts directly with Gα subunits, preferentially recognizing their inactive conformation (13Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that caveolin functions as a scaffolding protein to spatially organize certain caveolin-interacting proteins within caveolae membranes. The scaffolding domain of caveolin consists of a 20-amino acid stretch (residues 82–101) within the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain of caveolin-1 (27Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). A consensus sequence for caveolin binding has been deduced in many caveolae-associated polypeptides, including Gα subunits (21Couet J. Li S.W. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Lipid modification of Gα subunits is not required for interaction with caveolin-1 in vitro (13Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar); however, it remains unknown whether lipid modification of Gα subunits is required for interaction with caveolin-1 in vivo. In this study, we wanted to examine whether the NH2terminus of Gi1α, although located a distance from the caveolin-binding motif (residues 186–200 of Gi1α), might influence interactions with caveolin-1 in vivo. For this purpose, we immunoprecipitated lysates of COS-7 cells transfected with various Gi1α-GFP fusions with a specific mAb probe that recognizes the extreme NH2 terminus of caveolin-1 and analyzed the composition of these precipitates by Western blotting with a GFP-specific antibody. Fig. 7 A shows that FL-GFP, 122aa-GFP, and 32aaWT-GFP clearly co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin-1. In striking contrast, mutant fusions 32aaC3S-GFP, 32aaG"

Proteins known to bind the PEPCK CRE include the CRE-binding protein (CREB) and members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family. We took two different approaches to determine which of these proteins provides the accessory factor activity for the glucocorticoid response from the PEPCK CRE. The first strategy involved replacing the CRE of the PEPCK promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid (pPL32) with a consensus C/EBP-binding sequence. This construct, termed pΔcreC/EBP, binds C/EBPα and β but not CREB, yet it confers a nearly complete glucocorticoid response when transiently transfected into H4IIE rat hepatoma cells. These results suggest that one of the C/EBP family members may be the accessory factor. The second strategy involved co-transfecting H4IIE cells with a pPL32 mutant, in which the CRE was replaced with a GAL4-binding sequence (pΔcreGAL4), and various GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) fusion protein expression vectors. Although chimeric proteins consisting of the GAL4 DBD fused to either CREB or C/EBPα are able to confer an increase in basal transcription, they do not facilitate the glucocorticoid response. In contrast, a fusion protein consisting of the GAL4 DBD and amino acids 1–118 of C/EBPβ provides a significant glucocorticoid response. Additional GAL4 fusion studies were done to map the minimal domain of C/EBPβ needed for accessory factor activity to the glucocorticoid response. Chimeric proteins containing amino acid regions 1–84, 52–118, or 85–118 of C/EBPβ fused to the GAL4 DBD do not mediate a glucocorticoid response. We conclude that the amino terminus of C/EBPβ contains a multicomponent domain necessary to confer accessory factor activity to the glucocorticoid response from the CRE of the PEPCK gene promoter.

This unit consists of (from 5′ to 3′) two accessory factor elements (AF1 and AF2), two glucocorticoid receptor-binding sites (GR1 and GR2), a third accessory element (AF3), and the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) (see Fig. 1). The glucocorticoid response decreases by 50–60% when any one of the accessory elements is mutated, and it is abolished when any combination of two are disrupted (6Mitchell J.A. Noisin E.L. Hall R.K.

Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) or chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF) confers accessory factor activity by binding to the AF1 element, and COUP-TF binds to and confers activity from the AF3 element (7Scott D.K.

Members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) families bind to AF2, but only the latter provide accessory factor activity for the glucocorticoid response from this element (10O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.-C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wang J.-C. Strömstedt P.-E. O'Brien R.M.

An intact CRE is also required for a complete glucocorticoid response, because deletion of this element results in a 50% decrease of the glucocorticoid response (12Imai E. Miner J.N. Mitchell J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5353-5356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CRE is therefore a multifunctional element, as it is also necessary for basal transcription and the cAMP response (4Liu J. Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

We have previously reported that GR physically interacts with CREB in vitro and that both C/EBP family members and CREB bind to the PEPCK gene CRE (12Imai E. Miner J.N. Mitchell J.A. Yamamoto K.R.

The aim of the present study was to determine which protein(s) provides accessory factor activity for the glucocorticoid response through the CRE. A very good glucocorticoid response was retained when the CRE was replaced with a consensus C/EBP-binding site, suggesting that C/EBP family members contribute accessory activity. A PEPCK promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene construct, in which the CRE was replaced by a GAL4-binding site, was co-transfected with GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD)-fusion protein expression vectors to determine which protein(s) potentiates the glucocorticoid response from the CRE. We found that C/EBPβ mediates accessory factor activity through the CRE, whereas C/EBPα and CREB do not. Furthermore, the amino-terminal domain of C/EBPβ is required for accessory factor activity. The conditions of the EMSA have been described previously (22O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Yamasaki T. Noisin E.L. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30419-30428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the EMSA are listed in Table I. The TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was used for the in vitro translation of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and CREB using the plasmids pGEM-C/EBPα, pGEM-C/EBPβ, and pET-CREB, respectively (22O'Brien R.M.

Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). pPL32 was used as a template in polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) to create mutations in the CRE. The nucleotide sequences of all the PCR primers used in this study are listed in Table I. A downstream primer (CAT, Table I) and the CRE mutant primers, C/EBP or GAL4, were used in PCRs to generate two megaprimers (24Giniger E. Varnum S.M. Ptashne M.

The megaprimers were gel purified and used with an upstream primer (Table I, PLF) in a second PCR to generate a fragment that, after digestion withHindIII andBglII, was ligated into the reporter plasmid pPLF to generate the plasmids pΔcreC/EBP and pΔcreGAL4, respectively. pRSV-GR, a glucocorticoid receptor expression vector, was obtained from Dr. Keith R. Yamamoto (University of California, San Francisco, CA). pBR322, a standard cloning vector, was obtained from Promega. The plasmid pSG424 expresses the yeast transcription factor GAL4 DBD driven by the SV40 promoter (27Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The plasmid pcDNA1-GAL4-CREBΔbZIP(4–283), which encodes a GAL4·CREB fusion protein that lacks the basic region and leucine zipper (bZIP) domain of CREB, was a gift from Dr. Richard A. Maurer (28Sun P. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7041-7044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). An EcoRI/XbaI fragment from this vector, which encodes the CREBΔbZIP fusion protein, was subcloned into theEcoRI/XbaI sites of the pSG424 plasmid to produce the mammalian expression vector pGAL4·CREB 283. Dr. Maurer also provided RSV-PKI and RSV-PKImut vectors that encode the heat-stable inhibitor of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and a mutant of the inhibitor, respectively (29Day R.N. Walder J.A. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 431-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GAL4·C/EBPα 358, 317, 108 and GAL4·C/EBPβ 276, 118, 84, GAL4 DBD-C/EBPα and GAL4 DBD-C/EBPβ fusion protein expression vectors were gifts from Dr. Peter F. Johnson (30Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To make GAL4·C/EBPβ 52–118 and GAL4·C/EBPβ 85–118, the DNA fragments that encode amino acids 52–118 and 85–118 in the C/EBPβ gene were amplified by the reverse transcription-PCR method. One of two upstream primers, β52 or β85, and a downstream primer, β118, were used in these reactions (Table I). Total RNA was isolated from H4IIE cells using the acid guanidine-phenol-chloroform method (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was performed at 37° C for 1 h in a 50-μl reaction mixture that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 35 units of RNase inhibitor, 1 mm dNTPs, 50 units of AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega) in the presence of 1.5 μg of total RNA and 25 pmol of the β118 oligonucleotide. PCR was carried out using the β118 oligonucleotide and either the β52 or the β85 oligonucleotide as primers (Table I). Briefly, a 100-μl reaction mixture contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 2 mm dNTPs, 10 pmol of each primer, 10 μl of the reverse transcription reaction as a template, and 5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The PCR conditions used were as follows: denaturation for 3 min at 98° C; 5 cycles of 1 min at 98° C, 30 s at 55° C, and 30 s at 72° C; and another 25 cycles of 1 min at 98° C, 30 s at 58° C, and 30 s at 72° C. The amplified DNA fragments were digested with EcoRI andXbaI, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and then subcloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of the plasmid pGAL4·C/EBPβ 118. The DNA sequence of each construct was verified by dideoxy sequencing. All of the plasmids used in this study were purified by the CsCl/ethidium bromide density gradient ultracentrifugation method. H4IIE cells, a rat hepatoma cell line, were cultured as described previously (21Peterson D.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). HeLa cells, a human cervical carcinoma cell line, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. For the analysis of the glucocorticoid response in H4IIE cells, 10 μg of reporter plasmid and 5 μg of pRSV-GR, with or without GAL4-fusion protein expression vectors, were co-transfected using the calcium-phosphate method, as described previously (6Mitchell J.A. Noisin E.L. Hall R.K. O'Brien R.M. Imai E. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar). Four hours after transfection, the cells were subjected to a 20% Me2SO shock for 4 min and then maintained in serum-free DMEM for an additional 16 h. This additional incubation was not performed for the transfections involving PKI and PKImut. The medium was then changed to serum-free DMEM, with or without 0.5 μmdexamethasone, and the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. A titration using 0.5, 1, or 2.5 μg of the expression vector was performed when the cells were co-transfected with the GAL4-fusion protein expression vectors. The greatest dexamethasone response was employed to calculate the fold induction. The measurement of CAT activity was carried out as described previously (32Nordeen S.K. Green III., P.P. Fowlkes D.M. DNA. 1987; 6: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The GAL4-fusion protein expression vectors were transfected into HeLa cells to determine the relative expression of the GAL4-fusion proteins. The medium was changed 16 h after transfection, and after an additional 32 h, nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Schreiber et al. (33Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). EMSAs or Western blots were used to measure the relative expression of these proteins (28Sun P. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7041-7044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). CREB and C/EBP family members are the only proteins from rat liver nuclear extracts that bind specifically to the PEPCK CRE (22O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Yamasaki T. Noisin E.L. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30419-30428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), making them obvious candidates for providing accessory factor activity to the glucocorticoid response. Transient transfections of H4IIE cells were performed using wild type (pPL32) and mutated PEPCK promoter/CAT reporter plasmids (Fig. 1). In these experiments, pPL32 conferred about a 10-fold glucocorticoid response, which is taken as the maximal, or 100%, response (Fig. 1, top row, right). In contrast, when the PEPCK CRE was replaced with a GAL4-binding site (pΔcreGAL4) (Fig. 1, middle row), the basal transcriptional activity and the glucocorticoid response decreased to 61 and 45% of the wild type activity, respectively. Both responses are equivalent to those observed when either an internal deletion or a block mutation of the CRE is made (Ref. 12Imai E. Miner J.N. Mitchell J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5353-5356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). However, when the CRE was replaced with a consensus C/EBP-binding site (pΔcreC/EBP) (Fig. 1,bottom row), basal transcription increased 2-fold, and the absolute dexamethasone response was substantially greater than that conferred by the wild type promoter (cf.Fig. 1, top row). When corrected for the increase in basal expression, however, the dexamethasone response from pΔcreC/EBP was 71% that of wild type (Fig. 1, compare bottom row withtop two rows). These results suggest that a member of the C/EBP family confers accessory factor activity to the glucocorticoid response. EMSAs were performed to confirm that the wild type PEPCK CRE and the two mutant sequences described above bind the appropriate transcription factors (Fig. 2). As expected, no protein-DNA complex was formed when the wild type CRE (TableI, CREwt) oligonucleotide was used as the32P-labeled probe and incubated with an unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 2, lane 1). However, a protein-DNA complex was formed when this probe was mixed with a reticulocyte lysate programmed to express CREB (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). The addition of a specific antiserum directed against CREB abolished the complex, whereas a nonspecific antiserum directed against Tyk2 did not affect the formation of the complex (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and4). In competition experiments, the formation of this complex was prevented by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of an unlabeled CREwt oligonucleotide but not by equivalent amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotides that contained binding sites for C/EBP, GAL4, or USF (Table I; Fig. 2 A, lanes 5–8). The formation of the complex was not prevented even by the addition of a 500-fold molar excess of the unlabeled C/EBP oligonucleotide (data not shown); furthermore, no shifted complex was observed when the in vitro translated CREB protein was incubated with a labeled C/EBP oligonucleotide (Table I; data not shown). Together, these data reaffirm that although CREB binds specifically to the PEPCK CRE, it binds to neither the consensus C/EBP site nor the GAL4 DNA-binding site. Therefore, in the context of pΔcreC/EBP, CREB does not provide accessory factor activity to the glucocorticoid response (cf. Fig. 1, bottom row). Shifted protein-DNA complexes were formed when the labeled CREwt oligonucleotide was incubated in binding reactions that contained either in vitro translated C/EBPα or C/EBPβ (Fig. 2,B and C, respectively, lane 2). These complexes were supershifted by specific antisera directed against C/EBPα or C/EBPβ, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C, lane 3). By contrast, nonspecific antiserum directed against Tyk2 did not affect the formation of the C/EBP-DNA complexes (Fig. 2,B and C, lane 4). Additionally, the C/EBPα antiserum did not cross-react with in vitro translated C/EBPβ, nor did the C/EBPβ antiserum cross-react with C/EBPα (data not shown). In competition experiments, the formation of these complexes was prevented by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled CREwt and C/EBP oligonucleotides, but not an equimolar amount of either the GAL4 or USF E-box oligonucleotides (Table I; Fig.2, B and C, lanes 5–8). Together, these results indicate that the CREwt oligonucleotide is bound by CREB, C/EBPα, and C/EBPβ; that the C/EBP oligonucleotide is bound by C/EBPα and C/EBPβ but not CREB; and that the GAL4 oligonucleotide does not bind any of these proteins in vitro. H4IIE cells were co-transfected with the pΔcreGAL4 reporter plasmid and various GAL4 DBD fusion protein expression vectors to determine whether C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or CREB (Fig. 3 A) can confer accessory factor activity to the glucocorticoid response. The α and β isoforms of the C/EBP family were tested because both proteins are highly expressed in the liver and bind to the consensus C/EBP-binding site that confers partial accessory activity from the CRE (cf. Fig. 1, bottom row). The cellular expression of the GAL4 fusion proteins was found to be essentially equivalent, as determined by Western blotting or EMSA (Refs. 28Sun P. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7041-7044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and 30Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F.

A, linear representations of the transcription factors that are able to bind the PEPCK CRE (i.e. C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and CREB) are depicted above. C/EBPα contains two activation domains (AD1 and AD2) and a carboxyl-terminal bZIP domain. C/EBPβ contains an amino-terminal activation domain (AD) composed of three subdomains, two repressor domains (RD1 and RD2), and a carboxyl-terminal bZIP domain. CREB contains three activation domains (Q1, P-box,and Q2) and a carboxyl-terminal bZIP domain. B,the reporter constructs used for the GAL4-fusion experiments are pΔcreGAL4 and (GAL4)5E1bCAT. pΔcreGAL4 is a mutant of pPL32 in which the CRE was replaced with a GAL4-binding sequence. (GAL4)5E1bCAT is a heterologous CAT reporter plasmid driven by an E1b promoter into which five tandem GAL4-binding sites have been inserted. C,pΔcreGAL4 was co-transfected with various GAL4-fusion protein expression vectors into rat hepatoma (H4IIE) cells to determine basal and glucocorticoid-induced PEPCK transcription. The GAL4-fusion constructs are depicted on the left. The wild type PEPCK-CAT plasmid (pPL32) was used as an internal control for all experiments, and its CAT activity was set at 100%. The left data columnshows the basal CAT activity mediated by each construct relative to pPL32. The middle data column shows the glucocorticoid-induced response of each construct relative to pPL32. To ascertain basal transcriptional activity mediated by the GAL4-fusion proteins in a heterologous context, 10 μg of the (GAL4)5E1bCAT reporter construct and 0.2 μg of the GAL4-fusion protein expression vectors were co-transfected into H4IIE cells. CAT activity from the H4IIE cells co-transfected with the (GAL4)5E1bCAT reporter construct and the GAL4 DBD was set at 1. All values shown represent the mean ± S.E. of three or more experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When H4IIE cells were co-transfected with pΔcreGAL4 (Fig.3 B) and the GAL4 DBD expression vector, the basal and glucocorticoid responses were 78 and 42% of those conferred by the wild type pPL32 construct, respectively (as shown in Fig. 3C, row 1). These responses are similar to those obtained when the reporter plasmid alone was transfected (data not shown). It is important to reiterate the fact that a glucocorticoid response of 42% is equivalent to that obtained when mutations are made that abolish accessory factor activity from the CRE (Ref. 12Imai E. Miner J.N. Mitchell J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5353-5356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; data not shown). When GAL4·C/EBPα 358, a vector that expresses the full-length C/EBPα·GAL4-DBD fusion protein, was co-transfected with pΔcreGAL4, basal transcription was restored to that of wild type, but the glucocorticoid response was unaffected at 50% of the control (Fig. 3 C, row 2). These results were expected because the full-length C/EBPα·GAL4 DBD fusion protein contains two bZIP domains that are known to interfere with transactivation (30Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In fact, when this construct was co-transfected with the (GAL4)5E1bCAT heterologous reporter (34Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), a construct that contains a TATA box and five tandem GAL4-binding sites (Fig.3 B), transcription activity was almost the same as that provided by the GAL4 DBD alone (Fig. 3 C, rows 1 and 2, right column). Therefore, we next tested GAL4·C/EBPα 317, which lacks the leucine zipper domain, and GAL4·C/EBPα 108, which lacks both the basic region and the leucine zipper domain. When these constructs were co-transfected into H4IIE cells with the pΔcre"
https://openalex.org/W1963928863,"NE-dlg/SAP102, a neuronal and endocrine tissue-specific membrane-associated guanylate kinase family protein, is known to bind to C-terminal ends of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B (NR2B) through its PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domains. NE-dlg/SAP102 and NR2B colocalize at synaptic sites in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, and their expressions increase in parallel with the onset of synaptogenesis. We have identified that NE-dlg/SAP102 interacts with calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The binding site for calmodulin has been determined to lie at the putative basic alpha-helix region located around the src homology 3 (SH3) domain of NE-dlg/SAP102. Using a surface plasmon resonance measurement system, we detected specific binding of recombinant NE-dlg/SAP102 to the immobilized calmodulin with a Kd value of 44 nM. However, the binding of Ca2+/calmodulin to NE-dlg/SAP102 did not modulate the interaction between PDZ domains of NE-dlg/SAP102 and the C-terminal end of rat NR2B. We have also identified that the region near the calmodulin binding site of NE-dlg/SAP102 interacts with the GUK-like domain of PSD-95/SAP90 by two-hybrid screening. Pull down assay revealed that NE-dlg/SAP102 can interact with PSD-95/SAP90 in the presence of both Ca2+ and calmodulin. These findings suggest that the Ca2+/calmodulin modulates interaction of neuronal membrane-associated guanylate kinase proteins and regulates clustering of neurotransmitter receptors at central synapses."

In contrast to ILT2, individual human KIRs bind major histocompatibility complex class I molecules expressed by a particular human leukocyte antigen locus. When KIRs bind major histocompatibility complex class I on a target cell or are bound by anti-KIR Ig, they become tyrosine-phosphorylated, recruit SHP-1, and impair both the release of calcium from intracellular stores and the influx of extracellular calcium (7Burshtyn D.N.

We also show that gp49B1, when tyrosine-phosphorylated, binds SHP-1 and SHP-2 recruited from the cytoplasm of mBMMCs and that gp49B1-mediated inhibition of FcεRI-driven activation is reduced in SHP-1-deficient mBMMCs. That inhibition of mast cell activation by gp49B1 is accompanied by decreases in both the release of calcium from intracellular stores and the subsequent influx of extracellular calcium supports the role of SHP-1 in the proximal transmission of the counter-regulatory signal.DISCUSSIONWe have established that gp49B1 initiates a counter-regulatory series of cellular responses within 60 s of coligation to cross-linked FcεRI on the surface of mast cells. Inasmuch as exocytosis and lipid mediator generation are complete 120– 150 s after FcεRI cross-linking in mBMMCs (39Razin E. Mencia-Huerta J. Stevens R.L. Lewis R.A. Liu F. Corey E.J. Austen K.F. J.

Med. 1983; 157: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the rapid recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 to gp49B1 is consistent with the enzyme initiating an effective silencing pathway for the immediate-onset response of the mast cell to FcεRI cross-linking. The known functions of SHP-1 (26Campbell K.S. Dessing M. Lopez-Botet M. Cella M. Colonna M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) are compatible with the capacity of gp49B1 to inhibit the release of calcium from intracellular stores and the influx of extracellular calcium. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that an endogenous mast cell membrane protein can down-regulate IgE-mediated mast cell activation in nontransformed cells via the actions of recruited SHP-1.The participation of gp49B1 ITIMs in the inhibition of mast cell activation was established by mutagenesis of their tyrosine residues in the context of native gp49B1. Inasmuch as the rat anti-gp49B1 does not bind to RBL-2H3 cells, this rat mucosal mast cell line (17Seldin D.C. Adelman S. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. Hein A. Caulfield J.P. Woodbury R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3871-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) was optimal for transfection with wild-type and mutated mouse gp49B1 molecules. In these transfectants, the native extracellular domain of wild-type and mutant gp49B1 bound by anti-gp49B1 was coligated to FcεRI sensitized with rat IgE by means of F(ab′)2 mouse anti-rat IgG, as described previously for mBMMCs (9Katz H.R. Vivier E. Castells M.C. McCormick M.J. Chambers J.M. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10809-10814Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and utilized here for studies of calcium flux and SHP-1 deficiency in mBMMCs (Figs. 5 and 6). The coligation of wild-type, transfected gp49B1 to cross-linked FcεRI inhibited the exocytosis achieved by the cross-linking of FcεRI alone (Fig. 1). Mutation of the tyrosines in both ITIMs abolished the ability of coligated gp49B1 to inhibit β-hexosaminidase release, whereas mutation of the tyrosines individually caused a partial loss of inhibitory capacity (Fig. 1). When the PIR-B cytoplasmic domain was expressed as a chimeric receptor by transfection of RBL-2H3 cells, single tyrosine mutations in either of the two most downstream ITIMs (Tyr-794 and Tyr-824) resulted in either no appreciable effect (10Blery M. Kubagawa H. Chen C.-C. Vely F. Cooper M.D. Vivier E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2446-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) or partial loss of inhibitory function with each mutation (11Yamashita Y. Ono M. Takai T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4042-4047PubMed Google Scholar); in yet another profile of effects, there was a partial loss of inhibition of calcium flux with mutation of the Tyr-794 ITIM and no loss for mutation of the Tyr-824 ITIM in a B cell line (12Maeda A. Kurosaki M. Ono M. Takai T. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The differences in these findings, each of which resulted from studies that used a single concentration of activating agonist, may relate to our findings that both the inhibitory capacity of gp49B1 ITIMs bearing single ITIM mutations and the SHP-1 independence of the native gp49B1 counter-regulatory mechanism decrease as the amount of IgE utilized for activation via FcεRI on the cell surface increases.The ability of endogenous mast cell tyrosine kinases to phosphorylate native gp49B1 in mBMMCs was established by inhibiting tyrosine phosphatases pharmacologically with pervanadate (Fig. 2). When native gp49B1 was phosphorylated by exposing mBMMCs to pervanadate, SHP-1 and SHP-2 were coprecipitated detectably with tyrosine-phosphorylated gp49B1, as assessed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting (Fig. 3). Only SHP-1 coprecipitated detectably with gp49B1 after coligation with FcεRI under conditions that inhibit mast cell activation (Fig. 4), although it is possible that SHP-2 and/or SHIP may associate in amounts below their respective levels of immunochemical detection. The association of SHP-1 with native gp49B1 was transient, being detected only within 60 s of cross-linking of FcεRI to itself with coligation to gp49B1. Although time course data have not been reported for the binding of SHP-1 to any of the human or mouse relatives of gp49B1, their cross-linking to themselves, coligation to an activating receptor, or binding to a natural ligand leads to their association with SHP-1 when assessed 1–2 min later (7Burshtyn D.N.

That the association of SHP-1 with gp49B1 is substantially reduced from the maximum by 60 s after coligation with FcεRI (Fig. 4) may indicate that tyrosine-phosphorylated gp49B1 is a substrate for SHP-1, inasmuch as certain phosphorylated ITIM peptides can be substrates for SHP-1 in broken cell assays (40Burshtyn D.N. Yang W. Yi T. Long E.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13066-13072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The ability of gp49B1 to inhibit FcεRI-directed exocytosis (Fig. 5) in SHP-1-deficient mBMMCs was absent at high inputs of IgE, indicating that SHP-1 has a central role in mediating gp49B1-dependent inhibition of mast cell activation. However, there was substantial but incomplete gp49B1-dependent inhibition in the SHP-1-deficient mBMMCs at lower amounts of IgE that were still sufficient for near-maximal or maximal IgE-dependent exocytosis, which may reflect residual levels of SHP-1 activity but more likely reveals that SHP-1 is not the only transmitter of gp49B1-mediated inhibition of mast cell activation.The intracellular calcium flux associated with the cross-linking of FcεRI to itself was markedly suppressed by coligation of FcεRI to gp49B1. Both the initial rate of release reflecting intracellular stores and the magnitude of calcium increase were markedly attenuated (Fig. 6 A). In the presence of EGTA, the time of the peak calcium increase after FcεRI cross-linking decreased by ∼40 s (Fig.6 B), and the magnitude of total increase in calcium was markedly diminished, indicating that the peak at ∼100 s in the absence of EGTA reflects the sum of two overlapping curves representing the release of intracellular calcium and the influx of extracellular calcium, respectively. In the presence of EGTA, the cross-linking of FcεRI to itself with coligation to gp49B1 provided virtually no calcium flux, again indicating that gp49B1 mediated inhibition of the release of calcium from intracellular stores. The inhibition of NK cell-mediated target cell lysis directed through KIRs and their associated SHP-1 is also characterized by an absence of calcium release from intracellular stores and lack of influx of extracellular calcium (26Campbell K.S. Dessing M. Lopez-Botet M. Cella M. Colonna M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).Type IIb1 and IIb2 Fc receptors for IgG (FcγRIIb1 and FcγRIIb2), which are the products of alternative splicing of mRNA from the FcγRIIβ gene (41Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Dixon F.J. Advances in Immunology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 1-127Google Scholar), are Ig superfamily members that do not exhibit significant amino acid sequence homology with gp49B1 (9Katz H.R. Vivier E. Castells M.C. McCormick M.J. Chambers J.M. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10809-10814Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) but that nonetheless possess a single ITIM. We and others have shown that these receptors are expressed on mouse mast cells (42Benhamou M. Bonnerot C. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3071-3077PubMed Google Scholar, 43Katz H.R. Arm J.P. Benson A.C. Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3412-3417PubMed Google Scholar), and the coligation of the FcγRIIb species with cross-linked FcεRI suppresses mast cell mediator release through a process that depends on ITIM phosphorylation (38Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 44Daëron M. Malbec O. Latour S. Arock M. Fridman W.H. J. Clin.

Immunity. 1995; 3: 635-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In contrast to gp49B1, the inhibition of mBMMCs activation by FcγRIIb1 and FcγRIIb2 proceeds through the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase SHIP, resulting primarily in inhibition of FcεRI-induced sustained influx of extracellular calcium, with little attenuation of the early increase in free cytosolic calcium (38Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). This difference highlights a distinction between the two inhibitory receptors in mast cells and may provide the mast cell with a degree of selectivity in its inhibitory processes. In addition, the fact that mouse mast cells express several ITIM-bearing receptors of the Ig superfamily (gp49B1, FcγRIIb1/b2, and PIR-B) is consistent with the hypothesis that these cells are controlled by an intricate network of inhibitory receptors. Inasmuch as gp49B1 and PIR-B have two and six Ig-like domains, respectively, the specificity of their SHP-1-transduced inhibition of exocytosis is likely regulated by their different counterligands. The cross-linking of the high affinity Fc receptor for IgE (FcεRI)1 on the surface of mast cells activates intracellular signaling pathways that lead to exocytosis of preformed secretory granule components, generation of membrane-derived lipid mediators, and elaboration of immunoregulatory and proinflammatory cytokines. Through the release of their array of bioactive mediators, mast cells have an unusually high proinflammatory potential and contribute to host defense in animal models (1Echtenacher B. Männel D.N.

In addition to FcεRI, mouse mast cells express on their surface gp49B1 (4Katz H.R. LeBlanc P.A. Russell S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have shown that when rat IgE bound to FcεRI on mouse interleukin-3-dependent, bone marrow-derived mast cells (mBMMCs) is both cross-linked to itself and coligated with rat anti-gp49B1 mAb bound to gp49B1, by means of F(ab′)2 mouse anti-rat IgG (heavy and light chain reactive), the release of secretory granule- and lipid-derived mediators is inhibited (9Katz H.R.

As defined by ALIGN amino acid homology analysis, gp49B1 belongs to a family of receptors that has immunoregulatory potential (9Katz H.R. Vivier E. Castells M.C. McCormick M.J. Chambers J.M.

In the mouse, the sole other member of this homology-based family (14Katz H.R. Marone G. Asthma and Allergic Diseases. Academic Press, London1998: 97-105Crossref Google Scholar) that bears an ITIM is PIR-B (also termed p91), which has six Ig-like domains and is expressed as mRNA transcripts in mouse mast cells (15Hayami K.

We present the characterization of the annetocin cDNA. Sequence analyses of the deduced precursor polypeptide revealed that the annetocin precursor is composed of three segments: a signal peptide, an annetocin sequence flanked by a Gly C-terminal amidation signal and a Lys-Arg dibasic processing site, and a neurophysin domain, similar to other oxytocin family precursors. The proannetocin showed 37.4–45.8% amino acid homology to other prohormones. In the neurophysin domain, 14 cysteines and amino acid residues essential for association of a neurophysin with a vasopressin/oxytocin superfamily peptide were conserved, suggesting that the Eisenia neurophysin can bind to annetocin. Furthermore, in situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that the annetocin gene is expressed exclusively in neurons of the central nervous system predicted to be involved in regulation of reproductive behavior. These findings confirm that annetocin is a member of the vasopressin/oxytocin superfamily.

Pept. 1998; 73: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). They are classified into the VP and OT families based on the amino acid residue present at position 8: the VP family peptides contain a basic amino acid, and the OT family peptides contain a neutral amino acid at this position (1Acher R. Kobayashi H. Bern H.A. Urano A. Neurosecretion and the Biology of Neuropeptides. Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo1985: 11-25Google Scholar, 2Acher R. Regul.

Pept. 1998; 73: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Both the VP and OT family peptides are present in all vertebrate species except the cyclostomes, which have only the VP-related peptide vasotocin (2Acher R. Regul.

Pept. 1998; 73: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The difference in the polarity of this amino acid residue is believed to enable the VP and OT peptides to interact with the respective receptor. The structural organization of the precursor polypeptides of neurohypophysial hormones is highly conserved in all vertebrates (2Acher R. Regul. Pept. 1993; 45: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 3Acher R. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1996; 102: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Hoyle C.H.V. Regul. Pept. 1998; 73: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The preprohormones are also structurally divided into the same two classes. The mammalian VP family precursors are composed of four regions: a signal peptide, a nonapeptide, a neurophysin, and a copeptin domain. The architecture of non-mammalian precursors is quite similar, except that the copeptin is not generated due to the absence of post-translational cleavage in the precursor. Thus, a non-mammalian neurophysin contains a C-terminal extended domain (2Acher R. Regul. Pept. 1993; 45: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 3Acher R. Gen. Comp.

The OT family precursors are organized similarly, but they completely lack copeptin(-like) domains, except for the isotocin precursor of the white sucker fish, which also contains an extension of the C-terminal region (2Acher R.

The peptides from invertebrates are all amidated at the C terminus and share five residues, namely Cys1, Asn5, Cys6, Pro7, and Gly9 (Table I) (4Hoyle C.H.V. Regul. Pept. 1998; 73: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Annetocin has been isolated from the lumbricid earthworm Eisenia foetida. The primary sequence Cys-Phe-Val-Arg-Asn-Cys-Pro-Thr-Gly-NH2 is homologous to sequences of OT-related peptides (18Oumi T. Ukena K. Matsushima O. Ikeda T. Fujita T. Minakata H. Nomoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and injection of annetocin into the earthworm and leech results in induction of egg-laying behavior (19Oumi T. Ukena K. Matsushima O. Ikeda T. Fujita T. Minakata H. Nomoto K. J. Exp. Zool. 1996; 276: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The similarity of not only the primary structure but also the reproductive function implies that annetocin is a member of the OT family. However, whether annetocin belongs to the superfamily remains to be concluded since the organized structure of an annetocin precursor polypeptide has not been characterized. In invertebrates, the structure of the Lymnaea Lys-conopressin precursor has been identified, demonstrating that the typical architecture of the precursor of the VP/OT superfamily peptide is also highly conserved in molluscs (20Van Kestern R.E. Smit A.B. Dirks R.W. De With N.D. Geraerts W.P.M. Joosse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4593-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This is the only identification of the invertebrate VP/OT superfamily precursor, and thus, the phylogenetic relationship of the VP/OT superfamily among invertebrates has not been understood. To determine the feature of the precursor polypeptide of the annelid VP/OT-related peptide and to investigate the molecular evolution or divergence of the VP/OT superfamily in invertebrates, we isolated and characterized the annetocin precursor polypeptide cDNA. In this report, we present indisputable evidence for the existence of the VP/OT superfamily in Annelida. The annetocin precursor, very much like other precursors of the OT family, consists of the typical three segments, i.e. a signal peptide, annetocin, and a neurophysin-like domain with 14 cysteine residues positioned identically to those of other neurophysins. The proannetocin displays amino acid sequence identities between 37.4 and 45.8%. A comparative study of amino acid sequences of prohormones also revealed the presence of amino acid residues crucial for interaction of a neurophysin with a hormone peptide in the Eisenianeurophysin domain. Furthermore, in situ hybridization directly detected expression of the annetocin gene in neurons of the subesophageal ganglion, which is known to be the central nervous tissue of the earthworm, confirming the specific synthesis of annetocin in the central nervous system as a neuropeptide. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the precursor structure of the invertebrate OT-related peptide and also the first identification of cDNA encoding the VP/OT-related peptide from Annelida, the most primitive species from which a VP/OT-related peptide has ever been isolated.Table IThe invertebrate VP/OT-related peptides and species from which the peptide was characterized (13Cruz L.J. de Santos V.

All nucleotides were ordered from Sawady Technology. Frozen partial earthworm heads (1 g) were pulverized by grinding under liquid nitrogen. The ground tissues were dissolved in 10 ml of TRizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol. All PCR amplifications were carried out in a reaction mixture containing Taq polymerase (EXTaq polymerase (Takara Shuzo) or rTaq DNA polymerase (TOYOBO)) and 200 μm dNTP in a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 2400). First strand cDNA was synthesized with the oligo(dT)-anchor primer supplied in the 5′/3′-RACE kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and amplified using the anchor primer and the first degenerate primer, TG(T/C)TT(T/C)GTI(A/C)GIAA(T/C)TG(T/C)CC (where I represents inosine), corresponding to the N-terminal part of annetocin, Cys-Phe-Val-Arg-Asn-Cys-Pro. First-round PCR products were reamplified using the anchor primer and the second degenerate primer, GTI (A/C)GIAA(T/C)TG(T/C)CCIACIGGIGG, corresponding to the C-terminal part of annetocin, Val-Arg-Asn-Cys-Pro-Thr-Gly-Gly, where the last Gly was regarded as a C-terminal amidation signal. Both first- and second-round PCRs consisted of 30 cycles for 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 51 °C, and 2.5 min at 72 °C (5 min for the last cycle). The second-round PCR products were subcloned into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA inserts of the positive clones were amplified by PCR using universal M13 primers. Template cDNA was synthesized using a primer complementary to nucleotides 416–435 (ATTCCTTCGACAGCGCAGAC), followed by dA-tailing of the cDNA using dATP and terminal transferase (Boehringer Mannheim). The tailed cDNA was amplified using the oligo(dT)-anchor primer and the gene-specific primer 1 (TCGACAGAT-GGTTCTCGAGG, complementary to nucleotides 349–368), followed by reamplification of the first-round PCR products using the anchor primer and the gene-specific primer 2 (GTGTTGACGAAGCAGAAGAAG, complementary to nucleotides 309–328). Both first- and second-round PCRs were performed for 30 cycles consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C. The second-round PCR products were subcloned, and the inserts were amplified as described in 3′-RACE. All nucleotide sequences were determined using Big-Dye sequencing kits (Perkin-Elmer) and an automated DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Model 373A) and analyzed on GENETYX-MAC software (Software Development). Universal M13 primers or gene-specific primers were used to sequence both strands. A full-length digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled annetocin precursor cDNA was synthesized using a DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and was used as a probe for Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was separated on a denaturing formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gel and fixed onto Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by UV irradiation. Hybridization and detection were carried out according to the manufacturer's standard procedure (Boehringer Mannheim). RNA size was estimated using DIG-labeled RNA molecular markers (Boehringer Mannheim). An earthworm head was dissected and incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 0.9% NaCl) at 4 °C overnight. After washing five times with 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 0.1% Tween 20 at 4 °C for 30 min, the fixed head was dehydrated in ethanol and benzene and embedded in 96% polyester wax (BDH). Transverse sections 6-μm thick were cut, arranged on 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated slides (Mathunami), and dried for 5 h at 50 °C and further overnight at room temperature. The sections were deparaffinized in xylene (2 × 5 min, room temperature) and rehydrated in ethanol and PBS, followed by successive treatment with a 10 μg/ml proteinase K solution (Nakalai Tesque; 10 min, room temperature), PBS (3 × 5 min, room temperature), 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (10 min, room temperature), PBS (3 × 5 min, room temperature), 0.2 n HCl (10 min, room temperature), PBS (3 × 5 min, room temperature), 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1m triethanolamine HCl buffer (pH 8.0) (10 min, room temperature), and PBS (3 × 5 min, room temperature). The sections were then incubated for 2 h at 50 °C in prehybridization medium containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate (Sigma), 1% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim), 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate (pH 4.5)), and 50 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA. To prepare a sense or antisense probe, 53-mer oligonucleotides complementary or identical to a preproannetocin cDNA located between nucleotides 152 and 204 were tailed at the 3′-terminus by DIG-11-dUTP using a DIG oligonucleotide tailing kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 50 °C in hybridization medium containing a 1 pmol/ml concentration of each labeled probe. Hybridized sections were washed with 50% formamide and 2× SSC (2 × 20 min, room temperature), 2× SSC (2 × 20 min, 50 °C), and 0.2× SSC (2× 20 min, 50 °C). After incubation in blocking buffer diluted with washing buffer prepared from the DIG Wash and Block Buffer Set (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at room temperature, slides were incubated in a 1:1000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin Fab (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, slides were washed in washing buffer (2 × 20 min, room temperature); covered with a chromogen mixture consisting of 100 mm Tris (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 337.5 μg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, and 175 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate; and kept at room temperature in the dark until sufficient color had developed (∼36 h). Staining was stopped by washing with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA. In an attempt to obtain annetocin precursor polypeptide cDNA fragments, we performed a 3′-RACE experiment using degenerate primers corresponding to the N-terminal part of annetocin (Cys-Phe-Val-Arg-Asn-Cys-Pro) and the anchor primer (see “Experimental Procedures”). To increase abundance and specificity, the first-round PCR products were further amplified with degenerate primers corresponding to the C-terminal part of annetocin (Val-Arg-Asn-Cys-Pro-Thr-Gly-Gly) and the same anchor primer. Here, the C-terminal amide group was thought to be derived from a C-terminal Gly residue that is well known as the typical amidation signal. Electrophoresis of the second-round PCR mixture revealed a single product of ∼0.5 kilobases (data not shown). Sequencing of the subcloned second-round PCR products showed that all clones had essentially identical nucleotide sequences, except for minor differences in the 3′-terminal sequence, probably attributable to utilization of the alternate polyadenylation signal AATAAA and various lengths of the poly(A) tract. The predicted amino acid sequence comprised a cysteine-rich domain preceded by the endoproteolytic dibasic sequence Lys-Arg after a partial annetocin sequence derived from the second-round PCR primers, indicating that an annetocin precursor might be organized similarly to precursors of the VP/OT superfamily. To determine the 5′-end sequence, we performed 5′-RACE using specific primers for the clone (see “Experimental Procedures”). A single product of ∼0.3 kilobases (data not shown) was obtained and sequenced after subcloning and amplification as described for the 3′-RACE products and contained two putative ATG initiation codons in addition to a TGA stop codon upstream of the first ATG codon. PCR products amplified using different polymerases had identical nucleotide sequences, confirming that these cDNA clones were not generated by artifacts. By combining nucleotide sequences determined by 3′- and 5′-RACE, the entire cDNA sequence encoding a preproannetocin was identified. Fig. 1shows the complete sequence of the longest cDNA. The annetocin precursor cDNA is composed of 668 nucleotides containing a 417-base pair single open reading frame flanked by a short 5′-untranslated sequence of 58 base pairs and a 3′-untranslated sequence of 193 base pairs followed by various lengths of poly(A) tail. The open reading frame region begins with two putative start codons present at positions 59 and 86 and terminates with a stop codon at position 473. Both putative initiation codons conform to the Kozak rule (AAAATGG and AACATGA) (22Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). Two polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) were found in the 3′-untranslated region at positions 637 and 647. Nucleotide sequence analysis of all clones indicated that the second polyadenylation signal was used relatively more frequently than the first one; however, the biological significance of this remains to be elucidated. Northern blot analysis of total RNA using a DIG-labeled preproannetocin cDNA as a probe detected a single band of ∼0.8 kilobases (Fig.2 A) even after longer exposure (data not shown), suggesting that the annetocin gene produces a single transcript. The apparent migration of the 0.8-kilobase sequence was well in accordance with the estimated length of the cDNA, confirming that the longest cDNA sequence identified by combination of 3′- and 5′-RACE includes a full-length nucleotide sequence encoding an annetocin preprohormone.Figure 2Northern blot analysis of total RNA (A), schematic representation of the annetocin precursor polypeptide (B), and hydropathy plot analysis of the predicted precursor (C). InA, total RNA was extracted from the anterior part of the earthworm, and ∼25 μg of RNA was subject to Northern blot hybridization using a DIG-labeled annetocin cDNA probe. RNA molecular markers are shown on the left in kilobases (kb). In B, the hydrophobic leader sequence is labeledS. The annetocin sequence and neurophysin-like domain are represented by the hatched and black bars, respectively. The endoproteolytic sites are shown asblack lines. In C, the plot was generated according to the method of Kyte and Doolittle (21Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) using GENETYX-MAC software.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The open reading frame region encodes a 139-residue polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of ∼14.6 kDa. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the structural organization of the annetocin precursor polypeptide was quite homologous to that of the VP/OT-related preprohormones: the precursor was composed of a signal peptide, a nonapeptide, and a neurophysin domain, as shown in Fig.2 B. The annetocin transcript was predicted to be translated with the Met present at position 1 or 10 since the nucleotide sequences surrounding the two start codons are entirely consistent with the Kozak rule as described above. Hydropathy plot analysis of preproannetocin identified the N-terminal sequence as the most hydrophobic (Fig.2 C), suggesting that this region serves as a signal peptide. The cleavage site of the signal peptide may be the Ala32–Cys33 bond (or Ala23–Cys24 if the Met at position 10 is used as the initiating signal), as seen in other precursor polypeptides of the VP/OT superfamily. Furthermore, this prediction is supported by the −3,−1 rule (23von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). The annetocin sequence CFVRNCPTG, flanked by Gly as an amidation signal and the typical dibasic processing sequence Lys-Arg, was found to follow a signal sequence. The following moiety showed the properties of a neurophysin domain. The striking feature of this neurophysin domain is that 14 cysteine residues are positioned almost identically to those in the neurophysin domains of other VP/OT-related prohormones (Fig. 3). This result suggests that an essential tertiary structure of theEisenia neurophysin domain is also highly conserved because disulfide pairings by 14 cysteine residues in the neurophysin domain are believed to play a significant role in conformation essential for interaction with a hormone peptide (27Burman S.

A copeptin-like region (another typical domain in the prohormones of the VP family, but not in those of the OT family) is entirely absent in preproannetocin since a TGA stop codon is found immediately after the fourteenth cysteine. These findings indicate that the principal architecture of VP/OT superfamily preprohormones is also highly conserved in Annelida and that a precursor polypeptide of annetocin is structurally closer to precursors of OT-related peptides since a C-terminal extension is not seen in the preprohormones. In addition, no consensus sequence for any other post-translational modification such as glycosylation or phosphorylation was found in the precursor polypeptide. The amino acid sequence of the annetocin prohormone is aligned with the sequences of other species' prohormones of the VP/OT superfamily in Fig. 3. The neurophysin domain of the annetocin prohormone includes the longest sequence between the cleavage site Lys-Arg and the third conserved cysteine residue (position 41). Furthermore, seven amino acids are present between the ninth and tenth cysteines of the invertebrate prohormones, whereas the vertebrate counterparts contain five or six amino acids in the corresponding region. Generally, lower animal prohormones seem to include longer sequences in these regions. Comparative sequence analyses showed that several amino acids such as Arg23, Gly34, Glu67, Pro73, and Gly93 in the annetocin prohormone are completely conserved in the neurophysin domains of any species, in addition to the 14 cysteine residues. Other than the nonapeptide sequences flanked by the Gly C-terminal amidation signal and the endoproteolytic Lys-Arg site, only the Glu67-Asn68-His69-Leu70-Ser71-Thr72-Pro73region is relatively homologous to the corresponding regions in vertebrates and Lymnaea. The total amino acid sequence of the annetocin prohormone is 37.4–45.8% homologous to the sequences of other prohormones (Table II). Interestingly, the similarity of the annetocin prohormone to theLymnaea Lys-conopressin prohormone is not significantly distinct from the similarities to the prohormones of vertebrates. This result is somewhat surprising because we expected the amino acid homology of the invertebrate prohormone to another relatively close invertebrate or lower vertebrate (for example, cyclostomes) prohormone to be much higher than to advanced vertebrate prohormones. However, the highest and lowest similarities were found with the bovine vasopressin prohormone (45.8%) and the white sucker vasotocin I prohormone (37.4%), respectively. These findings suggest that the amino acid sequence of the invertebrate VP/OT superfamily prohormone may show a remarkable interphyletic difference that is not correlated with phyletic distance.Table IIAmino acid sequence homology of proannetocin to other vasopressin/oxytocin superfamily prohormonesSpecies (peptide)Homology%Lymnaea(Lys-conopressin)42.1Bovine (vasopressin)45.8Bovine (oxy"

We report here that the 14-3-3ζ protein interacts with Cas in the yeast two-hybrid assay. We also found that the two proteins associate in mammalian cells and that this interaction takes place in a phosphoserine-dependent manner, because treatment of Cas with a serine phosphatase greatly reduced its ability to bind 14-3-3ζ. Furthermore, the Cas-14-3-3ζ interaction was found to be regulated by integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Thus, when cells are detached from the extracellular matrix, the binding of Cas to 14-3-3ζ is greatly diminished, whereas replating the cells onto fibronectin rapidly induces the association. Consistent with these results, we found that the subcellular localization of Cas and 14-3-3 is also regulated by integrin ligand binding and that the two proteins display a significant co-localization during cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that 14-3-3 proteins participate in integrin-activated signaling pathways through their interaction with Cas, which, in turn, may contribute to important biological responses regulated by cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix.

Upon ligand binding, integrins recruit a number of signaling proteins to sites of cell contact with the ECM known as focal adhesions (3Jockusch B.M. Bubeck P. Giehl K. Kroemker M. Moschner J.

As a result, several focal adhesion proteins are rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated and engaged in protein-protein interactions with signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. One of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that orchestrates the assembly of these signaling complexes is p130Cas (Cas), a docking protein originally identified as the major tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate in v-Crk and v-Src transformed cells (4Kanner S.B.

Cas also contains a serine-rich domain (designated here as SR) (see Fig. 1); however, despite the fact that Cas is known to undergo serine phosphorylation in response to integrin-mediated cell adhesion (Ref. 16Schlaepfer D.D.

To get insight into the function of the SR region in Cas, we set forth to identify the proteins that directly bind Cas within this domain. We report here that among these molecules are the 14-3-3 proteins. Members of the 14-3-3 family form homo- or heterodimeric complexes that mediate interactions between diverse components of signaling pathways, including the serine/threonine kinase c-Raf-1 (17Fu H.

In many cases, serine phosphorylation of the binding partner is crucial in regulating the interaction with 14-3-3 (28Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar), and by using phosphoserine-oriented libraries, two different binding consensus motifs for 14-3-3 were identified (29Yaffe M.B.

Through the various interactions, the 14-3-3 proteins have been proposed to regulate enzymatic activity of their binding partners, to serve as clustering proteins bringing together enzymes and substrates, and to function as “chaperone” molecules that stabilize structural conformations of the associated proteins (26Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Our results reported here suggest a role for 14-3-3 proteins in integrin signaling pathways and provide new insights into their functional significance in intracellular signaling events. The yeast two-hybrid cloning vectors pVP16 and pBTM116, the DNA construct pBTM116/lamin, and the yeast strain L40 have been described in (30Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Hollenberg S.M. Bartley P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, UK1997: 29-42Google Scholar). The “bait” construct used for the two-hybrid screening, pBTM116/Cas(SR), contains the SR domain of Cas encompassing the amino acids 520 to 712 (Fig. 1) (numbering according to Sakai et al. (7Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar)), and was generated by cloning the corresponding cDNA fragment in frame with the LexA coding sequence into the vector pBTM116. The DNA constructs encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of the 14-3-3 isoforms η, β, ς, and ζ have been described by Yaffeet al. (29Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). The mammalian expression plasmids for the GST-tagged Cas constructs GST/Cas (coding for the full-length wild-type Cas) and GST/CasΔ(SD) (coding for a form of Cas in which the substrate domain, amino acids 213–514, has been deleted) are described by Mayer et al. (31Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The 14-3-3ζ/Myc cDNA contains the c-Myc epitope at the amino-terminal domain of the 14-3-3ζ protein and was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Single point mutations and DNA deletions were performed using polymerase chain reaction techniques and the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The CasΔ(SR) construct was prepared by deleting the DNA sequences encoding for the residues 520 to 712 of the full-length Cas cDNA (Fig. 1), followed by cloning into the mammalian expression vector pSSRα. The yeast two-hybrid interaction screen was performed essentially as described by Vojtek et al. (30Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Hollenberg S.M. Bartley P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, UK1997: 29-42Google Scholar). The plasmid pBTM116/Cas(SR) was introduced into the L40 yeast strain, total protein extracts were prepared from individual colonies (32Golemis E.A. Brent R. Bartley P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, UK1997: 43-72Google Scholar), and the expression of LexA-Cas(SR) was assessed by immunoblotting (anti-LexA antibody) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A L40 yeast clone expressing LexA-Cas(SR) was transformed with a murine whole embryo library (embryonic day 9.5–10.5) constructed in the plasmid pVP16 (33Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The resulted transformants (2 × 106) were selected using histidine prototrophy and analyzed for β-galactosidase activity. Positive yeast clones were selected and expanded in selective medium for the expression of the gene Leu2 (pVP16-vector). The specificity of the protein-protein interactions was assessed by transforming the selected yeast clones with the plasmids pBTM116/Lamin or pBTM116/Cas(SR). Plasmid DNA from positive clones was isolated, sequenced, and compared with the nucleotide data base at the National Library of Medicine (www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The yeast two-hybrid protein-protein interactions were also evaluated by quantifying the β-galactosidase activity in liquid cultures usingo-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside (Sigma) (34Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells used in the study were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing glutamine Pen-Strep (Irvine Scientific) and 10% fetal calf serum (Tissue Culture Biologicals). For cell adhesion experiments, Rat-1 cells were grown to 90% confluency as a monolayer, serum-starved for 18 h, and detached with trypsin-EDTA treatment followed by treatment with 0.5 mg/ml of trypsin inhibitor. Cell suspensions were incubated in 0.5% bovine serum albumin, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C with continuous rotation for the indicated time periods and plated onto dishes precoated with 10 μg/ml of fibronectin (FN) or with 2 mg/ml of poly-l-lysine (2 mg/ml). Cell transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cell cultures were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed on ice for 5 min (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 units/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C, normalized for the protein content and subjected to immunoprecipitation or affinity association experiments (described later). Immunoprecipitations were carried out with a commercial anti-Cas antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with a rabbit polyclonal antibody generated in the laboratory against the SR domain of Cas and protein A-Sepharose, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Immunoblotting was performed with an anti-Cas antibody (Transduction Laboratories), anti-14-3-3β antibody (Santa Cruz), or anti-c-Myc antibody (Calbiochem). Immunoreactive bands were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or protein A and enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate) (Pierce). In vitro association experiments were carried out with GST fusion proteins containing the full-length 14-3-3 molecule. The fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described (13Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates prepared as described above were normalized for the protein content and incubated with ∼10 μg of GST alone or GST fusion protein, which had been immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Protein complexes were allowed to associate for 4 h at 4 °C, recovered by centrifugation, and washed with lysis buffer. Complexes were analyzed by standard SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting techniques. Affinity purification of GST-tagged Cas proteins from mammalian cell lysates with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out by using a similar procedure, except that the lysis buffer contained 400 mm NaCl, and the washing buffer contained 500 mm NaCl. Cas was immunoprecipitated from Rat-1 cells using an anti-Cas polyclonal antibody, protein complexes were recovered by centrifugation, equilibrated with 50 μl of phosphatase reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 2 mm MgCl2, 140 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and treated with 30 units of calf alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C. The protein complexes were then eluted with 1% SDS (5 min at 95 °C), diluted 1:10 with lysis buffer, incubated with GST/14-3-3 fusion proteins immobilized on Sepharose and analyzed with GST/14-3-3 fusion proteins as above. Parallel control experiments omitted calf alkaline phosphatase. Rat-1 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with commercial antibodies against 14-3-3β (Santa Cruz), vinculin (Bio-Rad) and Cas (Transduction Laboratories). Anti-14-3-3 and anti-vinculin antibodies were diluted in 5% fetal calf serum, PBS, and applied to cells that had been incubated with 5% fetal calf serum, PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The anti-Cas antibody was diluted in 0.5% bovine serum albumin, PBS and used without preblocking the cells. The immunocomplexes were detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate- or tetramethyl rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit/anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), FluoroGuard Antifade mounting reagent (Bio-Rad), and visualized by digital confocal immunofluorescence (Zeiss LSM-410 confocal microscope). Images were captured with a Zeiss Axiovert 405 m inverted microscope with an attached CCD camera (100x Plan-Neofluare). The amino acids 520–712 of the docking protein Cas encompass a region that is characterized by the presence of multiple serine phosphorylation consensus motifs, the SR domain (Fig.1). Importantly, this region is significantly conserved in Cas-homologous proteins, including Efs/Sin (35Ishino M. Ohba T. Sasaki H. Sasaki T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2331-2338PubMed Google Scholar, 36Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and HEF1/Cas-L (37Law S.F. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 38Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This information prompted us to investigate the possibility that the S domain of Cas might participate in intracellular signaling by mediating protein-protein interactions. The cDNA coding for the SR domain of Cas, LexA-Cas(SR), was used as a bait, pBTM116-LexA-Cas(SR) for two-hybrid screen of a mouse embryonic library (2 × 106 transformants) subcloned into pVP16. Six of the total of 67 selected clones were found to interact in a specific manner with the LexA-Cas(SR) bait. Plasmid DNA from these clones was isolated and sequenced. DNA data base analysis demonstrated that clone number 11 contained a fragment corresponding to the amino acids 1 to 138 of the mouse 14-3-3ζ protein fused in frame with the VP16 protein. This clone was renamed as pVP16/14-3-3(11). As shown in Fig. 2, yeast transformed with the pBTM116/Cas(SR) and pVP16/14-3-3(11) plasmids expressed significant β-galactosidase activity and grew in conditional media lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. The clone pVP16/14-3-3(11) contains DNA sequences (∼60 base pairs) that correspond to the 5′-untranslated region of the mouse 14-3-3ζ cDNA that were deleted to generate the construct pVP16/14-3-3(DUT). Expression of this protein together with the SR domain of Cas, pBTM116/Cas(SR), resulted in a similar transactivation as compared with that obtained with the original clone isolated by two-hybrid screen, pVP16/14-3-3(11) (Fig. 2), confirming a direct interaction between the 14-3-3ζ peptide and Cas(SR) domain. The specificity of the interaction between Cas(SR) and 14-3-3ζ in yeast was further demonstrated by the lack of interaction of pVP16/14-3-3 with other domains of Cas or lamin (Fig. 2). To examine whether 14-3-3ζ interacts with the full-length Cas protein in mammalian cells, a GST fusion protein coding for 14-3-3ζ was used in affinity association, or pull-down, experiments. Analysis of lysates prepared from COS-1, HeLa, and 293 human embryonic kidney cell lines demonstrated that Cas interactsin vitro with 14-3-3ζ (Fig.3 A). The association was more prominent in HeLa and 293 cell lysates, suggesting that the interaction might be regulated by cellular processes, such as post-translational protein modifications. Pull-down studies using GST fusion proteins of various 14-3-3 isoforms showed that Cas efficiently associates with the 14-3-3β and η isoforms as well (Fig. 3 B, left panel). Interestingly, the interaction observed between Cas and 14-3-3ς was consistently lower than that between the other isoforms, despite the fact that equal amounts of the different GST fusion proteins were used in the experiments (Fig. 3 B, right panel). We next investigated whether 14-3-3 proteins interact with Cas in vivo. To this end, GST-tagged forms of Cas, GST/Cas, or GST/CasΔ(SD), or an untagged form of wild-type Cas were expressed alone or in combination with 14-3-3ζ-Myc in HeLa (Fig.4 A) or COS-1 cells (Fig.4 B). Protein lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection and the GST-tagged Cas proteins were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose (Fig. 4, A and B). The protein complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-14-3-3β antibodies that cross-react with all 14-3-3 isoforms (Fig.4 A), or with an anti-Myc antibody that recognizes the expressed Myc-tagged 14-3-3ζ protein (Fig. 4 B). As shown in Fig. 4, the recombinant 14-3-3ζ-Myc protein migrates with an apparent molecular mass of ∼35 kDa, which is slightly larger than that of the endogenous 14-3-3 proteins (∼32–33 kDa). Both endogenous and recombinant 14-3-3 proteins were found to associate with the wild-type GST/Cas protein in vivo. A mutant form of Cas in which the substrate domain has been deleted, GST/CasΔ(SD), associated with the 14-3-3 proteins to a similar extent (Fig. 4 A). Because this mutant form does not become phosphorylated on tyrosine at a detectable level (39Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), our results suggest that the Cas-14-3-3 interaction is not dependent on or regulated by the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of Cas. To rule out the possibility that the association of 14-3-3 with the Cas constructs was mediated by binding to the GST tag and not to Cas, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-Cas antibodies. Endogenous 14-3-3 proteins readily co-immunoprecipitated with the endogenous Cas proteins from Rat-1 cell lysates thereby confirming that 14-3-3 is a component of the Cas protein complex in vivo (Fig. 4 C). A charge-reversal mutation of lysine-49 in the peptide binding groove within the 14-3-3 molecule is thought to disrupt the binding of 14-3-3 to the serine-phosphorylated target proteins (see “Discussion”) and indeed, this mutation has been shown to greatly decrease the association of 14-3-3 with Raf-1 and exoenzyme S (40Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We found that the association between Cas and 14-3-3ζ is also critically dependent on interactions mediated by this lysine residue. Parallel pull-down experiments using the wild-type GST/14-3-3ζ or the GST/14-3-3ζ K49E mutant demonstrated that Cas associates exclusively with the wild-type protein, despite the fact that similar amounts of bacterially expressed fusion proteins were used in the studies (Fig.5 A). These data prompted us to further investigate the requirement of serine phosphorylation in Cas for the association with 14-3-3ζ. To this end, Cas was immunoprecipitated from Rat-1 cell lysates, treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and subjected to an in vitroassociation analysis with GST/14-3-3ζ and control GST fusion proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 5 Bshows that phosphatase treatment of Cas completely abolished the interaction with the GST/14-3-3ζ. The decrease in association was not because of proteolysis of Cas, as equivalent amounts of Cas protein were present in all the samples (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that phosphoserine residue(s) of Cas are an important determinant for the binding to 14-3-3. These results together with the yeast two-hybrid interaction of the serine-rich domain of Cas with 14-3-3ζ directed us to investigate whether the SR domain in Cas is the major binding site for 14-3-3 proteins in the context of full-length Cas. Therefore, we generated a Cas mutant with the entire SR domain deleted, CasΔ(SR). Pull-down experiments showed that deletion of this domain of Cas greatly diminished, but did not completely eliminate, the interaction with GST/14-3-3ζ. Despite the fact that the protein expression levels of the recombinant proteins and the endogenous Cas were comparable (Fig. 5 C), GST/14-3-3ζ readily interacted with the endogenous full-length Cas and with the mutant CasΔ(SD), but to a lesser degree with the recombinant CasΔ(SR) protein (Fig. 5 C). These results demonstrate that the SR domain of Cas is a major structural determinant mediating the association of Cas to 14-3-3 proteins and that additional, yet-to-be identified 14-3-3 binding domains appear to be present in Cas outside of this region. Cas is known to become not only tyrosine-, but also serine-phosphorylated in response to integrin-mediated cell adhesion (16Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possibility that the Cas-14-3-3 interaction would be regulated by cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. Pull-down experiments demonstrated that Cas and 14-3-3 readily interacted in Rat-1 cells that had been cultured as a monolayer in 10% fetal calf serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or serum-starved for 18 h (Fig. 6). Upon cell detachment, the Cas-14-3-3 interaction was remarkably reduced in a time-dependent manner. When the Rat-1 fibroblasts were replated onto FN substratum, to which the cells adhere in an α5β1 integrin-dependent manner, the Cas-14-3-3 interaction was restored. A gradual increase in the association was observed as early as 20 min after replating of the cells, with a complete recovery to steady-state levels within 4 h after replating (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, cell adhesion to poly-l-lysine, to which cells adhere in an integrin-independent manner, failed to stimulate Cas-14-3-3 interaction (Fig. 6 B). Together, these results demonstrate the requirement for integrin ligand binding in the signaling pathway that induces the Cas-14-3-3 association. Previous studies have demonstrated that Cas localizes in membrane ruffles (39Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and focal adhesions (41Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) during the initial attachment of cells to matrix proteins, whereas, in stationary cells, the majority of Cas protein localizes in the cytosol (42Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Honda H. Ogawa S. Ueno H. Suzuki T. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3884-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We examined the subcellular distribution of Cas and 14-3-3 proteins using digital confocal immunofluorescence (Fig. 7). Rat-1 cells were kept in suspension for 40 min followed by replating on FN for 20 min or 4 h. During the initial steps of cell adhesion (20 min), lamellipodia extensions were observed in the spreading cells. Simultaneous two-color confocal immunofluorescence showed that 14-3-3 proteins (Fig.7 A) accumulate at the edges of the membrane ruffles where Cas (Fig. 7 D) was highly concentrated. Upon merging the images, a remarkable co-localization of 14-3-3 with Cas (Fig.7 G) was observed in the lamellipodia structures (yellow). After 4 h of attachment to FN, lamellipodia structures had disappeared, and focal adhesion contacts were well organized as defined by immunostaining with anti-vinculin antibodies, a marker for focal adhesions (43Singer I.I.

Type I PI kinases phosphorylate the D3 position of the inositol ring and are therefore referred to as PI 3-kinases (17Welters P. Takegawa K. Emr S.D. Chrispeels M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The proteins encoded by these genes have now been grouped into two distinct subfamilies, 1.1 and 1.2, based on sequence and structure similarities (20Gehrmann T. Heilmeyer Jr., M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Subfamily 1.1 is represented by proteins of 68–122 kDa and subfamily 1.2 by proteins of 200–230 kDa (with the exception of human PI4Kα, which is a 97-kDa protein (21Wong K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28878-28884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The comparison of the primary structures of these proteins has enabled the identification of several conserved domains. All PI 4-kinases possess a catalytic domain of about 230 amino acid residues, which constitute the C-terminal part of those proteins, and a so-called lipid kinase unique (LKU) domain of about 100 residues, the location of which varies between the different isoforms. The larger isoforms as well as PI4Kα (21Wong K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28878-28884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) all contain a PH domain that separates the LKU and catalytic domains in these proteins. In addition, it was recently noted that yeast PIK1 and a soluble PI 4-kinase from rat have a region in common that could not be detected in any other PI 4-kinases (22Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Studies conducted with plant tissues have demonstrated the presence of PI 4-kinase activity in plasma membranes (23Sommarin M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 958: 268-278Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the cytosol (24Okpodu C.M. Gross W. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93 Suppl. 1: 63Google Scholar), the cytoskeleton (13Xu P. Lloyd W. Staiger C.J. Drobak B.K. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 941-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and nuclei (25Hendrix K.W. Assefa H. Boss W.F. Protoplasma. 1989; 151: 62-72Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The PI 4-kinase activity present in the plasma membrane of carrot cells responded to osmotic stress, cell wall-digesting enzymes, and light (26Chen Q. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 1820-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Memon A. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14817-14821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After solubilization from plasma membranes, this activity could be activated by a soluble 49-kDa protein, PIK-A49, which was also able to bind and bundle actin and was identified as an elongation factor 1α (28Yang W. Burkhart W. Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 392-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activation was subsequently shown to be dependent on the phosphorylation status of PIK-A49 (29Yang W. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3852-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a partial cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana encoding a putative PI 4-kinase, AtPI4Kα, was isolated. The deduced amino acid sequence corresponding to this cDNA comprised domains highly similar to the LKU, PH, and catalytic domains of known PI 4-kinases and, thus, demonstrated that plants posses at least one protein structurally related to known PI 4-kinases. The PH domain present in this plant protein was expressed in bacteria and shown to bind phosphatidic acid, PtdIns-4-P, and PtdIns-4,5-P2 (30Stevenson J.M. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22761-22767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).We are interested in the molecular and genetic analysis of cellular processes involving phosphoinositides in higher plant cells. We describe here the molecular cloning, heterologous expression, and biochemical characterization of a PI 4-kinase, designated AtPI4Kβ, from A. thaliana.DISCUSSIONAlthough PI 4-kinase activity has long been detected, characterized, and partially purified from higher plants, cloning and functional expression of a plant PI 4-kinase has not yet been reported. Here we describe the cloning of a cDNA from A. thalianathat encodes a functional 126-kDa PI 4-kinase. The size of this protein is similar to the size of the smaller of the PI 4-kinases isolated from yeast, D. discoideum, and animals, which is in the range of 90–122 kDa. Recently, Okpodu et al. (45Okpodu C.M. Gross W. Burkhart W. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) partially purified a soluble PI 4-kinase from carrot suspension culture cells. The molecular mass of this protein was estimated to be 83 kDa. Two distinct PI 4-kinase activities have recently been partially purified from spinach plasma membranes, with estimated sizes of 65 and 120 kDa. 4T. Westergren, L. Ekblad, B. Jergil, and M. Sommarin, personal communication. No peptide sequences for any of the partially purified plant PI 4-kinases are available. Therefore it is not possible to know whether any of the partially purified plant PI 4-kinases corresponds to homologs of AtPI4Kβ or AtPI4Kα.Sequence analyses showed that AtPI4Kβ possesses the two conserved domains present in all PI 4-kinases, namely the LKU and the kinase catalytic domains, but lacked a PH domain. These structural features indicate that AtPI4Kβ is a new member of subfamily 1.1 of PI 4-kinases. The molecular structure of AtPI4Kβ most resembles that of the yeast PIK1 and the Dictyostelium DdPI4K proteins. We also identified a novel domain, NH, that corresponds to part of the sequence that was previously identified only in the yeast PIK1 protein and a rat soluble PI 4-kinase (22Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, AtPI4Kβ is the only known PI 4-kinase to possess a unique repetitive motif constituted of 11 repeats of a charged core unit. Interestingly, three putative PtdIns-P kinases from Arabidopsis (Refs. 50Mikami K. Katagirl T. Luchi S. Yamaguchi-Shinozyki K. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 1998; 15: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and 51Satterlee J.S. Sussman M.R. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 864Google Scholar and accession number U95973) also contain a repeated motif, whereas none of the animal enzymes possess such a repeated motif. No clear function can be assigned to the LKU, the NH, or the domain with the repetitive motif; they may play a role in the interaction of PI 4-kinases with other proteins and/or membrane structures.The partial PI 4-kinase isolated from A. thaliana, AtPI4Kα (30Stevenson J.M. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22761-22767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), possesses a PH domain, and its structure resembles that of members of subfamily 1.2 of PI 4-kinases. It was shown that the PH domain of AtPI4Kα can bind PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2but not PtdIns. It was suggested that AtPI4Kα, by binding phosphoinositides at its PH domain, could be involved in the regulation of actin polymerization. It appears, thus, likely that the PH domain of type 1.2 PI 4-kinases is not responsible for binding their substrate. Consequently, it is possible that substrate binding in PI 4-kinases is controlled by the LKU domain or a domain conserved structurally but not at the sequence level.The catalytic properties of the recombinant plant protein,i.e. its stimulation by low concentrations of Triton X-100 as well as its moderate inhibition by adenosine, although they do not match exactly, still resemble those of the PI 4-kinases previously classified as type III more than those classified as type II. As recently observed with other PI 4-kinases, the AtPI4Kβ is inhibited by wortmannin at concentrations that are significantly higher than those required to inhibit PI 3-kinases. The residue corresponding to the Lys residue of the PI 3-kinase PI3Kα at which wortmannin binds covalently (52Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesbroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) is conserved in AtPI4Kβ as it is in all other cloned PI 4-kinases, including AtPI4Kα. Recently, wortmannin at high concentrations was shown to inhibit PI 3-kinase and PI 4-kinase activities in tobacco cells in vivo as well as protein sorting to the plant vacuole (53Matsuoka K. Bassham D.C. Raikhel N.V. Nakamura K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the sorting of proteins to the plant vacuole is controlled by at least two different mechanisms, one of which is wortmannin-sensitive and may involve phosphoinositides (53Matsuoka K. Bassham D.C. Raikhel N.V. Nakamura K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It has been shown in animal cells that a wortmannin-sensitive PI 4-kinase enzyme was involved in the formation of agonist-stimulated inositol trisphosphate (54Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Because plants appear to express similar PI 4-kinase isoforms as animals, it will be of interest to test whether any of the factors that affect phosphoinositide levels in plants, such as light, mastoparan, and fungal elicitors (55Munnik T. Irivne R.F. Musgrave A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1389: 222-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), involve the response of a wortmannin-sensitive PI 4-kinase enzyme.The sequences available so far indicate that in animals each of the two types of PI 4-kinases is represented by several splice variants of one single gene. The whole genome of S. cerevisiae contains only two PI 4-kinase genes. It is now clear that plants also contain subfamily 1.1 and subfamily 1.2 PI 4-kinases. Because PI 4-kinase activities have been detected in most cellular compartments, it is probable that the domains identified in PI 4-kinases are involved in the targeting of PI 4-kinase isoforms to various cellular compartments through interactions with other proteins or lipids. The similarity in structure of the PI 4-kinases found in the different phyla contrasts markedly with the current data available for PI-PLC. Three to four genes have been isolated from A. thaliana (56Hirayama T. Mitsukawa N. Shibata D. Shinozaki K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 34: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 57Hirayama T.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1029-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), potato (59Kopka J. Pical C. Gray J.E. Müller-Röber B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and soybean (60Shi J. Gonzales R.A. Bhattacharyya M.K. Plant J. 1995; 8: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Based on protein structure and biochemical properties, all plant PI-PLC isoforms appear to belong to a single family, which is most closely related to the δ-type of mammalian PI-PLCs, but all lack a PH domain. Because phosphoinositides are now known to be important in processes not involving the canonical second messengers inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, it will be of great interest to compare the regulation and function of PI 4-kinases between animal and plants. In addition, whereas the plant PI-PLC isoforms are expressed in tissue- and/or environmental-specific manner (56Hirayama T. Mitsukawa N. Shibata D. Shinozaki K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 34: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 59Kopka J. Pical C. Gray J.E. Müller-Röber B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the plant PI 4-kinase reported here is ubiquitously expressed in the plant. Future experiments will tell whether plants possess additional subfamily 1.1 PI 4-kinase genes whose expression patterns are developmentally and/or environmentally regulated. Synthesis and hydrolysis of phosphoinositides play an important role in the transduction of physiological signals such as hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters in animal cells (1Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4221) Google Scholar). Sequential phosphorylation of the D4 and D5 positions ofl-α-phosphatidyl-1-d-myo-inositol (PtdIns)1 yields phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns-4-P) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2). PtdIns-4,5-P2is hydrolyzed to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, a stimulator of calcium release from intracellular stores (1Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar), and diacylglycerol, an activator of some protein kinase C isoforms (3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4018) Google Scholar), by phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). In addition to their classical function as precursors of the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, phosphoinositides, including those phosphorylated at the D3 position of the inositol ring, have been shown to regulate cytoskeleton rearrangements through the association with a variety of actin-binding proteins, including profilin, gelsolin, and villin (4Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar,5Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), and can also, for example, potentiate the activation of protein kinase C (6Oh E.S. Woods A. Lim S.T. Theibert A.W.

We are interested in the molecular and genetic analysis of cellular processes involving phosphoinositides in higher plant cells. We describe here the molecular cloning, heterologous expression, and biochemical characterization of a PI 4-kinase, designated AtPI4Kβ, from A. thaliana. DISCUSSIONAlthough PI 4-kinase activity has long been detected, characterized, and partially purified from higher plants, cloning and functional expression of a plant PI 4-kinase has not yet been reported. Here we describe the cloning of a cDNA from A. thalianathat encodes a functional 126-kDa PI 4-kinase. The size of this protein is similar to the size of the smaller of the PI 4-kinases isolated from yeast, D. discoideum, and animals, which is in the range of 90–122 kDa. Recently, Okpodu et al. (45Okpodu C.M. Gross W. Burkhart W. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) partially purified a soluble PI 4-kinase from carrot suspension culture cells. The molecular mass of this protein was estimated to be 83 kDa. Two distinct PI 4-kinase activities have recently been partially purified from spinach plasma membranes, with estimated sizes of 65 and 120 kDa. 4T. Westergren, L. Ekblad, B. Jergil, and M. Sommarin, personal communication. No peptide sequences for any of the partially purified plant PI 4-kinases are available. Therefore it is not possible to know whether any of the partially purified plant PI 4-kinases corresponds to homologs of AtPI4Kβ or AtPI4Kα.Sequence analyses showed that AtPI4Kβ possesses the two conserved domains present in all PI 4-kinases, namely the LKU and the kinase catalytic domains, but lacked a PH domain. These structural features indicate that AtPI4Kβ is a new member of subfamily 1.1 of PI 4-kinases. The molecular structure of AtPI4Kβ most resembles that of the yeast PIK1 and the Dictyostelium DdPI4K proteins. We also identified a novel domain, NH, that corresponds to part of the sequence that was previously identified only in the yeast PIK1 protein and a rat soluble PI 4-kinase (22Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, AtPI4Kβ is the only known PI 4-kinase to possess a unique repetitive motif constituted of 11 repeats of a charged core unit. Interestingly, three putative PtdIns-P kinases from Arabidopsis (Refs. 50Mikami K. Katagirl T. Luchi S. Yamaguchi-Shinozyki K. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 1998; 15: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and 51Satterlee J.S. Sussman M.R. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 864Google Scholar and accession number U95973) also contain a repeated motif, whereas none of the animal enzymes possess such a repeated motif. No clear function can be assigned to the LKU, the NH, or the domain with the repetitive motif; they may play a role in the interaction of PI 4-kinases with other proteins and/or membrane structures.The partial PI 4-kinase isolated from A. thaliana, AtPI4Kα (30Stevenson J.M. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22761-22767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), possesses a PH domain, and its structure resembles that of members of subfamily 1.2 of PI 4-kinases. It was shown that the PH domain of AtPI4Kα can bind PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2but not PtdIns. It was suggested that AtPI4Kα, by binding phosphoinositides at its PH domain, could be involved in the regulation of actin polymerization. It appears, thus, likely that the PH domain of type 1.2 PI 4-kinases is not responsible for binding their substrate. Consequently, it is possible that substrate binding in PI 4-kinases is controlled by the LKU domain or a domain conserved structurally but not at the sequence level.The catalytic properties of the recombinant plant protein,i.e. its stimulation by low concentrations of Triton X-100 as well as its moderate inhibition by adenosine, although they do not match exactly, still resemble those of the PI 4-kinases previously classified as type III more than those classified as type II. As recently observed with other PI 4-kinases, the AtPI4Kβ is inhibited by wortmannin at concentrations that are significantly higher than those required to inhibit PI 3-kinases. The residue corresponding to the Lys residue of the PI 3-kinase PI3Kα at which wortmannin binds covalently (52Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesbroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) is conserved in AtPI4Kβ as it is in all other cloned PI 4-kinases, including AtPI4Kα. Recently, wortmannin at high concentrations was shown to inhibit PI 3-kinase and PI 4-kinase activities in tobacco cells in vivo as well as protein sorting to the plant vacuole (53Matsuoka K. Bassham D.C. Raikhel N.V. Nakamura K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the sorting of proteins to the plant vacuole is controlled by at least two different mechanisms, one of which is wortmannin-sensitive and may involve phosphoinositides (53Matsuoka K. Bassham D.C. Raikhel N.V. Nakamura K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It has been shown in animal cells that a wortmannin-sensitive PI 4-kinase enzyme was involved in the formation of agonist-stimulated inositol trisphosphate (54Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Because plants appear to express similar PI 4-kinase isoforms as animals, it will be of interest to test whether any of the factors that affect phosphoinositide levels in plants, such as light, mastoparan, and fungal elicitors (55Munnik T. Irivne R.F. Musgrave A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1389: 222-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), involve the response of a wortmannin-sensitive PI 4-kinase enzyme.The sequences available so far indicate that in animals each of the two types of PI 4-kinases is represented by several splice variants of one single gene. The whole genome of S. cerevisiae contains only two PI 4-kinase genes. It is now clear that plants also contain subfamily 1.1 and subfamily 1.2 PI 4-kinases. Because PI 4-kinase activities have been detected in most cellular compartments, it is probable that the domains identified in PI 4-kinases are involved in the targeting of PI 4-kinase isoforms to various cellular compartments through interactions with other proteins or lipids. The similarity in structure of the PI 4-kinases found in the different phyla contrasts markedly with the current data available for PI-PLC. Three to four genes have been isolated from A. thaliana (56Hirayama T. Mitsukawa N. Shibata D. Shinozaki K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 34: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 57Hirayama T.

Plant J. 1995; 8: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Based on protein structure and biochemical properties, all plant PI-PLC isoforms appear to belong to a single family, which is most closely related to the δ-type of mammalian PI-PLCs, but all lack a PH domain. Because phosphoinositides are now known to be important in processes not involving the canonical second messengers inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, it will be of great interest to compare the regulation and function of PI 4-kinases between animal and plants. In addition, whereas the plant PI-PLC isoforms are expressed in tissue- and/or environmental-specific manner (56Hirayama T. Mitsukawa N. Shibata D. Shinozaki K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 34: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 59Kopka J. Pical C. Gray J.E. Müller-Röber B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the plant PI 4-kinase reported here is ubiquitously expressed in the plant. Future experiments will tell whether plants possess additional subfamily 1.1 PI 4-kinase genes whose expression patterns are developmentally and/or environmentally regulated. Although PI 4-kinase activity has long been detected, characterized, and partially purified from higher plants, cloning and functional expression of a plant PI 4-kinase has not yet been reported.

In this study, we examined how cellular Ca2+ homeostasis is maintained in a vps33Δ vacuolar biogenesis mutant. We found that growth of the vps33Δ strain was sensitive to high or low extracellular Ca2+. This strain could not properly regulate cytosolic Ca2+ levels and was able to retain only a small fraction of its total cellular Ca2+ in a nonexchangeable intracellular pool. Surprisingly, thevps33Δ strain contained more total cellular Ca2+ than the wild type strain. Because most cellular Ca2+ is normally found within the vacuole, this suggested that other intracellular compartments compensated for the reduced capacity to store Ca2+ within the vacuole of this strain. To test this hypothesis, we examined the contribution of the Golgi-localized Ca2+ ATPase Pmr1p in the maintenance of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. We found that avps33Δ/pmr1Δ strain was hypersensitive to high extracellular Ca2+. In addition, certain combinations of mutations effecting both vacuolar and Golgi Ca2+ transport resulted in synthetic lethality.

This tight regulation of intracellular Ca2+ is required to control the complex signaling pathways mediated by cytosolic Ca2+-sensing proteins such as calmodulin. Remarkably, yeast cells can maintain intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in the presence of environmental Ca2+ concentrations ranging from <1 μm to >100 mm (4Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 157-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The vacuole is thought to play a key role in maintaining Ca2+ tolerance over this wide range because it contains >90% of the total cellular Ca2+ (5Ohsumi Y. Kitamoto K. Anraku Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Eilam Y. Lavi H. Grossowicz N. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 623-629Google Scholar). Accordingly, many different vacuolar mutations result in an inability to grow in the presence of high concentrations of extracellular Ca2+ (7Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J.

The first of these is the vacuolar Ca2+ ATPase encoded by the PMC1gene, a homolog of the mammalian PMCA plasma membrane family of Ca2+ ATPases. The loss of Pmc1p results in an inability to grow in the presence of high environmental Ca2+ (7Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The second protein known to be involved in vacuolar Ca2+ transport is the H+/Ca2+ exchanger encoded by theVCX1 (HUM1) gene (14Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 15Pozos T.C. Sekler I. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3730-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although mutants that do not express Vcx1p show little or no decrease in Ca2+tolerance, the combination of pmc1Δ and vcx1Δmutations leads to a more severe Ca2+-sensitive phenotype than the loss of either transporter alone. Both the expression and function of these two vacuolar Ca2+ transporters are regulated by calcineurin, a highly conserved protein phosphatase that is activated by Ca2+/calmodulin. As in mammalian cells, the activation of yeast calcineurin can be blocked by the immunosupressant drugs cyclosporin A (CsA)1and FK506 (16Breuder T. Hemenway C.S. Movva N.R. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J.

Nature. 1992; 360: 682-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Although the functional relationship between these two vacuolar Ca2+ transporters is complex, it has been reported that calcineurin activation stimulates Pmc1p function and inhibits Vcx1p function (14Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 15Pozos T.C. Sekler I. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3730-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Several other genes encoding potential Ca2+ ATPases have been identified within the yeast genome (18Catty P. Goffeau A. Biosci. Rep. 1996; 16: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); however, the only member of this group demonstrated to play a role in Ca2+ transport is encoded by the PMR1 gene. Pmr1p is related to the SERCA family of Ca2+ ATPases and has been shown to reside in the Golgi apparatus of S. cerevisiae (19Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 20Halachmi D. Eilam Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Rudolph H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although Pmr1p and Pmc1p both act to partition Ca2+ into distinct cellular compartments, their roles in Ca2+ homeostasis do not appear to be equivalent. First, cells lacking Pmc1p are sensitive to high environmental Ca2+, whereas cells lacking Pmr1p cannot grow under low Ca2+ conditions. In addition, the total cellular Ca2+ level in a pmc1Δ strain is 2–3-fold lower than normal, but the total cellular Ca2+ level in thepmr1Δ mutant is 4–5-fold higher than normal. These different phenotypes suggest that the vacuole and the Golgi apparatus normally carry out distinct roles in Ca2+ homeostasis. Genetic screens have identified at least 60 different genes involved in vacuolar protein localization (23Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 230-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these, the class C vacuolar protein sorting mutants (which include the vps11,vps16, vps18, and vps33 mutants) result in the most severe defects in vacuolar biogenesis. For example, strains carrying the vps33Δ mutation lack a morphologically distinguishable vacuole but instead accumulate small vesicular and Golgi-like structures (24Banta L.M. Robinson J.S.

These anomalous compartments may result from the inability to dock and/or fuse late transport vesicles from the biosynthetic, endocytic, and autophagic pathways with the vacuole (27Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2307-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). A vps33Δ strain was also found to secrete >90% of soluble vacuolar proteins such as carboxypeptidase Y and to mislocalize nearly 50% of the vacuolar membrane protein α-mannosidase to the cell surface (24Banta L.M. Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1369-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In this study we asked how the severe defects in vacuolar biogenesis associated with the vps33Δ mutation affect cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. We found that the vps33Δstrain was sensitive to both high and low levels of environmental Ca2+ and was unable to regulate cytosolic Ca2+levels properly when exposed to a sudden, large increase in environmental Ca2+. Despite its defect in vacuolar biogenesis, we found that the vps33Δ strain contains more total cellular Ca2+ than a wild type strain. To determine whether other intracellular compartments compensate for reduced vacuolar Ca2+ storage, we examined whether the Golgi-localized Ca2+ ATPase Pmr1p plays a significant role in Ca2+ homeostasis in the vps33Δ strain. We found that PMR1 expression is elevated in thevps33Δ strain. We also found that avps33Δ/pmr1Δ strain is hypersensitive to high extracellular Ca2+, and the combination of certain mutations effecting both vacuolar and Golgi Ca2+ transport results in synthetic lethality. These results indicate that the Golgi apparatus plays a significant role in maintaining Ca2+homeostasis when vacuolar biogenesis is compromised. Strains used in this study are listed in TableI. The PMC1 andVCX1 genes were disrupted using the one-step gene replacement method (28Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). A 1.62-kb fragment of the PMC1 gene was generated by PCR using wild type yeast genomic DNA as template. The forward primer used was 5′-ATCGGTACCA CTTGGATTGC AT-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CATGGATCCT GCCATCCTCA-3′. These primers contained KpnI and BamHI restriction endonuclease sites respectively (underlined). The PCR product was digested with KpnI and BamHI and cloned into a pBluescript II KS (+) plasmid. The 1.06-kb segment of thePMC1 gene was then removed by digestion withAflIII and EcoRI and replaced by theTRP1 gene taken from pJJ280 plasmid (29Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). AKpnI/NotI fragment containing the disruptedpmc1Δ::TRP1 fragment was then used to transform yeast. Trp+ colonies were selected, and the correct gene replacement was confirmed by PCR.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainRelevant genotypeComplete genotypeSourceSEY6210Wild typeMATα, ura3–52, leu2–3 112, his3-Δ200, trp1-Δ901, lys2–801, suc2-Δ9S.

The forward primer used was 5′-CGTGGTACCT TGTCATCCTCAC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GCTAGGATCC GCTAAAATAG G-3′. Again, these primers contained KpnI and BamHI restriction endonuclease sites, respectively (underlined). The fragment was digested with these enzymes and cloned into a pBluescript II KS (+) plasmid. A 1.56-kb fragment was removed from the VCX1 DNA by digestion withHincII and HindIII endonucleases and replaced with a fragment containing the URA3 gene obtained from pJJ244 (29Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). A KpnI/BamHI fragment containing the disrupted vcx1Δ::URA3 fragment from this plasmid was used to transform yeast. The replacement of wild typeVCX1 was confirmed by PCR analysis. Other genetic manipulations were carried out by standard methods (30Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Bacterial strains were grown on standard media (31Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Yeast strains were maintained on YP medium containing 2%d-glucose (YPD) or synthetic minimal medium containing 2%d-glucose (SMD) and other supplements as required (30Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Growth media were routinely buffered with 40 mm MES-Tris, pH 5.5. EGTA was used to reduce the Ca2+ concentration of buffered media. Because YPD and SMD media contain divalent cations other than Ca2+, the effective concentrations of Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, K+, and Na+ were considered when calculating free Ca2+ concentrations. Known quantities of CaCl2stock solutions were added, and the resulting free Ca2+concentrations were calculated based on the total concentration of Ca2+ as well as other cations, pH, and temperature of the medium. These calculations were done using the Maxchelator 1.2 program. 50–100 A 600 units of yeast growing in YPD supplemented with CaCl2 or EGTA were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were washed with fresh YP and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes whose mass had previously been determined gravimetrically to an accuracy of 0.1 mg on an analytical balance. The tubes were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were removed carefully. The tubes were then respun, and any remaining supernatant was again removed. The tubes containing the pellets were weighed to determine the wet weight of the pellet, and the pellets were then dried to completion in a Savant SpeedVac system. The tubes were then weighed again to determine the dry weight of the pellet. 1m HCl was added to the dry pellets, and the capped microcentrifuge tubes were vortexed and incubated on a rocker for at least 24 h. Thereafter each sample was centrifuged briefly in a microcentrifuge, and multiple aliquots of each supernatant were taken for ion measurements. Ca2+, Na+, and K+ measurements of aliquots were carried out with an Eppendorf EFOX-5070 flame photometer; Mg2+ levels of aliquots were determined using a Varian AA-20 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Cellular ion concentrations were then calculated based on the dry weight of the samples and dilution factors. Total combined orthophosphate and polyphosphate levels (referred to as total inorganic phosphate) were determined in the 1 m HCl hydrolysate described above using an acid molybdate-based diagnostic kit (Sigma). The phosphorus levels measured represent the sum of the acid-hydrolyzed polyphosphate and the inorganic phosphate present (32Stanton M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 22: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A pEVP11-based plasmid containing a functional apoaequorin gene (pAEQ) was transformed into yeast using theLEU2 gene as selectable marker (1Batiza A.F. Schulz T. Masson P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23357-23362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This plasmid was a gift from Patrick Masson. Cells containing the pAEQ plasmid were grown in SMD medium containing other necessary supplements and were harvested in the logarithmic growth phase. 10 A 600 units of cells were resuspended in 0.2 ml of aequorin test medium, which consists of SMD medium (which contains 1 mmCa2+) supplemented with 2 mm EGTA and 20 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.5. The free Ca2+concentration of this medium was calculated to be 6 μm. To convert the apoaequorin to aequorin, 10 μl of 590 μmcoelenterazine (dissolved in methanol) was added, and the cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. They were then centrifuged briefly in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant containing excess coelenterazine was removed. The cells were washed again in 0.5 ml of aequorin test medium, and the cells were then resuspended in test medium and incubated at room temperature for 20 min before initiating the experiment. A Berthold Lumat 9050 luminometer was used to collect aequorin light emission data at 200-ms intervals. The data were downloaded directly to a computer using the MS Windows Terminal software and transferred to Microsoft Excel 5.0 for analysis. To determine the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ using the aequorin reporter system, it was necessary to determine: 1) the total amount of reconstituted aequorin available for light emission and 2) the relationship between Ca2+ concentration and light emission (33Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Prendergast F.G. Science. 1977; 195: 996-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The total amount of reconstituted aequorin was determined routinely in a crude extract of each strain by measuring the maximum light emission (L max) value in the presence of a saturating concentration of Ca2+. To prepare the crude extract, 2 A 600 units of cells in 0.2 ml of aequorin standard buffer (100 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.5; 150 mm KCl; 20 mm NaCl; 5 mmMgCl2; and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were lysed by agitation with glass beads at 4 °C. A 25-μl aliquot was placed in the luminometer, and the L max of this sample was induced by injecting 25 μl of a 50 mmCaCl2 solution. The L max value was generally between 0.5 and 1.0 × 107 relative light units/s. The protein concentration of cell lysates was also measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. A correction factor based upon theL max value/unit of protein was determined for each strain, and this value was used to correct for minor differences in the concentration of aequorin in different strains. To determine the relationship between the free Ca2+concentration and aequorin-based light emission, a standard curve was prepared using a cell lysate as described (33Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Prendergast F.G. Science. 1977; 195: 996-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Briefly, increasing concentrations of CaCl2 were added to a crude extract of wild type cells prepared in aequorin standard buffer. To determine the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration within intact cells, both theL observed in intact cells and theL max emission observed in a crude extract of the same cells were determined. The ratio between these values (L:L max) was then used to estimate the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration from our standard curve. In no case was the L value in an experiment greater than 2–3% of the L max value. Thus, the absolute amount of reconstituted aequorin was not limiting in any of these experiments. To determine the rate of Ca2+ uptake by different mutant strains, cells were grown in SMD medium to approximately 1.0A 600/ml. Cells were harvested and resuspended in a buffer containing 40 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.5, and 20 mmd-glucose. An aliquot of45Ca2+ (NEN Life Science Products) was then added, and aliquots were filtered through 0.45-μm Millipore filters on a 12-position Millipore vacuum manifold at the indicated times. The filtered cells were washed immediately with two 5-ml aliquots of ice-cold blocking solution (150 mm NaCl, 20 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm LaCl3). The cell-associated counts on the filter were then determined by scintillation counting. To calculate absolute Ca2+ levels, cpm were converted to mmol of Ca2+/kg dry mass based upon total cellular Ca2+ measurements as determined by flame photometry under identical growth conditions. Cells for Ca2+ exchange experiments were grown in YPD medium to a density of 0.05 A 600. The medium was then supplemented with 45Ca2+, and the cells were grown to a cell density of 0.5–1 A 600/ml. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 ×g for 5 min, washed, and resuspended in fresh YPD supplemented with 50 mm CaCl2. At the indicated times, aliquots were removed, filtered, washed, and processed for scintillation counting as described above. RNA extraction and Northern analysis were carried out as described previously (34Bonetti B. Fu L. Moon J. Bedwell D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 334-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Strains were grown in YPD medium in the presence of 1 mm EGTA (estimated to result in 0.01 mm free Ca2+) or 50 mm calcium to 1 A 600/ml. A 0.56-kb region of thePMR1 gene was amplified by PCR using the primers DB-483 (5′-GGCCCCAATGAAATAACCGT AG-3′) and DB-484 (5′-CCTGTTCCTAC GACGATACCC T-3′). The ACT1 probe was prepared by PCR amplification using the primers DB-154 (5′-GCGCG GAATT CAACG TTCCA GCCTT CTAC-3′) and DB-155 (5′-GGATG GAACA AAGCT TCTGG-3′). All probes were labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the random hexamer method. Radioactivity in specific hybrids was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). After quantitating the radioactivity associated with PMR1 mRNA, the membranes were hybridized with the ACT1 probe. After background correction, the PMR1 signal of each sample was corrected with the ACT1 mRNA control. These corrected values were then normalized to the wild type strain grown under low Ca2+ conditions. We initially compared the Ca2+ tolerance of yeast strains containing knockouts of genes involved in vacuolar Ca2+ transport (pmc1Δ, vcx1Δ, or pmc1Δ/vcx1Δ) vacuolar biogenesis (vps33Δ) or a combination of both classes (vps33Δ/pmc1Δ/vcx1Δ). Each strain was streaked onto YPD plates supplemented with increasing concentrations of CaCl2 or with 10 mm EGTA and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. The wild type, pmc1Δ, vcx1Δ, andpmc1Δ/vcx1Δ strains grew similarly on standard YPD plates (buffered to pH 5.5) containing 0.3 mmCa2+ (Fig. 1 A), whereas the colony size of the vps33Δ andvps33Δ/pmc1Δ/vcx1Δ strains was slightly smaller. The wild type, pmc1Δ, and vcx1Δ strains also grew similarly on YPD medium supplemented with 100 mmCaCl2, whereas the growth rate of thepmc1Δ/vcx1Δ double mutant was reduced significantly on this medium (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, neither thevps33Δ strain nor the vps33Δ/pmc1Δ/vcx1Δstrain was able to form visible colonies under these growth conditions during the 48-h incubation period. When the YPD plates were supplemented with 200 mmCaCl2, both the wild type and vcx1Δ strains grew somewhat more slowly than on YPD plates supplemented with 100 mm CaCl2. The pmc1Δ/vcx1Δ double mutant was unable to grow under these conditions, whereas thepmc1Δ strain grew much more slowly than the wild type strain (Fig. 1 C). A further doubling of the Ca2+concentration in the YPD plate to 400 mm completely inhibited growth of the pmc1Δ strain but not the growth of the wild type and vcx1Δ strains (not shown). None of these strains was inhibited by the addition of either 400 mm NaCl or 400 mm KCl to the YPD plates, indicating that the increased osmolarity associated with 200 mmCaCl2 did not cause the growth sensitivity described above. We conclude that strains harboring the vps33Δ mutation show greater sensitivity to high extracellular Ca2+ than strains carrying the pmc1Δ mutation, thevcx1Δ mutation, or both mutations together. Overall, the rank order of Ca2+ sensitivity observed for these strains was: vps33Δ/pmc1Δ/vcx1Δ and vps33Δstrains > pmc1Δ/vcx1Δ strain >pmc1Δ strain > vcx1Δ and wild type strains. We also examined whether the growth of these strains was sensitive to inhibition by the chelating agent EGTA. We found thatpmc1Δ, vcx1Δ, and pmc1Δ/vcx1Δstrains grew similarly to the wild type strain on YPD plates buffered to pH 5.5 and supplemented with 10 mm EGTA (Fig.1 D). In contrast, the growth of the vps33Δ andvps33Δ/pmc1Δ/vcx1Δ strains was severely inhibited under these conditions, suggesting that they require a higher minimal level of environmental Ca2+ for efficient growth than the other strains. However, not only Ca2+ but other cations such as Zn2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ are also complexed effectively by EGTA. To confirm that low environmental Ca2+ was responsible for EGTA sensitivity, we supplemented EGTA-pretreated media with different divalent cations to determine the component(s) required for growth of the vps33Δ strain. We found that the addition of Ca2+ could restore a significant amount of growth in YPD medium treated with EGTA, whereas several other cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+) could not (data not shown). These results lead us to conclude that the vps33Δ andvps33Δ/pmc1Δ/vcx1Δ strains are more sensitive to either high or low levels of environmental Ca2+ than the wild type, pmc1Δ, vcx1Δ, andpmc1Δ/vcx1Δ strains. Yeast cells, like mammalian cells, have been reported to maintain cytosolic free Ca2+ levels in the range of 50–200 nm(1Batiza A.F. Schulz T. Masson P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23357-23362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 2Iida H. Yagawa Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To determine how the above mutations affect the ability of yeast to maintain cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis, we introduced a plasmid encoding a cytosolic form of apoaequorin into each strain (1Batiza A.F. Schulz T. Masson P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23357-23362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Apoaequorin can be converted to aequorin by incubating the strains with the membrane-permeant cofactor coelenterazine. Once active aequorin is generated, it is capable of emitting light as a function of the free Ca2+ concentration present in the cytosol (33Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Prendergast F.G. Science. 1977; 195: 996-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In the experiments described here, the aequorin-dependent light emission of each strain was sampled throughout the experiment at 200-ms intervals. To determine the cytosolic Ca2+concentration as a function of light emission, a standard curve was prepared using crude extracts from the wild type strain where the light emission at each Ca2+ concentration was correlated to theL max each sample was capable of discharging (Fig. 2 A). Using this method, the relative light units/s emitted from the wild type strain routinely corresponded to a resting free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration of ∼75 nm when cells were incubated in a medium containing low (∼6 μm) free Ca2+ (for further details, see “Materials and Methods”). To determine how various mutations affect the ability of these strains to respond to a sudden increase in extracellular Ca2+, 50 mm CaCl2 was injected rapidly into the cell suspension while the cytosolic aequorin-dependent light emission was continuously monitored. We found that the light emission of the wild type strain increased rapidly and reached a peak level corresponding to ∼300 nm cytosolic Ca2+within 5 s (Fig. 2 B). The Ca2+concentration decreased rapidly thereafter and returned to a new steady-state free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration of ∼80–85 nm within 90 s. The light emission measured in the pmc1Δ/vcx1Δ strain corresponded to a basal cytosolic Ca2+ concentration of 75–80 nm. When 50 mm CaCl2 was injected, the light emission reached a peak value corresponding to ∼385 nm cytosolic free Ca2+, which was somewhat higher than the peak observed with the wild type strain. The recovery phase of the pmc1Δ/vcx1Δ strain was also much weaker than the wild type control. The post-shock steady-state cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was ∼310 nm, which was 4-fold higher than the steady-state cytosolic Ca2+ concentration observed in the wild type strain after the same Ca2+ shock.

https://openalex.org/W2083245831,"Aggrecan, the predominant large proteoglycan of cartilage, is a multidomain macromolecule with each domain contributing specific functional properties. One of the domains contains the majority of the keratan sulfate (KS) chain substituents and a protein segment with a proline-rich hexapeptide repeat sequence. The function of this domain is unknown but the primary structure suggests a potential for binding to collagen fibrils. We have examined binding of aggrecan fragments encompassing the KS-rich region in a solid-phase assay. A moderate affinity (apparent K d = 1.1 μm) for isolated collagen II, as well as collagen I, was demonstrated. Enzymatic digestion of the KS chains did not alter the capacity of the peptide to bind to collagen, whereas cleavage of the protein core abolished the interaction. The distribution of the aggrecan KS-rich region in bovine tarsometatarsal joint cartilage was investigated using immunoelectron microscopy. Immunoreactivity was relatively low in the superficial zone and higher in the intermediate and deep zones of the uncalcified cartilage. Within the pericellular and territorial matrix compartments the epitopes representing the aggrecan KS-rich region were detected preferentially near or at collagen fibrils. Along the fibrils, epitope reactivity was non-randomly distributed, showing preference for the gap region within the d-period. Our data suggest that collagen fibrils interact with the KS-rich regions of several aggrecan monomers aligned within a proteoglycan aggregate.

Aspden R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; (July): 260-265Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (103) Google Scholar), where aggrecan complexes are entangled within a network of collagen fibrils. The aggrecan complexes, constituting about 90% of the proteoglycan content (2Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1993: 189-209Google Scholar), endow the matrix with high osmotic pressure, compressive stiffness, and resilience, whereas collagen is essential for the tensile strength of the tissue (3Maroudas A. Nature. 1976; 260: 808-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Different mechanical properties of the composite depend on these major constituents and how they are assembled and stabilized by intermolecular interactions. The capacity of cartilage to withstand mechanical stress depends upon its structural integrity and, hence, numerous interactions between the matrix components. Indeed, the molecules are so tightly associated that most of the tissue constituents require denaturing solvents or proteases for extraction. This has hampered studies of molecular function. To gain insight into the physiology of articular cartilage, it is necessary to identify and characterize interactions between the matrix constituents, particularly those involving the collagen.In the present study we focused on a domain of the aggrecan molecule containing the majority of the keratan sulfate (KS)1 chain substituents and a protein segment with a hexapeptide repeat sequence (4Antonsson P. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16170-16173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second globular domain (G2) is localized adjacent to this KS-rich region, on the N-terminal side. The first globular domain (G1), which represents the hyaluronan-binding region (HABr), is localized next to G2 as the very N-terminal portion of aggrecan. On the C-terminal side of the KS-rich region, there is a large chondroitin sulfate (CS)-rich region that accounts for more than 80% of the molecular mass. The very C-terminal end contains a number of distinct domains including one with homology to C-type lectins.Proteoglycan aggregates are made up of several aggrecan molecules that are bound via their G1 domains to hyaluronan. The binding is stabilized by a third component, the link protein, that binds simultaneously to aggrecan and hyaluronan (see Heinegård and Sommarin, Ref. 5Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Cunningham L.W. Methods in Enzymology, Structural and Contractile Proteins. 144. Academic Press Inc., New York1987: 305-319Google Scholar). In the aggregate, the G2 and KS-rich portions are interspaced between the central hyaluronan strand and the region with the densely packed CS chains. The structure of the KS-rich region suggests a relatively extended and rigid conformation. This is supported by electron microscopy of spread proteoglycan aggregates after rotary shadowing, showing that the CS-rich region is clearly separated from the central filament of hyaluronan (6Heinegård D. Lohmander S. Thyberg J. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It appears that the KS-rich region acts as a spacer within the proteoglycan aggregate. Interestingly, the dimensions of this region are similar to the diameter of the collagen fibril.The primary structure of the KS-rich region polypeptide encompasses a number of consecutive proline-rich hexapeptide repeats, where the bovine form contains 23 of these repeats (4Antonsson P. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16170-16173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proline-rich repeat may form a polyproline coil. 2Jürgen Engel, personal communication. 2Jürgen Engel, personal communication.Such a structure has the potential for interacting with the collagen fibril, which in this case could find sufficient space to run through the center of the proteoglycan aggregate and by interactions reinforce the network of assembled aggrecan molecules. This hypothesis was put to test in the present work.DISCUSSIONPrevious histochemical studies have indicated a close spatial relationship between proteoglycans and collagen in soft tissues,e.g. in tendon and annulus fibrosus (21Scott J.E.

Immunohistochemical examination has shown that the small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan decorin is associated with fibrils in tendon (23Pringle G.A. Dodd C.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and dermis (24Fleischmajer R. Fisher L.W. MacDonald E.D. Jacobs Jr., L. Perlish J.S. Termine J.D. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), apparently because of interactions between the core protein and collagen. In cartilage, both decorin and collagen IX occur as fibril-associated proteoglycans (25Vaughan L. Mendler M. Huber S. Bruckner P. Winterhalter K.H. Irwin M.I. Mayne R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 26Hagg R. Bruckner P. Hedbom E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), albeit that most of the collagen IX molecules in mammalian cartilage do not appear to have an attached glycosaminoglycan chain (27Ayad S. Marriot A. Brierley V.H. Grant M.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have observed that the keratan sulfate proteoglycan fibromodulin is distributed along collagen fibrils in articular cartilage (15Hedlund H. Mengarelli-Widholm S. Heinegård D. Reinholt F.P. Svensson O. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), also apparently bound via its core protein (11Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These small proteoglycans are bound to the fibrils by strong interactions, in the case of collagen IX stabilized by covalent bonds. Therefore, these molecules can be considered as fibril constituents. In contrast, the large cartilage proteoglycan aggrecan occurs in the tissue in a well characterized supramolecular form that is distinct from the fibrils. This aggregate consists of up to 100 aggrecan monomers and an equal number of link proteins, associated with a single strand of hyaluronan. It is likely that there are interactions between collagen fibrils and the proteoglycan aggregates, important for the mechanical properties of cartilage, but the mechanisms are not known. Based on work within vitro systems, it has been proposed that the CS-rich region of aggrecan is essential for interactions (29Oegema Jr., T.R. Laidlaw J. Hascall V.C. Dziewiatkowski D.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 170: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 895-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of an interaction of some kind within the tissue, is supported by observations made by immunoperoxidase electron microscopy indicating a periodic arrangement of the proteoglycan along cartilage fibrils (31Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Reiner A. Rosenberg L. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 921-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).The results presented here provide strong evidence that a proteoglycan aggregate interacts with a collagen fibril located within the aggregate, near the central hyaluronan strand. It is reasonable to assume that the KS-rich region represents an extended structure surrounded by free space. This molecular architecture may allow diffusion of some matrix constituents, e.g. procollagen, and may participate in specific interactions. Hypothetically, a collagen fibril may be positioned as a backbone within the aggrecan complex and connect several aggrecan KS-rich regions (Fig.8). Even though each KS-rich region forms a fairly weak interaction, the multiplicity existing in the aggregate would result in a very tight complex with the collagen fibril. Such an arrangement would considerably influence the structural integrity of the proteoglycan aggregate. It could also have an important role in providing the microenvironment for the formation of fibrils in cartilage. Articular cartilage matrix can be regarded as a fiber-reinforced composite material (1Hukins D.W.L. Aspden R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; (July): 260-265Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (103) Google Scholar), where aggrecan complexes are entangled within a network of collagen fibrils. The aggrecan complexes, constituting about 90% of the proteoglycan content (2Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1993: 189-209Google Scholar), endow the matrix with high osmotic pressure, compressive stiffness, and resilience, whereas collagen is essential for the tensile strength of the tissue (3Maroudas A. Nature. 1976; 260: 808-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Different mechanical properties of the composite depend on these major constituents and how they are assembled and stabilized by intermolecular interactions. The capacity of cartilage to withstand mechanical stress depends upon its structural integrity and, hence, numerous interactions between the matrix components. Indeed, the molecules are so tightly associated that most of the tissue constituents require denaturing solvents or proteases for extraction. This has hampered studies of molecular function. To gain insight into the physiology of articular cartilage, it is necessary to identify and characterize interactions between the matrix constituents, particularly those involving the collagen. In the present study we focused on a domain of the aggrecan molecule containing the majority of the keratan sulfate (KS)1 chain substituents and a protein segment with a hexapeptide repeat sequence (4Antonsson P. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16170-16173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second globular domain (G2) is localized adjacent to this KS-rich region, on the N-terminal side. The first globular domain (G1), which represents the hyaluronan-binding region (HABr), is localized next to G2 as the very N-terminal portion of aggrecan. On the C-terminal side of the KS-rich region, there is a large chondroitin sulfate (CS)-rich region that accounts for more than 80% of the molecular mass. The very C-terminal end contains a number of distinct domains including one with homology to C-type lectins. Proteoglycan aggregates are made up of several aggrecan molecules that are bound via their G1 domains to hyaluronan. The binding is stabilized by a third component, the link protein, that binds simultaneously to aggrecan and hyaluronan (see Heinegård and Sommarin, Ref. 5Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Cunningham L.W. Methods in Enzymology, Structural and Contractile Proteins. 144. Academic Press Inc., New York1987: 305-319Google Scholar). In the aggregate, the G2 and KS-rich portions are interspaced between the central hyaluronan strand and the region with the densely packed CS chains. The structure of the KS-rich region suggests a relatively extended and rigid conformation. This is supported by electron microscopy of spread proteoglycan aggregates after rotary shadowing, showing that the CS-rich region is clearly separated from the central filament of hyaluronan (6Heinegård D. Lohmander S. Thyberg J. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It appears that the KS-rich region acts as a spacer within the proteoglycan aggregate. Interestingly, the dimensions of this region are similar to the diameter of the collagen fibril. The primary structure of the KS-rich region polypeptide encompasses a number of consecutive proline-rich hexapeptide repeats, where the bovine form contains 23 of these repeats (4Antonsson P. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16170-16173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proline-rich repeat may form a polyproline coil. 2Jürgen Engel, personal communication. 2Jürgen Engel, personal communication.Such a structure has the potential for interacting with the collagen fibril, which in this case could find sufficient space to run through the center of the proteoglycan aggregate and by interactions reinforce the network of assembled aggrecan molecules. This hypothesis was put to test in the present work. DISCUSSIONPrevious histochemical studies have indicated a close spatial relationship between proteoglycans and collagen in soft tissues,e.g. in tendon and annulus fibrosus (21Scott J.E. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and in articular cartilage (22Orford C.R. Gardner D.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1984; 12: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical examination has shown that the small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan decorin is associated with fibrils in tendon (23Pringle G.A. Dodd C.M. J. Histochem.

Biol. 1991; 106: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), apparently because of interactions between the core protein and collagen. In cartilage, both decorin and collagen IX occur as fibril-associated proteoglycans (25Vaughan L. Mendler M. Huber S. Bruckner P. Winterhalter K.H. Irwin M.I. Mayne R. J.

Furthermore, we have observed that the keratan sulfate proteoglycan fibromodulin is distributed along collagen fibrils in articular cartilage (15Hedlund H. Mengarelli-Widholm S. Heinegård D.

The distinct binding traits ofSalmonella type 1 fimbriae is also reflected in their binding to selected mannosylated proteins and in their ability to promote secondary bacterial aggregation on enterocyte surfaces. The determinant of binding in Salmonella type 1 fimbriae is a 35-kDa structurally distinct fimbrial subunit, FimHs, because inactivation of fimHs abolished binding activity in the resulting mutant without any apparent effect on fimbrial expression. Surprisingly, when expressed in the absence of other fimbrial components and as a translational fusion protein with MalE, FimHs failed to demonstrate any specific binding tropism and bound equally to all cells and mannosylated proteins tested. To determine if the binding specificity ofSalmonella type 1 fimbriae was determined by the fimbrial shaft that is intimately associated with FimHs, we replaced the amino-terminal half of FimHs with the corresponding sequence from Escherichia coli FimH (FimHe) that contains the receptor binding domain of FimHe. The resulting hybrid fimbriae bearing FimHes on aSalmonella fimbrial shaft exhibited binding traits that resembled that of Salmonella rather than E. coli fimbriae.

Falkow S. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1833-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The virulence of the organism has been attributed in part to its capacity to invade enterocytes and macrophages and to survive and grow intracellularly within these cells. A cluster of contiguous genes located in three pathogenicity islands, SPI-1, SPI-2, and the SelC locus in the chromosome ofS. typhimurium, has been implicated these activities (2Groisman E.A. Ochman H. Cell. 1996; 87: 791-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 3Blanc-Potard A.-B. Groisman E.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5376-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Many of the genes mediating bacterial entry into host cells are located in SPI-1 (2Groisman E.A. Ochman H. Cell. 1996; 87: 791-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The entry mechanisms of Salmonella are quite complex, involving an intimate interaction between the bacterium and the host cell which results in the “exchange” of biochemical signals. As a consequence of this interaction, a complex set of signaling events is triggered in the host cell, leading to marked cytoskeletal rearrangements, membrane ruffling, and bacterial uptake by macropinocytosis (4Galan J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Central to these bacteria-host interactions is the activation in the Salmonella spp. of a specialized protein secretion system that directs the export of a variety of proteins and, in some cases, their direct translocation into the host cell (4Galan J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 5Lee C.A. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 148-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This bacterial secretion system, referred to as type III secretion system, does not appear to have any host cell specificity and has been shown to promote bacterial invasion of a wide range of host cells. Yet, in nature Salmonella exhibits a specific tropism for the gut epithelium of the host, and the primary targets for the invading Salmonella, at least in the initial stages of infection, are typically the cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. S. typhimurium expresses several hair-like appendages (fimbriae) on its surface, whose function is as yet unclear. Since the fimbriae protrude peritrichously from the bacterial surface, it is highly likely that these structures will greatly influence the nature and intensity of any interactions that might occur between bacteria and host cells. The most commonly expressed fimbriae onSalmonella are the type 1 fimbriae, which are characterized by their capacity to bind mannose residues on host cell surfaces or in soluble compounds (6Duguid J.P. Anderson E.S. Campbell I. J. Pathol. Bacteriol. 1966; 19: 107-138Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). That these structures contribute to the pathogenicity of S. typhimurium may be deduced from the findings that type 1-fimbriated Salmonella are significantly more virulent than their fim minus counterparts (7Duguid J.P. Dareker M.R. Wheater D.W.F. J. Med. Microbiol. 1976; 9: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 41Van Der Velden A.W.M. Baumler A.J. Tsolis R.M. Heffron F. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2803-2808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and from the recent observations that type 1 fimbriae are expressedin vivo by S. typhimurium during an infection (8Ewen S.W.B. Naughton P.J. Grant G. Sojka M. Allen-Vercoe E. Bardocz S. Thorns C.J. Pusztai A. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1997; 18: 185-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The type 1 fim gene cluster is located at 15 min in theS. typhimurium chromosome (9Sanderson K.E. Hessel A. Rudd K.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 241-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); although not associated with any known pathogenicity islands, the fim cluster maps closely to a tRNA gene (10Swenson D.L. Kim K.-J. Six E.W. Clegg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since most pathogenicity islands are located next to tRNA genes (2Groisman E.A. Ochman H. Cell. 1996; 87: 791-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), the fim locus ofSalmonella may be part of an as yet unrecognized pathogenicity island. Type 1 fimbriae are expressed by Salmonella as well as most species of bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae (11Duguid J.P. Old D.C. Beachey E. Bacterial Adherence, Receptors and Recognition. 6. Chapman and Hall, Ltd., London1980: 185-210Google Scholar). Although type 1 fimbriae are defined by their capacity to mediate mannose-specific binding reactions, it has become increasingly clear that there exists significant heterogeneity among type 1 fimbriae from different genera and even within the same species in their binding affinities for mannosylated compounds with defined oligomannose motifs. For example, Firon et al. (12Firon N. Ofek I. Sharon N. Carbohydr. Res. 1983; 120: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) have reported a striking difference between the binding specificity of type 1 fimbriae ofS. typhimurium and that of Escherichia coli andKlebsiella pneumoniae type 1 fimbriae. Madison et al. (13Madison B. Ofek I. Clegg S. Abraham S.N. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 843-848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated subtle but distinct differences in binding specificity between recombinant type 1 fimbriae of E. coliand K. pneumoniae. More recently, it has been reported that there is heterogeneity in binding to different mannosylated glycoproteins among type 1 fimbriae of different E. colistrains (14Sokurenko E.V. Chesnokova V. Doyle R.J. Hasty D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These studies have also provided some clues to the underlying molecular basis for the heterogeneity in type 1 fimbrial binding. Whereas Sokurenko et al. (14Sokurenko E.V. Chesnokova V. Doyle R.J. Hasty D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) have linked heterogeneity in the binding among type 1 fimbriae of E. coli to differences in the covalent structure in their adhesin, FimHe, Madison et al. (13Madison B. Ofek I. Clegg S. Abraham S.N. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 843-848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have implicated the fimbrial shaft in defining the fine binding specificity betweenE. coli and K. pneumoniae type 1 fimbriae. In view of the tropism exhibited by Salmonella for gut tissue, the association of type 1 fimbrial expression with virulent strains ofSalmonella, and the heterogeneity in binding specificity among type 1 fimbriae of Salmonella and other enterobacteria, we hypothesized that the type 1 fimbriae of S. typhimurium may play a critical role in modulating bacterial tropism to the gut of the host. By virtue of their distal location on the bacterium and their affinity for specific mannosylated residues, they could determine which tissues are ultimately invaded bySalmonella. We have previously identified the corresponding mannose-binding adhesins on E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Enterobacter cloacae, and we have shown that their sizes ranged between 27 and 29 kDa and that they are antigenically conserved (15Abraham S.N. Sun D. Dale J.B. Beachey E.H. Nature. 1988; 336: 682-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Moreover, the gene encoding the adhesin is invariably at the distal end of the fim gene cluster. The complete DNA sequence of the Salmonella fim gene cluster has been determined by Clegg and Swenson (25Clegg S. Swenson D.L. Klemm P. Fimbriae: Adhesion, Genetics, Biogenesis and Vaccines. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 105-113Google Scholar) (GenBankTMaccession number L19338), and it revealed some striking differences in composition and location of genes with that of other entericfim gene clusters. Based on predicted amino acid sequences of the products of the Salmonella fim gene cluster, it was not possible to identify the fimbrial adhesin. Nevertheless, a gene located in the middle of the fim cluster was namedfimH, because it exhibited limited homology with the adhesin of S fimbriae of E. coli. Thus, in addition to testing the contribution of Salmonella type 1 fimbriae to tissue tropism, we were interested in identifying and characterizing the putative adhesin. Here, we demonstrate that Salmonella type 1 fimbriae mediate bacterial tropism for mouse gut epithelial cells (enterocytes) because, unlike type 1 fimbriae of E. coli, Salmonellatype 1 fimbriae promoted strong bacterial binding to enterocytes but not to bladder epithelial cells. The distinct binding traits ofSalmonella type 1 fimbriae were also reflected in their selective binding to particular mannosylated proteins and in mediating secondary aggregation of bacteria on the surface of enterocytes. Inactivation of a gene (fimHs)encoding a 35-kDa structurally distinct protein (fimHs) located in the middle of the fim cluster resulted in loss of binding activity without any loss of fimbrial expression. Surprisingly, when FimHs was expressed in the absence of other fimbrial proteins, the adhesin bound equally to enterocytes and bladder cells as well as to all mannosylated proteins tested. To see if the fimbrial shaft was responsible for the distinct binding specificity exhibited by the fimbriae, we replaced the amino-terminal half of the FimHs with the corresponding sequence from FimHe, which contained the receptor binding domain of FimHe. The resulting hybrid fimbriae expressed a chimeric adhesin (FimHes) on a shaft comprised ofSalmonella fimbrial protein, and its binding traits resembled that exhibited by Salmonella fimbriae. Our findings suggest that although the adhesin is the structurally distinct FimH, the tropism exhibited by S. typhimurium type 1 fimbriae is determined by the fimbrial filament on which the adhesin is presented.

Lorenz R.G. Gordon J.I. Bian Z. Pfeifer J.D. Normark S.J. Rhen M. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5320-5325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells represent one of the first gut epithelial cell lines of mouse origin to be used to demonstrate adherence of enteric pathogens. These SI-H10 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 20% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 50 units of penicillin/50 μg of streptomycin/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 39 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Immortalized mouse bladder epithelial cells MM45T.BL were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. This assay is based on the principle that live bacteria convert MTT intracellularly to purple formazan in direct proportion to viable bacterial cell number (17Peck R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 82: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The dye MTT (Sigma) is a yellow tetrazolium salt. MTT is reduced by dehydrogenases (expressed intracellularly by the bacteria) to form purple formazan with maximum absorbance at 570 nm. The crystals of formazan that are produced could be observed microscopically in individual bacterial cells and could be quantitated in a multiwell scanning spectrophotometer (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader). This MTT bacterial adherence assay is a new, simple, inexpensive, and rapid colorimetric assay that we have developed in our laboratory to study the adherence of live, metabolically active bacteria. All the bacteria used in this study processed the MTT equally and produced the same amount of formazan. Increasing concentrations of bacteria produced corresponding increases in formazan as measured by A 570. Dead bacteria and paraformaldehyde-fixed enterocytes or bladder epithelial cells do not react with MTT. Cultures of bacteria were grown in static flasks at 37 °C in LB until bacteria were in mid-log phase growth. Bacteria were harvested and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS. The suspensions were adjusted to 1 × 109 bacteria/ml (1 OD), and the suspensions were kept on ice until used. Enterocytes (SI-H10 cells) or bladder epithelial cells (MM45T.BL cells) at a concentration of 0.15 × 106/ml were seeded in a 96-well tissue culture plate and allowed to grow in enriched medium (at 39 °C in the case of SI-H10 cells or 37 °C in the case of MM45T.BL cells) with 5% CO2. Under these conditions, most of the cells attached to the plastic surface of the dish and formed a monolayer. Confluent monolayers were washed three times with sterile PBS and were fixed overnight at 4 °C in sterile PBS containing 1.5% paraformaldehyde. The monolayers were washed three times with sterile PBS and pretreated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS). Various amounts of bacteria were incubated with the monolayers for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence and absence of αmM. Following adherence incubation, nonadherent bacteria were removed by washing the cell monolayer 3 times with PBS. Fifty μl of LB was applied to each monolayer and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. MTT was dissolved in PBS at 2 mg/ml, filter-sterilized, and stored at 4 °C until use. Fifty μl of 2 mg/ml MTT was added to all wells, and the plates were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C to allow reduction of MTT to formazan by live bacteria. The plates were centrifuged for 5 min at 1600 × g to pellet the insoluble formazan-containing bacteria. Fluid from the wells was removed by inverting and gently blotting plates onto absorbent paper. 150 μl of isopropyl alcohol was added to the wells, and the plates were sealed by Sealpette adhesive film (Midwest Scientific, St. Louis, MO) and stored in the dark for 15 min at 37 °C to solubilize the formazan. The remaining formazan crystals were completely dissolved by mixing the well contents before measuring absorbance at 570 nm. All absorbance readings were obtained using an automated 96-channel microtiter plate reader (Bio-Rad) interfaced to a computer. The binding of type 1 fimbriated bacteria to the mannose-containing glycoproteins PAPM-BSA and HRP (Sigma) was studied spectrophotometrically. The cultures of bacterial cells were centrifuged, and the supernatants were removed, and each cell pellet was washed twice in sterile PBS before being resuspended in PBS. 990 μl of each bacterial suspension (absorbance at 600 nm, 1.75) was transferred to a cuvette. Ten μl of the glycoprotein solution at 5 mg/ml concentration in PBS was then added to each cuvette. The cuvettes were covered with Parafilm and shaken gently for 1 min, at which point they were placed into the spectrophotometer, and a reading at 600 nm was taken. As a control, 990 μl of bacterial suspension (absorbance at 600 nm, 1.75) was mixed with 10 μl of PBS. Subsequent readings were taken at 600 nm after a total elapsed time of 5, 15, and every 15 min thereafter for 1 h. The A 600 reading drops as the bacteria aggregate and settle at the bottom of the cuvettes. Aggregation was expressed as absorbance as a function of time. For transmission electron microscopy, bacteria from overnight static liquid cultures were resuspended in PBS. A 25-μl aliquot of the bacterial suspension was placed on top of a parlodion carbon-coated glow discharged grid for 30 s followed by staining with three drops of 1% phosphotungstic acid at pH 7.5. The grids were blotted dry and examined in a Joel 100B electron microscope. For scanning electron microscopy, SI-H10 cells were grown on glass coverslips. The bacterial adherence experiment was carried out with live cells. The cells with adherent bacteria were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS. The coverslips were washed twice with 0.1m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, at room temperature (RT) for 15 min. The cells were then postfixed with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 1 h at RT, followed by two 15-min washes at RT with cacodylate buffer. The cells were then dehydrated with ascending concentrations of ethanol at RT for 10 min at each step: 50, 70, 90, and 100%. The coverslips, in 100% ethanol, were then transferred to a Polaron E3000 Critical Point Drying Apparatus and critical point dried with CO2. Dried coverslips were mounted on aluminum specimen mounts, coated with 300 Å of gold in a Polaron E5000 Sputter Coating Unit, and viewed with a Hitachi S-450 Scanning Electron Microscope at 20 kV accelerating voltage. Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were used as recommended by the suppliers (Boehringer Mannheim; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). A complete list of plasmids that were generated as well as their gene products are described in Table I. ThefimHs gene on the pISF101 plasmid was inactivated by linker insertion mutagenesis. The S. typhimurium fim operon from pISF101 plasmid was released by digestion withSphI and subcloned into SphI-digested pUC 19 vector, and the resulting plasmid was named pKT301. pKT301 was digested with Bsu36I, and the linear DNA was gel-purified. The sequence of the primers that constitute the linker are primer Sty1, 5′ TCA TAA TAA TGA TTA GGT GAG GAT CC 3′, and primer Sty2, 5′ TG AGG ATC CTC ACC TAA TCA TTA TTA 3′. These oligonucleotides were phosphorylated and annealed and then ligated to the Bsu36I-linearized pKT301. E. coli DH5 α F′IQ competent cells were transformed, and the resultant colonies were screened for the introduced BamHI site present on the linker. DNA sequence analysis (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.1-7.87Google Scholar) using the sense strand primer Sty3, 5′ TAT CGG CGC GTC GTT ATT TAG TC3′, and antisense primer Sty4, 5′ AGC AAC CAC AAA GCC TAA AT3′, was carried out on the linker-inserted clones containing theBamHI site. One clone named pKT302, which contained an inactivated fimH s in S. typhimurium fim operon, was used to make the final construct in the pACYC184 plasmid. The mutant operon was subcloned into pACYC184 by digesting the pKT302 plasmid with SphI and by ligating the gel-purified 12-kb mutant operon fragment into SphI-linearized pACYC184. DH5 α F′IQ competent cells were transformed with the ligation mixture, and resultant colonies were screened by SphI andBamHI digestion and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The final construct was named pKT303. The plasmid was introduced into E. coli ORN103 by a method outlined by Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.1-7.87Google Scholar). The plasmid pISF101 that contains the entire type 1fim gene cluster of S. typhimurium was used as the PCR template to generate fimHs DNA sequence. The PCR product was cloned into plasmid vector pMAL-p2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) using standard techniques to produce the plasmid pKT304. The vector pMAL-p2 encodes the affinity tag (MalE protein) and the (Asp)10 linker, which have a molecular mass of approximately 42 kDa. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified commercially (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA). The following are the sequences of the forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers used to generate the fimHs DNA fragment employed in this study: primer Sty5, 5′ GCC GGA ATT CTG CCG TAA TTC AAA CGG GAC G 3′, and primer Sty6, 5′GGG CAA GCT TCT ATT AAT CAT AAT CGA CTC GTA G 3′. Plasmids were introduced into E. coli ORN103 by heat shock method as outlined by Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.1-7.87Google Scholar). Expression vector pMAL-p2, amylose resin, antiserum against the maltose-binding protein (MalE), and purified MalE were obtained from the New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The FimHes chimera-expressing clone was constructed by replacing in the recombinant plasmid pISF101 the S. typhimurium 5′ end region of fimHs gene encoding amino acids 1–174 with corresponding E. coli 5′ end of the fimHe gene encoding amino acids 1–158. The strategy used required introducing two restriction sites (NruI and HpaI sites) in the S. typhimurium sequence just upstream and downstream of the codons encoding amino acids 1 and 174, respectively, of thefimHs gene, and introducing the same restriction sites in the fimHe sequence flanking codons encoding amino acids 1–158. These sites were then used to replace thefimHs sequence with thefimHe sequence. ThefimHes chimera bearing S. typhimuriumtype 1 fimbrial operon was reassembled in pACYC184 with multiple subcloning steps. In order to carry out PCR mutagenesis and to introduce internal NruI andHpaI sites in the fimHs gene, sequential PCR technology was used to generate a fragment of thefim operon from nucleotides 5286 to 6452 in which anNruI site and an HpaI site were introduced at nucleotides 5685 and 6224, respectively. Six PCR primers were designed and purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Primer Sty7, CAGCGTAGTGCCGACAGAGG, is a sense primer located upstream of theAatII site at nucleotide 5379. Primer Sty8, GTCGCGAGCGCGGGATGGGTG, is an antisense primer located at the first site requiring mutation and includes the single base change at nucleotide 5684 to introduce an NruI site. Primer Sty9, CCGCGCTCGCGACGGTTTGCCG, is a sense primer also located at the first mutation site and contains the nucleotide change. These two primers overlap by 13 nucleotides in the region to be mutated. Primer Sty10, CCGGCGTTAACTTCACAGTTTTG, is an antisense primer. It contains two nucleotide changes necessary (nucleotides 6224 and 6227) to introduce an HpaI site. Primer Sty11, TGAAGTTAACGCCGGACAGGTCG, is a sense primer that contains the two nucleotide changes present in primer Sty10 to introduce the HpaI site. Primers Sty10 and Sty11 overlap by 15 bases in the region to be mutated. Primer Sty12, AGCAACCACAAAGCCTAAAT, is an antisense primer, located just downstream of the unique Bsu36I site. Three separate PCR reactions were carried out on the pISF101 DNA template using the above described primers. Primers Sty7 and Sty8 were used in one reaction, primers Sty9 and Sty10 in the second, and primers Sty11 and Sty12 in the third. These three PCR reactions amplified products 404, 556, and 235 bp, respectively. The three PCR products were gel-purified and then all three were combined in a second round of PCR using primers Sty7 and Sty12. This reaction amplified a 1167-bp fragment that was cloned into the pGEM-T vector. Transformants were screened for the presence ofNruI/HpaI fragments of approximately 500 bp. One clone with this phenotype was designated pKT305, and the sequence of the relevant regions was determined. The sequence analysis confirmed the introduction of the NruI and HpaI sites, as well as the integrity of the rest of the relevant S. typhimurium sequences. A DNA fragment of thefimHe encoding the amino acid residues 1–158 was generated from the pSH2 plasmid by PCR using primer Sty13, CTCGCGACGGTTTGTAAAACCGCCAATGGT, and primer Sty14, GTTAACTTCACAGCCGCCAGTAGGCAC, the former containing an NruI site and the latter containing an HpaI site. The 498-bp fragment generated in the PCR reaction was cloned into the pGEM-T vector. Transformants were screened by restriction analysis for the presence of the NruI/HpaI fragment. One clone containing the 498-bp NruI/HpaI fragment was sequenced. The sequence an"

These cytokines drive the assembly of multisubunit receptor complexes, all of which contain at least one molecule of the transmembrane signaling receptor gp130. A complex of IL-11 and the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R) has been shown to interact with gp130, with high affinity, and to induce gp130- dependent signaling. In this study, we have identified residues crucial for the binding of murine IL-11 (mIL-11) to both the IL-11R and gp130 by examining the activities of mIL-11 mutants in receptor binding and cell proliferation assays. The location of these residues, as predicted from structural studies and a model of IL-11, reveals that mIL-11 has three distinct receptor binding sites. These are structurally and functionally analogous to the previously defined receptor binding sites I, II, and III of interleukin-6 (IL-6).

There is structural homology between both the ligands and the receptors of the gp130 cytokine family.

Site I is composed of residues in the carboxyl ends of both the A and D helices and the AB loop, whereas site II is composed of residues in the A and C helices (23Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M.

It has been shown that IL-6 has two distinct regions that are functionally equivalent to sites I and II on hGH (28Brakenhoff J.P. Hart M. De Groot E.R. Di Padova F. Aarden L.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 561-568PubMed Google Scholar). These sites, also termed sites I and II, allow IL-6 to form a trimer with the IL-6R (via site I) and gp130 (via site II), just as hGH forms a trimer with two receptors. The hexameric IL-6 receptor complex described earlier is composed of two of these IL-6·IL-6R·gp130 trimers (13Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Discolo G. Yasukawa K. Hammacher A. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1942-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition to sites I and II, a third topologically distinct site has been identified for IL-6 which allows it to bind to a second gp130 molecule (14Paonessa G. Graziani R. De Serio A. Savino R. Ciapponi L. Lahm A. Salvati A.L. Toniatti C. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1942-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 29Ciapponi L. Graziani R. Paonessa G. Lahm A. Ciliberto G. Savino R.

In this study we identify residues critical for the binding of mIL-11 to the IL-11R and gp130, which provides evidence that IL-11 has three topologically distinct receptor binding sites structurally and functionally equivalent to sites I, II, and III of IL-6. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the cDNA sequence (Genetics Institute) encoding the mature form of mIL-11 (amino acids 1–178). The fragment was then cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using restriction enzymesBamHI and EcoRI. A recognition site for human rhinovirus protease 3C (30Walker P.A. Leong L.E. Ng P.W. Tan S.H. Waller S. Murphy D. Porter A.G. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was introduced by the 5′-primer (the sequence of the primers used is available on request). Cleavage of the glutathione S-transferase-mIL-11 fusion protein with 3C protease produces a protein consisting of amino acids 1–178 of mIL-11 with an extra glycine at the NH2 terminus. This was confirmed by NH2-terminal sequencing. All mutant mIL-11 DNA sequences were created by polymerase chain reaction (31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst .). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6850) Google Scholar) overlap using pGEX-mIL-11 as a template and specific oligonucleotide primers encoding each mutation. The mutant mIL-11 sequences were cloned into pGEX, and the nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing using a sequencing reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer). mIL-11 and all mutants were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in the Escherichia coli strain JM109. The expression, purification, and cleavage of the fusion proteins were carried out as described previously for human leukemia inhibitory factor (32Hudson K.R. Vernallis A.B. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11971-11978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein assay (Pierce). Mutant proteins were also examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis. The structural integrity of the mIL-11 mutant proteins was assessed by their reactivity with two monoclonal antibodies raised against rhIL-11 (kindly donated by Genetics Institute) in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A neutralizing monoclonal antibody (11 h3/19.6.1) served as the capture reagent, and a second biotinylated monoclonal antibody (11 h3/15.6.13) was used as the detector. Dot-blot analysis showed that both monoclonal antibodies preferentially recognized native mIL-11 and not denatured mIL-11, indicating that their reactivity with mIL-11 is conformation-dependent. The construction of the eukaryotic expression plasmids pIG/IL-11R-Fc and pIG/gp130-Fc has been described previously (17Karow J. Hudson K.R. Hall M.A. Vernallis A.B. Taylor J.A. Gossler A. Heath J.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Both the murine IL-11R and murine gp130 were expressed as fusion proteins with the Fc region of human IgG1. The human epithelial kidney 293T cell line (33DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) was used for the transient expression of the pIG constructs, as described previously (17Karow J. Hudson K.R. Hall M.A. Vernallis A.B. Taylor J.A. Gossler A. Heath J.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cell medium containing the Fc fusion proteins was harvested after 6 days. Filtered supernatant was then used either directly in ligand binding assays or for the purification of IL-11R and gp130. Murine IL-11R and gp130-Fc fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using protein A-Sepharose, as described previously (17Karow J. Hudson K.R. Hall M.A. Vernallis A.B. Taylor J.A. Gossler A. Heath J.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Soluble IL-11R and gp130 were cleaved from the Fc portion while bound to the protein A-Sepharose by human rhinovirus 3C protease, as described previously (17Karow J. Hudson K.R. Hall M.A. Vernallis A.B. Taylor J.A. Gossler A. Heath J.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The purified soluble proteins were examined using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The method of mIL-11 biotinylation was adapted from a published procedure (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 341Google Scholar). After purification of mIL-11, buffer exchange to 100 mm borate (pH 8.2) was carried out using NAP-5 Sephadex columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Biotin amidocaproate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) was added to give a 10:1 (biotin:mIL-11) molar ratio. After a 4-h incubation at room temperature NH4Cl (1 mg/250 mg of biotin ester) was added and incubated for 10 min. Biotinylated IL-11 (bIL-11) was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA for 20 h at 4 °C to remove unbound biotin. Maxisorp 96-well plates (Nunc) were coated with protein A (2 μg/ml) overnight at room temperature and then blocked with PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Wells were washed with PBS and incubated with 100 μl of IL-11R-Fc-containing supernatant for a minimum of 2 h. After washing the wells with PBS the plates were used for binding assays. The binding of biotinylated ligands to IL-11R-Fc was measured by adding varying concentrations of the biotinylated ligand to each well. Competition assays between bIL-11 and varying concentrations of nonbiotinylated ligand were also carried out. In all cases binding was left for 4 h at room temperature. The wells were washed in PBS and incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h. After washing with PBS, bound horseradish peroxidase was visualized using orthophenylenediamine as substrate (Dako), and A 490 was determined. Complex formation studies were carried out in a similar manner. As for IL-11R-Fc, gp130-Fc was immobilized on protein A-coated plates. Varying concentrations of biotinylated ligand were then added to each well in the presence of a constant 1 μg/ml soluble IL-11R. After a 4-h incubation at room temperature the amount of biotinylated ligand captured in complex with IL-11R and gp130-Fc was measured using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and orthophenylenediamine substrate, as described above. To assess nonspecific binding, the amounts of biotinylated ligand bound in the absence of either gp130-Fc or soluble IL-11R were also measured. Ba/F3 cells cultured in RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm glutamine, 1 mm streptomycin, and 1 mm penicillin were transfected with BCneo/mgp130 (35Saito M. Yoshida K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 4066-4071PubMed Google Scholar), which encodes the entire open reading frame for mgp130 (35Saito M. Yoshida K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 4066-4071PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then selected on 600 μg/ml G418. Stable Ba/F3-mgp130 transfectants were transfected with pCDNA3/mIL-11R, which encodes the entire open reading frame for mIL-11R (donated by M. Hall) and selected on 100 ng/ml mIL-11. All mutant mIL-11 proteins were tested for biological activity on the Ba/F3-mgp130/mIL-11R cells, using the 3-(4, 5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) proliferation assay as described previously (17Karow J. Hudson K.R. Hall M.A. Vernallis A.B. Taylor J.A. Gossler A. Heath J.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of IL-11 and IL-6 were aligned using the progressive pairwise algorithm of Feng and Doolittle (36Feng D.F. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1987; 25: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar) implemented in the Pileup program of the GCG package. Predictions of secondary structure of mIL-11 were also made using the GCG package. A structural model of mIL-11 was created, from the IL-6 crystal structure coordinates (37Somers W. Stahl M. Seehra J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and the IL-6/IL-11 sequence alignment (with minor manual editing), using the Modeller 4 computer program (38Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10632) Google Scholar). The strategy for mIL-11 mutagenesis was influenced by mutagenesis studies for IL-6 (for review, see Ref.39Simpson R.J. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Matthews J.M. Ward L.D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 929-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and LIF (32Hudson K.R. Vernallis A.B. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11971-11978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A structural model of IL-11, created using the IL-6 crystal structure coordinates (37Somers W. Stahl M. Seehra J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and a sequence alignment of IL-6 and IL-11 combined with predictions of secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and helical wheel projections, was used to identify candidate mIL-11 amino acids for mutagenesis. Multiple alanine substitutions were made to identify those residues important for the binding of mIL-11 to mIL-11R and mgp130. Amino acids located at the carboxyl terminus (Trp-166, Arg-169, Leu-172, Leu-173, and Thr-176) and within the predicted AB loop (Leu-64 and Leu-67) were selected as potential site I residues. Amino acids predicted to be on the exposed surfaces of helices A (Arg-9, Asp-13, Arg-15, Asp-19, and Val-22) and C (Arg-111, Leu-115, Arg-118, and Leu-121) were selected as potential site II residues, and amino acids predicted to lie within the CD loop or the NH2-terminal end of the D helix (Trp-147 and Arg-151) were selected as potential site III residues. Many of the selected residues within each predicted binding site were found to be in close proximity to one another in the structural model of mIL-11. The abilities of the site I mutants to bind to two conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies were examined, as described under “Materials and Methods.” All of the site I mutants exhibited binding similar to that of the wild type protein (results not shown), indicating that the mutations had not significantly disturbed the native conformation of the protein. In the case of the sites II and III mutants, the ability of the mutants to bind to IL-11R-Fc served as a control for protein folding and the structural integrity of the proteins. If a mutant has reduced affinity for one receptor and not the other, it suggests that the mutation has caused a local conformational change rather than effecting the global structure of the protein. The activities of the mIL-11 mutants were assessed using two different assays. First, the ability of each mutant to inhibit the binding of bIL-11 to IL-11R-Fc was measured (Table I and Fig.1 A), and second the ability of each mutant to stimulate the proliferation of Ba/F3-mgp130/mIL-11R cells was measured (Table I and Fig.2 A).Table ISummary of receptor binding and BAF assay data for mIL-11 mutantsWild type or mIL-11 mutantLocation of mutationaThe predicted binding sites of mIL-11 to which each residue is thought to contribute.Ratio IL-11R-Fc bindingRatio BAF stimulationIC50bIC50 refers to the concentration of mutant or wild type protein required to inhibit 50% of the binding of the bIL-11. mutant/IC50mIL-11EC50cEC50 refers to the concentration of mutant or wild type protein to produce 50% maximal stimulation of the BAF cells. mutant/EC50 mIL-11mIL-111.01.0L64A/L67AI50.02.9W166AI3.01.7R169AI>1,000>1,000L172AI50.02.1L173AI10.01.6T176AI0.90.4R9AII0.80.6D13AII1.34.0R15A/D19A/V22AII10.014.0R111A/L115AII0.313.0R118AII1.20.4L121AII1.11.2W147AIII0.7>10,000R151AIII0.94.8a The predicted binding sites of mIL-11 to which each residue is thought to contribute.b IC50 refers to the concentration of mutant or wild type protein required to inhibit 50% of the binding of the bIL-11.c EC50 refers to the concentration of mutant or wild type protein to produce 50% maximal stimulation of the BAF cells.

The mutant R169A showed the most dramatic (in excess of 1,000-fold) reduction in binding to IL-11R-Fc (Table I and Fig. 1 A). Two of the mutants, L64A/L67A and L172A, showed a 50-fold reduction in IL-11R-Fc binding, and others, including L173A and W166A, showed only a weak (less than 10-fold) reduction in binding to the IL-11R-Fc (Table I and Fig.1 A). The mutation T176A had no significant effect on the activity of the protein, suggesting that this residue does not contribute directly to the protein-protein interactions that drive the formation of the signaling complex. In general, those mutants that showed a reduction in IL-11R-Fc binding also exhibited reduced activity in the cell proliferation assay (TableI and Fig. 2 A). The mutant R169A, which showed a dramatic reduction in IL-11R-Fc binding, showed at least a 1,000-fold reduction in biological activity (Table I and Fig. 2 A). The two mutants L64A/L67A and L172A, which showed a 50-fold reduction in IL-11R-Fc binding, exhibited a 2–3-fold reduction in the proliferation assay. In general, the reduction observed for IL-11R-Fc binding was greater than the reduction observed in the proliferation assay. A similar difference in the sensitivity between binding assays and biological assays was also observed for mutants of LIF (32Hudson K.R. Vernallis A.B. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11971-11978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The ability of each mutant to bind to gp130-Fc in the presence of soluble IL-11R was also analyzed (results not shown). It was found that the reduction observed in the IL-11R-Fc binding assay was very similar to those observed in this complex formation assay. In addition, the mutants exhibited greater reductions in activity when assessed in a Ba/F3-mgp130 proliferation assay in the presence of soluble receptor (results not shown) compared with their activities in the Ba/F3-mgp130/mIL-11R proliferation assay, even though the Ba/F3-mgp130/mIL-11R assay was able to detect significantly lower concentrations of ligand. This observation that membrane anchoring of the IL-11R renders the IL-11 receptor complex less sensitive to changes in the affinity of the ligand for the IL-11R has also been reported for the CNTF receptor complex (40Di Marco A. Gloaguen I. Demartis A. Saggio I. Graziani R. Paonessa G. Laufer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23069-23075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The activities of the site II mutants were assessed in both the IL-11R-Fc binding assay and the Ba/F3-mgp130/mIL-11R proliferation assay (Table I and Figs.1 B and 2 B). Most of the site II mutants, including R9A, D13A, R118A, and L121A, showed no significant difference in IL-11R-Fc binding compared with that of the wild type protein (TableI and Fig. 1 B). The mutant R111A/L115A showed a 4-fold increase in affinity for the IL-11R-Fc (Table I and Fig.1 B), suggesting that changing these 2 residues in helix C has somehow altered site I such that the ligand binds to IL-11R with a higher affinity. One of the site II mutants, D13A, which exhibited normal binding to IL-11R-Fc, showed a 4-fold reduction in activity in the cell proliferation assay (Table I and Fig. 1 B). The mutant R111A/L115A, which showed an increased binding affinity for the IL-11R, showed more than a 10-fold reduction in biological activity (Table Iand Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the residues Asp-13 and either or both of Arg-111 and Leu-115 are involved in the interaction between mIL-11 and gp130, as substitution of these residues reduces the ability of mIL-11 to form a signaling complex with gp130 without reducing the affinity of the ligand for the IL-11R. Other mutants, such as R9A, R118A, and L121A, had activities equivalent to wild type mIL-11 in both assays. The mutant R15A/D19A/V22A showed a 10-fold reduction in the IL-11R-Fc binding assay (Table I and Fig. 1 B) which was accompanied by a greater than 10-fold reduction in the cell proliferation assay (TableI and Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that the alanine substitutions in this mutant have altered the global structure of the protein. The activities of the site II mutants D13A, L121A, and R111A/L115A were also assessed by direct binding of biotinylated ligands to the receptor. The abilities of these biotinylated ligands to bind to both IL-11R-Fc and gp130-Fc (in the presence of soluble IL-11R) were measured (Table II and Fig.3) as well as their activities in the Ba/F3-mgp130/mIL-11R proliferation assay. This allowed us to examine the binding of these site II mutants to gp130-Fc (in the presence of soluble IL-11R), which we were unable to do by measuring competitive binding between bIL-11 and the mutants, as the mutant proteins were still able to compete for soluble IL-11R. The biological activities and IL-11R-Fc binding affinities of the biotinylated mutants confirmed the results observed for the nonbiotinylated site II mutants. This served as a control to show that biotinylation had not altered the activity of the mutant proteins. The only biotinylated ligand with activity that differed significantly from that of the wild type was R111A/L1"

We have used different and complementary techniques to study the physical nature and ligand dependence of the complex formed by TβRI and TβRII. Velocity centrifugation of endogenous receptors suggests that ligand-bound TβRI and TβRII form a heteromeric complex that is most likely a heterotetramer. Antibody-mediated immunofluorescence co-patching of epitope-tagged receptors provides the first evidence in live cells that TβRI·TβRII complex formation occurs at a low but measurable degree in the absence of ligand, increasing significantly after TGF-β binding. In addition, we demonstrate that pretreatment of cells with dithiothreitol, which inhibits the binding of TGF-β to TβRI, does not prevent formation of the TβRI·TβRII complex, but increases its sensitivity to detergent and prevents TGF-β-activated TβRI from phosphorylating Smad3 in vitro. This indicates that either a specific conformation of the TβRI·TβRII complex, disrupted by dithiothreitol, or direct binding of TGF-β to TβRI is required for signaling.

Isolation of a TβRI·TβRII complex from detergent lysates was possible only after pretreatment with TGF-β (9Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). Ligand-independent interactions between receptor cytoplasmic domains, however, have been detected in transfected COS cells and in the yeast two-hybrid system, 2R. Perlman and R. A. Weinberg, personal communication. and work with TGF-β2 (which requires both receptors to bind) suggests that at least a small percentage of the cell surface receptor population is in preformed complexes (9Wrana J.L.

Data from experiments on the effect of DTT also raise questions about the role of ligand in the complex. Treatment of cells with DTT prevents TGF-β binding to TβRI but not to TβRII (8Wrana J.L.

Lodish, manuscript in preparation. The stoichiometry of the signaling complex is not known. TβRI and TβRII form ligand-independent homodimers in the endoplasmic reticulum and on the cell surface (21Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The simplest model is that two homodimers form a heterotetrameric signaling complex induced or activated by TGF-β. This view is supported by studies based on functionally complementary type I receptor mutants and on chimeric TGF-β/erythropoietin receptors demonstrating that type I dimers are required for signaling (13Luo K. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4485-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Weis-Garcia F. Massague J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).

They speculate that these are derived from heterotetramers, although their data are also consistent with smaller complexes. We report here studies on the physical nature of the TβRI·TβRII complex. We demonstrate that the complex is most likely a stable heterotetramer. Our studies show conclusively that some TβRI·TβRII complexes exist at the surface of live cells in the absence of ligand, and that TGF-β significantly enhances heterocomplex formation. DTT treatment, which prevents TGF-β binding to TβRI, does not inhibit complex formation but does result in the failure of TβRI from DTT-treated cells to phosphorylate Smad3in vitro. We suggest that ligand binding to the two receptors may have different functions, and that complex formation itself is not sufficient for signal initiation. COS7 (CRL 1651), L6 (CRL 1458), and Mv1Lu (CCL 64) cells were grown as described previously (22Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. J.

Cells were preincubated (30 min, 37 °C) in KRH (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 128 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm KCl) containing 0.5% fatty acid free BSA (KRH/BSA; Sigma). DTT-treated cells were incubated with 2 mm DTT (5 min, 37 °C) and then rinsed three times with warm KRH/BSA. Cells were then incubated (1–4 h, 4 °C) in fresh KRH/BSA with 100 pm125I-TGF-β1. Cross-linking was performed with 0.5 mg/ml disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) for 15 min, followed by quenching with 20 mm glycine. Cells to be used for gradients (Fig. 1) were then rinsed, incubated in 0.2 mm iodoacetamide in KRH (15 min, 4 °C), and lysed in 150 μl of MNT lysis buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, with 2% n-octyl-polyoxyethylene (octyl-POE; Bachem Bioscience)). For co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3), cells were lysed in 1 ml of various lysis buffers (see Fig. 3 legend). After clearing the lysates, 100 μl were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE. The remainder was split in half and immunoprecipitated (overnight, 4 °C) with either 10 μl/ml of antibody α-IIC, a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against the C-terminal 16 amino acids of the type II receptor (11Moustakas A.

One-tenth of each lysate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE without further treatment (not shown); one-half of the remainder was immunoprecipitated with anti-TβRII (α-IIC), and the other half with anti-TβRI (VPN).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The velocity centrifugation technique has been described elsewhere (22Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, cleared lysates (150 μl in MNT lysis buffer) were mixed with 50 μl size markers (29–669 kDa; Sigma) and layered over 7.5–30% sucrose gradients in MNT/1% octyl-POE. Centrifugation was for 8 h, 60,000 rpm, in an SW60 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C. 250 μl fractions were removed sequentially from the top of each gradient. After removal of 25 μl for SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (to analyze migration of markers for each individual gradient), fractions were immunoprecipitated with α-IIC or VPN. Samples were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Autoradiographs were quantified with a LaCie Silverscanner II and MacBAS (Fuji) software. The method used has been described elsewhere (21Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the protocol used (detailed in Ref.21Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), COS7 cells co-transfected with TβRI-Myc and TβRII-HA were preincubated (30 min, 37 °C) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, washed twice with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 1% fatty acid-free BSA, and incubated successively with (a) normal goat IgG (200 μg/ml) to block nonspecific binding; (b) α-Myc F(ab′) (50 μg/ml); (c) F(ab′) of biotinylated GαM (5 μg/ml); (d) F(ab′) of unlabeled GαM (200 μg/ml), used to block all free epitopes on the α-Myc F(ab′); (e) α-HA IgG (20 μg/ml); (f) fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled GαM (20 μg/ml). After fixation (3.2% para-formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, with 1.1% lysine and 0.24% NaIO4) and quenching with 50 mm glycine in PBS (21Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), the cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml Cy3 streptavidin, and mounted with mowiol (Hoechst) containing 29 mm n-propyl gallate (Sigma). Note that membrane proteins retain some lateral mobility after paraformaldehyde fixation, and can therefore be patched by streptavidin because of its super-high binding affinity and multivalent nature. Fluorescence microscopy and digital image acquisition (CC/CE 200 CCD camera, Photometrics) were described (21Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For each field, fluorescein and Cy3 images were taken separately using highly selective filter sets; the two images were superimposed, exported to Photoshop (Adobe) and printed (21Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The construction of cell line Mv1Lu-Flag-N-Smad3, Mv1Lu in which an N-terminally Flag-tagged Smad3 gene was stably expressed, was described elsewhere (28Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). GST-Smad3 (construct provided by Ying Zhang and Rik Derynck) (29Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) protein was prepared from bacterial lysate as described (30Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Mv1Lu cells (Fig.4 A) were incubated in KRH/BSA for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by 5 min with or without 2 mm DTT. They were washed three times with KRH/BSA, and incubated with 100 pmunlabeled TGF-β1 (10 min, 37 °C). Cells were then washed and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO3, 1 mm DTT, 5 mmEDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 10% glycerol). Supernatants were equalized for protein content and incubated with 2 μg of GST-Smad3 (3 h, 4 °C). The GST fusion protein was bound to 10 μl of glutathione beads that were washed three times with lysis buffer, then washed again with kinase buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 12 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT) and subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction with 0.2 mmunlabeled ATP and 50 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (20 μl, 30 °C, 30 min). For Fig. 4 B, lysates from Mv1Lu-Flag-N-Smad3 cells treated similarly were immunoprecipitated with the anti-TβRI antibody VPN (6Franzen P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. Cell. 1993; 75: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), with or without 3 μg/ml competing peptide, before the incubation with GST-Smad3 and [γ-32P]ATP under the above conditions. SDS-containing sample buffer was added, and the samples boiled to terminate the kinase reaction. Samples were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. We studied the size of the cell surface ligand-bound and cross-linked TβRI·TβRII complex using sucrose gradient velocity centrifugation, a technique we used previously to show that both receptors form homodimer-sized complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum (22Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed with octyl-POE, a nonionic detergent with a density of 1 and a high CMC that enables analysis of the migration of detergent-solubilized proteins rather than of micelles (31Garavito R.M. Rosenbusch J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 309-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). 125I-TGF-β1-bound and cross-linked TβRII from COS7 cells transfected with TβRII alone migrated with a peak centered at fraction 7, the position of a 150-kDa marker protein (Fig.1 A, top andbottom panels). Although absolute size determinations can be inaccurate for detergent-solubilized membrane proteins, this is consistent with a homodimer bound to one or more molecules of TGF-β1, as expected from previous gradient analysis and immunofluorescence (21Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar,22Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). TβRII from COS7 cells cotransfected with both TβRI and TβRII (Fig. 1 A, middle and bottom panels) and immunoprecipitated with an antibody against TβRI, thus in a TβRI·TβRII complex, migrated more quickly with a peak centered around fraction 8, indicative of a heterotrimeric or tetrameric complex. L6 rat myoblasts, TGF-β-responsive cells which lack the type III TGF-β receptor, show similar receptor complexes. TGF-β1-bound type I and II receptors immunoprecipitated with an antibody against TβRII both migrated with a peak centered at fraction 10, correlating with markers between 230 and 265 kDa (Fig. 1 B, top andbottom panels), and consistent with a heterotetrameric or trimeric complex. Nearly identical results were obtained with TGF-β2 and with other cell lines, including Mv1Lu, HYB2, THP1, and GH3 (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation with an antibody against TβRI (data not shown) gave similar results, indicating the absence of a significant population of ligand-bound TβRII, which is not in a complex with TβRI. Pretreatment of cells with DTT (Fig.1 B, middle and bottom panels) prevented ligand binding and cross-linking to TβRI and slowed the migration of TβRII to a peak centered around 155 kDa. The DTT-treated complex is likely a dimer (for comparison, see singly transfected COS cells in Fig. 1 A), indicating disruption of the TβRI·TβRII complex under these conditions. DTT does not appear to affect TβRII homodimers, a finding consistent with previous results (21Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The DTT effect appears to be on the cross-linking of ligand to TβRI rather than on cross-linking between TβRI and TβRII, because immunoprecipitation of TβRI from DTT-treated cells following ligand binding and cross-linking showed the absence of ligand-labeled TβRI (Fig. 3). Analogously, ligand binding and cross-linking after DTT treatment either to endogenous TGF-β receptors (20Cheifetz S. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20767-20772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or to COS cells transiently expressing TβRI and TβRII (not shown) failed to reveal TβRI labeling. To study the TβRI·TβRII complex in live cells, we used TβRI and TβRII carrying HA or Myc epitope tags at their extracellular termini for immunofluorescence co-patching, a technique that we developed and have described previously (21Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, a tagged receptor at the surface of live, unfixed cells (in the cold to avoid internalization) is forced into patches by a double layer of bivalent IgGs where the secondary antibody is coupled to one fluorophore (e.g. fluorescein, which emits green fluorescence). A second receptor, containing a different tag, is labeled by antibodies coupled to a second fluorophore (e.g.Cy3, red fluorescence). The cells are examined by fluorescence microscopy to determine whether the two receptors are swept into mutual (yellow) or separate (red or green) micropatches. We have employed this method successfully to demonstrate that all three TGF-β receptors form ligand-independent homodimers (21Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the results of co-patching experiments performed on COS7 cells co-transfected with TβRI-Myc and TβRII-HA. The labeling specificity is high, as shown in a control experiment on cells transfected with TβRI-Myc alone (Fig.2 A, inset); these cells show only Cy3 labeling. In the absence of ligand (Fig. 2 A), 15–20% of the patches were mutual (yellow), although the majority were separate (either green or red). In the presence of 250 pm TGF-β1, the percentage of mutual patches markedly increased to 40–50% (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating that TβRI and TβRII at the surface of live cells have an inherently low probability of forming heterocomplexes that is significantly enhanced by ligand binding. The fraction of a given receptor type in heterocomplexes is proportional to the number of yellow patches divided by the sum of yellow and red (for the red-labeled receptor type) or yellow and green (for green-labeled receptors). These fractions are similar for TβRI and TβRII (23–29% and 57–63% in the absence and presence of ligand, respectively), in accord with a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio in the heterocomplex. Ligand binding and cross-linking to TβRI co-expressed with TβRII is abrogated by DTT pretreatment of cells (Ref. 20Cheifetz S. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20767-20772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1 B,middle panel). DTT treatment, however, did not dissociate the ligand-independent TβRI·TβRII complexes (around 20% co-patching), and did not affect the enhancement of heterocomplex formation by TGF-β1 (around 50% co-patching) (Fig. 2, Cand D). The fraction of each receptor type in yellow patches also remained similar. In contrast to the persistence of TβRI·TβRII heterocomplexes in DTT-treated live cells (Fig. 2, C and D), velocity sedimentation experiments showed that receptor heterocomplexes were disrupted by DTT (Fig. 1 B). We suspected that this disparity resulted from destabilizing effects of the detergent used to solubilize the receptors for velocity sedimentation. We therefore examined the effect of various detergents on TβRI·TβRII co-immunoprecipitation from DTT-pretreated Mv1Lu cells (Fig.3). Immunoprecipitation with an antibody against TβRI (Fig. 3, right panel) was used to assess the integrity of the receptor complex in DTT-treated cells, because TβRII residing in heterocomplexes would still be labeled by ligand and would co-precipitate with TβRI even if the latter was unlabeled. Under the most stringent lysis conditions used (buffers 1–3), there was no co-immunoprecipitation, indicating the absence of intact heteromeric complexes after detergent solubilization. These results hold in different cell lines and with antibodies raised against different type I receptor epitopes (not shown). The same was also true with buffer 4, which was used for the velocity centrifugation experiment in Fig.1 B. With a fifth lysis buffer, however, we detected a small amount of intact TβRI·TβRII complex in the presence of DTT (Fig.3, right panel, buffer 5), suggesting that buffer and detergent conditions determine the integrity of the complex in DTT-treated cells. Together with the demonstration of TβRI·TβRII heterocomplex formation in live cells pretreated with DTT (Fig. 2), these results suggest that DTT treatment alters the conformation of the heterocomplex formed; the altered complex is less stable (as reflected in its increased detergent sensitivity) and most likely has a different conformation, resulting in the failure of ligand binding and cross-linking to TβRI. In epithelial cells, an essential step in TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition and PAI-1 promoter activation is activation of the ability of TβRI to rapidly phosphorylate Smad3 at its C-terminal SSVS motif (28Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Because DTT treatment did not block the ligand-mediated association of TβRI with TβRII, we examined the signaling capability of these complexes as reflected by their ability to phosphorylate Smad3 in vitro. Mv1Lu cells (untreated or pretreated with DTT) were exposed to TGF-β1 to allow heterocomplex formation and activation of TβRI. In one study, lysates from these cells were incubated with recombinant GST-Smad3, and the isolated complex was subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction. In untreated cells (Fig. 4 A,lanes 1 and 2), TGF-β mediated a greater than 20-fold increase in Smad3 phosphorylation; two-dimensional tryptic mapping indicated that this in vitro phophorylation occurred at the same site as in vivo (data not shown). DTT-pretreated cells, however, showed no ligand-induced phosphorylation (Fig.4 A, lanes 3 and 4). Similar results (Fig. 4 B) were obtained by first immunoprecipitating lysates with antibodies against TβRI, then incubating the complexes with a GST-Smad3 fusion protein in an in vitro kinase reaction. Although there is background phosphorylation of the GST-Smad3 construct in this assay, peptide competition during the immunoprecipitation (Fig.4 B, lanes 5–8) eliminates all of the TGF-β-inducible phosphorylation, indicating that TβRI is responsible. Thus, the TβRI·TβRII complex formed after DTT treatment is inactive and cannot mediate the earliest step in TGF-β downstream signaling phosphorylation of Smad3. Our major findings are: 1) TβRI and TβRII form a stable, heteromeric complex, most likely a heterotetramer; 2) in live cells, the two receptors have an intrinsic affinity for each other that is markedly increased by TGF-β exposure; and 3) DTT does not prevent t"
https://openalex.org/W2095448583,"Phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α (eIF-2α) is one of the key steps where protein synthesis is regulated in response to changes in environmental conditions. The phosphorylation is carried out in part by three distinct eIF-2α kinases including mammalian double-stranded RNA-dependent eIF-2α kinase (PKR) and heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI), and yeast GCN2. We report the identification and characterization of a related kinase, PEK, which shares common features with other eIF-2α kinases including phosphorylation of eIF-2α in vitro. We show that human PEK is regulated by different mechanisms than PKR or HRI. In contrast to PKR or HRI, which are dependent on autophosphorylation for their kinase activity, a point mutation that replaced the conserved Lys-614 with an alanine completely abolished the eIF-2α kinase activity, whereas the mutant PEK was still autophosphorylated when expressed in Sf-9 cells. Northern blot analysis indicates that PEK mRNA was predominantly expressed in pancreas, though low expression was also present in several tissues. Consistent with the high levels of mRNA in pancreas, the PEK protein was only detected in human pancreatic islets, and the kinase co-localized with somatostatin, a pancreatic delta cell-specific hormone. Thus PEK is believed to play an important role in regulating protein synthesis in the pancreatic islet, especially in islet delta cells.

Mammalian protein synthesis is promptly adjusted in response to a variety of different environmental stimuli including nutrient starvation, heat shock, and viral infection (1Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 1-30Google Scholar). One of the best studied mechanisms of translational regulation involves the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2α)1 (2Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar, 3Wek R.C. Trends Biochem.

During translation initiation, eIF-2 catalyzes the binding of the initiator Met-tRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit by hydrolyzing GTP to GDP. eIF-2 is released from the ribosome as an inactive form bound to GDP in a binary complex (7Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-70Google Scholar). To participate in the next round of translation initiation, the GDP-bound eIF-2 has to be converted to the active GTP bound form. This is carried out by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF-2B, which is present at a lower molar concentration in the cell. Phosphorylation of eIF-2α results in inhibition of the eIF-2B activity, reducing the rate of nucleotide exchange, thus the rate of polypeptide chain initiation (7Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-70Google Scholar). Eukaryotic protein synthesis is subject to regulation by various conditions where eIF-2α phosphorylation is in parallel with an inhibition of translation initiation (1Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 1-30Google Scholar, 6de Haro C. Mendez R. Santoyo J.

These include the double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase (PKR) (8Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N.S.B. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G.

Genetics. 1998; 149: 1495-1509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinases differ from other families of serine/threonine kinases by the presence of a large insert between domains III and V (20Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). The eIF-2α kinases share extensive homology within the catalytic domains and each of the kinases has been demonstrated to phosphorylate eIF-2α specifically on the Ser-51 residue (2Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar, 5Hinnebusch A.G. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, little homology is found in the regulatory domains of the kinases, which mediate response to different environmental stresses. The presence of distinct regulatory domains within each eIF-2α kinase allows for different physiological signals to regulate phosphorylation of eIF-2α. PKR is regulated by two double-stranded RNA binding motifs located in the N terminus of the protein (6de Haro C. Mendez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1378-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). PKR is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues at very low levels, and expression can be induced by treatment with interferon or upon viral infection (21Samuel C.E. Kuhen K.L. George C.X. Ortega L.G. Rende-Fournier R. Tanaka H. Int. J. Hematol. 1997; 65: 227-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase has been shown to participate in the cellular defense mechanism against viral infection. PKR can be activated by double-stranded RNA generated during the replicative cycle of certain viruses. Activation of PKR results in phosphorylation of eIF-2α and down-regulation of protein synthesis, preventing replication and spread of the virus to neighboring cells. PKR has also been shown to play a role in regulating cell growth and differentiation (22Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 23Williams B.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of HRI is regulated by two heme regulatory motifs, which mediate the inhibition by hemin (24Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The kinase mediates inhibition of protein synthesis in heme-deficient reticulocyte lysates. Although the exact molecular mechanism of such inhibition is not yet fully understood, this inhibition is thought to couple heme availability to synthesis of globin, the major protein in reticulocytes. Interestingly, the HRI kinase is also present in the human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. A large 559 amino acid insert between kinase domain IV and V was identified in the parasite kinase, which distinguishes it from the host kinase (25Mohrle J.J. Zhao Y. Wernli B. Franklin R.M. Kappes B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast to PKR, HRI is predominantly expressed in reticulocytes. Though a low level of mRNA is found in nonerythroid tissues (13Mellor H. Flowers K.M. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the kinase was not detectable in these tissues even under induction by anemia (26Crosby J.S. Lee K. London I.M. Chen J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3906-3914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to PKR and HRI, which are believed to broadly regulate protein synthesis within a given cell type, yeast GCN2 has been shown to specifically regulate expression of GCN4 in response to amino acid starvation (27Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). GCN4 is a transcription factor that coordinately regulates more than 30 genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis in yeast. Whereas activation of PKR and HRI results in inhibition of translation initiation, phosphorylation of eIF-2α by GCN2 leads to induction of GCN4 translation mediated by four short open reading frames in the leader sequence of GCN4 mRNA. Although little is known about the gene-specific nature of translational control in higher organisms, recent cloning of aDrosophila GCN2 homologue (18Santoyo J. Alcalde J. Mendez R. Pulido D. de Haro C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12544-12550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19Olsen D.S. Jordan B. Chen D. Wek R.C. Cavener D.R. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1495-1509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that similar regulatory mechanisms may also exist in higher eukaryotes, such as modulation of translation initiation by short upstream open reading frames of certain eukaryotic genes (28Geballe A.P. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 173-197Google Scholar). Identification of aGCN2 homologue from Drosophila suggests that a homologue may also exist in mammals, as amino acid starvation and defective aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase has been reported to increase eIF-2α phosphorylation in mammalian cells (29Clemens M.J. Galpine A. Austin S.A. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. Duncan R. Hershey J.W.B. Pollard J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 767-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because additional eIF-2α kinases have been implicated in regulating protein synthesis in mammalian cells, not all the responses to stress conditions are accounted for by the PKR and HRI kinases (6de Haro C. Mendez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1378-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 30Hiddinga H.J. Crum C.J. Hu J. Roth D.A.

Consequently, we have recently cloned and characterized a novel eIF-2α kinase from rat pancreas, named PEK, aspancreatic eIF-2α kinase (35Shi Y. Vattem K.M. Sood R. An J. Liang J. Stramm L.E. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7499-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have isolated genomic and cDNA clones encoding human PEK. We demonstrate that the PEK eIF-2α kinase activity is separable from its autokinase activity. We show that the enzyme is specifically expressed in pancreatic islets and co-localizes with somatostatin, a pancreatic islet delta cell-specific hormone. A 2.4-kb human PEK cDNA fragment was generated by PCR amplification using cDNA prepared from human testis (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and oligonucleotide primers (5′-ACAACAAGAATATCCGCAAAA-3′ and 5′-CCAAATGGATTGATTTCAGAA-3′). The 2.4-kb DNA fragment was labeled by [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer-labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.), and used as a probe to screen cDNA Uni-Zap XR libraries (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) prepared with mRNA from human liver, pancreas, and testis. Plaque hybridization and purification was carried out according to a protocol recommended by Stratagene. After purification by two subsequent rounds of screening, the cDNA inserts from positive plaques were subcloned into plasmid pBluescript-SK by in vivo excision from the lambda phages as described by Stratagene. A 740-bp cDNA fragment was labeled by [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer-labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.), and was used as a probe to screen a human genomic library (Stratagene) according to a protocol recommended by Stratagene on plaque hybridization and purification. The 740-bp cDNA fragment was generated by PCR amplification using oligonucleotide primers (5′-GTGACTGTGGAGGACGCTGAGG-3′ and 5′-AATGCCATAACTTTCCAGTCA-3′) derived from the 5′-end of the PEK cDNA, and using plasmid pEST0.9 as DNA template. pEST0.9 is an expressed sequence tag (EST) clone (GenBankTM accession number AA419589) that carries 900 bp of the 5′-end coding region of human PEK cDNA. Isolation and purification of genomic clones was carried out using a Wizard lambda DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Restriction site mapping and Southern blot analysis of the genomic clones were carried out essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, lambda genomic DNAs were digested with a combination of restriction enzymes including SstI,SstII, and KpnI, and the genomic DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. After denaturation in 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5% n NaOH and neutralization with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1.5 m NaCl, the genomic DNA fragments were transferred to a nylon membrane by using a Turboblotter (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with an oligonucleotide (5′-GCCGCTGCTCCCACCTCAGCGACGCGAGTACCGGCGGCG-3′) labeled by [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA hybridization and washing of the membrane was carried out using the same conditions used in cDNA library screening. A 3.0-kb SstI genomic DNA fragment was subcloned into the SstI site of pBluescript-SK, and the resulting plasmid was named pBluescript-hPEK3.0. Oligonucleotide-directedin vitro mutagenesis was carried out using a QuickChange kit (Stratagene) and complementary primers (5′-TGCAATTACGCCATCGCGCGCATCCGTCTCCCAAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTTGGGAGACGGATGCGCGCGATGGCGTAATTGCA-3′) to create a substitution of the amino acid lysine to alanine at position 614 of the rat PEK carried on plasmid pPCRscript-rPEK. The mutant PEK was fully sequenced to verify the amino acid substitution and to ensure that no additional alterations were made. The mutant PEK was excised withEcoRI and KpnI from pPCRscript-rPEK and subcloned into the corresponding sites located on the baculoviral expression vector pFastBac-HTa (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resulting plasmid was named pHTa-K614A. A 4.3-kb cDNA containing the full-length coding region of human PEK and the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions was constructed by subcloning a 200-bp SstI/NotI fragment isolated from pBluescript-hPEK3.0 and a 1.6-kbNotI/EcoRV fragment from pEST4.1 (an EST clone, accession number AA669109) into the SstI andEcoRI sites of pBS-hPITK3.7. The 200-bp, 1.6-kb, and the plasmid pBS-hPITK3.7 carries the 5′-end including the 5′-untranslated region, the middle coding region, and the 3′-end including the 3′-untranslated region of the human PEK, respectively. The resulting plasmid was named pBluescript-hPEK. The 4.3-kb insert was released from the plasmid by restriction digestion with SstI and KpnI and inserted into the corresponding sites in the baculoviral expression vector pFastBac (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resulting plasmid was named pFastBac-hPEK. Generation of recombinant baculoviral clones that express wild type and K614A mutant PEK was carried out using a Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.). DH10Bac competentEscherichia coli (Life Technologies, Inc.) were transformed with pFastBac-hPEK for the wild type PEK or with pHTa-K614A for the mutant PEK. Culture of the Sf-9 insect cells, propagation of recombinant baculovirus, and expression of PEK and mutant K614A proteins in Sf-9 cells were carried out according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The activity of recombinant rat PEK from Sf-9 cell lysate was assessed in immune-complexed kinase assays using recombinant eIF-2α as a substrate. Frozen pellets of Sf-9 cells expressing human PEK and Lys-614 mutant PEK or an unrelated bacterial protein were resuspended in cell lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide, 1× CompleteTM(Boehringer Mannheim)), followed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min to eliminate insoluble material. The supernatants were precleared with 20 μl of rabbit preimmune serum, followed by immunoprecipitation with 20 μl of affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-PEK peptide antibody PITK-289 at 4 °C for 90 min on a rocker. After incubation with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h with rocking, the immune complexes were washed twice with wash buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm benzamidine, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm EDTA) and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The eIF-2α kinase assay was carried out by addition of 1, 2, and 4 μg of purified human eIF-2α and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP to the bead slurry and incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by boiling with equal volume of 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer for 3 min and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography at −70 °C. Immunoprecipitates from the eIF-2α kinase activity assay were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 3% skim milk for 60 min in TBST buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20), the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated with 2 μl/ml purified rabbit anti-PEK antibody PITK-289 for 60 min in the TBST buffer plus 1.5% skim milk. Following a brief wash in TBST buffer, the membranes were incubated for 60 min with 0.3–0.5 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) in TBST buffer plus 1.5% skim milk. Detection of PEK proteins on the membrane was carried out using an ECL detection system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human multiple tissue Northern blots (2 μg of mRNA/lane) were purchased from CLONTECHLaboratories (Palo Alto, CA). A 2.4-kb human PEK cDNA fragment from PCR amplification was labeled by [α-32P]dCTP using a random prime-labeling kit from Life Technologies, Inc. and was used in the Northern blot analyses. Hybridization was carried out in hybridization buffer (2× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% polyvinylpyrolidone, 0.1% Ficoll, 100 μg/ml heparin, and 1 mm EDTA) at 60 °C overnight, followed by three washes at 60 °C in 2x SSC buffer with 0.1% SDS. Expression levels of PEK relative to β-actin was quantified by using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Two polyclonal PEK antibodies, PITK-217 (diluted 1:400) and PITK-289 (diluted 1:200), were used in immunofluorescence microscopy. The antibodies were developed by immunization of rabbits with synthetic peptides derived from two regions of the predicted rat PEK protein sequence. The PITK-217 antibody was directed to a peptide sequence (QMQLCRKENLKDWMNRRCSMEDREHRVCLH) in the kinase subdomain V, and the PITK-289 antibody was directed to a peptide sequence (ENAVFENLEFPGKTVLRQRS) derived from the C terminus of rat PEK. The following antibodies were also used for immunocytochemistry; somatostatin (mouse monoclonal, diluted 1:100, Biogenesis, Sandown, NH), glucagon (rabbit polyclonal, diluted 1:400, Novocastra Lab Ltd., UK), insulin (mouse monoclonal, diluted 1:400, Biogenex, San Ramon, CA), swine anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated immunoglobulins (diluted 1:100, DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA), and rabbit anti-mouse tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated immunoglobulins (diluted 1:100, DAKO Corp.). Isolated rat and human tissues were immersed in 10% formalin for 2 h and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and then immersed in 0.1% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in absolute methanol for 30 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. Immunohistochemical stains were performed using the Elite avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase complex kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The sections were rinsed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with nonspecific serum, and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with rabbit PEK polyclonal antibodies PITK-217 or PITK-289 alone, or together with each of the antibodies to somatostatin, glucagon, or insulin, respectively, in the co-localization studies. After three brief rinses with phosphate-buffered saline, the sections were incubated with swine anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies and rabbit anti-mouse tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies at room temperature for 60 min. The sections were rinsed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and examined by fluorescent microscopy. Multiple human sequences were found to match the rat PEK cDNA sequence when the rat sequence was used as a query to probe the EST data base. Using primers derived from the human EST sequences and cDNA from human testis, we amplified a 2.4-kb cDNA fragment by PCR. Sequence analysis confirmed that the 2.4-kb cDNA fragment represented the C-terminal part of the human PEK, and was used as a probe to screen a cDNA library prepared with mRNA from human liver, pancreas, and testis to obtain full-length human PEK cDNA. Multiple rounds of screening of the libraries resulted in the isolation of a positive clone, which carried a 3.7-kb cDNA insert that represented the longest clone among 20 positives. Sequence comparison with rat PEK confirmed that the 3.7-kb fragment carried the majority of the coding region and 3′-untranslated sequences. A 400-bp sequence that overlaps with the 5′-end of the 3.7-kb sequence was identified from two independent EST clones (GenBankTM accession no. AA419589and AA669109, IMAGE clone 746093 and 827392), which extend the cDNA to 4.1 kb. Despite the cDNA insert of clone 746093 being synthesized by priming at a site closer to the 5′-end of the PEK mRNA, both clones terminated at the same site, indicating a strong secondary structure at the 5′-end of the PEK mRNA. This is confirmed by our effort to extend the 5′-end sequence by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using cDNA prepared from different human tissues including pancreas, liver, testis, and ovary. RACE yielded no additional sequence information on the 5′-end of the PEK cDNA. Genomic cloning was used to clone the rest of the human PEK cDNA. A 700-bp cDNA fragment derived from the 5′-end of the 4.1-kb cDNA fragment was used as probe to screen a lambda FIX II (Stratagene) human genomic library to isolate positive clones that carry the 5′-end of PEK gene. Among more than 20 genomic positives, restriction mapping and Northern blot analyses confirmed that only one clone, G5–2, carried the extreme 5′-end of the cDNA sequence. A 3.0-kb SstI genomic fragment was subcloned from G5–2 into the SstI site of pBluescript-SK. Sequence analyses confirmed that the 3.0-kb fragment did contain the 5′-untranslated sequences and the 5′-end of the coding region of human PEK that overlaps with the 4.1-kb cDNA sequence. Comparison between the 3.0-kb human genomic sequence and the rat PEK cDNA allowed us to extend the cDNA sequence to 4,325 nucleotides, which contains the full-length coding region of human PEK. Sequence analysis indicates that the 4,325 nucleotides encoding the human PEK cDNA contains 72 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence, 3,345 bp of open reading frame, and 908 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence. The sequences flanking the predicted start codon (GACGCTGATGG) partially match the consensus GCC(A/G)CCATGG described for translation initiation sites (37Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The single open reading frame predicts a 1,115-residue polypeptide with a deduced molecular mass of 125 kDa (Fig.1). A hydropathy plot of the protein sequence indicates two highly hydrophobic regions (top paneland boxed sequence, Fig. 1). One of the hydrophobic regions is located at the N terminus, and the other one is located in the middle of the peptide sequence. The N-terminal hydrophobic sequence predicts a signal peptide with 99.5% probability to be a transmembrane region or a leader sequence for secretion (Fig. 1, boxedsequence). The predicted PEK protein shares 88.3% sequence identity and 93.4% similarity with rat PEK. The two homologues mainly differ within the N terminus regulatory domain where three clusters of 2–3 amino acid inserts are present in the human PEK. The two hydrophobic regions, signatures of a membrane protein, are also conserved between the human and rat PEK. The kinase domain of human PEK appears to be more closely related to PKR (43.6% identity) than the other two eIF-2α kinases, HRI (37.2% identity) and yeast GCN2 (34.2% identity). In contrast, the 550-residue N-terminal segment of the PEK is quite distinct, presumably reflecting the different physiological signals that regulate its activity. From a search of the protein data bases, the only sequence that shows homology to the regulatory domain is with an uncharacterized kinase recently identified from C. elegans. The predicted C. elegans polypeptide is 1,085 (GenBankTM accession no. Z66563) residues in length and shares 28.5% identity and 52.2% similarity with human PEK. In contrast to restricted homologies within the kinase domain with HRI, PKR, and GCN2, PEK shares homologies with the C. eleganspolypeptide in highly homologous clusters that span the entire molecule. Two of the highly conserved regions are shown in Fig.2. The nematode kinase may differ from the mammalian counterpart in subcellular localization, as the two hydrophobic regions of human and rat PEK are not found in the C. elegans kinase. The distinct homology shared between human PEK and other eIF-2α kinases suggest that PEK is a novel eIF-2α kinase. To verify whether human PEK exhibits eIF-2α kinase activity, we assembled a full-length cDNA encoding human PEK and expressed the cDNA in Sf-9 insect cells.

Depolarization-induced calcium influx into islet cells has been shown to stimulate glucagon gene transcription through the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein that binds to the glucagon cAMP response element. By transient transfection of glucagon-reporter fusion genes into islet cell lines, this study identified a second calcium response element in the glucagon gene (G2 element, from −165 to −200). Membrane depolarization was found to induce the binding of a nuclear complex with NFATp-like immunoreactivity to the G2 element. Consistent with nuclear translocation, a comigrating complex was found in cytosolic extracts of unstimulated cells, and the induction of nuclear protein binding was blocked by inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase activity by FK506. A mutational analysis of G2 function and nuclear protein binding as well as the effect of FK506 indicate that calcium responsiveness is conferred to the G2 element by NFATp functionally interacting with HNF-3β binding to a closely associated site. Transcription factors of the NFAT family are known to cooperate with AP-1 proteins in T cells for calcium-dependent activation of cytokine genes. This study shows a novel pairing of NFATp with the cell lineage-specific transcription factor HNF-3β in islet cells to form a novel calcium response element in the glucagon gene.

Like neurons, endocrine cells of the pancreatic islets are electrically excitable and express L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (7Yaney G.C. Wheeler M.B. Wei X. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L.

By virtue of stimulation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver, the islet hormone glucagon is an important regulator of blood glucose levels (9Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 1518-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Glucagon-producing islet cells show spontaneous electrical activity (10Rorsman P. Hellman B. J. Gen Physiol. 1988; 91: 223-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Membrane electrical activity and calcium influx into glucagon-producing pancreatic islet cells is tightly controlled by extracellular messengers. Whereas l-arginine increases spike frequency (10Rorsman P. Hellman B. J. Gen Physiol. 1988; 91: 223-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), β-adrenergic cell-surface receptor stimulation by catecholamines through cAMP enhances the L-type calcium current, increasing the influx of calcium associated with each action potential (11Rorsman P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is well known that membrane depolarization and calcium influx increase the cytosolic free calcium concentration, which stimulates hormone secretion by exocytosis (8Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Johansson H. Gylfe E. Hellman B. Cell Calcium. 1989; 10: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The question is whether, and if so, how, this calcium signal reaches also into the nucleus and regulates gene transcription. Previous experiments have shown that membrane depolarization and calcium influx stimulate glucagon gene transcription (3Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mechanism involved has been characterized. Through a calcium-/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase calcium stimulates the phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB on the same serine residue that is also phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. CREB binds to a CRE in the 5′-flanking region of the glucagon gene and stimulates transcription (3Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol.

By the results obtained, the G2 element is identified as a second calcium response element. The further characterization suggests that calcium responsiveness is conferred by the calcium/calcineurin-regulated transcription factor NFATp functionally synergizing with the cell-specifically expressed transcription factor HNF-3β. NFAT family proteins are known to cooperate with newly synthetized AP-1 proteins in T cells (16Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A.

Cells were trypsinized and transfected in suspension by the DEAE-dextran method (3Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol.

Rous sarcoma virus-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid (0.4 μg/6-cm dish) was added as a second reporter to check for transfection efficiency. When indicated, 0.7 μg of pBK-CMV-NFATpDBD was co-transfected per 6-cm dish; these co-transfections were done with a constant DNA concentration, which was maintained by adding Bluescript (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were stimulated with high KCl (45 mm final concentration) or TPA (300 nm) for 6 h before harvest. FK506 (167 nm, unless noted otherwise) was added 1 h before stimulation. Cell extracts (3Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared 48 h after transfection. A chromatographic chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay was performed as described previously (30Knepel W. Jepeal L. Habener J.F. J. Biol.

Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar), except for the experiments shown in Fig. 3 G. In the experiments shown in Fig. 3 G, separate nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared as described previously (32McCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E.

Synthetic complementary oligonucleotides with 5′-GATC overhangs were annealed and labeled by a fill-in reaction with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow enzyme. By using 15 μg of protein from cell extracts, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described by Klemsz et al. (35Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). In some binding reactions, a specific anti-NFATp antiserum (kindly provided by A. Rao, Harvard Medical School, Boston) was used. This antiserum (anti-67.1) is directed against the 67.1 peptide of murine NFATp; it does not cross-react with NFATc, NFAT3, or NFATx (36Ho A.M. Jain J. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28181-28186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts were incubated with 1 μl of a 1:10 dilution of preimmune serum or anti-NFATp antiserum in the reaction buffer with probe for 15 min at room temperature. Following a 15-min incubation on ice, the samples were loaded onto the gels and electrophoresed as described above. The sequences of the G2 oligonucleotides (wild type and mutants 1, 3, and 5) were as described previously (20Fürstenau U. Schwaninger M. Blume R. Kennerknecht I. Knepel W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1805-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and read as follows (only one strand with the 5′-GATC overhang is shown, and mutated bases are underlined): G2, 5′-GATCCAGGCACAAGAGTAAATAAAAAGTTTCCGGGCCTCTGA-3′; G2 m1, 5′-GATCCAGGCACAGTTCGAAATAAAAAGTTTCCGGGCCTCTGA-3′; G2 m3, 5′-GATCCAGGCACAAGAGTAAATAAGGGATTTCCGGGCCTCTGA-3′; G2 m5, 5′-GATCCAGGCACAAGAGTAAATAAAAAGTTTGGGGGCCTCTGA-3′. The sequence of the oligonucleotide (NFATcons) containing a well characterized NFAT-binding site was as described (36Ho A.M. Jain J. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28181-28186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except thatBamHI (upstream) and BglII ends (downstream) with 5′-GATC overhangs were added. Poly (A)+ RNA was extracted from αTC2 cells using a commercial kit (Fast Track 2.0TM, Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using a commercial kit (Gene AmpTM Thermostable rTth Reverse Transcriptase RNA PCR Kit, Roche Molecular Systems) with primers and PCR reaction conditions as follows: upstream primer 5′-AGTCCCCAAGACGAGCT-3′, downstream primer 5′-CGGGCTCAGAAAGTTCTGG-3′; 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, 45 s at 72 °C, for 34 cycles; the expected product is 234 base pairs long. After agarose gel electrophoresis, the product obtained was verified by extraction, subcloning (pCR© 2.1, Invitrogen), and cycle sequencing (Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit, Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany; M13 fluorescent primer). Nuclear extracts were resolved on a 5.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, incubated for 2 h in 10% nonfat dry milk dissolved in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20), incubated for 1 h in 2% gelatin dissolved in TBST, and then incubated with anti-NFATp antiserum (anti-67.1) (36Ho A.M. Jain J. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28181-28186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), diluted 1:3,000 in TBST, overnight at 4 °C. Antibody-antigen complexes were detected with ECL reagents (Amersham). Using the same samples, immunoblots were performed with an anti-CREB antiserum as has been described previously (15Schwaninger M. Blume R. Krüger M. Lux G. Oetjen E. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8860-8866Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A stock solution of TPA (1 mm) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and further diluted in cell culture medium. FK506 (provided by Fujisawa) was dissolved in ethanol. Controls received the solvent only. To study the calcium responsiveness of the glucagon gene in the absence of a functional CRE, the CRE in the 5′-flanking region of the rat glucagon gene was removed by either 5′-deletion to −292 or by internal deletion of four bases within the CRE octamer motif, yielding the constructs −292GluLuc and −350(−297/−292)GluLuc, respectively (Fig.1). The corresponding glucagon-reporter fusion genes were transiently transfected into two pancreatic islet cell lines, HIT and αTC2. These cell lines have been used previously to demonstrate that membrane depolarization and calcium influx induce glucagon gene transcription through the CRE of the glucagon gene (3Schwaninger M.

Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and have the advantage to respond to second messenger stimulation and to be well characterized with respect to electrical activity, voltage-dependent calcium channels, cytosolic calcium concentration, and secretion (see Ref. 3Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increases in extracellular potassium concentration to 40 mm have been shown to depolarize HIT cells with action potentials continuing at the peak of the depolarizing phase of the spontaneous activity; at the same time, high potassium initiates the influx of calcium through dihydropyridine-sensitive, L-type Ca2+ channels in the cell membrane and elevates the cytosolic calcium concentration (39Keahey H.H. Rajan A.S. Boyd III, A.E. Kunze D.L. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 188-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane depolarization was induced by elevating the potassium chloride concentration in the incubation medium from 5 to 45 mm. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the high potassium-induced increase in glucagon gene transcription was decreased in HIT cells by 77% by the 4-base deletion in the CRE octamer motif, as has been reported previously (3Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was decreased by 46% when the CRE was removed by 5′-deletion to −292 (Fig. 1 B). Basal reporter activity was not changed by these deletions (data not shown). Thus, although the depolarization-induced increase in glucagon gene transcription was reduced using both constructs, glucagon gene transcription did still respond to membrane depolarization, resulting in a 2.0- and 3.3-fold stimulation of transcription in the absence of the CRE, respectively (Fig. 1 B). After transfection of −292GluLuc, the stimulation of transcription by high potassium was abolished when extracellular calcium was bound by 1.5 mmEGTA added to the medium (data not shown), suggesting that gene induction by membrane depolarization depends on calcium influx elevating intracellular calcium levels. The pancreatic α-like cell line αTC2 has been established from a glucagonoma arising in transgenic mice expressing the SV40 large T-antigen oncogene (28Powers A.C. Efrat S. Mojsov S. Spector D. Habener J.F. Hanahan D. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29Hamaguchi K. Leiter E.H. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 415-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells express predominantly glucagon in a rather uniform pattern (28Powers A.C. Efrat S. Mojsov S. Spector D. Habener J.F. Hanahan D. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In αTC2 cells, the depolarization-induced stimulation of glucagon gene transcription was only slightly reduced by 5′-deletion to −292 or by the internal deletion of four bases within the CRE octamer (Fig. 1 C). When compared with −350GluLuc, basal reporter activity of −350(−297/−292)GluLuc was not changed, and basal reporter activity of −292GluLuc was reduced to 38 ± 7% (n = 12). The results obtained in both pancreatic islet cell lines thus indicate that besides the CRE the rat glucagon gene 5′-flanking region contains at least one more calcium-responsive element within 292 bases in front of the transcription start site. Known elements within the enhancer region of the glucagon gene include the G2 element (20Fürstenau U. Schwaninger M. Blume R. Kennerknecht I. Knepel W. Mol. Cell.

Knepel W. Endocrine. 1994; 2: 833-839Google Scholar) (Fig.2). To study their role, four copies of oligonucleotides containing the G2 element (from −200 to −165), the G3 element (from −274 to −234), or the CS element (from −241 to −212) were placed in front of the truncated viral thymidine kinase promoter of herpes simplex virus (from −81 to +52) fused to the luciferase reporter gene (plasmid pT81Luc) (21Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the promoter alone did not respond to membrane depolarization in αTC2 cells. The G3 element and the binding site for C/EBP proteins were also inactive (Fig. 2). However, the G2 element did confer depolarization responsiveness to the promoter (Fig. 2). The blocker of L-type, voltage-dependent calcium channels, diltiazem, inhibited the high potassium-induced transcriptional activation of the G2 element (data not shown). Depolarization responsiveness conferred by the G2 element to the nonresponsive thymidine kinase promoter was only somewhat less than that conferred by the glucagon CRE. When in separate experiments the plasmids 4xG2T81Luc and 4xGluCRET81Luc were transfected in parallel into αTC2 cells, membrane depolarization stimulated transcription to 182 ± 14% of controls (n = 6) through the G2 element and to 225 ± 18% of controls (n = 6) through the glucagon CRE. These data indicate that the G2 element is a calcium-responsive element of the glucagon gene. The G2 element has been shown before to confer cell-specific basal activity (20Fürstenau U. Schwaninger M. Blume R. Kennerknecht I. Knepel W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1805-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 40Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1805-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to the glucagon gene. The binding of two transcription factors is required for both of these activities in αTC2 cells, HNF-3β and an Ets-like protein (20Fürstenau U. Schwaninger M. Blume R. Kennerknecht I. Knepel W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1805-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of HNF-3β in the islet-specific, basal transcriptional activity of G2 remains to be defined (20Fürstenau U. Schwaninger M. Blume R. Kennerknecht I. Knepel W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1805-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 41Philippe J. Morel C. Prezioso V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3514-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To study the effect of membrane depolarization and calcium influx on nuclear protein binding to the G2 element, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed. Nuclear extracts were prepared from pancreatic islet αTC2 cells with or without stimulation by membrane depolarization. It has been shown previously that under basal nonstimulated conditions band h (Fig.3 A) represents the binding of HNF-3β, whereas several weak bands collectively labeled e(Fig. 3 A) represent proteins with a binding specificity related to the Ets family of transcription factors (20Fürstenau U. Schwaninger M. Blume R. Kennerknecht I. Knepel W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1805-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Membrane depolarization for 15 or 120 min induced the binding of a protein complex that migrated among the bands e (Fig. 3 A, marked by an arrow). Whereas the intensities of some bands e varied somewhat between the experiments, the depolarization-induced nuclear protein binding was consistently observed (Fig. 3,A–F). The binding specificity of the depolarization-induced protein complex was studied using G2 mutants. The depolarization-induced nuclear protein complex did bind to labeled mutant 1 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7 and 8) but not to labeled mutant 5 (Fig.3 B, lanes 11 and 12). In mutant 1 and mutant 5, 5 and 2 bases, respectively, have been mutated that are required for the binding of HNF-3β and the Ets-like proteins, respectively (see Ref. 20Fürstenau U. Schwaninger M. Blume R. Kennerknecht I. Knepel W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1805-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; see also top of Fig.3 A). Consequently, band h was not formed when G2 mutant 1 was used as probe, and bands e were not detectable when G2 mutant 5 was used as probe (Fig. 3 B). This indicates that the depolarization-induced nuclear complex binds to a site within G2 that is distinct from the HNF-3β-binding site; in contrast, the two guanine bases (noncoding strand) exchanged in mutant 5 are essential for binding (see top of Fig. 3 A). The binding specificity was further characterized in competition experiments using G2 wild type, mutant 1, mutant 5, and also mutant 3. In mutant 3, 4 bases have been mutated (see top of Fig.3 A). As shown in Fig. 3 C, the binding of HNF-3β (band h) was competed away by mutants 5 and 3 but not by mutant 1, which carries mutations within the HNF-3β-binding sequence. In contrast, mutant 1 competed for the binding of the depo"

Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The mutator phenotype of strains with an inactivated mutS gene is consistent with this idea (2Horst J.P. Wu T.H. Marinus M.G. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 29-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition MutS also participates in homeologous recombination, transcription-coupled repair, very short patch repair, resolution of directly repeated DNA sequences, and sensitivity tocis-platin and alkylating agents (3Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 4Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 5Umar A. Kunkel T.A. Eur. J.

MutS binds specifically to mismatched base pairs and insertion/deletion mispairs of up to four nucleotides as well as adducted base mismatches (7Su S.S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 8Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The DNA-bound MutS protein binds ATP and in association with dimeric MutL can form α-looped structures with concomitant hydrolysis of ATP, suggesting movement of the protein complex on DNA away from the mismatch (9Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). An alternative model suggests that ADP stabilizes DNA binding and ATP increases dissociation (10Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). After addition of MutH, the MutSLH complex cleaves DNA 5′ to hemimethylated -GATC- sequences in the unmethylated strand. Subsequent excision repair from this nick can occur in either direction by one of several exonucleases, and directionality is imparted through interaction of the MutLS complex with helicase II, the uvrD gene product (11Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Resynthesis of the gapped DNA is accomplished by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and subsequent ligation by DNA ligase. The basic elements of the scheme outlined above have been conserved in eukaryotes (3Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 4Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 5Umar A. Kunkel T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This includes MutS and MutL homologues, each of which shows conservation with the E. coli protein at the amino acid level. Unlike bacteria, however, multiple MutS (MutS homologue) and MutL (MutL homologue, postmeiotic segregation) homologs are present as heterodimers in eukaryotes. Mutation in these genes results in microsatellite sequence instability and may dispose individuals to hereditary or sporadic cancer, especially colon carcinoma. The mechanism for strand discrimination during the repair process in eukaryotes is unknown. At present, there is no structural information for any MutS homologue. The amino acids that are important for specific and nonspecific contact with DNA are not known. Similarly the residues important for dimerization and contacting MutL are unknown. To identify which regions of MutS are essential for these functions, we have made specific deletions in the mutS gene and have examined the properties of the truncated proteins. The results obtained with the E. coli protein should be applicable to other members of the MutS family given their overall amino acid conservation (4Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Strain E. coli K-12 GM5864 is GM4271 lysogenized with phage λDE3. GM4271 is a mutS458::mTn10Kan derivative of CC106 (12Wu T.H. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5393-5400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown in L broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and/or 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The methods for determining mutation frequency to rifampicin resistance or Lac+ papillation have been described previously (12Wu T.H. Marinus M.G. J.

Plasmid pMQ372 is a pET3d (Novagen) derivative that contains the wild-type mutS gene and lacks theAvaI site of pET3d. pMQ395 is derived from pMQ372 but contains the N-terminal His6 tag of pET15b fused to themutS coding sequence. Plasmids pMQ372 and pMQ395 fully complement the mutS458 mutation in strain GM4271, as determined by monitoring for spontaneous mutation to rifampicin resistance, even in the absence of T7 RNA polymerase induction (see Table II). Plasmids pMQ382 and pMQ393 are derivatives of pACYC184 and carry His6-tagged mutS and mutL,respectively (12Wu T.H. Marinus M.G. J.

Bacterial strains containing the plasmids listed above were grown to saturation in duplicate in L broth with ampicillin but without IPTG. Portions of the cultures were diluted, if necessary, and spread on plates containing ampicillin or rifampicin. The plates were scored after overnight incubation at 37 °C. Deletions in the E. coli mutS gene were made in pMQ372 at naturally occurring restriction enzyme recognition sites, with appropriate endonucleases (New England Biolabs), to produce derivatives with promoter-proximal, promoter-distal, or midgene mutations (see Fig.1). The fusion joint for each deletion end point is shown in TableI. The method of constructing the deletion at the SspI site resulted in the addition of 13 additional amino acids to the mutant protein. Mutations from the pMQ372 series were moved into pMQ395 by fragment swapping to generate proteins with an N-terminal His6 tag. The His6 tag wild-type and deleted mutant proteins were prepared as recommended by the manufacturer (Novagen) in strain GM5864. Although the specific conditions for culturing cells varied for each construct, in general GM5864 transformed with a pMQ395 mutant derivative was grown at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.8, shifted to room temperature, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG)1 was added to 50 μm final concentration. Incubation was continued for 2–3 h at room temperature, and the cells were harvested and lysed in a French pressure cell (Aminco) in lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl) followed by a brief sonication to reduce viscosity. The lysate was centrifuged in a Beckman Ti70 rotor at 39,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by filtration through a 0.45-μm syringe filter (Acrodisc). His6 tag protein was bound to and eluted from nickel-affinity resin (His-Bind, Novagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. At least 80% of the wild-type and 10–30% of the mutant MutS were recovered as soluble protein. All proteins were at least 95% pure as judged by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of polyacrylamide gels and by Western blotting (e.g. see Fig. 4). Protein concentration was assayed using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). ATPase activity was assayed by the method of Weinstock et al. (13Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8829-8834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and percent [α-32P]ATP hydrolysis was measured by scanning polyethyleneimine chromatography plates using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager equipped with ImageQuant software.Figure 4Analyzing MutS-MutL interaction by affinity chromatography.

B, for each plasmid construct, fractions eluting at 30, 50 (two), and 80 mm (two) from the affinity column were tested for MutS immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE. As a control, MutL immunoblotting was also carried out on each fraction and is shown below that for MutS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A 154-bp DNA oligonucleotide with a centrally located G-T mismatch at bp 76 was constructed as follows. Oligonucleotides MM181 (86-mer, 5′-CGGCGATATTCTAG ACACAGGCGATGGTTTTGATAGAGCATCTTGGACGATTTGTAACAACTCGGAGTTCATAGATCTCCCATTCG-3′) and MM186 (92-mer, 5′-AGAGGATCCGCACTTTAACTTCCGTATGCCTATGGAAGTCAGAGAGAAATTAAAATTCAGAGCGGAGGCGAATGGGAGGTCTATGAACTCCG-3′) were synthesized by Dr. Kendall Knight (University of Massachusetts Medical School). The underlined bases are complementary, and the mismatched bases are in bold. The DNA sequence of these oligonucleotides is derived from the phage P22 mnt gene (14Wu T.H. Clarke C.H. Marinus M.G. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were mixed, annealed in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2 at 70 °C for 10 min, and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The single-stranded regions were converted to duplex DNA in the presence of dNTPs and [α-32P]dATP (800 Ci/mmol) and DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs) in reaction buffer supplied by New England Biolabs. Following the reaction, labeled double-stranded DNA was recovered after passage through a Qiaquick (Qiagen) column. Binding of MutS to heteroduplex DNA was measured by band shifting in polyacrylamide gels as described previously (8Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To measure MutS heterodimer interaction, strain GM5864 was transformed with pMQ382, encoding wild-type His6-tagged MutS, and with a pMQ372 mutSdeletion derivative. MutS-MutL interaction utilized strain GM5864 transformed with pMQ393, which encodes wild-type His6-tagged MutL, and with a pMQ372 mutSdeletion derivative. For the His6-tagged derivatives listed in Fig. 1, the same procedure was used except that the wild-type MutS was not His6-tagged. The strains were grown toA 600 of 0.7 at 37 °C (no IPTG was added) and harvested, and His6-tagged proteins were isolated as described above. A portion of each fraction from the affinity column was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting on Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) after semi-dry electroblotting (Owl Scientific) employed rabbit polyclonal antiserum to MutS and MutL (BAbCO) using chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's (Tropix) instructions. The amino acids important for MutS dimerization, for binding to heteroduplex DNA, and for interaction with MutL are not known. We have constructed deletion derivatives in the E. coli mutS gene to determine whether these functions can be localized to specific regions of the MutS protein. Because ATP binding and/or hydrolysis is necessary for heteroduplex DNA-induced MutS conformational change (15Alani E. Sokolsky T. Studamire B. Miret J.J. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2436-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) as well as movement of MutS along the heteroduplex DNA (9Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and for MutS-MutL interaction (16Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we constructed deletion mutations in themutS gene that retained the coding sequence of the P-loop motif for nucleoside triphosphate binding (between the HpaI and SspI sites in Fig. 1). All mutant proteins derived from the deletion constructs had similar low ATPase activity (about 0.34 μm ATP hydrolyzed/μm MutS/min) as the wild type. Plasmids containing the wild-type and mutantmutS deletion alleles were introduced into wild-type andmutS E. coli strains. The presence of the plasmids in the wild-type strain did not significantly alter the mutation frequency to rifampicin resistance (Table II) or the frequency of Lac+ reversion as measured by papillation (less than 1% of colonies showing one or more papillae). Similarly the plasmids did not significantly alter the mutation frequency of themutS strain to rifampicin resistance (Table II) or Lac+ papillation (>90% of cells showing papillation). The deletion mutations, therefore, inactivate the protein for genetic complementation and do not show dominance in the wild type. MutS protein binds specifically to base mismatches and insertion/deletions in DNA (7Su S.S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 8Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The wild-type and deletion mutant proteins were tested for their ability to bind to a 154-bp heteroduplex containing a G-T mismatch at position 76 by monitoring bandshifting in polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2). The wild-type protein bound the radioactive substrate oligonucleotide efficiently at low concentration, and apparent binding was decreased by 85% in the presence of a 50-fold excess of non-radioactive competitor DNA (Fig.2). At a wild-type protein concentration that resulted in complete loss of the free oligonucleotide band, mutant proteins produced by pΔ680–853H, pΔ26–260H, pΔ261–556H, and pΔ1–311H showed 9-, 44-, 87-, and 100-fold reduction in specific binding, respectively (Fig. 2). These data indicate that the N-terminal end of the MutS protein is essential for substrate binding. MutS protein is a dimer in solution (7Su S.S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We have used an in vivo assay to test for the ability of mutant proteins to dimerize with wild-type MutS. Compatible plasmids were used to express His6-tagged wild-type and native mutant proteins in the same cell. His6-tagged protein was purified from cell lysates and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were blotted to a membrane and probed with MutS antiserum. If mutant-wild-type heterodimers are formed, then two reactive bands, at different molecular weights, should be present (Fig.3 A). Expression of the wild-type His6-tagged MutS gene in the presence of the compatible plasmid vector produces predominantly a single protein band distribution at the predicted wild-type M r in eluates from the nickel column (Fig. 3 B, vector). A similar result was obtained if both His6-tagged and non-tagged wild-type proteins were present in cell extracts (Fig.3 B, pMQ372). We assume the lower molecular weight band in these two figures is because of protein degradation. The distribution of wild-type and mutant proteins in eluates from the affinity column was similar if not identical for pΔ261–556 and pΔ1–260 encoded mutant proteins, indicating efficient heterodimer formation in vivo. Deletion of the N-terminal region of MutS encompassed by these two mutations (Fig. 1) therefore does not affect dimerization. For the pΔ680–853 and pΔ261–566 encoded proteins, however, the distributions of wild-type and mutant proteins were not the same (Fig. 3), indicating less efficient heterodimer formation. The basis for the altered distribution of the mutant proteins is unknown. These mutant proteins are as stable and soluble as those made from pΔ261–556 and pΔ1–260, suggesting that lack of heterodimer formation is not because of these causes. None of the mutant non-His6-tagged MutS proteins bind to the affinity column (data not shown). The results suggest that amino acid residues in the C-terminal end of the protein are responsible for efficient dimerization. MutS protein bound to heteroduplex DNA is thought to recruit MutL protein into a complex (16Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have been unable to detect MutS-MutL complexes by co-immunoprecipitation. 2T-H. Wu and M. G. Marinus, unpublished data. We have used, instead, a variation of the technique to detect dimerization in which His6-tagged MutL was co-expressed in vivo with non-His6-tagged MutS. Affinity purification of MutL followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with MutS antibody should allow for detection of MutS-MutL complexes (Fig.4 A). The control experiments showed that a band at the expected M r was detected in cells expressing MutS (Fig. 4 B,pMQ372) but was not detected in its absence (Fig.4 B, vector). Reduced amounts of mutant MutS were detected in cells containing the C-terminal and midgene mutSdeletions (Fig. 4 B, pΔ680–853 andpΔ261–566). One mutation deleting the N-terminal end produced almost as much cross-reacting material as wild-type (Fig. 4 B, pΔ1–260) whereas another resulted in a vast excess of it (Fig. 4 B,p/Δ26–260). We assume the latter result indicates a higher affinity of the mutant protein for MutL than wild type or binding of more MutS molecules to MutL than normal. The results above suggest that the MutS-MutL interaction region is at the C-terminal end of MutS, perhaps overlapping with the P-loop domain of the ATP binding site (Fig. 1). The mutant proteins we have used all have approximately the same ATPase specific activity as the wild-type MutS protein, suggesting that gross structural alterations are not present. This is supported by the observation that the mutant proteins are able to dimerize and to interact with MutL unless specifically defective in one or both of these processes. The mutS deletion mutations produce little, if any, residual mismatch repair in vivo, and they do not impart a dominant phenotype in a wild-type strain (Table II). The latter finding is surprising for those mutant proteins, such as pΔ1–311, that fail to bind DNA but still interact with downstream proteins. It should be noted that IPTG was not added to the cultures to induce the phage T7 RNA polymerase because the wild-type mutS plasmids complemented the mutator phenotype in its absence (Table II) and because the plasmid instability increased in its presence. Perhaps the ratio of mutant protein to wild type is low in vivo in uninduced cultures because of a lower than expected level of expression and/or poor solubility of the mutant proteins, thereby precluding sequestration of sufficient wild-type and mutant monomers into inactive dimers. The results from Fig. 1 suggest that the N-terminal end of MutS is important for heteroduplex DNA binding. This is in agreement with the observation of Malkov et al. (17Malkov V.A. Biswas I. Camerini-Otero R.D. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23811-23817Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that Phe-39 of the Thermus aquaticus (Phe-36 in E. coli) MutS cross-links to mismatched DNA. We also find, however, that specific DNA binding occurs at a low level in the mutant deleted for residues 26–260 but is not detectable if residues 261–556 are deleted (Fig. 2). InThermus thermophilus, a proteolytic fragment containing residues 275–570 of MutS is able to bind double-stranded DNA (18Tachiki H. Kato R. Masui R. Hasegawa K. Itakura H. Fukuyama K. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4153-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), confirming the importance of this region for DNA binding. The ability of MutS to dimerize appears to reside within the region containing residues 557–853 (Fig. 3). This agrees with the finding by Alani (19Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that in yeast the C-terminal 114 amino acids of Msh2 are important for interaction with Msh6. Taken together these findings suggest that the same region of MutS homologs is used for homo- and heterodimerization. Alani et al. (15Alani E. Sokolsky T. Studamire B. Miret J.J. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2436-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have also described a mutation (A859E) in yeast Msh2 located in the putative helix-turn-helix domain, which affected Msh2-Msh6 heterodimer formation. The equivalent residue in E. coli MutS is Ala-776 that is within the predicted interaction region (residues 557–853). Because none of the mutations we tested were completely defective in dimerization, it is highly probable that additional residues are involved. The C-terminal region of MutS also seems to be important for MutS-MutL interaction, and the results in Fig. 4 are the only available mutational data addressing this question. Given that MutS-MutL interaction was detected in the presence of MutS, but not in its absence, and that the extent of the interaction could be varied by mutation (Fig. 4), we believe the assay detected bonafide interaction. However, given the high NaCl concentration (500 mm) used in these experiments, it is probable that the MutS-MutL complexes detected in these experiments are not bound to heteroduplex DNA. This suggests that a fraction of the total MutS protein in vivo may be loosely bound to MutL in the absence of DNA. Even when MutS is bound to DNA in vitro, its interaction with MutL is not readily detectable (20Drotschmann K. Aronshtam A. Fritz H.J. Marinus M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This might explain why the MutS-MutL complexes are detected in column eluates only at low concentrations of imidazole (Fig. 4). None of the mutant proteins tested was totally deficient in MutS-MutL interaction, suggesting that amino acids 556–630, which include the P-loop motif, are required. The methods we have used for protein interaction do not allow a quantitative measurement of the interaction affinities. We have, therefore, used a qualitative scale to express the results (Fig.1). The MutS family of proteins from prokaryotes and eukaryotes is highly conserved (3Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 4Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 5Umar A. Kunkel T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21Eisen J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4291-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The results we have obtained with the E. coli MutS protein should be applicable to other members of the family. It should now be possible to target individual amino acid residues in the regions we have identified in MutS or its homologues to further define those important for DNA binding, dimerization, and MutL interaction.

Thus, 20 S proteasomes interact with the 3′-untranslated region of certain cytoplasmic mRNAs in vivo, and 20 S proteasomes isolated from Friend leukemia virus-infected mouse spleen cells were found to be associated with a mRNA fragment showing great homology to the 3′-untranslated region of tumor necrosis factor-β mRNA that contains AUUUA sequences. We furthermore demonstrate that 20 S proteasomes destabilize oligoribonucleotides corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of tumor necrosis factor-α, creating a specific cleavage pattern. The cleavage reaction is accelerated with increasing number of AUUUA motifs, and major cleavage sites are localized at the 5′ side of the A residues.

It is currently evident that the proteasome plays a key role in multiple events. Thus, it is involved in the regulation of transcription, antigen presentation, and the degradation of damaged and misfolded proteins, and it drives the cell cycle (1Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence for the involvement of the proteasome in post-transcriptional control of gene expression (2Pouch M.N. Petit F. Buri J. Briand Y. Schmid H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22023-22028Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,3Petit F. Jarrousse A.S. Boissonnet G. Dadet M.H. Buri J. Briand Y. Schmid H.P. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1997; 24: 113-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome is a highly organized multimeric protein complex forming a cylindrical structure that has been detected in all eukaryotic cell systems investigated so far as well as in bacteria (1Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). The proteasome cylinder consists of a stack of two α discs and two central β rings, each of which is composed of seven subunits with molecular masses between 19 and 35 kDa. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed up to 20 individual proteins with the number varying between cells and species. The β rings of the 20 S proteasome harbor at least five endopeptidase activities that are differently regulated in an ATP-dependent fashion by two copies of a 19 S protein complex, which can associate with the α discs of the 20 S core proteasome, forming the 26 S proteasome with a molecular mass of about 2000 kDa. This complex processes and degrades ubiquitinated proteins (1Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). In addition, proteasomes have been reported to contain about 0.0016–0.2% low molecular mass RNAs. The RNA content depends on the origin of the proteasomes and decreases with increasing proteasome purity (4Pamnani V. Haass B. Pühler G. Sanger H.L. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 225: 511-519Google Scholar, 5Schmid H.P. Akhayat O. Martins de Sa C. Puvion F. Köhler K. Scherrer K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These RNAs are heterogeneous in size but migrate most frequently in a molecular size range of 70–200 nucleotides (5Schmid H.P. Akhayat O. Martins de Sa C. Puvion F. Köhler K. Scherrer K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Partial sequence analysis of proteasomal RNAs has revealed that no particular species of RNA is specifically associated with the proteasomes. These proteasomal RNAs were suggested to represent contaminations of purified proteasomes (4Pamnani V. Haass B. Pühler G. Sanger H.L. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 225: 511-519Google Scholar) or residual substrate fragments of a specific proteasomal RNase activity (2Pouch M.N. Petit F. Buri J. Briand Y. Schmid H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22023-22028Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The latter hypothesis is more attractive because it has been shown that endonuclease activity is associated with subunits ζ and ι in the α discs of proteasomes, indicating the existence of a close and specific relationship between proteasomes and RNA (6Petit F. Jarrousse A.S. Dahlmann B. Sobek A. Hendil K.B. Buri J. Briand Y. Schmid H.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this context, 20 S proteasomes (prosomes) were detected as factors that control translation of Friend leukemia virus-infected mouse erythroblasts by transient association with free mRNAs (5Schmid H.P. Akhayat O. Martins de Sa C. Puvion F. Köhler K. Scherrer K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 7Martins de Sa C. Grossi de Sa M.F. Akhayat O. Broders F. Scherrer K. Horsch A. Schmid H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 479-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). How proteasomes select senescent free mRNAs for degradation remains unknown. Work on mRNA decay has shown that sequence elements such as the 3′-untranslated region (UTR)1regulate the degradation of different eukaryotic messengers. The best studied are the AUUUA-rich motifs within the 3′-UTR of short-lived mRNAs named ARE. The mechanisms by which these mRNAs are targeted for rapid degradation and the factors that are involved in this association with ARE have not been definitively characterized (8Chen C.Y.A. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we provide evidence in vivo andin vitro that 20 S proteasomes associate with 3′-UTR mRNA fragments containing AUUUA motifs. In addition, we first demonstrate that AUUUA-rich elements are degraded by 20 S proteasome-associated RNase activity at specific cleavage sites. Buffer TBK X consists of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, x mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 7 mm2-mercaptoethanol, where x is 100, 240, or 350. 20 S proteasomes were extracted from Friend leukemia virus-infected mouse spleen or calf liver by differential centrifugations (9Tomek W. Buri J. Vallon R. Schmid H.P. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 521: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and highly purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) as described previously (2Pouch M.N. Petit F. Buri J. Briand Y. Schmid H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22023-22028Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration) or 2 volumes of ethanol. Electrophoresis of proteins was on one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gels (according to Ref. 10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206514) Google Scholar). Molecular mass markers were: phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 kDa), and lactalbumin (14 kDa). Proteasomes from sucrose gradient fractions were precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol and sedimented by centrifugation in a HB-4 rotor Sorvall (20 min, 9000 rpm, 4 °C). Pellets were resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and 0.5% sodium lauroylsarkosinat). Then 0.2 mg/ml of proteinase K was added, and incubation was carried out for 1.5 h at 37 °C. RNA was extracted from this suspension with chloroform/phenol (11Perry R.P. La Torre J. Kelley D.E. Greenberg J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 262: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and precipitated with 2.5 volumes ethanol and 0.3 m sodium acetate. Such purified RNA was labeled at the 3′ end with cytidine 3′-5′-[5′-32P]biphosphate in a reaction catalyzed by T4 RNA ligase (12Peattie D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Labeled proteasome RNA was separated on a 11% sequencing gel as described previously (5Schmid H.P. Akhayat O. Martins de Sa C. Puvion F. Köhler K. Scherrer K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The quantity of proteasomes was determined by the Bio-Rad assay. The synthetic oligomers were purchased from Eurogentec (Belgium). RNA oligomers were labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-35S]ATP (Amersham) or [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then incubated with 50 μg of proteasomes for 30 min at 37 °C in TBK 240. The digests were extracted from enzymatic assays with chloroform/phenol (11Perry R.P. La Torre J. Kelley D.E. Greenberg J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 262: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and run on a 16% sequencing gel with 1× TBE running buffer for 2 h at 50 watts. The ladder was obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of RNA oligomers (13Wennborg A. Sohlberg B. Angerer D. Klein G. Von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Identification of poly(A)+ sequences in mRNAs was by hybridization with [3H]poly(U) as described (14Lee G.T.Y. Engelhardt D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This procedure was described in detail (15.Gaedigk, R., Cloning and Characterization of Low Molecular Mass RNA Species from Cytoplasmic 19 S Particles of Mouse Erythroblasts.Ph.D. Thesis, 1988, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany.Google Scholar). 2F. Petit, A.-S. Jarrousse, C. Kreutzer-Schmid, R. Gaedigk, and H.-P. Schmid, unpublished results. Briefly, proteasomes RNA were extracted from proteasomes as described above and polyadenylated (16Sippel A.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 37: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). cDNAs were synthesized using oligo(dT) primers as described (17Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar). After synthesis of the DNA double strand and ligation with a BglII linker, the proteasome DNA was inserted in a pGEM I plasmid and transformed into Escherichia coli DH1 strain (18Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8142) Google Scholar). Finally, the plasmid was isolated and submitted to restriction endonuclease analysis (19Ish-Horowicz D. Burke J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 2989-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was sequenced using the dideoxy procedure (20Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). When a post-mitochondrial supernatant of mouse erythroblasts was analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation, proteasomes probed with a monoclonal antibody sedimented exclusively in subribosomal fractions smaller than the ribosomal subunits 40 S (Fig.1). In this sedimentation range, proteasomes comigrated with a relative heterogeneous population of poly(A)+ mRNAs, which was detected by [3H]poly(U) hybridization (Fig. 1). As previously reported (21Schmid H.P. Köhler K. Setyono B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), these mRNAs are not engaged in translation and consist of a pool of senescent mRNAs and of mRNAs that are stored for future translation. If proteasomes are involved in the degradation of senescent mRNAs containing AREs, they should interact with their 3′-UTR near the poly(A)+ tail. Moreover, if the proteasome 20 S complex that is bound to 3′-UTR partially overlaps with the poly(A)+ sequence, incubation with RNase A and RNase T1 should release proteasome/UTR/poly(A)+ complexes because poly(A)+ is not hydrolyzed under these conditions. To investigate this idea more closely, the particles between 10 and 30 S were pooled and analyzed by further centrifugation on 10–50% sucrose gradients in Tris buffer containing 100 mm KCl (TBK 100). These particles sedimented with two major maxima of absorbance in the range of 13 S, a protein complex of unknown function we and others observed earlier (5Schmid H.P. Akhayat O. Martins de Sa C. Puvion F. Köhler K. Scherrer K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 22Civelli O.C. Vincent A. Maundrell K. Buri J.F. Scherrer K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 108: 577-582Google Scholar), and 20 S, consisting mainly of proteasomes, and one smaller in the range of about 30 S (Fig.2 A). Poly(A)+mRNAs sedimented between 10 and 30 S with major distribution in zones corresponding to the maxima of absorbance (Fig. 2 A). The presence of proteasomes was identified by their typical protein pattern (right panels of Fig. 2).Figure 2Sedimentation profile of subribosomal particles after RNase treatment. Particles of 12 gradients sedimenting between 30 and 10 S (Fig. 1, fractions 10–18) were pooled and concentrated by sedimentation (Beckmann rotor Ti60, 50,000 rpm, 4 °C, 19 h).

D, schematic presentation of the RNase protection experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) After incubation with RNase T1 and RNase A, [3H]poly(U) hybridization revealed a sharp peak of labeled poly(A)+containing particles in the range of 10 S (23Schönfelder M. Horsch A. Schmid H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6884-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and a smaller population that sedimented in the range of 20 S, together with proteasomes (Fig. 2 B). However, when Rnase-treated particles were analyzed by centrifugation through sucrose gradients containing TBK 350, much less poly(A)+ containing fragments sedimented with 20 S proteasomes (Fig. 2 C). From these experiments, we concluded that proteasomes retained poly(A)+ containing mRNA fragments at 100 mm KCl, while they dissociated from the proteasome complex at 350 mm KCl. This is in good agreement with results we have published earlier showing that proteasomes dissociate completely from mRNAs at 350 mmKCl (Refs. 5Schmid H.P. Akhayat O. Martins de Sa C. Puvion F. Köhler K. Scherrer K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar and 7Martins de Sa C. Grossi de Sa M.F. Akhayat O. Broders F. Scherrer K. Horsch A. Schmid H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 479-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar and Fig.3 A). These observations suggest that proteasomes interact directly with the poly(A)+sequence or very nearby in the 3′-UTR of certain mRNAs. Another strong argument for a possible association of proteasomes with mRNAs is the presence of different smaller RNA molecules in proteasomes preparations. The length of these RNAs and the RNA content varies from preparation to preparation. Based on these findings, we postulated recently that at least some of these RNA molecules could be residual fragments of the RNA substrates cleaved by the endonuclease activity that is associated with proteasomes (2Pouch M.N. Petit F. Buri J. Briand Y. Schmid H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22023-22028Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 3Petit F. Jarrousse A.S. Boissonnet G. Dadet M.H. Buri J. Briand Y. Schmid H.P.

J. 1997; 326: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To elucidate this hypothesis, we sequenced some proteasome-associated RNAs. For this approach, 10–30 S particles (Fig. 1) were pooled and further sedimented through 10–50% sucrose gradients in TBK 350. Under these conditions, poly(A)+ mRNAs dissociated completely from 20 S proteasomes (Fig. 3 A). Such purified proteasomes were pooled (Fig. 3 A, fractions 12 and13), and the purity of the particles was tested by Laemmli polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fig. 3 B shows the typical pattern of proteasomal subunits migrating between 20 and 35 kDa with some faint bands of nonproteasomal proteins in the range of 43–68 kDa. Proteasome-associated RNAs were extracted from these fractions, labeled at the 3′ end with cytidine 3′-5′-[5′-32P]biphosphate, and analyzed by RNA gel electrophoresis. Fig. 3 C shows typical profiles of proteasome-associated RNAs, which migrate as a heterogeneous population ranging from 60 to 500 nucleotides. Highly purified proteasomes washed with 1% lauroylsarkosyl contain almost one RNA species, which was identified to be tRNALys3 (3Petit F. Jarrousse A.S. Boissonnet G. Dadet M.H. Buri J. Briand Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 20: 1959-1965Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For sequencing, RNAs were extracted from less purified 20 S fractions. After polyadenylation, cDNAs of proteasome-associated RNAs were synthesized and cloned in a pGEM I transcription vector. Sequencing of eight cDNA clones using dideoxynucleotides revealed quite different sequences (15.Gaedigk, R., Cloning and Characterization of Low Molecular Mass RNA Species from Cytoplasmic 19 S Particles of Mouse Erythroblasts.Ph.D. Thesis, 1988, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany.Google Scholar).2 We here show sequence number 4 (P4), which contains several AUUUA motifs (Fig.4 A). Further computer analysis revealed that this sequence is 86% homologous with the 3′-UTR of mouse TNFβ mRNA (Fig. 4 B). Several cellular proteins acting as trans-factors were reported to recognize AREs and may target, in some way, cytokine mRNAs like TNFα mRNA for degradation. Among these factors that associate specifically with ARE, a 20 S protein complex with unknown protein composition was described to be involved in the destabilization of ARE (26Savant-Bhonsale S. Cleveland D.W. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1927-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Because 20 S proteasomes and this 20 S protein complex share common properties and because we have identified an RNA fragment containing AUUUA motifs almost homologous to TNF mRNA in proteasome preparations, we wanted to investigate whether proteasomes could be involved in the degradation of ARE. In a first series of experiments, we incubated highly purified proteasomes with [γ-35S]ATP-labeled 3′-UTR of murine mRNA TNFα that contains an extended adenosine- and uridine-rich region. After extraction with chloroform/phenol, the digests were run on a 16% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Fig.5 A demonstrates that proteasomes cleaved the TNFα 3′-UTR in seven well defined fragments. Comparison of the adenosine- and uridine-rich sequences of many cytokine mRNAs including those that code for TNFα led to the identification of sequence motifs like AUUUA that are often present in multiple copies. The TNFα 3′-UTR we used for our experiments contained five copies of this pentameric motif, four of which overlap (AUUUAUUUA) (Fig. 5 B). So we asked whether the number of AUUUA motifs could modify the cleavage reaction. To address this question, different synthetic oligoribonucleotides containing no, two, or four copies of the AUUUA motif were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and used in degradation assays. We found that a minimum of two AUUUA motifs is required for the destabilization by proteasomes. We detected only one cleavage site with (AUUUA)2 oligo-RNA, whereas incubation of (AUUUA)4 oligo-RNA with proteasomes produced five fragments corresponding to five cleavage sites (Fig.6). Obviously, preferential cleavage sites are situated at the 5′ end of the nucleotide A within a AUUUA motif. Moreover, the densitometric analysis of native oligonucleotides containing two or four motifs after incubation with proteasomes for various times revealed that (AUUUA)4 oligo-RNA was degraded much faster than the oligo-RNA containing two AUUUA motifs (data not shown). These data correlate well with in vivo experiments (27Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3112) Google Scholar). Despite the identification of several proteins that associate with RNAs containing AUUUA motifs in vitro, none has been definitively linked to ARE-mediated degradation of mRNAs. Most of these proteins migrated on polyacrylamide gels in a range of 30–45 kDa. First identified was a protein with a molecular mass of 44 kDa containing three subunits and named AUBF (adenosine-uridine bindingfactor (28Malter J.S. Science. 1989; 246: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro destabilizing system, Brewer (29Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) identified two polypeptides of 37 and 40 kDa that are implicated in the acceleration of degradation of ARE containing messengers. Others described a 32-kDa protein identical to HuR that specifically cross-links to (AUUUA)4 and (AUUUUA)3 but not (AUA)8 and (AUUA)5 RNAs in vitro (30Myer V.E. Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2130-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This protein would play an RNA-stabilizing role in the ARE-directed mRNA decay in mammalian cells (31Peng S.S. Chen C.Y.A. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a cytoplasmic 20 S protein complex with unknown protein composition was described to be involved in the destabilization of AREs (26Savant-Bhonsale S. Cleveland D.W. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1927-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This work was of particular interest because we have recently shown that a similar cytoplasmic structure, the 20 S proteasome, harbors a specific endonuclease activity (2Pouch M.N. Petit F. Buri J. Briand Y. Schmid H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22023-22028Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, the results in this paper clearly demonstrate that proteasomes hydrolyze oligo-RNAs with (AUUUA)-rich multimers at specific sitesin vitro, which corresponds well with the in vivoobservations of other groups. Cellular mRNAs with ARE in their 3′-UTR are expressed transiently with half-lives in the order of 10–30 min (32Raj N.B. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3923-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas β-globin mRNA that contains only one AUUUA motif is very stable with a half-life greater than 17 h (33Aviv H. Voloch Z. Bastos R. Levy S. Cell. 1976; 8: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that deletion or replacement of the adenosine- and uridine-rich sequence in the 3′-UTR of c-fosmRNA conferred significantly greater stability to the previously unstable messenger (34Wilson T. Treisman R. Nature. 1988; 336: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), whereas the addition of a short DNA sequence from the granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor 3′-UTR into the 3′-UTR of the rabbit β-globin gene destabilized the corresponding naturally stable β-globin mRNA (27Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3112) Google Scholar). This could explain why globin mRNA with one AUUUA motif was not degraded by proteasome-associated endonuclease activity (2Pouch M.N. Petit F. Buri J. Briand Y. Schmid H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22023-22028Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For accelerated degradation, proteasomes apparently require multiple AUUUA motifs (at least two) that partially overlap. Based on these results, we concluded that proteasomes could be involved in the degradation of ARE. This conclusion correlates well with the following observations: (i) purified proteasomes from Friend leukemia virus-infected mouse spleen cells contain adenosine- and uridine-rich RNA fragments with great homology to the 3′-UTR of TNFβ mRNA (Fig. 4); (ii) Arrigoet al. (35Arrigo A.P. Darlix J.L. Khandjian E.W. Simon M. Spahr P.F. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have demonstrated by RNA sequencing thatDrosophila proteasomes are associated with RNA fragments that possess extended adenosine- and uridine-rich elements; and (iii) finally, our RNase protection experiments confirmed that proteasomes interact specifically with the 3′ end of a nondefined number of cytoplasmic RNAs. However, the binding site is not the poly(A)+sequence because proteasome-associated RNA fragments reported so far do not have oligo(A) stretches, and proteasomes associate strongly with TMV-RNA without poly(A)+ or with adenovirus mRNAs of which the poly(A)+ tail is blocked by oligo(dT) (36Horsch A. Martins de Sa C. Dineva B. Spindler E. Schmid H.P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We suspect that proteasomes bind to sequences adjacent or within adenosine- and uridine-rich elements close to poly(A)+ and cleave the 3′ end with the poly(A)+ sequences of the corresponding messengers. This idea fits well with the hypothesis of other groups that postulate the existence of a specific cytoplasmic endonuclease activity to be involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing (26Savant-Bhonsale S. Cleveland D.W. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1927-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The results suggest that proteasomes could inhibit the translation of certain cytokine mRNAs and in general of other short-lived mRNAs using their ARE as target for degradation. Inappropriate translation of these cellular mRNAs has dramatic effects because their protein products interfere with cell division and cell differentiation. Interestingly, viral mRNAs like tobacco mosaic virus RNA with much less extended adenosine- and uridine-rich motifs was reported to be a good substrate for proteasome-associated RNase activity (2Pouch M.N. Petit F. Buri J. Briand Y. Schmid H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22023-22028Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, selective recognition of proteasomes RNA substrate and the association of proteasomes with RNA sequences cannot be restricted to the presence of adenosine- and uridine-rich elements alone. In fact, RNAs of different origin like tRNALys3, viral RNAs, or 18 S rRNA that associate with proteasomes suggest the existence of a common secondary structure or box-like sequence. Indeed preliminary sequence comparison of these mRNAs and RNA fragments we found in proteasomes preparations revealed a common nucleotide motif that will be presented in a subsequent paper. Taken together, we concluded that the endonuclease activity associated with the α subunits ζ and ι of the 20 S proteasome complex (6Petit F. Jarrousse A.S. Dahlmann B. Sobek A. Hendil K.B. Buri J. Briand Y. Schmid H.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) is rather important for cellular events. We thank Dr. R. John Mayer for helpful discussions."

When the intracellular Ca2+ concentration increases upon stimulation of cells by Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane or through Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores, Ca2+ binds to calmodulin. Ca2+/calmodulin binds to the calmodulin-binding sequence of the kinase, resulting in displacement of the autoinhibitory segment and exposure of the catalytic site for RLC phosphorylation (12Kemp B.E.

These binding affinities were decreased in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin (18Sellers J.R. Pato M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7740-7746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, Ca2+/calmodulin may interact with an N-terminal F-actin-binding site of myosin light chain kinase, distinct from the calmodulin-binding sequence at the C terminus of the catalytic core (15Ye L.H. Hayakawa K. Kishi H. Imamura M. Nakamura A. Okagaki T. Takagi T. Iwata A. Tanaka T. Kohama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32182-32189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The F-actin binding site in residues 1–41 had aK a value of approximately 105m−1 with an IQ-like sequence in residues 26–41 that bound calmodulin (15Ye L.H. Hayakawa K. Kishi H. Imamura M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32182-32189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Studies have also shown that myosin light chain kinase binds to cellular actomyosin-containing filaments. Immunocytochemistry studies found myosin light chain kinase localized to actomyosin-containing stress fibers or myofilaments in nonmuscle and smooth muscle cells, respectively (19de Lanerolle P. Adelstein R.S. Feramisco J.R. Burridge K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4738-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Guerriero Jr., V. Rowley D.R. Means A.R. Cell. 1981; 27: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recent investigations in vitro andin vivo showed that the N-terminal half of the kinase (residues 1–655), not the C terminus, was both necessary and sufficient for binding to isolated smooth muscle myofilaments, stress fibers in permeabilized fibroblasts, and myofilaments in intact smooth muscle cells (21Lin P. Luby-Phelps K. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, the apparent binding affinities of myosin light chain kinase to smooth muscle myofilaments and actin-containing thin filaments were greater than to purified smooth muscle F-actin and skeletal muscle myofilaments (21Lin P. Luby-Phelps K. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Stull J.T. Lin P. Krueger J.K. Trewhella J. Zhi G. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, myosin light chain kinase binds to actomyosin-containing filaments or actin-containing thin filaments in cells with an affinity greater than to F-actin alone, perhaps due to the presence of a distinct anchoring protein or a protein that facilitates binding to F-actin.Other reports support the idea that myosin light chain kinase binds tightly to actomyosin-containing filaments in cells or tissues. For example, smooth muscle tissue strips made permeable with 1% Triton X-100 and stored for several weeks at −20 °C in 50% glycerol were still able to contract in the presence of Mg2+ATP and Ca2+/calmodulin (23Tansey M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9912-9920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation of myosin light chain kinase showed no significant loss of the kinase after storage. Thus, myosin light chain kinase appears to bind tightly to myofilaments in permeable smooth muscle cells with an apparent affinity greater than values reported for binding to purified F-actin (21Lin P. Luby-Phelps K. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether myosin light chain kinase must dissociate from actin-containing thin filaments to phosphorylate myosin RLC in the thick filaments (14Kanoh S. Ito M. Niwa E. Kawano Y. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8902-8907Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Ye L.H. Hayakawa K. Kishi H. Imamura M. Nakamura A. Okagaki T. Takagi T. Iwata A. Tanaka T.

Stimulation of smooth muscle tissues can result in a high extent (50–100%) of RLC phosphorylation, particularly in the presence of a cell-permeable protein phosphatase inhibitor (24Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Science. 1986; 232: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Colburn J.C. Michnoff C.H. Hsu L.C. Slaughter C.A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Yet, the concentration of RLC in smooth muscle is estimated as 75–80 mm, a concentration 25 times greater than the concentration of myosin light chain kinase (28Cohen D.M. Murphy R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1978; 72: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Ikebe M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1989; 255: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase associated with actin-containing filaments may thus dissociate and diffuse to myosin-containing filaments to achieve a high extent of RLC phosphorylation during contraction (14Kanoh S. Ito M. Niwa E. Kawano Y. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8902-8907Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+/calmodulin may not only activate the kinase but also dissociate it from actin-containing filaments via interaction with a second binding site in the N terminus (15Ye L.H. Hayakawa K.

To test this hypothesis, we transiently expressed myosin light chain kinase with green fluorescent protein and established a system to study its binding to stress fibers in permeable A7r5 cells derived from smooth muscle.DISCUSSIONPrevious investigations showed that myosin light chain kinase bound to F-actin and F-actin-containing filaments in cells (14Kanoh S.

Although it was assumed the binding in cells was to F-actin, a recent report indicated a significant difference in apparent affinities for the two types of filaments (21Lin P. Luby-Phelps K.

This observation was extended herein with fluorescence imaging of Cy3-labeled kinase binding to purified F-actin or gizzard myofilaments. Myosin light chain kinase bound to gizzard myofilaments with no significant binding to F-actin. These results are consistent with high affinity binding of the kinase to myofilaments, perhaps due to an anchoring or accessory protein. They also raise a question as to whether this binding is regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin like the low affinity binding of kinase to purified F-actin.A fusion protein containing myosin light chain kinase and GFP (MLCK-GFP) was expressed to monitor kinase binding to actin-containing filaments in cells. It has similar catalytic and binding properties as purified smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase and therefore may be used to characterize binding of myosin light chain kinase to actin-containing stress fibers in cells. FL MLCK-GFP, although primarily localized to the filaments in intact cells, showed some diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence that depended on the extent of expression. This cytoplasmic fluorescence may be due to saturation of kinase binding sites on stress fibers in A7r5 cells, which is supported by the observations that it diffused out when cells were treated with saponin. Smooth muscle cells in tissues have a greater capacity for binding myosin light chain kinase, because previous reports showed that the kinase bound completely to skinned fibers (23Tansey M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9912-9920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or detergent-washed myofilaments (36Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7501-7509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FL MLCK-GFP on actin-containing filaments remains bound after saponin permeabilization. These results obtained from MLCK-GFP-transfected A7r5 cells are similar to those in Triton X-100-permeable fibroblasts and intact smooth muscle cells perfused or microinjected with Cy3-labeled myosin light chain kinases (herein, and see Ref. 21Lin P. Luby-Phelps K. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Binding of myosin light chain kinase to actin-containing filaments in permeable cells is not affected by Ca2+/calmodulin based on the comparison of fluorescence intensities in the presence or absence of Ca2+/calmodulin. In addition, FRAP measurements in permeable cells indicate that myosin light chain kinase does not diffuse laterally along the filaments. Previous studies in vitro showed the binding affinity of myosin light chain kinase for purified F-actin or purified myosin was decreased in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin (15Ye L.H. Hayakawa K. Kishi H. Imamura M. Nakamura A. Okagaki T. Takagi T. Iwata A. Tanaka T. Kohama K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1984; 259: 7740-7746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, Ca2+/calmodulin also decreased the binding affinity of the N-terminal fragment (1–114 residues) of the kinase for purified F-actin and another potential Ca2+/calmodulin binding site was localized within the N-terminal actin binding sequence (residues 26–41) (15Ye L.H. Hayakawa K. Kishi H. Imamura M. Nakamura A. Okagaki T. Takagi T. Iwata A. Tanaka T. Kohama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32182-32189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the binding affinities (105 to 106m−1) of myosin light chain kinase and its actin binding sequence for F-actin alone are low (14Kanoh S. Ito M. Niwa E. Kawano Y. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8902-8907Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,15Ye L.H. Hayakawa K. Kishi H. Imamura M. Nakamura A. Okagaki T. Takagi T. Iwata A. Tanaka T. Kohama K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1981; 256: 7501-7509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from smooth muscles. Deletion of the N-terminal 142 residues of MLCK-GFP prevents binding to actin-containing filaments in cells consistent with previous results (21Lin P. Luby-Phelps K. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) when the N-terminal half of myosin light chain kinase was deleted. These results indicate that a recently identified Ca2+/calmodulin-insensitive binding site in myosin light chain kinase (residues 319–721 preceding the catalytic core; Ref. 15Ye L.H. Hayakawa K. Kishi H. Imamura M. Nakamura A. Okagaki T. Takagi T. Iwata A. Tanaka T. Kohama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32182-32189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) is not responsible for binding to filaments in cells. These results also show that the anchoring motif is in the N terminus of myosin light chain kinase. Importantly, this high affinity binding of myosin light chain kinase to actin-containing filaments in saponin-permeable A7r5 cells and in Triton X-100-permeable Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts was not affected by Ca2+/calmodulin. Although Ca2+/calmodulin is required for activation of catalysis, it does not significantly dissociate myosin light chain kinase from cellular filaments.Filament-bound myosin light chain kinase in saponin-permeabilized cells is sufficient for RLC phosphorylation and cell contraction in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin. Wortmannin and a competitive peptide substrate inhibited Ca2+-dependent RLC phosphorylation and smooth muscle cell contraction in saponin-permeable cells. Previous studies have shown that wortmannin is a potent and selective inhibitor for myosin light chain kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which is involved in formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and Ca2+ signaling (37Nakanishi S. Kakita S. Takahashi I. Kawahara K. Tsukuda E. Sano T. Yamada K. Yoshida M. Kase H. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2157-2163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Powis G.

However, in experiments reported here, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is not an important consideration, since this kinase does not phosphorylate myosin RLC, and a permeable cell system was used so that filament-bound myosin light chain kinase could be activated directly by the addition of Ca2+ and calmodulin. Wortmannin has little or no effect on the activities of other kinases including protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, tyrosine kinases, and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (37Nakanishi S.

In saponin-permeabilized cells, both wortmannin and RLC peptide inhibited Ca2+-dependent RLC phosphorylation and cell contraction, which is consistent with the idea that these coupled events (3Holzapfel G. Wehland J. Weber K. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 148: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 4Kolodney M.S. Elson E.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) are due to filament-bound myosin light chain kinase.In our studies, three forms (non-, mono-, and diphosphorylated) of RLC were observed in saponin-permeable cells in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin and/or okadaic acid. Phosphorylation at Ser-19 of smooth muscle myosin RLC by myosin light chain kinase has been identified both in vitro and in smooth muscle tissues as the major monophosphorylation site important for actin-activated MgATPase activity and myosin motility (25Colburn J.C. Michnoff C.H. Hsu L.C. Slaughter C.A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19166-19173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Pearson R.B. Misconi L.Y. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 25-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Thr-18 is also phosphorylated but at a slower rate by myosin light chain kinasein vitro, leading to diphosphorylated RLC (40Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10027-10031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 36-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contracting smooth muscle tissues, monophosphorylated and diphosphorylated forms of myosin RLC were also observed (34Persechini A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6293-6299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because phosphorylation at Thr-18 has no effect on the velocity of myosin movement in motility assays in vitro (42Umemoto S. Bengur A.R. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1431-1436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the physiological importance of diphosphorylated RLC needs clarification by further investigations.An interesting result was observed in saponin-permeable cells in Ca2+-free buffer. RLC phosphorylation was increased in Ca2+-free buffer containing okadaic acid, a known phosphatase type 1 and 2A inhibitor (26Obara K. Takai A. Ruegg J.C. de Lanerolle P. Pflugers Archiv. 1989; 414: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, wortmannin did not inhibit this RLC phosphorylation. These results suggest that some low kinase activity toward RLC is independent of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase pathway. Ca2+-independent RLC phosphorylation in the presence of a protein phosphatase inhibitor such as okadaic acid has also been reported for smooth muscle tissues (26Obara K. Takai A. Ruegg J.C. de Lanerolle P. Pflugers Archiv. 1989; 414: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recent studies also showed in vitro and in vivo that protein kinase C and Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase) may phosphorylate RLC (43Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9569-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Bengur A.R. Robinson E.A. Appella E. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12257-12260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Although protein kinase C phosphorylated Thr-9, Ser-1, and/or Ser-2 of myosin RLC in vitro, it did not increase actin-activated Mg2+ATPase activity or myosin motility (42Umemoto S. Bengur A.R. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1431-1436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Bengur A.R. Robinson E.A. Appella E. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7613-7617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Smooth muscle contraction still occurred at low Ca2+concentrations, suggesting that a Ca2+-independent isoform of protein kinase Cε could conceivably phosphorylate RLC (46Walsh M.P. Horowitz A. Clement-Chomienne O. Andrea J.E. Allen B.G. Morgan K.G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Rho-kinase activated by GTP-bound RhoA may increase the extent of RLC phosphorylation and induce smooth muscle contraction in the absence of Ca2+ (45Kureishi Y. Kobayashi S. Amano M. Kimura K. Kanaide H. Nakano T. Kaibuchi K. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12257-12260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Increasing RLC phosphorylation by Rho-kinase appears to be primarily indirect through the inactivation of myosin phosphatase by phosphorylation of the myosin-binding subunit of the phosphatase (47Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). However, very little Rho-kinase was present in Triton X-100-permeable fibers (45Kureishi Y. Kobayashi S. Amano M. Kimura K. Kanaide H. Nakano T. Kaibuchi K. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12257-12260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), and both inactive and active Rho-kinases did not appear to be localized to actomyosin-containing fibers based on immunofluorescence staining (48Matsui T.

McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). Further, the number of geranylgeranylated proteins has been shown to be larger than that of farnesylated proteins (11Rilling H.C. Bruenger E. Epstein W.W. Crain P.F.

Recently, these shorter chain prenyl diphosphates also have been shown to be involved in the function of nuclear hormone receptors. Forman et al. (14Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J.

In a study of LXRα, another orphan nuclear receptor, they have also demonstrated that the DNA binding activity of LXRα·RXR complex is inhibited by GGPP (15Forman B.M. Ruan B. Chen J. Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10588-10593Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These reports imply that not only FPP but also GGPP may contribute to signaling pathways in addition to protein prenylation. FPP and GGPP are mevalonate-derived intermediates. The biosynthesis of mevalonate is regulated by a finely tuned mechanism, and the rate-limiting enzyme is 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in animal cells (16Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4478) Google Scholar). FPP, whose carbon chain length is C15, is generally accepted to be the common intermediate occupying the branch point in the biosynthetic pathways to cholesterol, dolichol, ubiquinone, heme a, and farnesylated proteins. This compound is synthesized from dimethylallyl diphosphate by the action of FPP synthase (FPPSase), the most abundant and widely occurring prenyltransferase in mammalian tissues. FPPSase is composed of two identical subunits (17Ding V.D. Sheares B.T. Bergstrom J.D. Ponpipom M.M. Perez L.B. Poulter C.D. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and several FPPSase cDNAs have already been cloned in animals such as chicken, rat, and human (18Chen A. Kroon P.A. Poulter C.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Genomic Southern blot analyses suggested that rat and human have multiple genes encoding divergent FPPSases (19Clarke C.F. Tanaka R.D. Svenson K. Wamsley M. Fogelman A.M. Edwards P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3138-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Sheares B.T. White S.S. Molowa D.T. Chan K. Ding V.D.-H. Kroon P.A. Bostedor R.G. Karkas J.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8129-8135Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GGPP, whose carbon chain length is C20, was initially thought to be supplied from FPP by the action of the FPPSase because FPPSase crystallized from avian liver had a poor but significant ability to synthesize GGPP from FPP and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) (21Reed B.C. Rilling H.C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thereafter, we succeeded in isolating GGPP synthase (GGPPSase) in the different fraction from FPPSase by ion exchange chromatography of pig liver (22Sagami H. Ishii K. Ogura K. Biochem. Int. 1981; 3: 669-675Google Scholar), rat liver (23Sagami H. Korenaga T. Ogura K. Steiger A. Pyun H.-J. Coates R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and bovine brain (24Sagami H. Korenaga T. Ogura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) cytosols. The GGPPSase has been purified from bovine brain in a homogeneous form (25Sagami H. Morita Y. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20561-20566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a one-step procedure by affinity chromatography which contained an FPP analog as a ligand. The purified GGPPSase catalyzed a single reaction C15 → C20 and was composed of four or five subunits of identical size. Considering that GGPP plays a role in the function of a nuclear hormone receptor and of geranylgeranylated proteins, it would be very important to characterize GGPPSase. Our original interest is in characterizing GGPPSase and FPPSase that occur in the same mammal or organ because GGPPSase could be regulated differently from FPPSase for their functions, although both of them catalyze the prenyl(C5)-transferring reaction. It is also interesting to learn the tissue-specific expression of GGPPSase because geranylgeranylated proteins have been reported to be rich specifically in brain (13Epstein W.W. Lever D. Leining L.M. Bruenger E. Rilling H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9668-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the present study, we purified the GGPPSase of bovine brain in large amounts, isolated cDNAs of bovine and human GGPPSases using information from the bovine brain GGPPSase amino acid sequence, expressed the human GGPPSase in Escherichia coli, and characterized it. These analyses revealed that GGPPSase was a considerably different protein from FPPSase. Northern blot analysis indicated the presence of two mRNAs in various tissues.

The crude homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was fractionated with ammonium sulfate.

The active fractions were pooled and then applied directly to a Mono Q column and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl to 0.5 m. The GGPPSase was eluted at 0.15 mNaCl. For purification of FPPSase, the fraction precipitated between 30 and 40% saturation of ammonium sulfate was dialyzed against 10 mm PIPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm MgCl2 and applied to an affinity column with a geranylmethyl phosphonophosphate ligand. The FPPSase was eluted with l mm inorganic diphosphate. The active fractions were purified further by Mono Q chromatography. The standard assay mixture contained, in a final volume of 0.1 ml, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 20 μm [1-14C]IPP, 25 μm GPP or FPP, and an appropriate amount of enzyme fraction. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and terminated by the addition of 0.30 ml of a mixture of concentrated HCl:methanol (4:1) followed by a 15-min incubation at 37 °C. The hexane-soluble hydrolysates were analyzed in a liquid scintillation fluid. For product analysis, the reaction products were extracted with 0.1 ml of 1-butanol saturated with water. The extracts were treated with potato acid phosphatase (2.4 units, 2.2 mg) according to the method of Fujii et al. (28Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 716-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 6 h, the hydrolysates were extracted with hexane and analyzed on a silica gel plate and a reverse phase C18 plate in a solvent system of toluene:ethyl acetate (9:1) and in a solvent system of acetone:water (7:1), respectively. The hydrolysates were also analyzed by the two-plate thin layer chromatography (TLC) method (29Sagami H. Kurisaki A. Ogura K. Chojnacki T. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1857-1861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The positions of authentic standards were visualized with iodine vapor. The radioactivity of polyprenols developed on TLC was determined with a Fuji Bioimage Analyzer BAS 1000. Proteins were analyzed on 10 or 14% polyacrylamide gels (1.0 mm) containing 0.1% SDS and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. FPPSase and GGPPSase were visualized using the specific antibodies and the secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The bovine brain GGPPSase preparation purified by affinity chromatography as described above was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane corresponding to a Ponsau Red-positive GGPPSase band was cut off and analyzed by automated Edman degradation after treatment of lysyl endopeptidase. The sequences obtained were as follows: KAYK (fragment 2), KHLSK (fragment 4), KMFK (fragment 9), KTQETVQRILLEPY (fragment 14), and KQIDARGGNP (fragment 15). The primers used for PCR were commercially synthesized: primer-1 was TCCCATGGAGAAGACTCAA; primer-2, ACTCA(AG)GA(AG)ACAGT(ACGT)CA; primer-3, TT(CT)GT(AG)AA(CT)TC(AG)TT(CT)TACAA; and primer-4, TTACTTATTACAATTCGAAAA. The PCR mixture (50 μl) consisted of 0.5 ng of cDNA, 100 pmol of primers, 0.20 μm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 1.25 units of Ex-Taq DNA polymerase. Thirty-five cycles of amplification (0.5 min at 94 °C for denaturation, 1 min at 50 °C for annealing, and 1 min at 72 °C for extension) were carried out by using a Perkin-Elmer thermalcycler. The amplified products were analyzed on 1.4% agarose electrophoresis and recovered from the gels by use of a Geneclean II kit (BIO 101). The products were ligated directly into a vector pT7 blue T, and the insert DNA sequence was analyzed using the Thermosequenase Cycle Sequence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech US78500). The 919-base pair DNA containing human GGPPSase cDNA was isolated from pT7 blue T vector after double digestion with NcoI and BamHI, and the fragment was ligated into the NcoI and BamHI sites of a bacterial expression vector pTrc 99A. E. coliJM109 cells transformed with the vector alone or with the plasmid containing human GGPPSase cDNA (pTrc-HGG) were grown in 50 ml of LB medium to an A 600 of 0.5. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and after 2.5 h culture the cells were collected and suspended in 2.0 ml of the TE buffer (pH 8.0). The cell suspensions were sonicated with a Branson sonifier before centrifugation at 14,000 × g to remove unbroken cells. The supernatants were frozen in aliquots for protein determination, SDS-PAGE, and GGPPSase assays. In a previous report (25Sagami H. Morita Y. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20561-20566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we described a one-step purification of GGPPSase from bovine brain. The GGPPSase fraction still contained several minor proteins. We tried to improve the purification procedure with a combination of several chromatographies including affinity chromatography. As a result, Butyl-Toyopearl chromatography completely separated GGPPSase from FPPSase and IPP isomerase. This enabled us to prepare the purified GGPPSase with large amounts. Table Ishows the entire purification steps of GGPPSase and FPPSase. The former enzyme (297 μg) and the latter enzyme (725 μg) were purified with specific activities of 294 and 1,070 nmol/min/mg from 6.01 and 10.8 kg of bovine brain, respectively. Fig.1 A shows SDS-PAGE of the purified GGPPSase and FPPSase. The GGPPSase (35.0 kDa) migrated faster than the FPPSase (37.5 kDa), suggesting that the entire polypeptide chain length of GGPPSase is shorter than that of FPPSase unless a post-translationary modification is present. A polyclonal antibody directed against the GGPPSase did not recognize the FPPSase (Fig.1 B), and a polyclonal antibody directed against the FPPSase did not recognize the GGPPSase (Fig. 1 C). The Western blot analysis of crude extracts did not show any positive protein bands with the anti-GGPPSase antibody. Only affinity-purified GGPPSase was recognized by the antibody, suggesting that the GGPPSase content in the brain is low and that the current antibody is either of low affinity or titer.Table IPurification of GGPPSase and FPPSase of bovine brainStepsUnitsProteinSpecific activityYieldPurificationnmol/minmgnmol/min/mg%foldGGPPase40–60% (NH4)2SO43,63024,2000.151001Butyl Toyopearl4122701.5311.410F-affinityaF-affinity, farnesylmethyl phosphonophosphate affinity chromatography.1591.381154.4767Mono Q87.30.2972942.41,960FPPSase30–40% (NH4)2SO42,43015,2000.161001G-affinitybG-affinity, geranylmethyl phosphonophosphate affinity chromatography.6241.8334125.72,130Mono Q7750.7251,07031.96,690GGPPSase and FPPSase were purified starting from 6.01 kg and 10.8 kg of bovine brain, respectively.

GPP and [1–14C]IPP were used as substrates for FPPSase. Edman analysis of the purified bovine brain GGPPSase suggested that the NH2 -terminal amino acid was blocked. Treatment of the enzyme protein with lysyl endopeptidase gave partial amino acid sequences of five fragments (fragments 2, 4, 9, 14, and 15). We searched various cDNAs registered in GenBank and found 22 partial human cDNA fragments as sequence homologs to a Neurospora crassa GGPPSase gene. Based on the sequence homology, we arranged the human cDNA fragments as shown in Fig.2. The amino acid sequences KTQETVQRILLEPY (fragment 14) and KHLSKMFK (fragments 4 and 9) identified in bovine brain GGPPSase were found in the deduced amino acid sequence of these fragments. Based on the partial amino acid sequences of the bovine brain GGPPSase described above, we synthesized nucleotide primers (sense primer-2 and antisense primer-3). PCR with primers-2 and -3 using human testis cDNA (CLONTECH) as a template gave an 875-base product. Sequence analysis revealed that this fragment contained the sequence of the partial human cDNA fragments picked up in Fig. 2. We synthesized sense primer-1 and antisense primer-4 containing a starting codon (ATG) and a stop codon (TAA), respectively. As expected, PCR of human testis cDNA with primers-1 and -4 gave a 919-base product that covered an entire coding sequence of human GGPPSase. On the basis of the similarity of the peptide sequence between NH2 -terminal and COOH-terminal human and bovine GGPPSases, we performed a PCR with a combination of primers-1 and -4 using bovine liver cDNA as a template. Multiple PCR products were obtained in this case. However, further amplification of the multiple PCR products with a combination of the inner primers (primers-2 and -3) gave an 875-base product on an agarose electrophoresis. The deduced amino acid sequence of the 875-base product contained all of the partial sequence (fragments 2, 4, 9, 14, and 15) determined by Edman degradation of purified bovine brain GGPPSase, indicating that the cDNA (875 base pairs) encodes a partial bovine brain GGPPSase. To confirm that the human 919-base PCR product codes GGPPSase, we tried to express the protein and assay the enzyme activity. E. coli JM109 cells were transformed with the expression plasmid pTrc 99A containing the GGPPSase cDNA, and the cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3 A, a polypeptide corresponding to 33 kDa was induced by the addition of IPTG. Western blot analysis showed that this polypeptide was specifically recognized by anti-bovine brain GGPPSase antibody (Fig.3 B). To determine whether the induced protein is active, the bacterial cell extracts were used as the enzyme source in GGPPSase assays. The enzymatic activity with a combination of FPP and [1-14C]IPP was enhanced about 40-fold in the expressed cells compared with the control cells as shown in TableII. The reaction products comigrated not only with the spot of geranylgeranyl monophosphate but also with that of GGPP on normal phase silica gel TLC (not shown). However, the hydrolysates by acid phosphatase treatment of the products moved with the spot of all-trans-geranylgeraniol on reverse phase C18 TLC (Fig. 3 C) and normal phase TLC (not shown). These results indicate that the isolated cDNA codes an active GGPPSase protein. The expressed human GGPPSase protein was purified by Butyl-Toyopearl and Mono Q column chromatographies and by Superdex 200 gel filtration. The enzyme was purified as a single peak with a molecular mass of 280 kDa (Fig. 3 D) on the gel filtration. The purified GGPPSase catalyzed the formation of GGPP, and the allylic substrate specificity for the enzyme is shown in Fig.3 E. Table III shows quantitative analysis of the enzymatic products. These results confirmed the identify of the expected 900-base cDNA as encoding human GGPPSase and the similar properties of human GGPPSase to bovine GGPPSase in the substrate specificity as characterized previously (25Sagami H. Morita Y. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20561-20566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that the human GGPPSase also behaves as an oligomer composed of eight subunits of identical size (33 kDa) similar to bovine brain GGPPSase. Fig.4 A shows the cDNA sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of human testis GGPPSase. The amino acid sequence predicted from the GGPPSase gene corresponds to a polypeptide chain with molecular mass of 34,870 Da. The human GGPPSase only showed 16% sequence identity with the known human FPPSase (Fig.4 B) but 49.2% identity in the consensus sequences (I, II, III, IV, and V) proposed for trans-prenyltransferase. The total homology between the nucleotide sequences was 27.8%. The GGPPSase had three potential N-glycosylation sites.Table IIGGPPSase activity in E. coli extractsPlasmidIPTGFPPSpecific activityRelative specific activitynmol/min/mgpTrc 99A++0.1891.00pTrc-HGG++8.34544.15pTrc-HGG−+0.3401.80pTrc-HGG+−0.0360.19GGPPSase activities were measured in extracts from cells (JM109) transformed with plasmids as indicated. pTrc-HGG shows a plasmid containing human GGPPSase cDNA in the pTrc 99A vector.

Assays were carried out in the presence (+) and absence (−) of FPP. Northern blotting analyses with 32P-labeled cDNA probes encoding the human testis GGPPSase revealed two sizes of mRNAs (about 1.5 and 3.1 kilobases) in various tissues (Fig.5). These mRNAs were abundant in heart, skeletal muscle, and testis, with the shorter mRNA being the major species in these tissues. The amount of GGPPSase mRNA in the brain was lower than expected given the degree of enrichment of geranylgeranylated proteins in this organ (11Rilling H.C. Bruenger E. Epstein W.W. Crain P.F. Science. 1990; 247: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The original aim of our study was to learn how FPPSase and GGPPSase are different from each other because these enzymes catalyze a common isoprenyl-transferring reaction. Polyclonal antibodies directed against the two enzymes of bovine brain did not show any cross-reactivity with each other (Fig. 1). The immunochemical difference between these two proteins was confirmed with amino acid sequence comparison between the GGPPSase determined in this study and the known human FPPSase (30Wilkin D.J. Kutsunai S.Y. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4607-4614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B). Five conserved amino acid motifs (I, II, III, IV, and, V) common totrans-prenyltransferases reported (18Chen A. Kroon P.A. Poulter C.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) were observed between the two enzymes, but the entire identity was only 16%. The human GGPPSase has three potential N-glycosylation sites, whereas human FPPSase has no such sites (30Wilkin D.J. Kutsunai S.Y. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4607-4614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Any potentialN-glycosylation site is also not observed in the amino acid sequences of FPPSase of rat (19Clarke C.F. Tanaka R.D. Svenson K. Wamsley M. Fogelman A.M. Edwards P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3138-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is not clear at present whether the GGPPSase is N-glycosylated. Human GGPPSase shows extremely high homology to other GGPPSases of bovine,Drosophila, and N. crassa (Fig.6). Three potentialN-glycosylation sites observed in human GGPPSase are also found in the bovine enzyme, and two of them are conserved in the insect enzyme, although two Asn-X-Ser/Thr motifs are found at different sites in the N. crassa enzyme. Sheares et al. (20Sheares B.T. White S.S. Molowa D.T. Chan K. Ding V.D.-H. Kroon P.A. Bostedor R.G. Karkas J.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8129-8135Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) reported that the expression of human FPPSase in Hep G2 cells is transcriptionally regulated: lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, increased the level of the mRNA, whereas cholesterol in its 25-hydroxylated form or in low density lipoprotein particles reduced the amount of the mRNA, and mevalonate also decreased the mRNA levels. Similar regulation of HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, and low density lipoprotein receptor had been already reported (16Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4478) Google Scholar), suggesting a common control mechanism for these enzymes. Recently, Guan et al. (31Guan G. Dai P. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12526-12535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) described differential, transcriptional regulation of the human gene encoding squalene synthase, which accepts FPP as a substrate, by variation in the level of cellular cholesterol. Concerning GGPPSase, which also accepts FPP as a substrate, the study on regulation is far behind those of the enzymes described above. Lutz et al.(32Lutz R.J. McLain T.M. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7983-7986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that GGPP synthesis is specifically inhibited by GGPP, suggesting that the cellular GGPP pool may be regulated by product inhibition of GGPPSase. Our in vitro experiments using a purified bovine brain GGPPSase supported this regulation (25Sagami H. Morita Y. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20561-20566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GGPP acts as a precursor for the C20 lipid moiety in prenylated proteins and also as a modulator for nuclear hormone receptor (LXRα·RXR) complex formation. In the present study two mRNAs of GGPPSase were identified. Arrangement of several partial cDNA sequences registered in GenBank (Fig. 2) further implies the presence of more than two GGPPSase mRNAs. Therefore, the GGPP synthesis might be regulated at the transcriptional level of GGPPSase. Rilling et al. (11Rilling H.C. Bruenger E. Epstein W.W. Crain P.F. Science. 1990; 247: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) have reported the content of geranylgeranylated proteins in mouse tissues; these proteins are severalfold rich in brain compared with those in liver, kidney, and lung. In human tissues, two GGPPSase mRNAs were also observed in those tissues. Although they did not describe the content of geranylgeranylated proteins in mouse heart, skeletal muscle, and testis, much higher contents of human GGPPSase mRNAs were detected in these tissues. Two kinds of protein geranylgeranyl transferase responsible for the synthesis geranylgeranylated proteins have been found and characterized in mammals. On Northern blot analysis for rat protein geranylgeranyl transferase II consisting of α and β subunits (component B) and an escort protein (component A) (33Armstrong S.A. Seabra M.C. Südhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12221-12229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A. Smeland T.E. Cremers F.P.M. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1091-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), the α and β subunits mRNAs are abundant in heart and much lower muscle and testis. The escort protein mRNA is also abundant in heart, much lower in muscle, and not detectable in testis. In the case of the α subunit of rat protein geranylgeranyl transferase I (35Chen W.-J. Andres D.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11368-11372Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which is the same protein as that of protein farnesyl transferase, the amount of the mRNA is rather low in heart and muscle, whereas the amount in testis is severalfold higher than in any other tissue. It would be difficult at present to explain the reason why the mRNA levels of these enzymes directly related to GGPP metabolism are regulated differently especially in these tissues. It is very important to establish how many genes encode GGPPSase, which gene is transcripted in each tissue, and how each gene is regulated. FPPSase has been reported to be encoded by multiple genes (19Clarke C.F. Tanaka R.D. Svenson K. Wamsley M. Fogelman A.M. Edwards P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3138-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Sheares B.T. White S.S. Molowa D.T. Chan K. Ding V.D.-H. Kroon P.A. Bostedor R.G. Karkas J.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8129-8135Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Further analysis of mammalian GGPPSase will contribute to the understanding of a finely tuned mechanism of mevalonate pathway. Sepp-Lorenzino et al. (36Sepp-Lorenzino L. Rao S. Coleman P.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) reported cell cycle-dependent differential prenylation of proteins. LXRα has been reported to display constitutive transcriptional activity that is negatively regulated with GGPP (15Forman B.M. Ruan B. Chen J. Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10588-10593Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It remains unclear how GGPP inhibits LXRα and contributes to signaling pathways. It would be also very interesting to know the regulation of GGPP formation in the process of embryonic development and cell differentiation."

F1-ATPase shows a complicated kinetic behavior in ATP hydrolysis. Three catalytic sites in F1-ATPase are not independent but are related to one another in a cooperative manner. Binding of ATP to the catalytic sites is governed by negative cooperativity, and inversely, hydrolysis of bound ATP at each catalytic site is governed by positive cooperativity. When substoichiometric amounts of ATP relative to the enzyme are added, ATP is hydrolyzed very slowly (uni-site catalysis) (8Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol.

As a whole, ATP hydrolysis reaction by F1-ATPase usually exhibits negative cooperativity as a function of ATP concentration (11Muneyuki E. Odaka M. Yoshida M.

These and other features had been unified into the binding change mechanism by Boyer (3Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). According to the mechanism, three catalytic sites interchange their roles alternately and sequentially during catalytic turnover accompanying the rotation of γ subunit in the center of the enzyme. Consistent with this rotary mechanism, the α3β3γ subcomplex of thermophilicBacillus PS3 F1-ATPase (TF1) containing two intact and one incompetent catalytic sites lost the ability to mediate catalytic turnover while it showed uni-site ATP hydrolysis and chase-promotion (17Amano T. Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18128-18133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The rotation of the γ subunit was supported by various methods (18Gogol E.P. Johnston E. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). Another complication of F1-ATPase kinetics is caused by the “Mg-ADP inhibited form” (22Matsui T. Muneyuki E.

Acta. 1993; 1144: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In general, F1-ATPases from mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria are prone to develop turnover-dependent inactivation; Mg-ADP trapped transiently in a catalytic site causes the slow transition from an active form to an inhibited form called as Mg-ADP inhibited form (26Bulygin V.V. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem.

The slow transition during catalysis is accelerated by the simultaneous occupation of two catalytic sites by Mg-nucleotides (25Muneyuki E. Makino M. Kamata H. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Hirata H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Grodsky N.B. Dou C. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mg-ATP bound to the noncatalytic nucleotide binding site promotes dissociation of inhibitory Mg-ADP from the affected catalytic site (30Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, when the enzyme is preincubated with stoichiometric Mg-ADP, the Mg-ADP inhibited form is generated. An inhibitor of F1-ATPase, azide stabilizes the Mg-ADP inhibited form (23Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Murataliev M.B. Milgrom Y.M. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8305-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Muneyuki E. Makino M. Kamata H. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Hirata H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and an activator of F1-ATPase,N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide (LDAO) destabilizes it (31Paik S.R. Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of MF1 (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar) revealed that three β subunits in the MF1 molecule are in different states; one β (βTP) has an ATP analog, Mg-AMP-PNP, at its catalytic site; another β (βDP) has Mg-ADP; the third β (βE) has none. The structures of βTP and βDP are very similar to each other, and they are in the “closed” conformation, in which the carboxyl-terminal domain is lifted close to the nucleotide binding domain. In contrast, βE adopts the “open” conformation, in which the crevice for substrate binding is open. This crystal structure, characterized by two closed and one open β subunits (“CCO” conformational state) has been assumed to be a “snapshot” of MF1 cycling the catalytic turnover along the pathway predicted by the binding change mechanism. Whether this assumption is really the case has not been established by experiments. To address this question, we need a specific probe to detect the CCO conformational state of F1-ATPase in solution. Looking at the structure of MF1 carefully, we noticed that the two closed β subunits, even though separated by an intervening α subunit, have a direct contact at the position of Ile-390 of each β subunit (see Fig. 1, A and B). If this Ile is replaced with Cys, two closed β subunits in F1-ATPase in the CCO conformation would be cross-linked by a disulfide bond, and it would fix two β subunits in the closed conformation. Indeed, when we examined this experiment using α3β3γ subcomplex of TF1, the cross-link was formed in an Mg-nucleotide-dependent, azide-facilitated manner with concomitant loss of the activity of catalytic turnover. Escherichia coli strains used were JM109 (32Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) for preparation of plasmids, CJ236 (33Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) for generating uracil-containing single-stranded plasmid for site-directed mutagenesis, and JM103D (uncB-uncD) (34Monticello R.A. Angov E. Brusilow W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3370-3376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for expression of the wild-type and mutant α3β3γ subcomplexes of TF1. Plasmid pTABG3 (6Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which carried genes for the α, β, and γ subunit of TF1 was used for mutagenesis and expression. A helper phage M13KO7 was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo. The expression plasmid for the mutant subcomplex was constructed as follows. The mutation (Ile → Cys at β-386) was introduced into pTABG3 (6Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) by using a synthetic oligonucleotide: 5′-TTGTCTTCATCCGACAGTTCATCCATCCCCAAGCATGCGATGATGTCTTGCAATTCTTTATAACGTTCGA-3′ (changed bases are underlined) (33Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). TheEcoRI-BglII fragment from the resultant plasmid was ligated into the EcoRI-BglII site of pKABG3 to produce the expression plasmid, pKAG3-β-Ile386Cys. Recombinant DNA procedures were performed as described in the manual (35). The wild-type and the mutant α3β3γ subcomplexes were purified and stored as described previously except that 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) was added in all buffers (6Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,17Amano T. Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18128-18133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Just before use, they were subjected to gel-filtration HPLC with a TSK-G3000SWXL column (Tosoh, Japan) equilibrated with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.0), 200 mm NaCl (Tris-NaCl buffer). Gel-filtrated preparation of the mutant subcomplex did not contain a detectable amount of endogenously bound adenine nucleotide (<0.1 mol/mol of subcomplex). In the presence of LDAO, the mutant subcomplex showed the steady-state ATPase activity of 15.2 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg at 25 °C, which is ∼70% of that of the wild-type subcomplex (21.3 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg). In the absence of LDAO, the activity was 4.6 (mutant subcomplex) and 7.7 (wild-type subcomplex) μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg. The subcomplexes were incubated at 25 °C in Tris-NaCl buffer containing indicated components. At the indicated time, an aliquot was taken out and formation of the cross-link was analyzed with 10.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate without exposure to a reducing reagent (non-reducing SDS-PAGE) (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). To prevent further oxidation during electrophoresis, all sample solutions were treated with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 5 min prior to electrophoresis. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The yields of the cross-linked product were determined from the staining intensity of bands with a photodensitometer (model SM3, Howtec Inc.) using the α subunit band as an internal standard. The wild-type and mutant subcomplexes were incubated in 20 μm ATP and 2 mm MgCl2 for 2.5 h at 25 °C. The yield of cross-linked β dimer of the mutant subcomplex estimated from non-reducing SDS-PAGE was nearly 100% after this incubation. As a control, the samples treated with the same procedures, except that 10 mm DTT was included in the solution, were also analyzed. To remove free adenine nucleotide, the samples were passed through an HPLC column TSK-G3000SWXL. The protein fractions were recovered, and perchloric acid was added to precipitate proteins. The amounts of adenine nucleotides contained in the supernatant were measured with reversed-phase HPLC on a Cosmosil 5C18-AR-II (Nacarai Tesque, Japan), equilibrated, and eluted with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9). ATPase activity was measured at 25 °C in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (37Stiggal D.L. Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Unless stated, a neutral detergent, LDAO, was included in the assay mixture to eliminate the effect of the initial lag phase caused by the Mg-ADP inhibition (31Paik S.R. Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2.5 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NADH, 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 50 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 0.1% LDAO. Uni-site ATPase activity and chase promotion were measured at 26 and 8 °C using TNP-ATP as a substrate as described previously (38Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Odaka M. Yokoyama K. Mochizuki K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4551-4556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4 mmMgCl2, 200 mm KCl, and 0.3 μmTNP-ATP was incubated at 26 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of an equal volume of 1 μm subcomplexes in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The reaction was quenched by the addition of 7.5 μl of ice-cold 24% perchloric acid. In chase-promotion experiments, 10 μl of 30 mm ATP-Mg was added instead of perchloric acid. After 5 s, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 7.5 μl of ice-cold 24% perchloric acid. The amounts of TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP were measured by HPLC (38Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Odaka M. Yokoyama K. Mochizuki K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4551-4556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For uni-site and chase-promotion experiments, the mutant subcomplex with the cross-link lacking bound nucleotide was prepared. The mutant subcomplex was treated with 100 μm CuCl2 for 24 h at 25 °C, and the subcomplex was separated from CuCl2 with gel filtration (Sephadex G-25 column, 2 cm × 5 cm). Formation of the cross-link at 100% yield was confirmed with SDS-PAGE before use. Protein concentration of α3β3γ subcomplex was determined by UV absorbance using the factor of 0.45 at 280 nm as 1.0 mg/ml. In the crystal structure of MF1, two β subunits with a bound nucleotide, βTP and βDP, take the closed conformation and contact each other at the carboxyl-terminal region near the central axis (Fig. 1,A and B, shown by an arrow). The residues in the contact position are Ile-390s of each of β subunits (Fig. 1, A and B, shown by red). The distance between α carbons of the two Ile-390s is 0.79 nm. The distance between the nearest carbon atoms (Cβ of βTP-Ile-390 and Cγ2 of βDP-Ile-390) is 0.42 nm, and the two residues actually appear to have hydrophobic interaction. On the contrary, the distance between α carbons of βTP-Ile-390 and βE-Ile-390 and that between βDP-Ile-390 and βE-Ile-390 are 2.40 nm and 2.58 nm, respectively. This residue is located in a region just preceding the “DELSEED sequence” (39Kagawa Y. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and is highly conserved in F1-ATPases from various sources. We generated a mutant α3β3γ subcomplex of TF1 in which β-Ile-386, an equivalent residue to MF1β-Ile-390, was replaced with Cys. ATPase activity of the mutant subcomplex was about 70% of that of the wild-type subcomplex (see “Experimental Procedures”). The cross-linked β dimer in the mutant subcomplex was detected by non-reducing SDS-PAGE after incubation at 25 °C for 2 h in the Tris-NaCl buffer containing 0.25 μm CuCl2 and indicated compounds (Fig.2). No new band other than three subunit bands, α, β, and γ was found in a reference sample, incubated alone or with DTT (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). When the solution contained Mg-ATP (lane 8), Mg-ADP (lane 9), or Mg-ADP + azide (lane 10), a 100-kDa protein band appeared. The exposure of the samples to a reducing reagent prior to electrophoresis eliminated the band (lane 12). It was identified to be a cross-linked β dimer because two-dimensional electrophoresis showed that the 100-kDa band in the first non-reducing SDS-PAGE was developed into a β subunit band in the second reducing SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Consistently, the staining intensities of the β subunit band in lanes 8–10 decreased in parallel with the increase of those of the β dimer band. Because the cross-link was formed in Mg-ADP, catalytic turnover of ATP hydrolysis is not absolutely required for the cross-linking. No cross-link was observed in AT(D)P + EDTA (lanes 5 and 6), ADP + azide + EDTA (lane 7), and Mg2+ alone (lane 11). Therefore, both AT(D)P and Mg2+ are necessary to form the cross-link. The cross-linked β dimer was formed even under air oxygen without CuCl2 and essentially the same dependence of the cross-linking on Mg-nucleotide were observed. However, the time courses of the cross-linking under air oxygen varied in the experiments in different days although they were reproducible in one sequence of experiments in the same day. By this reason, unless otherwise stated, we included 0.25 μm CuCl2in the reaction mixtures in which the cross-linking occurred at reproducible rates of the order of 10 min as described later. At high concentration of CuCl2 (100 μm), the cross-link was formed after a 2-h incubation in the absence of Mg-AT(D)P, but the yield of the cross-linked β dimer was partial (lane 3). At 100 μm CuCl2 in the presence of Mg-AT(D)P, the cross-link was formed instantaneously (see next paragraph). Prior treatment of the subcomplex with NEM prevented the cross-link (lane 4). As mentioned above, cross-linking occurs in Mg-ATP where the enzyme is catalyzing hydrolysis of ATP. When we added 100 μm CuCl2 during continuous assay of ATPase, ATP hydrolysis stopped almost immediately (<15 s), but the full activity was recovered by addition of 150 mm DTT (Fig.3 A, trace a). It should be noted that the solutions contained LDAO so that generation of the Mg-ADP inhibited form was avoided. ATPase activity of the mutant subcomplex pretreated with NEM (trace b) and that of the wild-type subcomplex (trace c) were not affected either by CuCl2 or DTT. This suggests that the cross-linking causes the loss of the activity to cycle the catalysis. Indeed, the time-course of the ATPase inactivation mirrored that of the yield of the cross-linked β-β dimer (Fig. 3 B), and the analysis of their correlation showed that the subcomplex containing a cross-linked β dimer completely lost the ability to mediate catalytic turnover of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 3 C). The inactivated subcomplex recovered a full activity by incubation with a reducing reagent, for example 100 mm DTT (data not shown). Rates of cross-linking were assessed by measuring the rates of ATPase inactivation in the presence of nucleotide and azide (Fig.4). To ensure that the residual ATPase activities at each time point reflect correctly the fraction of the native subcomplexes without the cross-link, they were measured in the ATPase assay solutions containing LDAO in which subcomplexes showed uninhibited linear activities without an initial lag. Inactivation of ATPase activities proceeded with single exponential curves (solid lines) most rapidly in Mg-ADP + azide, next in Mg-ADP, Mg-ATP + azide, and most slowly in Mg-ATP. The half-decay times were 3.6, 5.8, 10.2, and 21.0 min under the described conditions. Because the Mg-ADP inhibited form is produced most efficiently when F1-ATPase is incubated with Mg-ADP and it is further facilitated by azide (23Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Murataliev M.B. Milgrom Y.M. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8305-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Muneyuki E. Makino M. Kamata H. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Hirata H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the conformation of the Mg-ADP inhibited form appears to be favorable for the cross-linking. To estimate how many nucleotides were required for the formation of the cross-link at 0.25 μmCuCl2, the mutant subcomplex was incubated with various concentrations of Mg-ADP and Mg-TNP-ADP, and the final yield of the cross-linked β dimer was measured. At low concentrations of nucleotides, cross-linking proceeded slowly and it was safe to wait for 24 h to reach the final, maximum yield (Fig.5). Formation of the cross-link was saturated when the concentrations of Mg-nucleotide, expressed as a molar ratio Mg-nucleotide:subcomplex, reached 3:1. It should be noted that at molar ratio 1:1, cross-linked β dimer was formed in only a small fraction of the subcomplex (20%, Mg-ADP; 3%, Mg-TNP-ADP) but at molar ratio 2:1, 50% or more populations of the subcomplexes had a cross-linked β dimer. Similar results were obtained when the subcomplex was incubated with Mg-ATP and Mg-TNP-ATP (not shown). It was demonstrated previously from difference absorption spectrum titration that, when added with 1:1 molar ratio at micromolar range, almost all Mg-TNP-ADP bound to a catalytic site of the subcomplex (7Kaibara C. Matsui T. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2433-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Also, nearly all Mg-ADP added at 1:1 molar ratio was bound to the subcomplex (22Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 40Jault J.-M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, for cross-linking to occur, occupation of a single catalytic site by Mg-nucleotide is not sufficient but at least two catalytic sites need to be filled by Mg-nucleotides. The amount of bound nucleotide in the mutant subcomplex was measured after the cross-link was formed in Mg-ATP (Table I). Unbound nucleotide was removed by gel filtration, and nucleotide bound to the subcomplex in a stable manner was analyzed. For comparison, two samples, the wild-type subcomplex incubated with Mg-ATP and the mutant subcomplex incubated with Mg-ATP + DTT were also analyzed. The mutant subcomplex incubated with Mg-ATP + DTT had only a trace amount of bound nucleotide. The mutant subcomplex after formation of the cross-link retained about 2 mol/mol bound ADP (Mg2+ was not analyzed). This result indicates that when the carboxyl-terminal domains of the two β subunits are fixed in the closed conformation by the cross-link, two Mg-ADPs remain trapped in their catalytic sites. The wild-type subcomplex had about 1 mol/mol bound ADP (Table I). It can bind as much as 3 mol/mol Mg-ADP when analyzed with equilibrium dialysis (5Yokoyama K. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21837-21841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but 2 mol of Mg-ADP probably dissociated upon separation from unbound Mg-ADP during gel filtration. Related to our observation, it was reported that when α subunit and γ (or ε) subunit of E. coliF1-ATPase were cross-linked, entrapped nucleotide (ATP or ADP) cannot be released (41Gruber G. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32623-32628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Table IQuantitative analysis of bound nucleotidesα3β3γCross-linkingaFrom the non-reducing SDS-PAGE.Bound ADPbAverage of two experiments.%mol/molI386C00.1I386C1002.0Wild type—1.3a From the non-reducing SDS-PAGE.b Average of two experiments. Open table in a new tab Hydrolysis of a substoichiometric amount of substrate (uni-site catalysis) and its acceleration by chase-added ATP (chase-promotion) of the subcomplex with the cross-link were measured. To avoid confusion arising from bound Mg-ADP, nucleotide-free subcomplex with the cross-link was prepared in 100 μmCuCl2 in the absence of nucleotide. The subcomplex thus prepared did not have the activity of steady-state ATP hydrolysis, but it retained the ability to catalyze uni-site hydrolysis of TNP-ATP (Fig. 6). The rates of uni-site catalysis of the subcomplexes with and without the cross-link were almost the same at 26 °C (Fig. 6, A and B, closed circles), and chase-promotion was also observed for both (open circles). This result indicates that a single high affinity catalytic site and its communication with the second catalytic site of the subcomplex are not lost by the cross-linking. However, the efficiency of the communication was diminished because at low temperature, 8 °C, chase-promotion observed for the subcomplex with the cross-link was very poor compared with that of the subcomplex without the cross-link (Fig. 6, A and B,insets). Intersubunit cross-linking has been proved to be a useful method in the study of F1-ATPase to know relative location and motion of subunits (19Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the α3β3 subcomplex of TF1, the whole structure is arranged in an exact three-fold symmetry, and all three β subunits are in the open conformation (43Shirakihara Y. Leslie A. Abrahams J.P. Walker J.E. Ueda T. Sekimoto Y. Kambara M. Saika K. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 825-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The distance between Ile-386s of the two β subunits in this subcomplex is 3.27 nm, and a disulfide bond would not be possible even if β-Ile-386s are replaced with Cys. By substituting the closed β subunit in the crystal structure of MF1 with the open βEsubunit with the aid of a computer, we generated the structure of the α3β3γ subcomplex with one closed and two open β subunits (COO conformational state) (Fig. 1 C) and that with three open β subunits (OOO conformational state) (Fig.1 D). β-Ile-390s in the COO conformational state are distant from each other. The distances between Ile390 of the closed β and that of each of the two open βs are 2.42 and 3.65 nm, too far for cross-linking. This is also the case for the OOO conformational state; β-Ile390s are far away from each other, just similar to α3β3 subcomplex of TF1 (43Shirakihara Y. Leslie A. Abrahams J.P. Walker J.E. Ueda T. Sekimoto Y. Kambara M. Saika K. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 825-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Only when two β subunits take the closed conformation (CCO conformational state) do their lifted carboxyl-terminal domains bring β-Ile-390s into the contact position (Fig. 1, A andB). One might think of a CCC conformational state, but when we generated CCC conformational state based on the MF1structure, γ subunit could not be accommodated in the center of the molecule without steric collision. Therefore, it is unlikely that all three β subunits take closed conformations. Thus, β-β cross-linking between the introduced Cys at the position β-386 of TF1 is a specific means to identify the CCO conformational state of F1-ATPase in solution. This rationale should be valid for F1-ATPases from other sources. The cross-link was formed in the solution containing Mg-ATP and ATP regeneration system where catalysis was going on (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, at least one of the intermediates in the catalytic cycle of the subcomplex takes the CCO conformation. 2One can argue that the Mg-ADP inhibited form, but not an active intermediate, is the molecular species in which cross-link is formed under the conditions in Fig. 3 A because the Mg-ADP inhibited form, which also takes the CCO conformation, is generated more or less in a dynamic equilibrium during catalysis. However, this argument may not be the case. The solution contained LDAO, an activator known to keep F1-ATPases from falling into the Mg-ADP inhibited form during catalysis and ATP regenerating system to convert the free ADP into ATP. Therefore, the fraction of the Mg-ADP inhibited form should be minimal in the solution. The inactivation of ATPase activity, which was caused by cross-linking, occurred immediately when 100 μm CuCl2 was added. If the cross-link had been formed only from the Mg-ADP inhibited form, the inactivation would have proceeded very slowly in the presence of LDAO. Because azide stabilizes the Mg-ADP inhibited form (23Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Murataliev M.B.

Acta. 1993; 1144: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), accelerated formation of cross-linking in Mg-ATP by azide (Fig. 4) indicates that the Mg-ADP inhibited form, which is probably derivatized from the catalytic intermediate(s) with a CCO conformation as mentioned above, also takes a CCO conformation. This contention is supported by the fact that cross-linking occurs even more efficiently in Mg-ADP and Mg-ADP + azide, conditions where the Mg-ADP inhibited form is produced efficiently. Requirement for 2 mol of Mg-nucleotide per mol of the subcomplex for the cross-linking (Fig. 5) is consistent with the observation that the rate of development of azide inhibition during ATP hydrolysis was saturated at an ATP concentration of about 10 μm, a concentration range of bi-site catalysis where the enzyme operates with two catalytic sites being occupied by substrates (22Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It has been known that Mg-free AT(D)P can bind to catalytic sites of F1-ATPase but not to noncatalytic nucleotide binding site (44Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11261-11268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α3β3γ subcomplex can bind 3 mol of Mg-free ADP per mol (5Yokoyama K. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21837-21841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the cross-linked β dimer was not formed in Mg-free AT(D)P (Fig. 2). This indicates that subcomplex with bound Mg-free AT(D)P at catalytic site(s) dwells in a conformational state, probably either in a COO or OOO conformational state, in which two or three β subunits are in open conformations. In this respect, the liganding of Mg2+ to nucleotide at the catalytic site has a great effect on the conformation of the β subunit; shifting the carboxyl-terminal domain from the open position to the closed one. Probably related to this, the profound effect of Mg2+ on the binding affinity of AT(D)P to the catalytic sites of F1-ATPase was reported by Senior's group (44Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, we previously observed that chemical labeling of β-Glu-190, a catalytic residue acting as a general base in ATP hydrolysis reaction (17Amano T. Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18128-18133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was completely blocked when Mg2+ was liganded in a catalytic site (46Yoshida M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14407-14412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant subcomplex cannot catalyze multiple catalytic turnover when the cross-link was formed (Fig. 3). Because multiple catalytic turnover of F1-ATPase couples with rotation of γ subunit, indication of this result is that, when two β subunits are fixed in the closed conformation, the rotation of the γ subunit is blocked. The open-closed conformational transition of each of the β subunits and exchange of the CC (β-closed, β-closed) pair among three β subunits appear to be necessary for the rotation of the γ subunit and mechanical prevention of this transition by the cross-linking results in blocking the rotation and, thereby, turnover of ATPase cycle. Probably by the same reason, E. coliF1-ATPase in which the residue β-381, an equivalent residue of TF1 β-E391, is labeled by a bulky fluorescent dye is inactive in ATPase catalytic turnover (42Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In a sense, the mechanism of inactivation caused by cross-linking may be similar to that of the Mg-ADP inhibition, blocking sequential transition of the intermediate states in catalysis of the enzyme. The difference is that the former blocks physically and the latter does kinetically. Once the cross-link is formed in the Mg-ADP inhibited form, the transition is now physically blocked. Based on the experiments of the β-γ cross-linked E. coliF1-ATPase, Capaldi's group has proposed that uni-site catalysis does not accompany the rotation (47Garcia J.J. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15940-15945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our result, that the subcomplex with the β-β cross-link can catalyze uni-site TNP-ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 6), again reinforces this conclusion. Mere hydrolysis of a single ATP probably does not require the open-closed transition of the β subunits. Furthermore, because the uni-site catalysis by the subcomplex with the β-β cross-link was promoted by chase-added ATP (Fig. 6), communication between two β subunits in the enzyme is still possible without open-closed transition of the β subunits. Probably the open-closed transition of the β subunits is needed to drive the critical catalytic step, i.e. simultaneous exchange of the role of each catalytic site."

The most abundantly expressed VEGF isoform is the homodimeric VEGF165 with an apparent molecular weight of 43,000. VEGF is a member of the cysteine knot family of growth factors and thus structurally related to the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) (20Keck P.J.

VEGF-B heterodimerizes with VEGF165 in vitro and is particularly expressed in muscle.

The two VEGF receptors I and II with apparent molecular weights of about 220,000 consist of seven immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains, one transmembrane stretch, and intracellular split tyrosine kinase domains. These structural elements relate the VEGF receptors closely to the platelet-derived growth factor α/β receptors having five extracellular immunoglobin-like domains and pertaining to the class III tyrosine kinase receptors (30Shibuya M.

The VEGFR I and II bind most likely to different VEGF epitopes dominated by basic and acidic residues, respectively, which appear to be essential for ligand-receptor interaction (33Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V.

This is further indicated by the finding that placental-like growth factor competes for VEGF binding at VEGFR I but not at VEGFR II (34Barleon B. Totzke F. Herzog C. Blanke S. Kremmer E.

When deletion mutants of VEGFR I were constructed lacking extracellular Ig-like domains only the deletion of domain 2 abolished VEGF binding completely. Binding was restored by substituting with domain 2 of VEGFR II. However, the specificity had changed and the placental-like growth factor did not displace VEGF any longer (35Davis-Smyth T. Chen H.

Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), have mapped their VEGF-binding site to the first three N-terminal globular domains. Concomittant with the recognition of different binding sites, the VEGFR I and II appear to exhibit different functions in angiogenesis. While VEGFR II is mediating the stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation during angiogenesis and vasculogenesis (13Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnürch H. Martinez R. Moller N.P.H. Risau W. Ullrich A.

Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar). VEGFR I-deficient embryos die at day 10.5 of gestation. Although angioblasts are formed the assembly into functional blood vessels is impaired. Similarly died homocygotic VEGFR II deficient embryos at day 8.5 with no vessels forming and defects in angioplastic and hematopoietic lineages (38Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M.

But recently the high resolution crystal structures of VEGF (21Muller Y.A. Li B. Christinger H.W. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. de Vos A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This VEGF mutation studies demonstrated that high affinity binding of VEGF to VEGFR II is dependent on the presence of three locally vicinal isoleucins (Ile43, Ile46, and Ile83) and positively charged amino acids Arg82, Lys84, and His86 in VEGF. In addition, Asn63, Glu64, and Glu67 are important especially for VEGFR II binding. The aim of our investigations was to contribute to the topology of VEGF-VEGFR II interaction and to use that knowledge to design novel VEGF inhibitors. In the present study we report the mapping and characterization of a putative VEGF165/VEGFR II contact site using cellulose-bound peptide libraries derived from the VEGFR II sequence. The resulting peptide was characterized with respect to VEGF165 binding, inhibition of VEGFR II autophosphorylation, as well as growth and migration of microvascular endothelial cells. Cellulose-bound and cleavable sets of peptides (PepSpotsTM and Cleavable PepSpotsTM, Jerini Bio Tools GmbH, Berlin, Germany) were automatically prepared according to standard spot synthesis protocols (40Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (924) Google Scholar) using a spot synthesizer (Abimed GmbH, Langenfeld, Germany) as described previously (41Kramer A. Schuster A. Reineke U. Malin R.

After desorption from the cellulose matrix with buffer the peptide solution was directly used in the test system. For generation of the sequence files, the in house developed software DIGEN was applied. Soluble peptides in milligram quantities were synthesized as amides on a multiple peptide synthesizer AMS 422 (Abimed) according to the standard Fmoc machine protocol (43Gausepohl H. Boulin C. Kraft M. Frank R.W. Pept. Res. 1992; 5: 315-320PubMed Google Scholar) using TentaGel S RAM resin (50 mmol/g; Rapp Polymere, Tübingen, Germany) and PyBOP activation. All peptides were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 column using a linear gradient 5–60% acetonitrile/water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) for 20 min at 1.2 ml/min flow rate (detection at 214 nm) and by laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix (LaserTec fOCUS mass spectrometer; VESTEC/Perseptive Biosystems, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany). Peptide libraries bound covalently to cellulose membranes were incubated in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween 20). After two changes of buffer the paper was blocked by incubation for 60 min in TBS/Tween 20 containing 5% milk powder at 4° C. To this solution125I-VEGF165 was added to a concentration of 0.1 μC/ml. The incubation was continued for 60 min before the cellulose libraries were washed three times with TBS/Tween 20. Overnight the cellulose sheets were placed together with an autoradiography film (Reflection NEF 496, DuPont, Bad Homburg, Germany) and an intensifying screen NEF 491 (DuPont) before the film was developed. Binding peptides were detected as black dots. Human umbilical cords were canulated with a conical device, which was fixed by a thread, and flushed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing calcium, magnesium (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany), penicillin (500 units/ml), and streptomycin (1000 μg/ml) to remove blood cells. The veins were then filled with PBS containing chymotrypsin (0.1% w/v) and incubated at room temperature for 25 min. After slight manual massage of the umbilical cords the cell suspension was brought into a tube containing 2 ml of fetal calf serum. After dilution with buffer, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once in buffer, and seeded into two 25-cm2 flasks (coated with 10 μg/ml Collagen) per cord in medium 199 (M199) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 10% human serum, glutamin, or glutamax (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), ascorbic acid (1.27 mm), pyruvic acid (1 mm), and 1% nonessential amino acids (Biochrom), 6 μg/ml endothelial growth factor from bovine brain (Sigma), and 7.5 μg/ml heparin (Sigma). After 2–3 h of plating we washed the adherent cells twice with PBS and cells were cultured under standard conditions in medium described above. Cells were passaged by trypsin digestion (0.02% trypsin, 0.01% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline without bivalent ions) into microtiter plates at a density of 1.6 × 104 cells/well and cultured from 3 to 7 days. Preparation of magnetic beads according to Jacksonet al. (Ref. 44Jackson C.J. Garbett P.K. Nissen B. Schrieber L. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 257-262PubMed Google Scholar, 10Millauer B. Shawver L.K.

Nature. 1994; 367: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar million Dynabeads (anti-mouse Ig coated by means of an DNA linker)) were washed with PBS/bovine serum albumin (BSA) three times using the magnetic device. Anti-CD31 antibody (Immunotech, Westbrook, ME) was added at a concentration of 3.5 μg/10 million beads and shaken for 30 min. The suspension was washed five times with PBS/BSA and stored in 1.25 ml of 0.01% azide containing PBS/BSA at 4° C. Beads were washed directly before use to remove azide. Human Foreskin was washed with PBS containing penicillin (1000 units/ml) and streptomycin (1000 μg/ml) to remove blood. The skin was cut in 1 ml of PBS into 2 × 2-mm pieces and left for 60 min in 0.3% trypsin/EDTA in PBS in the incubator at 37° C. Trypsin was removed and the skin fragments were incubated for 4 h with dispase grade II (2.4 units/ml; Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) at 37° C. The dermis of the skin was scraped with a spatula and the resulting cell suspension was diluted in PBS and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in complete medium and filtered over a 100-μm net. The cell suspension was distributed in one or two culture wells of 10-cm2 area. After 16 h in the incubator adherent cells were washed several times with PBS and culture was continued until 50% confluence is observed. Cell mixtures originating from 10 cm2 surface were incubated at 4° C with 300,000 washed beads of the preparation for 15 min and then washed cautiously five times with cold PBS/BSA. To the pellet 50 μl of M199 containing 1% fetal calf serum and 200 units of DNase was added and incubation was continued for 15 min at 37° C. Then the cells were plated into a collagen-coated tissue culture flask in the same full medium as HUVEC. VEGF165 binding to soluble extracellular fragment of VEGFR II (sVEGFR II) using microtiter plates (Maxisorb, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) shaken for 30 min with 50 μl of sVEGFR II solution in PBS (Biochrom), in concentrations of about 0.4 μg depending on the preparation. Then 200 μl of 4% BSA in PBS was added for another 30 min. The solution was removed and the plates were washed with 0.1% BSA in PBS. 10 μl of compounds in PBS, 0.1% BSA were added and 40 μl of125I-VEGF165 (approximately 15,000 cpm or 300–600 pm) was added in PBS, 0.1% BSA. The incubation mixture was shaken for 60 min and radioactivity was removed. After three washes with 0.1% BSA in PBS, 100 μl of 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was added and the plate was shaken for 30 min. 80 μl of the solution was utilized for γ-counting. 300,000 HUVECs were seeded per well (24-well plates) and cells were cultured for 2 days in complete medium. Cells were washed with PBS containing calcium and magnesium chloride (Biochrom). At 4° C 100 μl of medium M199 without additives but containing 0.1% BSA was added followed by 10 μl of peptide solution, that had been dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted appropriately in advance, and 40 μl of125I-VEGF165. After 2 h of incubation at 4° C the medium was aspirated and washed three times with 500 μl of PBS. The cells were lysed with 100 μl of 0.5% SDS solution by vigorous shaking. The solution was transferred to a counting vial and γ-radiation was measured. The result is given as the concentration that reduces specific binding to 50%. 100,000 MVECs were plated into a 12-well plate. After 48 h the cells were put on ice and fresh medium containing the solvent control, VEGF165 or VEGF165 plus peptides in ice-cold medium M199 with 0.1% BSA was added. Incubation was continued for 1 h. The medium was removed and ice-cold RIPA buffer was added (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm zinc acetate, 1.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin). The DNA was removed by filtering through a Millipore filter (0.65 μm). 50 μl of wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose was added to the filtrate and the mixture was incubated under rolling for 1 h at 4° C. Sepharose was separated by centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and 25 μl of twice concentrated SDS-electrophoresis buffer according to Laemmli was added and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated on a 6% SDS gel according to size. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semidry electroblotting. The membrane was blocked by 0.25% Tween 20 in PBS containing magnesium and calcium chloride. After three washes for 15 min with 0.05% Tween 20 in the same buffer, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY-20, Transduction Laboratories, Inc., Lexington, Ky) was added at a final concentration of 250 ng/ml. After three washes for 15 min each, the blot was developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany). Alternatively the blot was developed for control purposes with a poly- or monoclonal antibody against VEGFR II (Dr. Towbin, Basel; Dr. Martiny-Baron, Freiburg, Germany). TF-1 cells (CRL-2003, ATCC, Manassas, VA) that had been cultured in the presence of 2 ng/ml granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor were centrifuged. Three million cells in 50 μl of PBS containing 0.1% BSA were transferred into wells of a C96 white microtiter plates (Maxisorb, Nunc) that had been coated previously with 1 μg/ml anti-c-kit = CD 117 antibody (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ) overnight at pH 9.6 and then blocked with BSA. 10 μl of inhibitor solution was added 5 min before stem cell factor (40 μl, 1 nm) was added. Incubation time was 60 min at 4° C. Cells were lysed in the original plate with 50 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm HEPES pH 7.1, 450 mm sodium chloride, 3 mm magnesium chloride, 30 mm sodium diphosphate (Na4P2O7), 300 mmsodium flouride, 3 mm sodium vanadate (Na3VO4), 30% glycerol, 4.5% Triton X-100, 3 tablets/50 ml of protease inhibitor mixture (B#1836145, Boehringer Mannheim GmbH). After washing several times (50 mm Tris pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, Tween 0.1%), the wells were incubated with 1:20,000-fold diluted anti-phosphotyrosine antibody horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (4G10, Upstate Ltd., Lake Placid, NY) and after repeated washings developed using chemiluminescence substrate (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH), according to the manufacturer. Endothelial cells were passaged and maintained overnight in medium 199, 10% fetal calf serum, 10% human serum containing glutamin, penicillin, and streptomycin but no growth factors. The next day cells were detached from the culture plates with trypsin. Ten thousand cells in 100 μl of M199 containing 2% human serum and glutamin were given into a culture well insert with a porous filter bottom that had been washed with PBS and coated with collagen (10 μg/ml) previously. In the lower chamber are 600 μl of medium (M199 + 2% human serum). After 2 h at standard culture conditions VEGF165 (250 pm final concentration) and 10 μl of the inhibitors were added. The medium was mixed by cautious swirling and cells were incubated for an additional 18 h. The inserts were rinsed with PBS and stained by immersion into a PBS solution containing 1% rose bengal in 30% of ethanol. Excess rose bengal was removed by washing with PBS. Cells from the upper side of the insert were removed by cotton swaps. For quantification randomized inserts were evaluated under the microscope counting three field each of three independent experiments. Quantitative image scan was performed with Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). 50,000 cells were plated into a 24-well plate in full medium based on M199. After 2 h the medium was changed to 3% human serum. The next morning various amounts of VEGF165 and inhibitors were added. After 3 days in culture the cells were washed and 1% rose bengal in 30% ethanol was added. After 5 min the dye solution was removed, and the cells were washed three times thoroughly with PBS and lysed with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate in PBS. Optical density of the resulting solutions was determined at 560 nm. Two scans of overlapping peptides (13-mers, shifted by 2 amino acids) derived from the entire soluble VEGFR II (sVEGFR II) sequence were independently synthesized (Fig. 1). In the second scan (Fig. 1 B) all cysteine residues in the peptides were substituted by serine to prevent unspecific disulfide bridging of the target molecule (125I-VEGF165). Incubation of both scans with radiolabeled125I-VEGF165 was performed utilizing only short washing times in order to permit kinetically rapid binding processes. The peptide scan with cysteine containing peptides probed with soluble125I-VEGF165 showed eight strong spots (Fig.1 A), whereas the peptide scan with the serine substitutions (Fig. 1 B) displayed only two spots (124 and 125) corresponding to the peptide sequences247RTELNVGIDFNWE259 and249ELNVGIDFNWEYP261 of VEGFR II. The activity bound to spots 124 and 125 could be easily stripped with routinely used buffers (Tween 20, Tris-buffered saline, data not shown). In contrast, the activity displayed on spots 227–229 and 236–239 (Fig.1 A), where all corresponding peptides contain a cystein residue, could only be removed under reducing conditions indicating nonspecific disulfide bridging of the ligand with the matrix-bound peptides. The specific signals of the spots 124 and 125, which thus were reproduced in two independent experiments (Fig. 1), represent an amino acid sequence located in the third globular domain of the extracellular part of the VEGFR II. A complete L-substitution analysis of the peptide249ELNVGIDFNWEYP261 (Fig. 1, A andB), spot 125, which exhibits the stronger signal in the peptide scan in comparison to spot 124) in which all residues were replaced by all other 19 L-amino acids (Fig.2) was performed to determine the residues involved in binding of VEGF165. The results indicate that Asp255 is the essential residue for peptide binding since no other amino ac"

X-ray diffraction and surface plasmon resonance experiments have been employed to study the mechanism of “homophilic binding,” in which molecules of R24 recognize and bind to other molecules of R24 though their heavy chain variable domains. R24 exhibits strong binding to liposomes containing disialoganglioside GD3; however, the kinetics are unusual in that saturation of binding is not observed. The binding of chR24 to GD3-bearing liposomes is significantly weaker, suggesting that cooperative interactions involving antibody constant regions contribute to R24 binding of membrane-bound GD3. The crystal structures of the Fabs from R24 and chR24 reveal the mechanism for homophilic binding and confirm that the homophilic and antigen-binding idiotopes are distinct. The homophilic binding idiotope is formed largely by an anti-parallel β-sheet dimerization between the H2 complementarity determining region (CDR) loops of two Fabs, while the antigen-binding idiotope is a pocket formed by the three CDR loops on the heavy chain. The formation of homophilic dimers requires the presence of a canonical conformation for the H2 CDR in conjunction with participation of side chains. The relative positions of the homophilic and antigen-binding sites allows for a lattice of GD3-specific antibodies to be constructed, which is stabilized by the presence of the cell membrane. This model provides for the selective recognition by R24 of cells that overexpress GD3 on the cell surface.

Successful therapy depends on many factors, such as the recognition and binding of the antibody to the tumor antigen, and the subsequent induction of an immune response leading to tumor cell death. Research into cell-surface tumor antigens has concentrated on human melanoma malignancies, and several have been found that can induce either a humoral or cellular immune response (1Lloyd K.O. Bystryn J.-C. Ferrone S. Livingston P. Specific Immunotherapy of Cancer with Vaccines. New York Academy of Sciences, New York1993: 50-58Google Scholar, 2Boon T. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, few antigens have been identified that are recognized by both components of the immune system. At least six humoral-mediated melanoma antigens have been reported to date, of which four have been found to be gangliosides (1Lloyd K.O. Bystryn J.-C. Ferrone S. Livingston P. Specific Immunotherapy of Cancer with Vaccines. New York Academy of Sciences, New York1993: 50-58Google Scholar, 2Boon T. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Gangliosides are glycolipids consisting of a ceramide tail with an oligosaccharide head group and have long been implicated in cellular interactions, differentiation and oncogenesis (3Hakamori S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 733-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). The ceramide moiety is sequestered within the membrane, leaving the carbohydrate moiety exposed to immune surveillance. One challenge encountered in exploiting some gangliosides as tumor antigens can be poor observed immunogenicity. This may be due, in part, to a limited presence of the ganglioside on the surface of noncancerous tissues leading to a degree of immune tolerance, and to the fact that gangliosides do not stimulate T-cell help. The low immunogenicity of some gangliosides is offset by the density with which they may be expressed on the surface of malignant cells. A further factor is the diversity of available antigens (4Irie R.F. Ravindranath M.H. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Larrick J.W. Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies. Stockton Press, New York1990: 75-85Crossref Google Scholar), where the relative abundance of many gangliosides on the cell surface changes during cancerous mutation with each different ganglioside providing a possible venue for therapy (5Albino A.P. Houghton A.N. Eisinger M. Lee J.S. Kantor R.R. Oliff A.I. Old L.J. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1710-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Carubia J.M. Yu R.K. Macala L.J. Kirkwood J.M. Varga J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). One such antigen is disialoganglioside GD3, which is overexpressed on the surface of melanomas, soft tissue sarcomas, and tumors of neuroectodermal origin, while normal tissues display little or no GD3 (7Hamilton W.B. Helling F. Boon K.O. Livingston P.O. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 53: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Four forms of GD3 have been identified, which vary somewhat in the substitution pattern of the terminal NANA residue (8Pukel C.S. Lloyd K.O. Travassos L.R. Dippold W.G. Oettgen H.F. Old L.J. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 155: 1133-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 9Thurin J. Herlyn M. Hindsgaul O. Stromberg N. Karlsson K.A. Elder D. Steplewski Z. Koprowski H. J. Biol.

The best characterized GD3 has the structure NANA-α(2→8)-NANA-α(2→3)-Gal-β(1→4)-Glc-ceramide (Fig.1). Several antibodies specific for this antigen have been identified, with one of the most actively investigated being the murine mAb R24. R24 has been shown to prevent tumor development in animal models (11Chapman P.B. Longberg M. Houghton A.N. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1503-1509PubMed Google Scholar), as well as to display anti-tumor activity in human clinical trials (12Vadhan-Raj S. Cordon-Cardo C. Carswell E.A. Mintzer D. Dantis L. Duteau C. Templeton M.A. Oettgen H.F. Old L.J. Houghton A.N. J. Clin. Oncol. 1988; 6: 1636-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Caulfield M.J. Barna B. Murthy S. Tubbs R. Sergi J. Mendendorp S. Bukowski R.M. J. Biol. Response Modif. 1990; 9: 319-328PubMed Google Scholar, 14Raymond J. Kirkwood J. Vlock D. Rabkin M. Day R. Whiteside T. Herberman R. Mascari R. Simon B. Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 1991; 10 (abstr.): 298Google Scholar). One of the most intriguing aspects of R24 is its ability to display homophilic binding through a heavy chain idiotope designated IDHOM(15Chapman P.B. Yuasa H. Houghton A.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar), where homophilic binding is the ability of an antibody to recognize and to bind itself. Homophilic binding is thought to amplify the effective valence of an antibody, and so increase its avidity. R24 has also shown the ability to bind other GD3-specific antibodies in a similar manner (16Yan X. Evans S.V. Kaminski M.J. Gillies S.D. Reisfeld R.A. Houghton A.N. Chapman P.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1582-1588PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the antigen-binding site (designated by idiotope IDGD3) and IDHOM have been shown to be distinct, since specific mutations can disrupt homophilic binding without the loss of antigen binding (16Yan X. Evans S.V. Kaminski M.J. Gillies S.D. Reisfeld R.A. Houghton A.N. Chapman P.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1582-1588PubMed Google Scholar). Homophilic binding in R24 is also distinct from the known ability of murine IgG3 to bind cooperatively to multivalent antigen through an Fc-dependent mechanism (17Greenspan N.S. Monafo W.J. Davie J.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 285-292PubMed Google Scholar), because changes in residue identity in R24 near IDHOM in VH (and thus distant from the Fc) have been shown to disrupt this phenomenon (15Chapman P.B. Yuasa H. Houghton A.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). The avidity of a monoclonal antibody is a critical aspect of its function. Understanding the mechanism of homophilic binding in R24 will have potential impact on engineering this and other mAbs to increase their avidity without altering their specificity. The forms of R24 that are available for study are the original murine R24 mAb, the human-murine chimer chR24, and their respective Fabs. The mAb chR24 is expressed from a construct in which the VL and VH murine genes have been ligated onto the human IgG1(κ) CL and CH genes. This form of R24 was prepared in order to increase its effectiveness as a human therapeutic agent while maintaining its GD3-binding properties. However, preliminary surface plasmon resonance experiments indicated that the homophilic binding properties of chR24 were significantly different from those of the native R24, and a detailed comparison of the homophilic and antigen-binding behavior using several methods was therefore necessary. We present below the characterization of homophilic binding in R24 and chR24 by surface plasmon resonance and x-ray crystal structure analysis. Murine anti-GD3 antibody R24 IgG3(κ) was obtained from hybridoma ascites of (BALB/c × C57BL)F1 mice (11Chapman P.B. Longberg M. Houghton A.N. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1503-1509PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse-human chimeric R24 (chR24) was expressed from a construct consisting of the genes coding for the R24 heavy and light variable region ligated to the respective genes coding for human IgG1(κ) constant domains, and was provided by Dr. Alan Jarvis (Repligen Corp., Cambridge, MA). R24 and chR24 antibodies were purified from ascites using Protein A affinity column chromatography (Bio-Rad). Although ascites does contain immunoglobulins other than R24 or chR24 that will bind to a Protein A affinity column, the purity of the mAb preparations was evident by inspection of isoelectric focussing gels and by the subsequent crystallization of the antigen-binding fragments. Fab fragments were prepared from the purified antibodies by digestion with mercuripapain (Sigma, P-9886). Mercuripapain was activated by β-mercaptoethanol as described previously (18Yamaguchi Y. Kim H. Kato K. Masuda K. Shimada I. Arata Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 181: 259-267Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The mAb digest mixture contained IgG:papain in a 200:1 (w/w) ratio, and carried out in the presence of DTT (8:1 DTT:IgG molar ratio) and brought to final volume with 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.4. The digest reactions were quenched with iodoacetamide equivalent to 2.2 mol of DTT. Time trial results established optimal digests at 3.5 h for R24 and 2.5 h for chR24. Quenched digest mixture was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.4. The dialyzed digest was then filtered on a 0.22-μm low protein-binding filter, and degassed in preparation for high performance liquid chromatography purification (Gilson series 800 HPLC system, Gilson Scientific Canada, Inc.). The Fab fragments were applied to a Shodex IEC-CM825 ion exchange column (Phenomenex) in a mobile phase of 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.4, and eluted against a 0–2 m sodium chloride gradient. Protein content was assayed by absorption at 280 nm wavelength;A 280/1.5 was used to calculate the Fab concentration (in mg/ml). Absorbing fractions were assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Pharmacia Phast System, 12.5% homogeneous gels), to identify the fractions containing Fab, which were pooled and concentrated (Centricon-10, Amicon) to between 8 and 12 mg/ml. Sodium azide was added to the concentrated Fab at 0.02% (w/v). The concentrated Fabs were kept at 4 °C prior to crystallization trials. Primary determination of crystallization conditions for the Fabs from both R24 and chR24 were carried out using Crystal Screen I and II (Hampton Research, Laguna Hills, CA). Screens were carried out by mixing 1 μl of concentrated Fab with 1 μl of reservoir buffer and the resultant drop suspended on a plastic coverslip over 1 ml of reservoir buffer in a Linbro tissue culture 24-well plate (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH). Refinement conditions were generated using reagents from Fluka Biochemika. Data collection was carried out at Queens University (Kingston, Ontario, Canada) using a MAR 30-cm image plate mounted on an Rigaku RU-II generator running at 6 kilowatts. Data reduction was carried out using DENZO (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). Rotation functions were carried out with MERLOT (20Fitzgerald P.M.D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 273-278Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Translation functions and positional refinements were carried out with XPLOR (21Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, Version 3.0. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Molecular modeling and fitting of electron density were carried out with FRODO (22Jones T.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar) and SETOR (23Evans S.V. J. Mol. Graphics. 1993; 11: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). All molecular and electron density diagrams were generated using SETOR and SETORPLOT (23Evans S.V. J. Mol.

Fabs used in the experiments were from the same lot used for crystallization studies. For antigen binding studies, ganglioside GD3 (BioCarb Chemicals) was incorporated into liposomes also containing dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and Salmonella serogroup B lipopolysaccharide as described previously (24MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Lee K.K. Altman E. Young N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5533-5538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Se155-4, an IgG specific for the Salmonella antigen, was immobilized on research grade CM5 sensor chips (Biacore Inc.) and served as a capture molecule for the GD3 liposomes (24MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Lee K.K. Altman E. Young N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5533-5538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Liposomes (1000 RU) were captured followed by injection of murine R24 IgG, chR24 IgG, murine R24 Fab, or chR24 Fab over the liposome surfaces. IgG concentrations were calculated on a per binding site basis. The liposome experiments were carried out in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mmsodium chloride, 3.4 mm EDTA. Control surfaces were prepared in the same way by capturing liposomes containing only dimyristoyl- phosphatidylcholine and lipopolysaccharide. The Se155-4 IgG surfaces were regenerated by sequential injection of 1 and 4 mm sodium taurodeoxycholate in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, and a contact time of 3 s in each instance. For the measurement of homophilic binding under solution-like conditions, murine R24 IgG was immobilized on research grade CM5 sensor chips using the amine coupling kit supplied by the instrument manufacturer. Mouse R24 IgG was then injected over this surface using the phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, buffer employed in Ref. 15Chapman P.B. Yuasa H. Houghton A.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar for the measurement of homophilic binding by ELISA. Primary sensorgram data were evaluated using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software. Small crystals were noted for Crystal Screen I solutions 33, 36, and 45, and the drop sizes were scaled up to 4 and 6 μl and refinements proceeded by varying the pH of the solution along with the concentration and composition of precipitants. Solution 33 (originally 4.0 m sodium formate) yielded crystals after a few weeks with an average size of 0.1 × 0.25 × 0.2 mm3 from a solution at pH 7.5. Solution 36 (originally 8% PEG 8000, Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) yielded crystals in a few days with an average size of 0.15 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm3 from both 8% PEG 8000 in Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 and at pH 8.5, and from 10% PEG 8000 in Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. Solution 45 (originally 18% PEG 8000, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.2 m zinc acetate) yielded crystals with an average size of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.25 mm3 from this solution and from 23% PEG 8000, 0.2 m zinc acetate in 0.1 msodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, from which grew the crystal that gave the highest resolution data. Solution 45 from Crystal Screen I (0.2 m zinc acetate, 0.1 msodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 18% PEG 8000) yielded small crystals after 1 week. Initial refinements were carried out at 4 °C and 20 °C, and consisted of combinations of pH from 6 to 8.5 in increments of 0.5, PEG 4000, 8000, and 10,000, at concentrations of 13, 18, and 23%, with the concentrations of zinc acetate and sodium cacodylate kept constant. The crystal selected for data collection was obtained by macroseeding a drop of 0.2 m zinc acetate and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate at pH 7.0 with 23% PEG 8000. For crystals of the Fab from R24, 58,762 reflections were measured yielding 26,595 unique reflections to 3.1-Å resolution (92% complete) withR sym = 0.075. The Fab was found to crystallize in the monoclinic space group P21 with cell dimensions a = 139.2, b = 82.1,c = 73.6 Å, and β = 94.1°. For crystals of the Fab from chR24, 79,380 reflections were measured yielding 18,143 unique reflections to 2.5-Å resolution (94% complete) withR sym = 0.050. The protein was found to crystallize in the monoclinic space group C2 with cell dimensions a = 146.8, b = 56.0,c = 80.0 Å, and β = 119.2°. The structure of the Fab from murine R24 was solved by molecular replacement methods using the known structure of the Fab from YsT9.1 specific to Brucella abortus as a trial structure (25Rose D.R. Przybylska M. To R.J. Kayden C.S. Oomen R.P. Vorberg E. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1106-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Evans S.V. Rose D.R. To R. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The volume of the unit cell indicated that it probably contained three molecules of R24 Fab per asymmetric unit; however, the rotation solution revealed at best only two clear solutions for the model of the constant domain dimer no matter what combination of resolution range, ς cutoff, and integration radius was used. The best results were found using all data with an input resolution range of 6 to 4 Å and integration radius of 23 Å. The translation solution for the two fragments (including the cross-translation function) was determined with the aid of the Patterson correlation (PC) refinement function in XPLOR. The two variable domain dimers were positioned by executing individual elbow-angle searches using PC refinement about the corresponding constant domain dimers. Several rounds of rigid-body refinement with all data from 6 to 4 Å resolution with I ≥ 3(ς)I were carried out using first the entire Fab as a rigid body, then the intact variable and constant domains, and finally the heavy and light chains of each of the two domains. This resulted in an R-factor of 0.26. The sequence corresponding to R24 was then imposed on the model using SETOR. Hendrickson-Konnert refinements were carried out, alternating with rounds of manual intervention to position the CDRs and other residues. Due to the limited resolution of the data (3.1 Å), all data (i.e. no ς cutoff) was used for the final cycles of refinement, no water molecules were added to the trial structure, and individual temperature factors were not allowed to refine independently. As the nature of the interaction between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit was the object of the analysis, the observed non-crystallographic two-fold symmetry axis was not applied during refinement. The R-factor converged at 0.245 for all data. The final refined overall isotropic temperature factor was 28.4 Å2, which is somewhat lower than the value of 35.3 Å2 obtained from a Wilson plot. AnR free was calculated in a separate refinement to be 0.334, which indicated that the refined model was somewhat underdetermined at 3.1-Å resolution. The structure of the Fab from chR24 was determined using the structure for R24 as a trial structure. A search using XPLOR clearly revealed the orientation and position of the variable domain dimer of chR24 (which has the same sequence as the corresponding domain dimer from R24). An elbow-angle search combined with PC refinement in XPLOR revealed the position of the constant domain dimer. The sequence of the constant domains of both the heavy and light chains were changed to correspond to human IgG1(κ) using SETOR. Refinement proceeded as for R24; however, there were enough data for individual isotropic temperature factors to be refined and for the positions of several water molecules to be assigned. The structure was refined to a final resolution of 2.5 Å, with a final R-factor of 0.162 for all data withI ≥ 2ς(i), with 74 water molecules. The standard deviation of the distribution of the bond lengths and bond angles about ideal values after the final cycles of refinement was found to be 0.022 Å and 3.8°, and 0.015 Å and 1.35° for R24 and chR24, respectively. The Ramachandran plots (not shown) for both structures reveal that few non-glycine residues lie outside the allowed regions. The electron density is well defined over the course of most of the polypeptide chain, even for the 3.1 Å resolution R24 structure. Interestingly, it was the lower resolution R24 structure that was solved first, where the trial phases from the molecular replacement solution were sufficient to trace the entire polypeptide chain. The conformations of all six CDRs in both structures lie in well defined electron density, and the H2 CDR loops from both structures are presented in Fig. 2. The positions of all atoms in the two molecules in the asymmetric unit for R24 were refined independently. Although the R24 Fab crystals scattered to only 3.1 Å resolution, a least-squares superposition of the α-carbon atoms applied separately to the Fv and CH1-CL domain dimers of the two molecules shows no significant difference in the positions of main chain atoms, and small changes in conformation of a few side chains. The “elbow” angles (defined as the angle subtended by the pseudo two-fold axes of the variable and constant domains of an Fab) are not significantly different between R24 and chR24 at 166.7 and 167.3°. A least-squares superposition of the α-carbon atoms of the Fvs of chR24 onto either Fv from R24 gives a root-mean-square deviation of less than 1.0 Å, and shows that the humanization process has had no significant effect on the conformation of the Fv. Surface plasmon resonance experiments showed that both murine R24 IgG and chimeric chR24 IgG bound to GD3-bearing liposome surfaces, but with strikingly different affinities (Fig. 3,a and b). At concentrations of 2 μm, R24 gave a response of 1700 RU at the end of the injection whereas chimeric R24 IgG gave a response of only 35 RU under the same conditions. The most interesting feature of the sensorgrams is the apparent lack of saturation associated with R24 binding to GD3-bearing liposomes. This is characteristic of homophilic binding, and is similar to the results reported previously for the binding of R24 IgG to human melanoma cell lines expressing GD3 (15Chapman P.B. Yuasa H. Houghton A.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). The binding kinetics were observed to be complex at all concentrations of IgG. Distinctly biphasic behavior was evident at higher R24 IgG concentrations of 1 and 2 μm. A “fast-binding” phase is observed to dominate in the first few seconds, accounting for approximately 70% of the bound antibody, followed by a “slow-binding” phase, which gradually increases the amount of bound antibody over a period of several minutes. The rapid initial association may reflect both GD3 antibody recognition and homophilic binding, with the slower association attributable solely to homophilic interactions. The kinetics are simpler at lower concentrations of R24 (Fig. 3 a, inset) where biphasic behavior is not observed; however, even these data do not fit to a simple bivalent analyte model. The data collected at lower IgG concentrations do fit well to a simple one-to-one interaction model, which gives an association rate constant of 1.3 × 105m−1 s−1 and a dissociation rate constant of 2.3 × 10−3 s−1(K D = 18 nm). It was not possible to derive similar rate constants for chR24 because complex biphasic binding is observed at all concentrations (Fig. 3 b). Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data obtained for the binding of murine R24 Fab to liposomes containing 10% GD3 is presented in Fig.4. The plot of bound versusbound/free R24 shows that homophilic binding was occurring, as a straight line with a positive slope indicates that the proportion of available Fab that bound to liposomes increases with increasing Fab concentration. The extent of Fab dimerization resulting from homophilic binding would increase with concentration, and the resulting higher proportion of bivalent Fab would be manifested as increased functional affinity. Equilibrium binding was achieved very rapidly at the Fab concentrations used, and the dissociation of Fab from the liposomes was too rapid to allow the derivation of kinetic constants. These results also agree with reported experiments binding R24 IgG to human melanoma cell lines (15Chapman P.B. Yuasa H. Houghton A.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis of the R24 IgG data did not give a straight line and confirmed the non-saturable nature of analyte binding. It is not surprising that the IgG data was not as easily analyzed as that of the Fab, since bivalency adds complexity to the binding reaction. The affinity of chR24 Fab for GD3-bearing liposomes was significantly weaker than that of the murine Fab. A concentration of 80 μm gave an equilibrium response of 160 RU; this is the same response obtained with murine R24 at a concentration of 6 μm. A Scatchard plot of the equilibrium binding data obtained with chR24 Fab was consistent with non-saturable binding in that a line with a slope of zero was obtained instead of the negative slope expected for a simple one-to-one interaction. By SPR analysis, R24 homophilic binding was only observed in the presence of GD3-bearing liposomes. When R24 IgG was covalently coupled to the dextran matrix of the sensor chips to give IgG surface densities of 12,500 RU, which corresponds to approximately 12.5 ng/mm2, injected R24 IgG at concentrations as high as 1 μm, did not bind to these surfaces, showing that no significant level of homophilic binding occurs in the absence of liposomes containing GD3. This is in contrast to ELISA data, which showed significant binding of biotinylated R24 IgG, over a concentration of 1–100 μg/ml (0.01–1.3 μm), to plates coated with R24 IgG at a concentration of 5 μg/ml (15Chapman P.B. Yuasa H. Houghton A.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). Coating the ELISA plate at this antibody concentration would give an IgG surface density of 3 ng/mm2 if 100% of the antibody adsorbed to the plate. The discrepancy between the ELISA data and the SPR results obtained using immobilized IgG may reflect the fact that IgG would exist under solution-like conditions when linked to dextran chains on sensor chips, whereas adsorption to microtiter plates would present the IgG in a rigid two-dimensional environment more closely resembling cell membrane and liposome surfaces. The chR24 mAb is a chimer, with the Fv domain sharing sequence identity with the Fv from R24, and with the CH1-CL domain dimer corresponding to human IgG1(κ). The chR24 mAb was created in order to preserve the GD3 recognition site while lowering in humans the degre"

In this study, HSact precursor structures have been studied by characterizing [6-3H]GlcN metabolically labeled F9 HS tagged with 3-O-sulfates in vitro by 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phospho-35S and purified 3-O-sulfotransferase-1. This later in vitrolabeling allows the regions of HS destined to become the antithrombin (AT)-binding sites to be tagged for subsequent structural studies. It was shown that six 3-O-sulfation sites exist per HSact precursor chain. At least five out of six 3-O-sulfate-tagged oligosaccharides in HSactprecursors bind AT, whereas none of 3-O-sulfate-tagged oligosaccharides from HSinact precursors bind AT. When treated with low pH nitrous or heparitinase, 3-O-sulfate-tagged HSact and HSinact precursors exhibit clearly different structural features. 3-O-Sulfate-tagged HSacthexasaccharides were AT affinity purified and sequenced by chemical and enzymatic degradations. The 3-O-sulfate-tagged HSact hexasaccharides exhibited the following structures, ΔUA-[6-3H]GlcNAc6S-GlcUA-[6-3H]GlcNS335S±6S-IdceA2S-[6-3H]GlcNS6S. The underlined 6- and 3-O-sulfates constitute the most critical groups for AT binding in view of the fact that the precursor hexasaccharides possess all the elements for AT binding except for the 3-O-sulfate moiety. The presence of five potential AT-binding precursor hexasaccharides in all HSact precursor chains demonstrates for the first time the processive assembly of specific sequence in HS. The difference in structures around potential 3-O-sulfate acceptor sites in HSact and HSinact precursors suggests that these precursors might be generated by different concerted assembly mechanisms in the same cell. This study permits us to understand better the nature of the HS biosynthetic pathway that leads to the generation of specific saccharide sequences.

To synthesize HS oligosaccharide sequences that bind to these specific protein ligands probably requires the synthesis of specific HS precursor structures. HS precursor structures are then acted upon by a unique sulfotransferase, which is positioned at the end of the biosynthetic pathways and whose levels control the concentration of the specific HS component that is the product of the biosynthetic pathway. The pentasaccharide sequence, GlcNAc/NS6S-GlcUA-GlcNS3S6S-IdceA2S-GlcNS6S, represents the minimum sequence for antithrombin (AT) binding, where the boldface 3S and 6S constitute the most critical elements involved in the interaction (8Atha D.H. Stephens A.W. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1030-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 9Atha D.H. Stephens A.W. Rimon A. Rosenberg R.D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The first sugar residue is eitherN-acetylated or N-sulfated. The third sugar residue is either with or without a 6-O-sulfate, depending on the source of heparin from which these sequences were originally characterized (23Loganathan D. Wang H.M. Mallis L.M. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4362-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The AT-binding sequence also exists in HS, but such sequences have never been fully characterized due to limited materials. HSact produced by endothelial cells (1% total HS) is responsible in part for the nonthrombogenic properties of blood vessels (24Marcum J.A. Rosenberg R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 556: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Even though it constitutes a small portion of HStotal, the relative abundance of the AT-binding sequence is at least 10-fold greater than would be predicted by completely random assembly of disaccharide constituents (25Casu B. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1985; 43: 51-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that production of the AT-binding sequence requires the coordinated action of several biosynthetic enzymes, i.e. the enzymes that catalyze chain polymerization, GlcNAcN-deacetylation and N-sulfation, GlcUA epimerization, 2-O-sulfation of uronic acid residues, and 3-O- and 6-O-sulfation of glucosaminyl residues.

Due to the substrate specificity of the enzymes involved, the initial distribution of N-sulfate groups strongly influences the subsequent epimerization and O-sulfations (32Bame K.J. Lidholt K.

However, the mechanisms that control the coordinated action of these enzymes to generate AT-binding sequences or other sequences in HS and heparin are unknown. To delineate the biosynthetic pathway that regulates HSactsynthesis, our laboratory has purified as well as molecularly cloned 3-O-ST-1 (EC 2.8.2.23). It was demonstrated that 3-O-ST-1, existing in limited amount, acts upon HSact precursor to produce HSact and HSinact precursor to produce 3-O-sulfated HSinact (31Shworak N.W. Liu J. Fritze L.M.

Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27072-27082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). When 3-O-ST-1 is no longer limiting in the F9 cell system, the capacity for HSactgeneration is determined by the abundance of HSactprecursors (36Zhang L. Schwartz J.J. Miller J. Liu J. Fritze L.M.S. Shworak N.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27998-28003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have reported that overall HSact and HSinact structures are different at the disaccharide level in the F9 cell system. In vitro 3-O-sulfation with purified 3-O-ST-1 can tag the regions of the HSact precursors destined to become AT-binding sites and allow the HSact precursors to be captured. The tagged regions can then be structurally examined (36Zhang L. Schwartz J.J. Miller J. Liu J. Fritze L.M.S. Shworak N.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27998-28003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on the above observations, we have studied the HSact and HSinact precursor structures by characterizing [6-3H]GlcN metabolically labeled F9 HS tagged with 3-O-sulfates in vitro by PAP35S and purified 3-O-ST-1. We have found that HSact and HSinact precursors in F9 cells have different epimerization and O-sulfation patterns around the 3-O-sulfate acceptor sites in the intact glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain. We have sequenced the 3-O-sulfate-tagged HSact precursor hexasaccharides that represent the 3-O-sulfate acceptor sites in the HSact precursors, which are destined to become AT-binding sites. This region contains five hexasaccharides,i.e.(ΔUA-[6-3H]GlcNAc6S-GlcUA-[6-3H]GlcNS335S±6S-IdceA2S-[6-3H]GlcNS6S)5, which possess the correct positioning of all critical groups except for the absence of the 3-O-sulfate residue required for AT binding in all HSact precursor chains. This finding demonstrates for the first time the overall structure of the HSact precursors. This information permits us to speculate about the nature of the HS biosynthetic pathway that leads to the generation of specific oligosaccharide sequences. F9 cells were grown on gelatin (Sigma) coated (0.1%) tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (Irvine Scientific), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml) under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air and 100% relative humidity. All tissue culture media and reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., unless otherwise indicated. The methods for HS preparation have been described previously (36Zhang L. Schwartz J.J. Miller J. Liu J. Fritze L.M.S. Shworak N.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27998-28003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, cell monolayers were labeled with 100–1000 μCi/ml sodium [35S]sulfate (carrier-free, ICN) overnight by incubation in sulfate-deficient DMEM, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum that had been exhaustively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and supplemented with 200 μm Na2SO4. [6-3H]Glucosamine labeling were conducted in 100 μCi/mld-[6-3H]glucosamine (40 Ci/mmol, ICN) overnight in 1 mm glucose DMEM with 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum. GAGs were isolated from both monolayer and media. Purified GAGs were resuspended in 0.5 m NaBH4in 0.4 m NaOH and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h to release the chains from the core protein. β-Elimination was stopped by adding 5-μl aliquots of 5 m acetic acid until bubble formation ceased. The released GAG chains were purified by DEAE-Sepharose (Sigma) chromatography followed by ethanol precipitation and then resuspended in water. GAGs were digested with 20 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 8.0). Complete digestion of chondroitin sulfate by chondroitinase ABC was ensured by monitoring the extent of conversion of the carrier to disaccharides (100 μg = 1.14 absorbance units at 232 nm). HS was purified from chondroitinase-degraded products by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. After washing the pellets with 0.5 ml of 75% ethanol, HS was suspended in H2O for further analysis. The quality of HS chains prepared was analyzed by anion exchange HPLC (TSK DEAESW, 8 cm × 7.5 mm inner diameter, Tosohaas Inc.). Samples were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2 to 1 mNaCl in 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.0, containing 0.2% CHAPS at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and radioactivity in the effluent was determined by on-line liquid scintillation spectrometry (Packard). The absolute amounts of the unlabeled HS were determined by hydrolyzing HS for 3 h with 6 n HCl and 0.1% phenol (v/v) at 100 °C and determining the levels of glucosamine on an Applied Biosystems model 420 Amino Acid Derivatizer with on-line model 130A PTC amino acid analyzer. The standard 50-μl reaction contains 400 units of purified 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 (3-O-ST-1) (EC 2.8.2.23), 60 μg of bovine serum albumin, metabolically labeled [3H]HS, [35S]HS, or cold HS chains prepared from F9 cells suspended in 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.375 μg/ml protamine, 0.4 mg/ml chondroitin sulfate, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm MES (pH 7.0), and 1 mm PAPS or 25 μm (1 × 108 cpm) PAP35S. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C overnight and then terminated by boiling for 1 min. After adding 100 μg of chondroitin sulfate as cold carrier, the radiolabeled HS was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, and ethanol precipitation. After washing the pellets with 0.5 ml of 75% ethanol, 3-O-sulfate-tagged HSact and HSinactprecursors were separated by AT affinity assay as described below. AT affinity assay was used as described previously (36Zhang L. Schwartz J.J. Miller J. Liu J. Fritze L.M.S. Shworak N.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27998-28003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, AT complexes were created by mixing 3-O-sulfate-tagged HStotal in 500 μl of HB (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4)) with 2.5 mm AT, 100 μg of chondroitin sulfate, 0.002% Triton X-100, 1 mm each of CaCl2, MgCl2, and MnCl2. 60 μl of HB containing ∼50% concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B was then added. AT complexes were bound to concanavalin A by mixing the reaction mixtures for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were pelleted by a brief centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was collected, and the beads were washed three times with 1.25 ml of HB containing 0.0004% Triton X-100. The supernatant and washing solutions were combined as 3-O-sulfate-tagged HSinactprecursors. 3-O-Sulfate-tagged HSact precursors were eluted with three successive 200-μl washes of HB containing 1.0m NaCl, 0.0004% Triton X-100 and pooled. After adding 100 μg of chondroitin sulfate as cold carrier to 3-O-sulfate-tagged HSact precursors, the pooled 3-O-sulfate-tagged HSact and HSinactprecursors were cleaned by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography and ethanol precipitation. After washing the pellets with 0.5 ml of 75% ethanol and dried briefly by Speed-Vac, 3-O-sulfate-tagged HSact and HSinactprecursors were resuspended in H2O and used for chemical and enzymatic structural studies. 3-O-Sulfate-tagged HSact and HSinact precursors or 3-O-sulfate-tagged tetra- or hexasaccharide were mixed with 10 μg of bovine kidney HS (ICN), treated at room temperature with low pH nitrous acid (pH 1.5) for 10 min, and then reduced under alkaline conditions with 0.5 mNaBH4 for another 10 min. Bio-Gel P6 or P2 chromatography as described below was used to analyze further the resultant products. Bio-Gel P2 (0.75 × 200 cm) and P6 (0.75 × 200 cm) columns were equilibrated with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at a flow rate of 4 ml/h. 200 μl of radiolabeled sample mixed with dextran blue (5 μg) and phenol red (5 μg) was loaded on the column. 0.4 ml per fraction was collected. A 10-μl sample from each fraction was counted for 3H and/or35S radioactivity unless otherwise indicated. The desired fractions were pooled and dried by Speed-Vac to remove ammonium bicarbonate and used for further analysis. A small amount of free sulfate generated during the experimental procedures was quantitated by re–running the collected disaccharide fractions on a polyamine HPLC. The free sulfate is subtracted from disaccharides to get the accurate di-, tetra-, and oligosaccharide quantitations indicated under “Results.” Heparitinase I (EC 4.2.2.8), heparitinase II (no EC number), heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7) were obtained from Seikagagu; heparitinase IV was from Dr. Yoshida, Seikagagu Corp., Tokyo, Japan. Heparitinase I recognizes the following sequences: GlcNAc/NS±6S(3S?)-↓GlcUA-GlcNAc/NS±6S. The arrow indicates the cleavage site. Heparitinase II has broad sequence recognition, GlcNAc/NS±6S(3S?)-↓GlcUA/IdceA±2S-GlcNAc/NS±6S. Heparinase and heparitinase IV recognizes the sequences: GlcNAc/NS±3S±6S-↓IdceA2S-GlcNAc/NS±6S. The reaction products and references can be found in the Seikagagu's catalog. The digestion of 3-O-sulfate-tagged HSact and HSinact precursors was carried out in 100 μl of 40 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.0) containing 1 mmCaCl2 with 2 milliunits of enzyme or 2 milliunits of each heparitinase I, heparitinase II, and heparinase. The digestion was incubated at 37 °C overnight unless otherwise indicated. Separation and characterization of 3-O-sulfate-tagged tetra- and hexasaccharides were carried out by HPLC using an amine-bound silica PA01 column (0.46 × 25 cm) (PAMN-HPLC) (YMC). 100-μl aliquots containing 2 nmol of each six known heparan sulfate disaccharide standards (Seikagagu) were included with all analytic runs. The PAMN-HPLC was eluted with H2O for 5 min followed by 0–100% KH2PO4 linear gradient for 100 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The elution of cold disaccharide standards was detected by on-line UV monitoring, and radiolabeled disaccharides were monitored by on-line liquid scintillation spectrometry (Packard Instrument Co.). Each fraction represents a 0.5-ml elution volume. Δ4,5Glycuronidase (no EC number) and Δ4,5glycuronate 2-O-sulfatase (no EC number) were from Dr. Yoshida, Seikagagu Corp., Tokyo, Japan. α-N-Acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfate sulfatase (6-O-sulfatase) (no EC number) and α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (no EC number) were purified from bovine kidney in our laboratory. No other enzymatic activity was detected in these enzyme preparations. GlcUA-[3H]anManR3S and GlcUA-[3H]anManR3S6S standards were prepared as described previously (31Shworak N.W. Liu J. Fritze L.M. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. Logeart D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28008-28019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). GlcUA-anManR335S and GlcUA-anManR335S6S standards were prepared from 3-O-35S-sulfate-tagged cold F9 HS. In brief, after hydrazinolysis, 3-O-35S-sulfate-tagged F9 HS was treated with high pH nitrous acid (pH 4.0) and low pH nitrous acid (pH 1.5). The resultant disaccharides were reduced with NaBH4 and desalted by Bio-Gel P2 chromatography. 3-O-35S-Sulfate-tagged disaccharides were collected by ion pairing reverse phase HPLC as previously reported (37Guo Y.C. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The identity of GlcUA-anManR335S and GlcUA-anManR335S6S was further confirmed by co-chromatography on ion pairing reverse phase HPLC with GlcUA-[3H]anManR3S and GlcUA-[3H]anManR3S6S standards. GlcUA-anManR335S and GlcUA-anManR335S6S are the only disaccharides generated by 3-O-ST-1 and PAP35S tagging of cold F9 HS. 3-O-35S-Sulfate-tagged tetrasaccharides were digested with 10 milliunits of Δ4,5glycuronate 2-O-sulfatase or Δ4,5glycuronidase in a total volume of 100 μl of 50 mm imidazole HCl buffer (pH 6.5) at 37 °C overnight. 5% (5 μl) of the reaction mixture was combined with six HS disaccharide UV standards and GlcUA-[3H]anManR3S6S standard (2000 cpm) in a total volume of 100 μl and analyzed by polyamine HPLC. Completion of the digestion was confirmed by polyamine HPLC. 40 μl of 0.5m sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 55 μl of H2O, and 10 μl 6-O-sulfatase (8 μg) were added to 95 μl of reaction mixture. The 6-O-sulfatase digestion was completed in 2 days at 37 °C as monitored by polyamine HPLC as described above. 100 μl of 6-O-sulfatase-treated materials was diluted with 300 μl of H2O. 2 μl of 16 macetic acid and then 5 μl of α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (3.5 μg) were added (pH 4.2). α-N-Acetylglucosaminidase digestion was completed overnight at 37 °C as monitored by polyamine HPLC. We have previously reported that F9 cells make 1% HSact and 29% HSact precursors, and the metabolically labeled GlcUA-anManR335S (6%) and GlcUA-anManR335S635S (12%) accounted for about 18% of O-sulfated disaccharides in 1% F9 HSact (36Zhang L. Schwartz J.J. Miller J. Liu J. Fritze L.M.S. Shworak N.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27998-28003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The high percentage of 3-O-sulfated disaccharides in the biosynthesized HSact chain suggests that there are multiple potential 3-O-sulfation sites in the F9 HSact precursor chain. To estimate this parameter, [6-3H]GlcN metabolically labeled HSact precursor was isolated by exhaustive conversion to HSact by exposure in vitro to pure 3-O-ST-1 as well as PAPS and subsequent captured by AT affinity chromatography. The 3-O-sulfate-tagged HSact precursors were subjected to a mixture of heparitinase I, heparitinase II, and heparinase treatment. According to a previous publication (38Yamada S. Yoshida K. Sugiura M. Sugahara K. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4780-4787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the combined heparitinase I, heparitinase II, and heparinase digestion should depolymerize all the 3-O-sulfate containing sites into tetrasaccharides and the remaining sugar residues into disaccharides. The depolymerized materials were sized by Bio-Gel P2 chromatography (Fig. 1). 15% of3H counts are resistant to digestion and remained as tetrasaccharides. In contrast, 0.5% of 3H counts are resistant to digestion and remained as tetrasaccharides in [6-3H]GlcN metabolically labeled F9 HS control (data not shown). The di- and tetrasaccharides indicated by solid bar in Fig.1 were collected and subjected to polyamine HPLC chromatography (Fig.2). Each disaccharide peak on HPLC was assigned by comparing to standards (“Experimental Procedures”). The two tetrasaccharide peaks that are resistant to the combined treatment of heparitinase I, heparitinase II, and heparinase digestion are likely to represent the 3-O-sulfate-containing tetrasaccharides. We will subsequently show that the first tetrasaccharide peak has the structure ΔUA-GlcNAc6S-GlcUA-GlcNS3S and the second peak has the structure ΔUA-GlcNAc6S -GlcUA-GlcNS3S6S. The di- and tetrasaccharides from Fig. 2 were further analyzed to estimate the number of 3-O-sulfation sites per HSact precursor chain. We first assessed the molecular weight for F9 HS by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (39Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where M r = 2.112 × protein M-21027. HS exhibits an average molecular weight (M r) of 42,000 (data not shown). Based on this and the average disaccharide molecular mass of 500 Da, there are about 84 disaccharides per chain, i.e. 82 disaccharides in the repetitive -(UA-GlcNAc/S)n- region and one tetrasaccharide GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl- in the linkage region. Assuming the average HS consists of 82 disaccharides in the repetitive -(UA-GlcNAc/S)n- region, the number of di- and tetrasaccharides per 3-O-sulfated HSact precursor chain are summarized in Table I. There are 4 × ΔUA-GlcNAc6S-GlcUA-GlcNS3S and 2 × ΔUA-GlcNAc6S-GlcUA-GlcNS3S6S per chain, therefore a total of six 3-O-sulfate sites per HSact precursor chain.Table IDi- and tetrasaccharide compositions of 3-O-sulfate-tagged HSact precursorsName3-O-Sulfate-tagged [3H]HSact precursorsNo. of sugars/chain1ΔUA-[3H]GlcNAc372ΔUA-[3H]GlcNAc6S53ΔUA-[3H]GlcNS164ΔUA-[3H]GlcNS6S35ΔUA2S-[3H]GlcNS36ΔUA2S-[3H]GlcNS6S6T1ΔUA-[3H]GlcNAc6S-GlcUA-[3H]GlcNS3S4T2ΔUA-[3H]GlcNAc6S-GlcUA-[3H]GlcNS3S6S2Number of disaccharides per chain82Number of NS per chain34Number of 2S per chain9Number of 3S per chain6Number of 6S per chain22Number of total sulfates per chain71In vitro 3-O-sulfated [3H]HSactprecursors were depolymerized with a mixture of heparitinase I, heparitinase II, and heparinase. The resulting unsaturated di- and tetrasaccharides were originally separated on a Bio-Gel P2 column (Fig.1) and were then further resolved by polyamine HPLC (Fig. 2). The number of each di- and tetrasaccharide per chain was determined in two steps. Initially, we determined the radioactivity per di- or tetrasaccharide. To this end, the sum of radioactivity in all di- and tetrasaccharide peaks was divided by 82 to determine the average radioactivity per disaccharide and 41 to determine the average radioactivity per t"

Three general classes of covalent modification have been documented (i.e. N-acylation, isoprenylation, and thioacylation) (reviewed in Ref. 1Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Fatty acids, depending on their length, are linked to proteins by one of two bonds; long chain fatty acids (e.g. palmitate) are esterified to cysteines (i.e. thio-palmitoylation) in varying positions along the polypeptide (see Refs. 2Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar and 3Ross E.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 107-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar for reviews). (On occasion, long chain fatty acids occur in amide linkage to lysine (4Hackett M. Guo L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Science. 1994; 266: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).) On the contrary, shorter chain fatty acids (e.g. myristate) have been found exclusively in amide linkage to N-terminal glycine (N-acylation) (5Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Bryant M.L. Gordon J.I. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 405-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), is a protozoan parasite, which in the bloodstream of a mammal is covered with about 107molecules of a variant surface glycoprotein (VSG),1 a GPI-anchored molecule. A 39-kDa GPI-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) that can cleave diacylglycerol from VSG and GPI biosynthetic intermediates is expressed in bloodstream form T. brucei (6Hereld D. Krakow J.L.

The parasite contains approximately 4 × 104 molecules of GPI-PLC per cell (6Hereld D. Krakow J.L. Bangs J.D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13813-13819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), about one enzyme molecule per 250 molecules of VSG. With a turnover number (k cat) of 144 min−1 (9Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), there appears to be sufficient enzyme intracellularly to cleave all of the VSGs within a few minutes. However, cleavage of VSG in living T. brucei is not a major catabolic pathway, although purified GPI-PLC cleaves VSG efficientlyin vitro (9Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These observations suggest, among other possibilities, that (i) GPI-PLC may not have access to VSG in a living cell and/or (ii) GPI-PLC is not enzymatically active in vivo. GPI-PLC has been immunolocalized to the cytoplasmic leaflet of intracellular vesicles (10Bülow R. Griffiths G. Webster P. Stierhof Y.-D. Opperdoes F.R. Overath P. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 233-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), apparently sequestered, topologically, from VSG which is attached to the outer (exoplasmic) leaflet of the plasma membrane. Such localization studies support the former hypothesis, although the latter cannot be ruled out completely. Biosynthesis of GPIs is initiated on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (11Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), implying that GPI intermediates probably co-localize with GPI-PLC on the cytoplasmic side of cellular membranes in T. brucei. This assertion is supported by two studies involving the stable transfection of a cDNA encoding T. brucei GPI-PLC into the related protozoan parasitesLeishmania major and Trypanosoma cruzi. First,L. major expressing GPI-PLC acquires a GPI-negative phenotype resulting apparently from cleavage of protein-GPI intermediates by the enzyme (12Mensa-Wilmot K. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P. Al-Qahtani A. McGwire B.S. Tucker S. Morris J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Second, in T. cruziGPI-PLC causes a GPI deficiency that is associated with failure of the parasites to sustain division of the cell nucleus (13Garg N. Tarleton R.L. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12482-12491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Given these observations, it is imperative to examine why GPI-PLC in its native environment (i.e. in T. brucei) does not cause a GPI deficiency. As part of efforts aimed at unraveling the mechanisms that regulate activity of GPI-PLC in T. brucei, we investigated the possibility that the enzyme, itself an integral membrane protein, had a lipid modification. Herein, we demonstrate that GPI-PLC is covalently modified with myristic acid in a thioester linkage. The observation is the first example of acylation of a GPI-PLC in vivo. The esterified fatty acids modulated activity of this PLC, proving that phospholipases may be regulated by covalently attached lipids. T. brucei ILTat 1.3 was harvested from the blood of infected rats by cardiac puncture. Buffy coats were prepared and parasites purified by DE52 chromatography (14Cross G.A.M.

Entensify and EN3HANCE were from DuPont; MeltiLex was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and Uniplate RPS-F silica gel (20 × 20 cm) was from Analtech (Newark, DE). Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was from Life Technologies, Inc., and DE52 was from Whatman (Hillsboro, OR). p-Nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloroindolyl phosphate were purchased from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were from Sigma. A pellet of 2 × 109 purified T. brucei was resuspended in 20 ml of pre-warmed labeling media (RPMI 1640 containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Metabolic labeling was initiated by addition of 400 μCi of [9,10-3H]myristic acid (51.0 Ci/mmol) or [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (60 Ci/mmol) or [11,12-3H]lauric acid (60 Ci/mmol) complexed with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (1 mg) in 40 μl of PBS (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, harvested by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min, and washed by resuspension in fresh labeling medium and re-centrifugation. Parasites (7 × 109) were labeled with [9,10-3H]myristate (1.4 mCi). The cells were washed and resuspended in 14 ml of fresh labeling medium and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Two-ml aliquots (109 cells) were harvested every 10 min, washed with PBS, and frozen at −80 °C until use. After metabolic labeling of 109 cells with 200 μCi of [9,10-3H]myristate, the parasites were washed, resuspended in 5 ml of fresh labeling medium containing 1.4 mm cycloheximide, and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then harvested, washed with PBS, and frozen at −80 °C until use. In another set of experiments, 109 cells were pretreated with 1.4 mm cycloheximide in labeling medium for 15 min at 37 °C prior to addition of 200 μCi of a [9,10-3H]myristate-bovine serum albumin complex. Labeling was continued for 1 h. Control cells were labeled with [9,10-3H]myristate for 1 h, washed, and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Parasites were washed with PBS and the resulting pellets stored at −80 °C until use. Cells (109) were resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (PIC). (PIC consisted of leupeptin (2.1 μm),N-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (0.1 mm), antipain dihydrochloride (20 nm), 4-amidinophenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (20 nm), aprotinin (0.4 units), EDTA (140 μm), and phosphoramidon (20 nm).) Cells were held on ice for 20 min, after which the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g (4 °C) for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. This lysis step was repeated. A membranous pellet, from the second lysis step (above), was resuspended in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.2 m NaCl, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm EDTA, 10 units/ml aprotinin, and PIC). The lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min. One microliter of mc2A6-6 ascites fluid was added to the detergent-solubilized pellet, which was incubated (4 °C) with continuous inversion for 2 h. To get rid of membrane-associated VSG, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C and the pellet discarded. To the supernatant, 50 μl of a suspension (1:1) of protein A-Sepharose:water was added followed by incubation at 4 °C with repeated inversion for 18 h. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 s, and the supernatants were discarded. Recovered beads were washed as follows: once with 1 ml of PBS; twice, each time with 750 μl of buffer KGKOG (3.17 m potassium glutamate, 0.59 m KCl, and 0.1% (w/v) n-octyl glucoside); twice, 1 ml each, with PBS containing 2% Nonidet P-40 (15Mensa-Wilmot K. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The beads received a final wash in 1 ml of PBS. Protease inhibitors were added to all buffers before the washes, performed by repeated inversion on a laboratory rotator at 4 °C for 10 min. Beads were recovered in between washes by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 s. To help recovery of the protein A-Sepharose beads after washing with KGKOG, 750 μl of deionized water was added, to reduce the viscosity of the solution prior to the centrifugation step. For some studies, an estimate of the total amount of3H-acylated VSG was needed. For this purpose, a 10-μl aliquot of the detergent-solubilized pellet (107 cell eq) was withdrawn (i.e. prior to immunoprecipitation of GPI-PLC) and added to 10 μl of 2.5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (25% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% (v/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). Following a 5-min heating step at 90 °C, a profile of total acylated proteins (mainly VSG) was obtained after SDS-PAGE fluorography (Figs. 2 and6).Figure 6Acyl-GPI-PLC is active. A, T. brucei (109) were metabolically labeled with [3H]myristate and lysed hypotonically. Cell lysates were processed as illustrated. B, a membranous pellet of a lysate from [3H]myristate-labeled cells was resuspended in lysis buffer and incubated for 15 min either at 4 °C (lanes 1–4) or 37 °C (lanes 5–8). In some experiments, Nonidet P-40 was added to 1% (final concentration) before incubation (lanes 3, 4, 7, and8). Lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7depict immunoprecipitates of GPI-PLC (from 5 × 108cell eq), and lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8contain 107 cell eq of total proteins. SDS-PAGE (14% minigel) was used to resolve the proteins, which were then detected by fluorography. The dried gel was exposed to HyperfilmTM(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 5 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunoadsorbed 3H-acylated GPI-PLC (approximately 50 μl) was eluted by heating the protein A-Sepharose-antibody complex in 25 μl of a modified 2.5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. A SDS-PAGE buffer lacking Tris was used. We found that presence of Tris base in SDS-PAGE sample buffer deacylated GPI-PLC when heat (90 °C, 5 min) was applied. Eluted samples were centrifuged for 3 min at 14,000 ×g (room temperature). A 20-μl aliquot of the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (14% minigel) (Bio-Rad). The gel was soaked in Entensify (DuPont), dried, and exposed to pre-flashed Hyperfilm-MP at −80 °C. Alternatively, proteins were transferred to Immobilon P with a Trans-Blot semi-dry cell (Bio-Rad). It was operated for 2 h at 20 V at 25 °C and 0.5 A in 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, pH 9.2, containing 1.3 mm SDS. The Immobilon P membrane was coated with molten MeltiLex wax, air-dried, and exposed to pre-flashed Hyperfilm-MP at −80 °C. The Immobilon P membrane was first soaked in blocking solution (1% (v/v) Tween 20, 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum, 13% (w/v) glycerol, 18% (w/v) d-glucose in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. This was followed by 1 h incubation in blocking solution containing a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against GPI-PLC polypeptide (R18B3), at a 1:3000 dilution. The membrane was then washed three times (10 min each) with PBS followed by incubation for another hour with 1:1000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The PBS wash was repeated. The membrane was then washed twice (10 min each) in alkaline phosphatase reaction buffer (75 mm NaCl, 75 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.5, and 3.8 mm MgCl2). Antigens were visualized in alkaline phosphatase reaction buffer, using 5-bromo-4-chloroindolyl phosphate and p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride as substrates. Immunoadsorbed3H-acylated GPI-PLC or proteins from [3H]myristate-labeled T. brucei were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P. The membrane was soaked in 200 ml of one of the following solutions: 1 mNH2OH (adjusted to pH 7 with 10 n NaOH); 0.2m KOH; and 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7. Each solution was incubated at 30 °C with shaking. These solutions were replaced three times (every 30 min), after which the membranes were incubated overnight in 200 ml of the same solution. The membranes were air-dried, coated with MeltiLex wax, and radiolabeled proteins detected by fluorography. Immunopurified [3H]GPI-PLC was electrophoresed on an SDS-PAGE. Gel slices containing the radiolabeled polypeptide were excised, sliced, and placed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube (approximate volume of gel was 400 μl). After rinsing with 1 ml of deionized water, [3H]GPI-PLC was deacylated in situ with 1 ml of neutral hydroxylamine by incubation at 30 °C. At 20-h intervals, the gel suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was withdrawn. The incubation and centrifugation steps were repeated five more times, and the supernatants were pooled and dried in vacuo. Released3H-fatty acids were identified as described below. A complex of3H-acylated GPI-PLC (from 4 × 109 cells) adsorbed to monoclonal antibody 2A6-6, which was in turn bound to protein A-Sepharose (in 100 μl), was resuspended in 250 μl of 1m NH2OH, pH 7.0. The suspension was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min with shaking, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 min, and withdrawal of the supernatant. Two more hydroxylamine treatments were performed. Eluates were pooled, and 54 μl of concentrated HCl added, to acidify the solution. [3H]mfVSG was deacylated to provide cell-derived [3H]myristate as a control in the TLC analysis. Approximately 300,000 dpm of purified protein was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with 900 μl of 0.2 m KOH, and the solution was acidified with 20 μl of concentrated HCl. 3H-Fatty acids released from both [3H]GPI-PLC and [3H]mfVSG were recovered into hexane by three extractions, each with 500 μl of the solvent. The hexane phases for each sample were pooled, back-extracted twice with 700 μl of 10 mm HCl, and dried under nitrogen gas. Methyl ester derivatives of the fatty acids were generated by resuspending the dried fatty acids in 200 μl of BF3-methanol (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) and heating for 2 min at 100 °C. Two hundred μl of 5 m NaCl, 0.5 m acetic acid was added, and the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES) extracted three times, each time with 200 μl of toluene. Toluene extracts were combined, dried under nitrogen gas, and resuspended in 10 μl of the solvent. Then, radioactivity in a 2-μl portion was quantitated in a liquid scintillation counter and the remaining 8 μl analyzed by reverse phase-high performance thin layer chromatography (RP-HPTLC) (see below). Radiolabeled FAMES were detected by fluorography. Uniplate RPS-F silica gel (20 × 20 cm) were used with chloroform:methanol:water (15:45:3, v/v/v) as the mobile phase (16Heise N. Cardoso de Almeida M.L. Ferguson M.A.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The developed HPTLC plate was air-dried, sprayed with EN3HANCE, and FAMES detected by fluorography. Standard FAMES of [3H]laurate, [3H]myristate, [3H]palmitate, and [3H]stearate were prepared from the corresponding free fatty acids as described above. GPI-PLC (from 2 × 1010 cells of a hypotonic lysate of T. brucei) was adsorbed to monoclonal antibody 2A6-6 (mc2A6-6) and washed as described above. The immunoadsorbent was incubated in 5 ml of 1 m neutral hydroxylamine at 30 °C for 40 min with shaking. One-ml aliquots (approximately 2 μg of GPI-PLC) were withdrawn after 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min. Recovered beads were washed three times in 3 ml of PBS. GPI-PLC was eluted from the column with 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 12, containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, into an equal volume of chilled (0 °C) 1 mTris-HCl, pH 6.0, containing 1.0% Nonidet P-40 to neutralize the elution buffer. Enzyme activity in the eluate was assayed as follows. A reaction mixture containing 2 μg of [3H]myristate-labeled VSG in 25 μl of AB (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) was assembled on ice (in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube). To this mixture, several dilutions (in AB) of the eluate from the mc2A6-6·protein A-Sepharose column was added (the objective being to obtain values within the linear range of the assay (9Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). This reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by vortex mixing with 500 μl of water-saturated n-butanol (at room temperature). Phases were separated by centrifugation (12,000 ×g, 1 min, 25 °C), and enzyme activity was quantified by measuring the amount of [3H]dimyristoylglycerol released into the upper butanol phase (9Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To obtain GPI-PLC for kinetic analysis, the immunoadsorption protocol was modified to reduce contamination of the purified enzyme with antibody leaching from the monoclonal antibody column. GPI-PLC (from 2.5 × 109 parasites) was adsorbed to a 100-μl suspension of mc2A6-6 that had been chemically cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose (9Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The complex was treated with 1 m neutral hydroxylamine or PBS (see above, “Deacylation of Native3H-Acylated GPI-PLC and 3H-Myristoylated mfVSG”) for 40 min. GPI-PLC was eluted from the immune complex as described above. Amount of GPI-PLC that cleaved approximately 20% of [3H]myristate-labeled VSG was determined empirically and used in the kinetic analysis. Reaction mixtures were assembled on ice as described above with the exception that the AB buffer contained 0.1% Nonidet P-40. VSG cleavage was allowed to proceed for 15 min. Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to determine the Michaelis constant (K m) (Table I). VSG was assumed to be a dimer in the calculation of substrate concentration. For purposes of determining the turnover number (k cat), protein concentration of eluates from the mc2A6-6 column was determined by quantitative Western blots using known amounts of purified recombinant GPI-PLC as standards.Table IKinetic properties of acylated and de-acylated GPI-PLCEnzymeK mk catExp. 1Exp. 2Exp. 1Exp. 2μmmin−1Acylated GPI-PLC2.72.611881636De-acylated GPI-PLC1.72.03989 Open table in a new tab Metabolic labeling of T. brucei with [3H]myristate (C14), [3H]palmitate (C16), or [3H]laurate (C12) led to incorporation of radiolabel into GPI-PLC detected after SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). This observation suggested that a fatty acid might be covalently bound to GPI-PLC. Lipids are covalently attached to proteins by one of three general mechanisms as follows: (i) through an amide bond (e.g. N-acylation), (ii) by esterification, as in S-palmitoylation; or (iii) in an ether linkage (e.g. S-isoprenylation). To define the link between the acyl group and GPI-PLC, attempts were made at deacylation after electrotransfer of purified 3H-acylated GPI-PLC to Immobilon P membrane. Reagents tested were 0.2 mKOH (pH ∼13), which cleaves both oxyesters and thioesters, 1m NH2OH, pH 7 (neutral hydroxylamine), which can specifically cleave thioesters (17Bizzozero O.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7, a control. Cleavage (by de-O-myristoylation) of a GPI anchor (on VSG) was studied as a control for the effectiveness and specificity of these reagents. Neutral Tris-HCl failed to deacylate either VSG (Fig.2, lane 1) or GPI-PLC (Fig. 2,lane 2). Hydroxylamine, on the other hand, deacylated GPI-PLC (Fig. 2, lane 6) but did not deacylate VSG (Fig. 2,lane 5). These observations indicate that the acyl moiety on GPI-PLC is present in a thioester link. Consistent with the specificity of hydroxylamine the oxy-esterified [3H]myristate on VSG was left intact, apparently. KOH deacylated GPI-PLC (Fig. 2, lane 4) confirming that the fatty acid was indeed esterified to GPI-PLC. VSG was deacylated with KOH (Fig. 2, lane 3). In another control experiment, neutral hydroxylamine did not release [3H]myristate from purified [3H]myristate-labeled VSG in aqueous solution (data not presented). Metabolic labeling of GPI-PLC with three fatty acids (i.e.[9,10-3H]palmitate (C16), [9,10-3H]myristate (C14), and [11,12-3H]laurate (C12)) (Fig. 1) raised the possibility that the enzyme was heterogeneously acylated. To address this issue, the fatty acid on GPI-PLC was characterized. Cells were metabolically labeled with [9,10-3H]myristate; GPI-PLC was immunoadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose and deacylated with neutral hydroxylamine. Methyl esters of the released fatty acids were generated and analyzed by reversed phase-high performance thin layer chromatography (RP-HPTLC)/fluorography (Fig.3, lane 2). Using fatty acid methyl ester standards (Fig. 3, lane 1), myristic and palmitic acids were detected (Fig. 3, lane 2). The ratio of the myristate:palmitate was 3:1, as determined by laser scanning densitometry of the fluorographs. When the parasites were metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitate, myristate and palmitate were detected on GPI-PLC, although the efficiency of labeling the enzyme was reduced significantly (data not presented). Together these data suggest that T. brucei metabolizes fatty acids before their incorporation into GPI-PLC. Because this report is the first in the literature of myristate in a thioester bond to an enzyme, a second approach was adopted to check whether the assignment of one of the fatty acids on GPI-PLC as myristic acid was in error. For this purpose, purified VSG was deacylated with KOH, and the released fatty acid was converted to the methyl ester and compared with the FAMES from lipids of GPI-PLC. The VSG fatty acids were correctly identified as myristic acid (Fig. 3, lane 3) (18Ferguson M.A.J. Low M.G. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14547-14555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, the VSG fatty acid comigrated with the myristate from GPI-PLC (Fig. 3, lane 2). Thus, the assignment of the faster migrating fatty acid species in the GPI-PLC sample as myristate is not an artifact caused by spurious migration of a longer chain fatty acid on the HPTLC plate. To investigate the temporal order of GPI-PLC acylation with regard to protein synthesis, cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of T. brucei protein synthesis, was used in experiments in which metabolic labeling with [3H]myristate was attempted before or after addition of CHX. When the trypanosomes were labeled with [3H]myristate prior to CHX treatment (CHX-II), the inhibitor appeared to have no effect on acylation of GPI-PLC within that time frame studied (Fig.4 A, compare lane 1 to lane 3). However, if the parasites were treated with cycloheximide (CHX-I) prior to addition of [3H]myristate, acylation of GPI-PLC was inhibited partially (Fig. 4 A, lane 2), compared with the control (Fig.4 A, lane 1). Approximately 50% of the lipid modification on GPI-PLC (as estimated by laser scanning densitometry of fluorographs) occurs in the absence of new protein synthesis. We infer that 50% of the acylation occurred on nascent GPI-PLC, possibly on ribosomes. These observations indicate that acylation of GPI-PLC occurs both co-translationally and post-translationally. In control experiments, the effect of CHX on the GPI-PLC polypeptide backbone was studied in [35S]methionine-labeled T. brucei (Fig. 4 B). Here, CHX blocked synthesis of the enzyme if pre-incubated with the cells (Fig. 4 B, lane 2), but no effect on GPI-PLC was apparent when added after metabolic labeling (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). These observations confirm our previous conclusion that a significant proportion of theS-acylation of GPI-PLC occurs post-translationally. When a gel identical to that depicted in Fig. 4 A was analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-GPI-PLC antibody, similar amounts of GPI-PLC were detected in all three lanes (Fig. 4 C). We conclude that loss of 3H-lipid (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) was due to a decrease in fatty acid addition instead of protein degradation. To investigate whether myristate or palmitate was preferentially added to GPI-PLC post-translationally, trypanosomes were pretreated with CHX (CHX-I) prior to metabolic labeling with [3H]myristate. [3H]Acyl-GPI-PLC was immunoadsorbed and deacylated (see “Experimental Procedures”). The released fatty acid(s) were analyzed by RP-HPTLC/fluorography (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 5). Both myristate and palmitate were added to GPI-PLC post-translationally, but myristate addition dropped about 50% (Fig. 5, compare lanes 2 and3). The ratio of myristate:palmitate (recovered from GPI-PLC) decreased to 2:1 (i.e. from 3:1). As compared with the control lane (Fig. 5, lane 2), the amount of palmitate added post-translationally to GPI-PLC did not change. Apparently, most of the post-translational acylation of GPI-PLC is due to myristate incorporation. These experiments also ruled out the possibility that the palmitate and myristate detected on GPI-PLC when the enzyme was adsorbed to a mc2A6-6·protein A-Sepharose column (Fig. 3) originated from contaminating phospholipid or VSG. Since immunopurified [3H]GPI-PLC isolated from polyacrylamide gel slices contained [3H]palmitate and [3H]myristate (Fig. 5 , lane 2), it is clear that both fatty acids are covalently attached to GPI-PLC. The ratio of [3H]myristate:[3H]palmitate on GPI-PLC was again 3:1, as determined by laser scanning densitometry of fluorographs from the HPTLC plates. Lipid modification has a potential for regulating the activity of GPI-PLC. For example, acylation of the protein could inactivate the enzymatic activity. Alternatively, deacylation might then be required to impart catalytic activity to the polypeptide. These ideas were tested as described below. GPI-PLC cleaves the [3H]myristate-labeled GPI of VSG during hypotonic lysis of T. brucei, releasing the radioactive lipid as di-[3H]myristoylglycerol (19Rolin S. Hanocq-Quertier J.

To understand the molecular basis for the complex antigenic profile of RhD protein, we expressed a series of RhD fusion proteins using different portions of Duffy protein as a tag in erythroleukemic K562 cells. Because the reactivity of monoclonal anti-RhD antibody, LOR15C9, depends mainly on the sequence coded by exon 7 of RhD, we altered DNA sequence corresponding to the amino acid residues 323–331(A) and 350–354(B) in the exon 7. The mutation in region B resulted in a severe reduction in LOR15C9 binding by flow cytometry analysis, suggesting that region B may play an important role in constituting antigen epitopes recognized by LOR15C9. On the other hand, a slight decrease in the antibody binding was observed for the region A mutant, suggesting that the intracellularly located region A may elicit a long distance effect on the formation of exofacial antigen epitopes.

Therefore, it appears that all three of these molecules belong to a family of structurally related membrane proteins.The multiprotein complex provides the basis for enormously complicated D antigenic epitopes, which have been serologically classified into nine epitopes, epD1 to epD9 (7Lomas C. McColl K. Tippett P. Transfus. Med. 1993; 3: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Most of the information regarding the molecular basis for D epitopes has been derived from genetic analysis of RhD variants where part of the RhD gene is missing or replaced by the highly homologous RhCE sequence (2Huang C.-H. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1997; 4: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, DVIphenotype, characterized as lack of epD1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8, contains rearranged RHD gene where its exons 4–6 are replaced withRHCE equivalents (8Mouro I. Le Van K.C. Rouillac C. van Rhenen D.J. LePennec P.Y. Bailly P. Cartron J.-P. Blood. 1994; 83: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In DIVa phenotype that lacks epD 1, 2, 3, and 9, there is a rearrangement of exon 3 and part of exon 7 of the RHD gene (9Rouillac C. Colin Y. Hughes-Jones N.C. Boelet M. D'Ambrosio A.M. Cartron J.-P. Le Van Kim C. Blood. 1995; 85: 2937-2944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that serologically defined D epitopes are organized into overlapping motifs. A similar notion was deduced from the analysis of phage-displayed anti-RhD antibodies (10Chang T.Y. Siegel D.L. Blood. 1998; 91: 3066-3078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).With the expression of Rh30 on the surface of K562 cells (11Smythe J.S. Avent N.D. Judson P.A. Parson S.F. Martin P.G. Anstee D.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 2968-2973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is now possible to elucidate the molecular basis for the D epitopes using the approach of molecular biology. However, it has been reported (12Suyama K. Lunn R. Haller S. Goldstein J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that K562 cells express endogenous RhD protein, as detected by reverse transcription-PCR1 and surface binding of anti-RhD. On the other hand, the attempts to express RhD on the surface of nonerythroid cells, which do not produce endogenous RhD protein, have met little success (13Hermand P. Mouro I. Huet M. Bloy C. Suyama K. Goldstein J. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. Blood. 1993; 82: 669-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Suyama K. Roy S. Lunn R. Goldstein J. Blood. 1993; 82: 1006-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that multiple proteins are required during RhD synthesis for the formation of the RhD complex on the cell surface recognized by specific antibodies. Therefore, to express a high level of RhD protein, which is biochemically distinguishable from its endogenous counterpart in K562 cells and useful in the study of the molecular basis for D epitopes, we expressed RhD as a fusion protein attaching part of Duffy protein (Fy) to the N terminus of RhD. Here, we present the data about the surface expression of RhD fusion proteins in K562 cells and the comparison of its antigenic profile with that of its endogenous counterpart in K562 cells and mature erythrocytes. Furthermore, this expression system was used in determining the amino acid residues involved in the binding of the monoclonal anti-RhD, LOR15C9 (15Apoil P.A. Reid M.E. Halverson G. Mouro I. Colin Y. Roubinet F. Cartron J.-P. Blancher A. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 98: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONOur objective was to design a RhD fusion protein that can be detected with antibodies against both RhD and the fused tag in flow cytometry analysis and be easily distinguishable in size from endogenous RhD on SDS-PAGE. Because the RhD molecule contains 12-transmembrane domains with both termini facing cytoplasma, the fusion of a simple tag such as hexahistidine at either end would not provide a marker detectable on the cell surface. Therefore, we explored the possibility of using a type I transmembrane protein in the construction of RhD fusion proteins. Fy protein, a blood group antigen and a promiscuous chemokine receptor, has been expressed on the surface of K562 cells that does not have detectable background (18Chaudhuri A. Zbrzezna V. Polyakova J. Pogo A.O. Hesselgesser J. Horuk R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7835-7838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chaudhuri A. Polyakova J. Zbrzezna V. Williams K. Gulati S. Pogo A.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10793-10797Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The extracellularly located N-terminal domain (64 residues) of the protein is recognized by anti-Fy6. Furthermore, the antibody binding site has been mapped to the region between residues 9–44 of Fy protein (21Chitnis C.E. Chaudhuri A. Horuk R. Pogo A.O. Miller L.H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1531-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of these features, we constructed three plasmids expressing RhD fusion proteins, DD1, DD2, and DD3 (Fig. 1). To maintain the proposed membrane topology of RhD proteins, the full-length or first 97 amino acids (the N-terminal extracellular and first transmembrane domain) of Fy was conjugated to the N terminus of RhD protein in the cases of DD1 and DD2. Furthermore, to examine whether the transmembrane domain (66–86 amino acids) of Fy is required for membrane localization of DD2 and proper presentation of Fy6 and RhD antigens, DD3 fusion protein was constructed. The N-terminal 32 amino acids of RhD containing the first transmembrane domain was also removed in the DD3 construct to maintain the proper conformation of RhD protein in the cell membrane. In addition, two amino acid residues, Thr-Ser, were engineered in the junction of Fy and RhD to provide the necessary flexibility of the polypeptide to eliminate any possible steric hindrance of neighboring domains recognized by antibodies. The same strategy was used by Nunoki et al. (22Nunoki K. Ishii K. Okada H. Yamagishi T. Murakoshi H. Taira N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24138-24142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in constructing hybrid potassium channels.The data derived from flow cytometric and confocal microscope analyses indicate that fusion proteins DD2 and DD3 are expressed on the K562 cell surface in conformations that are recognized by LOR15C9 and anti-Fy6. This underscored the notion that these two fusion proteins have the membrane topology as projected in Fig. 1. The expression of these two fusion proteins was further confirmed by the immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in Fig. 6, both proteins migrated to approximately the same position on SDS-PAGE, although the calculated molecular mass of DD2 is approximately 7 kDa more than that of DD3. This may be due to the fact that Rh protein, which constituted mostly of DD2 and DD3, is known to migrate in SDS gel anomalously (23Avent N.D. Liu W. Warner K.M. Mawby W.J. Jones J.W. Ridgwell K. Tanner M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14233-14239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On the other hand, although the expression of DD1 (80 kDa) was confirmed as shown in Figs. 6 and 7, its presence on the cell surface was not definitely identified by flow cytometric analysis. Because DD1 is composed of 19 transmembrane domains (Fig. 1) based on the model for Fy and RhD proteins, the fusion protein may be simply too big to be transported to the cell surface.As an important molecule in the Rh complex, Rh50 is endogenously produced in K562 cell line and migrates as a protein of 32 kDa on SDS-PAGE presumably due to incomplete glycosylation. 2A. Zhu and K. Suyama, unpublished data. However, the extent to which the Rh50 glycoprotein is required for the expression of RhD and D epitope formation on the surface of K562 cells has yet to be elucidated. In our immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 6, lanes 2–4), although no band around 32 kDa is visible, the possibility that Rh50 was coprecipitated with RhD fusion proteins could not be excluded. Compared with overexpressed fusion proteins, endogenous Rh50, as well as endogenous RhD, could be simply too low in quantity to be detected under experiment conditions. Nevertheless, RhD fusion proteins with different molecular masses may prove useful in the study of interactions between Rh50 and RhD.Smythe et al. (11Smythe J.S. Avent N.D. Judson P.A. Parson S.F. Martin P.G. Anstee D.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 2968-2973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported the expression of RhD and RhcE gene products by retroviral transduction of K562 cells. Their data provide the first direct evidence that the putative RhD gene gives rise to D and G antigens and that the putative RhcE gene gives rise to c and E antigens. They concluded that retroviral delivery of the gene was of critical importance in achieving expression of Rh antigens on K562 cells. Based on their conditions, anti-RhD bound more strongly to the RhD-expressing K562 cells than to the control cells, with an increase in MFI from 3.3 to 15.2, whereas the level of endogenous Rh antigen in the untransduced K562 cells was minuscule (from 2.8 to 3.8). On the other hand, based on our data, we were able to clearly demonstrate not only endogenous RhD in K562 cells (increase in MFI from 7.44 to 26.29) but also exogenous RhD expressed on the cell surface (increase in MFI from 26.29 to 143.61). Our data suggest that successful expression and detection of RhD protein on the K562 cell surface may have resulted from optimized fluorescence-activated cell sorter conditions with a highly specific and purified antibody, as well as an efficient transfection system.Because the DD2 molecule contains the full-length RhD and the junction between RhD and the Fy tag is intracellularly located, DD2 is more likely than DD3 to retain the native D antigenic profile. In addition, although RhD was also expressed under the same conditions, we believed that the DD2 molecule would be preferable in the study of the molecular basis for RhD antigenic epitopes. This is because the Fy portion at the N terminus of DD2 can serve as a tag for confirming the cell surface expression, regardless of any changes made in the RhD portion of the fusion protein. Our mutagenesis study indicated that the binding of LOR15C9 was adversely affected by both mutations, DD2A and DD2B, with the latter being more severe. It is interesting to note that according to the proposed membrane topology of RhD protein, region B is located at the sixth extracellular loop of RhD, whereas region A is near the intracellular end of a transmembrane domain. Thus, our data suggest that region B may be directly involved in the binding with LOR15C9, whereas mutations in region A may elicit a long distance effect on antibody binding on the cell surface. In other words, the substitution of region A in RhD with corresponding RhCE sequence may transform an exofacial D epitope into “CE-like” conformation. Monoclonal antibody LOR15C9 has been well characterized by Apoil et al.(15Apoil P.A. Reid M.E. Halverson G. Mouro I. Colin Y. Roubinet F. Cartron J.-P. Blancher A. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 98: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Their data indicate that the antibody recognizes not only RhD molecule on the cell surface in flow cytometry analysis but also the denatured proteins by immunoblotting. Our observations that both mutations (A and B) decreased but did not abolish the binding of LOR15C9 as determined by flow cytometry further support the notion that the binding of LOR15C9 depends on conformation as well as sequence of the antigen within RhD protein.Our analysis of the RhD antigenic profile of K562 cells suggests subtle changes in the conformation or microenvironment of RhD (both endogenous and exogenous) on the K562 cell surface in comparison with its counterpart on red blood cells. Specifically, the epD2 and 4 recognized by LOR11-12E2 and LOR17-6C7, respectively, may have been somehow affected by K562 cells. The lack of activity for LOR-12E2 was further confirmed by a related antibody, LOR-12E2-1C6 (data not shown). Although Mag 1–123 may possibly have an overlapping epD specificity with LOR11-12E2, there is evidence suggesting that these two reagents are serologically distinctive (24Scott M. Transfus. Clin. Biol. 1996; 3: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, we tested four different monoclonal reagents with the same specificity (epD6 and 7). As expected, they all reacted positively with expressed DD2, as well as with endogenous RhD on the K562 cell surface. The information generated from such antigenic profile analysis will be important in designing approaches and interpreting data to determine the molecular basis for RhD antigenic epitopes using K562 cells as an expression host. As one of the most important blood group systems involved in blood transfusion and hemolytic disease, the Rh antigens are present on the erythrocyte surface as a complex including Rh30 proteins (RhD and RhCE) and Rh50 glycoprotein (see recent reviews in Refs. 1Blancher A.

J. Cell Biol. 1992; 267: 5569-5574Google Scholar) first demonstrated that the Rh polypeptides migrated through sucrose gradients as a complex with an apparentM r of 170,000. Based on proteolytic digestion and immunoblotting, Eyers et al. (4Eyers S. Ridgwell K. Mawby W.J. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed a model that consists of two of each Rh30 and Rh50 molecules, with their N-terminal portions forming the core of the complex. The genes encoding RhD and RhCE are located at chromosome 1p34-p36 (5Cherif-Zahar B. Mattei G. LeVan K.C. Bailly P. Cartron J.-P. Colin Y. Hum. Genet. 1991; 86: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), whereas RH50gene is at chromosome 6p11–21 (6Ridgwell K. Spurr N.K. Laguda B. Maggeoch C. Avent N.D. Tanner M.J.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).

Med. 1996; 184: 1531-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of these features, we constructed three plasmids expressing RhD fusion proteins, DD1, DD2, and DD3 (Fig. 1). To maintain the proposed membrane topology of RhD proteins, the full-length or first 97 amino acids (the N-terminal extracellular and first transmembrane domain) of Fy was conjugated to the N terminus of RhD protein in the cases of DD1 and DD2. Furthermore, to examine whether the transmembrane domain (66–86 amino acids) of Fy is required for membrane localization of DD2 and proper presentation of Fy6 and RhD antigens, DD3 fusion protein was constructed. The N-terminal 32 amino acids of RhD containing the first transmembrane domain was also removed in the DD3 construct to maintain the proper conformation of RhD protein in the cell membrane. In addition, two amino acid residues, Thr-Ser, were engineered in the junction of Fy and RhD to provide the necessary flexibility of the polypeptide to eliminate any possible steric hindrance of neighboring domains recognized by antibodies. The same strategy was used by Nunoki et al. (22Nunoki K. Ishii K. Okada H. Yamagishi T. Murakoshi H. Taira N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24138-24142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in constructing hybrid potassium channels. The data derived from flow cytometric and confocal microscope analyses indicate that fusion proteins DD2 and DD3 are expressed on the K562 cell surface in conformations that are recognized by LOR15C9 and anti-Fy6. This underscored the notion that these two fusion proteins have the membrane topology as projected in Fig. 1. The expression of these two fusion proteins was further confirmed by the immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in Fig. 6, both proteins migrated to approximately the same position on SDS-PAGE, although the calculated molecular mass of DD2 is approximately 7 kDa more than that of DD3. This may be due to the fact that Rh protein, which constituted mostly of DD2 and DD3, is known to migrate in SDS gel anomalously (23Avent N.D. Liu W. Warner K.M. Mawby W.J. Jones J.W. Ridgwell K. Tanner M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14233-14239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On the other hand, although the expression of DD1 (80 kDa) was confirmed as shown in Figs. 6 and 7, its presence on the cell surface was not definitely identified by flow cytometric analysis. Because DD1 is composed of 19 transmembrane domains (Fig. 1) based on the model for Fy and RhD proteins, the fusion protein may be simply too big to be transported to the cell surface. As an important molecule in the Rh complex, Rh50 is endogenously produced in K562 cell line and migrates as a protein of 32 kDa on SDS-PAGE presumably due to incomplete glycosylation. 2A. Zhu and K. Suyama, unpublished data. However, the extent to which the Rh50 glycoprotein is required for the expression of RhD and D epitope formation on the surface of K562 cells has yet to be elucidated. In our immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 6, lanes 2–4), although no band around 32 kDa is visible, the possibility that Rh50 was coprecipitated with RhD fusion proteins could not be excluded. Compared with overexpressed fusion proteins, endogenous Rh50, as well as endogenous RhD, could be simply too low in quantity to be detected under experiment conditions. Nevertheless, RhD fusion proteins with different molecular masses may prove useful in the study of interactions between Rh50 and RhD. Smythe et al. (11Smythe J.S. Avent N.D. Judson P.A. Parson S.F. Martin P.G. Anstee D.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 2968-2973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported the expression of RhD and RhcE gene products by retroviral transduction of K562 cells. Their data provide the first direct evidence that the putative RhD gene gives rise to D and G antigens and that the putative RhcE gene gives rise to c and E antigens. They concluded that retroviral delivery of the gene was of critical importance in achieving expression of Rh antigens on K562 cells. Based on their conditions, anti-RhD bound more strongly to the RhD-expressing K562 cells than to the control cells, with an increase in MFI from 3.3 to 15.2, whereas the level of endogenous Rh antigen in the untransduced K562 cells was minuscule (from 2.8 to 3.8). On the other hand, based on our data, we were able to clearly demonstrate not only endogenous RhD in K562 cells (increase in MFI from 7.44 to 26.29) but also exogenous RhD expressed on the cell surface (increase in MFI from 26.29 to 143.61). Our data suggest that successful expression and detection of RhD protein on the K562 cell surface may have resulted from optimized fluorescence-activated cell sorter conditions with a highly specific and purified antibody, as well as an efficient transfection system. Because the DD2 molecule contains the full-length RhD and the junction between RhD and the Fy tag is intracellularly located, DD2 is more likely than DD3 to retain the native D antigenic profile. In addition, although RhD was also expressed under the same conditions, we believed that the DD2 molecule would be preferable in the study of the molecular basis for RhD antigenic epitopes. This is because the Fy portion at the N terminus of DD2 can serve as a tag for confirming the cell surface expression, regardless of any changes made in the RhD portion of the fusion protein. Our mutagenesis study indicated that the binding of LOR15C9 was adversely affected by both mutations, DD2A and DD2B, with the latter being more severe. It is interesting to note that according to the proposed membrane topology of RhD protein, region B is located at the sixth extracellular loop of RhD, whereas region A is near the intracellular end of a transmembrane domain. Thus, our data suggest that region B may be directly involved in the binding with LOR15C9, whereas mutations in region A may elicit a long distance effect on antibody binding on the cell surface. In other words, the substitution of region A in RhD with corresponding RhCE sequence may transform an exofacial D epitope into “CE-like” conformation. Monoclonal antibody LOR15C9 has been well characterized by Apoil et al.(15Apoil P.A. Reid M.E. Halverson G. Mouro I. Colin Y. Roubinet F. Cartron J.-P. Blancher A. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 98: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Their data indicate that the antibody recognizes not only RhD molecule on the cell surface in flow cytometry analysis but also the denatured proteins by immunoblotting. Our observations that both mutations (A and B) decreased but did not abolish the binding of LOR15C9 as determined by flow cytometry further support the notion that the binding of LOR15C9 depends on conformation as well as sequence of the antigen within RhD protein. Our analysis of the RhD antigenic profile of K562 cells suggests subtle changes in the conformation or microenvironment of RhD (both endogenous and exogenous) on the K562 cell surface in comparison with its counterpart on red blood cells. Specifically, the epD2 and 4 recognized by LOR11-12E2 and LOR17-6C7, respectively, may have been somehow affected by K562 cells. The lack of activity for LOR-12E2 was further confirmed by a related antibody, LOR-12E2-1C6 (data not shown). Although Mag 1–123 may possibly have an overlapping epD specificity with LOR11-12E2, there is evidence suggesting that these two reagents are serologically distinctive (24Scott M. Transfus. Clin. Biol. 1996; 3: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, we tested four different monoclonal reagents with the same specificity (epD6 and 7). As expected, they all reacted positively with expressed DD2, as well as with endogenous RhD on the K562 cell surface. The information generated from such antigenic profile analysis will be important in designing approaches and interpreting data to determine the molecular basis for RhD antigenic epitopes using K562 cells as an expression host.

To functionally and biochemically characterize this interaction, we purified a soluble form of duck carboxypeptidase D from a baculovirus expression system, confirmed its receptor function, and investigated the contribution of different preS sequence elements to receptor binding by surface plasmon resonance analysis. We found that preS binds duck carboxypeptidase D with a 1:1 stoichiometry, thereby inducing conformational changes but not oligomerization. The association constant of the complex was determined to be 2.2 × 107m−1 at 37 °C, pH 7.4, with an association rate of 4.0 × 104m−1 s−1 and a dissociation rate of 1.9 × 10−3 s−1, substantiating high affinity interaction of avihepadnaviruses with their receptor carboxypeptidase D. The separately expressed receptor-binding domain, comprising about 50% of preS as defined by mutational analysis, exhibits similar constants. The domain consists of an essential element, probably responsible for the initial receptor contact and a part that contributes to complex stabilization in a conformation sensitive manner.

Seeger C. Current Top. Microbiol. Immunol. Springer-Verlag KG, Berlin1991: 168Google Scholar). In case of the human hepatitis B virus (HBV)1chronic infections dramatically increases the risk for the development of primary hepatocellular carcinomas, and HBV therefore represents a major health problem to the world population (2Hildt E. Hofschneider P.H. Urban S. Semin. Virol. 1996; 7: 333-347Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). While many details of hepadnaviral genome replication are understood in considerable detail (reviewed in Refs. 3Nassal M. Schaller H. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 221-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar and 4Nassal M. Schaller H. J. Viral Hepatitis. 1996; 3: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), our knowledge of the early events in HBV infection, namely the identity of the cellular receptor for HBV, is poor, and reflects the lack of a suitable infection system (5DeMeyer S. Gong J.Z. Suwandhi W. van Pelt J. Soumillion A. Yap S.H. J. Viral Hepatitis. 1997; 4: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, promising results have been achieved in the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) model system where systematic infection studies using primary duck hepatocytes can reproducibly be performed (6Tuttleman J.S. Pugh J.C. Summers J.W. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 17-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this system infections can be suppressed by the simultaneous application of nucleocapsid-free, non-infectious subviral particles which are produced in an about 1000-fold excess over virus during infection (7Klingmüller U. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7414-7422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both subviral particles and virions contain the same two envelope proteins, namely the large viral surface protein (L-protein) and the small viral surface protein (S-protein). Both proteins are transcribed from a common open reading frame and share the hydrophobic S moiety which is responsible for membrane anchoring. The L-protein additionally contains the 161-amino acid amino-terminal hydrophilic preS sequence which, on its own, inhibits the DHBV infection of primary duck hepatocytes. A subsequent deletion analysis showed that an 85-amino acid preS element constitutes the receptor-binding domain within preS (8Urban S. Breiner K.M. Fehler F. Klingmüller U. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8089-8097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify receptor candidates for DHBV, Kuroki et al. (9Kuroki K. Cheung R. Marion P.L. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2091-2096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and independently Tong et al. (10Tong S. Li J. Wands J.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7106-7112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified a glycoprotein of 170–180 kDa (gp180/p170) which binds DHBV particles and Escherichia coli-derived GST-preS polypeptides. Sequence comparisons of gp180/p170 cDNA with known sequences suggested that it represents the prototype of a new family of membrane bound carboxypeptidases (10Tong S. Li J. Wands J.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7106-7112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kuroki K. Eng F. Ishikawa T. Turck C. Harada F. Ganem D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15022-15028Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Independently, several mammalian homologues of gp180/p170 were discovered in bovine, rat, mouse, and humans, and have been classified as metallocarboxypeptidase D (CPD) (12Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13Xin X. Varlamov O. Day R. Dong W.J. Bridgett M.M. Leiter E.H. Fricker L.D.

Life Sci. 1997; 60: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Tan F. Rehli M. Krause S.W. Skidgel R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The primary sequence analyses indicate that CPDs consist of three luminal/extracellular carboxypeptidase B-like domains (called A, B, and C), a hydrophobic transmembrane anchor and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail. While in the A and B domains all essential amino acids for the enzymatic activity of CPDs investigated so far are conserved, the C domains lost most of them, despite their high overall sequence homology. It has therefore been hypothesized that this domain of CPD is catalytically inactive and serves a different, as yet unknown function (15Tan F. Rehli M. Krause S.W. Skidgel R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This assumption was recently confirmed for duck CPD, whose A and B domains displayed CPD activity, while the C-domain contains the DHBV preS-binding site (16Eng F.J. Novikova E.G. Kuroki K. Ganem D. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8382-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CPDs from rat and duck have been shown to be residenttrans-Golgi network membrane proteins which cycle between the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane (17Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 877-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Breiner K.M. Urban S. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8098-8104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their localization, enzymatic activity, and the broad tissue distribution support the notion that CPDs are involved in processing of a variety of polypeptides that traverse the secretory pathway of various tissues (19Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28884-28889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, evolutionary conservation of an enzymatically inactive C-domain, recycling from the cell surface to thetrans-Golgi network, and the uptake of DHBV particles strongly implies a yet unidentified function of CPDs, possibly involving binding of a natural ligand. We have recently characterized the receptor-binding domain within the preS region of the DHBV L-protein and demonstrated that duck carboxypeptidase D is the primary receptor for avian hepatitis B viruses (8Urban S. Breiner K.M. Fehler F. Klingmüller U. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8089-8097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Breiner K.M. Urban S. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8098-8104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have extended these results by the detailed biochemical analysis of the DHBV preS-duck carboxypeptidase D interaction. Using a set of preS deletion mutants, we investigated binding and dissociation rates of the preS·receptor complex by real time surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. We defined a receptor-binding domain, comprising about one-half of preS, which consists of a short receptor attachment site and a conformation dependent stabilizing element. Binding of dCPD to this domain is strong and, considering the presence of multiple binding sites in viral particles, implies that DHBV binding to hepatocytes is probably irreversible. Together with findings from earlier studies our results allow a model to be proposed for the early steps in hepadnaviral infection with several implication regarding the mechanisms of hepadnaviral infection. The baculovirus transfer vector pVL-sdCPD was constructed by ligating the NcoI/XhoI fragment of plasmid pBKRSV-gp180 (kindly provided by K. Kuroki, Kanasawa, Japan) into a modified version of plasmid pVL1393 (Fig. 1 A). This vector contains an additional NcoI site as a part of the start codon and a polylinker at the 3′ end which introduces an artificial stop codon. The NcoI/XhoI fragment of pBKRSV-gp180 encodes the signal sequence of duck CPD and the three carboxypeptidase-like domains but lacks the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane anchor and the cytosolic tail. Recombinant baculoviruses were obtained by co-lipofection ofSpodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells with a mixture of 100 ng of linearized Baculo-Gold DNA (Pharmingen) and 5 μg of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL-sdCPD using the manufacturer's protocol for lipofection with DOTAP (Boehringer-Mannheim). Two hours after lipofection, the medium was changed and recombinant viruses were collected after 5 days. The virus was purified according to the protocol of O′Reilly et al. (20O'Reilly D. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar), amplified inSf9 cells by two additional rounds of infection and used for infection of High Five cells as described below. Protein samples for SDS-PAGE were dissolved in sample buffer (200 mm Tris/Cl, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 0.1 mg/ml Orange G), boiled for 5 min, and subjected to electrophoresis in 7.5 or 13% polyacrylamide-SDS gels (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were either silver-stained according to the method described by Heukeshoven and Dernick (22Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) or transferred to a nitrocellulose filter for immunological analysis. As a primary antibody we used 1:5000 dilutions of a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against a recombinant polypeptide of the COOH-terminal third of dCPD (kindly provided by K. Breiner). As a secondary antibody we used a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Dianova). Detection was done by enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL, Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 4-Amino-benzoyl-arginine (PABA) was synthesized by a combination of the methods described by Hitchcock and Smith (23Hitchcock M. Smith J.N. Biochem. J. 1964; 93: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and Plummer and Hurwitz (24Plummer Jr., T.H. Hurwitz M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3907-3912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product was recrystallized and its structure verified by 3H,13C NMR, and mass spectrometry. Coupling of PABA to activated CH-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) was performed according to the suppliers standard protocol. 5.4 × 107 High Five insect cells (three T175 flasks), grown in 100 ml of Express Five serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) were infected with 9 ml of culture supernatant of AcNPV-sdCPD infected Sf9 cells (multiplicity of infection = 100). Cells were incubated at 27 °C for 72 h to allow protein expression. The culture supernatant was centrifuged (5000 × g, 15 min) to remove cells, passed through a 0.22-μm nitrocellulose filter, adjusted to pH 5.5 with acetic acid and applied to a 4-amino-benzoyl-arginine-Sepharose column (15-ml bed volume, flow rate of 0.5 ml/min) equilibrated with 20 mm NaAc, 1m NaCl, pH 5.5. Due to the absence of the transmembrane domain, detergent was not required during purification. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C on a FPLC system (Pharmacia). After extensive washing (15 bed volumes), the buffer was changed to 10 mm NaAc, pH 5.5 (5 bed volumes), and sdCPD was eluted with 50 mml-arginine in 20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0. Protein containing fractions were dialyzed against 25 mm NaPi, pH 7.0, and concentrated to a final volume of 2–4 ml using a Centriplus 30 concentrator (Amicon). Concentration was determined by measuring the extinction at 280 nm as described by Gill and von Hippel (25Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) based on the molar extinction coefficient of 159,400 calculated from the primary sequence using the program Protean (Lasergene). Primary duck hepatocytes were prepared and cultivated as described previously (26Rigg R.J. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2829-2836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For infection, competition assays 8 × 105 cells were cultivated for 3–8 days in 12-well plates, and infected with 4 × 107 DNA-containing DHBV particles (determined by DNA dot blot) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of sdCPD. To this aim DHBV-containing duck serum was mixed with appropriate stock solutions of sdCPD, completed to a final volume of 500 μl with maintenance medium, and applied to a 12-well plate of primary duck hepatocytes. After infection for 14 h at 37 °C, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured for 6 additional days. Intracellular viral DNA was prepared, using the QIAamp blood kit (Qiagen) and subjected to DNA dot-blot analysis as described by Rigg and Schaller (26Rigg R.J. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2829-2836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphoImager. Isolation of monomeric sdCPD and determination of apparent molecular weights of proteins and protein complexes were achieved by exclusion chromatography on a calibrated Superdex 200 column (1.6 × 60 cm; Pharmacia), connected to a FPLC system (Pharmacia) and equilibrated in 5% sucrose, 150 mmNaCl, 25 mm NaPi, pH 7.0. All chromatographic steps were performed at 4 °C with a flow rate of 2.2 ml/min. Sample volumes were 0.5 ml for analytical and up to 2 ml for preparative purposes. Eluted proteins were collected in fractions of 2.2 ml, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by silver staining or immunoblotting. The column was calibrated with thyroglobulin (670 kDa), fraction 12; γ-globulin (158 kDa), fraction 16; ovalbumin (44 kDa), fraction 20; myoglobin (17 kDa), fraction 23 and vitamin B-12 (1.3 kDa), fraction 28. PreS polypeptides were prepared as described previously (8Urban S. Breiner K.M. Fehler F. Klingmüller U. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8089-8097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and covalently immobilized on covalink immunoplates (Nunc) via COOH groups by NHS/EDC activation chemistry. Each well consisted of 15–30 μg of preS polypeptide in 100 μl of 25 mm NaPi, pH 6.3, and were mixed with 50 μl ofN-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (3.48 mg/ml in aqua bidest.) and 50 μl of EDC (3.07 mg/ml in aqua bidest.). Coupling was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. To remove uncoupled polypeptide, plates were washed 3 times with 300 μl of water and 3 times with 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween 20. After blocking with 200 μl of 2% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, CPD containing protein samples were added in either standard binding buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris/Cl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for solubilized membrane fractions or detergent-free binding buffer (50 mm Tris/Cl, 150 mm NaCl) for recombinant soluble dCPD. Binding assays at different pH values were performed in sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.5–5.5, sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0–8.0, and Tris buffer, pH 8.5–10.0. Binding was allowed to occur for at least 4 h at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were removed and the plate was washed 3 times with binding buffer at 4 °C. Bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer at 80 °C and analyzed by PAGE and Western blotting. Surface plasmon resonance analysis (BIAcore-Upgrade, BIAcore-System) of DHBV preS protein binding to sdCPD was done at 37 °C in 1 × HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Surfactant P-20 (Pharmacia)) at flow rates of 5–30 μl/min according to standard protocols provided by the manufacturer. DHBV preS proteins were coupled to a CM5 sensor chip via standard NHS/EDC activation chemistry (BIAcore amine coupling kit) in amounts that yielded 2,200–3,500 response units. Monomeric and oligomeric sdCPD at the indicated concentrations were injected for 5 min followed by 3 min elution with HBS buffer. The sensor chip was cleaned of sdCPD bound to immobilized DpreS by injection of 30 μl of regeneration solution (20 mm HCl). Binding constants of the sdCPD-DpreS interaction were calculated with the BIAevaluation program version 2.1 (Pharmacia). The baselines for the curves shown in Fig. 4 were adjusted to zero before calculation. Calculation of K d was done by fitting the data to the equation R =R 0e −K d(t−t 0). To facilitate biochemical studies on the interaction of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) with duck carboxypeptidase D (dCPD), we constructed recombinant baculoviruses that encode the three extracellular carboxypeptidase-like domains of dCPD and the amino-terminal export signal but lack the COOH-terminal transmembrane anchor and the highly conserved cytoplasmic tail (Fig.1 A). Recombinant baculoviruses were amplified in S. frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cells and used for infection of the High Five insect cell line (see “Experimental Procedures”). Omission of the transmembrane anchor and the cytoplasmic part resulted, as intended, in the secretion of a soluble dCPD variant of 170 kDa (sdCPD), as shown by Western blot analysis of culture supernatants using an antiserum against gp180 (Fig.1 B). Treatment with endoglycosidases H and F led to a decrease of the molecular weight indicating that sdCPD had been modified by both complex and high mannose-type glycosylation (Fig.1 B). Purification of sdCPD from the culture supernatant of infected High Five cells was achieved by affinity chromatography on a PABA-Sepharose column (Fig. 1 C) as described previously (12Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Silver staining of proteins from pooled fractions eluting from the PABA column revealed a single band at about 170 kDa with only minor contaminants. Western blot analysis using an anti-dCPD specific antibody verified the identity of the 170 kDa as dCPD (Fig. 1 D) as does analysis by Edman degradation. The NH2-terminal sequence AHIKKAEAA … indicated cleavage of the leader sequence at position 25 in insect cells, and was found to be identical to previously published data for endogenous duck CPD (11Kuroki K. Eng F. Ishikawa T. Turck C. Harada F. Ganem D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15022-15028Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and bovine CPD (19Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28884-28889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, detection of a second sequence KAEAA … , lacking 4 amino acids, suggests that processing can also occur after lysine 28 in insect cells. The comparison of the yields of recombinant sdCPD obtained from Sf9 cells with the yields obtained from High Five cells revealed an about 8-fold higher expression rate in the High Five cell line (25 μg of sdCPD per 107 Sf9 cells in contrast to 200 μg/107 High Five cells). Further analysis of affinity purified sdCPD on a calibrated Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Fig.2 A) resulted in two forms with different apparent molecular weights, which were, however, indistinguishable in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B) and Western blot analysis (data not shown). About 35% of sdCPD eluted in the void volume and represent oligomers with molecular masses of approximately 3,600 kDa as determined by electron microscopy (data not shown). 65% of sdCPD eluted at 248 kDa and represents monomeric sdCPD eluting at a slightly higher molecular mass than expected. Since proteins were initially purified by affinity chromatography on PABA-Sepharose it can be assumed that both forms have carboxypeptidase activity but differ considerably in their binding properties to DHBV preS, as shown below. To investigate whether recombinant sdCPD exhibits receptor function comparable to the cell surface bound molecule on hepatocytes, we performed infection inhibition assays essentially as described previously for DHBV preS (DpreS) polypeptides (8Urban S. Breiner K.M. Fehler F. Klingmüller U. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8089-8097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary duck hepatocytes were infected with DHBV in the presence of increasing amounts of monomeric or oligomeric sdCPD, and viral markers (intracellular viral DNA or secreted DHBV e-antigen) were quantified 6 days post-infection. As shown in Fig.3 A, both forms of sdCPD efficiently inhibit DHBV infection. About 7 molecules of monomeric sdCPD per viral particle were sufficient for 50% inhibition of infection (18Breiner K.M. Urban S. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8098-8104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison, oligomeric sdCPD, despite its inability to bind recombinant DHBV preS, as shown below, competed DHBV infection also remarkably well; with about 15 molecules needed for 50% inhibition. In these calculations we assumed that an approximately 1,000-fold excess of non-infective subviral particles is present in the infective serum. Taking into account that one particle consists of approximately 20 L-protein molecules with 50% having an inverse topology and therefore their receptor-binding domain is located inside the viral particle (27Swameye I. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9434-9441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that every single sdCPD molecule is able to bind viral particles. Ratios of 100 sdCPD molecules/particle almost completely block DHBV infection, indicating that viral particles bound to sdCPD are unable to infect hepatocytes. Insect cell-derived soluble duck carboxypeptidase D therefore constitutes a suitable tool for virus-receptor interaction studies at the molecular level. Competitive inhibition of infection was also performed with theE. coli-derived preS polypeptides used in the binding studies described below. As shown in Fig. 3 B, full-length DpreS and the DHBV preS fragment DpreS30–115, representing the receptor-binding domain, inhibit DHBV infection equally well in a concentration-dependent manner. Under the conditions used, the IC50 was determined to be 0.4–0.8 μm, corresponding to approximately 3000 DpreS molecules per viral particle. To confirm that the biological activity of sdCPD in infection competition experiments correlates with its physical binding properties to DHBV preS polypeptides, we performed binding assays with the solid phase bound preS polypeptides depicted in Fig.4 A and compared the results with those obtained for authentic dCPD from duck liver lysates. As shown in Fig. 4 B, authentic dCPD binds DpreS and the DpreS fragment consisting of amino acids 30–115 (DpreS30–115). The deletion mutant DpreSΔ85–96, inactive in DHBV infection competition (8Urban S. Breiner K.M. Fehler F. Klingmüller U. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8089-8097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a control and showed no binding. Likewise, recombinant sdCPD eluted from the PABA column binds DpreS but not DpreSΔ85–96 (Fig.4 C). However, even at a large excess of DpreS we did not observe complete binding of sdCPD (Fig. 4 C, left frame, left lane) and therefore assumed that a fraction of sdCPD might be inactive in DpreS binding. This interpretation was confirmed in a quantitative BIAcore analysis showing that oligomeric sdCPD does not bind DpreS (see below). In Fig. 5 the pH dependence of the DpreS-sdCPD interaction is shown. Binding was observed between pH 5.5 and 10.0 with an optimum at pH 6.5. Binding still occurred at pH 5.0. However, further protonation abolished binding completely. To determine association and dissociation rates of the DHBV preS·sdCPD complex and accordingly deduce the affinity of DHBV to its cellular receptor we followed complex formation and dissociation by real time surface plasmon resonance analysis (BIAcore). DHBV preS polypeptides were covalently immobilized to CM5 sensor chips (see “Experimental Procedures”) and three different concentrations (0.06, 0.15, and 0.29 μm) of monomeric sdCPD were injected onto the surface at 37 °C (Fig. 6 A). The kinetics of binding (100–400 s) and release (400–575 s) of sdCPD were calculated from the slopes of the curves. The association ratek a was determined to 4.0 × 104m−1 s−1, the dissociation ratek d to 1.9 × 10−3s−1, corresponding to a half-life for the complex of about 6.0 min at 37 °C. From these data we calculated the dissociation constant K d to 4.6 × 10−8m. Using the DHBV preS fragment from amino acid 30 to 115 (DpreS30–115), which has been identified by infection competition experiments as the receptor-binding domain (8Urban S. Breiner K.M. Fehler F. Klingmüller U. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8089-8097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed similar constants: k a, 7.1 × 104m−1 s−1; k d, 2.7 × 10−3 s−1;t 12, 4.3 min; K d, 3.8 × 10−8m (Fig. 6 B). Consequently full-length DpreS and DpreS30–115 are indistinguishable in both infection competition and dCPD interaction. Consistent with our observation in the qualitative binding assay (Fig.4 B), the deletion mutant DpreSΔ85–96 showed no obvious interaction with sdCPD in the BIAcore experiment (Fig. 6 D). This observation led us to conclude that amino acid residues 85–96 of DpreS contain absolutely essential elements for receptor interaction. Interestingly, anti-preS antibodies which are capable of blocking DHBV infection have been mapped to bind epitopes within this region 2C. Kuhn, personal communication., 3L. Cova, personal communication.indicating their surface exposure. Despite its ability to bind the substrate PABA, most likely via the two enzymatically active A and B domains, oligomeric sdCPD was found to interact only weakly with DpreS (Fig. 6 C). Thus oligomerization restricts DpreS binding. We extended surface plasmon resonance analysis to investigate the contribution of particular sequence elements within DpreS to receptor binding, by testing the same set of deletion mutants (Fig.7 A) that have been characterized in infection competition experiments (8Urban S. Breiner K.M. Fehler F. Klingmüller U. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8089-8097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for sdCPD interaction (Fig. 7, B-D). Deletions outside the receptor-binding domain (mutants DpreSΔ22–30 and DpreSΔ128–139) showed kinetics of association and dissociation similar to full-length DpreS (Fig. 7 B). This indicates that the part of preS that binds the receptor folds independently of the deleted flanking amino acids and constitutes a distinct domain within the viral L-protein. In contrast, DpreSΔ85–96 and deletion mutant DpreSΔ101–109 were completely impaired in sdCPD binding (Fig. 7 D). This region of preS (amino acids 85–109) therefore contains elements which are absolutely required for receptor interaction. An intermediate phenotype was found for deletion mutants DpreSΔ67–70 and DpreSΔ74–84. They were able to interact with sdCPD but displayed drastically diminished binding and dissociation rates (Fig. 7 D). This was confirmed using the terminal deletion mutants depicted in Fig. 7 C. While DpreS30–115 binds sdCPD as strongly as full-length DpreS, mutants with successive deletions beyond amino acid 30 (DpreS38–115, DpreS43–115, and DpreS52–130) were"
