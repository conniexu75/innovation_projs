https://openalex.org/W4311664742,"Atmospheric methane growth reached an exceptionally high rate of 15.1 ± 0.4 parts per billion per year in 2020 despite a probable decrease in anthropogenic methane emissions during COVID-19 lockdowns1. Here we quantify changes in methane sources and in its atmospheric sink in 2020 compared with 2019. We find that, globally, total anthropogenic emissions decreased by 1.2 ± 0.1 teragrams of methane per year (Tg CH4 yr-1), fire emissions decreased by 6.5 ± 0.1 Tg CH4 yr-1 and wetland emissions increased by 6.0 ± 2.3 Tg CH4 yr-1. Tropospheric OH concentration decreased by 1.6 ± 0.2 per cent relative to 2019, mainly as a result of lower anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and associated lower free tropospheric ozone during pandemic lockdowns2. From atmospheric inversions, we also infer that global net emissions increased by 6.9 ± 2.1 Tg CH4 yr-1 in 2020 relative to 2019, and global methane removal from reaction with OH decreased by 7.5 ± 0.8 Tg CH4 yr-1. Therefore, we attribute the methane growth rate anomaly in 2020 relative to 2019 to lower OH sink (53 ± 10 per cent) and higher natural emissions (47 ± 16 per cent), mostly from wetlands. In line with previous findings3,4, our results imply that wetland methane emissions are sensitive to a warmer and wetter climate and could act as a positive feedback mechanism in the future. Our study also suggests that nitrogen oxide emission trends need to be taken into account when implementing the global anthropogenic methane emissions reduction pledge5."

https://openalex.org/W4311667375,"Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor devices hold great promise for realizing topological quantum computing with Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, multiple claims of Majorana detection, based on either tunneling or Coulomb blockade (CB) spectroscopy, remain disputed. Here we devise an experimental protocol that allows to perform both types of measurements on the same hybrid island by adjusting its charging energy via tunable junctions to the normal leads. This method reduces ambiguities of Majorana detections by checking the consistency between CB spectroscopy and zero bias peaks (ZBPs) in non-blockaded transport.Specifically, we observe junction-dependent, even-odd modulated, single-electron CB peaks in InAs/Al hybrid nanowires (NWs) without concomitant low-bias peaks in tunneling spectroscopy. We provide a theoretical interpretation of the experimental observations in terms of low-energy, longitudinally-confined island states rather than overlapping Majorana modes. Our results highlight the importance of combined measurements on the same device for the identification of topological MZMs."
https://openalex.org/W4311556918,"Macrophages play a crucial role in inflammation, a defense mechanism of the innate immune system. Metabolic function powered by glucose transporter isoform 1 (Glut1) is necessary for macrophage activity during inflammation. The present study investigated the roles of cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) and its byproduct, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), in macrophage glucose metabolism to explore the mechanism by which H 2 S acts as an inflammatory regulator in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS) induced macrophages. Our results demonstrated that LPS-treated macrophages increased Glut1 expression. LPS-induced Glut1 expression is regulated via nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation and is associated with phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase PI3k activation. Small interfering (si) RNA-mediated silencing of CSE decreased the LPS-induced NF-κB activation and Glut1 expression, suggesting a role for H 2 S in metabolic function in macrophages during pro-inflammatory response. Confoundingly, treatment with GYY4137, an H 2 S-donor molecule, also displayed inhibitory effects upon LPS-induced NF-κB activation and Glut1 expression. Moreover, GYY4137 treatment increased Akt activation, suggesting a role in promoting resolution of inflammation. Our study provides evidence that the source of H 2 S, either endogenous (via CSE) or exogenous (via GYY4137), supports or inhibits the LPS-induced NF-κB activity and Glut1 expression, respectively. Therefore, H 2 S may influence metabolic programming in immune cells to alter glucose substrate availability that impacts the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W4311557048,"Improper nitrogen application time during the crop growing period is one of the most limiting factor for wheat production. A field experiment was conducted in Northwestern Ethiopia with the objective of determining the appropriate N fertilizer application time for improving bread wheat production. Twelve treatments (½ urea at 50% emergence + ½ urea at tillering, ½ urea at tillering + ½ urea at booting, 1/3rd urea at 50% emergence + 1/3rd urea at tillering + 1/3rd urea at booting, 2/3rd urea at tillering + 1/3rd urea at booting, all urea at tillering, all urea at booting, all N at tillering, all N at booting, ½ N at sowing+ ½ N at tillering, ½ N 50% emergence + ½ N at tillering, 1/3rd N at 50% emergence + 1/3rd N at tillering + 1/3rd N at booting, ½ N at tillering + ½ N at booting) were lied out in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The study showed that wheat grain yield and protein content was highly influenced by the environment and indirectly correlated with each other as affected by N time of applications. The grain yield at Adet, Wonberema and Debre Elies was increased by 31%, 14% and 18%, respectively when N was applied with DAP at sowing over the blanket recommendation. At all locations, grain protein content decreased as the number of N split application increased 1 to 3 times. Thus, depending on the purpose of the producers, it can be concluded that application of ½ urea at 50% emergence + ½ urea at tillering with the application of DAP at sowing gave maximum wheat grain yield, while optimum grain protein content was obtained when N was applied after the crop is emerged and would be used in most dominant wheat producing areas of northwestern Ethiopia. Further study should be conducted on split application of blended fertilizers (NPS, NPSBZN etc.)."

https://openalex.org/W4311557173,"Caiuajara dobruskii is a tapejarid pterosaur from the Cretaceous of the ‘Cemitério dos Pterossauros’ (pterosaur graveyard) site, a unique pterosaur bonebed which is located at the municipality of Cruzeiro do Oeste (Paraná, Brazil). Preliminary inferences on Caiuajara morphology were founded on a few partial skeletons, with no detail on the skull anatomy. Here we describe a new specimen from the pterosaur graveyard site, which corresponds to the most complete skull of Caiuajara dobruskii known so far. Furthermore, we describe and compare other specimens including the holotype, a paratype, and several other undescribed specimens. The new specimen preserves the posterior portion of the skull, allowing a better comprehension of its morphology and provides an appreciation of the anatomic structures of the basicranium, enabling better interpretation of this region. We also described the lower jaw of Caiuajara , reporting a unique feature of its symphyseal which adds to the diagnosis for the species. A variability in the premaxillary crest is also noted in different specimens of Caiuajara , which might be interpreted as sexual dimorphism or ontogenetic variability. Therefore, those new findings allow a better comprehension of its skull and enables a more precise comparison between the skulls of those extinct flying reptiles."
https://openalex.org/W4311557082,"The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis states that increased habitat heterogeneity promotes species diversity through increased availability of ecological niches. We aimed at describing the local-scale (i.e. nest and adjacent substrate) effects of nests of the sea lamprey ( Petromyzon marinus L.) as ecosystem engineer on macroinvertebrate assemblages. We hypothesized that increased streambed physical heterogeneity caused by sea lamprey spawning would modify invertebrate assemblages and specific biologic traits and promote reach-scale diversity. We sampled thirty lamprey nests of the Nive River, a river of the south western France with a length of 79.3 km and tributary of the Adour River, in three zones: the unmodified riverbed (upstream) and zones corresponding to the nest: the area excavated (pit) and the downstream accumulation of pebbles and cobbles (mound). The increased habitat heterogeneity created by lamprey was accompanied by biological heterogeneity with a reduced density of invertebrates (3777 ± 1332 individuals per m 2 in upstream, 2649 ± 1386 individuals per m 2 in pit and 3833 ± 1052 individuals per m 2 in mound) and number of taxa (23.5 ± 3.9 taxa for upstream, 18.6 ± 3.9 taxa in pit and 21.2 ± 4.5 taxa for mound) in the pit compared to other zones. However the overall taxa diversity in nest increased with 82 ± 14 taxa compared to the 69 ± 8 taxa estimated in upstream zone. Diversity indices were consistent with the previous results indicating a loss of α diversity in pit but a higher β diversity between a pit and a mound than between two upstream zones, especially considering Morisita index accounting for taxa abundance. Trait analysis showed high functional diversity within zones with a reduced proportion of collectors, scrapers, shredders, litter/mud preference and small invertebrates in mound, while the proportion of “slabs, blocks, stones and pebbles” preference and largest invertebrates increased. Pit presented the opposite trend, while upstream had globally intermediate trait proportions. Our results highlight important effects on species and functional diversity due to habitat heterogeneity created by a nest-building species, what can ultimately influence food webs and nutrient processes in river ecosystems."

https://openalex.org/W4311553100,"Background Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) can add complementary information to physical examination. Despite its development in several medical specialties, there is a lack of similar studies on children by medical interns and cardiologists. Therefore, investigators aimed to assess the effect of short-course training on the performance of medical interns in point-of-care echocardiography in children. Methods This analytic cross-sectional study was conducted on 161 hospitalized children in 17 Shahrivar children’s hospital, Iran, from January 2021 to May 2021. Seven interns (trainees) participated in a short course of point-of-care echocardiography to assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), inferior vena cava collapsibility index (IVCCI), and the presence of pericardial effusion (PEff). Each patient underwent point-of-care echocardiography by one of the trainees. Then, in less than one hour, the echocardiography was performed by a single cardiologist. Agreement between the cardiologist and trainees was examined using Cohen’s kappa coefficient and Prevalence-Adjusted Bias-Adjusted Kappa (PABAK). For numerical variables, the agreement was examined using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results Results showed that the cardiologist and trainees detected LVEF &gt;50, IVCCI &gt;50%, and the absence of PEff in most of the participants. A good agreement in terms of ICC and CCC for LVEF (0.832 and 0.831, respectively) and a good agreement in terms of ICC and CCC for IVCCI (0.878 and 0.877, respectively) were noted. Using categorical scoring of LVEF and IVCCI showed 94.4% and 87.6% complete agreement, respectively. Furthermore, using categorical scoring of LVEF and IVCCI, Cohen’s kappa coefficient was 0.542 (moderate) and 0.619 (substantial), respectively. The PABAK for LVEF and IVCCI were 0.886 (almost perfect) and 0.752 (substantial), respectively. For PEff, Cohen’s kappa and PABAK were 0.797 (moderate) and 0.988 (almost perfect), respectively, and the complete agreement was noted in 160 patients (99.4%). Conclusions This study showed that a short teaching course could help medical interns to assess LVEF, IVCCI, and PEff in children. Therefore, it seems that adding this course to medical interns’ curricula can be promising."
https://openalex.org/W4311556771,"Background Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal morbidity, and oxytocin is the first-line uterotonic agent for PPH prevention. Clinical findings have reported carbetocin to reduce PPH risk without increasing risk of important side effects. Hong Kong is a low PPH burden and high-resource city in China. We aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of PPH prevention with carbetocin from the perspective of Hong Kong public healthcare provider. Methods A decision-analytic model was developed to simulate clinical and economic outcomes of carbetocin and oxytocin for PPH prevention in a hypothetical cohort of women at the third stage of labor following vaginal birth or Caesarean section (C-section). The model inputs were retrieved from literature and public data. Base-case analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed. The model time horizon was the postpartum hospitalization period. Primary model outcomes included PPH-related direct medical cost, PPH, hysterectomy, maternal death, and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss. Results In base-case analysis, carbetocin (versus oxytocin) reduced PPH-related cost (by USD29 per birth), PPH ≥500 mL and ≥1,500 mL (by 13.7 and 1.9 per 1,000 births), hysterectomy (by 0.15 per 1,000 births), maternal death (by 0.02 per 1,000 births), and saved 0.00059 QALY per birth. Relative risk of PPH ≥500 mL with carbetocin versus oxytocin, and proportion of child births by C-section were two influential parameters identified in deterministic sensitivity analysis. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, carbetocin was accepted as cost-effective in &gt;99.7% of the 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of zero USD/QALY. Conclusion PPH prevention with carbetocin appeared to reduce major unfavorable outcomes, and save cost and QALYs."
https://openalex.org/W4311556786,"Molecular biodiversity surveys have been increasingly applied in hyperdiverse tropical regions as an efficient tool for rapid species assessment of partially undiscovered fauna and flora. This is done by overcoming shortfalls in knowledge or availability of reproductive structures during the sampling period, which often represents a bottleneck for accurate specimens’ identification. DNA sequencing technology is intensifying species discovery, and in combination with morphological identification, has been filling gaps in taxonomic knowledge and facilitating species inventories of tropical ecosystems. This study aimed to apply morphological taxonomy and DNA barcoding to assess the occurrence of Lamiaceae species in converted land-use systems (old-growth forest, jungle rubber, rubber, and oil palm) in Sumatra, Indonesia. In this species inventory, we detected 89 specimens of Lamiaceae from 18 species distributed in seven subfamilies from the Lamiaceae group. One third of the species identified in this study lacked sequences in the reference database for at least one of the markers used ( matK , rbcL , and ITS). The three loci species-tree recovered a total of 12 out of the 18 species as monophyletic lineages and can be employed as a suitable approach for molecular species assignment in Lamiaceae. However, for taxa with a low level of interspecific genetic distance in the barcode regions used in this study, such as Vitex gamosepala Griff. and V . vestita Wall. ex Walp., or Callicarpa pentandra Roxb. and C . candidans (Burm.f.) Hochr., the use of traditional taxonomy remains indispensable. A change in species composition and decline in abundance is associated with an increase in land-use intensification at the family level (i.e., Lamiaceae), and this tendency might be constant across other plant families. For this reason, the maintenance of forest genetic resources needs to be considered for sustainable agricultural production, especially in hyperdiverse tropical regions. Additionally, with this change in species composition, accurate species identification throughout molecular assignments will become more important for conservation planning."
https://openalex.org/W4311556848,"Objectives Noninvasive fetal electrocardiography (FECG) offers many advantages over alternative fetal monitoring techniques in evaluating fetal health conditions. However, it is difficult to extract a clean FECG signal with morphological features from an abdominal ECG recorded at the maternal abdomen; the signal is usually contaminated by the maternal ECG and various noises. The aim of the work is to extract an FECG signal that preserves the morphological features from the mother’s abdominal ECG recording, which allows for accurately estimating the fetal heart rate (FHR) and analyzing the waveforms of the fetal ECG. Methods We propose a novel nonlinear adaptive noise cancelling framework (ANC) based on a temporal convolutional neural network (CNN) to effectively extract fetal ECG signals from mothers’ abdominal ECG recordings. The proposed framework consists of a two-stage network, using the ANC architecture; one network is for the maternal ECG component elimination and the other is for the residual noise component removal of the extracted fetal ECG signal. Then, JADE (one of the blind source separation algorithms) is applied as a postprocessing step to produce a clean fetal ECG signal. Results Synthetic ECG data (FECGSYNDB) and clinical ECG data (NIFECGDB, PCDB) are used to evaluate the extraction performance of the proposed framework. The statistical and visual results demonstrate that our method outperforms the other state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. Specifically, on the FECGSYNDB, the mean squared error (MSE), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), correlation coefficient (R) and F 1 -score of our method are 0.16, 7.94, 0.95 and 98.89%, respectively. The F 1 -score on the NIFECGDB reaches 98.62%. The value of the F 1 -score on the PCDB is 98.62%. Conclusion As opposed to the existing algorithms being restricted to fetal QRS complex detection, the proposed framework can preserve the morphological features of the extracted fetal ECG signal well, which could support medical diagnoses based on the morphology of the fetal ECG signal."
https://openalex.org/W4311556851,"This study provides evidence for the supply network position influencing innovation performance and the moderating effect of digital transformation. Supply chain relationships have been evaluated in earlier research to demonstrate how concentrations of customers and suppliers may either favorably or adversely impact innovation. These metrics, however, only take into account how closely a firm is connected to its direct customers or suppliers. This study integrates the top five suppliers and customers of Chinese listed manufacturing firms and considers the relationship embeddedness of each firm’s direct customers and suppliers, as well as the structure embeddedness among the customers’ customers, customers’ suppliers, suppliers’ customers, and suppliers’ suppliers to reveal the true impact of supply chain relationships on innovation performance. The top five suppliers and consumers of each firm are chosen to build a supply network for each year using panel data of listed Chinese manufacturing firms from 2013 to 2020. Social network analysis is used to determine network centrality and structural holes. The results show that in the supply network, network centrality and structural holes are significantly negatively correlated with innovation performance, especially in small and medium-sized firms, non-state-owned firms, and firms in recession phase. According to the moderating effect model, digital transformation is an efficient way to reduce the negative effect of supply network position on innovation performance. The research results will further improve the supply network cooperation mechanism, which is of great significance for improving supply chain resilience and firms’ innovation."
https://openalex.org/W4311556873,"Background In 2019, 600’000 people in Africa died of heart failure and heart diseases will increase on the continent. It is crucial to understand the regional etiologies and risk factors for heart failure and underlying heart diseases. However, echocardiography data from rural Africa are scarce and from Lesotho non-existent. This study aims to examine the occurrence, characteristics and etiology of heart failure and heart diseases using echocardiography data from a referral hospital in rural Lesotho. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Seboche Mission Hospital, the only referral hospital in Butha-Buthe district (Lesotho) with an echocardiography department. We included data from all individuals referred to the department between January 2020 and May 2021. From non-hospitalized patients echocardiographic diagnosis, sex and age were available, from hospitalized patients additional sociodemographic and clinical data could be extracted. Results In the study period, a total of 352 echocardiograms were conducted; 213 had abnormal findings (among them 3 children). The majority of adult participants (130/210; 64%) were female and most frequent heart diseases were hypertensive (62/210, 30%), valvular (39/210, 19%) and chronic pulmonary (37/210, 18%). Heart failure represented 11% of hospitalizations in the same period. Among the 126 hospitalized heart failure patients, the most common etiology was chronic pulmonary heart disease (32/126; 25%). Former mine workers and people with a history of tuberculosis were more likely to have a chronic pulmonary heart disease. Conclusions The leading cause of heart disease in this setting is hypertension. However, in contrast to other African epidemiological studies, chronic pulmonary heart disease is unexpectedly common. There is an urgent need to improve awareness and knowledge about lung diseases, make diagnostic and therapeutic options available and increase prevention."
https://openalex.org/W4311556896,"Previous studies have used a query-based approach to search and gather scientific literature. Instead, the current study focused on domain-specific journals in the field of eating disorders. A total of 8651 documents (since 1981 to 2020), from which 7899 had an abstract, were retrieved from: International Journal of Eating Disorders (n = 4185, 48.38%), Eating and Weight Disorders (n = 1540, 17.80%), European Eating Disorders Review (n = 1461, 16.88%), Eating Disorders (n = 1072, 12.39%), and Journal of Eating Disorders (n = 393, 4.54%). To analyze these data, diverse methodologies were employed: bibliometrics (to identify top cited documents), network analysis (to identify the most representative scholars and collaboration networks), and topic modeling (to retrieve major topics using text mining, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms). The results showed that the most cited documents were related to instruments used for the screening and evaluation of eating disorders, followed by review articles related to the epidemiology, course and outcome of eating disorders. Network analysis identified well-known scholars in the field, as well as their collaboration networks. Finally, topic modeling identified 10 major topics whereas a time series analysis of these topics identified relevant historical shifts. This study discusses the results in terms of future opportunities in the field of eating disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4311556899,"Widespread adolescent involvement in organized sport means that sport contexts are well-suited to 'actively' integrate prevention programs that may promote population-level change. This mixed methods study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a peer-based mental health literacy intervention. The intervention (i.e., Team Talk) was presented to eleven adolescent sport teams in the United States, with a total of 174 participants. Athlete participants completed surveys immediately before and after the intervention-including measures of workshop acceptability, social identity, and help-seeking behaviors. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with a subset of five athletes, nine parents, and two coaches. With respect to recruitment as an indicator of feasibility, club-level adoption of the intervention was low, with difficulty recruiting clubs for intervention delivery. This signals that feasibility of the intervention-as it is currently designed and implemented by the research team-is low when considering similar competitive adolescent sport clubs and delivered as team-level workshops. Meanwhile, participants reported high acceptability of the intervention, and acceptability levels across participants was predicted by contextual factors related to implementation such as session duration. Regarding limited efficacy testing with measures completed before and after the intervention session: (a) social identity scores increased following the intervention, and (b) significant differences were not identified regarding efficacy to recognize symptoms of mental disorders. Athlete, coach, and parent interview responses also described potential adaptations to mental health programs. This research demonstrates the potential utility of peer-based mental health literacy interventions, while also revealing that further implementation research is necessary to adapt mental health literacy interventions to suit diverse adolescent sport contexts."

https://openalex.org/W4311557073,"Overcrowding is a well-known problem in hospitals and emergency departments (ED) that can negatively impact patients and staff. This study aims to present a machine learning model to detect a patient's need for a Computed Tomography (CT) exam in the emergency department at the earliest possible time. The data for this work was collected from ED at Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre over one year (05/2016-05/2017) and contained administrative triage information. The target outcome was whether or not a patient required a CT exam. Multiple combinations of text embedding methods, machine learning algorithms, and data resampling methods were experimented with to find the optimal model for this task. The final model was trained with 81, 118 visits and tested on a hold-out test set with a size of 9, 013 visits. The best model achieved a ROC AUC score of 0.86 and had a sensitivity of 87.3% and specificity of 70.9%. The most important factors that led to a CT scan order were found to be chief complaint, treatment area, and triage acuity. The proposed model was able to successfully identify patients needing a CT using administrative triage data that is available at the initial stage of a patient's arrival. By determining that a CT scan is needed early in the patient's visit, the ED can allocate resources to ensure these investigations are completed quickly and patient flow is maintained to reduce overcrowding."
https://openalex.org/W4311606219,"Lepidopteran pests are major factors limiting soybean productivity in South America. In some cases, effective management of these species requires the use of foliar insecticides. For sustainable use of these insecticides, they should only be applied when insect population size exceeds an economic threshold. Since this estimation requires to determine the consumption of different species, this work aimed to integrate all these factors, studying the consumption of small (less than 1 cm long) and medium (1 to 1.5 cm long) size larvae of major lepidopteran pests to vegetative and reproductive tissues on Bt (M7739IPRO variety, containing the event MON87701 which expresses the Cry1Ac protein from Bacillus thuringiensis) and non-Bt (BMX Desafio RR variety) soybeans. The feeding injury to vegetative tissues was tested in detached-leaf assays in grow chambers, and for reproductive structures the study was conducted in greenhouse with infestations at early (flowering) and mid reproductive (mid grain filling) stages. Based on the feeding behavior of the species tested, they were cast in four groups: a) Anticarsia gemmatalis and Chrysodeixis includens, defoliating only the RR variety with the lowest consumption of foliar area; b) Spodoptera eridania, defoliating both RR and IPRO varieties, consuming twice than the species mentioned above; c) Helicoverpa armigera, defoliating and being the most damaging species to pods in the RR variety; and d) S. cosmioides and S. frugiperda, defoliating and damaging pods in both varieties. The species differed in their ability to feed on IPRO varieties, so a different economic threshold should be considered. Consequently, in cases where more than one species are found simultaneously, the species composition should be considered in estimating the economic threshold. Additionally, our findings may contribute to a better decision-making to control insect feeding injury in IPRO varieties, because a slower larval growth provides more time to ensure the need of control with insecticides. In summary, this clasification contributes to an improved recommendation of sustainable insecticide use, taking into account the behavior of each species that are major soybeans pests in South America."
https://openalex.org/W4311606525,"Background One of the major factors contributing to newborn morbidity and mortality across the globe is respiratory distress. In resource-constrained developing nations like Ethiopia, it is a significant issue. Depending on the quality of the care provided, the incidence and time to recovery may differ amongst medical facilities. However, Ethiopia still lacks appropriate data on the incidence and time to recovery from respiratory distress. Objective The aim of the study was to assess the incidence, time to recovery, and predictors among neonates admitted with respiratory distress in the neonatal intensive care unit at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. Methods An institution-based retrospective follow-up study design was conducted among 452 neonates with respiratory distress. Data were collected using a data extraction checklist from the medical registry. The extracted data were entered into EPI INFO version 7.2.1.0 and then exported to STATA version 14 for analysis. The median time to recovery, the Kaplan Meier curve, and the log-rank test was computed. Both bi-variable and multivariable Cox regression models were applied to analyze the data. p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of all respiratory distressed neonate,311 were recovered. The overall incidence rate of neonates admitted with from respiratory distress was 11.5 per 100-neonate day (95% CI: 10.30–12. 87) with 2,703-person day observation and the median time to recovery from respiratory distress was 7 days with (IQR = 3–13 days). Predictors of time to recovery from respiratory distress were very low birth weight (AHR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.08–0.41), low birth weight (AHR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.31–0.81), very preterm (AHR = 0.42,95% CI:0.20–0.89), sepsis (AHR = 0.50 95% CI: 0.38–0.65), hypothermia (AHR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39–0.81), and Apgar scores less than seven at first (AHR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.15–0.79) and fifth minute (AHR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.20–0.97). Conclusion The incidence and time to recovery in this study were discreetly acceptable as compared to previous study. The aforementioned predictors could be used to identify neonates with respiratory distress who are at risk of developing a long-term illness and guide prompt referral to hospitals. This will also provide clinicians with prognostic information, as longer recovery times have economic and social implications in resource limited countries like Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W4311606537,"A never event is the most egregious of patient safety incidents. It refers to events that should theoretically never happen, such amputating the wrong limb. The term ""never event"" is used around the world by a variety of medical and patient safety organizations and is synonymous with sentinel events and serious reportable events. Unfortunately, there is little consensus about which events, in particular, are never events. These differing lists hinder potential collaboration or large-scale analyses. A recent systematic review by Hegarty et al. (2020) identified the need for a standardized definition for serious reportable events. The objective of our systematic review is to build on this by identifying which events are consistently or frequently identified as never events in order to isolate those which are core never events.A systematic review will be conducted using Medline, Medline in Process, Scopus, PsychINFO, Embase via OVID, and CINAHL via EBSCO databases, as well as grey literature. We will include articles of any study design that discuss never events or one of its synonymous terms in the context of medical care. Four independent reviewers will conduct the title and abstract as well as the full-text screening, and 2 reviewers will abstract data. Data will be analyzed using narrative synthesis. Results will be categorized by year and geographic location, and by other factors determined during full-text screening.The lack of consensus regarding never events hinders progress in reducing their occurrence. Differing data sources makes comparison challenging, and limits the ability for patient safety groups to work collaboratively and share learnings with others. Identifying a core set of never events will serve as a first step to focus our efforts to reduce these harmful incidents."
https://openalex.org/W4311606574,"Introduction The prevalence of polypharmacy increases with age, increasing the exposure of older adults to potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). Deprescribing has been shown to reduce PIMs for older residents in long-term care; however, deprescribing is not universally implemented. This study aims to identify the barriers and enablers to deprescribing in Irish long-term care facilities from the healthcare professionals’ (HCPs) perspective. Methods A qualitative descriptive approach was conducted using semi-structured interviews with HCPs working in long-term care (general practitioners, pharmacists and nurses). Purposive sampling with maximum variation was applied to select long-term care sites to identify HCPs, supplemented with convenience sampling of post-graduate HCPs from University College Cork. Data was thematically analysed and mapped to a framework of deprescribing barriers and enablers informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework. Results Twenty-six HCPs participated from 13 long-term care facilities. The main barriers and enablers identified mapped to five domains. Barriers included insufficient resources, lack of co-ordination between healthcare settings and negative social influences. Additional barriers exist in private settings including deprescribing awareness, commitment and the need for incentives. Deprescribing enablers included interprofessional support and patient social influence. To encourage deprescribing, potential enablers include HCP education, pharmacist role expansion and tailored deprescribing guidelines within a structured process. Conclusion Interventions to support deprescribing should build on existing systems, involve stakeholders and utilise guidelines within a structured process. Any intervention must account for the nuanced barriers and enablers which exist in both public and private settings."
https://openalex.org/W4311606628,"Objectives The range of motion (ROM) of the cervical spine and postural stability are important for an economical and motorically adequate adaptation of the body to any situation. Therefore, this study aims to analyze whether these two components of postural and movement control can be influenced by means of a splint in a centric position compared to habitual occlusion. Methods 38 recreational male athletes volunteered. Cervical spine ROM was recorded using an ultrasound system and the a pressure measuring plate for postural stability (length of center of pressure (CoP) movement, area of CoP). The two dental occlusion conditions employed were the habitual occlusion and wearing a splint in an idealized, condylar position close to the centric position. Level of significance was set at ρ ≤ 0.05. Results The cervical spine mobility increased significantly by wearing the splint regarding rotation to the left (+3.9%) and right (+2.7%) and lateral flexion to the left (+4.4%) and right (+6.7%). Wearing the splint reduced the area of sway deflections by about 31.5% in the bipedal stance and by about 2.4% (left) and 28.2% (right) in the unipedal stance. The CoP trace was reduced in the sagittal plane by approximately 8.2% in the right single-leg stance. Conclusions The major findings seem to demonstrate that wearing a splint that keeps the jaw close to the centric relation may increase the cervical ROM and may improve balance stability in male recreational athletes. Changing the jaw relation in athletes can possibly aid the release of performance potentials by improving coordination skills."
https://openalex.org/W4311606643,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects 7–18% of all pregnancies. Despite its high prevalence, there is no widely accepted animal model. To address this, we recently developed a mouse model of GDM. The goal of this work was to further characterize this animal model by assessing insulin resistance and beta cell function. Mice were randomly assigned to either control (CD) or high fat, high sugar (HFHS) diet and mated 1 week later. At day 0 (day of mating) mice were fasted and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests (ipITT) were performed. Mice were then euthanized and pancreata were collected for histological analysis. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp experiments were performed on day 13.5 of pregnancy to assess insulin resistance. Beta cell function was assessed by glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) assay performed on day 0, 13.5 and 17.5 of pregnancy. At day 0, insulin tolerance and beta cell numbers were not different. At day 13.5, glucose infusion and disposal rates were significantly decreased (p&lt;0.05) in Pregnant (P) HFHS animals (p&lt;0.05) suggesting development of insulin resistance in P HFHS dams. Placental and fetal glucose uptake was significantly increased (p&lt;0.01) in P HFHS dams at day 13.5 of pregnancy and by day 17.5 of pregnancy fetal weights were increased (p&lt;0.05) in P HFHS dams compared to P CD dams. Basal and secreted insulin levels were increased in HFHS fed females at day 0, however at day 13.5 and 17.5 GSIS was decreased (p&lt;0.05) in P HFHS dams. In conclusion, this animal model results in insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction by mid-pregnancy further validating its relevance in studying the pathophysiology GDM."
https://openalex.org/W4311606701,"Flying social insects can provide model systems for in-flight interactions in computationally-constrained aerial robot swarms. The social interactions in flying insects may be chemically modulated and quantified via recent measurement advancements able to simultaneously make precise measurements of insect wing and body motions. This paper presents the first in-flight quantitative measurements of ethanol-exposed honey bee body and wing kinematics in archival literature. Four high-speed cameras (9000 frames/sec) were used to record the wing and body motions of flying insects ( Apis mellifera ) and automated analysis was used to extract 9000 frame/sec measurements of honey bees’ wing and body motions through data association, hull reconstruction, and segmentation. The kinematic changes induced by exposure to incremental ethanol concentrations from 0% to 5% were studied using statistical analysis tools. Analysis considered trial-wise mean and maximum values and gross wingstroke parameters, and tested deviations for statistical significance using Welch’s t-test and Cohen’s d test. The results indicate a decrease in maximal heading and pitch rates of the body, and that roll rate is affected at high concentrations (5%). The wingstroke effects include a stroke frequency decrease and stroke amplitude increase for 2.5% or greater concentrations, gradual stroke inclination angle increase up to 2.5% concentration, and a more planar wingstroke with increasing concentration according to bulk wingstroke analysis. These ethanol-exposure effects provide a basis to separate ethanol exposure and neighbor effects in chemically mediated interaction studies."
https://openalex.org/W4311606762,"Grip strength is an important biomarker reflecting muscle strength, and depression is a psychiatric disorder all over the world. Several studies found a significant inverse association between grip strength and depression, and there is also evidence for common physiological mechanisms between them. We used twin data from Qingdao, China to calculate genetic correlations, and we performed a bivariate GWAS to explore potential SNPs, genes, and pathways in common between grip strength and depression. 139 pairs of Dizygotic twins were used for bivariate GWAS. VEAGSE2 and PASCAL software were used for gene-based analysis and pathway enrichment analysis, respectively. And the resulting SNPs were subjected to eQTL analysis and pleiotropy analysis. The genetic correlation coefficient between grip strength and depression was -0.41 (-0.96, -0.15). In SNP-based analysis, 7 SNPs exceeded the genome-wide significance level (P<5×10-8) and a total of 336 SNPs reached the level of suggestive significance (P<1×10-5). Gene-based analysis and pathway-based analysis identified genes and pathways related to muscle strength and the nervous system. The results of eQTL analysis were mainly enriched in tissues such as the brain, thyroid, and skeletal muscle. Pleiotropy analysis shows that 9 of the 15 top SNPs were associated with both grip strength and depression. In conclusion, this bivariate GWAS identified potentially common pleiotropic SNPs, genes, and pathways in grip strength and depression."
https://openalex.org/W4311606927,"Background Colorectal and gastric cancer are major causes of cancer-related deaths. In Korea, gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic biopsy specimens account for a high percentage of histopathologic examinations. Lack of a sufficient pathologist workforce can cause an increase in human errors, threatening patient safety. Therefore, we developed a digital pathology total solution combining artificial intelligence (AI) classifier models and pathology laboratory information system for GI endoscopic biopsy specimens to establish a post-analytic daily fast quality control (QC) system, which was applied in clinical practice for a 3-month trial run by four pathologists. Methods and findings Our whole slide image (WSI) classification framework comprised patch-generator, patch-level classifier, and WSI-level classifier. The classifiers were both based on DenseNet (Dense Convolutional Network). In laboratory tests, the WSI classifier achieved accuracy rates of 95.8% and 96.0% in classifying histopathological WSIs of colorectal and gastric endoscopic biopsy specimens, respectively, into three classes (Negative for dysplasia, Dysplasia, and Malignant). Classification by pathologic diagnosis and AI prediction were compared and daily reviews were conducted, focusing on discordant cases for early detection of potential human errors by the pathologists, allowing immediate correction, before the pathology report error is conveyed to the patients. During the 3-month AI-assisted daily QC trial run period, approximately 7–10 times the number of slides compared to that in the conventional monthly QC (33 months) were reviewed by pathologists; nearly 100% of GI endoscopy biopsy slides were double-checked by the AI models. Further, approximately 17–30 times the number of potential human errors were detected within an average of 1.2 days. Conclusions The AI-assisted daily QC system that we developed and established demonstrated notable improvements in QC, in quantitative, qualitative, and time utility aspects. Ultimately, we developed an independent AI-assisted post-analytic daily fast QC system that was clinically applicable and influential, which could enhance patient safety."

https://openalex.org/W4311556757,"Background Increased intrahepatic bile acids cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated to maintain homeostasis. UPR dysregulation, including the inositol-requiring enzyme 1α/X-box protein 1 (IRE1α/XBP1) pathway, is associated with adult liver diseases but has not been characterized in pediatric liver diseases. We evaluated hepatic UPR expression in pediatric cholestatic liver disease (CLD) explants and hypothesize that an inability to appropriately activate the hepatic IRE1α/XBP1 pathway is associated with the pathogenesis of CLD. Methods We evaluated 34 human liver explants, including: pediatric CLD (Alagille, ALGS, and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, PFIC), pediatric non-cholestatic liver disease controls (autoimmune hepatitis, AIH), adult CLD, and normal controls. We performed RNA-seq, quantitative PCR, and western blotting to measure expression differences of the hepatic UPR and other signaling pathways. Results Pathway analysis demonstrated that the KEGG ‘protein processing in ER’ pathway was downregulated in pediatric CLD compared to normal controls. Pediatric CLD had decreased hepatic IRE1α/XBP1 pathway gene expression and decreased protein expression of phosphorylated IRE1α compared to normal controls. IRE1α/XBP1 pathway gene expression was also decreased in pediatric CLD compared to AIH disease controls. Conclusions Pediatric CLD explants have decreased expression of the protective IRE1α/XBP1 pathway and down-regulated KEGG protein processing in the ER pathways. IRE1α/XBP1 pathway expression differences occur when compared to both normal and non-cholestatic disease controls. Attenuated expression of the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway is associated with cholestatic diseases and may be a target for future therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4311556764,"The newly emerged COVID-19 has an unprecedented impact on all classes of people, particularly the elderly. The knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of older adults toward COVID-19 are currently unknown. This study aimed to investigate the KAP and its associated factors toward COVID-19 among older adults in Bangladesh.A cross-sectional survey was conducted from April to May 2021 among Bangladeshi older adults. Face-to-face interviews were used to collect data from five selected divisions in Bangladesh using simple random sampling. The questionnaire consisted of socio-demographic characteristics, disease conditions, and KAP toward COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and logistic regression analyses were performed.Out of 900 respondents, the majority of older adults (82.9%) indicated that COVID-19 is a viral disease and the major clinical symptom of COVID-19 (86.5%). Only 22.1% of participants always washed their hands with soap or hand sanitizer, and 27.6% wore a mask to protect against the virus when going outside the home. Overall, 55.2% had adequate knowledge, 50.2% had positive attitudes toward COVID-19 and only 22.7% had good practices. Out of 30 scores, mean score values were 20.8±6.7 in the knowledge section, 21.2±4.3 in the attitude section, and 11.3±6.7 in the practice section out of 30. In binary logistic regression analysis, factors associated with poor knowledge, and practices were being male, aged >70 years, having a primary education, less income <5000BDT, and multimorbidity (p < 0.05). Participants having poor knowledge of COVID-19 had higher likelihood of negative attitudes (OR: 6.79, 95% CI = 4.87-9.47, p < 0.001) and poor practices (OR: 9.15, 95% CI = 6.94-13.16, p < 0.001).The findings highlight the need for immediate implementation of health education programs and adequate intervention programs for COVID-19 which integrates consideration of associated factors to improve the level of older adults' knowledge, attitudes, and practices."

A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Ningbo City, China, from April 8 to 12, 2022. We assessed the behavioral differences and correlates of mask usage, primarily mask-removal. We examined public mask-wearing behavior during on-site COVID-19 nucleic acid detection. The survey instrument was developed based on the guidelines issued by the World Health Organization and consisted of demographics, mask-wearing knowledge, and behavior. We analyzed data from 1180 participants; 73.2% demonstrated good mask-wearing knowledge. However, regarding mask-wearing behavior, only 53.7% knew the correct way to remove a mask; 70.3% maintained hand hygiene after touching the outside. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that health prevention knowledge and free mask distribution were positively associated with two types of mask-wearing behaviors. Most participants used masks during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, mask-removal and hand hygiene were neglected when touching the outside of the mask. More attention must be paid to mask-removal and hand hygiene details. Local health authorities should consider introducing the free distribution of masks."
https://openalex.org/W4311556882,"Empathy in the doctor-patient relationship is of great importance and has long been considered a true professional virtue for doctors. Despite the general agreement concerning the importance of empathy, there is no consensus regarding the definition of empathy in medical research. While several quantitative studies, measuring empathy as an individual trait, show a decline in empathy among medical students, other studies have shown that empathy is influenced by contextual factors as well as the availability of role models. Therefore, further studies about the transition from medical school to clinical work also including the perspective of senior doctors are needed. The study presented in this article aims to better understand the clinical conditions for empathy through interviews with senior doctors about their lived experience of empathy. Twelve senior doctors, from different specialities were interviewed using a semi-structured approach. The data was analysed using content analysis. The analysis resulted in the main theme: Empathy as a silent art-a doctor`s daily balancing act. This main theme comprised three categories: ""A tacit, yet language-dependent process"", ""A daily balancing act"" and ""An unsupported path towards mastery"". Doctors face many challenges in their daily balancing act between individual and structural conditions that may affect empathy. In order to maintain and further develop empathy, doctors need working conditions allowing for collegial reflection and conversations that promote empathy."
https://openalex.org/W4311556891,"Characterizing the effect of age and sex on macular retinal layer thicknesses and foveal pit morphology is crucial to differentiating between natural and disease-related changes. We applied advanced image analysis techniques to optical coherence tomography (OCT) to: 1) enhance the spatial description of age and sex effects, and 2) create a detailed open database of normative retinal layer thickness maps and foveal pit shapes. The maculae of 444 healthy subjects (age range 21-88) were imaged with OCT. Using computational spatial data analysis, thickness maps were obtained for retinal layers and averaged into 400 (20 x 20) sectors. Additionally, the geometry of the foveal pit was radially analyzed by computing the central foveal thickness, rim height, rim radius, and mean slope. The effect of age and sex on these parameters was analyzed with multiple regression mixed-effects models. We observed that the overall age-related decrease of the total retinal thickness (TRT) (-1.1% per 10 years) was mainly driven by the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) (-2.4% per 10 years). Both TRT and GCIPL thinning patterns were homogeneous across the macula when using percentual measurements. Although the male retina was 4.1 μm thicker on average, the greatest differences were mainly present for the inner retinal layers in the inner macular ring (up to 4% higher TRT than in the central macula). There was an age-related decrease in the rim height (1.0% per 10 years) and males had a higher rim height, shorter rim radius, and steeper mean slope. Importantly, the radial analysis revealed that these changes are present and relatively uniform across angular directions. These findings demonstrate the capacity of advanced analysis of OCT images to enhance the description of the macula. This, together with the created dataset, could aid the development of more accurate diagnosis models for macular pathologies."

The healthcare profession is amongst the very few careers that are attributed to a very high level of stress and imbalanced work-life equilibrium. Over past decades, the said nature of work has been observed to coerce countless nurses to leave their respective organizations. Considering this, the current study primarily evaluates the impact of role stressors on the turnover intentions of nurses employed in the healthcare industry of Pakistan. Secondly, the study examines the mediatory role of organizational cynicism between the role stressors and turnover intentions to explain the escalating trend of nurses intending to leave the industry. Lastly, it assesses the moderating role of self-efficacy between the organizational cynicism and the intended turnover of a nurse, to gauge the amount of variation self-efficacy can cause to mitigate the negative attitudes of employed individuals. The current study was conducted in the twin metropolitans of Pakistan i.e., Rawalpindi and Islamabad. A total of 394 responses were statistically evaluated using SmartPLS 3.0. The results of the current study indicated a significant impact of role stressors on the turnover intentions of nurses. Also, organizational cynicism was observed as a significant mediator between role stressors and turnover intentions. Further, self-efficacy as well was observed as a significant moderator between organizational cynicism and the intent of healthcare workers to leave the organization. The present study addressed the conceptual research gap by exploring the direct cumulative effect of role stress (role ambiguity, role conflict, role stressors, work-family conflict) in developing the intents of professionals to quit their employing organizations, the mediatory role of organizational cynicism, and the moderation effect of self-efficacy between the undertaken variables. While in terms of abridging the contextual research gap, the current study evaluated the proposed research model within the healthcare sector of Pakistan. The findings of the current study commended the management personnel of the healthcare industry to provide the nurses with healthy professional environments to work in, as well as catering to their professional and personal expectations to a better extent. Hence, increasing the ownership of an individual depicted towards his/her employing organization."

The primary outcome was the rate of SSIs within 30 days after surgery and secondary outcomes were the rate of wound healing complications.SSI rate was 2.5% in Triclosan group compared to 8.1% with non-coated suture. Use of Triclosan coated suture (TCS) was associated with 69% reduction in SSI rate (p = 0.037; ORa:0.294; 95% CI:0.094-0.921). The use of Triclosan coated suture was associated with statistically lower risk of wound oedema (2.5% vs 10%), (p = 0.019; OR:0.595), dehiscence (3.8% vs 10.6%), (p = 0.023; OR:0.316) and hematoma (p = 0.035; OR:0.423).Our results confirm the effectiveness of Triclosan coated suture in reducing SSI rate and wound healing disturbances.Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov / ID (NCT05330650)."
https://openalex.org/W4311606244,"The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has led countries worldwide to administer quarantine policies. However, each country or state independently decides what mobility restrictions to administer within its borders while aiming to maximize its own citizens' welfare. Since individuals travel between countries and states, the policy in one country affects the infection levels in other countries. Therefore, a major question is whether the policies dictated by multiple governments could be efficient. Here we focus on the decision regarding the timing of releasing quarantines, which were common during the first year of the pandemic. We consider a game-theoretical epidemiological model in which each government decides when to switch from a restrictive to a non-restrictive quarantine and vice versa. We show that, if travel between countries is frequent, then the policy dictated by multiple governments is sub-optimal. But if international travel is restricted, then the policy may become optimal."
https://openalex.org/W4311606248,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory and bone-resorptive cytokine that also regulates bone formation. We previously showed that prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) induces the synthesis of IL-6 by activating p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), and p38 MAPK in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. In the present study, we investigated whether heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), a molecular chaperone that coordinates protein folding and homeostasis, affects PGE1-stimulated IL-6 synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells through the MAPK activation. The osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with HSP70 inhibitors-VER-155008 and YM-08-, PD98059, SB203580 or SP600125 and then stimulated with PGE1. IL-6 synthesis was evaluated using an IL-6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. IL-6 mRNA expression was measured by real-time RT-PCR. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was evaluated by Western blotting. We found that VER-155008, an HSP70 inhibitor, enhanced the PGE1-stimulated IL-6 release and IL-6 mRNA expression. YM-08, another HSP70 inhibitor, also enhanced PGE1-stimulated IL-6 release. PD98059, a p44/p42 MAPK inhibitor, and SP600125, a SAPK/JNK inhibitor, upregulated PGE1-stimulated IL-6 release. On the other hand, SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, suppressed PGE1-stimulated IL-6 release. YM-08 stimulated the PGE1-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. SB203580 suppressed the amplification by YM-08 of the PGE1-stimulated IL-6 release. Our results suggest that HSP70 inhibitors upregulate the PGE1-stimulated IL-6 synthesis through p38 MAPK in osteoblasts and therefore affect bone remodeling."

The cardiometabolic deaths attributable to poor diet have not been quantified among Kuwaiti adults.Using a Comparative Risk Assessment model that incorporated dietary intake data from Kuwait's first national nutrition survey, number of cardiometabolic deaths from the World Health Organization, and estimated associations of diet with cardiometabolic deaths from the Global Burden of Disease project, we estimated the number and proportion of cardiometabolic deaths attributable to suboptimal intake of 10 dietary factors among Kuwaiti adults ages 25+ years, and by population subgroups.An estimated 1,308 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] = 1,228-1,485) cardiometabolic deaths were attributed to suboptimal diet, accounting for 64.7% (95% UI = 60.7%-73.4%) of all cardiometabolic deaths in Kuwait in 2009. The low intake of nuts/seeds was associated with the highest estimated number and proportion of cardiometabolic deaths (n = 380, 18.8%), followed by high intake of sodium (n = 256, 12.6%), low intake of fruits (n = 250, 12.4%), low intake of vegetables (n = 236, 11.7%), low intake of whole grains (n = 201, 9.9%), and high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (n = 201, 9.9%). The estimated proportions of cardiometabolic deaths attributable to suboptimal diet were higher in men (67.7%) than women (57.8%) and in younger adults aged 25-34 years (84.5%) than older adults aged ≥55 years (55.6%).Suboptimal dietary intake was associated with a very substantial proportion of cardiometabolic deaths among Kuwaiti adults in 2009, with young adults and men experiencing the largest proportion of diet-associated cardiometabolic deaths in Kuwait."
https://openalex.org/W4311606416,"TRPML3 (mucolipin 3, MCOLN3) is an endolysosomal cation channel belonging to the TRPML subfamily of transient receptor potential channels. Gain-of-function mutations in the Trpml3 gene cause deafness, circling behavior and coat color dilution in mice due to cell death of TRPML3-expressing hair cells of the inner ear or skin melanocytes, respectively. Furthermore, TRPML3 was found to play a role in the long term survival of cochlear hair cells (its absence contributing to presbycusis), in specialized giant lysosomes that neonatal (birth to weaning) enterocytes used for the uptake and digestion of maternal milk nutrients, and in the expulsion of exosome-encased bacteria such as uropathogenic E. coli, infecting bladder epithelial cells. Recently, TRPML3 was found to be expressed at high levels in alveolar macrophages and loss of TRPML3 results in a lung emphysema phenotype, confirmed in two independently engineered Trpml3 knockout lines. TRPML3 is not ubiquitously expressed like its relative TRPML1 and thus cellular expression of TRPML3 on a whole-tissue level remains, with the exceptions mentioned above, largely elusive. To overcome this problem, we generated a τGFP reporter mouse model for TRPML3 and compared expression data obtained from this model by immunofluorescence on tissue sections with immunohistochemistry using TRPML3 antibodies and in situ hybridization. We thus uncovered expression in several organs and distinct cell types. We confirmed TRPML3 expression in both neonatal and adult alveolar macrophages, in melanocytes of hair follicles and glabrous skin, in principle cells of the collecting duct of the neonatal and adult kidney, and in olfactory sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium, including its fibres protruding to the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. Additionally, we localized TRPML3 in several glands including parathyroid, thyroid, salivary, adrenal, and pituitary gland, testes and ovaries, suggestive of potential roles for the channel in secretion or uptake of different hormones."

However, there is currently limited research investigating the impact of the heat on soccer-specific decision-making skills during exercise reflective of the physical demands of match-play. Therefore, the effects of heat exposure on physical and soccer-specific decision-making performance, biological markers (i.e., metanephrines), appraisal (i.e., challenge vs. threat) and affective states, during prolonged high-intensity intermittent exercise were investigated. Nine well-trained male soccer players completed a 92-min cycling intermittent sprint protocol (CISP), whilst simultaneously responding to a series of soccer-specific decision-making trials at various time points, in two temperature conditions: hot (32°C, 50%rh) and temperate (18°C, 50%rh). Results showed that decision-making score (p = .030) was impaired in the hot compared to the temperate condition. There was a reduced workload in the second half during the hot condition (p = .016), which coincided with a heightened threat state (p = .007) and more unpleasant feelings (p = .008) experienced in the hot, compared to temperate, condition. Furthermore, plasma normetanephrine (NMET) was higher at half-time (p = .012) and post-CISP (p ≤ .001). Also, plasma metanephrine (MET) was higher post-CISP (p = .009) in the hot compared to temperate condition, reflecting a heightened stress response. Our findings highlight the need for practitioners to consider the detrimental effects heat exposure can have on both physical and decision-making performance when looking to facilitate performance in hot conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4311606526,"The COVID-19 pandemic has strained healthcare systems in many parts of the United States. During the early months of the pandemic, there was substantial uncertainty about whether the large number of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization would exceed healthcare system capacity. This uncertainty created an urgent need to accurately predict the number of COVID-19 patients that would require inpatient and ventilator care at the local level. As the pandemic progressed, many healthcare systems relied on such predictions to prepare for COVID-19 surges and to make decisions regarding staffing, the discontinuation of elective procedures, and the amount of personal protective equipment (PPE) to purchase. In this work, we develop a Bayesian Susceptible-Infectious-Hospitalized-Ventilated-Recovered (SIHVR) model to predict the burden of COVID-19 at the healthcare system level. The Bayesian SIHVR model provides daily estimates of the number of new COVID-19 patients admitted to inpatient care, the total number of non-ventilated COVID-19 inpatients, and the total number of ventilated COVID-19 patients at the healthcare system level. The model also incorporates county-level data on the number of reported COVID-19 cases, and county-level social distancing metrics, making it locally customizable. The uncertainty in model predictions is quantified with 95% credible intervals. The Bayesian SIHVR model is validated with an extensive simulation study, and then applied to data from two regional healthcare systems in South Carolina. This model can be adapted for other healthcare systems to estimate local resource needs."

Patient demographics, comorbidities, medical history, the severity of acute limb ischemia (ALI), preoperative medication regimen, embolus/thrombus localization, procedural data, in-hospital complications/adverse events and their related interventions, and 30-day mortality were reviewed in electronic medical records. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test; in addition, univariate and multivariate logistic regression was conducted.The embolus/thrombus was localized to the upper limb in 134 patients (38.6%) and the lower limb in 213 patients (61.4%). The median length of hospital stay was 3.8 days (IQR, 2.1-6.6 days). The in-hospital major amputation rates for the upper limb, lower limb, and total patient population were 2.2%, 14.1%, and 9.5%, respectively, and the in-hospital plus 30-day mortality rates were 4.5%, 9.4%, and 7.5%, respectively. In patients with lower limb embolectomy, the predictor of in-hospital major amputation was the time between the onset of symptoms and embolectomy (OR, 1.78), while the predictor of in-hospital plus 30-day mortality was previous stroke (OR, 7.16). In the overall patient cohort, there were two predictors of in-hospital major amputation: 1) the time between the onset of symptoms and embolectomy (OR, 1.92) and 2) compartment syndrome (OR, 3.51).Amputation and mortality rates after surgical embolectomies in patients with ALI are high. Patients with prolonged admission time, compartment syndrome, and history of stroke are at increased risk of limb loss or death. To avoid amputation and death, patients with ALI should undergo surgical intervention as soon as possible and receive close monitoring in the peri- and postprocedural periods."
https://openalex.org/W4311606623,"Large slice thickness or slice increment causes information insufficiency of Computed Tomography (CT) data in the longitudinal direction, which degrades the quality of CT-based diagnosis. Traditional approaches such as high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and linear interpolation can solve this problem. However, HRCT suffers from dose increase, and linear interpolation causes artifacts. In this study, we propose a deep-learning-based approach to reconstruct densely sliced CT from sparsely sliced CT data without any dose increase. The proposed method reconstructs CT images from neighboring slices using a U-net architecture. To prevent multiple reconstructed slices from influencing one another, we propose a parallel architecture in which multiple U-net architectures work independently. Moreover, for a specific organ (i.e., the liver), we propose a range-clip technique to improve reconstruction quality, which enhances the learning of CT values within this organ by enlarging the range of the training data. CT data from 130 patients were collected, with 80% used for training and the remaining 20% used for testing. Experiments showed that our parallel U-net architecture reduced the mean absolute error of CT values in the reconstructed slices by 22.05%, and also reduced the incidence of artifacts around the boundaries of target organs, compared with linear interpolation. Further improvements of 15.12%, 11.04%, 10.94%, and 10.63% were achieved for the liver, left kidney, right kidney, and stomach, respectively, using the proposed range-clip algorithm. Also, we compared the proposed architecture with original U-net method, and the experimental results demonstrated the superiority of our approach."
https://openalex.org/W4311606627,"Different levels of resistance against Rhizopus oryzae infection have been observed between inbred (BALB/c) and outbred (Swiss) mice and are associated with the genetic background of each mouse strain. Considering that macrophages play an important role in host resistance to Rhizopus species, we used different infectious outcomes observed in experimental mucormycosis to identify the most efficient macrophage response pattern against R . oryzae in vitro and in vivo . For this, we compared BALB/c and Swiss macrophage activity before and after intravenous or intratracheal R . oryzae infections. The production of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and nitric oxide (NO) was determined in cultures of peritoneal (PMΦ) or alveolar macrophages (AMΦ) challenged with heat-killed spores of R . oryzae . The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were measured to confirm our findings. Naïve PMΦ from female BALB/c mice showed increased production of H 2 O 2 , TNF-α, and IL-10 in the presence of heat-killed spores of R . oryzae . Naïve PMΦ from female Swiss mice were less responsive. Naïve AMΦ from the two strains of female mice were less reactive to heat-killed spores of R . oryzae than PMΦ. After 30 days of R . oryzae intravenous infection, lower fungal load in spleen from BALB/c mice was accompanied by higher production of H 2 O 2 by PMΦ compared with Swiss mice. In contrast, AMΦ from BALB/c mice showed higher production of NO, TNF-α, and IL-10 after 7 days of intratracheal infection. The collective findings reveal that, independent of the female mouse strain, PMΦ is more reactive against R . oryzae upon first contact than AMΦ. In addition, increased PMΦ production of H 2 O 2 at the end of disseminated infection is accompanied by better fungal clearance in resistant (BALB/c) mice. Our findings further the understanding of the parasite–host relationship in mucormycosis."
https://openalex.org/W4311606919,"In survey research, various types of estimators have been suggested that consider only the current sample information to compute the unknown population parameters. Therefore, we utilize the past sample information along with the current sample information in the form of hybrid exponentially weighted moving averages to suggest the memory type logarithmic estimators for time-based surveys. The expression of the mean square error of the suggested estimators is determined to the first order of approximation. A relative comparison of the suggested estimators with the existing estimators is performed and efficiency conditions are obtained. Further, a simulation study is accomplished using a hypothetically rendered population and a real data illustration to improve the theoretical results. The results of the simulation study and the real data application exhibit that the consideration of past and current sample information meliorates the efficiency of the suggested estimators."
