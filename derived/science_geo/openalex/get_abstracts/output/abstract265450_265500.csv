https://openalex.org/W1674702227,"The preliminary characterization of the rocks and soils returned from the Apollo 16 site has substantiated the inference that the lunar terra are commonly underlain by plagioclase-rich or anorthositic rocks. No evidence has been found for volcanic rocks underlying the regolith in the Apollo 16 region. In their place, we have found anorthositic rocks that are thoroughly modified by crushing and partial melting. The textural and chemical variations in these rocks provide some evidence for the existence of anorthositic complexes that have differentiated on a scale of tens to hundreds of meters. The occurrence of deep-seated or plutonic rocks in place of volcanic or pyroclastic materials at this site suggests that the inference from physiographic evidence that the latter materials are widespread in terra regions may be incorrect. Several additional, more specific conclusions derived from this preliminary examination are: 1) The combination of data from the Descartes region with data from the orbital x-ray fluorescence experiment indicates that some backside, highland regions are underlain by materials that consist of more than 80 percent plagioclase. 2) The soil or upper regolith between North Ray and South Ray has not been completely homogenized since the time of formation of these craters. 3) The chemistry of the soil indicates that rocks rich in potassium, uranium, and thorium, similar to those that prevail at the Fra Mauro site, are relatively abundant (10 to 20 percent) in the Descartes region. 4) The K/U ratio of the lunar crust is similar to that of the KREEP basalts. 5) The carbon content of the premare lunar crust is even lower than that of the mare volcanic rocks."

Carbon-14 dates for stratum II, in which the earliest beans were found, range from 7,680 +/- 280 to 10,000 +/- 300 years before the present."
https://openalex.org/W1971340657,"A spinel troctolite and an anorthosite from the Apollo 16 landing site represent contrasting types of ""primitive"" lunar cumulates. The two rock types probably formed from the same parent magma type, a high-alumina magnesian basalt, with the troctolite forming earlier by crystal settling, and the anorthosite later, possibly by flotation."
https://openalex.org/W2115981556,"A subsurface Apollo 16 soil, 61221, is much richer in volatile compounds than soils from any other locations or sites as shown by thermal analysis-gas release measurements. A weight loss of 0.03 percent during the interval 175 degrees to 350 degrees C was associated with the release of water, carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen, and minor amounts of hydrocarbons and other species. These volatile components may have been brought to this site by a comet, which may have formed North Ray crater."

https://openalex.org/W1858882107,"The Cayley Plains at the Apollo 16 landing site consist of crudely stratified breccias to a depth of at least 200 meters, overlain by a regolith 10 to 15 meters thick. Samples, photographs, and observations by the astronauts indicate that most of the rocks are impact breccias derived from an anorthositegabbro complex. The least brecciated members of the suite include coarse-grained anorthosite and finer-grained, more mafic rocks, some with igneous and some with metamorphic textures. Much of the traverse area is covered by ejecta from North Ray and South Ray craters, but the abundance of rock fragments increases to the south toward the younger South Ray crater. The Descartes highlands, a distinct morphologic entity, differ from the adjacent Cayley formation more in physiographic expression than in lithologic character."

Some of the areas in which the Chinese have excelled in the face of handicaps are biological sciences studies of the incidence and etiology of cancer and molecular biology. In the physical sciences and computer technology they are behind. Areas with practical applications are given priority e.g. in geophysics special attention is given to earthquake prediction in chemistry petrochemicals form an area of concentration and in physics lasers and solid-state devices receive special attention. There is a big production of steroid contraceptive drugs some of which are exported. The Chinese lack experience in integrating advanced research and development into major industrial complexes and have no good mechanisms for transferring knowledge from the physical sciences to industry. Modernizing China will be a costly task and the problems foreseen are numerous. Progress over the past 30 years has however been considerable.

These components are predominantly anorthositic, with the exception of a cryptocrystalline clast found in the microbreccia portion of 63335,14 which contains 2.7 percent potassium oxide and 66.7 percent silicon dioxide. The samples have been subjected to extreme shock and thermal metamorphism. The parent materials of the microbreccias include both a coarse-grained anorthosite and a fine-grained subophitic anorthositic gabbro."

https://openalex.org/W2080271592,China seems to be a nation of people who work hard 6 days a week; who live ordered lives. On Sunday Heroes Square is filled with quiet regiments of people who visit the mausoleum of Chairman Mao; once outside they visit shops. They take pleasure in books radiomuseums the arts and the movies. The curriculum at a middle school includes courses in literature mathematics chemistry physics foreign languages biology music Chinese history and physical education. A relaxation period is provided to allow time to massage the eyes to relieve eye tension. Kindergarten children ages 3-6 years live at school 6 days a week. The atmosphere in their schools is ordered and controlled. Some of the people who hold key positions in research institutes have attended U.S. universities; these people feel optimistic about future growth. The research institutes and laboratories are unheated and poorly lit but still offer a mood of seriousness and hard work. As research and technology were discouraged from the mid-1960s to mid-1970s the current state of technology is generally ruinous. Thus modernization presents such problems as: 1) pressure for leaps in industrial advancement will be great; 2) foreign language instruction must be expanded; 3) management skills for quality control are lacking; and 4) restructuring of the economy will cause social problems. Understanding these potential problems has encouraged the Chinese to desire improvement of their educational system and to establish cultural exchange programs with other countries including the U.S.

https://openalex.org/W2151943947,The contradictions in China may be suited to the yin yang philosophy but they could lead the United States into a situation similar to that faced in Iran. Foreign investors scientists and educators are being imported and an intense shift to energy and capital-based technology is being encouraged in the struggle for modernization. The headlong rush to modernization coupled with a desire for protection from Soviet hegemony will impose a new system of values upon an entrenched society with strong traditions of collectivism and a labor-based economy. What will happen when computers replace people in a country with an extremely large population? China has no anthropologists or sociologists to consider future repercussions from adaptation to entreprenuerial industrialization and/or Western enculturation. Managers and planners are needed. Institutions originally designed according to Soviet bureaucratic structures are being reinforced rather than redesigned. Communication of precise scientific and engineering terms is difficult in Chinese. A Chinese contradiction can be found in medicine where doctors emphasize the sensational: they can reattach severed arms when what they need most is an effective public health program.
