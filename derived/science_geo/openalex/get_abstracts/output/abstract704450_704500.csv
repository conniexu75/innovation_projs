https://openalex.org/W4309335570,"Dendritic spines can be directly connected to both inhibitory and excitatory presynaptic terminals, resulting in nanometer-scale proximity of opposing synaptic functions. While dually innervated spines (DiSs) are observed throughout the central nervous system, their developmental timeline and functional properties remain uncharacterized. Here we used a combination of serial section electron microscopy, live imaging, and local synapse activity manipulations to investigate DiS development and function in rodent hippocampus. Dual innervation occurred early in development, even on spines where the excitatory input was locally silenced. Synaptic NMDA receptor currents were selectively reduced at DiSs through tonic GABAB receptor signaling. Accordingly, spine enlargement normally associated with long-term potentiation on singly innervated spines (SiSs) was blocked at DiSs. Silencing somatostatin interneurons or pharmacologically blocking GABABRs restored NMDA receptor function and structural plasticity to levels comparable to neighboring SiSs. Thus, hippocampal DiSs are stable structures where function and plasticity are potently regulated by nanometer-scale GABAergic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4309022350,"Cholesterol is a major and essential component of the mammalian cell plasma membrane (PM), and the loss of cholesterol homeostasis leads to various pathologies. Cellular cholesterol uptake and synthesis are regulated by a cholesterol sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, it remains unclear how changes in the cholesterol level of the PM are recognized. Here, we show that the sensing of cholesterol in the PM depends on ABCA1 and the cholesterol transfer protein Aster-A, which cooperatively maintain the asymmetric transbilayer cholesterol distribution in the PM. We demonstrate that ABCA1 translocates (flops) cholesterol from the inner leaflet of the PM to the outer leaflet of the PM to maintain a low inner leaflet cholesterol level. We also found that when inner cholesterol levels were increased, Aster-A was recruited to the PM-ER contact site to transfer cholesterol to the ER. These results suggest that ABCA1 could promote an asymmetric cholesterol distribution to suppress Aster-A recruitment to the PM-ER contact site to maintain intracellular cholesterol homeostasis."

Calmodulin (CaM) governs CaV1.2 open probability (Po) and Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we present electrophysiological data that identify a half Ca2+-saturated CaM species (Ca2/CaM) with Ca2+ bound solely at the third and fourth EF-hands (EF3 and EF4) under resting Ca2+ concentrations (50–100 nM) that constitutively preassociates with CaV1.2 to promote Po and CDI. We also present an NMR structure of a complex between the CaV1.2 IQ motif (residues 1644–1665) and Ca2/CaM12’, a calmodulin mutant in which Ca2+ binding to EF1 and EF2 is completely disabled. We found that the CaM12’ N-lobe does not interact with the IQ motif. The CaM12’ C-lobe bound two Ca2+ ions and formed close contacts with IQ residues I1654 and Y1657. I1654A and Y1657D mutations impaired CaM binding, CDI, and Po, as did disabling Ca2+ binding to EF3 and EF4 in the CaM34 mutant when compared to WT CaM. Accordingly, a previously unappreciated Ca2/CaM species promotes CaV1.2 Po and CDI, identifying Ca2/CaM as an important mediator of Ca signaling.

Thus, defining mechanisms of CaV1.2 regulation is highly relevant for understanding its physiological and pathological functions. Ca2+ influx through CaV1.2 triggers a rapid negative feedback mechanism by inducing channel inactivation called Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) (8Peterson B. DeMaria C. Adelman J. Yue D.

However, under physiological conditions, apoCaM binds to the isolated CaV1.2 IQ-motif with a dissociation constant (KD) of ∼10 μM (14Evans T.I. Hell J.W.

The concentration of free apoCaM is <100 nM in neurons and cardiomyocytes (15Turner M. Anderson D.E. Nieves-Cintron M. Bartels P. Coleman A.M.

Free and bound intracellular calmodulin measurements in cardiac myocytes.Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the fractional binding of CaV1.2 to apoCaM is predicted to be less than 10% and may not be the prevalent CaM species bound to CaV1.2 or the closely related CaV1.3 under basal conditions as proposed previously (12Findeisen F. Rumpf C.H. Minor Jr., D.L. Apo states of calmodulin and CaBP1 control CaV1 voltage-gated calcium channel function through direct competition for the IQ domain.J. Mol.

To fill a critical gap in our understanding of how CaM governs CaV1.2 function, we used NMR structural analysis, protein biochemistry, and patch-clamp electrophysiology of WT and mutated CaV1.2 bound to CaM. Our studies uncovered a half-calcified form of CaM (with Ca2+ bound solely at EF3 and EF4, called Ca2/CaM) that is functionally preassociated with CaV1.2 under basal conditions. The NMR structure of Ca2/CaM bound to the CaV1.2 IQ-motif (residues 1644–1664) suggests that the Ca2+-bound CaM C-lobe (residues F93, M110, L113, M125) forms intermolecular interactions with the side chain atoms from CaV1.2 residues (Y1649, I1654, Y1657, and F1658), whereas the Ca2+-free CaM N-lobe does not interact with the IQ motif. Electrophysiological data of key mutants of CaV1.2 (I1654A and Y1657E) contrasted with the earlier findings for the K1662E mutant along with the consequences of ectopic expression of CaM34 all suggest that Ca2/CaM, rather than apoCaM, preassociates with CaV1.2 under basal conditions to augment channel open probability (Po) and mediate rapid CDI. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies have suggested that apoCaM binds to the IQ peptide with submicromolar affinity in the absence of salt (12Findeisen F. Rumpf C.H. Minor Jr., D.L. Apo states of calmodulin and CaBP1 control CaV1 voltage-gated calcium channel function through direct competition for the IQ domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 3217-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of physiological salt levels, apoCaM binds to the CaV1.2 IQ-motif with a dissociation constant (KD) of 10 μM (14Evans T.I. Hell J.W. Shea M.A. Thermodynamic linkage between calmodulin domains binding calcium and contiguous sites in the C-terminal tail of Ca(V)1.2.Biophys.

Yarov V. et al.a-Actinin-1 promotes gating of the L-type Ca2+ Channel CaV1.2.EMBO J. 2020; 39e102622Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Earlier work suggests that binding of apoCaM to full-length CaV1.2 is ∼10 times stronger than binding to the IQ segment (11Erickson M.G. Liang H. Mori M.X. Yue D.T. FRET two-hybrid mapping reveals function and location of L-type Ca2+ channel CaM preassociation.Neuron. 2003; 39: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that apoCaM binds to full-length CaV1.2 with a KD of ∼1 μM, which is outside the physiological concentration range of free CaM (<100 nM) in neurons and cardiomyocytes (15Turner M. Anderson D.E. Nieves-Cintron M. Bartels P. Coleman A.M. Yarov V. et al.a-Actinin-1 promotes gating of the L-type Ca2+ Channel CaV1.2.EMBO J. 2020; 39e102622Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 16Wu X. Bers D.M. Free and bound intracellular calmodulin measurements in cardiac myocytes.Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), implying low fractional binding. Furthermore, the recent NMR structure of apoCaM bound to the CaV1.2 IQ-motif revealed an intermolecular salt bridge involving CaV1.2 residue K1662, and the K1662E mutation significantly and selectively weakened apoCaM binding to CaV1.2 (15Turner M. Anderson D.E. Nieves-Cintron M. Bartels P. Coleman A.M. Yarov V. et al.a-Actinin-1 promotes gating of the L-type Ca2+ Channel CaV1.2.EMBO J. 2020; 39e102622Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). At the same time, the K1662E mutation does not affect single-channel Po (15Turner M. Anderson D.E. Nieves-Cintron M. Bartels P. Coleman A.M. Yarov V. et al.a-Actinin-1 promotes gating of the L-type Ca2+ Channel CaV1.2.EMBO J. 2020; 39e102622Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These previous results suggest that apoCaM may not be the main CaM species to support CaV1.2 activity under basal conditions as proposed previously (12Findeisen F. Rumpf C.H. Minor Jr., D.L. Apo states of calmodulin and CaBP1 control CaV1 voltage-gated calcium channel function through direct competition for the IQ domain.J. Mol.

The current study tested the hypothesis that the CaV1.2 channel may preassociate mostly with a CaM species that is half saturated with Ca2+ under basal Ca2+ conditions ([Ca2+]i = 100 nM). In support of our hypothesis, we find that IQ binding to CaM causes a more than 10-fold increase in the apparent Ca2+ affinity, which allows Ca2+ to bind to the CaM C-lobe under basal conditions (Fig. S1). On the basis of previous binding data (14Evans T.I. Hell J.W. Shea M.A. Thermodynamic linkage between calmodulin domains binding calcium and contiguous sites in the C-terminal tail of Ca(V)1.2.Biophys. Chem. 2011; 159: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Gilli R. Lafitte D. Lopez C. Kilhoffer M. Makarov A. Briand C. et al.Thermodynamic analysis of calcium and magnesium binding to calmodulin.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5450-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the C-lobe under basal conditions is predicted to bind two Ca2+ to form a half-calcified state (called Ca2/CaM) in which the N-lobe is devoid of Ca2+ (19Ames J.B. L-type Ca(2+) channel regulation by calmodulin and CaBP1.Biomolecules. 2021; 11: 1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Indeed, the C-lobe binds Ca2+ as well as the IQ motif with 10-fold higher affinity than the N-lobe (14Evans T.I. Hell J.W. Shea M.A. Thermodynamic linkage between calmodulin domains binding calcium and contiguous sites in the C-terminal tail of Ca(V)1.2.Biophys.

Briand C. et al.Thermodynamic analysis of calcium and magnesium binding to calmodulin.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5450-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Using the binding constants from (14Evans T.I. Hell J.W. Shea M.A. Thermodynamic linkage between calmodulin domains binding calcium and contiguous sites in the C-terminal tail of Ca(V)1.2.Biophys. Chem. 2011; 159: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Gilli R. Lafitte D. Lopez C. Kilhoffer M. Makarov A. Briand C. et al.Thermodynamic analysis of calcium and magnesium binding to calmodulin.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5450-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) the relative concentrations of apoCaM, CaM intermediate (Ca2/CaM), and Ca2+-saturated CaM (Ca4/CaM) each bound to the IQ as a function of free Ca2+ concentration are shown in Fig. S1A. The Ca2/CaM intermediate species (red trace in Fig. S1A) has a significant occupancy of ∼50% at 100 nM Ca2+ concentration (basal Ca2+ level). Since the apoCaM N-lobe (CaMN) does not bind to IQ under physiological conditions (14Evans T.I. Hell J.W. Shea M.A. Thermodynamic linkage between calmodulin domains binding calcium and contiguous sites in the C-terminal tail of Ca(V)1.2.Biophys. Chem. 2011; 159: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), IQ must instead be bound to the C-lobe (CaMC) of Ca2/CaM. Using binding constants from (14Evans T.I. Hell J.W. Shea M.A. Thermodynamic linkage between calmodulin domains binding calcium and contiguous sites in the C-terminal tail of Ca(V)1.2.Biophys. Chem. 2011; 159: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Gilli R. Lafitte D. Lopez C. Kilhoffer M. Makarov A. Briand C. et al.Thermodynamic analysis of calcium and magnesium binding to calmodulin.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5450-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we calculate that CaMC-IQ (Fig. 1) and CaMN-IQ (Fig. 2) have apparent KD values for Ca2+ binding of 100 nM and 1.0 μM, respectively:Figure 2Apparent Ca2+-binding affinity of the CaM N-lobe bound to IQ (CaMN-IQ).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thus, the CaM C-lobe is calculated to have a 10-fold higher apparent Ca2+ affinity compared to CaM N-lobe. This calculation implies that ∼50% of CaM-IQ complex will have Ca2+ bound to its C-lobe under basal conditions ([Ca2+]i = 100 nM), whereas the N-lobe should be devoid of Ca2+. To test this prediction, we prepared a CaM mutant (D21A/D23A/D25A/E32Q/D57A/D59A/N61A/E68Q, called CaM12’) that completely disabled Ca2+ binding to EF1 and EF2 but retained normal Ca2+ binding to EF3 and EF4. The apparent Ca2+ affinity of CaM12’ in the presence of saturating IQ peptide under physiological conditions (27 °C and 37 °C) was measured by ITC (Fig. 3, A and B). The ITC isotherm at 27 °C is biphasic, suggesting possible sample heterogeneity. The major binding component (N2 = 1.7 ±0.3 Ca2+/protein; Table 1) represents binding of two Ca2+ to CaM12’-IQ as defined by K2, ΔH2, and N2 (Table 1). The other isotherm component is nonstoichiometric (N1 = 0.2 ±0.1 Ca2+/protein) and may be an artifact of IQ partial self-association or other sample heterogeneity. Fitting the ITC isotherm with a two-site model reveals a Ca2+-binding apparent KD (KDapp) of 60 ± 20 nM (Table 1), which agrees within experimental error with the predicted value in Figure 1 and with previously measured values of KDapp obtained by UV fluorescence (20Halling D.B. Georgiou D.K. Black D.J. Yang G. Fallon J.L. Quiocho F.A. et al.Determinants in CaV1 channels that regulate the Ca2+ sensitivity of bound calmodulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20041-20051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-binding ITC isotherm became monophasic at 37 °C, which more accurately demonstrates that two Ca2+ bind to CaM12’ with a KDapp of 72 ± 20 nM and ΔH = -7.7 ± 1 kcal/mol (Fig. 3B and Table 1). The relatively high apparent Ca2+ affinity (KDapp=72nMat37°C) implies that at least 50% of the CaM/IQ complex will have Ca2+ bound to EF3 and EF4 (Y=[Ca2+][Ca2+]+KD) at basal Ca2+concentrations (∼100 nM). This analysis predicts that slightly more than half of the CaV1.2 channels should be preassociated with the CaM intermediate, Ca2/CaM, under basal conditions.Table 2NMR structural statistics for Ca2/CaM12’-IQNMR restraintsValue (restraint violation)Short-range NOEs327 (0.0 ± 0.0)Long-range NOEs172 (0.0 ± 0.0)Hydrogen bonds81 (not used in water refinement)Dihedral angles187 (0.1 ± 0.3)1DHN RDC24 (0.0 ± 0.0)RDC Q-factor0.292Coordinate precision (Å)aCoordinate precision was calculated for C-lobe residues 85 to 149.RMSD backbone atoms0.83 ± 0.09RMSD all heavy atoms1.56 ± 0.1Deviation from idealized geometryBonds (Å)0.007 ± 0.000Angles (°)0.753 ± 0.012Impropers (°)0.927 ± 0.029Ramachandran Plot (%)Favored region75.0Allowed region19.0Outlier region7.0Structure qualitybStructure quality metrics assessed by MolProbity (51).Clash score24Ramachandran outliers6.6%Side chain outliers16.3%a Coordinate precision was calculated for C-lobe residues 85 to 149.b Structure quality metrics assessed by MolProbity (51Chen V.B.

Open table in a new tab The concentration profiles in Fig. S1A show that half saturated CaM (Ca2/CaM) coexists in an equilibrium mixture with apoCaM and Ca2+-saturated CaM (Ca4/CaM). At a basal Ca2+ concentration of 100 nM, the fractional occupancy of Ca2/CaM is calculated to be 55% compared to 7% occupancy of Ca4/CaM and 38% occupancy of apoCaM. Therefore, under basal conditions, Ca2/CaM cannot be resolved from the other CaM species. To isolate the half Ca2+ saturated species, we performed structural studies on the CaM mutant (D21A/D23A/D25A/E32Q/D57A/D59A/N61A/E68Q, called CaM12’) that completely disables Ca2+ binding to EF1 and EF2 but retains Ca2+ binding to EF3 and EF4. The NMR assignments of Ca2+-bound CaM12’ bound to the IQ peptide (Ca2/CaM12’-IQ) reveal two downfield NMR peaks assigned to G99 (EF3) and G135 (EF4) that indicate Ca2+ is bound to EF3 and EF4 (21Salveson I. Anderson D.E. Hell J.W. Ames J.B. Chemical shift assignments of a calmodulin intermediate with two Ca2+ bound in complex with the IQ-motif of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (CaV1.2).Biomol. NMR Assign. 2019; 13: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The corresponding Gly residues in EF1 (G26) and EF2 (G62) do not exhibit downfield amide resonances, indicating that EF1 and EF2 in Ca2/CaM12’-IQ are both devoid of Ca2+. The NMR spectrum of Ca2/CaM12’-IQ is a hybrid of the spectra of Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free CaM (Fig. 4, A and B). The chemical shifts assigned to the CaM12’ C-lobe (residues 80–149) of Ca2/CaM12’-IQ (peaks labeled red in Fig. 4A) are nearly identical to those of the isolated Ca2+-bound CaM C-lobe bound to IQ (blue peaks in Fig. 4A). NMR peaks assigned to CaM12’ N-lobe (residues 1–79) of Ca2/CaM12’-IQ are similar to those of apoCaM12’ in the absence of IQ (black peaks in Fig. 4B), indicating that the CaM12’ N-lobe is Ca2+ free and does not interact with the IQ peptide. Thus, only the C-lobe, but not N-lobe, residues in Ca2/CaM12’ exhibit IQ-induced spectral shifts. NMR spectral assignments for Ca2/CaM12’-IQ were reported previously (BMRB accession number 27692) (21Salveson I. Anderson D.E. Hell J.W. Ames J.B.

These previous NMR assignments were used in the current study to obtain NMR-derived structural restraints from NOESY and residual dipolar coupling (RDC) data (Fig. S4). NMR structures of Ca2/CaM12’-IQ were then calculated on the basis of distance restraints derived from analysis of NOESY (22Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M.

The final NMR-derived structures of Ca2/CaM12’ are overlaid in Figure 4C and structural statistics summarized in Table 2. The two domains of Ca2/CaM12’ (N-lobe in pink and C-lobe in red, Fig. 4C) are separately folded and noninteracting, as was seen previously for the NMR structures of apoCaM (24Finn B.E. Evenas J.

The overall precision of the NMR ensemble is expressed by a RMSD of 0.83 ± 0.09 Å calculated from the coordinates of the main chain atoms in the C-lobe (Fig. 4C) and 0.9 ± 0.1 Å from the main chain atoms in the N-lobe. The lowest energy NMR structure of Ca2/CaM12’ bound to the IQ peptide is shown in Figure 4D. The quality of the NMR structures of Ca2/CaM12’-IQ was assessed using PROCHECK-NMR (27Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. AQUA and PROCHECK-NMR: programs for checking the quality of protein structures solved by NMR.J. Biomol.

The NMR structure of the Ca2+-bound CaM C-lobe (residues 80–149) of Ca2/CaM12’-IQ (dark red in Fig. 4, D and E) looks similar to that observed in the crystal structure of Ca2+-saturated CaM bound to the IQ (cyan in Fig. 4E) (28Van Petegem F. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L. Insights into voltage-gated calcium channel regulation from the structure of the CaV1.2 IQ domain-Ca2+/calmodulin complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The structure of the Ca2+-free CaM N-lobe (residues 1–78) of Ca2/CaM12’-IQ (light red in Fig. 4D) adopts a closed conformation and looks similar to that of apoCaM (26Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Calcium-induced conformational transition revealed by the solution structures of apo calmodulin.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The IQ peptide was verified by NMR to have a helical conformation (cyan in Fig. 4D). In the Ca2/CaM12’-IQ structure (Fig. 4D), the IQ residues (Y1649, I1654, Y1657, and F1658) point toward CaM and make extensive contacts with CaM C-lobe residues (E85, A89, F93, M110, L113, M125). The IQ peptide in the Ca2/CaM12’-IQ structure does not make any contacts with the Ca2+-free N-lobe, in contrast to the crystal structure of Ca4/CaM12’-IQ (28Van Petegem F. Chatelain F.C.

In the apoCaM-IQ structure, K1662 forms intermolecular salt bridges with CaM residues, E85 and E88. By contrast, K1662 is mostly solvent exposed in the Ca2/CaM12’-IQ structure and does not contact either E85 or E88 (Fig. 4D). This analysis predicts that the CaV1.2 mutation K1662E weakens binding to apoCaM more than it does to Ca2/CaM12’. Because the K1662E peptide (IQK1662E) was not soluble enough for ITC with Ca2/CaM12’, we used fluorescence polarization (FP) to measure binding affinity in the nanomolar range. As predicted, titration of the IQ peptides with Ca2/CaM12’ reached full saturation at 100 nM Ca2/CaM12’, indicating a KD < 100 nM for both, IQWT and IQK1662E (Fig. 4F). It was not possible to more accurately determine the actual KD because the IQ peptide concentration in Figure 4F had to be 100 nM due to limited detection sensitivity. This concentration is much larger than the KD for IQWT (16 nM in Table 3) and apparently also for IQK1662E, as binding was clearly saturated at 100 nM for both peptides. The free concentrations of Ca2/CaM12’ ([Ca2/CaM12′]free=[Ca2/CaM12′]total−[IQ]×(fractionalsaturation)) are within the sample noise level during the first half of the titration when [Ca2/CaM12′]free<100nM (see SD bars in Fig. 4F). During the second half of the titration, [Ca2/CaM12′]free was above the noise level and the titration curves show clear saturation at 100 nM providing an upper limit of 100 nM for the KD of both, IQWT and IQK1662E, consistent with the 16 nM KD for IQWT as seen by ITC (Table 3). As a result, Ca2/CaM12’ can bind to IQK1662E in the nanomolar range in contrast to apoCaM, which binds to IQK1662E with a KD in the high micromolar range (60 μM) that is 6-fold higher than that of IQWT"

https://openalex.org/W4308980338,"During prolonged mitotic arrest induced by antimicrotubule drugs, cell fate decision is determined by two alternative pathways, one leading to cell death and the other inducing premature escape from mitosis by mitotic slippage. FBWX7, a member of the F-box family of proteins and substrate-targeting subunit of the SKP1-CUL1-F-Box E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, promotes mitotic cell death and prevents mitotic slippage, but molecular details underlying these roles for FBWX7 are unclear. In this study, we report that WDR5 (WD-repeat containing protein 5), a component of the mixed lineage leukemia complex of histone 3 lysine 4 methyltransferases, is a substrate of FBXW7. We determined by coimmunoprecipitation experiments and in vitro binding assays that WDR5 interacts with FBXW7 in vivo and in vitro. SKP1-CUL1-F-Box-FBXW7 mediates ubiquitination of WDR5 and targets it for proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, we find that WDR5 depletion counteracts FBXW7 loss of function by reducing mitotic slippage and polyploidization. In conclusion, our data elucidate a new mechanism in mitotic cell fate regulation, which might contribute to prevent chemotherapy resistance in patients after antimicrotubule drug treatment."

The vaccination campaign started December 27th 2020 in Italy, together with most countries in the European Union. Social media platforms can offer relevant information about how citizens have experienced and perceived the availability of vaccines and the start of the vaccination campaign. This study aims to use machine learning methods to extract sentiments and topics relating to COVID-19 vaccination from Twitter. Between February and May 2021, we collected over 71,000 tweets containing vaccines-related keywords from Italian Twitter users. To get the dominant sentiment throughout the Italian population, spatial and temporal sentiment analysis was performed using VADER, highlighting sentiment fluctuations strongly influenced by news of vaccines' side effects. Additionally, we investigated the opinions of Italians with respect to different vaccine brands. As a result, 'Oxford-AstraZeneca' vaccine was the least appreciated among people. The application of the Dynamic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (DLDA) model revealed three fundamental topics, which remained stable over time: vaccination plan info, usefulness of vaccinating and concerns about vaccines (risks, side effects and safety). To the best of our current knowledge, this one the first study on Twitter to identify opinions about COVID-19 vaccination in Italy and their progression over the first months of the vaccination campaign. Our results can help policymakers and research communities track public attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines and help them make decisions to promote the vaccination campaign."

Aim at the problem that the simulation methods commonly used in the development of electric tractor drive system are poorly generalized and cannot meet the simulation needs of complex multi-domain physical systems. This paper proposes a modeling method for an electric tractor drive system, takes the YTO-500 tractor as the research object, designs and calculates the overall scheme and parameters of its drive system, divides the drive system into modules, establishes the energy system, motor system and mechanical parts model based on Modelica, and integrates the simulation model of electric tractor drive system on this basis. The traction performance and transportation working conditions were simulated and tested. With compared and analyzed, in the traction characteristics, the simulation and test results of maximum speed, maximum traction force, and maximum traction power of each gear are consistent; within 400s transportation simulation conditions, the speed range of electric tractor is 13~28km·h -1 , which is consistent with the speed range of electric tractor transportation gear. The results show that the simulation and the test results are consistent, which verifies the credibility of the simulation and the correctness of the model built, providing a basis for future research and development of agricultural machinery."

This study focuses on vaccine hesitancy and means of reducing it. Data come from a large, representative phone survey and online randomized survey experiment, both run in Papua New Guinea, a developing country with low vaccination rates. Less than 20% of relevant respondents to the phone survey were willing to be vaccinated, primarily because of fear of side effects and low trust in the vaccine. Although vaccine hesitancy was high in the online experiment, participants who received a message emphasizing that the vaccine was safe and COVID-19 dangerous were 68% more likely to state they planned to be vaccinated than those in the control group. A message appealing to social norms was also effective in reducing vaccine hesitancy, although its efficacy was limited to certain types of people."

The impact of environmental chemical exposures during daily life on neurodevelopmental outcomes in toddlers with congenital heart defects is unknown.This prospective study investigated the impacts of early childhood exposure to mixtures of environmental chemicals on neurodevelopmental outcomes after cardiac surgery. Outcomes were assessed at 18 months of age using The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III. Urinary concentrations of exposure biomarkers of pesticides, phenols, parabens, and phthalates, and blood levels of lead, mercury, and nicotine were measured at the same time point. Bayesian profile regression and weighted quantile sum regression were utilized to assess associations between mixtures of biomarkers and neurodevelopmental scores.One-hundred and forty infants were enrolled, and 110 (79%) returned at 18 months of age. Six biomarker exposure clusters were identified from the Bayesian profile regression analysis; and the pattern was driven by 15 of the 30 biomarkers, most notably 13 phthalate biomarkers. Children in the highest exposure cluster had significantly lower adjusted language scores by -9.41 points (95%CI: -17.2, -1.7) and adjusted motor scores by -4.9 points (-9.5, -0.4) compared to the lowest exposure. Weighted quantile sum regression modeling for the overall exposure-response relationship showed a significantly lower adjusted motor score (β = -2.8 points [2.5th and 97.5th percentile: -6.0, -0.6]). The weighted quantile sum regression index weights for several phthalates, one paraben, and one phenol suggest their relevance for poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes.Like other children, infants with congenital heart defects are exposed to complex mixtures of environmental chemicals in daily life. Higher exposure biomarker concentrations were associated with significantly worse performance for language and motor skills in this population."
https://openalex.org/W4309232215,"The purpose of this paper is to explore the spatial heterogeneity of internal migration in China and to discuss the influence of economic, social and environmental characteristics on this demographic process. The overall results suggest that migration in China occurred from inland to coastal areas and from rural areas to urban areas. By stepwise regression, we identified that 9 out of 15 factors with potential influence on internal migration were retained, and the multicollinearity among them was reduced. In addition, we used the OLS and GWR regression analysis to discuss the global and local effects of relevant factors on internal migration. Economic scale (GDP), population concentration (population density) and demographic dividend (labour force proportion) were the three main driving forces of internal migration. In turn, internal migration further widened the gap of economic scale, population agglomeration and demographic dividend between counties and cities. Internal migration in southern coastal areas of China was most affected by economic aspects and demographic dividend. In the central China, the population was more concentrated in high-density cities, while in the eastern regions, areas with high level of education were conducive to immigration, thus forming talent reserve highlands. In the west, areas with highly educated level faced out-migration, which might cause brain drain and widen further the gap in talent reserves between the east and the west in China. From the perspective of location, the net immigration of the provincial capital was accompanied by the net immigration of the surrounding area, which was conducive to the formation of city clusters or urban sprawl. On the other side, the net immigration in prefecture-level cities often meant the net out-migration in surrounding areas. The correlation is particularly strong in eastern coastal provinces."

The intensity of tooth sensitivity was assessed daily through the visual analog scale. The color analysis was performed three times: baseline, 21 days, and 1 month after the last application of the whitening gel. The impact of the oral condition on the patient's quality of life (OIDP) was used to measure the impact caused by the whitening treatment in relation to the individuals' ability to carry out their daily activities and its influence on HRQOL.No difference in tooth sensitivity was observed (p > 0.05). In addition, there was no difference in color change between groups (p > 0.05). However, there was an intragroup statistical difference throughout the evaluation period (p <0.05). The OIDP analysis showed a statistical difference between the groups (p > 0.05) and there was no difference between the groups regarding the degree of satisfaction with the bleaching (p > 0.05).The 1.5% PO was effective in preventing sensitivity and did not interfere with tooth whitening. Desensitizing therapy had a positive impact on quality of life and patient satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W4309263865,"Background Caesarean section has a significant role in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. A linked analysis of population and health facility data is valuable to map and identify caesarean section use and associated factors. This study aimed to identify geographic variation and associated factors of caesarean delivery in Ethiopia. Method Linked data analysis of the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) and the 2014 Ethiopian Service Provision Assessment Plus (ESPA+) survey was performed. Spatial analysis was conducted to identify geographic variations and factors associated with caesarean delivery. Hierarchical Bayesian analysis was also performed to identify factors associated with caesarean delivery using the SAS MCMC procedure. Results Women’s age and education, household wealth, parity, antenatal care (ANC) visits, and distance to caesarean section facility were associated with caesarean delivery use. Women who had ≥4 ANC visits were 4.67 (95% Credible Interval (CrI): 2.17, 9.43) times more likely to have caesarean delivery compared to those who had no ANC visits. Women who had education and were from rich households were also 2.80 (95% CrI: 1.83, 4.19) and 1.80 (95% CrI: 1.08, 2.84) times more likely to have caesarean deliveries relative to women who had no education and were from poor households, respectively. A one-kilometer increase in distance to a caesarean section facility was associated with an 88% reduction in the odds of caesarean delivery (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 0.12, 95% CrI: 0.01, 0.78). Hotspots of high caesarean section rates were observed in Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, and the Harari region. In addition, women’s age at first childbirth and ≥4 ANC visits showed significant spatially varying relations between caesarean delivery use across Ethiopia. Conclusion Caesarean section is a lifesaving procedure, and it is essential to narrow disparities to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality and avoid unnecessary procedures."
https://openalex.org/W4309021765,"HSP90 inhibitors can target many oncoproteins simultaneously, but none have made it through clinical trials due to dose-limiting toxicity and induction of heat shock response, leading to clinical resistance. We identified diptoindonesin G (dip G) as an HSP90 modulator that can promote degradation of HSP90 clients by binding to the middle domain of HSP90 (Kd = 0.13 ± 0.02 μM) without inducing heat shock response. This is likely because dip G does not interfere with the HSP90-HSF1 interaction like N-terminal inhibitors, maintaining HSF1 in a transcriptionally silent state. We found that binding of dip G to HSP90 promotes degradation of HSP90 client protein estrogen receptor α (ER), a major oncogenic driver protein in most breast cancers. Mutations in the ER ligand-binding domain (LBD) are an established mechanism of endocrine resistance and decrease the binding affinity of mainstay endocrine therapies targeting ER, reducing their ability to promote ER degradation or transcriptionally silence ER. Because dip G binds to HSP90 and does not bind to the LBD of ER, unlike endocrine therapies, it is insensitive to ER LBD mutations that drive endocrine resistance. Additionally, we determined that dip G promoted degradation of WT and mutant ER with similar efficacy, downregulated ER- and mutant ER-regulated gene expression, and inhibited WT and mutant cell proliferation. Our data suggest that dip G is not only a molecular probe to study HSP90 biology and the HSP90 conformation cycle, but also a new therapeutic avenue for various cancers, particularly endocrine-resistant breast cancer harboring ER LBD mutations."
https://openalex.org/W4309231580,"Acute pharyngitis (AP) is a common reason for private primary care consultations, thus providing an avenue for widespread antibiotic intake among the community. However, there is limited data on the antibiotic prescription appropriateness and resistance information in the Malaysian private primary care setting, therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of isolated viruses and bacteria, antibiotic resistance patterns, antibiotic prescription patterns and appropriateness by general practitioners (GPs) and factors affecting antibiotic resistance and antibiotic prescription patterns. To investigate, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 205 patients presenting with AP symptoms at private primary care clinics in central Malaysia from 3 rd January 2016 to 30 th November 2016. Throat swabs were collected from 205 AP patients for two purposes: (i) the detection of four common respiratory viruses associated with AP via reverse-transcription real-time PCR (qRT-PCR); and (ii) bacterial identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Bacterial isolates were then subjected to antibiotic susceptibility screening and McIsaac scoring was calculated post-prescription based on GP selection of criteria. Generalized estimating equations analysis with multiple logistic regression was conducted to identify factors associated with presence of virus and antibiotic prescription. The results showed that 95.1% (195/205) of patients had at least one of the four viruses, with rhinovirus (88.5%) being the most prevalent, followed by adenovirus (74.9%), influenza A virus (4.6%) and enterovirus (2.1%). A total of 862 non-repetitive colonies were isolated from the culture of throat swabs from 205 patients who were positive for bacteria. From a total of 22 genera, Streptococcus constitutes the most prevalent bacteria genus (40.9%), followed by Neisseria (20%), Rothia (13.0%), Staphylococcus (11%) and Klebsiella (4.9%). Only 5 patients carried group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS). We also report the presence of vancomycin-resistant S . aureus or VRSA (n = 9, 10.1%) among which one isolate is a multidrug-resistant methicillin-resistant S . aureus (MDR-MRSA), while 54.1% (n = 111) were found to carry at least one antibiotic-resistant bacteria species. Application of the McIsaac scoring system indicated that 87.8% (n = 180) of patients should not be prescribed antibiotics as the majority of AP patients in this study had viral pharyngitis. The antibiotic prescription appropriateness by applying post-prescription McIsaac scoring was able to rule out GABHS pharyngitis in this sample with a GABHS culture-positive sensitivity of 40% (n = 2/5) and specificity of 90% (180/200). In conclusion, antibiotic-resistant throat isolates and over-prescription of antibiotics were observed and McIsaac scoring system is effective in guiding GPs to determine occurrences of viral pharyngitis to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescription."

Prior literature has suggested a link between mobile technology use and lower levels of cognitive control when people engage in a cognitively demanding task. This effect is more evident for people who report higher levels of smartphone use. The current study examined the effects of smartphones notifications on cognitive control and attention. Participants completed the Navon Letter paradigm which paired visual (frequent and rare target letters) and auditory (smartphone and control sounds) stimuli. We found that overall, participants responded slower on trials paired with smartphone notification (vs. control) sounds. They also demonstrated larger overall N2 ERP and a larger N2 oddball effect on trials paired with smartphone (vs. control) sounds, suggesting that people generally exhibited greater levels of cognitive control on the smartphone trials. In addition, people with higher smartphone addiction proneness showed lower P2 ERP on trials with the smartphone (vs. control) sounds, suggesting lower attentional engagement. These results add to the debate on the effects of smartphones on cognition. Limitations and future directions are discussed."

While substantial gains have been made at the primary school level, progress towards universal secondary education has slowed, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we aimed to determine perceived barriers of secondary schooling in rural Burkina Faso, where secondary school completion is among the lowest globally (&lt;10%). We conducted a two-stage qualitative study using semi-structured interviews ( N = 49). In the first stage, we sampled enrolled students (n = 10), out-of-school adolescents (n = 9), parents of enrolled students (n = 5), parents of out-of-school adolescents (n = 5) and teachers (n = 10) from a random sample of five secondary schools. In a second stage, we interviewed key informants knowledgeable of the school context using snowball sampling (n = 10). Systematic analysis of the pooled sample was based on a reading of interview transcripts and coding of the narratives in NVivo12 using the diathesis-stress model. Recurring themes were classified using a priori developed categories of hypothesized barriers to secondary schooling. Major reported barriers included school-related expenses and the lack of school infrastructure and resources. Insufficient and heterogeneous French language skills (the official language of instruction in Burkina Faso) were seen as a major barrier to secondary schooling. Forced marriages, adolescent pregnancies, and the low perceived economic benefits of investing in secondary schooling were reported as key barriers among young women. Our results guide future interventions and policy aimed at achieving universal secondary education and gender equity in the region."
https://openalex.org/W4309231928,"Phytoplankton release massive amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into the water column during recurring blooms in coastal waters and inland seas. The released DOM encompasses a complex mixture of both known and unknown compounds, and is a rich nutrient source for heterotrophic bacteria. The metabolic activity of bacteria during and after phytoplankton blooms can hence be expected to reflect the characteristics of the released DOM. We therefore investigated if bacterioplankton could be used as ""living sensors"" of phytoplankton DOM quantity and/or quality, by applying gene expression analyses to identify bacterial metabolisms induced by DOM. We used transcriptional analysis of two Baltic Sea bacterial isolates (Polaribacter sp. BAL334 [Flavobacteriia] and Brevundimonas sp. BAL450 [Alphaproteobacteria]) growing with DOM from axenic cultures of the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum. We observed pronounced differences between the two bacteria both in growth and the expressed metabolic pathways in cultures exposed to dinoflagellate DOM compared with controls. Differences in metabolic responses between the two isolates were caused both by differences in gene repertoire between them (e.g. in the SEED categories for membrane transport, motility and photoheterotrophy) and the regulation of expression (e.g. fatty acid metabolism), emphasizing the importance of separating the responses of different taxa in analyses of community sequence data. Similarities between the bacteria included substantially increased expression of genes for Ton and Tol transport systems in both isolates, which are commonly associated with uptake of complex organic molecules. Polaribacter sp. BAL334 showed stronger metabolic responses to DOM harvested from exponential than stationary phase dinoflagellates (128 compared to 26 differentially expressed genes), whereas Brevundimonas sp. BAL450 responded more to the DOM from stationary than exponential phase dinoflagellates (33 compared to 6 differentially expressed genes). These findings suggest that shifts in bacterial metabolisms during different phases of phytoplankton blooms can be detected in individual bacterial species and can provide insights into their involvement in DOM transformations."
https://openalex.org/W4309232206,"Linking fossil species to the extant diversity is often a difficult task, and the correct interpretation of character evidence is crucial for assessing their taxonomic placement. Here, we make use of geometric morphometrics of fore wings to help classify five fossil Darwin wasps from the Early Eocene Fur Formation in Denmark into subfamilies and often tribes. We compile a reference dataset with 342 fore wings of nine extant subfamilies and nine relevant fossil species. Since geometric morphometrics was mostly ignored in the past in Darwin wasp classification, the dataset is first used to examine differences and similarities in wing venation among subfamilies. In a next step, we used the reference dataset to inform the classification of the fossil species, which resulted in the description of one new genus and five new species, Crusopimpla weltii sp. nov., Ebriosa flava gen. et sp. nov., Entypoma? duergari sp. nov., Lathrolestes? zlatorog sp. nov., and Triclistus bibori sp. nov., in four different subfamilies. Carefully assessing data quality, we show that the fore wing venation of fossil Darwin wasps is surprisingly suitable to assign them to a subfamily or even lower taxonomic level, especially when used in conjunction with characters from other parts of the body to narrow down a candidate set of potential subfamilies and tribes. Our results not only demonstrate a fast and useful approach to inform fossil classification but provide a basis for future investigations into evolutionary changes in fore wings of ichneumonids. The high informativeness of wing venation for classification furthermore could be harvested for phylogenetic analyses, which are otherwise often hampered by homoplasy in this parasitoid wasp family."

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the technical efficiency of neonatal health service and its associated factors among primary hospitals in three zones of Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among fifteen randomly selected primary hospitals from March 17 to April 17, 2021. Input data on non-salary recurrent costs, salary costs, and the number of beds, and output data on neonatal admissions, outpatient visits, and referrals for the 2019/20 fiscal year were collected using a document review. In the first stage of analysis, input-oriented data envelopment analysis with a variable return-to-scale assumption was employed to estimate the efficiency scores using DEAP 2.1. A Tobit regression model was fitted in the second stage to identify the associated factors with technical efficiency. Variables with a p-value &lt;0.05 were declared as statistically associated factors. Results In this study, 80% of the primary hospitals were pure technical efficient whereas 46.67% of the facilities were scale efficient with all of the scale inefficient hospitals operating below their scale. The mean pure technical and scale efficiency score of primary hospitals was 0.948±0.113 and 0.887±0.143, respectively. Total catchment population, incentive packages for the clinical staff, and the educational status of the manager were positively associated with the technical efficiency of hospitals. On the other hand, technical efficiency was negatively associated with the presence of a health facility that provides neonatal health services near the hospital and the distance of the manager’s residence. Conclusion Though most of the primary hospitals in Northwest Ethiopia were technical efficient, more than half of them were working below their scale of operation. Our results also indicated that introducing the performance-based provision of incentive packages for clinical staff and employing master’s and above-educated health professionals as a manager might improve the efficient utilization of resources in primary hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W4309232216,"Functional performance in older adults is a predictor of survival and other health outcomes and its measurement is highly recommended in primary care settings. Functional performance and frailty are closely related concepts, and frailty status is associated with the use of health care services. However, there is insufficient evidence on the utilization of services profile according to the functional performance of older adults. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between functional performance and the use of a wide range of health services in community-dwelling older adults. Generalized additive models for location, scale and shape were used to study these complex data of services utilization, from primary to hospital care. A total of 749 participants from two Spanish regions were followed up for 2 years. Of those, 276 (37%) presented low functional performance and 473 (63%) normal performance according to the Timed Up and Go test. The results showed that even after adjusting for burden of comorbidity and polypharmacy, participants with low functional performance used primary and secondary care health services more intensively, visited emergency rooms more often, and were hospitalized more frequently and for longer periods of time. A negative binomial distribution and a variant thereof were found to be the best models to describe health service utilization data. In conclusion, functionality should be considered as an important health indicator for tailoring the provision of health services for older adults."

Meanwhile, it has also become possible to use multi-source data to explore the factors influencing urban residents' car-hailing trips. Using online data on car-hailing trajectories, points of interest (POIs) data and other auxiliary data, the paper explores how the built environment impacts online car-hailing passengers. Within a 200 x 200m research grid, the unique spatiotemporal patterns of weekday car-hailing trips during a one-week period are analyzed, using statistics on pick-ups and drop-offs at different time of the day. By combining these data with built environment variables and various economic and traffic indicators, a multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model is developed for different time scales. The MGWR model outperforms the classical geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model in terms of goodness of fit and all other aspects. More importantly, this study finds a high degree of temporal and spatial heterogeneity in the impact of built environment factors on local car-hailing trips across different regions, and the paper analyzes the business residence coefficient in detail. The study provides valuable insights to help improve the level of urban transportation services, as well as urban transportation planning and construction."
https://openalex.org/W4309232331,"The generation of massive data puts forward higher requirements for storage technology. DNA storage is a new storage technology which uses biological macromolecule DNA as information carrier. Compared with traditional silicon-based storage, DNA storage has the advantages of large capacity, high density, low energy consumption and high durability. DNA coding is to store data information with as few base sequences as possible without errors. Coding is a key technology in DNA storage, and its results directly affect the performance of storage and the integrity of data reading and writing. In this paper, a Levy Equilibrium Optimizer (LEO) algorithm is proposed to construct a DNA storage code set that satisfies combinatorial constraints. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on 13 benchmark functions, and 4 new global optima are obtained. Under the same constraints, the DNA storage code set is constructed. Compared with previous work, the lower bound of DNA storage code set is improved by 4–13%."
https://openalex.org/W4309232374,"Objective Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a well-known phenomenon among breast cancer survivors. Cognitive impairment among breast cancer survivors can significantly affect their quality of life and ability to function independently. However, there is a lack of specific and focused cognitive intervention to improve their cognitive performances. This study aimed to develop a tailored cognitive intervention framework module by adapting the attention and memory interventions from the Cognitive Rehabilitation Manual of the Brain Injury Interdisciplinary Special Interest Group (BI-SIG) of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) and incorporating them with the relevant exercises for cognitive rehabilitation for Malaysian breast cancer survivors with CRCI based on the consensus agreement of the expert panel. Methods and analysis The Delphi consensus technique was conducted online to review and evaluate the framework module. A panel of experts, including rehabilitation medicine physicians, occupational therapists, and clinical psychologists in Malaysia, was invited to participate in this study. For each round, the expert consensus was defined as more than 90% of the expert panel agreeing or strongly agreeing with the proposed items. Results A total of 33 practitioners completed the three Delphi rounds. 72.7% of the expert panel have been practising in their relevant clinical fields for more than six years (M = 10.67, SD = 5.68). In Round 1, 23% of the experts suggested that the framework module for attention training required further improvements, specifically in the language (M = 1.97, SD = 0.75) and instructions (M = 2.03, SD = 0.71) provided. In Round 2, 15% of the experts recommended additional changes in the instruction (M = 2.15, SD = 0.67) for attention training. Amendments made to the framework module in line with the recommendations provided by the experts resulted in a higher level of consensus, as 94% to 100% of the experts in Round 3 concluded the framework module was suitable and comprehensive for our breast cancer survivors. Following the key results, the objectives were practical, and the proposed approaches, strategies, and techniques for attention and memory training were feasible. The clarity of the instructions, procedures, verbatim transcripts, and timeframe further enhanced the efficacy and utility of the framework module. Conclusions This study found out that the cognitive intervention framework module for breast cancer survivors with cognitive impairment following chemotherapy can be successfully developed and feasible to be implemented using Delphi technique."
https://openalex.org/W4309232488,"Wearable devices are a popular training tool to measure biomechanical performance indicators during running, including vertical oscillation (VO). VO is a contributing factor in running economy and injury risk, therefore VO feedback can have a positive impact on running performance. The validity and reliability of the VO measurements from wearable devices is crucial for them to be an effective training tool. The aims of this study were to test the validity and reliability of VO measurements from wearable devices against video analysis of a single trunk marker. Four wearable devices were compared: the INCUS NOVA, Garmin Heart Rate Monitor-Pro (HRM), Garmin Running Dynamics Pod (RDP), and Stryd Running Power Meter Footpod (Footpod). Fifteen participants completed treadmill running at five different self-selected speeds for one minute at each speed. Each speed interval was completed twice. VO was recorded simultaneously by video and the wearables devices. There was significant effect of measurement method on VO (p < 0.001), with the NOVA and Footpod underestimating VO compared to video analysis, while the HRM and RDP overestimated. Although there were significant differences in the average VO values, all devices were significantly correlated with the video analysis (R > = 0.51, p < 0.001). Significant agreement between repeated VO measurements for all devices, revealed the devices to be reliable (ICC > = 0.948, p < 0.001). There was also significant agreement for VO measurements between each device and the video analysis (ICC > = 0.731, p < = 0.001), therefore validating the devices for VO measurement during running. These results demonstrate that wearable devices are valid and reliable tools to detect changes in VO during running. However, VO measurements varied significantly between the different wearables tested and this should be considered when comparing VO values between devices."
https://openalex.org/W4309232599,"This study investigates the financial cost of increasing the diversity of cereal grains in livestock feed rations. We first develop a nonlinear mathematical programming model that determines the least-cost composition of livestock feed rations of one metric ton that have at least the same energy and nutrient content as a reference feed ration. We then add into the model a diversity constraint using the Simpson Index of diversity to examine how changes in the diversity of the commodities in the ration affect the cost of the ration while maintaining the ration's energy and nutrient content at a reference ration value. We apply the model to cereal grain feed rations for livestock in 153 countries, using reference rations that depict the historical composition of cereal grain feed rations offered to livestock in each country. Results suggest that a one percent change in ration diversity changed the ration cost (i.e., the cost-diversity elasticity) from -0.67% to 1.41% (average = -0.02%) across all countries. Our results suggest that changes in ration diversity can come at a financial cost, but this financial cost appears negligible in many countries. This negligible cost could provide the feed sector more encouragement to diversify its feed supply and potentially become more resilient to price and production shocks."

This presents a key opportunity in surgical site infection surveillance. Remote follow up methods have been used via telephone, with photographs and questionnaires for post-operative reviews with varying results. This review therefore aims to comprehensively synthesise available evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of all forms of SSI telemedicine monitoring. The protocol has been established as per both PRISMA-P (S1 Table) and the Cochrane handbook for reviews of diagnostic test accuracy. Medline, Embase, CENTRAL and CINAHL will be searched using a complete search strategy developed with librarian input, in addition to google scholar and hand searching. All study designs with patients over 18 and undergone a primarily closed surgical procedure will be eligible. Index tests will include all forms of telemedicine and a subgroup analysis performed for each of these. Comparative tests must include face to face review, and all reference standards will be included again for sub-group analyses. Search results will be screened by two investigators independently with a third providing consensus review on disagreements. Methodological quality will be assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, first validated by two investigators as per the Cochrane handbook. Exploratory analysis will formulate summary receiver operating characteristic curves and forest plots with estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the included studies. Sources of heterogeneity will be identifying and investigated through further analysis. Potential benefits of telemedicine integration in surgical practice will reduce cost and travel time to patients in addition to avoiding wasted clinic appointments, important considerations in a peri-pandemic era. To avoid missed or further complications, there must be confidence in the ability to diagnose infection. This review will systematically determine whether telemedicine is accurate for surgical site infection diagnosis, which methods are well established and if further research is indicated."
https://openalex.org/W4309263871,"Humpback whales in the western North Pacific are considered endangered due to their small population size and lack of information. Although previous studies have reported interchanges between regions within a population, the relationship between the geographic regions of a population in Japan is poorly understood. Using 3,532 fluke photo IDs of unique individuals obtained from four areas in Japan: Hokkaido, six IDs (2009-2019); Ogasawara, 1,477 IDs, from two organizations (1) Everlasting nature of Asia (1987-2020) and (2) Ogasawara Whale Watching Association, (1990-2020); Amami, 373 IDs (1992-1994, 2005-2016); Okinawa, 1,676 IDs (1990-2018), interchanges were analyzed. The ID matchings were conducted using an automated system with an 80.9% matching accuracy. Interchange and within-region return indices were also calculated. As a result, number of matches and interchange indices follow locations, Hokkaido-Okinawa (3, 0.31), Amami-Ogasawara (36, 0.06), Amami-Okinawa (222, 0.37), and Okinawa-Ogasawara (225, 0.08), respectively. Interchange indices among Japanese areas were much higher than the indices between Ogasawara/Okinawa and Hawaii (0.01) and Mexico (0.00) reported in previous studies, indicating that the Japanese regions are utilized by the same population. At the same time, the frequency of interchanges among the three breeding areas vary, and the high within-region return indices in respective breeding areas suggest the site fidelity of the whales in each area at some level. These results indicate the existence of several groups within the population which are possibly be divided into at least two groups based on geographical features: one tend to utilize Ogasawara and the Mariana Archipelago; the other utilize Amami, Okinawa, and the Philippines, migrating along the Ryukyu and Philippine Trench. The matching results also suggest that Hokkaido is possibly be utilized as a corridor between northern feeding areas and southern breeding areas at least by individuals migrating to Okinawa area."

Our dataset and strategy would flourish the data collection pool of population-level social networks and further develop the research of network analysis in digital media environment."
https://openalex.org/W4309263936,"Small surface-release dams are prevalent across North American watersheds and can alter stream flow, thermal regimes, nutrient dynamics, and sediment transport. These dams are often implicated as a cause of negative water quality impacts—including reduced dissolved oxygen (DO)—and dam removal is increasingly employed to restore natural stream processes and improve DO. Published impacts of small dams on DO vary widely across sites, and even less is known about the extent and timescale of DO recovery following removal. Therefore, we sought to quantify the effects of small dams and dam removal on DO and determine the dam, stream, and watershed characteristics driving inter-site variation in responses. We deployed continuous data loggers for 3 weeks during summer months in upstream (reference), impoundment, and downstream reaches at each of 15 dammed sites and collected equivalent data at 10 of those sites following dam removal. Prior to dam removal, most sites (60%) experienced a decrease in DO (an average of 1.15 mg/L lower) within the impoundment relative to upstream, but no consistent impacts on diel ranges or on downstream reaches. Before dam removal, 5 impacted stream reaches experienced minimum DO levels below acceptable water quality standards (&lt;5 mg/L); after dam removal, 4 of 5 of these reaches met DO standards. Sites with wider impoundments relative to upstream widths and sites located in watersheds with more cultivated land experienced the greatest decreases in impoundment DO relative to upstream. Within one year following dam removal, impoundment DO recovered to upstream reference conditions at 80% of sites, with the magnitude of recovery strongly related to the magnitude of pre-removal impacts. These data suggest that broadly, small dams negatively affect stream DO, and the extent of effects are modulated by impoundment geometry and watershed characteristics. These results may help practitioners to prioritize restoration efforts at those sites where small dams are having outsized impacts, and therefore where the greatest water quality benefits may occur."
https://openalex.org/W3214883965,"Divide-and-conquer dividing by a half recurrences, of the form [Formula: see text] appear in many areas of applied mathematics, from the analysis of algorithms to the optimization of phylogenetic balance indices. These equations are usually ""solved"" by means of a Master Theorem that provides a bound for the growing order of xn, but not the solution's explicit expression. In this paper we give a finite explicit expression for this solution, in terms of the binary decomposition of n, when the independent term p(n) is a polynomial in ⌈n/2⌉ and ⌊n/2⌋. As an application, we obtain explicit formulas for several sequences of interest in phylogenetics, combinatorics, and computer science, for which no such formulas were known so far: for instance, for the Total Cophenetic index and the rooted Quartet index of the maximally balanced bifurcating phylogenetic trees with n leaves, and the sum of the bitwise AND operator applied to pairs of complementary numbers up to n."
https://openalex.org/W4309231711,"Marine renewables could form a significant part of the green energy mix. However, a potential environmental impact of tidal energy converters (TECs) is collision risk between a device and animal, which has been a significant barrier in the consenting process. While it is important to understand the number of collisions of an animal with the device, the relative speed at which an animal collides with the device, and the point on the animal where collision occurs, will determine whether a collision is fatal, which is important in understanding population-level impacts. Using a simulation-based collision risk model, this paper demonstrates a novel method for producing estimates of mortality. Extracting both the speed and the location of collisions between an animal and TEC, in this instance a seal and horizontal axis turbine, collision speed and location of collision are used to produce probabilities of mortality. To provide a hypothetical example we quantified the speed and position at which a collision occurs to estimate mortality and, using collision position, we determine all predicted collisions with the head of the animal as fatal, for example, whilst deeming other collisions non-fatal. This is the first collision risk model to incorporate speed at the point of contact and the location where the collision occurs on the animal, to estimate the probability of mortality resulting from a collision. The hypothetical scenarios outline how these important variables extracted from the model can be used to predict the proportion of fatal events. This model enables a comprehensive approach that ultimately provides advancements in collision risk modelling for use in the consenting process of TECs. Furthermore, these methods can easily be adapted to other renewable energy devices and receptors, such as wind and birds."
https://openalex.org/W4309231923,"Previous research has demonstrated that emotional faces affect time perception, however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Earlier attempts focus on effects at the different stages of the pacemaker-accumulator model (clock, memory, and/or decision-making) including, an increase in pacemaker rate or accumulation rate via arousal or attention, respectively, or by biasing decision-making. A visual temporal bisection task with sub-second intervals was conducted in two groups to further investigate these effects; one group was strictly behavioral whereas the second included a 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG). To separate the influence of face and timing responses, participants timed a visual stimulus, temporally flanked (before and after) by two faces, either negative or neutral, creating three trial-types: Neg→Neut, Neut→Neg, or Neut→Neut. We found a leftward shift in bisection point (BP) in Neg→Neut relative to Neut→Neut suggests an overestimation of the temporal stimulus when preceded by a negative face. Neurally, we found the face-responsive N170 was larger for negative faces and the N1 and contingent negative variation (CNV) were larger when the temporal stimulus was preceded by a negative face. Additionally, there was an interaction effect between condition and response for the late positive component of timing (LPCt) and a significant difference between response (short/long) in the neutral condition. We concluded that a preceding negative face affects the clock stage leading to more pulses being accumulated, either through attention or arousal, as indexed by a larger N1, CNV, and N170; whereas viewing a negative face after impacted decision-making mechanisms, as evidenced by the LPCt."

Measurements were obtained using a wristwatch-type WD with optical measurement technology that can measure SBP and DBP every 10 minutes and HR every 30 minutes. SBP, DBP, and HR data obtained at baseline and during work time were combined with the hours of work, day of the week, job, and workplace recorded by the participants in 8 consecutive weeks. We calculated the mean, the ratio to baseline and coefficient of variation [CV(%)] for SBP, DBP, and HR. SBP, DBP, and HR values were significantly higher during work hours than at baseline (p&lt;0.03). The ratio to baseline values ranged from 1.02 to 1.26 for SBP and from 1.07 to 1.30 for DBP. The ratio to baseline for SBP and DBP showed CV(%) of approximately 10% according to the day of the week and over the study period. For HR, ratio to baseline ranged from 0.95 to 1.29. The ratio of mean BP to baseline was &gt;1.2 at the time of starting work, middle and after lunch, and at 14:00. The ratio to baseline of SBP were 1.2 or more for irradiation, equipment accuracy control, registration of patient data, dose verification and conference time, and were also working in CT examination room, treatment planning room, linac room, and the office. CV(%) of BP and HR were generally stable for all workplaces. WD measurements of SBP, DBP, and HR were higher during working hours than at baseline and varied by the individuals, work time, job, and workplace. This method may enable evaluation of unconscious workload in individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4309231930,"Environmental regulations, once promulgated, can cause incentive conflict between manufacturers and suppliers. A manufacturer facing the regulation may undertake choices that can affect his sourcing decisions with the supplier. To analyze this, we develop a game-theoretic model considering a manufacturer who faces a per-unit carbon emissions cap and sources from a supplier. The manufacturer operates in a carbon sensitive market. We analyze the responses of the manufacturer and supplier and show that since the burden of carbon emissions cap is borne by the manufacturer, the first-best outcomes are not reached. Therefore, the supplier may offer different contracts to incentivize the manufacturer. We study two mechanisms: the two-part tariff and the revenue-and-investment sharing contracts. We show how such contracts achieve coordination and deliver efficient supply chain outcomes. Interestingly, we find that the contract preferences of the manufacturer and the supplier may not be the same and vary under different market conditions. Summarily, we highlight important considerations for the supply chain players in designing suitable incentives."

Identifying the minimum dose of HA required to elicit a heat adapted phenotype could reduce financial constraints on participants and aid in the tapering phase for competition in hot countries. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate a 4 d HA regimen on physical performance.Twelve moderately trained males were heat acclimated using controlled hyperthermia (Tre&gt;38.5°C), with no fluid intake for 90 min on 4 consecutive days, with a heat stress test (HST) being completed one week prior to (HST2), and within one-week post (HST3) HA. Eleven completed the control study of HST1 versus HST2, one week apart with no intervention. Heat stress tests comprised of cycling for 90 min @ 40% Peak Power Output (PPO); 35°C; 60%RH followed by 10 minutes of passive recovery before an incremental test to exhaustion. Physical performance outcomes time to exhaustion (TTE), PPO, end rectal temperature (Tre END), and heart rate (HREND) was measured during the incremental test to exhaustion.Physiological markers indicated no significant changes in the heat; however descriptive statistics indicated mean resting Tre lowered 0.24°C (-0.54 to 0.07°C; d = 2.35: very large) and end-exercise lowered by 0.32°C (-0.81 to 0.16; d = 2.39: very large). There were significant improvements across multiple timepoints following HA in perceptual measures; Rate of perceived exertion (RPE), Thermal Sensation (TS), and Thermal Comfort (TC) (P&lt;0.05). Mean TTE in the HST increased by 142 s (323±333 to 465±235s; P = 0.04) and mean PPO by 76W (137±128 to 213±77 W; P = 0.03).Short-term isothermic HA (4 d) was effective in enhancing performance capacity in hot and humid conditions. Regardless of the level of physiological adaptations, behavioural adaptations were sufficient to elicit improved performance and thermotolerance in hot conditions. Additional exposures may be requisite to ensure physiological adaptation."

We report survey results aimed at assessing the overall satisfaction of Molecular Medicine (MolMed) PhD program graduates with their training program and subsequent employment, their research productivity since graduation, and the program elements important for entering their diverse career choices. The survey consisted of quantitative and qualitative instruments and was deployed in June 2020 via email to 45 alumni who had graduated at least two years prior. Investigators assessed mean and median Likert scale data and they conducted a qualitative content analysis on all open-ended narrative survey data using inductive analysis to identify themes. Of the 45 contacted, 26 PhD graduates of the MolMed program responded to the survey. Overall, graduates felt the MolMed curriculum prepared them well for their current career (mean 3.4 out a 4-point Likert scale); and, knowing what they know now, they would likely pursue a PhD degree again (mean 3.7 out of 4). Four overarching themes emerged from the content analysis of the narrative survey data: curriculum and other training experiences; professional skills; importance of a strong advisor/mentor; and, networking and career development. Overall, alumni were satisfied with their MolMed Program experience. They found the curriculum to be strong and relevant, and they believed that it prepared them well for their careers. There may be opportunities to embed additional skills into the curriculum, and the program should continue to offer a strong mentoring and clinical experience, as well as train students for diverse career trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W4309232126,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is widely used in all areas of genetic research, such as genetic disease diagnosis and breeding, and it can produce massive amounts of data. The identification of sequence variants is an important step when processing large NGS datasets; however, currently, the process is complicated, repetitive, and requires concentration, which can be taxing on the researcher. Therefore, to support researchers who are not familiar enough with bioinformatics to identify sequence variations regularly from large datasets, we have developed a fully automated desktop software, NGSpop. NGSpop includes functionalities for all the variant calling and visualization procedures used when processing NGS data, such as quality control, mapping, filtering details, and variant calling. In the variant calling step, the user can select the GATK or DeepVariant algorithm for variant calling. These algorithms can be executed using pre-set pipelines and options or customized with the user-specified options. NGSpop is implemented using JavaFX (version 1.8) and can thus be run on Unix-like operating systems such as Ubuntu Linux (version 16.04, 18.0.4). Although several pipelines and visualization tools are available for NGS data analysis, most integrated environments do not support batch processes; thus, variant detection cannot be automated for population-level studies. The NGSpop software developed in this study has an easy-to-use interface and helps in rapid analysis of multiple NGS data from population studies. According to a benchmark test, it effectively reduced the carbon footprint in bioinformatics analysis by expending the least central processing unit heat and power. Additionally, this software makes it possible to use the GATK and DeepVariant algorithms more flexibly and efficiently than other programs by allowing users to choose between the algorithms. As a limitation, NGSpop currently supports only the sequencing reads in fastq format produced by the Illumina platform. NGSpop is freely available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspop/ ."
https://openalex.org/W4309232209,"Graves’ ophthalmopathy (GO) is a complex inflammatory condition affecting the orbit and is often associated with Graves’ disease (GD). This study aims to determine the levels of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor autoantibody (TSHR-ab) in the serum of patients with GO, compare it with the GD, and determine whether there is a correlation with the clinical course of GO. The cross-sectional study included 82 patients with GO, 81 patients with GD, and 75 healthy subjects. The ocular manifestations of GO were identified and evaluated by the clinical activity score (CAS) and severity of GO using the European Group of Graves’ Orbitopathy (EUGOGO). TSI and TSHR-ab levels in the serum of participants were determined with ELISA kits and correlated with clinical findings. A total of 238 participant’s data were analyzed. There were 14 patients (17%) with unilateral GO. The most common ocular signs were eyelid retraction 68 (82.3%) and proptosis 61 (74.4%). The mean CAS score was 2.65±1.64 in GO patients and was higher in men than women ( P = 0.008). The mean of TSI was 37.95±35.41 in GO, 14.16±15.67 in GD, and 4.33±2.94 in healthy controls ( P &lt;0.0001). The TSI was significantly higher in patients with GO than in those with GD ( P &lt;0.0001). There were no correlations between TSI and TSHR-ab levels and CAS scores. However, we observed a correlation between the TSI level and the severity of GO ( P = 0.023). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of TSI was 0.933 and selected 14.1 IU/ml was the optimal cutoff value (98.78% of sensitivity, 83.97% of specificity). Our study showed that TSI is significantly related to GO and the severity of GO. Therefore, TSI can be used as a predictor of severe GO to help in prognostication, follow-up and treatment planning."
https://openalex.org/W4309232213,"Various cell crack modes (with or without electrically inactive cell areas) can be induced in crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells within a PV module through natural thermomechanical stressors such as strong winds, heavy snow, and large hailstones. Although degradation in the performance of PV modules by cell cracks has been reported occasionally, the mode-dependent evolutions in the electrical signatures of cracks have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we propose that the reduction of the time constant in the AC impedance spectra, which is caused by the elevation of minority-carrier recombination in the p-n junction of a PV cell, is a ubiquitous signature of cracked PV cells encapsulated in a commercially available PV module. Several other characteristics derived from the illuminated current-voltage (I-V) and dark I-V data significantly evolved only in PV cells with inactive cell areas. We also propose that the evaluation by carrier recombination is a crucial diagnostic technique for detecting all crack modes, including microcracks, in wafer-based PV modules."

In the Mediterranean Sea, decapod crustacean fisheries are among the most profitable, although in many cases their early life stages are poorly known. In this study, we tackle the composition and diversity patterns of the decapod larval communities along the eastern Spanish Mediterranean coast. Zooplankton sampling was carried out in surface waters at 101 stations from July 20th to August 31st 2016, over bottom depths between 90 and 1840 m. All shrimp larvae were identified to the lowest possible taxonomical level, and larvae from Anomura, Achelata and Brachyura were left at infraorder level. No larvae of Astacidea or Polychelida were found. The total zooplankton volume was estimated. A total of 20,022 decapod crustacean larvae were identified, focusing on shrimp taxa (suborder Dendrobranchiata and infraorder Caridea). Both zooplankton volume and decapod larval density values were higher in the northern part of the studied area, cut by deep submarine canyons. After assessing the diversity parameters of the decapod larval community, we present the summer mesoscale larval distribution of several species of commercial interest such as the caramote prawn (Penaeus kerathurus) or the deep-water rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris). The northern submarine canyons are dominated by the presence of Penaeoidea, being the deep-sea shrimp Aristeus antennatus the dominant species in the community in this area, while the Sergestoidea are more abundant in the southern zone. This is the largest-scale study on decapod larvae mesoscale distribution in the Mediterranean Sea."
https://openalex.org/W4309232326,"Introduction In Uganda, adult men living with HIV are more likely to present late for care; with a CD4 cell count below 350 cells/μl compared to women. Understanding why adult men present late for HIV care is important in improving early linkage to care. Studies across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa emphasize the role of masculinity norms; defined as social expectations about appropriate roles and behavior for men, in men’s health behaviours particularly, in HIV care engagement. This study therefore explored how masculinity norms influence men’s late presentation for HIV care. Methods This was a qualitative study undertaken in Jinja District, Eastern Uganda between October and November 2020. We conducted 20 In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) with men living with HIV who had presented late for care at Family Hope Centre. We also conducted four Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with HIV negative men and women in selected communities of Katende and Walukuba. Conventional content analysis approach was used to identify themes across the collected data. Results A total of 20 men participated in the In-depth Interviews (IDIs), with majority being married 15/20 (75%) and primary level holders 7/15 (46.7%). Nineteen (19) women participated in two FGDs, with a mean age of 29.5 years. Nineteen (19) men also participated in other two FGDs, with a mean age of 28.2 years. Conventional content analysis results indicated that men’s late presentation for HIV care in Jinja district is greatly related to their concerns of loss of respect and the need to preserve their reputation and maintain a sense of normality in their families and society as proposed by Wilson’s (1969) respectability-reputation theoretical model. Respectability was endorsed by ‘the wider society’, while reputation was endorsed almost entirely by men and some women. Conclusion Findings show that the explanations for men’s late presentation arise from the masculinity norms in Jinja District, Eastern Uganda."

Methods A retrospective examination of all mediastinal biopsy procedures between April 2015 and August 2019 was performed at Akershus University Hospital in Norway. We registered patient and procedure characteristics, along with lesion pathology and characteristics including localization according to anatomical and Felson mediastinal compartments. Results The study included 48 procedures, conducted in 45 patients (29 men and 16 women) with a mean age of 60,5 years. Pneumothorax occurred in 12 procedures (60% of the transpulmonary procedures) and pneumomediastinum in 18 procedures (38%). Pneumothorax was only seen in procedures with transpulmonal access. Four of the pneumothorax cases required pleural drainage. Diagnostic yield was 96%. We found significant (p = 0,006), moderate to high association between anatomical compartment localization and histopathological diagnosis (Cramér’s V = 0,49) for tumours selected for CT-guided percutaneous biopsy. Felson’s compartment division on the other hand, did not show any significant associations. Conclusion We found CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of mediastinal tumours to be an effective and safe procedure with a diagnostic yield of 96%. The main complications were pneumothorax and pnumomediastinum, with a relatively low chest drainage rate. Anatomical mediastinum compartment showed a significant, moderate to high association with the histopathological diagnosis for tumours selected for percutaneous CT-guided biopsies, where most malignancies were seen in the anterior compartment."
https://openalex.org/W4309232452,"Screening, prevention, and management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs, including obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes) is the core function of Integrated Measurement for Early Detection (MIDO), a digital strategy developed by the Carlos Slim Foundation in Mexico. An extension of this strategy, MIDO COVID, was developed to address the need for an integrated plan in primary health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. MIDO COVID facilitates planning, surveillance, testing, and clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the major NCDs and their pre-disease states, to streamline the continuum of care. MIDO COVID screening was applied in 1063 Carso Group workplaces in 190 municipalities of the 32 Mexican states. Staff were trained to screen healthy workers for NCDs using a questionnaire, anthropomorphic measurements, and blood work; healthy individuals returning to work also received a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test. Between June 26 and December 31, 2020, 58,277 asymptomatic individuals underwent screening. The prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes was 32.1%, 25.7%, and 9.7% respectively. Only 2.2%, 8.8%, and 4.5% of individuals, respectively, were previously aware of their condition. Pre-obesity was identified in 38.6%, pre-hypertension in 17.4%, and prediabetes in 7.5% of the population. Risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was highest for individuals with multiple NCDs. Many Mexicans are unaware of their health status and potentially increased risk of COVID-19 and serious complications. As a universal strategy implemented regardless of social factors, MIDO COVID promotes equity in access to health care prevention and early stage detection of NCDs; the information gained may help inform decisionmakers regarding prioritising vulnerable populations for immunisation."
https://openalex.org/W4309232557,"Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor for the inflammatory lipid mediators cysteinyl leukotrienes, which are involved in smooth muscle constriction, vascular permeability, and macrophage chemokine release. The Cysltr1 gene encoding CysLTR1 is expressed in the macrophage lineage, including osteoclasts, and the CysLTR1 antagonist Montelukast has been shown to suppress the formation of osteoclasts. However, it currently remains unclear whether CysLTR1 is involved in osteoclast differentiation and bone loss. Therefore, to clarify the role of CysLTR1 in osteoclastogenesis and pathological bone loss, we herein generated CysLTR1 loss-of-function mutant mice by disrupting the cysltr1 gene using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. These mutant mice had a frameshift mutation resulting in a premature stop codon ( Cysltr1 KO) or an in-frame mutation causing the deletion of the first extracellular loop ( Cysltr1 Δ105 ). Bone marrow macrophages (BMM) from these mutant mice lost the intracellular flux of calcium in response to leukotriene D 4 , indicating that these mutants completely lost the activity of CysLTR1 without triggering genetic compensation. However, disruption of the Cysltr1 gene did not suppress the formation of osteoclasts from BMM in vitro . We also demonstrated that the CysLTR1 antagonist Montelukast suppressed the formation of osteoclasts without functional CysLTR1. On the other hand, disruption of the Cysltr1 gene partially suppressed the formation of osteoclasts stimulated by leukotriene D 4 and did not inhibit that by glutathione, functioning as a substrate in the synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes. Disruption of the Cysltr1 gene did not affect ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis or lipopolysaccharide-induced bone resorption. Collectively, these results suggest that the CysLT-CysLTR1 axis is dispensable for osteoclast differentiation in vitro and pathological bone loss, while the leukotriene D 4 -CysTR1 axis is sufficient to stimulate osteoclast formation. We concluded that the effects of glutathione and Montelukast on osteoclast formation were independent of CysLTR1."
https://openalex.org/W4309232904,"In this work, we implemented an automated method using a correlation coefficient to select a time interval with a minimum movement or rest interval, together with analysis of variance for measurement of blood vessel diameter in the cremaster muscle. Video images binarization using analysis of variance resulted in an enhanced and a clearly defined vessel wall. Histamine (1 mM) induced a marked reduction in vascular diameter (vasoconstriction) in the cremaster muscle from mice fed with standard (SD) and high fat diet (HFD). However, the effect of histamine was reduced in HFD mice compared to SD mice. Thus, the change in vascular diameter was 87.14% ± 7.44% and 52.63% ± 16.27% in SD and HFD mice, respectively. In conclusion, determination of a rest interval with minimal movement and the use of analysis of variance resulted useful to evaluate vascular diameter in small arteries. We suggest this method to streamline experiments facilitating cardiovascular research."

If food residues on tooth surfaces cannot be removed by natural self-cleaning mechanisms that this is likely to lead to an increase dental plaque formation and the risk of dental, periodontal and general diseases. It was the aim of this study to assess oral health, oral hygiene with the influence of handedness and oral health related quality of life in patients with chronic peripheral FP. This study included 86 people. Patients with FP (n = 43) in an FP-group (FPG) were matched with 43 participants without ever diagnosed FP in a control group (CG). Oral health and oral hygiene were assessed in a clinical examination performed in hospital. Decayed-missing-filled-teeth-index, periodontal-screening-index, approximal plaque index and sulcus bleeding index were used to evaluate dental caries and periodontal health status. Oral health-related quality of life data (OHQoL) was collected with the Oral health impact profile (Germany-14) by interview. Oral health parameters in the FPG were significantly worse than in the CG. The median revealed 14.3% more proximal plaque (p = 0.014), 20.8% more sulcus bleeding (p = 0.002) and more than twice as much caries (p = 0.024). The paretic side compared to the non-paretic side of patients was significantly more affected by inflammatory periodontal diseases (p = 0.032) and had a higher prevalence of caries (p = 0.163). Right-handed patients with right-sided FP performed worse than right-handed patients with left-sided FP (p = 0.004). Patients with FP described a greater limitation of OHQoL than patients without this disease (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, facial nerve palsy affects oral health, oral hygiene and OHQoL of patients while handedness influences oral hygiene and oral health."
https://openalex.org/W4309263867,"Magnetic nanoparticles (MNps) have become powerful tools for multiple biomedical applications such as hyperthermia drivers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) vectors, as well as drug-delivery systems. However, their toxic effects on human health have not yet been fully elucidated, especially in view of their great diversity of surface modifications and functionalizations. Citrate-coating of MNps often results in increased hydrophilicity, which may positively impact their performance as drug-delivery systems. Nonetheless, the consequences on the intrinsic toxicity of such MNps are unpredictable. Herein, novel magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles covered with citrate were synthesized and their potential intrinsic acute toxic effects were investigated using in vitro and in vivo models. The proposed synthetic pathway turned out to be simple, quick, inexpensive, and reproducible. Concerning toxicity risk assessment, these citrate-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (IONps) did not affect the in vitro viability of different cell lines (HaCaT and HepG2). Moreover, the in vivo acute dose assay (OECD test guideline #425) showed no alterations in clinical parameters, relevant biochemical variables, or morphological aspects of vital organs (such as brain, liver, lung and kidney). Iron concentrations were slightly increased in the liver, as shown by Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry and Perls Prussian Blue Staining assays, but this finding was considered non-adverse, given the absence of accompanying functional/clinical repercussions. In conclusion, this study reports on the development of a simple, fast and reproducible method to obtain citrate-coated IONps with promising safety features, which may be used as a drug nanodelivery system in the short run.

https://openalex.org/W4309263894,"Background Pregestational diabetes, obesity and gestational weight gain (GWG) are associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, however, the influence of excessive GWG on lactation at discharge is less known. Our aim is to evaluate the impact of excessive GWG using the LifeCycle project guidelines on exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and any BF rates at discharge among 171 women with Type 1 and 294 Type 2 diabetes and obesity who intended to BF. Methods and findings Retrospective cohort study. Obesity was defined by BMI (kg/m 2 ) as grade 1 (30–34.9), grade 2 (35–39.9) or grade 3 (≥40). GWG was categorized as adequate , inadequate or excessive according to the 2019 LifeCycle Project guidelines. Women with Type 1 were younger (30 vs 33y), primiparous (51 vs 32%), delivered earlier (37 vs 38w) than women with Type 2 andwere different in grade 1 (40 vs 26%), grade 3 obesity (19 vs 49%) and median GWG (15 vs 11kg). Of all 465 women with Type 1 and Type 2 combined, 365 (78%) who had excessive GWG and 100 (22%) who had non- excessive GWG showed similar EBF (27 vs 25%) and any BF (72 vs 72%) rates. Regression analysis showed that after adjusting for potential confounders excessive GWG was not a predictor of EBF or any BF at discharge. Conclusion Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, obesity and excessive GWG are associated with low EBF, however, excessive GWG is not an independent predictor of low EBF or any BF at discharge."
https://openalex.org/W4309263907,"Mayaro virus (MAYV, Togaviridae) and Oropouche orthobunyavirus (OROV, Peribunyaviridae) are emerging enzootic arboviruses in Latin America. Outbreaks of febrile illness associated with MAYV and OROV have been reported among humans mainly in the northern region of Brazil since the 1980s, and recent data suggest these viruses have circulated also in more populated areas of western Brazil. MAYV shares mosquito vectors with yellow fever virus and it has been historically detected during yellow fever epidemics. Aiming to investigate the transmission of OROV and MAYV at the human-animal interface during a yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika outbreaks in Brazil, we conducted a retrospective molecular investigation in 810 wild and domestic animals, 106 febrile patients, and 22.931 vectors collected from 2016 to 2018 in Cuiaba and Campo Grande metropolitan regions, western Brazil. All samples tested negative for OROV and MAYV RNA by RT-qPCR. Findings presented here suggest no active circulation of MAYV and OROV in the sampled hosts. Active surveillance and retrospective investigations are instrumental approaches for the detection of cryptic and subclinical activity of enzootic arboviruses and together serve as a warning system to implement appropriate actions to prevent outbreaks."
