Astrocytic glycogen breakdown and lactate release are essential for long-term but not short-term memory formation, and for the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength elicited in vivo. Disrupting the expression of the astrocytic lactate transporters monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) or MCT1 causes amnesia, which, like LTP impairment, is rescued by L-lactate but not equicaloric glucose. Disrupting the expression of the neuronal lactate transporter MCT2 also leads to amnesia that is unaffected by either L-lactate or glucose, suggesting that lactate import into neurons is necessary for long-term memory. Glycogenolysis and astrocytic lactate transporters are also critical for the induction of molecular changes required for memory formation, including the induction of phospho-CREB, Arc, and phospho-cofilin. We conclude that astrocyte-neuron lactate transport is required for long-term memory formation.

Learning results in glycogenolysis-dependent lactate increase in the hippocampus Inhibiting glycogenolysis in the hippocampus blocks long-term memory and LTP Knockdown of astrocytic lactate transporters abolishes long-term memory Knockdown of neuronal lactate transporter abolishes long-term memory Astrocytes have been generally believed to have a mainly supportive function for neurons in the central nervous system (Kettenmann and Ransom, 2005Kettenmann H. Ransom B.R. Neuroglia.Second Edition. Oxford University Press, New York2005Google Scholar). However, a growing body of evidence suggests that they play many more active roles, including information processing, signal transmission and regulation of neural and synaptic plasticity (Halassa and Haydon, 2010Halassa M.M.

Thus, brain functions, including perhaps cognitive ones, may result from the concerted action of a neuron–glia network. Little is known about the physiological contribution and relative mechanisms of astrocytes to cognitive functions. Astrocytic adenosine modulates sleep homeostasis and cognitive consequences of sleep loss (Halassa et al., 2009Halassa M.M. Florian C. Fellin T. Munoz J.R. Lee S.Y. Abel T. Haydon P.G. Frank M.G.

Spatial learning and working memory in rats appears to increase the number of astrocytes (Jahanshahi et al., 2008aJahanshahi M. Sadeghi Y. Hosseini A. Naghdi N. Marjani A.

Inhibition of glycogenolysis in astrocytes interrupts memory consolidation in young chickens.Glia. 2006; 54: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), which is known to occur in astrocytes and not in neurons (Magistretti, 2008Magistretti P.J. Brain energy metabolism.in: Squire L.R. Berg D. Bloom F.E. du Lac S. Ghosh A. Spitzer N.C. Fundamental Neuroscience. 3rd. Academic Press, San Diego2008: 271-293Google Scholar), suggesting that byproducts of glycogen metabolism are critical for memory formation. One mechanism through which astrocytes and neurons may actively be linked is through metabolic coupling, particularly as a result of neuronal activity (e.g., Magistretti, 2008Magistretti P.J.

An important source of energy for the brain is glucose entering via transport across the blood brain barrier into both neurons and astrocytes. Astrocytes, but not neurons, store glycogen (Brown et al., 2004Brown A.M. Baltan Tekkok S. Ransom B.R. Energy transfer from astrocytes to axons: the role of CNS glycogen.Neurochem.

Brain contains a functional glucose-6-phosphatase complex capable of endogenous glucose production.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11114-11119Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both glucose and lactate can then be exported to neurons as fuel (Brown et al., 2004Brown A.M. Baltan Tekkok S. Ransom B.R.

Alternatively, astrocytes may utilize glycogen and spare the glucose for neurons' use (DiNuzzo et al., 2010DiNuzzo M. Mangia S. Maraviglia B. Giove F.

The transport of lactate occurs via monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), proton-linked membrane carriers that transport monocarboxylates including lactate, pyruvate and ketone bodies across the cell membrane. MCT4 is expressed mainly by astrocytes, whereas MCT2 is primarily neuronal and MCT1 is expressed in astrocytes, endothelial cells of microvessels ependymocytes and oligodendrocytes (Pierre and Pellerin, 2005Pierre K.

The hypothesis of an astrocyte-neuron metabolic coupling is attractive because it would underscore the importance of functionally connecting these two cell types during activity subserving brain functions, including perhaps cognitive ones. New learning initiates a cascade of events in the brain that can lead to short and long-term memories. While short-term memories require posttranslational modifications, the consolidation, or stabilization of long-term memories depends upon the activation of a gene cascade and downstream modifications in neurons that store the acquired information (Dudai, 2004Dudai Y.

Altered protein synthesis is a trigger for long-term memory formation.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2008; 89: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Among the best characterized and widely proven gene expression mechanisms known to underlie memory consolidation are the activation of CREB (cAMP response element binding protein)-dependent gene expression (Alberini, 2009Alberini C.M.

The molecular biology of memory storage: a dialogue between genes and synapses.Science. 2001; 294: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) and the translation, at activated synapses, of the immediate early gene Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeletal protein), which is believed to play a key role in actin cytoskeletal dynamics and regulate the membrane expression of AMPA receptors (Bramham et al., 2008Bramham C.R.

Long-term synaptic plasticity and memory are accompanied by synaptic structural changes, which involve actin polymerization (Chen et al., 2007Chen L.Y. Rex C.S. Casale M.S. Gall C.M. Lynch G.

Phosphorylated cofilin is one of the major regulators of F-actin dynamics in spines, promotes cytoskeleton assembly and regulates spine morphology (Bamburg et al., 1999Bamburg J.R. McGough A. Ono S.

Thus, long-term memory formation appears to have high metabolic demands within the underlying active neuronal network. Here, we employed rat inhibitory avoidance (IA) to test the hypothesis that astrocyte-neuron metabolic coupling mechanisms play a critical role in memory formation. To test whether astrocytic glycogenolysis in the hippocampus affects short- and/or long-term memory retention, we bilaterally injected 300 μM (300 pmol) of the inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylation 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (DAB) (Walls et al., 2008Walls A.B. Sickmann H.M. Brown A. Bouman S.D. Ransom B. Schousboe A. Waagepetersen H.S. Characterization of 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-arabinitol (DAB) as an inhibitor of brain glycogen shunt activity.J. Neurochem. 2008; 105: 1462-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), either 15 min before or immediately after IA training (Figures 1A–1C ). Chicago sky blue injections showed the diffusion, which spread into the dorsal hippocampus approximately 1.7 mm across the injection site (Figure S1). To test for a dose-response effect, 1000 μM (1000 pmol) of DAB, injected immediately after training, was also investigated (Figure 1C).Figure S1Chicago Sky Blue Diffusion after Hippocampal Injection, Related to Figure 1Show full captionRepresentative sections of one rat brain at −2.12, −3.60, and −4.52 mm from bregma, analyzed under light microscopy.

Rats (n = 4) were injected with 1 μl of Chicago sky blue (1%) and euthanized 1 hr after injection. Student's t test showed that DAB injected before training did not affect IA acquisition, as the mean latencies to enter the shock compartment during training (acquisition) were similar in all groups (p > 0.05). DAB did not affect short-term memory 1 hr after training (p > 0.05, Student's t test; Figure 1A). However, DAB injected either before (Figure 1B) or immediately after training (Figure 1C) significantly blocked long-term memory tested at 24 hr (Test 1) in a dose-dependent manner. Retesting 6 days after Test 1 showed that the memory loss persisted (Test 2, p < 0.05, two-way repeated-measure analysis of variance [ANOVA] followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc test; Figure 1B and 1C). The disrupted memory did not reinstate after a foot-shock reminder given one day after Test 2 and tested 24 hr later (Test 3, 15 min before, p < 0.05, Student's t test; immediately after, p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc test). Retraining of the DAB-injected group, 24 hr after Test 3, resulted in normal memory retention 24 hr later (Test 4), indicating that the hippocampus was functionally intact (Figure 1B and 1C). To begin determining the time course of the DAB effect following training, rats were injected with 300 pmol of DAB 24 hr after training and tested 24 hr (Test 1) and 5 days (Test 2) later (Figure 1D). At both Tests, DAB and vehicle-injected rats had comparable memory retention (p > 0.05, two-way repeated-measure ANOVA), indicating that DAB disrupts long-term memory formation during a limited time window: it has a maximal effect when injected shortly before training but no effect when injected 24 hr after training. Similarly, bilateral hippocampal injections of another glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor, isofagomine (Waagepetersen et al., 2000Waagepetersen H.S. Westergaard N. Schousboe A. The effects of isofagomine, a potent glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor, on glycogen metabolism in cultured mouse cortical astrocytes.Neurochem. Int. 2000; 36: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), 15 min before training, significantly disrupted memory retention 24 hr later compared to vehicle (p < 0.05, Student's t test; Figure 1E). Thus, astrocytic hippocampal glycogen mobilization is required for long-term, but not short-term, memory formation. In vitro studies have suggested that glycogenolysis results in lactate release (Brown et al., 2004Brown A.M. Baltan Tekkok S. Ransom B.R. Energy transfer from astrocytes to axons: the role of CNS glycogen.Neurochem. Int. 2004; 45: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, Dringen et al., 1993Dringen R. Gebhardt R. Hamprecht B. Glycogen in astrocytes: possible function as lactate supply for neighboring cells.Brain Res. 1993; 623: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). To test whether glycogenolysis leads to lactate release in vivo after learning, we determined the levels of lactate in the hippocampus of rats before and after training using in vivo microdialysis (Rex et al., 2009Rex A. Bert B. Fink H. Voigt J.P. Stimulus-dependent changes of extracellular glucose in the rat hippocampus determined by in vivo microdialysis.Physiol. Behav. 2009; 98: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Basal lactate dialysate levels remained constant over time before training (Vehicle, 197.95 ± 55.95 μM; DAB, 216.14 ± 43.62 μM). Training led to a statistically significant increase in lactate dialysate levels compared to baseline concentrations (170%–190%, p < 0.05, two-way repeated-measure ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test; Figure 2A ), which was completely abolished by DAB in the perfusion medium, indicating that it resulted from glycogenolysis (p < 0.05, two-way repeated-measure ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test; Figure 2A). Retention latencies of both DAB- and vehicle-injected groups are shown in Figure S2.Figure S2DAB Perfused via Microdialysis Probe Blocked Long-Term Memory, Related to Figure 2AShow full captionHippocampal injections of DAB perfused by microdialysis probe before IA training significantly blocked long-term memory tested at 24 hr after training (n = 3-4/group).

Memory retention is expressed as mean latency ± SEM (in seconds, sec). Mean latency, n and detailed statistic are reported in Table S7. We then asked whether the DAB-induced amnesia could be rescued by the administration of exogenous lactate. Fifteen min before training, rats were bilaterally injected into the hippocampus with a combination of DAB or vehicle and either 10 nmol (Figure 2B), 100 nmol L-lactate (Figure 2C) or vehicle. Memory was tested 24 hr (Test 1) and 7 days (Test 2) after training. Acquisition was not affected by treatment (p > 0.05; one-way ANOVA). DAB injection with vehicle disrupted long-term memory retention, confirming our previous results (Figure 1B). Conversely, 100, but not 10 nmol of L-lactate coadministered with DAB significantly rescued the memory loss. Retesting the rats 7 days after training revealed that the effects of treatments persisted (p < 0.05 for both tests, two-way repeated-measure ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post test). To additionally prove that the transport of L-lactate into neurons is critical for the formation of long-term memory, the competitive effect of the inactive isomer D-lactate was tested. Bilateral hippocampal injection of 20 nmol of D-lactate, 15 min before IA training, significantly blocked memory retention 24 hr after training compared to vehicle (p < 0.05; Student's t test; Figure 2D). Hence, training results in a rapid glycogenolysis and consequent efflux of lactate in the hippocampus, which is critical for long-term memory formation. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a leading cellular model for memory formation and is induced at CA1 synapses by IA (Whitlock et al., 2006Whitlock J.R. Heynen A.J. Shuler M.G. Bear M.F. Learning induces long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.Science. 2006; 313: 1093-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we next tested the effect of blocking glycogen metabolism on LTP in area CA1 of anesthetized young adult rats. After establishing a baseline of responses at Schaffer collateral-area CA1 (SC-CA1) synapses, LTP of SC-CA1 synapses was induced by a high-frequency tetanic stimulation protocol in the absence or presence of DAB delivered locally to the CA1 neuropil through the recording pipette. In the absence of DAB (the control group), robust LTP was induced (fEPSP slope: 133.85 ± 7.9% of baseline at 120 min posttetanus; Figure 3A , closed circles) as expected (Bozdagi et al., 2007Bozdagi O. Nagy V. Kwei K.T. Huntley G.W. In vivo roles for matrix metalloproteinase-9 in mature hippocampal synaptic physiology and plasticity.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the presence of DAB, tetanic stimulation produced a strong initial potentiation, but thereafter, potentiation decayed rapidly to baseline by 75 min in the DAB injected group (Figure 3A, open circles), indicating that DAB blocks the maintenance but not the induction of LTP. To rule out that the effect of DAB on LTP maintenance resulted from non-specific general metabolic demands of the high-frequency tetanic stimulation per se, we tested the effect of DAB on baseline neurotransmission in a group of rats in which LTP was blocked by an i.p. injection of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist MK-801 prior to stimulation. Figure 3A shows that when LTP was blocked by MK-801, DAB had no effect on baseline over 120 min following stimulation, supporting the ides that DAB blocked LTP maintenance selectively. We verified that DAB alone, in the absence of tetanic stimulation, had no effects on basal synaptic transmission by examining parameters that reflect normal synaptic function, including the relationship between stimulus strength and the size of the postsynaptic response (input-output relationship; Figure 3B) or paired-pulse facilitation (PPF, Figure 3C). To determine whether DAB has an effect on LTP once it is established, we injected DAB into CA1 30 min following LTP induction. There was no effect of DAB on synaptic potentiation once established, indicating that glycogen phosphorylase function is required during the induction or early phases of LTP (Figure 3D) (average percentage of baseline 60 min after LTP induction: control, 131.39 ± 11.01%, DAB, 139.86 ± 6.8%, p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). To test if the effect of DAB was due to the astrocytic lactate production, we injected lactate together with DAB prior to LTP induction. Under these conditions, lactate abrogated the blocking effect of DAB on LTP. In the animals injected with lactate and DAB, the increase in fEPSP slope after LTP induction was not significantly different compared to that of control animals (control: 131.39 ± 11.01%, lactate+DAB: 127 ± 13%, of baseline at 60 min posttetanus, p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA; Figure 3E). We then investigated whether the effect we found with DAB was indeed due to the astrocytic release of lactate. Toward this end, we tested the effects of knocking down the hippocampal expression of the lactate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs). In the brain, the MCT1 is expressed mainly in endothelial cells of microvessels, ependymocytes astrocytes and oligodendrocytes but not in neurons, whereas the MCT4 is expressed virtually exclusively in astrocytes (Pierre and Pellerin, 2005Pierre K. Pellerin L. Monocarboxylate transporters in the central nervous system: distribution, regulation and function.J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses of synaptoneurosomal preparations (Villasana et al., 2006Villasana L.E. Klann E. Tejada-Simon M.V. Rapid isolation of synaptoneurosomes and postsynaptic densities from adult mouse hippocampus.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2006; 158: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) showed that MCT4 and MCT2 are highly enriched in the synaptic fraction compared to the total lysate; MCT1, although not enriched compared to total lysate, is clearly present (Figure 4A ). Hence, all these MCTs may be involved in lactate transport across the astrocytic-synaptic compartments. Rats were bilaterally injected into the hippocampus with MCT1-ODN or a relative scrambled control ODN containing the same base pair sequence but in a randomized order (scrambled-ODN, SC1-ODN) 1 hr before training and were euthanized 12 hr after training. Control rats received the same injections but did not undergo training. An ODN injection into the dorsal hippocampus targets and remains confined to this region (e.g., Taubenfeld et al., 2001aTaubenfeld S.M. Milekic M.H. Monti B. Alberini C.M. The consolidation of new but not reactivated memory requires hippocampal C/EBPβ.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), as also shown by the Chicago blue diffusion shown in Figure S1. Dorsal hippocampal extracts obtained from these animals were analyzed for MCT1 expression levels using quantitative western blot analyses. A one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc test showed that the expression of MCT1 was significantly higher in trained compared to untrained rats injected with SC1-ODN (p < 0.05). This induction was completely and selectively blocked by MCT1-ODN (p < 0.05; Figure 4B). In fact, no change in MCT4 and MCT2 concentrations was found across the same samples (MCT2, p > 0.05; MCT4, p > 0.05; one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc test; Figure 4B). Thus, MCT1, but not MCT4 or MCT2 expression is significantly upregulated upon training and MCT1-ODN selectively blocks this enhancement. The efficacy of the MCT1-ODN knock-down was further confirmed with quantitative western blot analyses of hippocampal extracts of trained rats obtained from the area targeted by the injection, that is 1.7 mm around the needle placement. As shown in Figure 4C, MCT1 level was significantly reduced by the MCT1-ODN compared to SC1-ODN (p < 0.05; Student's t test), whereas no change in MCT2 and MCT4 were found (MCT2, p > 0.05; MCT4, p > 0.05; Student's t test). The effect of MCT1-ODN-mediated knock down was then assessed on memory retention (Figures 4D and 4E). Hippocampal injection of MCT1-"

The molecular determinants of this process remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the function of Yap1, the transcriptional effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, in skin biology. Using gain- and loss-of-function studies, we show that Yap1 is a critical modulator of epidermal stem cell proliferation and tissue expansion. Yap1 mediates this effect through interaction with TEAD transcription factors. Additionally, our studies reveal that α-catenin, a molecule previously implicated in tumor suppression and cell density sensing in the skin, is an upstream negative regulator of Yap1. α-catenin controls Yap1 activity and phosphorylation by modulating its interaction with 14-3-3 and the PP2A phosphatase. Together, these data identify Yap1 as a determinant of the proliferative capacity of epidermal stem cells and as an important effector of a “crowd control” molecular circuitry in mammalian skin.

Experimental manipulation of SC numbers or activity during embryogenesis can thus have striking effects on the final size of certain organs (Depaepe et al., 2005Depaepe V. Suarez-Gonzalez N.

Such exquisite regulatory mechanisms also orchestrate homeostasis of adult tissues and regenerative processes whereby the final shape and size of organs can be restored after cellular loss. Though a number of signaling molecules have been implicated in controlling SC proliferation, little is known about endogenous mechanisms that “sense” or provide information about organ size. It is also unclear how these mechanisms relay needs for tissue growth to its resident SCs and how these cues are translated into SC proliferation or apoptosis. The Hippo signaling pathway was initially discovered in Drosophila as a potent mechanism that restricts tissue size by limiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. At the core of this pathway is a kinase cascade composed of four tumor suppressors, including Hippo (Hpo) and Warts (Wts) and its regulatory proteins Salvador and Mats (Harvey et al., 2003Harvey K.F.

Compared with the core kinase cascade regulating Yki phosphorylation, components acting upstream of this complex are less well defined. Earlier work in Drosophila has implicated the apical membrane-associated FERM-domain proteins Merlin (Mer), Expanded (Ex), and Kibra as pathway components upstream of Hpo (Baumgartner et al., 2010Baumgartner R.

Growth regulation: a beginning for the hippo pathway.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: R1037-R1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as modulators of the fly Hippo pathway. However, with the exception of the mammalian Merlin ortholog NF2 (Zhang et al., 2010Zhang N. Bai H. David K.K. Dong J. Zheng Y. Cai J. Giovannini M. Liu P. Anders R.A. Pan D. The Merlin/NF2 tumor suppressor functions through the YAP oncoprotein to regulate tissue homeostasis in mammals.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 27-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), the significance and relevance of these proteins in regulating the activity of Yap1 in vivo in mammals are largely unclear. The identification of physiological upstream regulators of mammalian Hippo signaling could provide important insights into the mechanisms sensing and controlling organ size. The mammalian epidermis is a rapidly regenerating epithelial tissue whose maintenance depends on the self-renewing ability of epidermal SCs residing in the basal layer. After division, short-lived progenitor cells leave the basal layer and move through the suprabasal layers to the tissue surface as they terminally differentiate (Fuchs, 2007Fuchs E. Scratching the surface of skin development.Nature. 2007; 445: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Epidermal growth must be carefully balanced: inadequate proliferation results in thinning of the skin and loss of protection, and excessive growth is characteristic of hyperproliferative disorders. During development, the epidermis must be able to sense needs for expansion and replace basal vacancies, and during regeneration, cells must migrate and proliferate but also sense when to stop after wound closure. It has been postulated that adherens junctions (AJs), cadherin and catenin-based cell adhesion structures, might have a function in sensing epidermal cell density and restricting basal cell proliferation (Lien et al., 2006bLien W.H. Klezovitch O. Vasioukhin V. Cadherin-catenin proteins in vertebrate development.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For instance, loss of some, but not all, AJ components, such as α-catenin or p120-catenin, triggers severe epidermal hyperproliferation and tumors in transgenic mice (Kobielak and Fuchs, 2006Kobielak A. Fuchs E. Links between alpha-catenin, NF-kappaB, and squamous cell carcinoma in skin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 2322-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, Perez-Moreno et al., 2006Perez-Moreno M. Davis M.A. Wong E. Pasolli H.A. Reynolds A.B.

Bauer C. Degenstein L. Wise B. Fuchs E. Hyperproliferation and defects in epithelial polarity upon conditional ablation of alpha-catenin in skin.Cell. 2001; 104: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The mechanisms acting downstream of these complexes are not fully understood. Intriguingly, it has been recently found that NF2 can modulate epidermal development via an association with AJs, specifically α-catenin, and the Par3 polarity complex (Gladden et al., 2010Gladden A.B. Hebert A.M. Schneeberger E.E. McClatchey A.I. The NF2 tumor suppressor, Merlin, regulates epidermal development through the establishment of a junctional polarity complex.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that signaling cues that regulate cell density and cell polarity could converge on the regulation of downstream Hippo signaling components. Here, we utilize gain- and loss-of-function models in mice to show that Yap1 is an essential regulator of epidermal maintenance and SC proliferative capacity. In addition, we identify α-catenin, an AJ component and a known tumor suppressor in the skin, as a crucial upstream negative regulator of Yap1 in epidermal cells in vitro and in vivo. Our work identifies a direct link between a signaling component of cell density-dependent AJs and a transcriptional regulator and provides a paradigm for the regulation of tissue expansion in response to extracellular cues. In newborn mouse epidermis, Yap1 has a dynamic subcellular localization pattern in the basal compartment where it is present in the nucleus in some cells and in the cytoplasm/membrane of others. Expression of Yap1 is reduced and in a more diffuse nonnuclear pattern in the suprabasal-differentiated cell layers (Figure 1A ). This pattern is also observed in cultured human keratinocytes in which high cellular densities lead to Yap1 relocalization out of the nucleus (Figure 1B). Thus, regulation of Yap1 subcellular localization might be important for the switch between proliferative and terminally differentiating compartments. To test this, we utilized transgenic mice carrying a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible allele of a mutated version of Yap1 (S127A). This mutation results in the enhanced nuclear localization of Yap1 (Camargo et al., 2007Camargo F.D. Gokhale S. Johnnidis J.B. Fu D. Bell G.W. Jaenisch R. Brummelkamp T.R.

To restrict Yap1 activation to the epidermis, we developed a binary genetic strategy based on the Cre-mediated activation of a reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator selectively in the progeny of K14-expressing progenitors of stratified epithelia (Belteki et al., 2005Belteki G. Haigh J. Kabacs N. Haigh K. Sison K. Costantini F. Whitsett J. Quaggin S.E. Nagy A.

Lewis P. Bei M. Maas R. McMahon A.P. Sonic hedgehog regulates growth and morphogenesis of the tooth.Development. 2000; 127: 4775-4785PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure S1A available online). Mice carrying these transgenes will be referred to as Tg hereafter. Eight days after Dox administration, adult Tg mice developed thickening and wrinkling of the skin. Histological analyses demonstrated that, contrary to the typical one-/two-cell layer common to adult mouse epidermis, Tg skin developed into a multilayered epithelium (Figure 1C). Staining for the proliferation marker Ki-67 revealed a substantial increase in the number of proliferating basal cells and an extension of the proliferative domain into the suprabasal layers, normally quiescent in control skin (Figure 1D). Tg epidermis contained an abundance of cells expressing progenitor markers such as K5 and K14, whereas expression of the differentiation markers K10 and loricrin was mostly abrogated (Figure 1E and Figure S1B). Additionally, the number of cells expressing p63, a SC marker and essential regulator of stemness in stratified epithelia (Senoo et al., 2007Senoo M. Pinto F. Crum C.P. McKeon F. p63 Is essential for the proliferative potential of stem cells in stratified epithelia.Cell. 2007; 129: 523-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), was amplified in Tg skin (Figure 1F). Tg skin failed to express hair follicle SC markers such as K15, or Sox9 (data not shown). These results suggested that activation of Yap1 induced expansion of an undifferentiated stem/progenitor cell population in the interfollicular epidermis. We then compared the clonogenic capacity of primary keratinocytes isolated 7 days after Dox administration. Skin of Tg mice had a >5-fold increase in the number of colony-forming cells compared to controls after Yap1 activation in vivo (Figure 1E). Moreover, serial plating assays, typically used to distinguish self-renewing SCs versus shorter-lived progenitors, revealed that Yap1 activation enhanced the SC proliferative capacity by 10-fold in secondary and tertiary platings (Figure 1G and Figure S1C). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that activation of Yap1 promotes the proliferation of epidermal stem and progenitor cells and that its regulation is critical in maintaining normal skin homeostasis.Figure S1Hyperproliferation and Carcinoma in Skin of Tg Mice, Related to Figure 1 and Figure 2Show full caption(A) Genetic strategy for temporal spatial regulation of Yap1-S127A in epidermal cells.

Tg mice became ill 8 days after Dox induction, likely because of similar dysplastic changes in mucosal tissues such as the tongue (Figure S1D). In order to assess the long-term effects of Yap1 activation, newborn Tg and control skin was grafted onto Nude-mouse recipients followed by Dox administration. Epidermal thickening, hyperkeratosis, and stunted hair growth were evident in Tg-grafted mice shortly after grafting. Beginning at 20 days, Tg grafts developed large tumor-like masses that subsequently ulcerated (Figure 2A ). Histological analyses revealed hyperplasia and multiple epidermal invaginations into the dermis as early as 9 days after grafting (Figure 2B). These lesions were epidermal in nature, as judged by staining with a pan-cytokeratin antibody and by their expression of keratin 6, which is expressed anomalously in hyperproliferative states (Figure 2C). Donor origin of the tumors was confirmed by their expression of the Yap1 transgene (Figure 2D and Figure S1E). Overall, the morphological perturbations resembled those of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in situ in human (Figure 2B). By 42 days, full dermal invasion was evident, and this was associated with the rupture of the basement membrane (Figure 2E). At this stage, tumors resembled human sarcomatoid SCC, characterized by the presence of invasive atypical proliferating spindle cells intermingled with keratinized centers (Figure 2B and Figures S1F and S1G). As predicted from their morphology, invading cells stained mostly negative for keratin markers but expressed the mesenchymal marker vimentin, indicating a potential epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a common occurrence in advanced human SCC (Figure 2E). Tumors were also assessed for their renewal by performing secondary transfers by subcutaneous injection into Nude mice. All transplantations gave rise to large masses of similar morphology as their primary counterparts (Figure S1H). Our results here demonstrate that proper regulation of Yap1 activity is essential for tumor suppression in the epidermis. To test the role of endogenous Yap1 in epidermal biology, we generated a conditional floxed (fl) allele of Yap1 by gene targeting (Figure S2A ). Deletion of loxP-flanked exons 1 and 2 of Yap1 after breeding to K14-Cre mice resulted in epidermis lacking Yap1 protein (Figures S2B–S2D). K14-Cre Yap1(fl/fl) mice will be referred to as cKO mice hereafter. cKO mice were either aborted or died shortly after birth. Gross examination of mutant embryos at E18.5 revealed thinner and fragile skin and absence of epidermal tissue covering the distal part of the limbs (Figure 3A ). Assessment of skin permeability using the toluidine blue dye revealed a complete loss of epidermal barrier function in the regions described and around the mouth and nose (Figure 3B). Histological analyses of the proximal limb skin of cKO mice revealed a thinner epidermis, reduced stratum corneum, and disorganized epidermal architecture (Figure 3C). Notably, the basal layer was hypoplastic, and basal cells had lost their columnar organization and adopted a flat morphology, typical of suprabasal differentiated cells (Figure 3C). These phenotypes were also observed in the back skin of cKO mice but were less severe.Figure 3Yap1 Is Required for the Maintenance of the Proliferative Capacity of Epidermal Stem CellsShow full caption(A) Gross morphology of representative control (Ctr) and cKO E18.5 embryos.

https://openalex.org/W2160697936,"A hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the preferential loss of substantia nigra dopamine neurons. Here, we identify a new parkin interacting substrate, PARIS (ZNF746), whose levels are regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system via binding to and ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, parkin. PARIS is a KRAB and zinc finger protein that accumulates in models of parkin inactivation and in human PD brain. PARIS represses the expression of the transcriptional coactivator, PGC-1α and the PGC-1α target gene, NRF-1 by binding to insulin response sequences in the PGC-1α promoter. Conditional knockout of parkin in adult animals leads to progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in a PARIS-dependent manner. Moreover, overexpression of PARIS leads to the selective loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra, and this is reversed by either parkin or PGC-1α coexpression. The identification of PARIS provides a molecular mechanism for neurodegeneration due to parkin inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2033778615,"The way we talk about complex and abstract ideas is suffused with metaphor. In five experiments, we explore how these metaphors influence the way that we reason about complex issues and forage for further information about them. We find that even the subtlest instantiation of a metaphor (via a single word) can have a powerful influence over how people attempt to solve social problems like crime and how they gather information to make “well-informed” decisions. Interestingly, we find that the influence of the metaphorical framing effect is covert: people do not recognize metaphors as influential in their decisions; instead they point to more “substantive” (often numerical) information as the motivation for their problem-solving decision. Metaphors in language appear to instantiate frame-consistent knowledge structures and invite structurally consistent inferences. Far from being mere rhetorical flourishes, metaphors have profound influences on how we conceptualize and act with respect to important societal issues. We find that exposure to even a single metaphor can induce substantial differences in opinion about how to solve social problems: differences that are larger, for example, than pre-existing differences in opinion between Democrats and Republicans."
https://openalex.org/W2034605152,"The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a highly conserved protein kinase and a central controller of growth. Mammalian TOR complex 2 (mTORC2) regulates AGC kinase family members and is implicated in various disorders, including cancer and diabetes. Here, we investigated the upstream regulation of mTORC2. A genetic screen in yeast and subsequent studies in mammalian cells revealed that ribosomes, but not protein synthesis, are required for mTORC2 signaling. Active mTORC2 was physically associated with the ribosome, and insulin-stimulated PI3K signaling promoted mTORC2-ribosome binding, suggesting that ribosomes activate mTORC2 directly. Findings with melanoma and colon cancer cells suggest that mTORC2-ribosome association is important in oncogenic PI3K signaling. Thus, TORC2-ribosome interaction is a likely conserved mechanism of TORC2 activation that is physiologically relevant in both normal and cancer cells. As ribosome content determines growth capacity of a cell, this mechanism of TORC2 regulation ensures that TORC2 is active only in growing cells."

Here, we demonstrate that introduction of minute quantities of misfolded preformed Tau fibrils (Tau pffs) into Tau-expressing cells rapidly recruit large amounts of soluble Tau into filamentous inclusions resembling NFTs with unprecedented efficiency, suggesting a “seeding”-recruitment process as a highly plausible mechanism underlying NFT formation in vivo. Consistent with the emerging concept of prion-like transmissibility of disease-causing amyloidogenic proteins, we found that spontaneous uptake of Tau pffs into cells is likely mediated by endocytosis, suggesting a potential mechanism for the propagation of Tau lesions in tauopathy brains. Furthermore, sequestration of soluble Tau by pff-induced Tau aggregates attenuates microtubule overstabilization in Tau-expressing cells, supporting the hypothesis of a Tau loss-of-function toxicity in cells harboring NFTs. In summary, our study establishes a cellular system that robustly develops authentic NFT-like Tau aggregates, which provides mechanistic insights into NFT pathogenesis and a potential tool for identifying Tau-based therapeutics.

A naturally unfolded soluble protein under normal conditions, Tau acquires highly ordered β-pleated sheet structures as it assembles into insoluble, hyperphosphorylated 15–20 nm in diameter paired helical filaments as well as less frequent straight filaments that constitute NFTs in AD and related tauopathies (11Kidd M.

Acta. 2005; 1739: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) strongly suggest a causal link between Tau abnormality and neuronal dysfunction. Although the exact mechanisms of Tau-mediated neurodegeneration are not well understood, both the loss of the MT-binding function of Tau due to sequestration of soluble Tau into tangles and the toxic gains of function because of the sheer physical occupancy of large intracellular aggregates have been proposed to explain the dire consequences of Tau aggregation (19Lee V.M.-Y. Daughenbaugh R. Trojanowski J.Q. Neurobiol. Aging. 1994; 15: S87-S89Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Ballatore C. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). A cellular system recapitulating features of tauopathies would provide a useful tool to study the cause and consequences of Tau aggregation. However, because Tau is a highly soluble protein, overexpressed Tau resists aggregation despite spontaneous hyperphosphorylation in most cell lines. Moreover, high expression of Tau overstabilizes MTs and inhibits cell division, and it is therefore not well tolerated by dividing cultured cells (21Kanai Y. Takemura R. Oshima T. Mori H. Ihara Y. Yanagisawa M. Masaki T. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 22Vogelsberg-Ragaglia V. Bruce J. Richter-Landsberg C. Zhang B. Hong M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4093-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, our current understanding of Tau fibrillization has relied on studies using cell-free systems in which the formation of Tau amyloid fibrils is greatly enhanced by polyanionic factors (23Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 24Kampers T. Friedhoff P. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25644-25650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the MT-binding repeats of Tau are both necessary and sufficient for in vitro fibrillization, and the repeat domain alone assembles into fibrils more readily than full-length Tau (26Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Importantly, Tau fibril assembly occurs by a nucleation-dependent mechanism, whereby the formation of oligomeric intermediates constitutes an initial lag phase followed by a relatively rapid elongation phase (27Friedhoff P. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E.M. Davies P. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 15712-15717Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Therefore, “seeding” Tau fibrillization reactions with preformed Tau fibrils (Tau pffs) can bypass the rate-limiting nucleation step and accelerate fibrillization of monomeric Tau. We hypothesized that similar seeding strategies could be employed to promote Tau aggregation in cultured cells, and in fact, several recent cell culture studies have demonstrated induction of intracellular aggregates by exogenously derived amyloid fibrils from several disease proteins involved in neurodegenerative disorders, including Tau (28Ren P.H.

Chem. 2010; 285: 34885-34898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Moreover, two recent studies on transgenic mice demonstrated the induction of WT Tau pathology by injection of brain extracts containing mutant Tau aggregates (32Clavaguera F. Bolmont T. Crowther R.A. Abramowski D. Frank S. Probst A. Fraser G. Stalder A.K. Beibel M. Staufenbiel M. Jucker M. Goedert M. Tolnay M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar) or by expression of truncated Tau that is aggregation-prone (33de Calignon A. Fox L.M. Pitstick R. Carlson G.A. Bacskai B.J. Spires-Jones T.L. Hyman B.T. Nature. 2010; 464: 1201-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), exemplifying the in vivo relevance of seeded aggregation of Tau. However, although two previous studies claimed to have demonstrated the recruitment of soluble Tau into insoluble aggregates in cultured cells (29Frost B. Jacks R.L. Diamond M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12845-12852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 31Nonaka T. Watanabe S.T. Iwatsubo T. Hasegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 34885-34898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), it is unclear if these Tau aggregates resemble NFTs. Here, we provide unequivocal evidence for the seeding phenomenon in cultured cells by demonstrating high efficiency recruitment of soluble Tau into authentic NFT-like aggregates. Furthermore, the establishment of a cellular system with a significant number of NFT-like aggregates enables investigation on the pathological mechanisms of Tau tangle formation as well as cellular transmission of pathological Tau, which are more difficult to study in animal models. BioPORTER® QuikeaseTM protein delivery kit for fibril transduction, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies used in this study are listed and described in supplemental Table 1. The cDNAs coding for 1) the longest isoform of Tau (2N4R) with a Myc tag at the 3′ end (3′Myc-T40), 2) truncated Tau containing only four MT-binding repeats with a Myc tag at the 5′ end (5′Myc-K18), and 3) 5′Myc-K18 containing P301L mutation (5′Myc-K18/P301L) were cloned into NdeI/EcoRI sites in pRK172 bacterial expression vector. Each protein was expressed in BL21 (DE3) RIL cells and purified by cationic exchange using a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) column as described previously (34Li W. Lee V.M.-Y. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15692-15701Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In vitro fibrillization was conducted by mixing 40 μm recombinant Tau with 40 μm low molecular weight heparin and 2 mm DTT in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0). Except 3′Myc-T40, which was agitated at 1,000 rpm for 5 days, the other proteins were incubated at 37 °C without shaking for 2–3 days. Successful fibrillization was confirmed using thioflavin T fluorescence assay, sedimentation tests, and negative stain electron microscopy (supplemental Fig. S1) as described previously (34Li W. Lee V.M.-Y. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15692-15701Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Before being used for transduction on cells, fibrillization mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in equal volume of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0), without heparin and DTT, and frozen as single use aliquots at −80 °C. QBI-293 cells (QBiogene) were grown in full media (DMEM, 10% FBS) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and l-glutamine. For fibril transduction, cells were plated at 400,000/well in a 6-well tissue culture plate 1 day before transient transfection with WT or mutant Tau in pcDNA5/TO or pcDNA3.1(+) using FuGENE® 6 (Roche Applied Science) as per manufacturer's instructions at 2 μg of DNA per well. About 16 h after transfection, resuspended fibril aliquots were diluted into 10 μm using 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) and sonicated with 20–30 pulses, 80 μl of which was added to one tube of BioPORTER reagent, gently vortexed for 5 s, and allowed to stand at room temperature for 5–10 min. During the formation of the pffs-reagent complex, cells were washed once with 2 ml of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) and placed on 500 μl of OptiMEM before the fibril-reagent complex was diluted with 420 μl of OptiMEM and added to cells. For experiments performed on cells plated on 12-well plates, all reagents were reduced by half. Six to seven hours after the addition of fibrils, cells were placed on starvation medium (DMEM, 0.5% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, l-glutamine) to reduce cell division, 24 h after which they were washed once with Versene/EDTA, incubated with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C to remove the majority of membrane-associated fibrils, and replated to poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips for immunostaining. Fixing was performed one night after replating. For fibril alone transduction without BioPORTER reagent, cells were placed on starvation medium right before the addition of fibrils. Fibrils were processed in exactly the same way, and the same amount was used as in reagent-mediated transduction. Cells were trypsinized and replated either 4 or 30 h after the initial addition of fibrils. For experiments using WGA, different doses of WGA were added to starvation medium together with pffs. To inhibit endocytosis of WGA, 0.1 m GlcNAc was incubated with medium containing pffs and 10 μg/ml WGA for 1 h at 37 °C before being added to cells that were preincubated in 0.1 m GlcNAc-containing medium for 1 h. Cells were placed on WGA-free starvation medium 5–6 h after fibril addition and fixed after overnight incubation to minimize possible toxicity resulted from WGA treatment. No replating was done for biochemical analysis except for experiments attempting to quantify cell-associated pffs (Fig. 7F) and 4 h fibril-alone transduction experiments (Fig. 7C) in which cells were transferred to new 6-well plates after the incubation period. Immunocytochemistry was performed 48 h after the initial addition of fibrils unless indicated otherwise. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min or fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min to remove soluble proteins. For visualization of microtubules, cells were fixed with 0.3% glutaraldehyde in PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2) for 10 min, extracted with 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min before being quenched with 10 mg/ml sodium borohydride for 7 min, followed by 0.1 m glycine for 20 min. After blocking with 3% BSA and 3% FBS for at least 1 h at room temperature, cells were incubated with specific primary antibodies (see supplemental Table 1) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C followed by staining with appropriate Alexa Fluor 594- or 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse/rabbit/mouse IgG1/mouse IgG2b) for 1–3 h at room temperature. DAPI was added to PBS wash to label cell nuclei. For ThS staining, cells were incubated with 0.005% ThS for 8 min and differentiated with 70% ethanol four times for 5 min each. Two-stage immunostaining was employed to distinguish between membrane-associated and truly internalized pffs. Live cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc Ab diluted in medium containing 25 mm HEPES for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes with cold medium, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Following blocking, cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-Myc Ab 9E10 for 1–2 h at room temperature. Rabbit Myc Ab is expected to bind to cell membrane-associated pffs only, where 9E10 would bind to both membrane-associated and intracellular pffs; therefore, truly internalized pffs should only be recognized by 9E10 but not rabbit Myc Ab. Epifluorescence images were acquired using Olympus BX 51 microscope (B&B Microscopes) equipped with a digital camera DP71 (Olympus) and DP manager (Olympus). Cells were washed once with PBS before being scraped into Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.6)) or Sarkosyl lysis buffer (1% Sarkosyl in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.6)) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and incubated on ice for 10–15 min. For Sarkosyl extraction, lysates were rotated at room temperature for 1 h before the next step. Following sonication, lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were kept as “Triton/Sarkosyl fraction,” whereas pellets were washed once in Triton/Sarkosyl lysis buffer, resuspended, and sonicated in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.6)). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 22 °C, supernatants were saved as “SDS fraction.” Equal proportions of Triton/Sarkosyl and SDS fractions were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked in 5% milk in TBS before probing with specific Abs (see supplemental Table 1). Protein-free block (ThermoFisher) was used for PHF-1 blots. Reagent-mediated transduction was performed as described above. One day after transduction, cells were placed on methionine-free medium for 15 min and then pulsed with methionine-free medium containing [35S]methionine (150 μCi for each well on 12-well plate) for 20 min, following which cells were switched into complete medium containing 5 mm cold methionine and chased for different durations. During harvest, cells were washed once in Hanks' balanced salt solution and sequentially extracted using 1% Triton X-100 followed by 1% SDS lysis buffer. Tau was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using a combination of mAbs T46 and Tau 5. To visualize pffs made in vitro, 6 μl of unsonicated or sonicated fibrils was placed on 300 meshed Formvar/carbon film-coated copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 3 min, washed twice with 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.6) for 5 min each, stained with 10–15 drops of 2% uranyl acetate, and visualized with Jeol 1010 transmission electron microscope (Peabody). Immuno-EM of reagent alone-treated cells and fibril-transduced cells were performed as described previously (30Luk K.C. Song C. O'Brien P. Stieber A. Branch J.R. Brunden K.R. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20051-20056Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) using PHF-1 as the primary antibody. Levels of acetylated tubulin (Ac-tub) and Tau in cell lysates were quantified using sandwich ELISA in 384-well plate format. For Ac-tub ELISA, tubulin mAb 12G10 was used as the capture antibody, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated Ac-tub mAb was used as the reporting antibody. Standard curves were generated using serially diluted brain lysates from WT mice. 18 μg of cell lysates diluted in EC buffer (0.02 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 2 mm EDTA, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.2% BSA, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.4% Blockace, 0.05% NaN3) was loaded to each well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following day, after 4 h of incubation with reporting antibody at room temperature, trimethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate solution was added, and the plate was read using SpectraMax at 450 nm absorbance. For quantifying Tau in Triton and SDS fractions, cell lysates from sequential extraction were diluted 1000 times in EC buffer. Serially diluted recombinant human T40 was used to generate standard curves. 30 μl of diluted samples were loaded into each well of the plate coated with capture antibody Tau 5. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, captured proteins were reported using biotin-labeled BT2 and HT7, which were left to incubate overnight at 4 °C. The next day, following 1 h of incubation with HRP-conjugated streptavidin at 25 °C, the plate was developed using trimethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate solution. For quantifying the percentage of cells developing Tau aggregates with different combinations of endogenous Tau and pffs, 10–20 random-field images were taken at ×40 magnification for each combination, and at least two independent experiments were performed. For quantification of MT bundling and pff alone-induced Tau aggregation under various conditions (i.e. different temperatures, with or without WGA/GlcNAc), 10 random-field images were taken at ×20 magnification for each condition in each experiment, and 3–4 independent experiments were performed. Two-tailed paired Student's t test was used for all the comparisons in the study, and differences with p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. To explore the capability of Tau pffs to seed intracellular fibrillization of soluble Tau, QBI-293 cells were transiently transfected with wild type T40 (WT-T40), the longest human Tau isoform (2N4R), and transduced with pffs generated from Myc-tagged full-length human Tau (Myc-T40) or truncated Tau containing only the four MT-binding repeats (Myc-K18) (supplemental Fig. S1) using BioPORTER protein delivery reagent. Unlike WT-T40-expressing cells treated with transduction reagent alone, in which phosphorylated Tau recognized by monoclonal antibody (mAb) PHF-1 (Ser(P)-396/404) was completely soluble and extracted by 1% Triton X-100 during fixation (Fig. 1A), cells transduced with either Myc-T40 or Myc-K18 Tau pffs showed accumulations of Triton-insoluble fibrillar phospho-Tau aggregates (Fig. 1B). These induced aggregates were also detected by anti-phospho-Tau mAb AT8 (Ser(P)-202/Thr(P)-205) and conformation-dependent mAb MC-1 (Fig. 1C), which specifically recognizes Tau in a pathological conformation (35Jicha G.A. Bowser R. Kazam I.G. Davies P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Interestingly, pff-induced aggregates exhibited a variety of morphologies, ranging from widely distributed short fibrils, skein-like accumulations, to localized dense NFT-like inclusions and sometimes a mixture of phenotypes (Fig. 1C). Significantly, double labeling immunofluorescence in WT-T40-expressing cells using anti-Myc antibody to detect Myc-K18 and Myc-T40 pffs and PHF-1 to detect phosphorylated T40 showed that anti-Myc only labeled a fraction of the fibrils detected by PHF1, thus supporting a seeding and recruitment mechanism of Tau aggregate formation (Fig. 1B). Moreover, phosphorylated Tau was nonexistent or rare in nontransfected cells transduced with Myc-T40 pffs, suggesting a lack of phosphorylation of internalized full-length fibrils (data not shown). Furthermore, because epitopes recognized by these three Tau-specific mAbs (PHF-1, AT8, and MC-1) are absent from Myc-K18, their immunoreactivities in Myc-K18 fibril-transduced cells can be entirely attributed to endogenously expressed WT-T40. Thus, exogenously supplied Tau pffs do not constitute the insoluble phospho-Tau species we detect in WT-T40 cells treated with pffs. Finally, accumulation of insoluble Tau aggregates failed to occur when pffs were transduced into cells expressing fibrillization-incompetent Tau with K311D mutation (data not shown), further confirming the de novo fibrillization of soluble Tau in WT-T40-expressing cells. To assess the efficacy of recruitment by pffs of 4R Tau, with or without N-terminal inserts, as well as disease-associated mutant Tau, fibril transduction was performed on QBI-293 cells transiently transfected with human T43 (0N4R), T40/ΔK280 (FTDP-17 mutation in the MT-binding domain), T40/P301L (FTDP-17 mutation in the MT-binding domain), and T40/R406W (FTDP-17 mutation outside the MT-binding domain). Quantification of the percentage of aggregate-bearing cells induced by these various combinations revealed a similar extent of aggregation in T43- and T40-transfected cells upon Myc-K18 fibril transduction (about 8% of cells had aggregates with either treatment), suggesting the number of N-terminal inserts does not affect fibrillization (Table 1). Among the dominantly inherited Tau mutations in FTDP-17 studied here, T40 with the P301L mutation demonstrated the highest propensity of pff-induced aggregation. Specifically, transduction of Myc-K18 pffs and Myc-K18 pffs with P301L mutation (Myc-K18/P301L fibrils) led to about 20 and 35% of cells bearing aggregates, respectively (Table 1), corresponding to ∼40 and ∼70% of the transfected cells assuming 50% transfection efficiency (Fig. 2A). Although Myc-K18/P301L fibrils appeared to be better “seeds” for T40/P301L recruitment as monitored by number of aggregate-bearing cells, they were comparable with, or even slightly less efficient than, Myc-K18 fibrils in nucleating the fibrillization of WT-T40 (Table 1). Enhanced aggregation of T40/P301L as compared with WT-T40 corresponded to significantly more accumulation of Triton-insoluble Tau as shown on immunoblots (compare Fig. 2B with supplemental Fig. S2B). The induced Tau aggregates were also Sarkosyl-insoluble, with the immunoblot of Sarkosyl extraction indistinguishable from that of Triton extraction (supplemental Fig. S3).TABLE 1% of aggregate-bearing cells with specific combinations of endogenous Tau transfection and fibril transductionFibrilsTransfectionWTT40 (2N4R)T43 (0N4R)T40/P301LT40/ΔK280T40/R406W%5′myc-K18∼8∼8∼20∼5∼65′myc-K18/P301L∼5NTaNT means not tested.∼35NTNTa NT means not tested. Open table in a new tab Quantification by Tau sandwich ELISA indicated that Myc-K18/P301L pffs always resulted in higher amounts of Triton-insoluble T40/P301L Tau than Myc-K18 pffs, confirming a more efficient recruitment of soluble Tau with the combination of Myc-K18/P301L pffs and T40/P301L-expressing cells (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, both Myc-K18 and Myc-K18/P301L pff transduction on T40/P301L-expressing cells invariably led to a reduction of Triton-soluble Tau when compared with nontransduced cells, further supporting that the accumulation of insoluble Tau is through sequestration/recruitment of soluble Tau. Intriguingly, live immunostaining followed by immunofluorescence after fixation and permeabilization (two-stage staining) revealed that the majority of pffs associated with cells were merely membrane-associated despite extensive trypsinization before replating cells to coverslips, and only a small amount of pffs were truly internalized (Fig. 3A). Moreover, double labeling using anti-Myc antibody and PHF-1 in cells extracted with 1% Triton X-100 showed that less than half of the induced aggregates contained detectable colocalizing pffs (Fig. 3B), suggesting that small amounts of pff seeds are sufficient to induce robust endogenous Tau fibrillization.

Formation of the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate recombination results in the accumulation of Spo11 protein covalently bound to small DNA fragments. By sequencing these fragments, we uncover a genome-wide DSB map of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. We use this map to explore how DSB distribution is influenced by large-scale chromosome structures, chromatin, transcription factors, and local sequence composition. Our analysis offers mechanistic insight into DSB formation and early processing steps, supporting the view that the recombination terrain is molded by combinatorial and hierarchical interaction of factors that work on widely different size scales. This map illuminates the occurrence of DSBs in repetitive DNA elements, repair of which can lead to chromosomal rearrangements. We also discuss implications for evolutionary dynamics of recombination hot spots."

Microbiol. 2008; 6: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) due to the complexity of curative treatment regimens (Connolly et al., 2007Connolly L.E. Edelstein P.H. Ramakrishnan L.

Antituberculosis drugs.in: Schaaf H. Zumla A. Tuberculosis: A Comprehensive Clinical Reference. Saunders Elsevier, London, UK2009: 608-617Crossref Google Scholar). Long-term therapy is required to prevent relapses with genetically drug-sensitive bacilli that become transiently resistant in the host, a phenomenon called tolerance. The best-case regimen of six months was made possible by drug combinations that presumably reduce the tolerant population (Donald and McIlleron, 2009Donald P.R. McIlleron H. Antituberculosis drugs.in: Schaaf H. Zumla A. Tuberculosis: A Comprehensive Clinical Reference. Saunders Elsevier, London, UK2009: 608-617Crossref Google Scholar). This so-called “short course therapy” represented a major advance, as prior regimens lasted 12–18 months. However, adherence to 6 months of multidrug treatment is difficult, leading to relapses that perpetuate the epidemic and fuel the development of genetic resistance (Sacchettini et al., 2008Sacchettini J.C. Rubin E.J. Freundlich J.S. Drugs versus bugs: in pursuit of the persistent predator Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome tolerance (Connolly et al., 2007Connolly L.E. Edelstein P.H. Ramakrishnan L.

Several new drugs are in development (Sacchettini et al., 2008Sacchettini J.C. Rubin E.J. Freundlich J.S. Drugs versus bugs: in pursuit of the persistent predator Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Nat. Rev.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) resides within complex immunological structures called granulomas, either within macrophages or extracellularly, in the necrotic core (caseum) (Figure S1 available online) (Barry et al., 2009Barry III, C.E. Boshoff H.I. Dartois V. Dick T. Ehrt S. Flynn J. Schnappinger D. Wilkinson R.J. Young D. The spectrum of latent tuberculosis: rethinking the biology and intervention strategies.Nat. Rev.

Multiple granuloma types, reflecting different levels of local disease activity, may coexist in a given patient (Figure S1) (Barry et al., 2009Barry III, C.E. Boshoff H.I. Dartois V. Dick T. Ehrt S.

Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, IL1946Google Scholar). A longstanding model is that tolerant bacteria are sequestered in a subset of granulomas wherein their replication and metabolism are uniformly slowed (Figure S1) (Barry et al., 2009Barry III, C.E. Boshoff H.I. Dartois V. Dick T. Ehrt S. Flynn J. Schnappinger D. Wilkinson R.J. Young D. The spectrum of latent tuberculosis: rethinking the biology and intervention strategies.Nat. Rev.

Why is long-term therapy required to cure tuberculosis?.PLoS Med. 2007; 4: e120Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Newer models posit that quiescent, drug-tolerant bacteria are present in all lesion types and may be induced by deterministic mechanisms that are responsive to stress (e.g., hypoxia) and/or the stochastic formation of persister cells, some of which may be nonculturable under standard laboratory conditions (Figure S1) (Barry et al., 2009Barry III, C.E.

However, all tolerance models and consequently drug discovery efforts are centered on the assumption that slowed growth and/or metabolic quiescence is the primary mediator of tolerance. In this study, we demonstrate that growing mycobacteria develop multidrug tolerance soon after they infect macrophages. This understanding was gained by a two-pronged approach. First, we used zebrafish larvae infected with Mycobacterium marinum (Mm) to spatially and temporally characterize the responses of individual animals to frontline antitubercular drugs. Mm infections feature drug tolerance and require long-term treatment in both humans and fish (Aubry et al., 2002Aubry A. Chosidow O. Caumes E. Robert J. Cambau E. Sixty-three cases of Mycobacterium marinum infection: clinical features, treatment, and antibiotic susceptibility of causative isolates.Arch. Intern. Med. 2002; 162: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, Decostere et al., 2004Decostere A. Hermans K. Haesebrouck F. Piscine mycobacteriosis: a literature review covering the agent and the disease it causes in fish and humans.Vet. Microbiol. 2004; 99: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Using the larval model, we discovered that tolerant bacteria arise within individual macrophages soon after infection and are then expanded and disseminated by tuberculous granulomas. Guided by these findings, we used cultured macrophage infection models combined with bacterial efflux pump mutants and pharmacological inhibitors to identify both a mechanism and a therapy for macrophage-induced tolerance in TB. To assess antitubercular drug activity in the model, we infected larvae intravenously with GFP-expressing Mm and maintained them in the presence of antitubercular drugs. Concentrations that represented multiples of the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Mm were used, and the drug-supplemented water was changed daily (Table S1, Figures S2A–S2E , and Experimental Procedures). We established minimal isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB), and moxifloxacin (MOX) concentrations that were nontoxic and normalized host survival when administered within 1 day postinfection (dpi), which we term the minimum effective concentration (MEC) (Figure 1A , Figures S2B–S2E, Table S1, and Table S2). Bacterial burdens of infected larvae can be assessed visually by fluorescence microscopy or quantitatively by larval lysis and enumeration of bacterial colony-forming units (CFU). To facilitate rapid, serial quantification of bacterial burden, we developed software that enumerates fluorescent pixels in images of infected larvae, or fluorescent pixel count (FPC), and showed it to be an accurate predictor of bacterial burden (Figure S3 and Experimental Procedures). Increased survival was associated with lower bacterial burdens at 4 days posttreatment (dpt), as judged by fluorescence microscopy, and was confirmed quantitatively by FPC and CFU analyses (Figures 1A–1F, Figure S3, and Table S2). Findings that were consistent with human TB data were also obtained with streptomycin (STM, Figures S2C–S2E), which has resurged as a cornerstone of treatment for extremely drug-resistant (XDR) TB (Donald and McIlleron, 2009Donald P.R. McIlleron H. Antituberculosis drugs.in: Schaaf H. Zumla A. Tuberculosis: A Comprehensive Clinical Reference. Saunders Elsevier, London, UK2009: 608-617Crossref Google Scholar). In summary, clinically relevant antitubercular drugs were efficacious in the zebrafish infection model, with the expected exception of pyrazinamide, to which Mm is innately resistant (Figures S2F and S2G).Figure 1The Mm-Larval Zebrafish Infection Model Replicates the Specificity and Activity of Clinically Relevant Antitubercular DrugsShow full caption(A–D) Larvae were soaked in the MEC of RIF (388 μM), MOX (62.3 μM), EMB (1442 μM), or INH (290 μM) (Table S1).(A) Survival of uninfected (UN) larvae versus those infected with 800 Mm and immediately treated with RIF, MOX, EMB, INH, or left untreated (UNT).

(E) Correlation between mean log10 FPC and mean log10 CFU counts from populations shown in Figure 1C and 1D. Pearson's Coefficient of Correlation (r) = 0.9341, p = 0.0659. (F) To determine the detection sensitivity of stationary phase Mm, light (left panel) and heavy (right panel) inocula of Mm (OD600 of 1.8) were injected into 30 hr postfertilization larvae which were imaged immediately at the same settings used in (C). By fluorimetry, stationary phase Mm/pmsp12::gfp expresses ∼20% of the fluorescence of logarithmic phase bacteria, yet are still readily visualized by microscopy. Furthermore, FPC analysis counts fluorescent pixels above a user defined threshold, regardless of intensity. Therefore, all bacteria will count equally, independent of their level of GFP expression and thereby of their growth phase. To further probe the model's relevance to human TB, we used the MECs as starting points from which to examine drug potency and dose-dependent activity. In human pulmonary TB studies, the early bactericidal activity (EBA) of antitubercular drugs, defined as their ability to reduce sputum bacterial counts in pulmonary TB patients over the first several days, has been useful to guide drug dosing (Donald and Diacon, 2008Donald P.R. Diacon A.H. The early bactericidal activity of anti-tuberculosis drugs: a literature review.Tuberculosis (Edinb.). 2008; 88: S75-S83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, Jindani et al., 2003Jindani A. Doré C.J. Mitchison D.A. Bactericidal and sterilizing activities of antituberculosis drugs during the first 14 days.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 167: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Each drug has distinctive EBA characteristics. For RIF, doses greater than the currently used therapeutic dose increase the EBA, raising the question of whether higher doses would have greater efficacy (Donald and Diacon, 2008Donald P.R. Diacon A.H. The early bactericidal activity of anti-tuberculosis drugs: a literature review.Tuberculosis (Edinb.). 2008; 88: S75-S83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the larvae, treatment with the RIF MEC caused a 1.2 log10 reduction in bacterial burden, whereas treatment with twice the MEC caused an additional 1.2 log10 reduction despite increased toxicity (Figures 1E–1G). We similarly observed dose-dependent activity for MOX: stepwise increases in concentration produced greater diminutions in bacterial burdens (Figure S2H). In contrast to RIF, INH EBA does not increase when the conventional dose is doubled. We also observed no further reduction in bacterial counts at double the INH MEC (data not shown). Further, stepwise 2-fold reductions from the conventional dose continue to show activity in human TB, with a graded EBA decrease down to 1/16th the therapeutic dose (Donald and Diacon, 2008Donald P.R. Diacon A.H. The early bactericidal activity of anti-tuberculosis drugs: a literature review.Tuberculosis (Edinb.). 2008; 88: S75-S83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found a graded concentration-dependent bactericidal activity down to 1/24th the MEC (Figures 1H and 1I) and a therapeutic benefit at 1/5th the MEC (Figure 1J). Finally, because drug-resistant TB is an increasing problem (Sacchettini et al., 2008Sacchettini J.C. Rubin E.J. Freundlich J.S. Drugs versus bugs: in pursuit of the persistent predator Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), we asked whether the model could differentiate Mm strains with altered drug susceptibility. INH resistance is usually the first to occur in human TB and often the first step in the progression to XDR TB (Donald and McIlleron, 2009Donald P.R. McIlleron H. Antituberculosis drugs.in: Schaaf H. Zumla A. Tuberculosis: A Comprehensive Clinical Reference. Saunders Elsevier, London, UK2009: 608-617Crossref Google Scholar). INH is a prodrug activated by the bacterial catalase KatG, and the vast majority of INH-resistant clinical Mtb isolates have katG mutations (Sandgren et al., 2009Sandgren A. Strong M. Muthukrishnan P. Weiner B.K. Church G.M. Murray M.B. Tuberculosis drug resistance mutation database.PLoS Med. 2009; 6: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). We identified a spontaneous INH-resistant Mm katG mutant with an in vitro INH MIC of 464 μM, 8-fold higher than for wild-type (Figure 1K and Extended Experimental Procedures). The relative resistance of the Mm katG mutant was detectable in vivo: in larvae infected with wild-type Mm, maximal bacterial killing was observed at 290 μM, whereas an 8-fold higher concentration was ineffective against the katG mutant (Figure 1L). INH resistance was specific: EMB, which has a distinct target (Belanger et al., 1996Belanger A.E. Besra G.S. Ford M.E. Mikusová K. Belisle J.T. Brennan P.J. Inamine J.M. The embAB genes of Mycobacterium avium encode an arabinosyl transferase involved in cell wall arabinan biosynthesis that is the target for the antimycobacterial drug ethambutol.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 11919-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), showed similar efficacy against both strains (Figure 1L). In summary, the zebrafish larval model reliably replicates the activity of antitubercular compounds and their dosing characteristics in humans. Our observation that residual cultivatable bacteria persisted 4 dpt, despite initiating treatment within a day of infection when the bacteria were in individual macrophages (Figures 1B–1D), suggested the early presence of drug-tolerant bacteria, prior to granuloma formation. We pursued this observation in detail for INH because its tolerance in human TB has been studied extensively (Donald and Diacon, 2008Donald P.R. Diacon A.H.

We confirmed that the residual bacteria were tolerant, rather than genetically resistant, to INH: the INH susceptibility of individual bacilli recovered from six treated larvae (10.3 ± 1.2 CFU per larva) was unchanged from the parental strain. INH tolerance is seen in human EBA studies in which monotherapy produces biphasic killing. The majority of the bacteria are killed with 2 days of treatment, after which the rate of killing drops, leaving a population of drug-tolerant bacteria 14 dpt (Figu"

The assembly of most ubiquitin chains is promoted by E2s, yet how these enzymes achieve linkage specificity is poorly understood. We have discovered that the K11-specific Ube2S orients the donor ubiquitin through an essential noncovalent interaction that occurs in addition to the thioester bond at the E2 active site. The E2-donor ubiquitin complex transiently recognizes the acceptor ubiquitin, primarily through electrostatic interactions. The recognition of the acceptor ubiquitin surface around Lys11, but not around other lysines, generates a catalytically competent active site, which is composed of residues of both Ube2S and ubiquitin. Our studies suggest that monomeric E2s promote linkage-specific ubiquitin chain formation through substrate-assisted catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2122858192,"Among breast cancers, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most poorly understood and is refractory to current targeted therapies. Using a genetic screen, we identify the PTPN12 tyrosine phosphatase as a tumor suppressor in TNBC. PTPN12 potently suppresses mammary epithelial cell proliferation and transformation. PTPN12 is frequently compromised in human TNBCs, and we identify an upstream tumor-suppressor network that posttranscriptionally controls PTPN12. PTPN12 suppresses transformation by interacting with and inhibiting multiple oncogenic tyrosine kinases, including HER2 and EGFR. The tumorigenic and metastatic potential of PTPN12-deficient TNBC cells is severely impaired upon restoration of PTPN12 function or combined inhibition of PTPN12-regulated tyrosine kinases, suggesting that TNBCs are dependent on the proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinases constrained by PTPN12. Collectively, these data identify PTPN12 as a commonly inactivated tumor suppressor and provide a rationale for combinatorially targeting proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinases in TNBC and other cancers based on their profile of tyrosine-phosphatase activity."

Salmonella requires Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling for intracellular survival TLR signaling enhances acidification of Salmonella-containing phagosomes Phagosome acidification induces expression of Salmonella's type 3 secretion system Innate immune signaling can serve as a contextual cue for virulence gene induction During early stages of infection the innate immune system is essential for limiting microbial replication and spread before an adaptive response is mounted. Accordingly, pathogens have evolved virulence strategies to antagonize innate immune function (Hedrick, 2004Hedrick S. The acquired immune system: A vantage from beneath.Immunity. 2004; 21: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Rausher, 2001Rausher M.D. Co-evolution and plant resistance to natural enemies.Nature. 2001; 411: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, Woolhouse et al., 2002Woolhouse M.E.

The interplay between host innate immune function and pathogen virulence mechanisms largely determines the outcome of most infections. Despite the logic of this conceptual framework, our understanding of the molecular interactions driving the emergence of virulence mechanisms remains relatively poor. Innate immune receptors detect infection by recognizing conserved microbial features common to broad classes of microbes (Janeway, 1989Janeway Jr., C.A. Approaching the asymptote?

Recognition of microorganisms and activation of the immune response.Nature. 2007; 449: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) target a range of microbial ligands, including lipopolysaccharide (TLR4), lipoproteins (TLR2), flagellin (TLR5), unmethylated CpG motifs in DNA (TLR9), double-stranded RNA (TLR3), and single-stranded RNA (TLR7 and TLR8) (Akira et al., 2001Akira S.

Immunol. 2005; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Expression of TLRs on innate immune cells links microbial recognition to induction of antimicrobial mechanisms, such as production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In addition, TLR activation can promote adaptive immunity through control of dendritic cell (DC) maturation (Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Toll-like receptor control of the adaptive immune responses.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). To study the evolution of pathogen virulence and its relationship to innate immunity, we have focused on TLR-mediated recognition of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. S. typhimurium is a gram-negative bacterium that can survive and replicate within host macrophages (Coburn et al., 2007Coburn B. Grassl G.A. Finlay B.B. Salmonella, the host and disease: a brief review.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2007; 85: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Survival within macrophages requires a set of genes, many of which are encoded within Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) (Galan, 2001Galan J.E.

Fluorescence-based isolation of bacterial genes expressed within host cells.Science. 1997; 277: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Translocation of SPI-2 effectors into the host cell transforms the phagosome into a compartment that supports bacterial replication, the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) (Marcus et al., 2000Marcus S.L.

Consistent with a central role for these receptors, S. typhimurium has evolved mechanisms to subvert this recognition or to avoid the consequences of TLR activation. For example, modification of lipid A by pagP reduces recognition by TLR4, although this modification is probably most relevant for resistance to AMPs (Bader et al., 2005Bader M.W. Sanowar S.

Mice lacking TLRs, especially TLR4, are more susceptible to S. typhimurium (Weiss et al., 2004Weiss D.S. Raupach B. Takeda K. Akira S. Zychlinsky A. Toll-like receptors are temporally involved in host defense.J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4463-4469PubMed Google Scholar). To circumvent the problem of redundancy, many studies have used mice lacking the common TLR adaptor MyD88 or lacking both MyD88 and another adaptor, TRIF (Hapfelmeier et al., 2005Hapfelmeier S. Stecher B. Barthel M. Kremer M. Müller A.J. Heikenwalder M. Stallmach T. Hensel M. Pfeffer K.

Although these mice are very susceptible to S. typhimurium, these studies suffer from the caveat that MyD88 is also required for signaling by members of the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) family. Because mice deficient in IL-1R are more susceptible to infection, the phenotype of MyD88 knockout (KO) mice cannot be unequivocally attributed to TLRs (Mayer-Barber et al., 2010Mayer-Barber K.D. Barber D.L. Shenderov K. White S.D. Wilson M.S. Cheever A. Kugler D. Hieny S. Caspar P. Nunez G. et al.Caspase-1 independent IL-1beta production is critical for host resistance to mycobacterium tuberculosis and does not require TLR signaling in vivo.J.

Immun. 2006; 74: 4922-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the studies described here, we sought to eliminate TLR-based recognition of S. typhimurium and examine the effect on pathogen virulence, while avoiding the caveats associated with MyD88-KO mice. In addition, we were concerned that the extreme susceptibility of C57Bl/6 mice (the genetic background on which most studies with TLR-KO mice have been performed) to S. typhimurium infection might mask any relationships between TLRs and bacterial virulence strategies. Many inbred mouse strains, including C57Bl/6, possess a nonfunctional allele of the nramp-1 gene. nramp-1 encodes a multipass transmembrane protein that localizes to lysosomes and functions as a transporter of divalent cations, and mice with the nonfunctional allele are extremely susceptible to a number of intracellular pathogens (Forbes and Gros, 2001Forbes J.R.

Natural resistance to intracellular infections: Nramp1 encodes a membrane phosphoglycoprotein absent in macrophages from susceptible (Nramp1 D169) mouse strains.J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3559-3568PubMed Google Scholar). To avoid the caveats associated with nonfunctional Nramp-1 and TLR-independent functions of MyD88, we generated mice with a functional allele of nramp1 that lack individual or multiple TLRs. Studies in these mice led to a striking finding. Whereas mice lacking a subset of the TLRs involved in S. typhimurium recognition showed increased susceptibility to infection, a lack of additional TLRs resulted in reduced susceptibility. The loss of virulence correlated with an inability of bacteria to survive and replicate within macrophages. We show that TLR signaling leads to rapid acidification of the SCV, and this signal is required for regulation of virulence gene expression. In the absence of this contextual cue, S. typhimurium is unable to survive and replicate intracellularly. Altogether, this work describes the molecular interactions underlying a bacterial pathogen's dependence on the innate immune system for virulence. To identify which TLRs are relevant for innate recognition of S. typhimurium, we utilized HEK293 reporter cell lines expressing an NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct. Stimulation of these cells with heat-killed bacteria resulted in robust induction of NF-κB, which we attributed to endogenous TLR5 expressed by these cells (Figure 1A ). This response was abrogated when cells were stimulated with bacteria lacking flagellin. To measure activation of other TLR family members, HEK293 reporter cells stably expressing individual TLRs were stimulated with bacteria lacking flagellin (to eliminate the contribution of endogenous TLR5). Using this approach, we observed activation of TLR2 and TLR4 by S. typhimurium (Figure 1A). Furthermore, S. typhimurium genomic DNA was capable of activating a surface-localized version of TLR9 (Figure 1A). Although these results confirmed that TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9 may play a role in recognition of S. typhimurium, they did not address the relative importance of each TLR during infection. To this end, we infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) lacking combinations of TLRs and measured production of nitric oxide (NO). In agreement with previously published studies, BMMs lacking both TLR2 and TLR4 (TLR2×4-KO) produced much less NO than wild-type BMMs (Figure 1B). The remaining response was partially dependent on TLR9, as BMMs lacking TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 (TLR2×4×9-KO) produced even less NO. Similar results were observed when tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) production was measured (Figure 1C). Importantly, all genotypes of BMMs responded equivalently to the TLR7 ligand R848, indicating that the cells were otherwise equivalent (Figure 1D and Figure S1 available online). The small amount of TNF and NO produced in TLR2×4×9-KO BMMs was dependent on other TLRs, as BMMs lacking both MyD88 and TRIF (and therefore all TLR-dependent signaling) did not respond to S. typhimurium (Figures 1B and 1C). As TLR5 is not expressed in murine BMMs, we reasoned that the residual TNF and NO produced by TLR2×4×9-KO BMMs was most likely due to TLR7 or TLR3 signaling. To address this possibility directly, we pretreated TLR2×4×9-KO BMMs with bafilomycinA1, an inhibitor of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) that prevents activation of endosomal TLRs. BafilomycinA1 treatment inhibited TNF production in TLR2×4-KO and TLR2×4×9-KO BMMs to almost background levels, suggesting that TLR7 and/or TLR3 are responsible for the remaining TNF production in response to S. typhimurium (Figure 1D). Collectively, these data indicate that TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, and TLR7 (and/or TLR3) each contribute to the recognition of S. typhimurium in infected BMMs. Having established which TLRs respond to ligands derived from S. typhiumurium in BMMs, we sought to test the effect of TLR deficiency on bacterial virulence in vivo. We crossed a functional allele of the nramp1 gene onto the C57BL/6 background and generated TLR-deficient or TLR-adaptor-deficient mice with functional Nramp1 (see Extended Experimental Procedures). We expected that reduced TLR function would lead to greater susceptibility to infection. Indeed, all TLR2×4-KO mice died within 16 days when challenged orally with S. typhimurium, whereas 75% of the wild-type mice survived for the duration of the experiment (Figure 2A ). By contrast, TLR2×4×9-KO mice were less susceptible to infection than TLR2×4-KO mice, despite a greater impairment in TLR function (Figure 2A). This increased survival was not a consequence of reduced immunopathology due to reduced TLR function. In fact, TLR2×4×9-KO mice had lower numbers of bacteria 4 days post-infection in spleens, livers, ceca, and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) relative to TLR2×4-KO mice (Figure 2B). Thus, despite less robust innate immune function, S. typhimurium was less virulent in TLR2×4×9-KO mice. The difference in susceptibility between TLR2×4-KO and TLR2×4×9-KO mice could indicate that TLR9 plays a negative role in immunity to S. typhimurium. To test this possibility, we challenged mice lacking TLR4 and TLR9 (TLR4×9-KO). We reasoned that if TLR9 were playing a negative role in immunity, then any genotype lacking TLR9 would be resistant to infection. Instead, TLR4×9-KO mice were as susceptible to infection as TLR2×4-KO mice, indicating that lack of TLR9 by itself does not confer increased resistance to infection (Figure 2A). Thus, the data presented suggest that overall TLR signaling is in some way required for S. typhimurium virulence. Despite this apparent requirement, MyD88-KO and MyD88×TRIF-KO mice (with wild-type Nramp1) were highly susceptible to S. typhimurium infection (Figure S2). As discussed earlier, the extreme sensitivity of these mice relative to TLR2×4×9-KO mice is likely due to the role of MyD88 downstream of the IL-1, IL-18, and IL-33 receptors (Mayer-Barber et al., 2010Mayer-Barber K.D. Barber D.L. Shenderov K. White S.D. Wilson M.S. Cheever A. Kugler D. Hieny S. Caspar P. Nunez G. et al.Caspase-1 independent IL-1beta production is critical for host resistance to mycobacterium tuberculosis and does not require TLR signaling in vivo.J.

Immun. 2006; 74: 4922-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, to examine the role for TLR signaling in S. typhimurium virulence, we must use TLR-deficient mice, not mice lacking common signaling adaptors. One potential caveat of these in vivo studies is that the commensal flora may be different between TLR2×4-KO and TLR2×4×9-KO mice. Recent studies have reported alterations in commensal communities in mice lacking certain TLRs or TLR-signaling adaptors (Vijay-Kumar et al., 2008Vijay-Kumar M. Aitken J.D. Kumar A. Neish A.S. Uematsu S. Akira S. Gewirtz A.T. Toll-like receptor 5-deficient mice have dysregulated intestinal gene expression and nonspecific resistance to Salmonella-induced typhoid-like disease.Infect.

Bluestone J.A. et al.Innate immunity and intestinal microbiota in the development of Type 1 diabetes.Nature. 2008; 455: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, we challenged mice with a different gram-negative enteric pathogen, Yersinia enterocolitica (Y. enterocolitica), which shares a similar route of intestinal colonization but remains extracellular after crossing the intestinal epithelia. In contrast to our experiments with S. typhimurium, TLR2×4×9-KO mice were equally, if not more, susceptible relative to TLR2×4-KO mice (Figure 2C). The differential sensitivity of TLR2×4×9-KO mice to these two enteric bacteria argues that alterations in commensal flora are not contributing to the phenotypes of TLR2×4-KO and TLR2×4×9-KO mice. Instead, the reduction in TLR signaling in TLR2×4×9-KO mice appears to specifically impact the virulence of S. typhimurium. Because survival within macrophages is required for systemic infection (Fields et al., 1986Fields P.I. Swanson R.V. Haidaris C.G. Heffron F.

Intracellular replication is essential for the virulence of Salmonella typhimurium.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88: 11470-11474Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), we next used a gentamicin protection assay to examine survival and replication in BMMs lacking various TLRs. Consistent with our in vivo experiments, S. typhimurium was able to replicate in TLR2×4-KO but not TLR2×4×9-KO BMMs (Figure 3A ). When we counted bacteria in individual BMMs by immunofluorescence microscopy (IF), the number of bacteria per cell in TLR2×4-KO BMMs accumulated over time, whereas the number of bacteria per cell in TLR2×4×9-KO BMMs remained constant, indicating that bacterial replication was responsible for the differences in colony-forming units (CFU) between genotypes (Figures 3B and 3C). We observed a similar lack of bacterial replication in MyD88×TRIF-KO BMMs (Figure 3A). Unlike our in vivo experiments, the phenotype of MyD88×TRIF-KO BMMs is most likely due to a deficiency in TLR signaling, as the IL-1 receptor family is not involved in the initial recognition of S. typhimurium within BMMs in vitro. Furthermore, TLR4×9-KO BMMs supported bacterial replication similarly to TLR2×4-KO BMMs, corroborating the conclusions from our in vivo experiments (Figures 3B and 3C). TLR2×4×9-KO and MyD88×TRIF-KO BMMs did support replication of Listeria monocytogenes and Legionella pneumophila (Figure S3). In addition, S. typhimurium replicated well in MyD88×TRIF-KO BMMs lacking functional Nramp1 (Figure S3). These results indicate that phagosomes of TLR-deficient cells are formally capable of supporting bacterial growth, but the combination of functional Nramp1 and lack of TLR signaling prevents S. typhimurium replication.Figure S3Other Intracellular Pathogens Can Replicate in TLR2×4×9-KO and MyD88×Trif-KO BMMs, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Listeria monocytogenes replicates in the absence of TLR signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2065710720,"Parkinson disease is caused by the death of midbrain dopamine neurons from oxidative stress, abnormal protein aggregation, and genetic predisposition. In 2003, Bonifati et al. (23) found that a single amino acid mutation in the DJ-1 protein was associated with early-onset, autosomal recessive Parkinson disease (PARK7). The mutation L166P prevents dimerization that is essential for the antioxidant and gene regulatory activity of the DJ-1 protein. Because low levels of DJ-1 cause Parkinson, we reasoned that overexpression might stop the disease. We found that overexpression of DJ-1 improved tolerance to oxidative stress by selectively up-regulating the rate-limiting step in glutathione synthesis. When we imposed a different metabolic insult, A53T mutant α-synuclein, we found that DJ-1 turned on production of the chaperone protein Hsp-70 without affecting glutathione synthesis. After screening a number of small molecules, we have found that the histone deacetylase inhibitor phenylbutyrate increases DJ-1 expression by 300% in the N27 dopamine cell line and rescues cells from oxidative stress and mutant α-synuclein toxicity. In mice, phenylbutyrate treatment leads to a 260% increase in brain DJ-1 levels and protects dopamine neurons against 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) toxicity. In a transgenic mouse model of diffuse Lewy body disease, long-term administration of phenylbutyrate reduces α-synuclein aggregation in brain and prevents age-related deterioration in motor and cognitive function. We conclude that drugs that up-regulate DJ-1 gene expression may slow the progression of Parkinson disease by moderating oxidative stress and protein aggregation."

Here, we identify and characterize CTRP13, a new and extremely conserved member of the C1q/TNF family. CTRP13 is preferentially expressed by adipose tissue and the brain in mice and predominantly by adipose tissue in humans. Within mouse adipose tissue, CTRP13 is largely expressed by cells of the stromal vascular compartment. Due to sexually dimorphic expression patterns, female mice have higher transcript and circulating CTRP13 levels than males. CTRP13 transcript and circulating levels are elevated in obese male mice, suggesting a potential role in energy metabolism. The insulin-sensitizing drug rosiglitazone also increases the expression of CTRP13 in adipocytes, which correlates with the insulin-sensitizing action of CTRP13. In a heterologous expression system, CTRP13 is secreted as a disulfide-linked oligomeric protein. When co-expressed, CTRP13 forms heteromeric complexes with a closely related family member, CTRP10. This heteromeric association does not involve conserved N-terminal Cys residues. Functional studies using purified recombinant protein demonstrated that CTRP13 is an adipokine that promotes glucose uptake in adipocytes, myotubes, and hepatocytes via activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. CTRP13 also ameliorates lipid-induced insulin resistance in hepatocytes through suppression of the SAPK/JNK stress signaling that impairs the insulin signaling pathway. Further, CTRP13 reduces glucose output in hepatocytes by inhibiting the mRNA expression of gluconeogenic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase and the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.

https://openalex.org/W2091113055,"The blue shark Prionace glauca is the most abundant large pelagic shark in the Atlantic Ocean. Although recaptures of tagged sharks have shown that the species is highly migratory, migration pathways towards the overwintering grounds remain poorly understood. We used archival satellite pop-up tags to track 23 blue sharks over a mean period of 88 days as they departed the coastal waters of North America in the autumn. Within 1–2 days of entering the Gulf Stream (median date of 21 Oct), all sharks initiated a striking diel vertical migration, taking them from a mean nighttime depth of 74 m to a mean depth of 412 m during the day as they appeared to pursue vertically migrating squid and fish prey. Although functionally blind at depth, calculations suggest that there would be a ∼2.5-fold thermoregulatory advantage to swimming and feeding in the markedly cooler deep waters, even if there was any reduced foraging success associated with the extreme depth. Noting that the Gulf Stream current speeds are reduced at depth, we used a detailed circulation model of the North Atlantic to examine the influence of the diving behaviour on the advection experienced by the sharks. However, there was no indication that the shark diving resulted in a significant modification of their net migratory pathway. The relative abundance of deep-diving sharks, swordfish, and sperm whales in the Gulf Stream and adjacent waters suggests that it may serve as a key winter feeding ground for large pelagic predators in the North Atlantic."
https://openalex.org/W2052748173,"On May 12, 2008, a destructive earthquake registering 8.0 on the Richter scale struck Sichuan Province, southwest China. Beichuan County was the epicenter which was one of the areas nearly completely destroyed by the earthquake. In Beichuan, about 15000 people died and 3000 people were missing. Specially, the earthquake took 1587 students' and 214 teachers' lives from the elementary and middle schools there. The main purpose of the study was to provide a better understanding of mental health problems and associated risk factors among children after earthquake.Three hundred and thirty grades 3-5 children completed the questionnaire of disaster -related experience and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children-Alternate Version (TSCC-A). The first survey was carried out six months after the earthquake, and the second one was carried out six months later. The measurements and methodology applied in the two sessions were identical.The prevalence rates of the problems at two time-points were 23.3% and 22.7% for anxiety, 14.5% and 16.1% for depression, and 11.2% and 13.4% for PTSD, respectively. Among demographic variables, no significant age difference existed, while it was found that 6 months after the earthquake, symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD were significantly more common among students in grades 4 and 5 than those in grade 3, Initial exposure to death, bereavement and extreme fear were significant predictive factors for the occurrence of anxiety, depression and PTSD.Findings of this study suggest that posttraumatic mental health problems after natural disaster in children may have reached epidemic proportions and remain high for a long period. Psychologist and social workers should pay more attention to children who experienced more traumatic stresses and provide appropriate mental health interventions. Implications and limitations of these findings were discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2019875433,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-protein-coding RNA molecules that modulate gene translation. Their expression is altered in many central nervous system (CNS) injuries suggesting a role in the cellular response to stress. Current studies in brain tissue have not yet described the cell-specific temporal miRNA expression patterns following ischemic injury. In this study, we analyzed the expression alterations of a set of miRNAs in neurons and astrocytes subjected to 60 minutes of ischemia and collected at different time-points following this injury. To mimic ischemic conditions and reperfusion in vitro, cortical primary neuronal and astrocytic cultures prepared from fetal rats were first placed in oxygen and glucose deprived (OGD) medium for 60 minutes, followed by their transfer into normoxic pre-conditioned medium. Total RNA was extracted at different time-points after the termination of the ischemic insult and the expression levels of miRNAs were measured. In neurons exposed to OGD, expression of miR-29b was upregulated 2-fold within 6 h and up to 4-fold at 24 h post-OGD, whereas induction of miR-21 was upregulated 2-fold after 24 h when compared to expression in neurons under normoxic conditions. In contrast, in astrocytes, miR-29b and miR-21 were upregulated only after 12 h. MiR-30b, 107, and 137 showed expression alteration in astrocytes, but not in neurons. Furthermore, we show that expression of miR-29b was significantly decreased in neurons exposed to Insulin-Like Growth Factor I (IGF-I), a well documented neuroprotectant in ischemic models. Our study indicates that miRNAs expression is altered in neurons and astrocytes after ischemic injury. Furthermore, we found that following OGD, specific miRNAs have unique cell-specific temporal expression patterns in CNS. Therefore the specific role of each miRNA in different intracellular processes in ischemic brain and the relevance of their temporal and spatial expression patterns warrant further investigation that may lead to novel strategies for therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2070475684,"When avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are transmitted from their reservoir hosts (wild waterfowl and shorebirds) to domestic bird species, they undergo genetic changes that have been linked to higher virulence and broader host range. Common genetic AIV modifications in viral proteins of poultry isolates are deletions in the stalk region of the neuraminidase (NA) and additions of glycosylation sites on the hemagglutinin (HA). Even though these NA deletion mutations occur in several AIV subtypes, they have not been analyzed comprehensively. In this study, 4,920 NA nucleotide sequences, 5,596 HA nucleotide and 4,702 HA amino acid sequences were analyzed to elucidate the widespread emergence of NA stalk deletions in gallinaceous hosts, the genetic polymorphism of the deletion patterns and association between the stalk deletions in NA and amino acid variants in HA. Forty-seven different NA stalk deletion patterns were identified in six NA subtypes, N1-N3 and N5-N7. An analysis that controlled for phylogenetic dependence due to shared ancestry showed that NA stalk deletions are statistically correlated with gallinaceous hosts and certain amino acid features on the HA protein. Those HA features included five glycosylation sites, one insertion and one deletion. The correlations between NA stalk deletions and HA features are HA-NA-subtype-specific. Our results demonstrate that stalk deletions in the NA proteins of AIV are relatively common. Understanding the NA stalk deletion and related HA features may be important for vaccine and drug development and could be useful in establishing effective early detection and warning systems for the poultry industry."

The cell must remodel this rigid structure during vegetative growth and during pheromone-induced morphogenesis. Wall remodeling is monitored and regulated by the cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling pathway, which activates a MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade (reviewed in Levin, 2005Levin D.E.

Swi6 allows Swi4 to bind DNA at cell cycle-regulated promoters by relieving an autoinhibitory intramolecular association of the Swi4 C terminus with its DNA-binding domain.

Mpk1 and its pseudokinase paralog, Mlp1, which is also activated by the MEKs of the CWI signaling pathway, use a noncatalytic mechanism to activate SBF. Activated (phosphorylated) Mpk1, or Mlp1, forms a complex with Swi4 that associates with SBF-binding sites in the promoters of cell wall stress target genes independent of Swi6 (Kim et al., 2008Kim K.-Y. Truman A.W. Levin D.E. Yeast Mpk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase activates transcription through Swi4/Swi6 by a noncatalytic mechanism that requires upstream signal.Mol. Cell.

Transcriptional reporters for genes activated by cell wall stress through a non-catalytic mechanism involving Mpk1 and SBF.Yeast. 2010; 27: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this context, Mpk1 (or Mlp1) relieves the autoinhibitory Swi4 interaction by binding to a MAPK docking site on Swi4 (a D motif) adjacent to the C-terminal Swi6-binding site (Truman et al., 2009Truman A.W. Kim K.Y. Levin D.E. Mechanism of Mpk1 MAPK binding to the Swi4 transcription factor and its regulation by a novel caffeine-induced phosphorylation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 6449-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although Swi6 is not required for Swi4 to bind to the promoters of cell wall stress genes, it must be recruited to the Mpk1-Swi4 complex to activate transcription. Here, we show that Mpk1 also serves a noncatalytic function in transcription elongation through an association with the RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-associated complex (Paf1C). This complex, originally identified in yeast, is comprised of five subunits (Paf1, Cdc73, Rtf1, Ctr9, and Leo1; Mueller et al., 2004Mueller C.L. Porter S.E. Hoffman M.G. Jaehning J.A.

The importance of this complex is underscored by the identification of various subunits of the human Paf1C as candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (Chaudhary et al., 2007Chaudhary K. Deb S.

Despite this, little is known about the regulation of the Paf1C or of mechanisms governing gene expression through this complex. The Paf1C associates with the open reading frames of all Pol II-transcribed genes examined, consistent with its binding to Pol II (Pokholok et al., 2002Pokholok D.K. Hannett N.M. Young R.A.

However, global gene expression analyses suggested that the Paf1C is important for the expression of fewer than 5% of yeast genes (Penheiter et al., 2005Penheiter K.L. Washburn T.M. Porter S.E.

Consistent with the idea that the Paf1C is important for the expression of a subset of Pol II-transcribed genes, the yeast Paf1C components are not essential, but their loss results in hypersensitivity to a variety of stresses (Betz et al., 2002Betz J.L. Chang M. Washburn T.M. Porter S.E. Mueller C.L. Jaehning J.A.

Genomics. 2002; 268: 272-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), implicating this complex in the expression of stress-responsive genes. Among the conditions to which mutants in the Paf1C are hypersensitive is cell wall stress, prompting the suggestion that the CWI pathway plays a regulatory role in Paf1C-mediated transcription (Chang et al., 1999Chang M. French-Cornay D. Fan H.Y. Klein H. Denis C.L. Jaehning J.A. A complex containing RNA polymerase II, Paf1p, Cdc73p, Hpr1p, and Ccr4p plays a role in protein kinase C signaling.Mol. Cell.

We demonstrate that the Mpk1-Paf1C association allows transcription elongation of the FKS2 gene by preventing recruitment of and premature termination by the Sen1-Nrd1-Nab3 complex. This complex is known to function specifically in the termination of short, nonpolyadenylated Pol II transcripts, including small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), and at a few known mRNA attenuation sites (Ursic et al., 1997Ursic D.

Cell. 2006; 21: 641-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings reveal a MAPK-driven mechanism for suppressing transcriptional attenuation of a stress-induced gene. We showed previously by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis that activated Mpk1 MAPK binds to the FKS2 promoter independent of its protein kinase activity through association with the Swi4 transcription factor (Kim et al., 2008Kim K.-Y. Truman A.W. Levin D.E. Yeast Mpk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase activates transcription through Swi4/Swi6 by a noncatalytic mechanism that requires upstream signal.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 2579-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because other MAPKs, most notably Hog1, have been shown to associate not only with the promoters of target genes, but with the coding regions as well (Pokholok et al., 2006Pokholok D.K. Zeitlinger J. Hannett N.M. Reynolds D.B. Young R.A. Activated signal transduction kinases frequently occupy target genes.Science. 2006; 313: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, Proft et al., 2006Proft M. Mas G. de Nadal E. Vendrell A.

Cell. 2006; 23: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we extended our analysis of Mpk1 to ask whether this MAPK binds to the FKS2 coding region. We found that Mpk1 associates with genomic regions along the length of the FKS2 gene in response to activation by cell wall stress induced by elevated growth temperature (Figure 1A ). Moreover, the catalytically inactive Mpk1-K54R mutant form of Mpk1 behaved like wild-type in this assay. However, a mutant form of Mpk1 that cannot be phosphorylated by its upstream activating kinases (Mpk1-TAYF) failed to associate with any part of the FKS2 gene, revealing the requirement for activating signal. We demonstrated additionally that the pseudokinase paralog of Mpk1, Mlp1, also associates with the FKS2 promoter (Kim et al., 2008Kim K.-Y. Truman A.W. Levin D.E. Yeast Mpk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase activates transcription through Swi4/Swi6 by a noncatalytic mechanism that requires upstream signal.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 2579-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In fact, it was this finding that led us to the understanding that Mpk1-driven FKS2 transcription does not require its protein kinase activity. Like Mpk1, activated Mlp1 also bound to the FKS2 coding region (Figure 1B). In contrast to the presence of Mpk1 and Mlp1 across the FKS2 gene, we found that the Swi4 and Swi6 transcription factors were present only at the promoter (Figures 1C and 1D), consistent with their established role in transcription initiation. This suggested a model in which Mpk1 and Mlp1 move from the transcription initiation complex to the transcription elongation complex, leaving Swi4-Swi6 behind. Our starting assumption was that Mpk1 association with the elongation complex is integral to the mechanism by which this MAPK controls cell wall stress-induced transcription. Therefore, we wished to identify the factors required for Mpk1 to bind the FKS2 coding region. As a first step, we tested individual deletion mutants in nonessential genes that encode established or putative transcription elongation factors for their effects on FKS2-lacZ reporter expression. From among 71 deletion mutants, we identified 25 that displayed impaired induction of FKS2-lacZ in response to heat stress (Table S1 available online). Tests of two-hybrid interactions between Mpk1 and this subset of factors led us to focus on the Paf1C. All five components of this complex (Paf1, Cdc73, Rtf1, Ctr9, and Leo1; Mueller et al., 2004Mueller C.L. Porter S.E. Hoffman M.G. Jaehning J.A. The Paf1 complex has functions independent of actively transcribing RNA polymerase II.Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) interacted with Mpk1 in a cell wall stress-dependent manner (Figure S1). In addition to the Paf1C subunits, we also detected stress-induced association of Mpk1 with the Gcn5 and Ada2 subunits of the SAGA and ADA histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes (see below). Because we were specifically interested in the mechanism by which Mpk1 associates with the transcription elongation complex, we next examined by coimmunoprecipitation the requirements for association of Mpk1 with Paf1. A variety of cell wall stress treatments stimulated this association (Figure 2A ), indicating a requirement for activating signal to Mpk1. In support of this conclusion, we found that formation of the Mpk1-Paf1 complex was blocked in a nonphosphorylatable form of Mpk1 (Mpk1-TAYF; Figure 2B). However, Mpk1 catalytic activity was dispensable for Paf1 binding, as judged by the behavior of the catalytically inactive Mpk1-K54R protein. In addition to an activating signal, formation of the Mpk1-Paf1 complex required the presence of Swi4 (Figure 2C). Thus, the association occurs under conditions in which activated Mpk1 forms a complex with Swi4 on the promoters of target genes. We interpret this to mean that the Mpk1-Paf1 interaction is restricted to genes regulated by Mpk1-Swi4. However, Mpk1-Swi4 promoter binding was not sufficient to allow the Mpk1-Paf1 interaction, which also required the presence of Swi6 (Figure 2C). Although Swi6 is not needed for Mpk1-Swi4 promoter occupancy, it is required for transcriptional activation of FKS2 (Kim et al., 2008Kim K.-Y. Truman A.W. Levin D.E. Yeast Mpk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase activates transcription through Swi4/Swi6 by a noncatalytic mechanism that requires upstream signal.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 2579-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Mpk1-Paf1 association is dependent on the same factors required for FKS2 transcription initiation in response to cell wall stress. Consistent with this, the Mpk1-Paf1 interaction was independent of the Rlm1 transcription factor (Figure 2C), which controls cell wall stress transcription of other genes in response to Mpk1 activation (Jung and Levin, 1999Jung U.S. Levin D.E. Genome-wide analysis of gene expression regulated by the yeast cell wall integrity signalling pathway.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). We noted additionally that, in the absence of Swi6, neither Paf1 nor the Rpb3 Pol II subunit were recruited stably to the FKS2 gene (Figure 2D), even though the Mpk1-Swi4 complex resides at the promoter under these conditions (Kim et al., 2008Kim K.-Y. Truman A.W. Levin D.E. Yeast Mpk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase activates transcription through Swi4/Swi6 by a noncatalytic mechanism that requires upstream signal.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 2579-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the Pol II-Paf1C complex must also be recruited to Mpk1-Swi4-Swi6-regulated promoters for the MAPK to bind the Paf1C. In contrast to the above results, the cell wall stress-induced association of Mpk1 with either Gcn5 or Ada2 was only modestly reduced in a swi6Δ mutant (Figure S2), indicating that these interactions occur largely independent of Mpk1-Swi4-Swi6-driven transcription. However, both interactions were greatly reduced in an rlm1Δ mutant, suggesting a more general role for HAT complexes in cell wall stress transcription. For this reason and because the Paf1C had been implicated previously in the maintenance of cell wall integrity (Chang et al., 1999Chang M. French-Cornay D. Fan H.Y. Klein H. Denis C.L. Jaehning J.A. A complex containing RNA polymerase II, Paf1p, Cdc73p, Hpr1p, and Ccr4p plays a role in protein kinase C signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1056-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we focused our attention on this complex. Both Mpk1 and Paf1 are part of larger complexes on the DNA, so their interactions might be indirect. However, we speculated that Mpk1 associates directly with Paf1 for two reasons. First, Swi4 and Swi6 do not associate with the FKS2 coding region, indicating that Mpk1 does not interact with the Paf1C indirectly through either of these factors. Second, among the two-hybrid associations detected between Mpk1 and various Paf1C subunits, the strongest was with Paf1 itself, which appears to be the major scaffolding subunit of the complex (Jaehning, 2010Jaehning J.A. The Paf1 complex: platform or player in RNA polymerase II transcription?.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1799: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, Kim et al., 2010bKim J. Guermah M. Roeder R.G. The human PAF1 complex acts in chromatin transcription elongation both independently and cooperatively with SII/TFIIS.Cell. 2010; 140: 491-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first tested a set of N-terminal and C-terminal truncations of Paf1 for two-hybrid association with Mpk1. This analysis narrowed the region that is important for interaction to residues 86–131 (Figure 3A ). MAPKs associate with their substrates and regulators through a canonical D motif, (Arg/Lys)1-2-(X)2-6-ΦA-x-ΦB (wherein Φ are hydrophobic residues Leu, Ile, or Val), recognized by a common docking site in the MAPK (Zhang et al., 2003Zhang J. Zhou B. Zheng C.-F. Zhang Z.-Y. A bipartite mechanism for ERK2 recognition by its cognate regulators and substrates.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29901-29912Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because the Mpk1-Paf1 association did not require its catalytic activity, we reasoned that it might involve the Mpk1 docking site in the same manner that this MAPK associates with Swi4 (Truman et al., 2009Truman A.W. Kim K.Y. Levin D.E. Mechanism of Mpk1 MAPK binding to the Swi4 transcription factor and its regulation by a novel caffeine-induced phosphorylation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 6449-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility, we next identified a single potential D motif in Paf1 within the stretch of sequence identified by the two-hybrid analysis (93-KDDRILLR-100) and constructed a mutant in which this site is ablated (residues 97–100 mutated to Ala; Paf1-4A). Consistent with the notion that this is a functional D motif, we found that the Paf1-4A protein failed to coimmunoprecipitate with Mpk1 in response to cell wall stress (Figure 3B). To determine whether the observed associations between Mpk1 and the other Paf1C subunits were indirect through Paf1, we tested by coimmunoprecipitation the effect of the paf1-4A mutation on pairwise associations of Mpk1 with Paf1C subunits. Although Mpk1 associated in vivo with each of the Paf1C subunits, all of those associations were lost in the paf1-4A mutant (Figure 3C), suggesting that Mpk1 engages in a stable interaction with the Paf1C at a single point, which is ablated in the paf1-4A mutant. The Paf1-4A protein is generally functional, as judged by several criteria. First, the mutant subunit was detected in complex with each of the other Paf1C subunits and with the Rpb3 subunit of Pol II in vivo (Figure S3), indicating that the structural integrity of the Paf1C as well as its interaction with Pol II, which recruits Paf1C to the promoter (Jaehning, 2010Jaehning J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2123993442,"The enzymatic degradation of plant cell walls plays a central role in the carbon cycle and is of increasing environmental and industrial significance. The enzymes that catalyze this process include xylanases that degrade xylan, a β-1,4-xylose polymer that is decorated with various sugars. Although xylanases efficiently hydrolyze unsubstituted xylans, these enzymes are unable to access highly decorated forms of the polysaccharide, such as arabinoxylans that contain arabinofuranose decorations. Here, we show that a Clostridium thermocellum enzyme, designated CtXyl5A, hydrolyzes arabinoxylans but does not attack unsubstituted xylans. Analysis of the reaction products generated by CtXyl5A showed that all the oligosaccharides contain an O3 arabinose linked to the reducing end xylose. The crystal structure of the catalytic module (CtGH5) of CtXyl5A, appended to a family 6 noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding module (CtCBM6), showed that CtGH5 displays a canonical (α/β)(8)-barrel fold with the substrate binding cleft running along the surface of the protein. The catalytic apparatus is housed in the center of the cleft. Adjacent to the -1 subsite is a pocket that could accommodate an l-arabinofuranose-linked α-1,3 to the active site xylose, which is likely to function as a key specificity determinant. CtCBM6, which adopts a β-sandwich fold, recognizes the termini of xylo- and gluco-configured oligosaccharides, consistent with the pocket topology displayed by the ligand-binding site. In contrast to typical modular glycoside hydrolases, there is an extensive hydrophobic interface between CtGH5 and CtCBM6, and thus the two modules cannot function as independent entities."
https://openalex.org/W2098838776,"Gender differences in vulnerability for cocaine addiction have been reported. Though the mechanisms are not understood, here we hypothesize that gender differences in reactivity to conditioned-cues, which contributes to relapse, are involved.To test this we compared brain metabolism (using PET and ¹⁸FDG) between female (n = 10) and male (n = 16) active cocaine abusers when they watched a neutral video (nature scenes) versus a cocaine-cues video.Self-reports of craving increased with the cocaine-cue video but responses did not differ between genders. In contrast, changes in whole brain metabolism with cocaine-cues differed by gender (p<0.05); females significantly decreased metabolism (-8.6%±10) whereas males tended to increase it (+5.5%±18). SPM analysis (Cocaine-cues vs Neutral) in females revealed decreases in frontal, cingulate and parietal cortices, thalamus and midbrain (p<0.001) whereas males showed increases in right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44/45) (only at p<0.005). The gender-cue interaction showed greater decrements with Cocaine-cues in females than males (p<0.001) in frontal (BA 8, 9, 10), anterior cingulate (BA 24, 32), posterior cingulate (BA 23, 31), inferior parietal (BA 40) and thalamus (dorsomedial nucleus).Females showed greater brain reactivity to cocaine-cues than males but no differences in craving, suggesting that there may be gender differences in response to cues that are not linked with craving but could affect subsequent drug use. Specifically deactivation of brain regions from ""control networks"" (prefrontal, cingulate, inferior parietal, thalamus) in females could increase their vulnerability to relapse since it would interfere with executive function (cognitive inhibition). This highlights the importance of gender tailored interventions for cocaine addiction."

Msi1 binds to the 3′-UTR of its target mRNAs in NS/PCs, prevents their translation, and interferes with NS/PC differentiation. We previously showed that Msi1 competes with eIF4G to bind poly(A)-binding protein and inhibits assembly of the 80 S ribosome. Here we show that Msi1 works in concert with Lin28 to regulate post-transcriptional microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis in the cropping step, which occurs in the nucleus. Lin28 and its binding partner terminal uridylyltransferase 4 (TUT4) are known to maintain embryonic stem cell pluripotency by blocking let-7 miRNA biogenesis at the dicing step. Interestingly, we found that during early neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells, Msi1 enhanced the localization of Lin28 to the nucleus and also inhibited the nuclear cropping step of another let-7 family miRNA, miR98.

Interestingly, we found that during early neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells, Msi1 enhanced the localization of Lin28 to the nucleus and also inhibited the nuclear cropping step of another let-7 family miRNA, miR98. These results suggest that Msi1 can influence stem cell maintenance and differentiation by controlling the subcellular localization of proteins involved in miRNA biogenesis, as well as by regulating the translation of its target mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2067987032,"Background Sirt6 has been implicated in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism and the development of hepatic steatosis. The aim of this study was to address the potential role of Sirt6 in the protective effects of rosiglitazone (RGZ) on hepatic steatosis. Methods To investigate the effect of RGZ on hepatic steatosis, rats were treated with RGZ (4 mg·kg−1·day−1) by stomach gavage for 6 weeks. The involvement of Sirt6 in the RGZ's regulation was evaluated by Sirt6 knockdown in AML12 mouse hepatocytes. Results RGZ treatment ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation and increased expression of Sirt6, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivtor-1-α (Ppargc1a/PGC1-α) and Forkhead box O1 (Foxo1) in rat livers. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation was also increased by RGZ, accompanied by alterations in phosphorylation of LKB1. Interestingly, in free fatty acid-treated cells, Sirt6 knockdown increased hepatocyte lipid accumulation measured as increased triglyceride contents (p = 0.035), suggesting that Sirt6 may be beneficial in reducing hepatic fat accumulation. In addition, Sirt6 knockdown abolished the effects of RGZ on hepatocyte fat accumulation, mRNA and protein expression of Ppargc1a/PGC1-α and Foxo1, and phosphorylation levels of LKB1 and AMPK, suggesting that Sirt6 is involved in RGZ-mediated metabolic effects. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that RGZ significantly decreased hepatic lipid accumulation, and that this process appeared to be mediated by the activation of the Sirt6-AMPK pathway. We propose Sirt6 as a possible therapeutic target for hepatic steatosis."
https://openalex.org/W2088499893,"Tumor progression requires a crosstalk with the tumor surrounding, where the tumor matrix plays an essential role. We recently reported that only the matrix delivered by a CD44v6-competent (ASMLwt), but not that of a CD44v6-deficient (ASML-CD44vkd) rat pancreatic adenocarcinoma line supports metastasis formation. We here describe that this matrix provides an important feedback toward the tumor cell and that CD44v6 accounts for orchestrating signals received from the matrix. ASMLwt cells contain more hyaluronan synthase-3 and secrete higher amounts of >50 kDa HA than ASML-CD44vkd cells, which secrete more hyaluronidase. Only the ASMLwt-matrix supports migration and apoptosis resistance, which both can be initiated via CD44v6, c-Met, and α6β4 ligand binding and proceed via FAK, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK activation, respectively. However, c-Met- and α6β4-initiated signaling are strongly augmented by the association with CD44v6 as only very weak effects are observed in CD44v6-deficient cells. The same CD44v6-dependent convergence of motility- and apoptosis resistance-related signals also accounts for human tumor lines. Thus, CD44v6 promotes motility and apoptosis resistance via its involvement in assembling a matrix that, in turn, triggers activation of signaling cascades, which proceeds, independent of the initiating receptor-ligand interaction, in a concerted action via CD44v6.

https://openalex.org/W1970967215,"Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a key transcription factor required for cellular adaptation to hypoxia, although its physiological roles and activation mechanisms during normoxia have not been studied sufficiently. The Warburg effect, which is a hallmark of malignant tumors that is characterized by increased activity of aerobic glycolysis, accompanies activation of HIF-1 during normoxia. Besides tumor cells that have multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, normal macrophages also use glycolysis for ATP production by depending upon elevated HIF-1 activity even during normoxia. We recently found that activity of factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) is specifically suppressed in macrophages by a nonproteolytic activity of membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP/MMP-14). Thus, MT1-MMP expressed in macrophages plays a significant role in regulating HIF-1 activity during normoxia. In the light of this finding, we examined here whether MT1-MMP contributes to the Warburg effect of tumor cells. All the tumor cell lines that express MT1-MMP exhibit increased glycolytic activity, and forced expression of MT1-MMP in MT1-MMP-negative tumor cells is sufficient to induce the Warburg effect. The cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP mediates the stimulation of aerobic glycolysis by increasing the expression of HIF-1 target genes. Specific intervention of the MT1-MMP-mediated activation of HIF-1 in tumor cells retarded tumor growth in mice. Systemic administration of a membrane-penetrating form of the cytoplasmic tail peptide in mice to inhibit HIF-1 activation competitively also exhibited a therapeutic effect on tumors."

Initial investigations identified an epidemiologic association between illness and consumption of raw tomatoes, yet cases continued. In mid-June, we investigated two clusters of outbreak strain infections in Texas among patrons of Restaurant A and two establishments of Restaurant Chain B to determine the outbreak's source.We conducted independent case-control studies of Restaurant A and B patrons. Patients were matched to well controls by meal date. We conducted restaurant environmental investigations and traced the origin of implicated products. Forty-seven case-patients and 40 controls were enrolled in the Restaurant A study. Thirty case-patients and 31 controls were enrolled in the Restaurant Chain B study. In both studies, illness was independently associated with only one menu item, fresh salsa (Restaurant A: matched odds ratio [mOR], 37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.2-386; Restaurant B: mOR, 13; 95% CI 1.3-infinity). The only ingredient in common between the two salsas was raw jalapeño peppers. Cultures of jalapeño peppers collected from an importer that supplied Restaurant Chain B and serrano peppers and irrigation water from a Mexican farm that supplied that importer with jalapeño and serrano peppers grew the outbreak strain.Jalapeño peppers, contaminated before arrival at the restaurants and served in uncooked fresh salsas, were the source of these infections. Our investigations, critical in understanding the broader multistate outbreak, exemplify an effective approach to investigating large foodborne outbreaks. Additional measures are needed to reduce produce contamination."
https://openalex.org/W2014007356,"Commonly used antitumor treatments, including radiation and chemotherapy, function by damaging the DNA of rapidly proliferating cells. However, resistance to these agents is a predominant clinical problem. A member of the Rho family of small GTPases, RhoB has been shown to be integral in mediating cell death after ionizing radiation (IR) or other DNA damaging agents in Ras-transformed cell lines. In addition, RhoB protein expression increases after genotoxic stress, and loss of RhoB expression causes radio- and chemotherapeutic resistance. However, the signaling pathways that govern RhoB-induced cell death after DNA damage remain enigmatic. Here, we show that RhoB activity increases in human breast and cervical cancer cell lines after treatment with DNA damaging agents. Furthermore, RhoB activity is necessary for DNA damage-induced cell death, as the stable loss of RhoB protein expression using shRNA partially protects cells and prevents the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and the induction of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim after IR. The increase in RhoB activity after genotoxic stress is associated with increased activity of the nuclear guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), Ect2 and Net1, but not the cytoplasmic GEFs p115 RhoGEF or Vav2. Importantly, loss of Ect2 and Net1 via siRNA-mediated protein knock-down inhibited IR-induced increases in RhoB activity, reduced apoptotic signaling events, and protected cells from IR-induced cell death. Collectively, these data suggest a mechanism involving the nuclear GEFs Ect2 and Net1 for activating RhoB after genotoxic stress, thereby facilitating cell death after treatment with DNA damaging agents."
https://openalex.org/W2000887190,"Estimating the age-specific incidence of an emerging pathogen is essential for understanding its severity and transmission dynamics. This paper describes a statistical method that uses likelihoods to estimate incidence from sequential serological data. The method requires information on seroconversion intervals and allows integration of information on the temporal distribution of cases from clinical surveillance. Among a family of candidate incidences, a likelihood function is derived by reconstructing the change in seroprevalence from seroconversion following infection and comparing it with the observed sequence of positivity among the samples. This method is applied to derive the cumulative and weekly incidence of A/H1N1 pandemic influenza in England during the second wave using sera taken between September 2009 and February 2010 in four age groups (1–4, 5–14, 15–24, 25–44 years). The highest cumulative incidence was in 5–14 year olds (59%, 95% credible interval (CI): 52%, 68%) followed by 1–4 year olds (49%, 95% CI: 38%, 61%), rates 20 and 40 times higher respectively than estimated from clinical surveillance. The method provides a more accurate and continuous measure of incidence than achieved by comparing prevalence in samples grouped by time period."
https://openalex.org/W2087188235,"Development of treatments for acute and chronic pain conditions remains a challenge, with an unmet need for improved sensitivity and reproducibility in measuring pain in patients. Here we used pulsed-continuous arterial spin-labelling [pCASL], a relatively novel perfusion magnetic-resonance imaging technique, in conjunction with a commonly-used post-surgical model, to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow [rCBF] associated with the experience of being in ongoing pain. We demonstrate repeatable, reproducible assessment of ongoing pain that is independent of patient self-report. In a cross-over trial design, 16 participants requiring bilateral removal of lower-jaw third molars underwent pain-free pre-surgical pCASL scans. Following extraction of either left or right tooth, repeat scans were acquired during post-operative ongoing pain. When pain-free following surgical recovery, the pre/post-surgical scanning procedure was repeated for the remaining tooth. Voxelwise statistical comparison of pre and post-surgical scans was performed to reveal rCBF changes representing ongoing pain. In addition, rCBF values in predefined pain and control brain regions were obtained. rCBF increases (5-10%) representing post-surgical ongoing pain were identified bilaterally in a network including primary and secondary somatosensory, insula and cingulate cortices, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, midbrain and brainstem (including trigeminal ganglion and principal-sensory nucleus), but not in a control region in visual cortex. rCBF changes were reproducible, with no rCBF differences identified across scans within-session or between post-surgical pain sessions. This is the first report of the cerebral representation of ongoing post-surgical pain without the need for exogenous tracers. Regions of rCBF increases are plausibly associated with pain and the technique is reproducible, providing an attractive proposition for testing interventions for on-going pain that do not rely solely on patient self-report. Our findings have the potential to improve our understanding of the cerebral representation of persistent painful conditions, leading to improved identification of specific patient sub-types and implementation of mechanism-based treatments."
https://openalex.org/W1985668304,"Background Latino children are at increased risk for mirconutrient deficiencies and problems of overweight and obesity. Exposures in pregnancy and early postpartum may impact future growth trajectories. Objectives To evaluate the relationship between prenatal and postnatal maternal depressive symptoms experienced in pregnancy and infant growth from birth to 2 years of age in a cohort of Latino infants. Methods We recruited pregnant Latina mothers at two San Francisco hospitals and followed their healthy infants to 24 months of age. At 6, 12 and 24 months of age, infants were weighed and measured. Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed prenatally and at 4-6 weeks postpartum. Women who had high depressive symptoms at both time periods were defined as having chronic depression. Logistic mixed models were applied to compare growth curves and risk for overweight and underweight based on exposure to maternal depression. Results We followed 181 infants to 24 months. At 12 and 24 months, respectively, 27.4% and 40.5% were overweight, and 5.6% and 2.2% were underweight. Exposure to chronic maternal depression was associated with underweight (OR = 12.12, 95%CI 1.86-78.78) and with reduced weight gain in the first 2 years of life (Coef = -0.48, 95% CI -0.94—0.01) compared with unexposed infants or infants exposed to episodic depression (depression at one time point). Exposure to chronic depression was also associated with reduced risk for overweight in the first 2 years of life (OR 0.28, 95%CI 0.03-0.92). Conclusions Exposure to chronic maternal depression in the pre- and postnatal period was associated with reduced weight gain in the first two years of life and greater risk for failure to thrive, in comparison with unexposed infants or those exposed episodically. The infants of mothers with chronic depression may need additional nutritional monitoring and intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1980591059,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2) is a member of a family of six highly conserved IGFBPs that are carriers for the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). IGFBP-2 levels rise during rapid neonatal growth and at the time of peak bone acquisition. In contrast, Igfbp2−/− mice have low bone mass accompanied by reduced osteoblast numbers, low bone formation rates, and increased PTEN expression. In the current study, we postulated that IGFBP-2 increased bone mass partly through the activity of its heparin-binding domain (HBD). We synthesized a HBD peptide specific for IGFBP-2 and demonstrated in vitro that it rescued the mineralization phenotype of Igfbp2−/− bone marrow stromal cells and calvarial osteoblasts. Consistent with its cellular actions, the HBD peptide ex vivo stimulated metacarpal periosteal expansion. Furthermore, administration of HBD peptide to Igfbp2−/− mice increased osteoblast number, suppressed marrow adipogenesis, restored trabecular bone mass, and reduced bone resorption. Skeletal rescue in the Igfbp2−/− mice was characterized by reduced PTEN expression followed by enhanced Akt phosphorylation in response to IGF-I and increased β-catenin signaling through two mechanisms: 1) stimulation of its cytosolic accumulation and 2) increased phosphorylation of serine 552. We conclude that the HBD peptide of IGFBP-2 has anabolic activity by activating IGF-I/Akt and β-catenin signaling pathways.

IGFBP-2 has high affinity for IGF-I/IGF-II and is believed to regulate IGF bioavailability in the pericellular environment. IGFBP-2 is the second most abundant circulating IGFBPs and is expressed in several mammalian tissues including the skeleton (2Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growing evidence demonstrates that increased IGFBP-2 levels are associated with reduced adipose tissue mass and improved glucose metabolism both in human and mouse models (4Hu D. Pawlikowska L.

However, the role of IGFBP-2 in skeletal homeostasis is less clear and is dependent on the experimental model system. Generally, IGFBP-2 has been shown to inhibit IGF-I actions in vitro (3Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Also, overexpression of Igfbp2 inhibits growth hormone-stimulated chondrocytic expansion in growth hormone transgenic mice (7Hoeflich A. Nedbal S. Blum W.F. Erhard M. Lahm H. Brem G. Kolb H.J. Wanke R. Wolf E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1889-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, Khosla and co-workers (8Conover C.A. Johnstone E.W. Turner R.T. Evans G.L. John Ballard F.J.

Furthermore, we recently showed that Igfbp2−/− mice had markedly impaired bone formation, reduced trabecular bone volume fraction, and altered microarchitecture and low bone turnover, suggesting that IGFBP-2 might be extremely important within the skeletal milieu (10DeMambro V.E.

In addition to its IGF-I binding dependent actions, IGFBP-2 and other IGFBPs have been shown to stimulate biologic responses that are independent of their abilities to bind to IGFs (3Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Similarly Lodish and co-workers (11Zhang C.C. Kaba M. Iizuka S. Huynh H. Lodish H.F. Blood. 2008; 111: 3415-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that IGFBP-2 alone could stimulate hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo, although the mechanism of its action was not described. Previously, IGFBP-2 was reported to bind to extracellular matrices (12Arai T. Busby Jr., W. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4571-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Russo V.C. Bach L.A. Fosang A.J. Baker N.L. Werther G.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4858-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). More recently several lines of evidence show that the heparin-binding domain (HBD) plays a role in IGFBP-2 function. Russo et al. (14Russo V.C. Rekaris G. Baker N.L. Bach L.A. Werther G.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3082-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that IGFBP-2 was proteolytically cleaved and that smaller fragments that include HBD still possessed the capacity to bind to extracellular matrix and with low affinity to IGF-I. They also demonstrated that IGFBP-2 stimulated the proliferation and metastatic behavior of neuroblastoma cells through the HBD (15Russo V.C. Schütt B.S. Andaloro E. Ymer S.I. Hoeflich A. Ranke M.B. Bach L.A. Werther G.A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 4445-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Interestingly, zebrafish IGFBP-2 lacks the HBD and cannot bind to any extracellular matrix (16Duan C. Ding J. Li Q. Tsai W. Pozios K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 15274-15279Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that IGFBP-2 binding to extracellular matrix is likely to be dependent on the HBD. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is a lipid phosphatase that opposes IGF-I signaling by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (17Kawai M. Rosen C.J. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2009; 24: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mice lacking PTEN only in osteoblasts showed progressively increasing bone mass with age, indicating the important role of PTEN and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in bone maintenance (18Liu X. Bruxvoort K.J. Zylstra C.R. Liu J. Cichowski R. Faugere M.C. Bouxsein M.L. Wan C. Williams B.O. Clemens T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). There is also a negative correlation between IGFBP-2 and PTEN expression in certain types of tumor cells (19Mehrian-Shai R. Chen C.D. Shi T. Horvath S. Nelson S.F. Reichardt J.K. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5563-5568Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 20Perks C.M. Vernon E.G.

Commun. 2005; 336: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, we reported that PTEN expression was enhanced in osteoblasts derived from Igfbp2−/− bone marrow stromal cells (10DeMambro V.E. Clemmons D.R. Horton L.G. Bouxsein M.L. Wood T.L. Beamer W.G. Canalis E. Rosen C.J. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 2051-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Perks et al. (20Perks C.M. Vernon E.G. Rosendahl A.H. Tonge D. Holly J.M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5966-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) suggested that IGFBP-2 suppression of PTEN was mediated in an IGF binding-independent manner. Because Akt activation is a critical factor regulating bone mass (22Sakata T. Wang Y. Halloran B.P. Elalieh H.Z. Cao J. Bikle D.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 436-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Shoba L.N. Lee J.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we speculated that IGFBP-2 could enhance Akt signaling by suppressing PTEN expression independent of IGF-I binding and that the HBD is involved in the down-regulation of PTEN. IGFBP-2 contains two putative HBDs: one HBD in the C terminus domain shares the sequence similarity with other HBD containing IGFBPs such as IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 (3Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the HBD in the linker region is unique and is not present in other IGFBPs. Based on the unique sequence of the IGFBP-2 HBD subsequently referred to simply as the HBD, we generated a peptide corresponding to the one in the linker region and tested whether the HBD peptide affected skeletal turnover. We found that the HBD peptide has an anabolic effect on the skeleton through suppression of PTEN in osteoblasts and that this effect was mediated by enhanced Akt and β-catenin signaling. Moreover, there was significant synergy between the HBD and IGF-I in respect to enhancement of pAKT and β-catenin production. Generation of the original mixed background strain B6;129-Igfbp2<tm1Jep>, which we refer to as Igfbp2−/− mice, has been described previously (10DeMambro V.E. Clemmons D.R. Horton L.G. Bouxsein M.L.

All of the experimental studies were performed with male mice. All of the animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Maine Medical Center Research Institute. MC3T3-E1 cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in αMEM containing 10% FCS neonatal calvarial osteoblasts were collected from 7–10-day-old mice. Briefly, calvariae were digested five times with collagenase P and trypsin. The cells released from digests 2–5 were collected as primary calvarial osteoblasts and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and nonessential amino acids. Osteoblastogenesis of primary calvarial osteoblasts was analyzed by treating cells with 4 mm of β-glycerophosphate and 50 μg/ml of ascorbic acid in αMEM with 10% FCS. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were harvested from femurs and tibias of 8-week-old mice. BMSCs were grown in αMEM containing 10% FCS. Osteoblastogenesis of BMSCs was induced by the treatment with osteogenic medium consisting of αMEM containing 10% FCS, 8 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid. Metacarpals were isolated from Igfbp2−/− mice from 1-day-old mice and incubated in DMEM containing 0.5% BSA, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate for 10 days. Stimulants were added to culture medium from day 1. At day 10, metacarpals were incubated in medium containing calcein (500 ng/ml) for 2 h for staining of calcium deposition, and images were obtained. The bones were then fixed with 4% phosphonoformic acid, embedded in paraffin, and processed for Alcian blue and von Kossa double staining. Total RNA was prepared using a RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated using a random hexamer and reverse transcriptase (Superscript III; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantification of mRNA expression was carried out using an iQ SYBR Green Supermix in a iQ5 thermal cycler and detection system (Bio-Rad). GAPDH was used as an internal standard control gene for all quantification. The primer sequences are available upon request. To prepare whole cell lysates, the cells were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). To isolate the cytosolic fraction, the cells were solubilized with hypotonic buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm Tris, 0.2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and kept on ice for 10 min. The cell lysates were mixed with sucrose buffer (final concentrations: 25 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant contained the cytosolic fraction. To prepare the membrane fraction, the cells were solubilized with PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were frozen at −80 °C for 1 h and thawed at room temperature. After three cycles, they were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 25 min. The pellet was resuspended with membrane protein isolation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Equal amounts of sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline. Thereafter, the membranes were immunoblotted with anti-PTEN (Cell Signaling), anti-Akt (Cell Signaling), anti-Ser(P)473-Akt (Cell Signaling), anti-β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories, 610153), anti-Ser(P)552-β-catenin (Cell Signaling), or anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz) and developed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse or rabbit IgG antibodies, followed by enhancement with SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate antibodies (Pierce). The cells were starved with serum-free medium overnight and then exposed to 0 or 50 ng/ml IGF-I for 10 min. The cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. They were immunoprecipitated with either anti-Akt1 antibody (1:500) or anti-Akt2 antibody (1:500) overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were immobilized using protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C and washed three times with the same buffer. The precipitated proteins were eluted in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated using 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies. The proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The synthetic peptide containing the heparin-binding domain (amino acids 196–199) and nine additional amino acids of mouse IGFBP-2, 188KHLSLEEPKKLRP200 (referred to as HBD peptide), and control peptide for HBD peptide (AALSLEEPAALAP) were synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Core Facility at the University of North Carolina. Purity and sequence confirmation were determined by mass spectrometry. The synthetic peptide for heparin-binding domain of IGFBP5 (201RKGFYKRKQCKPSRGRKR218) was also generated using the same method as mentioned above. The IGFBP-2-HBD peptide was pegylated as follows: 10 mg of peptide was mixed with 380 μg of methoxy PEG maleimide (20,000 kDa) (1:3 molar ratio peptide to PEG) (Jenkem Biotechnology) in 4.0 ml of 0.05 m NaPO4, pH 7.0. Following an overnight incubation at 4 °C, cysteine was added to a final concentration of 17 mm to block untreated sites. To remove the nonpegylated peptide and cysteine, the mixture was desalted using a Zebra Desalt spin column (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions. Pegylation was verified by SDS-PAGE analysis with Coomassie staining. The cells were starved with serum-free medium overnight and then exposed to 0 or 50 ng/ml IGF-I for 10 min. They were suspended in 100 μl of PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated with biotinylated BP2 (final concentration, 28 nm) and/or HBD (140 nm) for 4 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The proteins from supernatants were separated by 12.5% of SDS-PAGE and detected using HRP-conjugated avidin. Igfbp2−/− mice were administered with PBS or PEG-HBD peptide (50 μg/day) intraperitoneally five times/week from 6 to 9 weeks of age. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was performed before the initiation of treatment. The mice were injected with 20 mg/kg calcein intraperitoneally 7 and 2 days before sample collection. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry for whole body and femoral areal bone mineral density (aBMD, g/cm2) and body composition exclusive of the head were performed using the PIXImus (GE-Lunar) as described previously (10DeMambro V.E. Clemmons D.R. Horton L.G. Bouxsein M.L. Wood T.L. Beamer W.G. Canalis E. Rosen C.J. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 2051-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Microarchitecture of distal trabecular bone and midshaft cortical bone were analyzed with femurs and vertebrae (L5) by high resolution microcomputed tomography (MicroCT40; Scanco Medical AG, Switzerland). Approximately 100 CT slices were measured just proximal to the distal growth plate, using an isotropic voxel size of 12 μm. Midshaft cortical bone properties were analyzed in a similar fashion using 18 CT slices obtained at the midfemoral diaphysis. In vivo histomorphometry differences were analyzed between Igfbp2−/− mice treated with PBS or PEG-HBD peptide at 9 weeks of age. The mice were injected with 20 mg/kg calcein intraperitoneally 7 and 2 days before sample collection. The femurs were analyzed as described previously (10DeMambro V.E. Clemmons D.R. Horton L.G. Bouxsein M.L. Wood T.L. Beamer W.G. Canalis E. Rosen C.J. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 2051-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Femoral biomechanical properties were compared by three-point bending between Igfbp2−/− mice treated with PBS or PEG-HBD peptide at 9 weeks of age. Load was applied at a constant rate (0.05 mm/s) until failure. We measured maximum load (newtons), bending stiffness (newtons/mm), and work-to-failure (newtons/mm) from the load displacement curve and computed the apparent elastic modulus and ultimate strength using the relevant midfemoral cross-sectional geometry measured from microCT. BrdUrd (100 μg/g of BW) and FdU (12 μg/g of BW) were injected intraperitoneally in 2-week-old male mice. 2 h after of injection femurs were collected and fixed in 4% phosphonoformic acid overnight at 4 °C. The femurs were decalcified using 15% EDTA (pH 7.4) for 5 days and sectioned. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% H2O2 in PBS, and the sections were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:200; Sigma B8434) overnight at 4 °C. The sections were then incubated with a biotinylated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody followed by the incubation with streptavidin-biotinylated HRP complex and visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. All of the data are expressed as the means ± S.E. The results were analyzed for statistically significant differences using Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison post hoc test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Previously, we reported that male Igfbp2−/− mice exhibited an osteopenic phenotype with low bone formation and that osteoblastogenesis was impaired in BMSCs from Igfbp2−/− mice compared with wild-type cells. Interestingly, male Igfbp2−/− mice have a profound reduction in osteoblast number that accounts for the reduction in bone volume fraction in the tibia and femur, although the percentage of osteoblast apoptosis by TUNEL staining did not differ between Igfbp2−/− and Igfbp2+/+. To investigate whether the HBD of IGFBP-2 could be responsible for the phenotype of the Igfbp2−/− mouse, we generated a synthetic peptide (the HBD peptide) that does not bind IGFs and that contains the HBD of IGFBP-2, and tested its effect on osteoblastogenesis in vitro. To confirm the specificity of the HBD peptide, we also made a control peptide and analyzed its effect on osteogenesis. The control peptide did not enhance mineralization of Igfbp2−/− COBs compared with PBS-treated cells, whereas the HBD peptide stimulated COB mineralization (Fig. 1A). Based on this, PBS was used as controls for further studies. To prolong the half-life of the HBD peptide such that it was feasible to undertake in vivo studies, pegylation of the HBD peptide was performed (PEG-HBD). Igfbp2−/− COBs and BMSCs were cultured in osteogenic medium in the presence of PBS, the PEG-HBD peptide, or the HBD peptide. Both PEG-HBD and HBD peptide enhanced osteogenesis as measured by alkaline phosphatase and Alizarin Red staining (Fig. 1, A–C). Consistent with this, ALP, Runx2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2), and OC (osteocalcin) expression was enhanced in BMSCs treated with PEG-HBD- versus PBS-treated cells (Fig. 1D). Thus, there was no difference between the pegylated form of HBD and the HBD itself with respect to induction of osteogenesis. To further understand the anabolic effect of HBD on the skeleton, we next collected metacarpals from 1-day-old mice, incubated them with osteogenic medium in the absence of fetal calf serum, and tested the effects of the HBD peptide on osteogenesis. Bone accrual was evaluated by the longitudinal length of the calcein-incorporated area as well as the width and length of the whole metacarpals. The control peptide had no effect on the calcein-incorporated area, and the length and width of the whole metacarpals were comparable with the metacarpals treated with PBS (Fig. 1, E–H). Hence PBS was used as the control for further studies. IGFBP-2 and the HBD peptide significantly enhanced the calcein-incorporated area of metacarpals (Fig. 1, I and J). IGF-I also stimulated expansion of the calcein-incorporated area to a similar extent as IGFBP-2 and the HBD peptide (Fig. 1, I and J). When metacarpals were treated with IGF-I together with the HBD peptide, the metacarpals displayed further enhancement of the calcein-incorporated area (Fig. 1, I and J). In addition, IGFBP-2 and HBD peptide also increased the width of the whole metacarpals, implying that IGFBP-2 has an important role in periosteal expansion (Fig. 1, K and L). Because other IGFBPs possess HBD regions as well as IGFBP-2, we analyzed whether the osteogenic effect of the HBD is specific for this region in IGFBP-2 or whether the HBD in other forms of IGFBPs also had this effect. For this purpose, we prepared a peptide that contained the HBD region of IGFBP-5 (BP5-HBD) in which the amino acid sequence is quite similar to the HBD in the C-terminal region of IGFBP-2 and determined its effect on osteogenesis. We cultured Igfbp2-deficient COBs in the presence of BP5-HBD and found that BP5-HBD did not show any enhancement of differentiation or mineralization compared with PBS-treated cells (Fig. 2A). Second, we collected metacarpals and cultured them in osteogenic medium with or without BP5-HBD. BP5-HBD had no effect on the calcein-incorporated area, length, or width of whole metacarpals (Fig. 2, B–E). These data suggest that the effect of the HBD on skeletal acquisition is likely specific to IGFBP-2. Next, we tested whether the HBD peptide could enhance bone mass in vivo. After calculating the half-life of PEG-HBD (data not shown) in vivo, we administered 50 μg of PEG-HBD five times per week for 3 weeks to Igfbp2 −/− mice starting at 6 weeks of age. Because administration of pegylated control peptide in female C57BL/6J mice did not show any difference in terms of the change in aBMD compared with the treatment with PBS, PBS was used as a control in the in vivo study (supplemental Fig. S1). We first analyzed whether PEG-HBD could reverse the bone loss observed in the Igfbp2−/− male mice. At base line, aBMD and areal bone mineral content (aBMC)/BW did not differ between Igfbp2−/− mice treated with PBS or PEG-HBD (supplemental Table S1). As expected, Igfbp2+/+ mice treated with PBS had higher trabecular bone volume by microCT compared with PBS-treated Igfbp2−/− mice (Table 1). In Igfbp2−/− mice, 3 weeks of treatment with PEG-HBD enhanced aBMD and aBMC/BW compared with PBS, although it did not reach a statistical significance (supplemental Table S1). MicroCT revealed a higher trabecular bone volume fraction and greater trabecular thickness in both the distal femur and L5 vertebrae of Igfbp2−/− mice treated with PEG-HBD- versus PBS-treated Igfbp2−/− mice. (Fig. 3A and TABLE 1, TABLE 2). At the femoral midshaft, cortical thickness was not affected by PEG-HBD treatment, but total bone area was increased in PEG-HBD-treated Igfbp2−/− mice versus PBS-treated Igfbp2−/− mice (Table 1). This is consistent with an effect of PEG-HBD on periosteal expansion that was also noted in the metacarpal assay. The cortical bone changes were associated with a modest albeit nonsignificant increase in strength parameters analyzed by a three-point bending assay (supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, 3 weeks of treatment with PEG-HBD did not have any effect on the width and morphology of growth plate, which is consistent with the ex vivo metacarpal culture findings that the HBD did not affect the length of whole metacarpals (supplemental Fig. S3).TABLE 1MicroCT analysis of femurs from PBS-treated IGFBP2+/+ and PBS or PEG-HBD peptide-treated IGFBP2−/− male micePBSPEG-HBDIgfbp2+/+ (n = 8)Igfbp2−/− (n = 12)Igfbp2−/− (n = 6)MidshaftCortical thickness (mm)0.198 ± 0.0070.197 ± 0.0030.200 ± 0.006Bone area (mm2)0.889 ± 0.0470.868 ± 0.0180.903 ± 0.024Total area (mm2)1.970 ± 0.0621.955 ± 0.0362.076 ± 0.031bp < 0.05 versus Igfbp2−/− with PBS.Bone area/total area0.449 ± 0.0110.444 ± 0.0060.435 ± 0.014Distal femurBone volume/total volume0.143 ± 0.0170.095 ± 0.007ap < 0.01 versus Igfbp2+/+ with PBS.0.125 ± 0.012cp < 0.05 versus Igfbp2−/− with PBS.Trabecular number (1/mm)4.86 ± 0.164.29 ± 0.09ap < 0.01 versus Igfbp2+/+ with PBS.4.47 ± 0.15Trabecular thickness (mm)0.047 ± 0.0030.041 ± 0.0010.048 ± 0.002dp < 0.01 versus Igfbp2−/− with PBS.Trabecular spacing (mm)0.200 ± 0.0070.230 ± 0.005ap < 0.01 versus Igfbp2+/+ with PBS.0.221 ± 0.008a p < 0.01 versus Igfbp2+/+ with PBS.b p < 0.05 versus Igfbp2−/− with PBS.c p < 0.05 versus Igfbp2−/− with PBS.d p < 0.01 versus Igfbp2−/− with PBS.

https://openalex.org/W2056988908,"Reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) function has been linked to secondary complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We previously found that there is increased eNOS function after SAH but that it is uncoupled, leading to secondary complications such as vasospasm, microthromboembolism and neuronal apoptosis. Here we test the hypothesis that recoupling eNOS with simvastatin can prevent these complications. SAH was created in mice that were treated with vehicle or simvastatin starting 2 weeks before or 30 minutes after SAH. SAH increased phosphorylated eNOS which was prevented by pre- or post-treatment with simvastatin. Simvastatin pre-treatment also prevented the increase in eNOS monomer formation that was associated with SAH, decreased superoxide anion radical production and increased NO. These changes were associated with decreased vasospasm, microthromboemboli and neuronal injury. The data suggest that simvastatin re-couples eNOS after SAH, leading to decreased secondary complications such as vasospasm, microthromboemboli and neuronal injury."
https://openalex.org/W2109095850,"Cross-site comparison studies of behavioral variation can provide evidence for traditions in wild species once ecological and genetic factors are excluded as causes for cross-site differences. These studies ensure behavior variants are considered within the context of a species' ecology and evolutionary adaptations. We examined wide-scale geographic variation in the behavior of spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) across five long-term field sites in Central America using a well established ethnographic cross-site survey method. Spider monkeys possess a relatively rare social system with a high degree of fission-fusion dynamics, also typical of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and humans (Homo sapiens). From the initial 62 behaviors surveyed 65% failed to meet the necessary criteria for traditions. The remaining 22 behaviors showed cross-site variation in occurrence ranging from absent through to customary, representing to our knowledge, the first documented cases of traditions in this taxon and only the second case of multiple traditions in a New World monkey species. Of the 22 behavioral variants recorded across all sites, on average 57% occurred in the social domain, 19% in food-related domains and 24% in other domains. This social bias contrasts with the food-related bias reported in great ape cross-site comparison studies and has implications for the evolution of human culture. No pattern of geographical radiation was found in relation to distance across sites. Our findings promote A. geoffroyi as a model species to investigate traditions with field and captive based experiments and emphasize the importance of the social domain for the study of animal traditions."

https://openalex.org/W2011365502,"Introduction Nutrient profiling is defined as the science of categorising foods based on their nutrient composition. The Choices Programme is a nutrient profile system with criteria that determine whether foods are eligible to carry a “healthier option” stamp. The Daily Menu Method which has been developed to evaluate these criteria is described here. This method simulates the change in calculated nutrient intakes which would be the result of consumers changing their diets in favour of food products that comply with the criteria. Methods Average intakes of energy, trans fatty acids (TFA), saturated fatty acids (SAFA), sodium, added sugar and fibre were derived from dietary intake studies and food consumption surveys of 7 countries: The Netherlands, Greece, Spain, the USA, Israel, China and South Africa. For each of the key nutrients, these average intakes were translated into three Typical Daily Menus per country. Average intakes based on these three menus were compared with average intakes from three Choices Daily Menus. To compose the Choices Menus, foods from the Typical Menus that did not comply with the Choices criteria were replaced with foods that did comply and are available on the market. Results Comparison of intakes from the Choices Menus with the survey data showed that calculated intakes of energy, SAFA, TFA, sodium and added sugar were reduced. Fibre intakes were increased. The size of the effect differed per country. Conclusion The Daily Menu Method is a useful means to predict the potential effects of nutrient profiles such as the Choices criteria, on daily nutrient intakes. The method can be applied internationally and confirms that the criteria of the Choices Programme are in line with the aim of the programme: to improve nutrient intakes in the direction of the recommendations."

Now, with 128 exomes sequenced and 39 rare diseases diagnosed, the program's success is paving the way for widespread personal genomics while pioneering new techniques for reigning in the “tsunami” of genomics data. Two years ago, NIH's Undiagnosed Diseases Program began delivering genomics to the clinic on an unprecedented scale. Now, with 128 exomes sequenced and 39 rare diseases diagnosed, the program's success is paving the way for widespread personal genomics while pioneering new techniques for reigning in the “tsunami” of genomics data. In 2009, a healthy Colombian couple watched their two sons suffer from a mysterious neurological illness, featuring seizures, tremors, and other complications. When the younger son succumbed to the illness at age 13, the family decided to try a new approach. They enrolled their elder son, who will be referred to here as Carlos, in NIH's Undiagnosed Diseases Program, a trans-institute initiative dedicated to deciphering the cause of rare, mysterious health conditions. The Undiagnosed Diseases Program at NIH started in May 2008 as a pilot program with initial funding of $280,000. Since then, it has grown to include ∼75 physicians and scientists from almost every institution at NIH, including endocrinologists, immunologists, oncologists, and cardiologists. The team now works together on ∼300 cases with $3.5 million in funding each year. What sets the program apart from other large clinical projects is their state-of-the-art genetic analyses. The team's Illumina platforms can sequence the entire exome—that is, the 180,000 exons in the human genome—of a patient and his family in only ∼9 weeks. In addition, high-resolution microarrays can genotype a million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for each family member, providing information about the remaining 99% of the genome—the introns and noncoding regions. In this way, the Undiagnosed Diseases Program is leading the charge in bringing genomics to the clinic. So why is this type of clinical genomics not routinely available outside the NIH? Although the price of sequencing has dropped to roughly $15,000 per genome or about $3000 for an exome, data storage and the ensuing analysis remains too costly, too laborious, and frankly too inefficient to put into common practice in the clinic. It's cheap and fast to sequence, but to glean diagnostic information from the data is still quite laborious and costly. But recent successes by the Undiagnosed Diseases Program are shifting this trend. First, the program is learning how to identify patients who might benefit most from genomic analysis. Second, the team has developed tools for quickly narrowing down the flood of genomics data to a handful of candidate genes for functional tests. With these new strategies, the program has made 39 diagnoses, including the team's first reported discovery of a new disease, which was published last month in The New England Journal of Medicine. Through the program, “scientists and clinicians will get an understanding of the difficulties involved in next-gen sequencing, as well as the benefits; of what cases are appropriate for genomic study and of what filters should be applied to the data, “ says William Gahl, the program's director and clinical director of the National Human Genome Research Institute. Before Carlos and his family arrived at the NIH Clinical Center, their first major hurdle was acceptance into the program. The NIH has received ∼4600 inquiries for the program and ∼1700 applications, but it has enrolled only 380 cases. In general, the program selects patients whose maladies appear genetic in origin, based on their family history or a sign that their symptoms have a shared underlying cause. Typically, the NIH team first attempts to diagnose illnesses by looking for known genetic markers and using standard molecular and biochemical tests that are commercially available. However, if they have no good leads on the disease and therefore no candidate genes to search for, they'll look to a patient's whole exome. An entire exome yields an overload of information, however, and must be carefully edited. Exome sequences typically vary at about 20,000 places, explains Thomas Markello, a clinician involved with the program at NHGRI. This vast variation makes it nearly impossible to find 1–2 rare alleles underlying a mysterious disease. In other words, the nucleotide haystack is just too big. After some trial-and-error, the team has developed a strategy to quickly shrink the haystack: they eliminate many variants by comparing the patient's DNA with genomic information from the family. This added information enhances the signal-to-noise ratio and allows them to reduce the number of candidate genes. “Data reduction is pretty much everything,” Markello says. “It's simply not worth doing whole exome sequencing on a single individual,” says Gahl, “when the clinical manifestations don't point to a specific group of genes.” With family information, the team can apply classical pedigree tools reminiscent of population genetics in the 1970s to filter out mutations that don't follow predicted modes of Mendelian inheritance. And DNA from healthy family members allows them to eliminate harmless variations that run in the family but don't lead to the disease. “Family data makes a fundamental difference,” says David Adams, an NHGRI clinician who worked on Carlos's case. “You don't just need family history; we've learned you need family DNA to succeed.” So for Carlos's case, the geneticists sequenced his exome, as well as that of his parents and his deceased brother. In general, the team gets ∼88% of the complete exome with 99.9% confidence. The exome data from Carlos and his family initially generated ∼120,000 variants for program geneticists to sift through. Remarkably, the team then narrowed this list to three candidate genes using a series of software programs developed internally at the NIH. The geneticists first align the patient's exome with a reference sequence (typically the one generated in the Human Genome Project) and exclude unlikely candidate mutations according to a kill-list of variants present in more than 1% of exomes and genomes stored in databases from two separate projects, NIH's ClinSeq and the 1000 Genomes Project. Mutations are then ranked by how severely they alter the coding sequence. For example, a mutation encoding a stop codon is considered more severe than one with no effect on the resulting amino acid. Another in-house software program then eliminates mutations if their inheritance pattern doesn't match that of the disease. For example, Carlos's disease appeared to follow a recessive mode of inheritance, and thus, his team kept only the variants that behaved accordingly. Finally, the team exports the results to their program VarSifter, which lists the candidate variants in order from least to most likely. Currently, some of this software is available to the scientific community, and according to NHGRI's Nancy Hansen, the entire suite may be released once it's optimized so that clinicians and scientists might follow the lead of the Undiagnosed Diseases Program. Although the program's strategy is still evolving, this “whittling down” approach is producing results. At the end of 2010, the program identified the root of Carlos's neurological symptoms, and a report on the teen's diagnosis is pending publication. And data from the Undiagnosed Diseases Program team also helped Manfred Boehm at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute quickly locate the mutation behind a mysterious vascular calcification disorder. The team handed him a list of 100 candidate genes, and within ∼1 month he had pinpointed mutations in the NT5E gene as the causal culprit. NT5E encodes a membrane-bound nucleotidase involved in extracellular ATP metabolism. Boehm's study identified in three families numerous mutations, which destroy the activity of the nucleotidase. By targeting this enzyme, clinicians may soon be able to treat a disease that didn't even have a name a few months ago. The study was published last month in The New England Journal of Medicine. In contrast, Boehm says, a couple of years ago, NIH geneticists handed him a list of 2000 genes potentially underlying a known disorder, and a year passed before he could identify the causal mutation. Thus far, the program has diagnosed 39 cases—3 of which are neurological and muscular diseases discovered through exome analysis. Another 3 were discovered with SNP analysis, whereas the remaining cases were diagnosed with commercial tests, including the identification of the rare disease congenital disorder of glycosylation type 2B. The Undiagnosed Diseases team also counts concise lists of candidate mutations as partial successes. These “short lists” are handed off to bench scientists for functional studies on how the mutations contribute to disease. Right now, these collaborations are currently all within the NIH. But program leaders say they'll work with basic researchers outside of the NIH once they've established a portal for collaboration. Marjan Huizing, a metabolic disorders researcher at NHGRI, is not involved with the program but says she's “piggybacking” off their exomic techniques. She studies endocytic trafficking defects that lead to albinism, bleeding, and infections. Traditional candidate gene approaches have frustrated her team. They spent 12 years screening patients for candidate genes and never found the right one. So she decided to follow in the program's lead and analyze the exomes of three patients. Right off the bat, she identified the causal mutation underlying two of the cases. For the third, more difficult case, she's planning to sequence the patient's parents. In the meantime, geneticists are keeping an eye on the program for clues about the nature of rare diseases and whether sequencing alone can identify “medically actionable alleles,” says Harvard genomicist George Church. “If that turns out to be true, it's a paradigm shift.” Although the clinicians at the Undiagnosed Diseases Program echo Church's curiosity, they keep the focus tightly on their patients. The thrill of a diagnosis through genomics is a triumph for scientists and clinicians, but it means even more to patients and their loved ones, who have sought explanations for years. Still, it is a bittersweet success. Carlos now has a name to call his malady, but there remains no cure or powerful drug to combat it. “Even when we get lucky, the best we can do is offer hope to the patient that down the road, someone might use the diagnosis to develop a treatment,” says John Gallin, director of the NIH Clinical Center. “Our patients have referred to this as the House of Hope, but from the perspective of a care provider, I wish I could do even more.”"

(Heterocephalus glaber) is a unique organism in the mammalian order rodentia. It is an attractive model to study aging due to an extraordinary life span (more than 28 years), which is unprecedented for rodents of similar body size. Aging in MRs is characterized by very slow age-related declines that do not significantly affect breeding capacity, social behavior, and daily activity (1Buffenstein R. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2005; 60: 1369-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 2Buffenstein R. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 2008; 178: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 3Edrey Y.H. Park T.J. Kang H. Biney A. Buffenstein R. Exp. Gerontol. 2011; 46: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). MR evolved a unique eusocial lifestyle with strictly determined social roles and cooperative breeding within the colony. The anatomy of MR has several specific features, which probably evolved as an adaptation to living underground in oxygen-limiting conditions, including underdevelopment of the visual system (4McMullen C.A. Andrade F.H. Crish S.D. Anat. Rec. 2010; 293: 918-923Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), skin insensitivity (5Park T.J. Lu Y. Jüttner R. Smith E.S. Hu J. Brand A. Wetzel C. Milenkovic N. Erdmann B. Heppenstall P.A. Laurito C.E. Wilson S.P. Lewin G.R. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e13Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and the ability to tolerate low temperature (6Woodley R. Buffenstein R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2002; 133: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and low oxygen levels (7Larson J. Park T.J. Neuroreport. 2009; 20: 1634-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). MRs are also characterized by a decreased metabolic rate, which is associated with reduced levels of thyroid hormones (3Edrey Y.H. Park T.J. Kang H. Biney A. Buffenstein R. Exp. Gerontol. 2011; 46: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). One of the most remarkable features of MR is that none of the autopsies of dead animals in several colonies revealed cancer incidence (1Buffenstein R. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2005; 60: 1369-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Moreover, primary fibroblasts derived from MR were sensitive to contact inhibition (8Seluanov A. Hine C. Azpurua J. Feigenson M. Bozzella M. Mao Z. Catania K.C. Gorbunova V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19352-19357Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), resistant to experimentally induced tumorigenesis, and unable to form xenograft tumors (9Liang S. Mele J. Wu Y. Buffenstein R. Hornsby P.J. Aging Cell. 2010; 9: 626-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).MR poses a challenge to the theories that link aging, cancer, and oxidative stress. Because MR lives in low oxygen conditions, it is expected to have low levels of oxidative stress. However, research showed that MR is characterized by significant oxidative damage. Compared with mice, MRs have a lower GSH/GSSG ratio, higher rate of lipid peroxidation, higher rate of DNA oxidative damage, and higher protein carbonylation (10Andziak B. O'Connor T.P. Qi W. DeWaal E.M. Pierce A. Chaudhuri A.R. Van Remmen H. Buffenstein R. Aging Cell. 2006; 5: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that MR proteins possess higher levels of protein thiols, increased protein stability, increased resistance to urea-induced denaturation, and elevated proteasomal activity while also showing lower levels of protein ubiquitination. Moreover, unlike the mouse proteome, the MR proteome did not show significant age-related susceptibility to oxidation and ubiquitination (11Pérez V.I. Buffenstein R. Masamsetti V. Leonard S. Salmon A.B. Mele J. Andziak B. Yang T. Edrey Y. Friguet B. Ward W. Richardson A. Chaudhuri A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). A separate study did not detect age-related changes in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including Mn-superoxide dismutase, Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, and catalase, and also observed low glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity (12Andziak B. O'Connor T.P. Buffenstein R. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Mammals have eight GPxs, including five selenoproteins. GPx1 is the first identified and one of the best studied selenoproteins (13Mills G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 229: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This and other selenoprotein GPxs have selenocysteine (Sec) residues in their active sites. GPx1 is a cytosolic enzyme and the most abundant selenoprotein in mammals. Other GPxs show different cellular localizations and/or tissue and substrate specificities (14Lei X.G. Cheng W.H. McClung J.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2007; 27: 41-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 15Lubos E. Loscalzo J. Handy D.E. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; (in press)Google Scholar). GPx1 is not an essential enzyme (i.e. GPx1 knock-out mice are viable and fertile). However, GPx1 knock-out mice are more susceptible to oxidative stress (16de Haan J.B. Bladier C. Griffiths P.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Expression of GPx1 is decreased in prostate cancer and breast cancer cell lines (19Gladyshev V.N. Factor V.M. Housseau F. Hatfield D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) as well as in the mouse model of liver cancer (20Esworthy R.S. Baker M.A. Chu F.F. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 957-962PubMed Google Scholar). A single nucleotide polymorphism that changes Pro to Leu at codon 198 of human GPx1 is associated with lung (21Moscow J.A. Schmidt L. Ingram D.T. Gnarra J. Johnson B. Cowan K.H. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2769-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and bladder (22Ichimura Y. Habuchi T. Tsuchiya N. Wang L. Oyama C. Sato K. Nishiyama H. Ogawa O. Kato T. J. Urol. 2004; 172: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) cancers.Currently, there is no information on the utilization of selenium by MR; however, this is an essential trace element in mammals, and its supplementation may be beneficial in cancer chemoprevention (23Fairweather-Tait S.J. Bao Y. Broadley M.R. Collings R. Ford D. Hesketh J.E. Hurst R. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1337-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Selenium functions mostly through incorporation into proteins in the form of Sec. Mice and humans have 24 and 25 selenoprotein genes, respectively (24Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigó R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the composition of the MR selenoproteome.In this study, we observed low levels of selenium in MR tissues. This observation led to the finding that the reduced utilization of selenium by this organism was due to a specific defect in GPx1 expression.DISCUSSIONGPx1 is an abundant glutathione peroxidase in mammals. It plays an important role in the protection of cells from oxidative stress by reducing hydrogen peroxide with glutathione. Surprisingly, we found that GPx1 is essentially absent in MR tissues, whereas other selenoproteins are expressed at normal levels and/or are enzymatically competent. Sequencing and analysis of the MR liver transcriptome detected GPx1 mRNA, but it was present at low levels and had an early termination codon. Further analyses revealed that the low expression was probably due to a combination of low mRNA levels and decreased insertion of Sec rather than due to compromised GPx1 activity caused by premature termination.It was reported that GPx1 is the most abundant liver selenoprotein. In rat liver, it accounts for 63% of the total selenium (36Behne D. Wolters W. J. Nutr. 1983; 113: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Selenium deficiency induces rapid degradation of GPx1 mRNA (and several other selenoprotein mRNAs), whereas the expression levels of several additional selenoproteins are preserved under these conditions (37Sunde R.A. Raines A.M. Barnes K.M. Evenson J.K. Biosci. Rep. 2009; 29: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). GPx1 was proposed as a biomarker of selenium utilization because its activity is very sensitive to selenium dietary status. It was also suggested that GPx1 is a “selenium buffer,” wherein this enzyme stores selenium and provides this element for biosynthesis of selenoproteins during selenium deficiency (38Sunde R.A. Thompson B.M. Palm M.D. Weiss S.L. Thompson K.M. Evenson J.K. Biomed. Environ. Sci. 1997; 10: 346-355PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, GPx1 knock-out does not affect expression of other selenoproteins (39Lei X.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40Lei X.G. Cheng W.H. J. Nutr. 2005; 135: 2295-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This enzyme is also not essential. GPx1 knock-out animals are viable; however, they are more susceptible to oxidative stress and show defects in redox signaling (41Lei X.G. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These data correlate with previously reported increases in oxidative stress parameters in MR, including a low GSH/GSSG ratio, high rate of DNA oxidative damage, and increased protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation (10Andziak B. O'Connor T.P. Qi W. DeWaal E.M. Pierce A. Chaudhuri A.R. Van Remmen H. Buffenstein R. Aging Cell. 2006; 5: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Moreover, both GPx1 knock-out mice and MRs showed abnormal blood glucose regulation (39Lei X.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40Lei X.G. Cheng W.H. J. Nutr. 2005; 135: 2295-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These mice had a normal fasting glucose but reduced blood insulin levels (41Lei X.G. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 42Wang X. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Roneker C.A. Pepper M.P. Hu L.G. Simmons R.A. Lei X.G. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, unlike GPx1 knock-out mice, MR also showed abnormal glucose tolerance (glucose levels remained elevated for prolonged periods of time) and insulin sensitivity (glucose levels immediately decreased upon insulin administration and remained low for prolonged periods of time) (10Andziak B. O'Connor T.P. Qi W. DeWaal E.M. Pierce A. Chaudhuri A.R. Van Remmen H. Buffenstein R. Aging Cell. 2006; 5: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 43Kramer B. Buffenstein R. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2004; 139: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, GPx1 knock-out mice had reduced islet β-cell mass in pancreatic tissue (42Wang X. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Roneker C.A. Pepper M.P. Hu L.G. Simmons R.A. Lei X.G. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas MR had different abundances of the four distinct types of islet cells. Although the abnormal glucose regulation may be relevant to MR adaptation to its specific lifestyle, it could be, at least in part, due to an abnormal GPx1 function.Selenium levels in animal tissues vary depending on many factors, including the requirements of the organism for this trace element and the diet. Numerous studies have reported on the role of dietary selenium in human health. For example, selenium deficiency may cause endemic cardiomyopathy (Keshan disease), liver degeneration observed in rats and pigs, and white muscle disease in ruminants and turkeys (23Fairweather-Tait S.J. Bao Y. Broadley M.R. Collings R. Ford D. Hesketh J.E. Hurst R. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1337-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 44Mueller A.S. Fischer J. Most E. Pallauf J. J. Anim. Physiol. Anim. Nutr. 2009; 93: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). None of the selenium deficiency-induced pathologies have been reported for MR. In this regard, it is particularly interesting that MRs have never been observed to develop cancer (2Buffenstein R. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 2008; 178: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We compared trace element profiles in control and GPx1 knock-out mice and found a significant decrease of tissue selenium levels in liver and kidney. Somewhat similar differences in selenium levels were observed between mouse and MR. GPx1 is the most abundant selenoprotein, especially in liver and kidney, and the GPx1 knock-out data suggest that this protein accounts for approximately half of selenium in these organs.We also observed significant differences in selenium in spleen, lungs, and testes (these tissues depend on selenium provided by SelP). This selenoprotein is the only mammalian protein that contains multiple Sec residues (31Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 1441-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Previously, we suggested that the number of Sec residues in SelP might be used as an indirect genetic marker of selenium utilization (45Lobanov A.V. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Genome Biol. 2008; 9: R62Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In rodents and primates, the Sec content of SelP is almost twice as low as in aquatic vertebrates. Comparison of rodent SelPs shows that C. porcellus and MR SelPs have 7 Sec residues, which is the lowest number of SelP Sec residues in vertebrates. MR, porcupine, and C. porcellus are closer to each other and are more distant from other rodents, such as mice, rats, and rabbits (46Gorbunova V. Bozzella M.J. Seluanov A. Age. 2008; 30: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our analysis of GPx1 expression suggested a decreased GPx1 expression in MR and porcupine, and previous research revealed low GPx1 activity in C. porcellus (47Jensen C. Pallauf J. J. Anim. Physiol. Anim. Nutr. 2008; 92: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Overall, these data suggest a possible loss of GPx1 function in this specific group of rodents and, as a consequence, a reduced requirement for selenium by these organisms. It is remarkable that such an important selenoprotein is compromised in these animals, which survived for tens of millions of years essentially without GPx1.

However, nothing is known about the composition of the MR selenoproteome.In this study, we observed low levels of selenium in MR tissues. This observation led to the finding that the reduced utilization of selenium by this organism was due to a specific defect in GPx1 expression. Naked mole rat (MR) 2The abbreviations used are: MR, naked mole rat (H. glaber); ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; GPx, glutathione peroxidase; MsrA, methionine-S-sulfoxide reductase; MsrB, methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase; Sec, selenocysteine; SECIS, selenocysteine insertion sequence; SelP, selenoprotein P; XFM, x-ray fluorescence microscopy; contig, group of overlapping clones; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. (Heterocephalus glaber) is a unique organism in the mammalian order rodentia. It is an attractive model to study aging due to an extraordinary life span (more than 28 years), which is unprecedented for rodents of similar body size. Aging in MRs is characterized by very slow age-related declines that do not significantly affect breeding capacity, social behavior, and daily activity (1Buffenstein R. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2005; 60: 1369-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 2Buffenstein R. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 2008; 178: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 3Edrey Y.H. Park T.J. Kang H. Biney A. Buffenstein R. Exp. Gerontol. 2011; 46: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). MR evolved a unique eusocial lifestyle with strictly determined social roles and cooperative breeding within the colony. The anatomy of MR has several specific features, which probably evolved as an adaptation to living underground in oxygen-limiting conditions, including underdevelopment of the visual system (4McMullen C.A. Andrade F.H. Crish S.D. Anat. Rec. 2010; 293: 918-923Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), skin insensitivity (5Park T.J. Lu Y. Jüttner R. Smith E.S. Hu J. Brand A. Wetzel C. Milenkovic N. Erdmann B. Heppenstall P.A. Laurito C.E. Wilson S.P. Lewin G.R. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e13Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and the ability to tolerate low temperature (6Woodley R. Buffenstein R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2002; 133: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and low oxygen levels (7Larson J. Park T.J. Neuroreport. 2009; 20: 1634-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). MRs are also characterized by a decreased metabolic rate, which is associated with reduced levels of thyroid hormones (3Edrey Y.H. Park T.J. Kang H. Biney A. Buffenstein R. Exp. Gerontol. 2011; 46: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). One of the most remarkable features of MR is that none of the autopsies of dead animals in several colonies revealed cancer incidence (1Buffenstein R. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2005; 60: 1369-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Moreover, primary fibroblasts derived from MR were sensitive to contact inhibition (8Seluanov A. Hine C. Azpurua J. Feigenson M. Bozzella M. Mao Z. Catania K.C. Gorbunova V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19352-19357Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), resistant to experimentally induced tumorigenesis, and unable to form xenograft tumors (9Liang S. Mele J. Wu Y. Buffenstein R. Hornsby P.J. Aging Cell. 2010; 9: 626-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). MR poses a challenge to the theories that link aging, cancer, and oxidative stress. Because MR lives in low oxygen conditions, it is expected to have low levels of oxidative stress. However, research showed that MR is characterized by significant oxidative damage. Compared with mice, MRs have a lower GSH/GSSG ratio, higher rate of lipid peroxidation, higher rate of DNA oxidative damage, and higher protein carbonylation (10Andziak B. O'Connor T.P. Qi W. DeWaal E.M. Pierce A. Chaudhuri A.R. Van Remmen H. Buffenstein R. Aging Cell. 2006; 5: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that MR proteins possess higher levels of protein thiols, increased protein stability, increased resistance to urea-induced denaturation, and elevated proteasomal activity while also showing lower levels of protein ubiquitination. Moreover, unlike the mouse proteome, the MR proteome did not show significant age-related susceptibility to oxidation and ubiquitination (11Pérez V.I. Buffenstein R. Masamsetti V. Leonard S. Salmon A.B. Mele J. Andziak B. Yang T. Edrey Y. Friguet B. Ward W. Richardson A. Chaudhuri A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). A separate study did not detect age-related changes in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including Mn-superoxide dismutase, Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, and catalase, and also observed low glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity (12Andziak B. O'Connor T.P. Buffenstein R. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Mammals have eight GPxs, including five selenoproteins. GPx1 is the first identified and one of the best studied selenoproteins (13Mills G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 229: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This and other selenoprotein GPxs have selenocysteine (Sec) residues in their active sites. GPx1 is a cytosolic enzyme and the most abundant selenoprotein in mammals. Other GPxs show different cellular localizations and/or tissue and substrate specificities (14Lei X.G. Cheng W.H. McClung J.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2007; 27: 41-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 15Lubos E. Loscalzo J. Handy D.E. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; (in press)Google Scholar). GPx1 is not an essential enzyme (i.e. GPx1 knock-out mice are viable and fertile). However, GPx1 knock-out mice are more susceptible to oxidative stress (16de Haan J.B. Bladier C. Griffiths P. Kelner M. O'Shea R.D. Cheung N.S. Bronson R.T. Silvestro M.J. Wild S. Zheng S.S. Beart P.M. Hertzog P.J. Kola I. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Expression of GPx1 is decreased in prostate cancer and breast cancer cell lines (19Gladyshev V.N. Factor V.M. Housseau F. Hatfield D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) as well as in the mouse model of liver cancer (20Esworthy R.S. Baker M.A. Chu F.F. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 957-962PubMed Google Scholar). A single nucleotide polymorphism that changes Pro to Leu at codon 198 of human GPx1 is associated with lung (21Moscow J.A. Schmidt L. Ingram D.T. Gnarra J. Johnson B. Cowan K.H. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2769-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and bladder (22Ichimura Y. Habuchi T. Tsuchiya N. Wang L. Oyama C. Sato K. Nishiyama H. Ogawa O. Kato T. J. Urol. 2004; 172: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) cancers. Currently, there is no information on the utilization of selenium by MR; however, this is an essential trace element in mammals, and its supplementation may be beneficial in cancer chemoprevention (23Fairweather-Tait S.J. Bao Y. Broadley M.R. Collings R. Ford D. Hesketh J.E. Hurst R. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1337-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Selenium functions mostly through incorporation into proteins in the form of Sec. Mice and humans have 24 and 25 selenoprotein genes, respectively (24Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigó R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the composition of the MR selenoproteome. In this study, we observed low levels of selenium in MR tissues. This observation led to the finding that the reduced utilization of selenium by this organism was due to a specific defect in GPx1 expression. DISCUSSIONGPx1 is an abundant glutathione peroxidase in mammals. It plays an important role in the protection of cells from oxidative stress by reducing hydrogen peroxide with glutathione. Surprisingly, we found that GPx1 is essentially absent in MR tissues, whereas other selenoproteins are expressed at normal levels and/or are enzymatically competent. Sequencing and analysis of the MR liver transcriptome detected GPx1 mRNA, but it was present at low levels and had an early termination codon. Further analyses revealed that the low expression was probably due to a combination of low mRNA levels and decreased insertion of Sec rather than due to compromised GPx1 activity caused by premature termination.It was reported that GPx1 is the most abundant liver selenoprotein. In rat liver, it accounts for 63% of the total selenium (36Behne D. Wolters W. J. Nutr. 1983; 113: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Selenium deficiency induces rapid degradation of GPx1 mRNA (and several other selenoprotein mRNAs), whereas the expression levels of several additional selenoproteins are preserved under these conditions (37Sunde R.A. Raines A.M. Barnes K.M. Evenson J.K. Biosci. Rep. 2009; 29: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). GPx1 was proposed as a biomarker of selenium utilization because its activity is very sensitive to selenium dietary status. It was also suggested that GPx1 is a “selenium buffer,” wherein this enzyme stores selenium and provides this element for biosynthesis of selenoproteins during selenium deficiency (38Sunde R.A. Thompson B.M. Palm M.D. Weiss S.L. Thompson K.M. Evenson J.K. Biomed. Environ. Sci. 1997; 10: 346-355PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, GPx1 knock-out does not affect expression of other selenoproteins (39Lei X.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40Lei X.G. Cheng W.H. J. Nutr. 2005; 135: 2295-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This enzyme is also not essential. GPx1 knock-out animals are viable; however, they are more susceptible to oxidative stress and show defects in redox signaling (41Lei X.G. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These data correlate with previously reported increases in oxidative stress parameters in MR, including a low GSH/GSSG ratio, high rate of DNA oxidative damage, and increased protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation (10Andziak B. O'Connor T.P. Qi W. DeWaal E.M. Pierce A. Chaudhuri A.R. Van Remmen H. Buffenstein R. Aging Cell. 2006; 5: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Moreover, both GPx1 knock-out mice and MRs showed abnormal blood glucose regulation (39Lei X.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40Lei X.G. Cheng W.H. J. Nutr. 2005; 135: 2295-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These mice had a normal fasting glucose but reduced blood insulin levels (41Lei X.G. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 42Wang X. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Roneker C.A. Pepper M.P. Hu L.G. Simmons R.A. Lei X.G. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, unlike GPx1 knock-out mice, MR also showed abnormal glucose tolerance (glucose levels remained elevated for prolonged periods of time) and insulin sensitivity (glucose levels immediately decreased upon insulin administration and remained low for prolonged periods of time) (10Andziak B. O'Connor T.P. Qi W. DeWaal E.M. Pierce A. Chaudhuri A.R. Van Remmen H. Buffenstein R. Aging Cell. 2006; 5: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 43Kramer B. Buffenstein R. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2004; 139: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, GPx1 knock-out mice had reduced islet β-cell mass in pancreatic tissue (42Wang X. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Roneker C.A. Pepper M.P. Hu L.G. Simmons R.A. Lei X.G. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas MR had different abundances of the four distinct types of islet cells. Although the abnormal glucose regulation may be relevant to MR adaptation to its specific lifestyle, it could be, at least in part, due to an abnormal GPx1 function.Selenium levels in animal tissues vary depending on many factors, including the requirements of the organism for this trace element and the diet. Numerous studies have reported on the role of dietary selenium in human health. For example, selenium deficiency may cause endemic cardiomyopathy (Keshan disease), liver degeneration observed in rats and pigs, and white muscle disease in ruminants and turkeys (23Fairweather-Tait S.J. Bao Y. Broadley M.R. Collings R. Ford D. Hesketh J.E. Hurst R. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1337-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 44Mueller A.S. Fischer J. Most E. Pallauf J. J. Anim. Physiol. Anim. Nutr. 2009; 93: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). None of the selenium deficiency-induced pathologies have been reported for MR. In this regard, it is particularly interesting that MRs have never been observed to develop cancer (2Buffenstein R. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 2008; 178: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We compared trace element profiles in control and GPx1 knock-out mice and found a significant decrease of tissue selenium levels in liver and kidney. Somewhat similar differences in selenium levels were observed between mouse and MR. GPx1 is the most abundant selenoprotein, especially in liver and kidney, and the GPx1 knock-out data suggest that this protein accounts for approximately half of selenium in these organs.We also observed significant differences in selenium in spleen, lungs, and testes (these tissues depend on selenium provided by SelP). This selenoprotein is the only mammalian protein that contains multiple Sec residues (31Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 1441-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Previously, we suggested that the number of Sec residues in SelP might be used as an indirect genetic marker of selenium utilization (45Lobanov A.V. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Genome Biol. 2008; 9: R62Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In rodents and primates, the Sec content of SelP is almost twice as low as in aquatic vertebrates. Comparison of rodent SelPs shows that C. porcellus and MR SelPs have 7 Sec residues, which is the lowest number of SelP Sec residues in vertebrates. MR, porcupine, and C. porcellus are closer to each other and are more distant from other rodents, such as mice, rats, and rabbits (46Gorbunova V. Bozzella M.J. Seluanov A. Age. 2008; 30: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our analysis of GPx1 expression suggested a decreased GPx1 expression in MR and porcupine, and previous research revealed low GPx1 activity in C. porcellus (47Jensen C. Pallauf J. J. Anim. Physiol. Anim. Nutr. 2008; 92: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Overall, these data suggest a possible loss of GPx1 function in this specific group of rodents and, as a consequence, a reduced requirement for selenium by these organisms. It is remarkable that such an important selenoprotein is compromised in these animals, which survived for tens of millions of years essentially without GPx1.

However, the physiological role of fMLP and FPR during differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells is unknown. In this study, we attempted to determine whether fMLP regulates differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow. Analysis by quantitative-PCR and flow cytometry showed significantly increased expression of FPR1, but not FPR2 and FPR3, during osteoblastic differentiation. fMLP, a specific ligand of FPR1, promotes osteoblastic commitment and suppresses adipogenic commitment under differentiation conditions. Remarkably, fMLP-stimulated osteogenesis is associated with increased expression of osteogenic markers and mineralization, which were blocked by cyclosporine H, a selective FPR1 antagonist. In addition, fMLP inhibited expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ1, a major regulator of adipocytic differentiation. fMLP-stimulated osteogenic differentiation was mediated via FPR1-phospholipase C/phospholipase D-Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase II-ERK-CREB signaling pathways. Finally, fMLP promoted bone formation in zebrafish and rabbits, suggesting its physiological relevance in vivo. Collectively, our findings provide novel insight into the functional role of fMLP in bone biology, with important implications for its potential use as a therapeutic agent for treatment of bone-related disorders.

Regulation of stem cell fate down these various lineages is essential for tissue development, homeostasis, and repair (1Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D.

Science. 1997; 276: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (4081) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed critical transcription factors involved in the commitment of different MSC-derived lineages (7Harada S. Rodan G.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). For example, osteoblastic differentiation is controlled by Runx2, whereas PPAR-γ is involved in adipose commitment. Continuous remodeling of bone occurs throughout life by a tightly coupled process involving absorption by osteoclasts and formation of osteoblasts. Dysregulation of this coupled remodeling leads to diseases such as osteoporosis (8Fulfaro F. Casuccio A. Ticozzi C. Ripamonti C. Pain. 1998; 78: 157-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 9Gangji V. Appelboom T. Clin. Rheumatol. 1999; 18: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Osteoporosis is a degenerative disease of the skeleton that occurs due to alteration of bone turnover homeostasis and is characterized by fragile bones and increased susceptibility to bone fractures (10Riggs B.L. Melton 3rd, L.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 620-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Decreased bone synthesis because of reduced osteoblastic activity, which occurs in parallel with increased adipocyte formation, is a mechanism that can lead to this degenerative disorder (11Cummings S.R. Melton L.J. Lancet. 2002; 359: 1761-1767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar). MSCs can be derived from bone marrow, manipulated in culture, and administered back to donor individuals; therefore, MSCs are of great promise in regeneration medicine, providing potential tools for use in therapeutic intervention in diseases related to impaired function of osteoblasts (12Horwitz E.M. Gordon P.L. Koo W.K. Marx J.C. Neel M.D. McNall R.Y. Muul L. Hofmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8932-8937Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 13Pittenger M.F. Martin B.J.

Science. 2005; 309: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic pathways that drive differentiation of MSCs along the osteoblast lineage are not completely understood. Therefore, elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying osteogenesis is not only important to our understanding of bone development, but it may also advance strategies for bone repair. Targeting of therapeutic molecules to bone for enhancement of bone forming activity of osteoblast precursors may aid in treatment of bone disease. For the proper action of MSCs in differentiation into a certain type of cell in a specific location, MSCs should migrate to the site of injury. Recruitment of MSCs to damaged tissues is a promising approach to in situ tissue regeneration. Formyl peptide receptor (FPR), a chemoattractant receptor belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor family (15Le Y. Murphy P.M. Wang J.M. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 541-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), binds to N-formyl peptides, such as N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), which is derived either from bacterial proteins (16Marasco W.A. Phan S.H. Krutzsch H. Showell H.J. Feltner D.E. Nairn R. Becker E.L. Ward P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5430-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or from endogenous mitochondrial proteins, and is released as a result of cell death or severe dysfunction (17Carp H. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 155: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Expression of FPR in phagocytic leukocytes and nonphagocytic cells, such as fibroblasts, has been reported (18VanCompernolle S.E. Clark K.L. Rummel K.A. Todd S.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Activation of FPR receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways is known to be responsible for various biochemical responses that contribute to the physiological defense against bacterial infection and cell disruption in the regulation of myeloid cell lineage, such as neutrophils (19Selvatici R. Falzarano S. Mollica A. Spisani S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 534: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We (20Kim M.K. Min do S. Park Y.J. Kim J.H. Ryu S.H. Bae Y.S. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1917-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and Viswanathan et al. (21Viswanathan A. Painter R.G. Lanson Jr., N.A. Wang G. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have recently reported on the expression of functional FPR in human bone marrow-derived MSCs, which has been suggested as playing potential roles in mediation of adhesion and migration of stem cells to sites of injury for tissue repair. However, it is unknown whether FPR1 and its ligand, fMLP, regulate differentiation of MSCs. Thus, this study was undertaken in an effort to determine whether fMLP influences human MSC commitment along osteoblastic and adipocytic lineages. Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, trypsin-EDTA, and antibiotic/antimycotic solution were purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-FPR1, anti-FPR2, and anti-FPR3 mouse monoclonal antibodies and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Isotype mouse IgG was used as a negative control antibody. Anti-PLCβ1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Previously described procedures were used for generation of the polyclonal anti-PLD antibody that recognizes both PLD1 and PLD2 (22Min D.S. Kwon T.K. Park W.S. Chang J.S. Park S.K. Ahn B.H. Ryoo Z.Y.

The secondary antibody was FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (BD Biosciences). fMLP, cyclosporine H (CysH), and 5-fluoro-2-indolyl des-clorohalopemide hydrochloride hydrate were purchased from Sigma. Pertussis toxin (PTX), U73122, U73343, KN-92, KN-93, and U0126 were purchased from Calbiochem. A 21-nucleotide sequence siRNA corresponding to the human FPR1 sequence (5′-AGAAAUUGGUAUUGCAGUGUU-3′), PLCβ1 (5′-GGAGACGGAGCUGUUAGAU-3′), and PLD1 (5′-AAGGUGGGACGACAAUGAGCA-3′) were purchased from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). Antibodies to CREB, phospho-CREB, ERK, or phospho-ERK were purchased from Cell Signaling, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to rabbit IgG were purchased from Kirkegaard & Perry, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Human (h) MSCs were purchased from Cambrex BioScience (Walkersville, MD) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (low glucose) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). hMSCs were used for the experiments until six passages. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. hMSCs were cultured to confluence in the growth medium (20% FBS in DMEM). Osteoblastic differentiation was induced by exposure of confluent hMSCs to osteogenic medium (10% FBS, 0.1 μm dexamethasone, 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and 50 μm ascorbic acid in α-minimum essential medium), and extracellular matrix calcification was visualized by Alizarin Red-S staining. Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 95% ethanol at 4 °C for 30 min. Fixed cells were incubated with 4% Alizarin Red-S (Sigma) for 15 min with shaking. To minimize nonspecific staining, cells were rinsed five times with deionized water and once with PBS for 20 min. Osteoblastic differentiation was quantified by measurement of the area of Alizarin Red staining and photographed using a digital camera equipped with Nikon TS100 inverted microcopy (Nikon, Japan) using 10×/0.25 ph1 ADL or LWD 40×/0.55 ph1 ADL and density using Scion imaging software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Mineralization, an osteogenic marker, was also evaluated by calcein staining for indication of osteoblastic differentiation. For assays, the culture was supplemented with 1 μg/ml of calcein AM (Sigma C1359) during the observation period. An image analyzer (Axiovert 200 M, Zeiss, Germany) with EC PLAN-NEOFLUAR 10×/0.3 ph1 and AxioVision designed especially for fluorescence microscopy was used for visualization of fluorescence of incorporated calcein. MSCs were cultured to confluence in the growth medium and then treated with adipogenic differentiation medium (10% FBS, 0.1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 200 μm, indomethacin). As described previously, accumulation of intracellular triglyceride droplets was visualized by Oil Red O staining (23Novikoff A.B. Novikoff P.M. Rosen O.M. Rubin C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and phase contrast images were photographed using a digital camera equipped with Nikon inverted microcopy (Nikon, Japan) using 10×/0.25 ph1 ADL or LWD 40×/0.55 ph1 ADL. The number of cells committed to the adipogenic lineage was quantified by counting the number of cells having numerous cytoplasmic lipid-filled vacuoles in three randomly selected visual fields in the same well. hMSCs undifferentiated or differentiated into osteoblasts for 12 days were incubated with monoclonal antibody against FPR1, FPR2, or FPR3 for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by washing with FACS buffer (PBS containing 5% FBS, 0.1% sodium azide), and then incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 20 min at 4 °C. Samples were acquired on an FACSCaliburTM flow cytometer, and CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences) was used for data analysis. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride) and analyzed by immunoblot. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used for detection of immunoreactive bands (Amersham Biosciences). MSCs were seeded into 35-mm dishes at 2 × 105 cells per dish and grown for 1 day. Cells were labeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol (3 μCi/ml) in inositol-free DMEM for 24 h. Labeled cells were subsequently washed and pretreated with 20 mm LiCl for 15 min in DMEM containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Stimulation was initiated by addition of fMLP and terminated by addition of ice-cold 5% HClO4. Following incubation of the reaction mixture for 30 min in an ice bath, cell extracts were centrifuged, diluted with distilled water, and applied to a Bio-Rad Dowex AG 1-X8 anion exchange column. The column was initially washed with 10 ml of 60 mm ammonium formate containing 5 mm sodium tetraborate. Total inositol phosphates were eluted with a solution containing 1 mm ammonium formate and 0.1 m formic acid. PLD activity was assessed by measurement of formation of [3H]phosphatidylbutanol, the product of PLD-mediated transphosphatidylation, in the presence of 1-butanol. MSCs in 6-well plates were serum-starved in the presence of 2 μCi of [3H]myristic acid/ml. After overnight starvation, the cells were washed three times with 5 ml of PBS and pre-equilibrated in serum-free DMEM for 1 h. For the final 10 min of preincubation, 0.3% butan-1-ol was incubated. At the end of preincubation, cells were treated with fMLP. Previously described procedures were used for extraction and characterization of lipids by thin layer chromatography (24Min D.S. Ahn B.H. Rhie D.J. Yoon S.H. Hahn S.J. Kim M.S. Jo Y.H. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For measurement of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of the cell layer, cells were rinsed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then incubated with 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 50 mm glycine and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 10.5, at 37 °C for 20 min. Absorbance of p-nitrophenol produced by ALP activity was monitored at 405 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer. MSCs were plated in 12-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well and grown to 50–60% confluence. Plasmid mixtures containing luciferase reporter plasmids were transfected by Lipofectamine Plus, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following 24 h of transfection, the medium was changed, and cells were treated with inhibitors, as indicated. Cells were lysed, followed by measurement of reporter activity using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega). For transfection efficiency, relative luciferase activity was obtained by normalization of firefly luciferase activity against the Renilla luciferase activity of the internal control. Total RNA was isolated by the TRIzol method (Sigma). First strand cDNA was synthesized using AMV-RTase (Promega, Madison, WI). Real time q-PCR was conducted with cDNA using the Quantitect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) and a Rotor-Gene RG-3000A apparatus (Corbett Research). All data were normalized with GAPDH gene expression values. Oligonucleotide primer sequences were as follows (F, forward primer; R, reverse primer): FPR1-F, 5′-GGCATCATCCGGTTCATCATT-3′, and FPR1-R, 5′-AGGGCACTTGTCACATCCACT-3′; FPR2-F, 5′-GTCGGACCTTGGATTCTTGCT-3′, and FPR2-R, 5′-CTTTTTGTGGATCTTGGCTGCA-3′; FPR3-F, 5′-CGCACAGTCAACACCATCTG-3′, and FPR-R, 5′-AGCTGTTAAAAAAGGCCAAG-3′; GAPDH-F, 5′-GTGGTCTCCTCTGACTTCAAC-3′, and GAPDH-R, 5′-TCTCTTCCTCTTGTGCTCTTG-3′; Runx2-F, 5′-CCAGATGGGACTGTGGTTACC-3′, and Runx2-R, 5′-ACTTGGTGCAGAGTTCAGGG-3′; PPARγ-F, 5′-TCTCTCCGTAATGGAAGACC-3′, and PPARγ-R, 5′-GCATTATGAGACATCCCCAC-3′; and Zebrafish RUNX2-F, 5′-CTCAGTGAACTGGAGCGCAT-3′, and Zebrafish RUNX2-R, 5′-AGTGAGGAGAAGGCAGGGAA-3′. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were collected from spontaneous spawnings of the AB line and reared at 28.5 °C. Three days postfertilization (∼1 day after hatching), feeding of the commercial powder for baby fish was started. Zebrafish embryos were stimulated with fMLP from 8 to 48 h postfertilization (hpf), washed, and raised at 28.5 °C. At 5 days postfertilization (dpf), 20 zebrafish were stained with Alizarin Red for examination of the effect of fMLP on bone formation. Zebrafish were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12–18 h. Following fixation, fish were depigmented overnight in 1% KOH containing 3% H2O2 and immersed for 2 h in 0.5% KOH containing 0.05% Alizarin Red, pH 4.2. Alizarin-stained fish were then cleared again in 1% KOH and observed under a microscope. Four rabbits were used for this experiment. After preliminary breeding, they were divided into two groups according to the design of the experiment; control and 4 weeks. Rabbits were in good health prior to the experiment and were bred in an excluded environment. All animal experiments were approved by the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Wonkwang University. Rabbits were subjected to general anesthesia by intramuscular injections with 0.2 ml/kg of xylazine HCl (Rompun®, Bayer in Korea) and 0.3 ml/kg of ketamine HCl (Ketalar®, Yuhan Co., Korea). Lidocaine containing epinephrine was administered subcutaneously for local anesthesia. Full thickness flap was performed for exposure of the cranium and a trephine bur with a diameter of 4.8 mm was used to make bony defects. For improvement of manipulation, fMLP was added to hyaluronic acid gel as a carrier. Fifty μm of fMLP was administered with hyaluronic acid for the experimental group, and hyaluronic acid was added only to the control group. The total volume administered to each defect was 10 μl. At 4 weeks post-surgery, animals were induced by general anesthesia and sacrificed with CO2 inhalation for histological examination. After dyeing with Masson trichrome, sections were observed under a microscope. Peak-Pro software (BaromKorea, Korea) was used for quantification of bone formation. Bone gain was quantified by a relative percentage of regenerated bone compared with the area of surgically created bone defect under ×20 magnification. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. of the number of determinations indicated. Statistical significance of differences was determined by analysis of variance. Significance was accepted with p < 0.05. To determine whether expression of FPR family members is regulated during osteoblastic differentiation, hMSCs were differentiated into osteoblasts, and an analysis of FPR expression was performed. As shown in Fig. 1A, expression of FPR1, but not FPR2 and FPR3, was significantly increased in a time-dependent manner during osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs, as analyzed by q-PCR. Expression of Runx-2, a major transcription factor in osteoblast differentiation, also increased during the indicated time course of osteoblast differentiation. To further examine the protein level of FPR family members during osteoblast differentiation, we performed immunostaining of MSCs followed by flow cytometric analyses. Without permeabilization, the cells were immunostained with monoclonal antibodies against FPR1, FPR2, or FPR3. In immunostaining of undifferentiated cells, mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for FPR1 was 49.02, whereas MFI for FPR2 and FPR3 were 5.17 and 4.88, respectively (Fig. 1B). However, immunostaining of the isotype antibody resulted in background staining with a MFI of 2.26. In MSCs differentiated into osteoblasts for 12 days, MFI for FPR1 was 99.17, whereas MFI for FPR2 and FPR3 were 14.44 and 13.68, respectively. Immunostaining of the isotype antibody resulted in background staining with an MFI of 5.67 (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the expression level of FPR1 protein, but not those of FPR2 and FPR3, is significantly increased during osteoblastic differentiation, suggesting that FPR1 may play a role in osteoblast differentiation. In the FPR signaling pathway, binding of fMLP, a specific ligand of FPR1, to FPR1 leads to a number of downstream cellular events, including activation of PLC and PLD (19Selvatici R. Falzarano S. Mollica A. Spisani S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 534: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To determine whether FPR in MSCs is a functional response to fMLP stimulation during osteogenic differentiation, we measured the activities of PLC and PLD before or after osteoblastic differentiation. Cells were labeled with [3H]inositol or [3H]myristic acid and stimulated with 1 μm fMLP. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, fMLP induced an increase in formation of inositol phosphates and phosphatidylbutanol in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells. In differentiated cells, both basal and fMLP-stimulated PLC or PLD activity showed a significant increase, compared with undifferentiated cells. In addition, fMLP-induced PLC or PLD activation was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with CysH, a potent and selective FPR1 antagonist (25Wenzel-Seifert K. Grünbaum L. Seifert R. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1940-1946PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4591-4599PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that expression of functional FPR, particularly FPR1, is significantly increased during osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. To investigate the question of whether fMLP affects osteoblastic differentiation, osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs was induced by exposure of cells to OM in the presence of different concentrations of fMLP. As shown in Fig. 2A (left panel), continuous treatment with fMLP resulted in a dose-dependent increase of mineralization, which was induced by osteoblastic differentiation for 14 days, as visualized by Alizarin Red-S staining. However, fMLP itself at various concentrations did not induce extracellular mineralization of MSCs in cultures maintained in growth medium (GM). Fig. 2A, right panel, shows the quantitation of Alizarin Red-S staining. For determination of whether continuous treatment of MSCs with fMLP is essential for osteoblastic differentiation, cells were pulse-chased with 1 μm fMLP in OM for 3 days and washed; cells were then cultured in the absence of fMLP during the indicated time course of osteogenesis. Pulse treatment of MSCs with fMLP resulted in a significant increase of mineral deposition, compared with that of MSCs cultured in OM in the absence of fMLP (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that exposure of MSCs to fMLP during early stages of differentiation is essential for fMLP-stimulated osteoblastic differentiation. To further examine the question of whether fMLP stimulates osteoblast differentiation of MSCs, cells were cultured in OM containing calcein for 14 days, and mineralization was detected by the calcein assay. Fluorescent spots, indicative of calcein uptake into newly mineralized extracellular matrix, showed a significant increase upon application of 1 μm fMLP to the cell culture (supplemental Fig. 1A). However, fMLP-stimulated mineralization was suppressed by pretreatment with CysH, suggesting selective mediation of fMLP-stimulated osteoblast differentiation of MSCs via FPR1. Because activity of ALP, an early marker of osteoblastic differentiation, plays an important role in both osteoblastic differentiation and eventual mineralization processes, we next measured ALP activity in these cells. ALP activity in MSCs increased by exposure to OM for 5 days, and treatment of cells with 1 μm fMLP resulted in further promotion of ALP activity (Fig. 2C). However, fMLP-stimulated ALP activity was inhibited by pretreatment with CysH. fMLP-stimulated ALP activity is consistent with increased mineralization in fMLP-treated cells during osteoblastic differentiation (Fig. 2C). We attempted to further determine whether fMLP-stimulated osteogenesis is mediated via FPR1. Analysis by Alizarin Red-S staining and the ALP assay showed that knockdown of FPR1 using siRNA resulted in a marked reduction of fMLP-stimulated osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs (Fig. 2D). Expression of FPR1 by transfection with siRNA for FPR1 was analyzed by q-PCR (Fig. 2D). In addition, quantitation of Alizarin Red-S staining was performed (Fig. 2D). Gene silencing of FPR1 also inhibited osteogenesis at the basal level, compared with control siRNA. These data suggest an important role for FPR1 in osteogenesis. The N-terminal fragment of annexin-1, Anx-1(2–26), is an endogenous host-derived agonist of FPR1 (27La M. D'Amico M. Bandiera S. Di Filippo C. Oliani S.M. Gavins F.N. Flower R.J. Perretti M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of annexin-1 on osteogenesis of MSCs. Alizarin Red-S staining and the ALP assay showed that Anx-1(2–26) significantly promoted osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs in the presence of OM (Fig. 2E), and Anex-1-stimulated osteogenesis was suppressed by pretreatment with CysH. Anex-1 alone did not affect osteoblastic differentiation in the presence of GM (data not shown). In addition, we observed that knockdown of FPR1 inhibited expression of Runx2 under OM-induced conditions, as analyzed by q-PCR (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these results suggest that promotion of osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs in response to fMLP is selectively mediated via FPR1. Osteoblast differentiation of MSCs occurs along with an increase in expression of Runx2, a master transcription factor in osteogenesis. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is an important inducer of osteoblastic differentiation in bone biology (28Zhang X. Schwarz E.M. Young D.A. Puzas J.E. Rosier R.N. O'Keefe R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1405-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). To further confirm the pro-osteogenic effect of fMLP, we examined expression of osteoblast marker genes. Expression levels of Runx2 and COX2 increased after exposure of MSCs to OM for 14 days (Fig. 3A). Compared with nontreated cells, treatment of cells with OM along with fMLP promoted an increase in expression levels of Runx2 and COX2 (Fig. 3A). In the presence of GM, fMLP alone did not induce an increase in the expression levels of osteogenic markers in MSCs (data not shown). To further examine fMLP-stimulated expression of osteomarker genes, MSCs were transfected with promoters of osteogenic marker genes and treated with fMLP. fMLP induced a significant increase in the promoter activities of Runx2, ALP, osteocalcin, and bone sialoprotein (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with the observation that fMLP stimulates extracellular mineralization of MSCs exposed to OM, suggesting that fMLP promotes osteoblastic differentiation through increase of the expression levels of osteogenic markers. Osteoblasts and adipocytes are differentiated from bone marrow-derived MSCs, and reciprocal regulation of their differentiation occurs through mechanisms that are largely unknown. To explore the question of whether fMLP affects differentiation"
https://openalex.org/W1976040579,"Identifying the location and size of residual foci of infections is critical where malaria elimination is the primary goal. Here the spatial heterogeneity of Plasmodium falciparum infections within the urban extent of Khartoum state in Sudan is investigated using data from cross-sectional surveys undertaken from 1999 to 2008 to inform the Khartoum Malaria Free Initiative (KMFI).From 1999-2008 the KMFI undertook cross-sectional surveys of 256 clusters across 203 random samples of residential blocks in the urban Khartoum state in September of each year. Within sampled blocks, at least five persons, including at least one child under the age of five years, were selected from each household. Blood smears were collected from the sampled individuals to examine the presence of P. falciparum parasites. Residential blocks were mapped. Data were analysed for spatial clustering using the Bernoulli model and the significance of clusters were tested using the Kulldorff scan statistic.A total of 128,510 malaria slide examinations were undertaken during the study period. In 1999, overall prevalence was 2.5%, rising to 3.2% in 2000 and consistently staying below 1% in subsequent years. From 2006, over 90% of all surveyed clusters reported no infections. Spatial clustering of infections was present in each year but not statistically significant in the years 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2008. Spatial clusters of high infection were often located at the junction of the Blue and White Niles.Persisting foci of malaria infection in Khartoum are likely to distort wide area assessments and disproportionately affect future transmission within the city limits. Improved investments in surveillance that combines both passive and active case detection linked to a geographic information system and a more detailed analysis of the location and stability of foci should be undertaken to facilitate and track malaria elimination in the state of Khartoum."

Clinical resistance to antifolates has been mainly attributed to mutations that alter structure or expression of enzymes involved in de novo folate synthesis. We identified a Mycobacterium smegmatis mutant, named FUEL (which stands for folate utilization enzyme for leucovorin), that is hypersusceptible to antifolates. Chemical complementation indicated that FUEL is unable to metabolize folinic acid (also known as leucovorin or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate), whose metabolic function remains unknown. Targeted mutagenesis, genetic complementation, and biochemical studies showed that FUEL lacks 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate synthase (MTHFS; also called 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo-ligase; EC 6.3.3.2) activity responsible for the only ATP-dependent, irreversible conversion of folinic acid to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate. In trans expression of active MTHFS proteins from bacteria or human restored both antifolate resistance and folinic acid utilization to FUEL. Absence of MTHFS resulted in marked cellular accumulation of polyglutamylated species of folinic acid. Importantly, MTHFS also affected M. smegmatis utilization of monoglutamylated 5-methyltetrahydrofolate exogenously added to the medium. Likewise, Escherichia coli mutants lacking MTHFS became susceptible to antifolates. These results indicate that folinic acid conversion by MTHFS is required for bacterial intrinsic antifolate resistance and folate homeostatic control. This novel mechanism of antimicrobial antifolate resistance might be targeted to sensitize bacterial pathogens to classical antifolates.

This novel mechanism of antimicrobial antifolate resistance might be targeted to sensitize bacterial pathogens to classical antifolates. The challenge of bacterial antibiotic resistance has traditionally been approached in two ways: discovery of brand new antibiotics and use of semisynthetic derivatives of known antibiotics to circumvent existing resistance mechanisms (1Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: R127-R132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). An alternative strategy to these two pathways is to develop inhibitors of resistance mechanisms (1Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: R127-R132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this approach, an antibiotic is co-administered with a “potentiator” that neutralizes the targeted resistance mechanism, thereby resensitizing the resistant organisms to the accompanied antibiotic. An example of this strategy is coadministration of a β-lactam with a β-lactamase inhibitor. This approach has the advantage of extending the utility of antibiotics of known pharmacology, toxicology, and treatment schedule (1Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: R127-R132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 2Wright G.D. Sutherland A.D. Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 260-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Insight into molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance could reveal novel strategies for such potentiation approaches. Because of the vital role of folates in multiple metabolic processes of the cell, folate antagonism has been used successfully in chemotherapeutic treatment of multiple diseases including cancers, malaria, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, graft-versus-host disease, and bacterial infections (3Gorlick R. Goker E. Trippett T. Waltham M. Banerjee D. Bertino J.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 4.Bertino, J. R., (ed) (1971) Folate Antagonists as Chemotherapeutic Agents, New York Academy of Sciences, New York.Google Scholar). Folate antagonists (or antifolates) have been used extensively for the treatment of infectious diseases from the late 1930s to the 1960s, but their use has declined because of the emergence of resistant strains, cytotoxicity, and most importantly the introduction of more effective drugs (4.Bertino, J. R., (ed) (1971) Folate Antagonists as Chemotherapeutic Agents, New York Academy of Sciences, New York.Google Scholar, 5Libecco J.A. Powell K.R. Pediatr. Rev. 2004; 25: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, combination therapies using trimethoprim and sulfonamides to create synergistic effects are still used effectively today to treat some infectious diseases such as urinary tract infection, shigellosis, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and prophylaxis against recurrent and drug-resistant infections (5Libecco J.A.

The absence of enzymes required for complete de novo folate biosynthesis in humans and other mammals makes this pathway an attractive and potential target for antibiotic development (8Bermingham A. Derrick J.P. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Whereas enzymatic activities involved in folate metabolism are rather well known, the current antimicrobial antifolates exclusively target two steps in the folate biosynthetic pathway (8Bermingham A. Derrick J.P. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 9Gangjee A. Jain H.D. Kurup S. Anticancer Agents Med.

Recent studies suggesting that antifolate combinations such as co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole) might be effective against tuberculosis (TB) have renewed interests in the exploitation of antifolates to treat multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB (11Young L.S.

Importantly, the World Health Organization has officially called for the widespread use of this drug combination for the prophylactic treatment of HIV patients (14Date A.A. Vitoria M. Granich R. Banda M. Fox M.Y. Gilks C. Bull. World Health Organ. 2010; 88: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which raises the possibility of increased resistance backgrounds of bacterial pathogens to classical antifolates (14Date A.A.

Inhibition of mechanisms governing intrinsic antifolate resistance could help to sensitize pathogenic bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis to classical antifolates and thus allow expanding the use of these already available antibiotics. para-aminobenzoic acid 5-formyltetrahydrofolate or folinic acid 5-methyltetrahydrofolate 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate dihydrofolate synthase liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate synthase folic acid (or pteroylmonoglutamic acid) sulfachloropyridazine tuberculosis tetrahydrofolate folate utilization enzyme for leucovorin nutrient extract minimum inhibitory concentration M. smegmatis MTHFS. Here, we report the identification of a novel determinant of intrinsic antifolate resistance that exists in two bacterial species of distantly related phyla, Mycobacterium smegmatis of Gram-positive Actinobacteria and Escherichia coli of Gram-negative Proteobacteria. This mechanism thus provides a potential target for antifolate potentiation. All chemicals were of the highest available quality. Unless otherwise stated, chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Difco media and components were obtained from Fisher Scientific. 5-Formyltetrahydrofolate racemates (6R,6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlun (n = 1–6), (6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu1, and other folate species used as standards for analytical methods were purchased from Schirck's Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Restriction enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA) or Qiagen (Valencia, CA). E. coli strains AG1 (recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17(rk− mk+) supE44 relA1) and BW25113 (rrnB DElacZ4787 HsdR514 DE(araBAD)567 DE(rhaBAD)568 rph-1) and the derived ΔygfA mutant were obtained from the National BioResource Project (National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka, Japan). E. coli ArcticExpress (DE3)RP strain was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Other bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. Oligo primers were synthesized by Eurofins MWG Operon (Huntsville, AL) and are listed in supplemental Table S2. Luria broth agar was used for maintenance and propagation of E. coli; Middlebrook 7H10 or the complex NE medium (16Nguyen L. Chinnapapagari S. Thompson C.J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6603-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was used for mycobacteria. The pMycoMar vector that carries a Himar1 transposon was used to construct a mutant library (16Nguyen L. Chinnapapagari S. Thompson C.J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6603-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Rubin E.J. Akerley B.J. Novik V.N. Lampe D.J. Husson R.N. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1645-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Wild-type M. smegmatis mc2155 was transformed with pMycoMar vector. Transformed bacteria were cultivated at 28 °C overnight to recover and allow multiplication before plating on LB agar plates containing 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin. After incubation for 5 days at 39 °C, single colonies were picked and cultured separately in 96-well plates in 7H9 medium and 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin for 2 days. These plates were used as “master plates” to replicate to plates of solid NE medium (16Nguyen L. Chinnapapagari S. Thompson C.J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6603-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) containing serial concentrations of sulfachloropyridazine (10, 15, 20, 25, and 50 μg ml−1) or trimethoprim (1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 μg ml−1). Five wells at different positions of 96-well plates inoculated with wild-type M. smegmatis strain mc2155 were used as growth controls. Colonies that grew on NE-kanamycin plates but failed to grow on plates supplemented with antifolates were subjected to two rounds of additional replication to confirm drug susceptibility patterns. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of selected mutants to antifolates were determined by serial dilution assays (see below). Mapping of transposon insertion sites in the mutants by using an arbitrary PCR method was carried out as described previously (16Nguyen L. Chinnapapagari S. Thompson C.J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6603-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18Wolff K.A. Nguyen H.T. Cartabuke R.H. Singh A. Ogwang S. Nguyen L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 3515-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The chromosomal gene encoding E. coli MTHFS homolog (ygfA, EG11158) was deleted using a one-step phage λ-Red-based recombineering method (19Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar, 20Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Briefly, primers (YgfA-del1 and YgfA-del2; supplemental Table S2) carrying extensions that are homologous to the flanking DNA regions of ygfA were used to amplify the kanamycin resistance cassette in pKD13 vector (supplemental Table S1). PCR products were gel-purified and directly electroporated to E. coli TB10 cells (MG1655, nadA::Tn10 λcI857 Δ(cro-bioA)) (21Johnson J.E. Lackner L.L. Hale C.A. de Boer P.A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2418-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that had been heat-induced to express the λ-Red system (19Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar, 20Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with kanamycin (25 μg ml−1). Homologous recombination was verified by PCR using primers annealing to chromosomal regions outside the homologous sequences (YgfA1.NE and YgfA2.BH; supplemental Table S2). The ΔygfA mutation locus was transferred to the wild-type strain MG1655 by P1 phage-mediated transduction as described previously (21Johnson J.E. Lackner L.L. Hale C.A. de Boer P.A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2418-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The entire open reading frame of M. smegmatis msmeg_5472 was deleted using the recombineering method as described previously (18Wolff K.A. Nguyen H.T. Cartabuke R.H. Singh A. Ogwang S. Nguyen L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 3515-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The 616-bp DNA region upstream of msmeg_5472 was PCR-amplified using primers fuel-Del1 and fuel-Del2 (supplemental Table S2). Similarly, the 492-bp downstream region was amplified using primers fuel-Del3 and fuel-Del4. These DNA arms were cloned into pYUB854 (22Braunstein M. Bardarov S.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 358: 67-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) flanking the built-in hygromycin cassette to create pVN842. The Δmsmeg5472::Ωhyg linear allelic exchange substrate was removed from pVN842 by SpeI/KpnI digestion and used to transform M. smegmatis mc2155 cells induced to express the recombineering system from pVN701B (18Wolff K.A. Nguyen H.T. Cartabuke R.H. Singh A. Ogwang S. Nguyen L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 3515-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Plasmid pVN701B was later removed from Δmsmeg5472 mutant as described previously (18Wolff K.A. Nguyen H.T. Cartabuke R.H. Singh A. Ogwang S. Nguyen L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 3515-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The 1223-bp DNA fragment including msmeg_5472 ORF and its 605-bp upstream region (PFUEL) was PCR-amplified from M. smegmatis genomic DNA using primers 5472p1.Xb and 5472p2.BH (supplemental Table S2). PCR products were ligated to pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and the nucleotide sequence was verified by sequencing. DNA fragments were then excised with SpeI and HindIII and cloned into pMS2 (supplemental Table S1) cut with XbaI/HindIII to create pVN794. For expression of the human (Homo sapiens) MTHFS in M. smegmatis, its cDNA sequence (National Center for Biotechnology Information, NM_006441) (23Dayan A. Bertrand R. Beauchemin M. Chahla D. Mamo A. Filion M. Skup D. Massie B. Jolivet J. Gene. 1995; 165: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was optimized for codon usage in M. smegmatis (supplemental Table S3) and chemically synthesized (GenScript). The synthesized DNA was cloned into pVN805 (NdeI/HindIII) to couple its expression to the PFUEL. Plasmids pVN794 and pVN808 [pVN805:mthfs] were transformed into M. smegmatis transposon mutants by electroporation, and transformants were selected on LB agar plates containing both kanamycin and hygromycin. For expressing M. tuberculosis rv0992c in M. smegmatis Δmsmeg_5472 null mutant (HygR), the OriE-HygR fragment in plasmid pVN813 [pVN805:rv0992c] was removed (XbaI/NotI) and replaced by the KanR-OriE from pMV361 (XbaI/NotI) to create plasmid pVN879 (KanR). For expressing other MTHFS genes in Δmsmeg_5472, the genes were cloned to pVN871 [integrative vector, KanR, PFUEL] to create pVN888 [pVN871:msmeg_5472] and pVN886 [pVN871:mthfs] (supplemental Table S1) by NdeI/HindIII ligations. Transformants were selected for resistance to kanamycin plus hygromycin. The mutated allele mthfs(D154A) was made using the primers mthfsD154Af and mthfsD154Ar in combination with mthfs1.NE and mthfs2.BH in a two-round PCR protocol (16Nguyen L. Chinnapapagari S. Thompson C.J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6603-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and plasmid pVN808 as a template. This procedure changed the GAC (aspartic acid) codon to GCC (alanine), corresponding to amino acid 154. The mutated gene was cloned to pVN805 and pVN871 (NdeI/HindIII) to create pVN811 and pVN887, respectively (supplemental Table S1). These plasmids were transformed, respectively, to FUEL and Δmsmeg_5472 as described above. For expression in E. coli host, the genes encoding MTHFS homologs were excised from pVN778, pVN786, and pVN793 (supplemental Table S1) by NdeI/BamHI digestions and cloned to vector pET15b (Novagen) cut with the same restriction enzymes. The constructed plasmids (pVN795, pVN814, pVN815, and pVN816; supplemental Table S1) were used to transform the E. coli strain ArcticExpress (DE3)RP (Stratagene) expressing the cold-adapted chaperonins Cpn10 and Cpn60 from the psychrophilic bacterium Oleispira antarctica to facilitate protein folding at reduced temperatures. For strain and plasmid maintenance, ArcticExpress (DE3)RP cultures expressing MTHFS proteins were grown in LB medium in the presence of ampicillin (100 μg ml−1) plus tetracycline (34 μg ml−1) and gentamycin (20 μg ml−1). Overnight cultures (37 °C at 200 rpm) were diluted 50× in LB without antibiotic and grown at 30 °C with shaking (250 rpm) for about 3 h. Exponentially growing cultures (A600 nm ∼0.5) were shifted to 10 °C, and protein production was induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1–1 mm). To stabilize the overproduced enzyme, 0.1 mm (6R,6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu1 was added to the medium at the same time. The induced cultures were incubated at 10 °C for 24–48 h on an orbital table. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. Next, the frozen cells were washed twice with TBS buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), resuspended in 110 volume of TBS buffer, and disrupted by sonication (four times for 20 s with 1-min intervals). The protein concentration in the total cell lysate was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor (Sorvall) for 15 min to yield soluble fraction. Expression of MTHFS proteins and their solubility were assessed by SDS-PAGE through a 10% acrylamide gel followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The soluble fraction was further diluted with buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole) and loaded to a cobalt metal affinity spin column (Pierce) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed three times with 2 column volumes of buffer A followed by elution by 3 volumes of the same buffer A supplemented with a higher concentration of imidazole (150 mm). Protein purity was demonstrated by a single band on SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing purified protein were pooled, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 80 was added, and fractions were stored at 4 or −20 °C for further studies. Cultures of M. smegmatis strains were grown until midlog phase and normalized to A600 nm of 1. Aliquots (50 μl) of the cultures were cast in soft agar (0.5%) and placed on top of NE medium plates supplemented with or without 0.3 mm pABA or a folate derivative. Paper discs embedded with 0.25 or 1 mg of sulfachloropyridazine (BD Diagnostic Systems) were placed at the center of the plates. Growth inhibition was visualized as the inhibition zones surrounding the antibiotic disc after 5 days of incubation at 37 °C. A successful complementation was regarded as the disappearance of the inhibition zones. Sample preparation was handled under subdued light to minimize folate degradation. M. smegmatis cultures growing in 7H9-glucose medium were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in extraction buffer (−75 °C) containing 80% methanol, 0.1% ascorbic acid, and 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.2). 100 μl of 0.01 mm 5-[13C]CHO-H4PteGlu1 was added to the suspension to serve as an internal standard. Aliquots of identical cultures were also harvested for determination of total protein and wet weight. Cells were disrupted by sonication (9 × 20 s) with 1-min intervals. Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation and filtered through 0.45-μm filters. The extracts were dried under N2 gas and resuspended in liquid chromatography starting mobile phase solvent that consisted of 95% eluent A (0.1% of formic acid in water) and 5% eluent B (0.1% of formic acid in acetonitrile). Protein was precipitated by centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) as described previously (24De Brouwer V.

Conditions for HPLC and mass spectrometric analyses using a 4000Q-trap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), preparation of calibrators, and data analyses were carried out as before (24De Brouwer V.

The assay mixture contained, in 1 ml, 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.0), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ATP, and 100 μm (6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlun. Reactions were conducted in quartz cuvettes of 0.5-cm optical path and were initiated by the addition of MTHFS sources. The absorbance was recorded using an Evolution-300 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with VisionLife software. The temperature was maintained at 30 °C by the air-cooled Peltier SPG-1A (Thermo Scientific). One unit of activity corresponds to 1 μmol of 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlun formed in 1 min. Specific activity is expressed as units mg−1 of protein. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. Antifolates were prepared from stocks (50 mg ml−1). Serial 2× dilutions of sulfonamides or trimethoprim (1–1024 μg ml−1) were prepared in 100-μl volumes of a liquid medium (Mueller Hinton broth for E. coli and Middlebrook 7H9 plus glucose and Tween 80 for M. smegmatis) in 96-well, U-bottom microplates. For trimethoprim/sulfonamides combinations (0.039–20 μg ml−1), the two drugs were mixed in a 1:19 ratio. An E. coli strain with known MIC values (ATCC 25922; Ref. 27Fass R.J. Barnishan J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1979; 16: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was used as an internal control. Single colonies from strains were grown to exponential phase, and optical density was adjusted to 0.12 on the MicroScan turbidity meter (28Waites K.B. Brookings E.S. Moser S.A. Zimmer B.L. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1998; 36: 2052-2056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is equivalent to the McFarland standard of 0.5 (29Washington 2nd, J.A. Warren E. Karlson A.G. Appl. Microbiol. 1972; 24: 1013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, the culture suspensions were diluted 25 times with phosphate-buffered saline, and 5-μl aliquots were used to inoculate each well of the prepared 96-well plates using a multiwell inoculator. This procedure produced ∼5 × 105 cfu/well (30Klopman G. Wang S. Jacobs M.R. Bajaksouzian S. Edmonds K. Ellner J.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 1799-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) as assayed by colony counts of the inoculum immediately after inoculation. The inoculated plates were sealed and incubated at 37 °C for 18 (E. coli) or 72 h (M. smegmatis) under static conditions. Growth was assessed with indirect light using a reading mirror (Dynatec Laboratories). MIC was defined as the lowest drug concentration that inhibited at least 80% of growth as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (31National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards M24-A. 23.

We used a chemogenomic profiling approach to screen for whole-genome antifolate resistance determinants in mycobacterial species. A transposon mutant library, currently composed of ∼15,000 individual mutants of M. smegmatis deposited in separate wells of 96-well plates, was constructed using the Himar1 minitransposon system originally isolated from the horn fly Hematobia irritans (17Rubin E.J.

Screening this library, we identified several mycobacterial determinants of intrinsic antifolate resistance. The mutants were further screened for restoration of antifolate resistance by exogenous reagents of the folate pathways to elucidate whether and how their antifolate susceptibility relates to folate starvation. 5S.

One of the mutants identified in this screen was of special interest as it displayed a dramatically increased susceptibility to multiple antifolate drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2052501258,"Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) induces cell death in chondrocytes in a nitric oxide (NO)- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner. In this study, increased production of lactate was observed in IL-1β-treated mouse chondrocytic ATDC5 cells prior to the onset of their death. IL-1β-induced cell death in ATDC5 cells was suppressed by introducing an siRNA for monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT-1), a lactate transporter distributed in plasma and mitochondrial inner membranes. Mct-1 knockdown also prevented IL-1β-induced expression of phagocyte-type NADPH oxidase (NOX-2), an enzyme specialized for production of ROS, whereas it did not have an effect on inducible NO synthase. Suppression of IL-1β-induced cell death by Nox-2 siRNA indicated that NOX-2 is involved in cell death. Phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of κBα (IκBα) from 5 to 20 min after the addition of IL-1β was not affected by Mct-1 siRNA. In addition, IκBα was slightly decreased after 12 h of incubation with IL-1β, and the decrease was prominent after 36 h, whereas activation of p65/RelA was observed from 12 to 48 h after exposure to IL-1β. These changes were not seen in Mct-1-silenced cells. Forced expression of IκBα super repressor as well as treatment with the IκB kinase inhibitor BAY 11-7082 suppressed NOX-2 expression. Furthermore, Mct-1 siRNA lowered the level of ROS generated after 15-h exposure to IL-1β, whereas a ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine, suppressed both late phase degradation of IκBα and Nox-2 expression. These results suggest that MCT-1 contributes to NOX-2 expression via late phase activation of NF-κB in a ROS-dependent manner in ATDC5 cells exposed to IL-1β.

Degeneration of articular cartilage is commonly observed in the pathogenesis of joint diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. One of the most prominent changes in cartilage affected by these diseases is loss of extracellular matrix due to its elevated degradation and lowered synthesis (1Goldring M.B. Marcu K.B. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2009; 11: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), whereas reduced cellularity in cartilage is another feature (2Kim H.A. Blanco F.J. Curr.

It is known that proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), produced by synovial cells and chondrocytes, play pivotal roles in the progression of these degenerative changes, in part by stimulating the production of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesNOXNADPH oxidaseMCTmonocarboxylate transporterDCFH-DA2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetateαCHCα-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamatel-NAMENω-nitro-l-arginine methyl esterMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromideMTS3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner saltNACN-acetyl-l-cysteineIKKIκB kinase. in an autocrine/paracrine mechanism.

In our previous study, we demonstrated that IL-1β induces cell death in rat primary chondrocytes and mouse chondrocytic ATDC5 cells via mitochondrial dysfunction in a nitric oxide (NO)- and ROS-dependent manner (7Yasuhara R. Miyamoto Y. Akaike T. Akuta T. Nakamura M. Takami M. Morimura N. Yasu K. Kamijo R. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of the inducible type of NO synthase (NOS-2), a characteristic of chondrocytes (8Maier R. Bilbe G. Rediske J. Lotz M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), was induced by IL-1β within a few h in these cells. Formation of peroxynitrite, a reaction product of NO and superoxide (O2̇̄), was reported to be one of the executioners of cell death (5Del Carlo Jr., M. Loeser R.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 6Whiteman M. Armstrong J.S. Cheung N.S. Siau J.L. Rose P. Schantz J.T. Jones D.P. Halliwell B.

J. 2005; 389: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which indicates the importance of increased production of O2̇̄ in these cells. Several biological systems are known to produce ROS, including O2̇̄, namely, the mitochondrial electron transfer system, the arachidonate cascade, xanthine oxidase, uncoupled NO synthases, and NADPH oxidases (NOXs). Among those, we previously observed the progression of cell death as increments of NOX-2 expression in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes (7Yasuhara R. Miyamoto Y. Akaike T. Akuta T. Nakamura M. Takami M. Morimura N. Yasu K. Kamijo R. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). NOXs are enzymes specialized for generation of O2̇̄ and H2O2, and seven members of the NOX family have been identified thus far, including NOX-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5 and Duox-1 and -2 (9Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar). Among them, NOX-2 is the best characterized and reported to be mainly distributed in phagocytes, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. The function of NOX-2 in these cells is regulated by its activation via assembly of the components of the NOX enzyme system, which are NOX-2, p22phox, p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, and Rac (9Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar). In addition to the antiseptic functions of NOX-2 in these immune cells, attention is increasingly being focused on the diverse biological actions of NOX enzymes in various types of cells (9Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar). Although the expression of NOX enzymes in chondrocytes has not been fully clarified, a NOX-2 homologue and NOX complex have been observed in porcine articular chondrocytes and a human chondrocyte line (10Moulton P.J. Hiran T.S. Goldring M.B. Hancock J.T. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 36: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Henrotin Y.E. Bruckner P. Pujol J.P. Osteoarthr.

Takami M. Morimura N. Yasu K. Kamijo R. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that TNF-α, interferon-γ, and lipopolysaccharide induced the expression of Nox-2 via activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in murine and human phagocytes (12Anrather J. Racchumi G. Iadecola C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5657-5667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 13Gauss K.A. Nelson-Overton L.K. Siemsen D.W. Gao Y. DeLeo F.R. Quinn M.T. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2007; 82: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports regarding the regulatory mechanism of Nox-2 expression in chondrocytes. In the present study, we observed activation of NF-κB in ATDC5 cells after prolonged exposure to IL-1β. Both late phase activation of NF-κB and induction of Nox-2 expression in IL-1β-treated ATDC5 cells were found to be dependent on monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-1, a transmembrane transporter for lactate and pyruvate (14Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). MCTs are distributed in plasma membrane and catalyze transmembrane transport of monocarboxylates. Among the 14 genes identified as MCT isoforms, seven of them have been characterized so far. Because MCT-1, -2, -3, and -4 transport monocarboxylates, such as lactate and pyruvate, with H+, depending on their intra- and extracellular concentrations, they are considered to constitute a part of energy metabolism as well as that of the pH regulatory system. MCT-6 transports diuretics, depending on pH and membrane potential. MCT-10 transports aromatic amino acids, depending on their concentration gradients. It is known that MCT-1, -2, and -4 are distributed not only in plasma membrane but also in mitochondrial inner membrane. Among these MCT isoforms, MCT-1 is ubiquitously expressed and regarded to play an important role in oxidative energy production (14Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). Herein, we describe the role of MCT-1 in NF-κB activation and Nox-2 induction in ATDC5 cells.

In some experiments, ATDC5 cells were precultured for 2 weeks in the presence of ITS (10 μg/ml insulin, 5.5 μg/ml transferrin, 6.7 ng/ml sodium selenite) (Invitrogen) and used as differentiated ATDC5 cells. StealthTM siRNAs for mouse Mct-1, Mct-6, Mct-13, and Nox-2 and their control non-silencing siRNAs were purchased from Invitrogen.

ATDC5 cells were infected with retroviruses generated by BOSC 23 cells that had been transfected with these plasmids, as described previously (19Krebs D.L. Yang Y. Dang M. Haussmann J. Gold M.R. Methods Cell Sci. 1999; 21: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 96-well plates at various densities and then treated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) in complete medium containing 2.5% FCS. Cell viability was assessed using an MTT assay after incubation for 4 h with 0.5 mg/ml MTT. Formed MTT-formazan was solubilized in isopropyl alcohol containing 40 mm HCl and determined by reading absorbance at 562 nm using a microplate reader (SH-1000 Lab, Corona Electric Co., Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan). In some experiments, cells were incubated for 1 h with solution from a CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay kit, and then MTS-formazan was determined by reading absorbance at 490 nm. Cell viability was also evaluated by counting the number of adherent cells. Cells were fixed in 10% formalin-PBS, rinsed in PBS, and stained with 0.05% toluidine blue at pH 7.0 for 30 min. After rinsing in tap water, the number of cells was counted using cell counting software preinstalled in a BZ-9000 microscope (Keyence Co., Osaka, Japan). Cells were cultured for 24 or 48 h in complete medium in the presence (10 ng/ml) or absence of IL-1β. Lactate concentrations in the culture supernatants were determined using an l-lactic acid UV test (R-Biopharm AG, Darmstadt, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated with 10 μm DCFH-DA in the dark for 2 h at 37 °C (20De Clerck L.S. Bridts C.H. Mertens A.M. Moens M.M. Stevens W.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 172: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). They were harvested by collagenase digestion, washed three times with PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and resuspended in Hanks' balanced solution containing 0.2% BSA. ROS-dependent fluorescence of 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein from the cell suspension was determined using a FACSCaliber Flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Total RNA was extracted from the cells using TRIzol® solution (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription reactions were performed using Superscript III (Invitrogen) and a random hexamer. The primers for PCR were designed using Primer3 software (21Rozen S. Skaletsky H.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) based on the sequences of mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Nox-2, and the Mct isoforms, which were synthesized and supplied by Invitrogen. The sequences of the primers used and the amplicon sizes of the genes are as follows: GAPDH, 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′ and 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′ (452 bp); Nox-2, 5′-GAG GGT TTC CAG CCA GCG AAC TTT GGT-3′ and 5′-TGA AGG GGG CCT GTA TGT GG-3′ (349 bp); Mct-1, 5′- GCT GGA GGT CCT ATC AGC AG-3′ and 5′-CGG ACA GCT TTT CTC CTT TG-3′ (502 bp); Mct-2, 5′-TTA CCG TAT CTG GGC CTT TG-3′ and 5′-CCA AAG CAG TTT CGA AGG AG-3′ (462 bp); Mct-3, 5′-ACG GCT GGT TTC ATA ACA GG-3′ and 5′-CCA TTT TTC TCA GGC TCT GC-3′ (530 bp); Mct-4, 5′-CAT CGA AGT GCA AGG AGA CA-3′ and 5′-TTT GAT CAG CAA TCC ATC CA-3′ (414 bp); Mct-6, 5′-CTT TCG CTA CCG AGT TCT GG-3′ and 5′-CCA CGA CGT GAA AAT GTG TC-3′ (461 bp); Mct-7, 5′-CGT CCA CGA ATC CAG TAC CT-3′ and 5′-TGT GCG TTT GAA GCT TTG AC-3′ (491 bp); Mct-8, 5′-GTG CTT TCG TGG TGT ACG TG-3′ and 5′-TCT CAG CCT CCA CAT CCT CT-3′ (773 bp); Mct-9, 5′-ACG GGA GAC TTC CCT TCC TA-3′ and 5′-CAG GAC ACA GAA GCC ACT GA-3′ (676 bp); Mct-10, 5′-CTG CTC CCT TTG CTG TTA GG-3′ and 5′-CTT CAC ACC GGG CAA ATA GT-3′ (426 bp); Mct-12, 5′-TGT CGT TCA GCT CCT CAT TG-3′ and 5′-GGA AGG TTT GAA GCA TTG GA-3′ (545 bp); Mct-13, 5′-GGC CCT CTT GCT AGT GTC TG-3′ and 5′-AGT TCA GGA AGC ACG GAG AA-3′ (486 bp); and Mct-14, 5′-CAC CAA CCG CAT GTT TGT AG-3′ and 5′-CAA AGA TCC ATC CTG CGA AT-3′ (366 bp). The PCR products were separated on a 1.0% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using TaqManTM Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The amplification signals from the target genes were normalized against that of GAPDH. Cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture containing EDTA (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysates (5 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel) under a reducing condition. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies against phospho-IκBα and IκBα, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence reaction with an ECL plus Western blot detection system (GE Healthcare). Nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear extraction kit (Active Motif Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Active p65/RelA in the nuclear extracts was quantitatively analyzed using a TransAMTM NF-κB p65 transcription factor assay kit (Active Motif Inc.), which is an ELISA-based quantification system for p65/RelA bound to κB oligonucleotide. In addition, subcellular localization of p65/RelA was assessed using an immunocytochemical method. Briefly, cells were fixed for 20 min with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature and permeated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Next, the cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml anti-p65/RelA rabbit antibody in PBS containing 10% goat serum, followed by incubation with Alexafluor®-488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) diluted in PBS (1:100) for 45 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was observed using a BZ-9000 microscope. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis, with p < 0.05 considered to be significant. ATDC5 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 96-well plates and then cultured in the presence or absence of IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for up to 72 h. Cell viability was assessed based on the number of adherent cells stained with toluidine blue. Time-dependent cell death was observed after exposure to IL-1β (Fig. 1, A and B). The percentage of living cells after 24 h was 80% of that of the control cells, which decreased gradually over 72 h to 57% of the control (Fig. 1B). Cell viability was also evaluated by an MTT assay, one of the commonly used methods to assess cell proliferation and cell death. MTT assay results are mainly based on the reduction of MTT tetrazolium salt by the mitochondrial electron transfer system (21Rozen S. Skaletsky H.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MTT-reducing activities of cells treated for 12 and 24 h with IL-1β were 1.4- and 1.5-fold greater, respectively, than those of the control cells, which showed that IL-1β increased the MTT-reducing activity of the cells by 55% at 12 h and 75% at 24 h (Fig. 1C). Considering that MTT is mainly reduced by the mitochondrial electron transport system (21Rozen S. Skaletsky H.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is conceivable that IL-1β increased the activity of the mitochondrial electron transfer system within the initial 12 h. However, cell viability evaluated by MTT assays continued to decline with IL-1β treatment after 24 h (Fig. 1C). Together, these results indicate that IL-1β not only suppresses the proliferation of ATDC5 cells but also induces cell death after prolonged incubation for longer than 24 h. To examine the effects of the cell density and differentiation stage on IL-1β-induced cell death, ATDC5 cells maintained in undifferentiated conditions, and those differentiated by 2-week cultures in the presence of ITS were treated with IL-1β. The expressions of mRNAs for typical differentiation markers (i.e. aggrecan, type II collagen, and type X collagen) as well as those for IL-1β and its receptor were assessed by RT-PCR after culturing at various densities for 48 h in the presence or absence of IL-1β (10 ng/ml) (supplemental Fig. S1). Both differentiated ATDC5 cells and those maintained in undifferentiated stage until used for experiments expressed type II collagen mRNA after 48 h of culture in a confluent state, whereas IL-1β suppressed the expressions of type II and type X collagens. In all of the experimental conditions, IL-1β mRNA was hardly detected in ATDC5 cells. On the other hand, the expression of mRNA for IL-1 receptor in the cells in the undifferentiated state was higher than that in the differentiated state, especially at higher cell density. In addition, IL-1β slightly induced the expression of its receptor in undifferentiated cells (supplemental Fig. S1). ATDC5 cells maintained in undifferentiated state and those differentiated by ITS treatment were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 6 × 104 and 6 × 103 cells/well (i.e. nearly confluent and one-tenth confluent, respectively). Next, they were treated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml), and viability was examined by counting the numbers of cells as well as measuring the reduction of MTS, a water-soluble derivative of MTT (15Cory A.H. Owen T.C. Barltrop J.A. Cory J.G. Cancer Commun. 1991; 3: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). In a nearly confluent state (6 × 104 cells/well), both undifferentiated and differentiated ATDC5 cells began to die after incubation for more than 24 h with IL-1β. (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B, top panels). Although formation of MTS formazan in the undifferentiated and differentiated cells increased after 24 h of incubation with IL-1β, it was greater in the undifferentiated ATDC5 cells (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B, bottom panels). As for cells in a one-tenth confluent state (6 × 103 cells/well), the increase in the number of undifferentiated cells was significantly suppressed by IL-1β, whereas such suppression was not significant in the differentiated cells (supplemental Fig. S2, C and D, top panels). Furthermore, MTS reduction was not affected by IL-1β treatment in either undifferentiated or differentiated cells (supplemental Fig. S2, C and D, bottom panels). These results are summarized as follows. IL-1β augmented MTT/MTS reduction, Nox-2 expression, and cell death in ATDC5 cells both in low and high differentiated stages, when they were cultured at high densities. However, the efficacy of IL-1β to induce MTT/MTS reduction and cell death was dependent on cell density and differentiation, with both more prominent in lower differentiated cells in a higher density state. Therefore, we investigated the mechanism of IL-1β-induced cell death in confluent ATDC5 cells that had been maintained in the undifferentiated state before use. Interestingly, IL-1β increased the concentration of lactate in culture supernatants of ATDC5 cells over 24 h (Fig. 2A). It is known that short-chain carboxylates, such as lactate and pyruvate, are transported across the plasma membrane and mitochondrial inner membrane via proton-linked MCTs (23Hashimoto T. Hussien R. Brooks G.A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: E1237-E1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, IL-1β is considered to augment lactate production in ATDC5 cells. Recently, several reports have described the biological significance of lactate and MCTs in mitochondrial production of ROS and inflammatory responses (24Hashimoto T. Hussien R. Oommen S. Gohil K. Brooks G.A. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 2602-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 25Samuvel D.J. Sundararaj K.P. Nareika A. Lopes-Virella M.F. Huang Y. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 2476-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of an MCT inhibitor, αCHC, on IL-1β-induced cell death in ATDC5 cells. αCHC suppressed MTT-formazan formation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, left), possibly due to lowered energy metabolism (21Rozen S. Skaletsky H.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the values obtained in the presence of IL-1β were normalized by those obtained in the absence of the cytokine, αCHC appeared to have a protective effect on ATDC5 cells against IL-1β-induced cell death, which implies possible involvement of MCT subtypes involved in IL-1β-elicited death of ATDC5 cells. Among the 14 known Mct gene subtypes (26Helestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pflügers Arch. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), expressions of mRNAs for Mct-1, -2, -4, -6, -8, -9, -10, -13, and -14 were detected in undifferentiated and differentiated ATDC5 cells in both the presence and absence of IL-1β (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, IL-1β augmented the expression of Mct-1, -9, and -10 and suppressed that of Mct-4 in undifferentiated ATDC5 cells. MCT-1, -2, and -4 are reported to be inhibited by αCHC (27Morris M.E. Felmlee M.A. AAPS J. 2008; 10: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar); thus, MCT-1 is considered to be the most abundant subtype among those susceptible to αCHC, especially in undifferentiated ATDC5 cells treated with IL-1β. Thus, we also investigated the role of MCT-1 in IL-1β-induced gene expression and cell death in ATDC5 cells by introducing siRNA for Mct-1, which nearly completely suppressed the expression of Mct-1 mRNA both in the presence and absence of IL-1β (Fig. 2D). In addition, Mct-1 siRNA significantly suppressed cell death in ATDC5 cells after exposure to IL-1β for 48 h (Fig. 2E). Our previous findings indicated that peroxynitrite, a reaction product of NO and O2̇̄, plays a pivotal role in IL-1β-induced cell death in rat primary chondrocytes as well as ATDC5 cells (7Yasuhara R. Miyamoto Y. Akaike T. Akuta T. Nakamura M. Takami M. Morimura N. Yasu K. Kamijo R. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In those experimental conditions, augmented expressions of NOS-2 and NOX-2 were observed, and their inhibitors suppressed cell death (7Yasuhara R. Miyamoto Y. Akaike T. Akuta T. Nakamura M. Takami M. Morimura N. Yasu K. Kamijo R. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the effects of Mct-1 knockdown on IL-1β-induced expression of mRNAs for Nos-2 and Nox-2. Introduction of Mct-1 siRNA did not have an effect on IL-1β-induced expression of Nos-2 (Fig. 3A), whereas it significantly suppressed that of Nox-2 (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, introduction of siRNAs for other MCT subtypes, such as Mct-6 and Mct-13, did not have a distinct effect on NOX-2 expression or cell death after IL-1β treatment (data not shown). To elucidate the link between suppression of cell death and reduction of Nox-2 expression by Mct-1 knockdown, we also examined the effect of Nox-2 silencing on IL-1β-dependent cell death in ATDC5 cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, cell death was significantly suppressed in cells introduced with the Nox-2 siRNA, thus confirming the involvement of NOX-2 in IL-1β-induced cell death in ATDC5 cells. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, the expression of Nox-2 mRNA was prominent in ATDC5 cells in a lower differentiation stage at higher density as compared with differentiated cells or cells at a lower density. Because undifferentiated ATDC5 cells at higher density tended to die following IL-1β treatment (supplemental Fig. S2), the speculation that NOX-2 plays an important role in IL-1β-induced cell death was reinforced. Lower expression of IL-1 receptor in the differentiated cells might contribute, in part, to the cause of weaker Nox-2 induction in those cells. It was recently reported that NF-κB is involved in transcription"

We report that the Rac2 and the PLD2 isoforms exist in the cell as a lipase-GTPase complex that enables the two proteins to elicit their respective functionalities.

The PLD2-Rac2 association was further confirmed in vitro using affinity-purified recombinant proteins. Binding was saturable with an apparent Kd of 3 nm and was diminished with PLD2-ΔCRIB mutants. Furthermore, PLD2 bound more efficiently to Rac2-GTP than to Rac2-GDP or to a GDP-constitutive Rac2-N17 mutant. Increasing concentrations of recombinant Rac2 in vitro and in vivo during cell adhesion inhibit PLD2. Conversely, Rac2 activity is increased in the presence of PLD2-WT but not in PLD2-ΔCRIB. We propose that in activated cells PLD2 affects Rac2 in an initial positive feedback, but as Rac2-GTP accumulates in the cell, this constitutes a “termination signal” leading to PLD2 inactivation.

Phospholipase D 1 (PLD1) enzymatic activity is regulated through phosphoinositides, PKC, ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), Rho, fatty acids, Ca2+, and protein phosphorylation.

The Rho family of GTPases is also involved in indirect regulation of PLD1 enzymatic activity through stimulation of PI(4,5)P2 kinase, Rho kinase, or by intracellular translocation of the PLD isoforms (9Brown F.D.

In contrast to PLD1, PLD2 is constitutively active, although it can be further activated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). PLD2 localizes to cell membranes where its PH domain binds to PIP2 (13Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr.

PLD2 can also be activated in intact cells by growth factors and agonists (8Du G. Altshuller Y.M. Kim Y. Han J.M. Ryu S.H. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Mol. Biol.

On the other hand, Rac1 does not regulate the activity of the other PLD isoform, PLD2 (13Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr.

The role of Rac2, which is more directly implicated in chemotaxis than Rac1, in the modulation of PLD2 activation, if any, is unknown. Rac is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases that regulate cell growth, transformation, and motility. Rac cycles between a GDP-bound inactive form and a GTP-bound active form. Activation occurs due to GTP exchange factors such as Sos, and inactivation is mediated by the intrinsic GTPase enzymatic activity of Rac2 greatly aided by GTPase activating proteins. Further regulation of the cycle is mediated by guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors that antagonize both GTP exchange factors and GTPase activating proteins (18Beckers C.M. van Hinsbergh V.W. van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. Thromb. Haemost. 2010; 103: 40-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Mohseni M. Chishti A.H. Cell Adh. Migr. 2009; 3: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 20Rivero F.

Sci. 2005; 1: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Rac2 plays an important role in cell migration with activation of membrane ruffling, whereas the other members of the Rho family, like RhoA and Cdc42, mediate stress fibers and filopodia formation, respectively (22Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 23Olivo C. Vanni C. Mancini P. Silengo L. Torrisi M.R. Tarone G. Defilippi P. Eva A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1428-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Once activated, Rho proteins act on substrates or effector molecules and initiate signaling cascades further downstream. The conserved CRIB (for Cdc42-and Rac-interactive binding) motif is the hallmark of an important subset of effectors downstream of Cdc42 and Rac, such as the serine/threonine kinase PAK-1 (p21-activated kinase 1) and the tyrosine kinase ACK-1 (activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1). The CRIB motif forms part of a larger binding domain for Cdc42 and Rac, the “PBD” (p21 binding domain), also called “GBD” (GTPase binding domain), which is essential for the interaction of the PAK-1 and ACK-1 effectors with GTP-bound (but not GDP-bound) Cdc42 or Rac (24Rudolph M.G.

Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The short region was first identified by (26Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a host of candidate Cdc42/Rac effector proteins were identified (27Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) on the basis of sequence homology to this region, and CRIB motif was coined. PAK, ACK, and a third Cdc42 effector, WASP (Wiscott-Aldrich Syndrome protein), are the most well studied CRIB motif-containing proteins and provide an important basis for the understanding of Cdc42/Rac-mediated signaling (28Bi E. Zigmond S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R160-R163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The PLD activity is regulated by small GTPases, whereas PLD also acts upstream to regulate the activities of some small GTPases. PLD1 and PLD2 are dependent on PIP2 for activity (29Du G. Altshuller Y.M. Vitale N. Huang P. Chasserot-Golaz S. Morris A.J. Bader M.F. Frohman M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 30Kurz T. Kemken D. Mier K. Weber I. Richardt G. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2004; 36: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas the synthesis of PIP2 by the three phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase isoforms is controlled by RhoA as well as Rac1 and Cdc42, implicating the regulation of PIP2 synthesis is central to signaling of these three Rho GTPases (31Schmidt M.

Therefore, Rac, PIP2, and PLD are probably involved in the same signaling pathways and positively regulate a variety of cellular functions (i.e. Rac activates the synthesis of PIP2, and PIP2 controls PLD activity). Furthermore, Rho family proteins including Rac1 are also well characterized activators of PLD (2Jenkins G.M. Frohman M.A. Cell. Mol.

Interestingly, Rac1 small GTPase, which is well known for its activity in promoting actin polymerization and the formation of lamellipodia, was also reported to be regulated by PLD through PA generated by the PLD-hydrolyzing membrane phosphatidylcholine (34Chae Y.C. Kim J.H. Kim K.L. Kim H.W. Lee H.Y. Heo W.D. Meyer T. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3111-3123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or through direct binding of PLD1 to Rac1 and/or Rho with its C terminus (Rho family proteins appear to bind to PLD1 between amino acids 984 and 1000 in human and rat PLD1) (10Powner D.J. Wakelam M.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 62-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 35Exton J.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These findings indicate a potential signaling feedback loop between Rac GTPase and PLDs. In neutrophils, PLD activation has been implicated in agonist-induced cell migration, exocytosis, phagocytosis of opsonized particles, and activation of NADPH oxidase (36Cockcroft S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 37Lehman N. Di Fulvio M. McCray N. Campos I. Tabatabaian F. Gomez-Cambronero J. Blood. 2006; 108: 3564-3572Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, expression of ARNO (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ARF) GTPases leads to increased activation of endogenous Rac1 and that Rac activation is required for ARNO-induced cell motility. On the other hand, ARNO-induced activation of ARF6 also results in increased activation of PLD, and inhibition of PLD activity also inhibits cell motility (38Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Based on the literature evidence shown above, we suspected that an interacting mechanism exists between PLD2 and Rac2. For this to occur, we hypothesized that the two proteins are in close spatial proximity in the cells where they can regulate each other and show evidence for this in the present study. In regard to the site of binding, and as far as we know, there were not previously any CRIB domains described in PLD2 that could account for it being an “effector” molecule that Rac uses for signaling. In fact, automatic searches looking for a CRIB domain PLD2 failed to turn up one; however, manual, more detailed comparative searches did uncover two CRIB-like domains in PLD2. We present evidence in this paper for the existence of two new CRIB domains in PLD2 that the protein uses to bind to Rac2 and modulate its biological activities. Primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology (IDT) (Coralville, IA). DNA sequencing was provided by Retrogen, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Pfu DNA polymerase was purchased through Stratagene (Santa Clara, CA). QIAquick gel extraction kit was purchase from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The In-Fusion Ready BacPAK Vector Set and the In-Fusion Dry-Down PCR Cloning kit were from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). Tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) reagent (chromagen solution) was from Invitrogen. Ninety-six-well ELISA plates were from BD Biosciences. Precise protein gels were purchased from Fisher. The construct pcDNA3.1-myc-PLD2aWT was used as a template to create to ΔCRIB deletion mutants (ΔCRIB-1 and ΔCRIB-2) after the QuikChangeXL site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following sets of primers: ΔCRIB-1 forward (5′-CCTCGAGACAGGTGCCAAAAGGAGCACGGAGGC-3′) and ΔCRIB-1 reverse (5′-GCCTCCGTGCTCCTTTTGGCACCTGTCTCGAGG-3′); ΔCRIB-2 forward (5′-GGTGGGCCCAAGAGGACAGCTACGCCCC-3′) and ΔCRIB-2 reverse (5′-GGGGCGTAGCTGTCCTCTTGGGCCCACC-3′). All oligonucleotides and their reverse complements were PAGE/HPLC-purified (Integrated DNA Technology). Molecular identity of the two pcDNA3.1-myc-PLD2 mutants was confirmed by direct sequence analysis (Agencourt Bioscience Group, Beverly, MA). For the donor of the FRET pair, we subcloned PLD2 into monomeric (m) C-Citrine (a derivative of YFP) (a gift from Joel Swanson, University of Michigan School of Medicine), and the new fluorescent chimera plasmid was named “YFP-PLD2.” For the donor of the FRET pair, we subcloned Rac2 into C-mCerulean (a derivative of CFP), and the new fluorescent chimera plasmid was named “CFP-Rac2.” Both plasmids were verified by direct sequencing, and their activities were verified by PLD activity and GTP binding (PBD pulldown) and found to be within the efficiencies of the parental plasmids (both N- and C-terminal end clones were generated, but the C-terminal clones consistently yielded activity levels closer to wild type). COS-7 cells were co-transfected with PLD2-mCitrine and Rac2-mCFP using FuGENE 6 reagent for 48 h (the cells were serum-starved for the last 16 h). When ready for microscopy, cells were left unstimulated. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with appropriate excitation and emission filter sets (Chroma Corp.) for CFP, YFP, and FRET (CFP excitation and YFP emission). Images were collected on a 14-bit Cascade HQII digital camera and were processed as described in Hoppe et al. (39Hoppe A. Christensen K. Swanson J.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3652-3664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) to determine the FRET stoichiometry of the interaction between PLD2 and Rac2. Fluorescence imaging showed basic wide field FRET microscopy: IA (PLD2-mCitrine), ID (Rac2-mCFP), and IF (FRET) images. Calculated FRET images are EA, ED, and RM. The mean average FRET efficiency over the entire cell (Eavg) was determined using Metamorph and Matlab software and reached a maximum of 0.15. For comparison, the linked CFP-Citrine positive control used for calibration of the microscope yields an Eavg of 0.37. Control experiments co-expressing PLD2-mCitrine and free CFP showed no FRET with or without EGF stimulation. An upstream SalI restriction enzyme digestion (RED) site and a downstream HindIII RED site were introduced into the homologous fragments for each polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product due to the sequences of the PCR primers. The PCR products for both PLD2 and Rac2 were amplified with Pfu DNA polymerase using the primers shown in Table 1. The PCR protocol was as follows for 35 cycles: predenaturing at 95 °C for 45 s, denature at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 60 °C for 45 s, elongation at 72 °C for 6 min, and then one final cycle of elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were purified with QIAquick gel extraction kit. In-Fusion Ready BacPAK Vector Set contained prelinearized vectors for adding either N- or C-terminal 6×HN tags to our proteins of interest. The recombinant reaction between the linearized vector and the PCR product was performed with In-Fusion Dry-Down PCR Cloning kit. The recombinant baculovirus plasmids were sent to Retrogen, Inc. for sequencing and verification. The recombinant baculovirus vector maps for PLD2 and Rac2 are depicted in supplemental Fig. 1, A and B, respectively.TABLE 1Baculovirus PCR primers (homologous sequences are in bold)DNASequence (5′-3′)FunctionLengthntPLD2TAAGGCCTCTGTCGACGAGCAGAAGCTGATCAGCGAGGAGGACCTGACGGCGACCCCTG (myc tag sequence is underlined)PCR forward primer59PLD2CAGAATTCGCAAGCTTTGTCCACACTTCTAGPCR reverse primer31Rac2TAAGGCCTCTGTCGACTACCCATACGATGTTCCGGATTACGCTCAGGCCATCAAG (HA tag sequence is underlined)PCR forward primer55Rac2CAGAATTCGCAAGCTTGAGGAGGCTGCAGPCR reverse primer29 Open table in a new tab Sf21 insect cells were maintained at 2 × 106 cells/ml in Complete Grace's Insect Cell media containing 3.3 g/liter yeastolate, 3.3 g/liter lactalbumin hydrolysate, and 10% fetal calf serum at 30 °C in the absence of CO2 using spinner flasks. For in vivo or in vitro assays, insect cells were maintained in monolayer cultures using 35-mm wells at 2 × 106 cells/well. A large scale overexpression of both PLD2 and Rac2 was set up from baculovirus, starting from pBacC1 clones infected in Sf21 insect cells. We selected virulent Bac-C1-HA-Rac2, Bac-C1-myc-PLD2-WT, and Bac-C1-myc-PLD2-ΔCRIB-1 recombinant viruses to infect Sf21 cells. Lysates from Sf21 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) in a spinner of Complete Grace's Insect Cell Culture Media were used to bind 6xHN-tagged proteins in TALON resin (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Washing buffer was 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0–7.5, 5 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, and elution buffer was 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0–7.5, 500 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl. Optical density at 280 nm was read from eluates of columns. Fractions were then dialyzed (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol) for 2 h. Aliquots were used for PAGE gels and for immunoblots that showed the prevalence of a protein of ∼22 kDa for Rac2 and, in separate experiments, of a protein of ∼110 kDa for PLD2. Purified 6xHN-myc-PLD2 (WT and deletion mutants) or Rac2 were incubated with PVC grade, non-tissue culture-treated 96-well plates. After blocking with 2% BSA and 0.2% Tween 20, the coated plates were then incubated with buffer only or with increasing amounts of the protein partner to be tested. After incubation at 37 °C, extensive washes of the 96-well plate followed. Anti-HA (or anti-Myc) monoclonal mouse antibodies were then added to the ELISA plate and allowed to interact with the purified, recombinant protein bound to the plastic. After a treatment with a secondary, anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate and tetramethyl benzidine (chromagen solution) treatments for 15 min at room temperature, the PLD2/Rac2 binding was quantified at 620 nm in a microplate spectrophotometer. Purified baculoviral PLD2 was processed for PLD2 activity in PC8 liposomes and n-[3H]butanol beginning with the addition of the following reagents (final concentrations): 3.5 mm PC8 phospholipid, 45 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), and 1.0 μCi of n-[3H]butanol in a liposome form as indicated in Liscovitch et al. (40Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with continuous shaking. The addition of 0.3 ml of ice-cold chloroform/methanol (1:2) stopped the reactions. Lipids were then isolated and resolved by thin layer chromatography. The amount of [3H]phosphatidylbutanol ([3H]PBut) that co-migrated with PBut standards was measured by scintillation spectrometry. 2 × 106 Sf21 insect cells were infected with no Rac2 baculovirus or with Rac2 baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5:1 (number of virus particles to number of insect cells). PLD2-WT baculovirus was also simultaneously co-infected using increasing multiplicities of infections from 5:1 to 50:1. Infections occurred for 48 h, after which time cells were activated using 100 ng/ml EGF for 7 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were prepared in special lysis buffer containing digitonin. Next, 5 μl of PAK-1-PBD-agarose was added to each lysate sample and incubated on a tube rotisserie at 4 °C for 30 min in the presence of the following magnesium lysis buffer (final concentrations): 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2% glycerol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Samples were sedimented and washed 3× in magnesium lysis buffer and resuspended in 1× SDS sample loading buffer. Samples were then denatured at 95 °C for 7 min. The supernatant of each sample was loaded onto 4–20% gradient Precise Protein gels and electrophoresed at 100 V for ∼1 h. Gels were transferred onto Whatman PVDF membranes for 1–2 h at 70 V. PVDF membranes were blocked for a few hours in 2% BSA, 0.2% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline at room temperature. PVDF membranes were then probed overnight at 4 °C with either α-HA antibodies to detect recombinant, GTP-bound Rac2 or α-Myc antibodies to detect recombinant PLD2 that interacted with Rac2 in the pulldown assay. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated with PVDFs, and then products were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL) and autoradiography. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. The difference between means was assessed by the single factor analysis of variance test. Probability of p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. PLD and Rac small GTPases are integral to cell signaling (37Lehman N. Di Fulvio M. McCray N. Campos I. Tabatabaian F. Gomez-Cambronero J. Blood. 2006; 108: 3564-3572Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 41Dinauer M.C. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2003; 10: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and PLD activity and Rac-GTP loading are both activated by the same stimuli and to approximately the same extent. Fig. 1A indicates that overexpression of cells with Rac2 and PLD2 leads to an increased cell adhesion functionality signifying that these two molecules appear to cooperate in the cell in some fashion. This happens, however, as long as the PLD2:Rac2 ratio is ≥1 (PLD2 DNA is in excess compared with Rac2 DNA in the transfection reactions). Conversely, using overexpression of cells with a PLD2:Rac2 ratio of <1, we found the opposite effect (Fig. 1B), that is, a decrease in cell adhesion. To understand the mechanism for these physiological events, we undertook a series of experiments with the hypothesis in mind that both proteins must be in close spatial proximity. As PLD and Rac are both activated with a profound effect on the kinetics of cell adhesion, it is reasonable to assume that both proteins must be in close spatial proximity. Fig. 2 demonstrates that Rac2 and PLD2 are associated in the cell, as they can both be immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for the other protein. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using two complementary approaches. First, COS-7 cells were transfected with tagged expression plasmids (Myc-Rac2 and HA-PLD2) (Fig. 2A) alone or in combination. In Fig. 2B, the top two panels are positive controls showing appropriate expression of transfected proteins. I.P. with α-Myc antibody and subsequent W.B. with α-HA antibody pulled down the HA-tagged PLD2 protein associated with Myc-tagged Rac2 (third panel). I.P. with the α-HA antibody and subsequent W.B. with the α-Myc antibody pulled down the Myc-tagged PLD2 protein associated with HA-tagged Rac2 (fourth panel). The fifth panel is a control to show equal loading in all lanes. All this demonstrates an association between PLD2 and Rac2 within the cell. We also generated fluorescent chimeras with a PLD2 tagged with YFP and Rac2 tagged with CFP (Fig. 2C) that would be used later for microscopy studies. It was also possible to demonstrate a PLD2-Rac2 association with these chimeras (Fig. 2D). To further confirm a Rac2-PLD2 association in the cell, we utilized a more sensitive technique: FRET. The PLD2 fluorescent chimera plasmid with mCitrine (a derivative of YFP) was named “PLD2-YFP.” This chimera showed strong protein expression and PLD2 enzymatic activity (not shown) when transfected in COS-7 cells. For the donor of the FRET pair, we chose Rac2-CFP. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with PLD2-YFP and Rac2-CFP for 48 h followed by fluorescence microscopy. Although ED varied slightly in different cells, the existence of FRET (Fig. 3) indicates that Rac2 and PLD2 indeed form a heterocomplex in the cell. Control experiments co-expressing PLD2-YFP and free CFP showed no FRET with or without EGF stimulation (data not shown). In summary, Rac2 and PLD2 exhibit significant FRET inside the cells in vivo indicating that Rac2 and PLD2 are in close enough geographic proximity (<7 nm apart) so as to form stable complexes in the cell upon EGF stimulation. The PLD2-Rac2 interaction begged the question as to the location of the Rac2 binding site on PLD2. To ascertain this, we generated several PLD2 mutants where we hypothesized that binding occurred. The rationale for choosing target sites was based on previous knowledge of sequences found in Rac2 binding partners. A CRIB motif has been shown to specifically bind the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 or Rac with a preference for Cdc42. The prototypes are the non-receptor-tyrosine kinase, ACK, and the serine/threonine kinase, PAK (Fig. 4A). The length of the consensus CRIB motif is ∼16 amino acids, containing a region of variable length between the two halves of the binding motif. The CRIB motif contains eight core amino acids with the sequence ISXPXXXXFXHXXHVG. However, proteins with one or two differences within the core sequence can still show binding to Cdc42/Rac. By standard data base searches, no obvious CRIB motif was immediately present in PLD2. Nevertheless, a manual search of the PLD2 amino acid sequence yielded two putative CRIB-like candidate amino acid segments that contained the key amino acids of the consensus in the appropriate order. One such putative Rac2 binding site is located inside the PH domain of PLD2 and the other is located mostly just outside of and downstream from the PH domain (Fig. 4B). We have named the first domain CRIB-1 (255ISFVQLFDPGFEVQGV270) and the second domain CRIB-2 (306ITELAQGPGRDFLQLHRHDSY326).

https://openalex.org/W2059267863,"Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), the lectin from the albumen gland of the Roman snail, has been used in histochemical studies relating glycosylation changes to the metastatic potential of solid tumors. To facilitate the use of HPA in a clinical (diagnostic) setting, detailed analysis of the lectin, including cloning and recombinant production of HPA, is required. A combination of isoelectric focusing, amino acid sequence analysis, and cloning revealed two polypeptides in native HPA preparations (HPAI and HPAII), both consistent with GalNAc-binding lectins of the H-type family. Pairwise sequence alignment showed that HPAI and HPAII share 54% sequence identity whereas molecular modeling using SWISS-MODEL suggests they are likely to adopt similar tertiary structure. The inherent heterogeneity of native HPA highlighted the need for production of functional recombinant protein; this was addressed by preparing His-thioredoxin-tagged fusion products in Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami B (DE3) cells. The recombinant lectins agglutinated human blood group A erythrocytes whereas their oligosaccharide specificity, evaluated using glycan microarrays, showed that they predominantly bind glycans with terminal α-GalNAc residues. Surface plasmon resonance with immobilized GalNAc-BSA confirmed that recombinant HPAI and HPAII bind strongly with this ligand (K(d) = 0.60 nm and 2.00 nm, respectively) with a somewhat higher affinity to native HPA (K(d) = 7.67 nm). Recombinant HPAII also bound the breast cancer cells of breast cancer tissue specimens in a manner similar to native lectin. The recombinant HPA described here shows important potential for future studies of cancer cell glycosylation and as a reagent for cancer prognostication."
https://openalex.org/W2094255509,"Background The focus in the research on biological motion perception traditionally has been restricted to the visual modality. Recent neurophysiological and behavioural evidence, however, supports the idea that actions are not represented merely visually but rather audiovisually. The goal of the present study was to test whether the perceived in-depth orientation of depth-ambiguous point-light walkers (plws) is affected by the presentation of looming or receding sounds synchronized with the footsteps. Methodology/Principal Findings In Experiment 1 orthographic frontal/back projections of plws were presented either without sound or with sounds of which the intensity level was rising (looming), falling (receding) or stationary. Despite instructions to ignore the sounds and to only report the visually perceived in-depth orientation, plws accompanied with looming sounds were more often judged to be facing the viewer whereas plws paired with receding sounds were more often judged to be facing away from the viewer. To test whether the effects observed in Experiment 1 act at a perceptual level rather than at the decisional level, in Experiment 2 observers perceptually compared orthographic plws without sound or paired with either looming or receding sounds to plws without sound but with perspective cues making them objectively either facing towards or facing away from the viewer. Judging whether either an orthographic plw or a plw with looming (receding) perspective cues is visually most looming becomes harder (easier) when the orthographic plw is paired with looming sounds. Conclusions/Significance The present results suggest that looming and receding sounds alter the judgements of the in-depth orientation of depth-ambiguous point-light walkers. While looming sounds are demonstrated to act at a perceptual level and make plws look more looming, it remains a challenge for future research to clarify at what level in the processing hierarchy receding sounds affect how observers judge the in-depth perception of plws."

The chrysophytes Ochromonas smithii and Ochromonas itoi are dominant in yellow-colored snow patches in mountainous heavy snow areas from late May to early June. It is considered to be effective utilizing the xanthophyll cycle and holding sunscreen pigments as protective system for snow algae blooming in the vulnerable environment such as low temperature and nutrients, and strong light, however the study on the photoprotection of chrysophytes snow algae has not been shown. To dissolve how the chrysophytes snow algae can grow and bloom under such an extreme environment, we studied with the object of light which is one point of significance to this problem. We collected the yellow snows and measured photosynthetically active radiation at Mt. Gassan in May 2008 when the bloom occurred, then tried to establish unialgal cultures of O. smithii and O. itoi, and examined their photosynthetic properties by a PAM chlorophyll fluorometer and analyzed the pigment compositions before and after illumination with high-light intensities to investigate the working xanthophyll cycle. This experimental study using unialgal cultures revealed that both O. smithii and O. itoi utilize only the efficient violaxanthin cycle for photoprotection as a dissipation system of surplus energy under prolonged high-light stress, although they possess chlorophyll c with diadinoxanthin."
https://openalex.org/W1991213945,"For some moth species, especially those closely interrelated and sympatric, recognizing a specific pheromone component concentration ratio is essential for males to successfully locate conspecific females. We propose and determine the properties of a minimalist competition-based feed-forward neuronal model capable of detecting a certain ratio of pheromone components independently of overall concentration. This model represents an elementary recognition unit for the ratio of binary mixtures which we propose is entirely contained in the macroglomerular complex (MGC) of the male moth. A set of such units, along with projection neurons (PNs), can provide the input to higher brain centres. We found that (1) accuracy is mainly achieved by maintaining a certain ratio of connection strengths between olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) and local neurons (LN), much less by properties of the interconnections between the competing LNs proper. An exception to this rule is that it is beneficial if connections between generalist LNs (i.e. excited by either pheromone component) and specialist LNs (i.e. excited by one component only) have the same strength as the reciprocal specialist to generalist connections. (2) successful ratio recognition is achieved using latency-to-first-spike in the LN populations which, in contrast to expectations with a population rate code, leads to a broadening of responses for higher overall concentrations consistent with experimental observations. (3) when longer durations of the competition between LNs were observed it did not lead to higher recognition accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2039885998,"MTMR2 is a member of the myotubularin family of inositol lipid phosphatases, a large protein-tyrosine phosphatase subgroup that is conserved from yeast to humans. Furthermore, the peripheral neuromuscular disease Charcot-Marie Tooth disease type 4B has been attributed to mutations in the mtmr2 gene. Because the molecular mechanisms regulating MTMR2 have been poorly defined, we investigated whether reversible phosphorylation might regulate MTMR2 function. We used mass spectrometry-based methods to identify a high stoichiometry phosphorylation site on serine 58 of MTMR2. Phosphorylation at Ser(58), or a phosphomimetic S58E mutation, markedly decreased MTMR2 localization to endocytic vesicular structures. In contrast, a phosphorylation-deficient MTMR2 mutant (S58A) displayed constitutive localization to early endocytic structures. This localization pattern was accompanied by displacement of a PI(3)P-specific sensor protein and an increase in signal transduction pathways. Thus, MTMR2 phosphorylation is likely to be a critical mechanism by which MTMR2 access to its lipid substrate(s) is temporally and spatially regulated, thereby contributing to the control of downstream endosome maturation events."
https://openalex.org/W1992776130,"Background Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired language, communication and social skills, as well as by repetitive and stereotypic patterns of behavior. Many autistic subjects display a dysregulation of the immune system which is compatible with an unresolved viral infection with prenatal onset, potentially due to vertical viral transmission. Recently, the xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) has been implicated in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and in prostate cancer by several, though not all studies. Methodology/Principal Findings We assessed whether XMRV or other murine leukemia virus (MLV)-related viruses are involved in autistic disorder. Using nested PCR targeted to gag genomic sequences, we screened DNA samples from: (i) peripheral blood of 102 ASD patients and 97 controls, (ii) post-mortem brain samples of 20 ASD patients and 17 sex- and age-matched controls, (iii) semen samples of 11 fathers of ASD children, 25 infertile individuals and 7 fertile controls. No XMRV gag DNA sequences were detected, whereas peripheral blood samples of 3/97 (3.1%) controls were positive for MLV. Conclusions|Significance No MLV-related virus was detected in blood, brain, and semen samples of ASD patients or fathers. Hence infection with XMRV or other MLV-related viruses is unlikely to contribute to autism pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2133956470,"The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signal transduction pathway integrates various signals, regulating ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis as a function of available energy and amino acids, and assuring an appropriate coupling of cellular proliferation with increases in cell size. In addition, recent evidence has pointed to an interplay between the mTOR and p53 pathways. We investigated the genetic variability of 67 key genes in the mTOR pathway and in genes of the p53 pathway which interact with mTOR. We tested the association of 1,084 tagging SNPs with prostate cancer risk in a study of 815 prostate cancer cases and 1,266 controls nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). We chose the SNPs (n = 11) with the strongest association with risk (p<0.01) and sought to replicate their association in an additional series of 838 prostate cancer cases and 943 controls from EPIC. In the joint analysis of first and second phase two SNPs of the PRKCI gene showed an association with risk of prostate cancer (OR(allele) = 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.94, p = 1.3 x 10⁻³ for rs546950 and OR(allele) = 0.84, 95% CI 0.76-0.93, p = 5.6 x 10⁻⁴ for rs4955720). We confirmed this in a meta-analysis using as replication set the data from the second phase of our study jointly with the first phase of the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) project. In conclusion, we found an association with prostate cancer risk for two SNPs belonging to PRKCI, a gene which is frequently overexpressed in various neoplasms, including prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2084646682,"Mutations within MYO7A can lead to recessive and dominant forms of inherited hearing loss. We previously identified a large pedigree (referred to as the HL2 family) with hearing loss that first impacts the low and mid frequencies segregating a dominant MYO7A mutation in exon 17 at DNA residue G2164C. The MYO7A(G2164C) mutation predicts a nonconservative glycine-to-arginine (G722R) amino acid substitution at a highly conserved glycine residue. The degree of low and mid frequency hearing loss varies markedly in the family, suggesting the presence of a genetic modifier that either rescues or exacerbates the primary MYO7A(G2164C) mutation. Here we describe a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) T/C at position -4128 in the wild-type MYO7A promoter allele that sorts with the degree of hearing loss severity in the pedigree. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis indicates that the SNP differentially regulates the binding of the YY1 transcription factor with the T(-4128) allele creating an YY1 binding site. Immunocytochemistry demonstrates that Yy1 is expressed in hair cell nuclei within the cochlea. Given that Myo7a is also expressed in cochlear hair cells, Yy1 shows the appropriate localization to regulate Myo7a transcription within the inner ear. YY1 appears to be acting as a transcriptional repressor as the MYO7A promoter allele containing the T(-4128) SNP drives 41 and 46% less reporter gene expression compared with the C(-4128) SNP in the ARPE-19 and HeLa cell lines, respectively. The T(-4128) SNP may be contributing to the severe hearing loss phenotype in the HL2 pedigree by reducing expression of the wild-type MYO7A allele."
https://openalex.org/W2035528599,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are expressed in the brain and heart and are essential for physiological functions in cardiac and nervous systems. We identified two Hcn4 mRNA variants with different transcription start sites and differential expression patterns in mouse brain and heart. Only one mRNA variant was detected in the brain, whereas both variants were found in the heart. Patch clamp recordings of these two variants in HEK293H cells revealed different electrophysiological properties in channel activation. Mutagenesis studies showed that three positively charged amino acids (Arg-9, Lys-10, and Lys-22) contribute to the functional difference. Our results demonstrate that HCN4 channels are expressed in different patterns in mouse brain and heart and that the N terminus is important for HCN4 channel activation."
