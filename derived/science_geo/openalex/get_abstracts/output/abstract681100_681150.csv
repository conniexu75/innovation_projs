https://openalex.org/W3199620752,"The number and variability of the neutralizing epitopes targeted by polyclonal antibodies in individuals who are SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and vaccinated are key determinants of neutralization breadth and the genetic barrier to viral escape1-4. Using HIV-1 pseudotypes and plasma selection experiments with vesicular stomatitis virus/SARS-CoV-2 chimaeras5, here we show that multiple neutralizing epitopes, within and outside the receptor-binding domain, are variably targeted by human polyclonal antibodies. Antibody targets coincide with spike sequences that are enriched for diversity in natural SARS-CoV-2 populations. By combining plasma-selected spike substitutions, we generated synthetic 'polymutant' spike protein pseudotypes that resisted polyclonal antibody neutralization to a similar degree as circulating variants of concern. By aggregating variant of concern-associated and antibody-selected spike substitutions into a single polymutant spike protein, we show that 20 naturally occurring mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are sufficient to generate pseudotypes with near-complete resistance to the polyclonal neutralizing antibodies generated by individuals who are convalescent or recipients who received an mRNA vaccine. However, plasma from individuals who had been infected and subsequently received mRNA vaccination neutralized pseudotypes bearing this highly resistant SARS-CoV-2 polymutant spike, or diverse sarbecovirus spike proteins. Thus, optimally elicited human polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should be resilient to substantial future SARS-CoV-2 variation and may confer protection against potential future sarbecovirus pandemics."

https://openalex.org/W3199955373,"At present, the digital economy, which takes information technology and data as the key elements, is booming and has become an important force in promoting the economic growth of various countries. In order to explore the current dynamic trend of China's digital economy development and the impact of the digital economy on the high-quality economic development, this paper measures the digital economic development index of 30 cities in China from the three dimensions of digital infrastructure, digital industry, and digital integration, uses panel data of 30 cities in China from 2015 to 2019 to construct an econometric model for empirical analysis, and verifies the mediating effect of technological progress between the digital economy and high-quality economic development. The results show that (1) The development level of China's digital economy is increasing year by year, that the growth of digital infrastructure is obvious, and that the development of the digital industry is relatively slow. (2) Digital infrastructure, digital industry and digital integration all have significant positive effects on regional total factor productivity, and the influence coefficients are 0.2452, 0.0773 and 0.3458 respectively. (3) Regarding the transmission mechanism from the digital economy to the high-quality economic development, the study finds that the mediating effect of technological progress is 0.1527, of which the mediating effect of technological progress in the eastern, northeast, central and western regions is 1.70%, 9.25%, 28.89% and 21.22% respectively. (4) From the perspective of spatial distribution, the development level of the digital economy in the eastern region is much higher than that in other non-eastern regions, and the development of digital economy in the eastern region has a higher marginal contribution rate to the improvement of the total factor productivity. This study can provide a theoretical basis and practical support for the government to formulate policies for the development of the digital economy."
https://openalex.org/W3199229556,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to far-reaching restrictions of social and professional life, affecting societies all over the world. To contain the virus, medical schools had to restructure their curriculum by switching to online learning. However, only few medical schools had implemented such novel learning concepts. We aimed to evaluate students’ attitudes to online learning to provide a broad scientific basis to guide future development of medical education. Methods Overall, 3286 medical students from 12 different countries participated in this cross-sectional, web-based study investigating various aspects of online learning in medical education. On a 7-point Likert scale, participants rated the online learning situation during the pandemic at their medical schools, technical and social aspects, and the current and future role of online learning in medical education. Results The majority of medical schools managed the rapid switch to online learning (78%) and most students were satisfied with the quantity (67%) and quality (62%) of the courses. Online learning provided greater flexibility (84%) and led to unchanged or even higher attendance of courses (70%). Possible downsides included motivational problems (42%), insufficient possibilities for interaction with fellow students (67%) and thus the risk of social isolation (64%). The vast majority felt comfortable using the software solutions (80%). Most were convinced that medical education lags behind current capabilities regarding online learning (78%) and estimated the proportion of online learning before the pandemic at only 14%. In order to improve the current curriculum, they wish for a more balanced ratio with at least 40% of online teaching compared to on-site teaching. Conclusion This study demonstrates the positive attitude of medical students towards online learning. Furthermore, it reveals a considerable discrepancy between what students demand and what the curriculum offers. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic might be the long-awaited catalyst for a new “online era” in medical education."

https://openalex.org/W3199507053,"Emergence of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants has raised concerns related to the effectiveness of vaccines and antibody therapeutics developed against the unmutated wildtype virus. Here, we examined the effect of the 12 most commonly occurring mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein on its expression, stability, activity, and antibody escape potential. Stability was measured using thermal denaturation, and the activity and antibody escape potential were measured using isothermal titration calorimetry in terms of binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and to neutralizing human antibody CC12.1, respectively. Our results show that mutants differ in their expression levels. Of the eight best-expressed mutants, two (N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y) showed stronger affinity to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 compared with the wildtype, whereas four (Y453F, S477N, T478I, and S494P) had similar affinity and two (K417N and E484K) had weaker affinity than the wildtype. Compared with the wildtype, four mutants (K417N, Y453F, N501Y, and K417T/E484K/N501Y) had weaker affinity for the CC12.1 antibody, whereas two (S477N and S494P) had similar affinity, and two (T478I and E484K) had stronger affinity than the wildtype. Mutants also differ in their thermal stability, with the two least stable mutants showing reduced expression. Taken together, these results indicate that multiple factors contribute toward the natural selection of variants, and all these factors need to be considered to understand the evolution of the virus. In addition, since not all variants can escape a given neutralizing antibody, antibodies to treat new variants can be chosen based on the specific mutations in that variant."
https://openalex.org/W3200912278,"Background Adverse reactions are more common after the second injection of messenger RNA vaccines such as Pfizer/BioNTech’s BNT162b2. We hypothesized that the degree and severity of reactogenicity after the second injection reflects the magnitude of antibody production against the SARS CoV-2 virus spike protein (spike IgG). Methods and results Blood samples were obtained from 67 Japanese healthcare workers three weeks after the first injection and two weeks after the second injection of the BNT162b2 vaccine to measure spike IgG levels. Using questionnaires, we calculated an adverse event (AE) score (0–11) for each participant. The geometric mean of spike IgG titers increased from 1,047 antibody units (AU/mL) (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 855–1282 AU/mL) after the first injection to 17,378 AU/mL (95% CI: 14,622–20,663 AU/mL) after the second injection. The median AE score increased from 2 to 5. Spike IgG levels after the second injection were negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with spike IgG after the first injection. AE scores after the second injection were not significantly associated with log-transformed spike IgG after the second injection, when adjusted for age, sex, AE score after the first injection, and log-transformed spike IgG after the first injection. Conclusions Although the sample size was relatively small, reactogenicity after the second injection may not accurately reflect antibody production."
https://openalex.org/W3201017316,"Associative memories are stored in distributed networks extending across multiple brain regions. However, it is unclear to what extent sensory cortical areas are part of these networks. Using a paradigm for visual category learning in mice, we investigated whether perceptual and semantic features of learned category associations are already represented at the first stages of visual information processing in the neocortex. Mice learned categorizing visual stimuli, discriminating between categories and generalizing within categories. Inactivation experiments showed that categorization performance was contingent on neuronal activity in the visual cortex. Long-term calcium imaging in nine areas of the visual cortex identified changes in feature tuning and category tuning that occurred during this learning process, most prominently in the postrhinal area (POR). These results provide evidence for the view that associative memories form a brain-wide distributed network, with learning in early stages shaping perceptual representations and supporting semantic content downstream."
https://openalex.org/W3199673685,"Background LGBTQ2S youth are overrepresented among youth experiencing homelessness and experience significantly higher rates of mental health issues compared to heterosexual and cisgender youth. COVID-19 related challenges for LGBTQ2S youth experiencing homelessness remain unknown. To address this gap, this study aimed to understand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on LGBTQ2S youth at risk of, and experiencing, homelessness in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada and surrounding areas. Methods Utilizing a mixed-methods convergent parallel design, LGBTQ2S youth experiencing homelessness were recruited to participate in virtual surveys and in-depth one-on-one interviews. Surveys included standardized measures and were administered to measure mental health outcomes and collect information on demographic characteristics, and health service use. Survey data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and statistical tests for difference of proportions. Interviews were analyzed using an iterative thematic content approach. Results Sixty-one youth completed surveys and 20 youth participated in one-on-one interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data showed that youth have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in various ways, including experiencing poor mental health, such as suicidality, depression, anxiety, and increased substance use, and lack of access to health and social support services. Conclusion Our study highlights the need for LGBTQ2S inclusive and affirming health care and support services for precariously housed adolescents to address the pre-existing social and health issues that have been exacerbated by the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3201287171,"How an estuary responds to sea level rise (SLR) is complex and depends on energy drivers (e.g., tides and river inflows), estuarine geometry (e.g., length and depth), intrinsic fluid properties (e.g., density), and bed/bank roughness. While changes to the tidal range under SLR can impact estuarine sediment transport, water quality, and vegetation communities, studies on the altered tidal range under SLR are often based on case studies with outcomes applicable to a specific site. As such, this study produced a large ensemble of estuarine hydrodynamic models (&gt;1800) to provide a systematic understanding of how tidal range dynamics within different estuary types may change under various SLR and river inflow scenarios. The results indicated that SLR often amplifies the tidal range of different estuary types, except for short estuaries with a low tidal range at the mouth where SLR attenuates the tides. SLR alters the location of the points with minimum tidal range and overall tidal range patterns in an estuary. Variations in tidal range were more evident in converging estuaries, shallower systems, or in estuaries with strong river inflows. These findings provide an indication of how different estuary types may respond to estuaries and may assist estuarine managers and decision makers."
https://openalex.org/W3201145943,"Introduction Diarrhea is responsible for the death of more than 90% of under-five children in low and lower-middle income countries. Regionally, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 88% of deaths with the same age group. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and associated factors of diarrhea among children under-five years in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods The appended, most recent demographic and health survey datasets of 34 sub-Saharan African countries were used to determine the prevalence and associated factors of diarrhea among under-five children in the region. A total weighted sample of 330,866 under-five children were included in the study. Both bivariable and multivariable multilevel logistic regression were done to determine the associated factors of diarrhea among under five children in sub-Saharan Africa. The Odds Ratio (OR) with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was calculated for those potential factors included in the final model. Result The overall prevalence of diarrhea in this study was 15.3% (95% CI: 15.1–15.4). Those children of mothers aged 15–24 (AOR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.23, 1.30) and 25–34 years (AOR = 1.15; 95%CI: 1.12, 1.18), those children of mothers with no education (AOR = 1.69; 95%CI: 1.57–1.82), primary education (AOR = 1.73; 95%CI: 1.61–1.86) and secondary education (AOR = 1.49; 95%CI: 1.38–1.59) had higher odds of having diarrhea. Those children from poorest (AOR = 1.14; 95%CI: 1.10, 1.19), poorer (AOR = 1.12; 95%CI: 1.08–1.17), middle (AOR = 1.06; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.10), and richer (AOR = 1.14; 95%CI: 1.04–1.12) households had higher chance of having diarrhea compared to their counterparts. Conclusion This study found that the prevalence of childhood diarrhea morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa was high. Maternal age, wealth index, maternal education, maternal occupation, age of child, time of initiation of breast feeding and time to get water source were significantly associated with diarrhea. Therefore, intervention through health education and health promotion for mothers/caretakers who are poor, less educated, and young should be designed to prevent diarrhea in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3201521140,"Anthropogenic activities are changing the state of ecosystems worldwide, affecting community composition and often resulting in loss of biodiversity. Rivers are among the most impacted ecosystems. Recording their current state with regular biomonitoring is important to assess the future trajectory of biodiversity. Traditional monitoring methods for ecological assessments are costly and time-intensive. Here, we compared monitoring of macroinvertebrates based on environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling with monitoring based on traditional kick-net sampling to assess biodiversity patterns at 92 river sites covering all major Swiss river catchments. From the kick-net community data, a biotic index (IBCH) based on 145 indicator taxa had been established. The index was matched by the taxonomically annotated eDNA data by using a machine learning approach. Our comparison of diversity patterns only uses the zero-radius Operational Taxonomic Units assigned to the indicator taxa. Overall, we found a strong congruence between both methods for the assessment of the total indicator community composition (gamma diversity). However, when assessing biodiversity at the site level (alpha diversity), the methods were less consistent and gave complementary data on composition. Specifically, environmental DNA retrieved significantly fewer indicator taxa per site than the kick-net approach. Importantly, however, the subsequent ecological classification of rivers based on the detected indicators resulted in similar biotic index scores for the kick-net and the eDNA data that was classified using a random forest approach. The majority of the predictions (72%) from the random forest classification resulted in the same river status categories as the kick-net approach. Thus, environmental DNA validly detected indicator communities and, combined with machine learning, provided reliable classifications of the ecological state of rivers. Overall, while environmental DNA gives complementary data on the macroinvertebrate community composition compared to the kick-net approach, the subsequently calculated indices for the ecological classification of river sites are nevertheless directly comparable and consistent."
https://openalex.org/W3200006654,"Introduction The widespread use of face masks by the general public may help to prevent the spread of viruses. Face masks are thought to be a good strategy to protect against respiratory diseases such as the Coronavirus. Identifying student knowledge, attitude, and practice about the use of face masks is crucial to detect vulnerabilities and respond rapidly to avoid the spread of the infection. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practices of face mask utilization and associated factors in the COVID-19 pandemic among college students. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed from February to March 2021 among 764 students from Wachemo University, Southern Ethiopia. A multistage sampling technique was used in the study. The sample size for each department was allocated in proportion to the number of students in that department, and each respondent was chosen using a simple random sampling procedure. Data were collected using a pre-tested self-administered questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 26. To predict the relationship between the predictor and outcome variables, a logistic regression model was used. At a p-value of 0.05, statistical significance was declared. Results The study showed that the overall knowledge of the students was 223 (29.2%), their attitude was 673 (88.1%), and their practice was 684 (89.5%). The students from the college natural and computational sciences (AOR: 0.23; 95%CI: 0.13, 0.40) and students having good knowledge (AOR = 4.40; 95%CI; 2.13, 9.14) were found to be independently associated with face mask utilization. Conclusion When compared to other researches, the knowledge about the usage of face masks in this study was low, but the attitudes and practices were high. Authorities in areas that are in danger of a COVID-19 pandemic should plan and implement public awareness and education initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W3201258068,"Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) plays a key role in intracellular lipolysis, the mobilization of stored triacylglycerol. This work provides an important basis for generating reproducible and detailed data on the hydrolytic and transacylation activities of ATGL. We generated full-length and C-terminally truncated ATGL variants fused with various affinity tags and analyzed their expression in different hosts, namely E.coli, the insect cell line Sf9, and the mammalian cell line human embryonic kidney 293T. Based on this screen, we expressed a fusion protein of ATGL covering residues M1-D288 flanked with N-terminal and C-terminal purification tags. Using these fusions, we identified key steps in expression and purification protocols, including production in the E. coli strain ArcticExpress (DE3) and removal of copurified chaperones. The resulting purified ATGL variant demonstrated improved lipolytic activity compared with previously published data, and it could be stimulated by the coactivator protein comparative gene identification-58 and inhibited by the protein G0/G1 switch protein 2. Shock freezing and storage did not affect the basal activity but reduced coactivation of ATGL by comparative gene identification 58. In vitro, the truncated ATGL variant demonstrated acyl-CoA-independent transacylation activity when diacylglycerol was offered as substrate, resulting in the formation of fatty acid as well as triacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol. However, the ATGL variant showed neither hydrolytic activity nor transacylation activity upon offering of monoacylglycerol as substrate. To understand the role of ATGL in different physiological contexts, it is critical for future studies to identify all its different functions and to determine under what conditions these activities occur."
https://openalex.org/W3199424252,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic continues to overwhelm health systems across the globe. We aimed to assess the readiness of hospitals in Nigeria to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. Method Between April and October 2020, hospital representatives completed a modified World Health Organisation (WHO) COVID-19 hospital readiness checklist consisting of 13 components and 124 indicators. Readiness scores were classified as adequate (score ≥80%), moderate (score 50–79.9%) and not ready (score &lt;50%). Results Among 20 (17 tertiary and three secondary) hospitals from all six geopolitical zones of Nigeria, readiness score ranged from 28.2% to 88.7% (median 68.4%), and only three (15%) hospitals had adequate readiness. There was a median of 15 isolation beds, four ICU beds and four ventilators per hospital, but over 45% of hospitals established isolation facilities and procured ventilators after the onset of COVID-19. Of the 13 readiness components, the lowest readiness scores were reported for surge capacity (61.1%), human resources (59.1%), staff welfare (50%) and availability of critical items (47.7%). Conclusion Most hospitals in Nigeria were not adequately prepared to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. Current efforts to strengthen hospital preparedness should prioritize challenges related to surge capacity, critical care for COVID-19 patients, and staff welfare and protection."
https://openalex.org/W3201555618,"Sweet potato ( Ipomoea batatas L.) cultivation in Turkey is concentrated in one province situated in Mediterranean region only, which would not fulfill the domestic needs of the country soon. Therefore, cultivation of the crop in other provinces/climatic regions should be initiated to fulfill the domestic needs. The cultivation in other provinces requires thorough assessment of yield and quality traits of target crop. Therefore, yield and quality characteristics of four sweet potato genotypes (i.e., ‘Hatay Kırmızısı’, ‘Hatay Yerlisi’, ‘Havuc’ and ‘Kalem’) were assessed in the current study in Kazova and Niksar counties of Tokat province of the country having middle Black Sea climate in field experiments during 2018 and 2019. The cuttings of the genotypes were planted in Niksar during the second fortnight of April and first week of May in Kazova. The planting density was kept 90 × 45 cm. Data relating to number of storage roots, storage root weight, storage root yield per hill and storage root yield per hectare were recorded. Furthermore, quality traits, including dry matter ratio (%), protein ratio (%) and antioxidant ratio (%) of storage roots were also determined. The highest total storage root yield was recorded for ‘Havuc’ genotype during both years and locations, followed by ‘Hatay Yerlisi’ and ‘Hatay Kırmızısı’ genotypes. Overall, storage root yield (60.06 and 62.40 tons ha -1 during first and second year) recorded for the experiment at Niksar was higher than the storage root yield recorded for Kazova experiment (53.50 and 52.84 tons ha -1 during first and second year, respectively). The highest dry matter was produced by ‘Kalem’ and ‘Hatay Yerlisi’ genotypes during both years and at both locations, followed by ‘Hatay Kırmızısı’ and ‘Havuc’ genotypes. The storage roots of the tested genotypes accumulated higher dry matter at Kazova during both years. The highest protein content was obtained from the ‘Kalem’ genotype, and the protein contents of the ‘Hatay Yerlisi’ and ‘Hatay Kırmızısı’ genotypes were close to the ‘Kalem’ genotype. The results indicated that tested genotypes can successfully be cultivated in middle Black Sea climate. Therefore, production of sweet potato can be initiated in the future to meet the domestic needs for sweet potato in the country."
https://openalex.org/W3201590296,"Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is an established regulator of cellular state and its critical contributions to tumor initiation, malignant tumor progression and metastasis formation have been demonstrated in various cancer types. Here, we investigated how the binding of β-catenin to the transcriptional coactivators B-cell CLL/lymphoma 9 (Bcl9) and Bcl9-Like (Bcl9L) affected mammary gland carcinogenesis in the MMTV-PyMT transgenic mouse model of metastatic breast cancer. Conditional knockout of both Bcl9 and Bcl9L resulted into tumor cell death. In contrast, disrupting the interaction of Bcl9/Bcl9L with β-catenin, either by deletion of their HD2 domains or by a point mutation in the N-terminal domain of β-catenin (D164A), diminished primary tumor growth and tumor cell proliferation and reduced tumor cell invasion and lung metastasis. In comparison, the disruption of HD1 domain-mediated binding of Bcl9/Bcl9L to Pygopus had only moderate effects. Interestingly, interfering with the β-catenin-Bcl9/Bcl9L-Pygo chain of adapters only partially impaired the transcriptional response of mammary tumor cells to Wnt3a and TGFβ treatments. Together, the results indicate that Bcl9/Bcl9L modulate but are not critically required for canonical Wnt signaling in its contribution to breast cancer growth and malignant progression, a notion consistent with the ""just-right"" hypothesis of Wnt-driven tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W3200850076,"Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serotype Dublin is a host-adapted serotype in cattle, associated with enteritis and systemic disease. The primary clinical manifestation of Salmonella Dublin infection in cattle, especially calves, is respiratory disease. While rare in humans, it can cause severe illness, including bacteremia, with hospitalization and death. In the United States, S. Dublin has become one of the most multidrug-resistant serotypes. The objective of this study was to characterize S. Dublin isolates from sick cattle by analyzing phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles, the presence of plasmids, and phylogenetic relationships. S. Dublin isolates (n = 140) were selected from submissions to the NVSL for Salmonella serotyping (2014-2017) from 21 states. Isolates were tested for susceptibility against 14 class-representative antimicrobial drugs. Resistance profiles were determined using the ABRicate with Resfinder and NCBI databases, AMRFinder and PointFinder. Plasmids were detected using ABRicate with PlasmidFinder. Phylogeny was determined using vSNP. We found 98% of the isolates were resistant to more than 4 antimicrobials. Only 1 isolate was pan-susceptible and had no predicted AMR genes. All S. Dublin isolates were susceptible to azithromycin and meropenem. They showed 96% resistance to sulfonamides, 97% to tetracyclines, 95% to aminoglycosides and 85% to beta-lactams. The most common AMR genes were: sulf2 and tetA (98.6%), aph(6)-Id (97.9%), aph(3'')-Ib, (97.1%), floR (94.3%), and blaCMY-2 (85.7%). All quinolone resistant isolates presented mutations in gyrA. Ten plasmid types were identified among all isolates with IncA/C2, IncX1, and IncFII(S) being the most frequent. The S. Dublin isolates show low genomic genetic diversity. This study provided antimicrobial susceptibility and genomic insight into S. Dublin clinical isolates from cattle in the U.S. Further sequence analysis integrating food and human origin S. Dublin isolates may provide valuable insight on increased virulence observed in humans."

The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of seat pan and pelvis angles on the kinematics and injury risk of a reclined occupant by numerical simulation of a frontal sled test. The occupant, represented by a detailed 50th percentile male human body model, was positioned on a semi-rigid seat. Three seat pan angles (5, 15, and 25 degrees from the horizontal) were used, all with a seatback angle of 40 degrees from the vertical. Three pelvis angles (60, 70, and 80 degrees from the vertical), representing a nominal and two relaxed sitting positions, were used for each seat pan angle. The model was restrained using a pre-inflated airbag and a three-point seatbelt equipped with a pretensioner and a load limiter before being subjected to two frontal crash pulses. Both model kinematic response and predicted injury risk were affected by the seat pan and the pelvis angles in a reclined seatback position. Submarining occurrence and injury risk increased with lower seat pan angle, higher pelvis angle, and acceleration pulse severity. In some cases (in particular for a 15 degrees seat pan), a small variation in seat pan or pelvis angle resulted in large differences in terms of kinematics and predicted injury. This study highlights the potential effects of the seat pan and pelvis angles for reclined occupant protection. These parameters should be assessed experimentally with volunteers to determine which combinations are most likely to be adopted for comfort and with post mortem human surrogates to confirm their significance during impact and to provide data for model validation. The sled and restraint models used in this study are provided under an open-source license to facilitate further comparisons."
https://openalex.org/W3201415152,"Certain clinical indications and treatments such as the use of rasburicase in cancer therapy and 8-aminoquinolines for Plasmodium vivax malaria treatment would benefit from a point-of-care test for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Three studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of one such test: the STANDARD ™ G6PD Test (SD BIOSENSOR, South Korea). First, biological interference on the test performance was evaluated in specimens with common blood disorders, including high white blood cell (WBC) counts. Second, the test precision on fingerstick specimens was evaluated against five individuals of each, deficient, intermediate, and normal G6PD activity status. Third, clinical performance of the test was evaluated at three point-of-care settings in the United States. The test performed equivalently to the reference assay in specimens with common blood disorders. High WBC count blood samples resulted in overestimation of G6PD activity in both the reference assay and the STANDARD G6PD Test. The STANDARD G6PD Test showed good precision on multiple fingerstick specimens from the same individual. The same G6PD threshold values (U/g Hb) were applied for a semiquantitative interpretation for fingerstick- and venous-derived results. The sensitivity/specificity values (95% confidence intervals) for the test for G6PD deficiency were 100 (92.3–100.0)/97 (95.2–98.2) and 100 (95.7–100.0)/97.4 (95.7–98.5) for venous and capillary specimens, respectively. The same values for females with intermediate (&gt; 30% to ≤ 70%) G6PD activity were 94.1 (71.3–99.9)/88.2 (83.9–91.7) and 82.4 (56.6–96.2)/87.6(83.3–91.2) for venous and capillary specimens, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W3199499598,"Impairments in mitochondrial energy metabolism have been implicated in human genetic diseases associated with mitochondrial and nuclear DNA mutations, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and aging. Alteration in mitochondrial complex I structure and activity has been shown to play a key role in Parkinson's disease and ischemia/reperfusion tissue injury, but significant difficulty remains in assessing the content of this enzyme complex in a given sample. The present study introduces a new method utilizing native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in combination with flavin fluorescence scanning to measure the absolute content of complex I, as well as α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, in any preparation. We show that complex I content is 19 ± 1 pmol/mg of protein in the brain mitochondria, whereas varies up to 10-fold in different mouse tissues. Together with the measurements of NADH-dependent specific activity, our method also allows accurate determination of complex I catalytic turnover, which was calculated as 104 min-1 for NADH:ubiquinone reductase in mouse brain mitochondrial preparations. α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex content was determined to be 65 ± 5 and 123 ± 9 pmol/mg protein for mouse brain and bovine heart mitochondria, respectively. Our approach can also be extended to cultured cells, and we demonstrated that about 90 × 103 complex I molecules are present in a single human embryonic kidney 293 cell. The ability to determine complex I content should provide a valuable tool to investigate the enzyme status in samples after in vivo treatment in mutant organisms, cells in culture, or human biopsies."
https://openalex.org/W3200160418,"Anti-nutritional compounds such as non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) are present in viscous cereals used in feed for poultry. Therefore, exogenous carbohydrases are commonly added to monogastric feed to degrade these NSP. Our hypothesis is that xylanase not only improves laying hen performance and digestibility, but also induces a significant shift in microbial composition within the intestinal tract and thereby might exert a prebiotic effect. In this context, a better understanding on whether and how the chicken gut microbial population can be modulated by xylanase is required. To do so, the effects of dietary supplementation of xylanase on performance, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and cecal microbiome in laying hens were evaluated in the present study. A total of 96 HiSex laying hens were used in this experiment (3 diets and 16 replicates of 2 hens). Xylanase was added to the diets at concentrations of 0, 45,000 (15 g/t Xygest TM HT) and 90,000 U/kg (30 g/t Xygest HT). The diets were based on wheat (~55%), soybean and sunflower meal. The lowest dosage, 45,000 U/kg, significantly increased average egg weight and improved feed efficiency compared to the control treatment (P&lt;0.05). Egg quality parameters were significantly improved in the experiment in response to the xylanase addition. For example, during the last 28 days of the trial, birds receiving the 45,000 U/kg and the 90,000 U/kg treatments exhibited an increase in Haugh units and albumin heights (P&lt;0.05). Compared with the control, the ATTD of organic matter and crude protein were drastically improved in the 45,000 U/kg treatment group (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, gross energy and the ATTD of crude fat were improved significantly for birds fed 90,000 U/kg group compared to the control. Importantly, 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that xylanase at 45,000 U/kg dosage can exert a change in the cecal microbiome. A significant increase in beneficial bacteria ( Bacilli class; Enterococcaceae and Lactobacillales orders; Merdibacter , Enterococcus and Nocardiopsis genera; Enterococcus casseliflavus species) was documented when adding 45,000 U/kg xylanase to the diet of laying hens. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of xylanase 45,000 U/kg significantly improved laying hen performance and digestibility. Furthermore, microbiome data suggest that xylanase modulates the laying hen bacterial population beneficially, thus potentially exerting a prebiotic effect."
https://openalex.org/W3200255026,"There has been accumulating evidence for the clinical benefit of chemoradiation therapy (CRT), whereas mechanisms in CRT-recurrent clones derived from the primary tumor are still elusive. Herein, we identified an aberrant BUB1B/BUBR1 expression in CRT-recurrent clones in bladder cancer (BC) by comprehensive proteomic analysis. CRT-recurrent BC cells exhibited a cell-cycle-independent upregulation of BUB1B/BUBR1 expression rendering an enhanced DNA repair activity in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). With DNA repair analyses employing the CRISPR/cas9 system, we revealed that cells with aberrant BUB1B/BUBR1 expression dominantly exploit mutagenic nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). We further found that phosphorylated ATM interacts with BUB1B/BUBR1 after ionizing radiation (IR) treatment, and the resistance to DSBs by increased BUB1B/BUBR1 depends on the functional ATM. In vivo, tumor growth of CRT-resistant T24R cells was abrogated by ATM inhibition using AZD0156. A dataset analysis identified FOXM1 as a putative BUB1B/BUBR1-targeting transcription factor causing its increased expression. These data collectively suggest a redundant role of BUB1B/BUBR1 underlying mutagenic NHEJ in an ATM-dependent manner, aside from the canonical activity of BUB1B/BUBR1 on the G2/M checkpoint, and offer novel clues to overcome CRT resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3200363939,"Objectives Empathy is fundamental to social cognition, driving prosocial behaviour and mental health but associations with aging and other socio-demographic characteristics are unclear. We therefore aimed to characterise associations of these characteristics with two main self-reported components of empathy, namely empathic-concern (feeling compassion) and perspective-taking (understanding others’ perspective). Methods We asked participants in an internet-based survey of UK-dwelling adults aged ≥18 years to complete the Interpersonal Reactivity Index subscales measuring empathic concern and perspective taking, and sociodemographic and personality questionnaires. We weighted the sample to be UK population representative and employed multivariable weighted linear regression models. Results In 30,033 respondents, mean empathic concern score was 3.86 (95% confidence interval 3.85, 3.88) and perspective taking was 3.57 (3.56. 3.59); the correlation between these sub-scores was 0.45 (p &lt; 0.001). Empathic concern and perspective taking followed an inverse-u shape trajectory in women with peak between 40 and 50 years whereas in men, perspective taking declines with age but empathic concern increases. In fully adjusted models, greater empathic concern was associated with female gender, non-white ethnicity, having more education, working in health, social-care, or childcare professions, and having higher neuroticism, extroversion, openness to experience and agreeableness traits. Perspective taking was associated with younger age, female gender, more education, employment in health or social-care, neuroticism, openness, and agreeableness. Conclusions Empathic compassion and understanding are distinct dimensions of empathy with differential demographic associations. Perspective taking may decline due to cognitive inflexibility with older age whereas empathic concern increases in older men suggesting it is socially-driven."
https://openalex.org/W3200865359,"Aging of the population has led to an increase in the prevalence of cancer among older adults. In Japan, single agent chemotherapy was recommended for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for those, who were aged ≥75 years, while the Western guidelines did not recommend a specific regimen. In clinical practice, physicians are required to decide the treatment based on a lack of enough evidence. This study aimed to examine the prescribing patterns of first-line chemotherapy according to age in the real-world practice. Data from the survey database of Diagnostic Procedure Combination and hospital-based cancer registries of designated cancer centers nationwide were used. The first-line chemotherapy regimens among 9,737 patients who were diagnosed with advanced lung cancer between January and December 2013, were identified and compared based on age. We found that the proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy decreased with age; 80.0%, 70.4%, 50.6%, and 30.2% of patients aged 70–74, 75–79, 80–84, and ≥ 85 years, respectively, received chemotherapy. Among them, platinum doublets were prescribed for 62.7% of the patients who were aged ≥ 70 years, and 60.7% of the patients who were aged ≥ 75 years with no driver mutations in NSCLC; only 37.6% of them received single agents. Patients who were aged ≥ 80 years also preferred platinum doublets (35.6%). Carboplatin was commonly prescribed in all age groups; only 28.4% of those receiving platinum doublets selected cisplatin. In this study, platinum doublets were identified as the most commonly prescribed regimen in those who were aged ≥ 70 years. Despite recommendations of Japanese guidelines for NSCLC, 60.7% of those who were aged ≥75 years received platinum doublets. Additionally, patients who were aged ≥ 80 years also received systemic chemotherapy, including platinum doublets; age did not solely influence regimen selection."
https://openalex.org/W3201402523,"Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant global public health problem. Health care providers and medical students in developing countries including Ethiopia are at an increased risk of contracting HBV due to the high burden of this infection. The most effective way of prevention against HBV infection is vaccination of health care providers. However, there is a paucity of data on the HBV vaccination coverage among students of health science in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to determine HBV vaccination coverage and associated factors, level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards HBV among students of medicine and health science at Wolkite University. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at Wolkite University among 417 study participants from November to December 2020. The study participants were recruited by using a simple random sampling technique. Data were collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 21. A binary logistic regression model was used to determine the factors associated with full-dose vaccination status. Statistical significance was set at P-value &lt;0.05. Results Out of the 417 study participants, 5.8% (95%CI: 3.8–7.9) received a full-dose of the HBV vaccine in this study. Unavailability and high cost of the vaccine were frequently mentioned reasons for not being vaccinated against HBV. About 73.6%, 36.2%, and 47% of participants had good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices towards HBV, respectively. Being male gender (AOR: 8.8; 95%CI: 2.9–27), rural residence (AOR: 3.6; 95%CI:1.2–10.6), positive attitude (AOR: 0.44; 95%CI: 0.1–1.1), good practice (AOR: 0.17; 95%CI: 0.05–0.5), medicine department (AOR: 5.9; 95%CI: 1.2–29), being second-year student (AOR: 11.7; 95%CI: 2.7–50.9), third-year student (AOR: 19; 95%CI: 4.25–45), and fourth-year student (AOR: 27; 95%CI: 5.8–56) were significantly associated factors with full-dose vaccination status. Conclusion Our study revealed that only small proportions (5.8%) of study participants received full-dose HBV vaccination. Vaccinations of students before starting clinical attachments, provisions of training for students on infection prevention mechanism and universal precautions particularly on HBV, increasing the uptake of the HBV vaccine, creating awareness on attitude and practice of students towards HBV to enhance uptake of the vaccine are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3198962395,"Malnutrition is one of the most devastating problems in Ethiopia and is inextricably linked with poverty. Women in the reproductive age group and children are most vulnerable to malnutrition due to low dietary intakes, inequitable distribution of food within the household, improper food storage and preparation, dietary taboos, infectious diseases, and care. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the spatial distribution and determinants of undernutrition among reproductive age of Ethiopia.The study was based on the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey. The study included a total sampled weight of 15,139 women aged 15-49 years. The ArcGIS version 10.7 and SaTScan version 9.6 statistical software were used for exploring the spatial distribution of undernutrition. A multilevel logistic regression model was fitted to determine the individual and community level factors associated with women undernutrition. Finally, the factors which were significant at 95% confidence interval were reported.The spatial analysis revealed that women undernutrition was significantly varied across the country. The SaTScan analysis identified a total of 144 significant hotspot areas of maternal undernutrition with three significant spatial windows. Of these, 134 clusters were primary. The primary spatial window was identified in the southeast Tigray, northwest Afar, central and north Amhara regions (LLR = 57.48, P<0.01, RR = 1.51). Age at first marriage (AOR = 1.57: CI 1.33, 1.99), middle wealth index (AOR = 3.15: CI 1.4, 6.97), rural residence (AOR = 2.82: CI 1.22, 6.52), being in Afar region, Tigray region and Harari region (AOR = 4.88: CI 1.71, 13.91), (AOR = 4.17: CI 1.57, 11.06) and (AOR = 3.01: CI 1.05, 8.68) respectively were significantly associated with women undernutrition.In Ethiopia, undernutrition had significant spatial variations across the country. Residence, age at first marriage, wealth index and region were significantly associated with undernutrition. Therefore, public health interventions that reduce reproductive age women undernutrition and enhance women awareness towards undernutrition in hotspot areas of undernutrition is crucial."
https://openalex.org/W3200100654,"Inflammation contributes to knee osteoarthritis (KOA) where many immunological mediators participate in its initiation and progression. Most clinicians manage primary (pKOA) and secondary osteoarthritis (sKOA) alike. Whether immunological profiles of pKOA and sKOA differ remains obscure. Hence, we aimed to differentially identify potential serum immunologic diagnostic markers of pKOA and of sKOA. This case control study used 46 KOA patients (pKOA, n = 30; sKOA, n = 16), and 60 age, gender matched controls (normal healthy, n = 30; systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE] disease controls, n = 30) where serum was assayed for cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10) and nitric oxide derivatives (NOx). Sandwich ELISA assessed cytokine levels, while the ‘Griess assay’ quantified NOx levels. The diagnostic accuracy of optimal marker combinations was evaluated by the CombiROC web tool. Compared with pKOA, sKOA serum displayed significantly elevated levels of pro inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) with a concurrent decrease in the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 (P&lt;0.05). This was reiterated by significantly higher Th1:Th2 (TNF-α: IL-10) serum cytokine ratio observed in sKOA compared to that of pKOA. The CombiROC curves identified TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and NOx as the best performing panel of potential diagnostic markers to discriminate pKOA from control groups (~97% accuracy, 90% Sensitivity [SE] and 98% specificity [SP]), while TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 discriminated sKOA from control groups (~100% accuracy, 100% SE, and 98% SP). The study identified discrete serum immune biomarker panels to differentiate between pKOA (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and NOx) and sKOA (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6). These findings may assist in developing distinct therapeutic agents for the two types of KOA."
https://openalex.org/W3201060420,"Disruption of lipolysis has widespread effects on intermediary metabolism and organismal phenotypes. Defects in lipolysis can be modeled in Drosophila melanogaster through genetic manipulations of brummer (bmm), which encodes a triglyceride lipase orthologous to mammalian Adipose Triglyceride Lipase. RNAi-mediated knock-down of bmm in all tissues or metabolic specific tissues results in reduced locomotor activity, altered sleep patterns and reduced lifespan. Metabolomic analysis on flies in which bmm is downregulated reveals a marked reduction in medium chain fatty acids, long chain saturated fatty acids and long chain monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and an increase in diacylglycerol levels. Elevated carbohydrate metabolites and tricarboxylic acid intermediates indicate that impairment of fatty acid mobilization as an energy source may result in upregulation of compensatory carbohydrate catabolism. bmm downregulation also results in elevated levels of serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitters, possibly accounting for the impairment of locomotor activity and sleep patterns. Physiological phenotypes and metabolomic changes upon reduction of bmm expression show extensive sexual dimorphism. Altered metabolic states in the Drosophila model are relevant for understanding human metabolic disorders, since pathways of intermediary metabolism are conserved across phyla."
https://openalex.org/W3200966033,"This paper analyses COVID-19 patients' dynamics during the first wave in the region of Castilla y León (Spain) with around 2.4 million inhabitants using multi-state competing risk survival models. From the date registered as the start of the clinical process, it is assumed that a patient can progress through three intermediate states until reaching an absorbing state of recovery or death. Demographic characteristics, epidemiological factors such as the time of infection and previous vaccinations, clinical history, complications during the course of the disease and drug therapy for hospitalised patients are considered as candidate predictors. Regarding risk factors associated with mortality and severity, consistent results with many other studies have been found, such as older age, being male, and chronic diseases. Specifically, the hospitalisation (death) rate for those over 69 is 27.2% (19.8%) versus 5.3% (0.7%) for those under 70, and for males is 14.5%(7%) versus 8.3%(4.6%)for females. Among patients with chronic diseases the highest rates of hospitalisation are 26.1% for diabetes and 26.3% for kidney disease, while the highest death rate is 21.9% for cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, specific predictors for different transitions are given, and estimates of the probability of recovery and death for each patient are provided by the model. Some interesting results obtained are that for patients infected at the end of the period the hazard of transition from hospitalisation to ICU is significatively lower (p < 0.001) and the hazard of transition from hospitalisation to recovery is higher (p < 0.001). For patients previously vaccinated against pneumococcus the hazard of transition to recovery is higher (p < 0.001). Finally, internal validation and calibration of the model are also performed."
https://openalex.org/W3201023548,"The destinations of Thoroughbred (TB) racehorses exiting the racing industry is a high-profile issue with ethical and welfare implications of interest to both animal welfare groups and racing regulators. This cross-sectional study investigated the reasons that TBs temporarily or permanently exited racing and training in Australia in the 2017–2018 racing season and the outcomes for these horses post-racing. An online questionnaire was sent to the last registered trainers of a representative sample of 2,509 ‘inactive’ TBs. Inactive horses were defined as those horses that were recorded as ‘active’ but had not trialled or raced in the last 6 months of the racing season or had an inactive status recorded in the Racing Australia database. Of the 1,750 responses received, the largest group of inactive TBs had permanently exited the racing industry (45% retired, 5.3% deceased). A relatively large group exited racing temporarily (43%) but participated in the racing industry in the following season. The reasons for retirement were predominantly voluntary, such as poor performance or owner’s request. Almost one third of retirements were due to injuries with tendon or ligament problems the most frequently conditions listed. The median age at retirement was five (Q1 4; Q3 7) years. Extrapolation of the survey results to the population of horses racing or training in Australia in 2017–2018 ( n = 37,750) show that that 17% of the population retire each year and 2.1% die. These estimates provide benchmarks for industry and animal welfare organisations to resource and measure the effectiveness of interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3201257220,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurocognitive disorder identified by memory loss and a significant cognitive decline based on previous level of performance in one or more cognitive domains that interferes in the independence of everyday activities. The accuracy of imaging helps to identify the neuropathological features that differentiate AD from its common precursor, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Identification of early signs will aid in risk stratification of disease and ensures proper management is instituted to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with AD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using structural MRI (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) performed alone is inadequate. Thus, the combination of multiparametric MRI is proposed to increase the accuracy of diagnosing MCI and AD when compared to elderly healthy controls.This protocol describes a non-interventional case control study. The AD and MCI patients and the healthy elderly controls will undergo multi-parametric MRI. The protocol consists of sMRI, fMRI, DTI, and single-voxel proton MRS sequences. An eco-planar imaging (EPI) will be used to perform resting-state fMRI sequence. The structural images will be analysed using Computational Anatomy Toolbox-12, functional images will be analysed using Statistical Parametric Mapping-12, DPABI (Data Processing & Analysis for Brain Imaging), and Conn software, while DTI and 1H-MRS will be analysed using the FSL (FMRIB's Software Library) and Tarquin respectively. Correlation of the MRI results and the data acquired from the APOE genotyping, neuropsychological evaluations (i.e. Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA], and Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] scores) will be performed. The imaging results will also be correlated with the sociodemographic factors. The diagnosis of AD and MCI will be standardized and based on the DSM-5 criteria and the neuropsychological scores.The combination of sMRI, fMRI, DTI, and MRS sequences can provide information on the anatomical and functional changes in the brain such as regional grey matter volume atrophy, impaired functional connectivity among brain regions, and decreased metabolite levels specifically at the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. The combination of multiparametric MRI sequences can be used to stratify the management of MCI and AD patients. Accurate imaging can decide on the frequency of follow-up at memory clinics and select classifiers for machine learning that may aid in the disease identification and prognostication. Reliable and consistent quantification, using standardised protocols, are crucial to establish an optimal diagnostic capability in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease."

The role of viruses in cancer is typically to initiate cellular transformation through cellular DNA damage, although specific mechanisms remain unknown. Silent and long-term viral infections need to be present, in order to initiate cancer disease. In efforts to establish a causative role of viruses, first is needed to demonstrate the strength and consistency of associations in different populations. The aim of this study was to determine the association of bovine leukemia virus (BLV), a causative agent of leukemia in cattle, with breast cancer and its biomarkers used as prognosis of the severity of the disease (Ki67, HER2, hormonal receptors) in Colombian women. An unmatched, observational case–control study was conducted among women undergoing breast surgery between 2016–2018. Malignant samples (n = 75) were considered as cases and benign samples (n = 83) as controls. Nested-liquid PCR, in-situ PCR and immunohistochemistry were used for viral detection in blood and breast tissues. For the risk assessment, only BLV positive samples from breast tissues were included in the analysis. BLV was higher in cases group (61.3%) compared with controls (48.2%), with a statistically significant association between the virus and breast cancer in the unconditional logistic regression (adjusted-OR = 2.450,95%CI:1.088–5.517, p = 0.031). In this study, BLV was found in both blood and breast tissues of participants and an association between breast cancer and the virus was confirmed in Colombia, as an intermediate risk factor."
https://openalex.org/W3162114132,"In Gabon, the proportion of maternal deaths directly related to Primary PostPartum Haemorrhage (PPPH) is 15 to 25%, despite the different means that the World Health Organization has made available to the providers of Emergency Obstetrical and Neonatal Care (EmONC). The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of Primary PostPartum Haemorrhage to improve its management and reduce the rate of maternal deaths. An analytical retrospective study involved 42,728 records, whose data were collected using a chart collection form on the basis of information contained in partograms and other patient records. Sociodemographic variables were expressed using percentage. The relationship between the etiologies of PPPH and certain characteristics of the women was established using the ORs with their 95% confidence intervals. The difference was significant if p &lt; 0.05. The prevalence of PPPH was 1.6%. Delivery haemorrhages accounted for 65.5% of PPPH. The main factors associated with delivery haemorrhages were pauci parity and multiparity (p = 0.003 and 0.051), post-term (p = 0.042), and birth weight &gt;4,000 g (p = 0.006). Those associated with genital tract injuries were young maternal age (p = 0.008) and multiparity (p = 0.028). The most common etiology was haemorrhage from delivery. Multiparity remains the most common risk factor and the young age of the patients. It is important to improve management through better assessment of blood loss in the primary postpartum period as well as capacity building of health providers on EmONC."
https://openalex.org/W3199451552,"A new line of treatment for premature ejaculation (PE) based on the use of masturbation aid device in combination with behavioral techniques has emerged in recent years. We report a multicenter randomized clinical trial with a parallel group design to determine the effectiveness of an electronic device called Myhixel I© in the treatment of PE. Forty patients who met the criteria for the diagnosis of lifelong PE, were assigned to two treatment groups completed the Sphincter control training (SCT) program in eight weeks. The only difference between groups was the use of the device. The main measure was the “fold increase” (FI) of the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT). The geometric means of IELT show, at the end of the treatment at week 8, a superiority of the device group. The mean FI 4.27 (SD 2.59) at the end of treatment for the device group was clearly higher than obtained in the previous clinical trial, in which a specific medical device was not used. No side effects were observed and it required little therapeutic input and no partner involvement. The SCT program in combination with the Myhixel I© is an effective treatment for PE."
https://openalex.org/W3200069430,"Introduction Previous work had shown that machine learning models can predict inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related hospitalizations and outpatient corticosteroid use based on patient demographic and laboratory data in a cohort of United States Veterans. This study aimed to replicate this modeling framework in a nationally representative cohort. Methods A retrospective cohort design using Optum Electronic Health Records (EHR) were used to identify IBD patients, with at least 12 months of follow-up between 2007 and 2018. IBD flare was defined as an inpatient/emergency visit with a diagnosis of IBD or an outpatient corticosteroid prescription for IBD. Predictors included demographic and laboratory data. Logistic regression and random forest (RF) models were used to predict IBD flare within 6 months of each visit. A 70% training and 30% validation approach was used. Results A total of 95,878 patients across 780,559 visits were identified. Of these, 22,245 (23.2%) patients had at least one IBD flare. Patients were predominantly White (87.7%) and female (57.1%), with a mean age of 48.0 years. The logistic regression model had an area under the receiver operating curve (AuROC) of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.65−0.66), sensitivity of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.68−0.70), and specificity of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.73−0.74) in the validation cohort. The RF model had an AuROC of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.80−0.81), sensitivity of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.73−0.74), and specificity of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.72−0.72) in the validation cohort. Important predictors of IBD flare in the RF model were the number of previous flares, age, potassium, and white blood cell count. Conclusion The machine learning modeling framework was replicated and results showed a similar predictive accuracy in a nationally representative cohort of IBD patients. This modeling framework could be embedded in routine practice as a tool to distinguish high-risk patients for disease activity."
https://openalex.org/W3200260728,"Previous studies found that metamemory beliefs dominate the font size effect on judgments of learning (JOLs). However, few studies have investigated whether beliefs about font size contribute to the font size effect in circumstances of multiple cues. The current study aims to fill this gap. Experiment 1 adopted a 2 (font size: 70 pt vs . 9 pt) * 2 (word frequency (WF): high vs . low) within-subjects design. The results showed that beliefs about font size did not mediate the font size effect on JOLs when multiple cues (font size and WF) were simultaneously provided. Experiment 2 further explored whether WF moderates the contribution of beliefs about font size to the font size effect, in which a 2 (font size: 70 pt v s. 9 pt, as a within-subjects factor) * 2 (WF: high vs . low, as a between-subjects factor) mixed design was used. The results showed that the contribution of beliefs about font size to the font size effect was present in a pure list of low-frequency words, but absent in a pure list of high-frequency words. Lastly, a meta-analysis showed evidence supporting the proposal that the contribution of beliefs about font size to the font size effect on JOLs is moderated by WF. Even though numerous studies suggested beliefs about font size play a dominant role in the font size effect on JOLs, the current study provides new evidence suggesting that such contribution is conditional. Theoretical implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3200557650,"Agriculturally important commercially managed pollinators including honey bees ( Apis mellifera L., 1758) and bumble bees ( Bombus impatiens Cresson, 1863) rely on the surrounding landscape to fulfill their dietary needs. A previous study in Europe demonstrated that managed honey bee foragers and unmanaged native bumble bee foragers are associated with different land uses. However, it is unclear how response to land use compares between managed honey bees and a managed native bumble bee species in the United States, where honey bees are an imported species. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no such direct comparisons of bee responses to land use have been made at the colony level. To better understand how two different social bees respond to variation in land use, we monitored the weights of A . mellifera and B . impatiens colonies placed in 12 apiaries across a range of land use in Michigan, United States in 2017. Bombus impatiens colonies gained more weight and produced more drones when surrounded by diverse agricultural land (i.e., non-corn/soybean cropland such as tree fruits and grapes), while honey bee colonies gained more weight when surrounded by more grassland/pasture land. These findings add to our understanding of how different bee species respond to agricultural landscapes, highlighting the need for further species-specific land use studies to inform tailored land management."
https://openalex.org/W3201308538,"Background Thrombophilia workup is typically inappropriate in the inpatient setting as testing may be skewed by anticoagulation, acute thrombosis, or acute illness. Objective To determine adherence of inpatient thrombophilia testing with institutional guidelines. Patients and methods A retrospective study to evaluate thrombophilia testing practices of adult patients who were admitted to Lehigh Valley Hospital at Cedar Crest with either venous thromboembolism or ischemic stroke in 2019. Testing included inherited and acquired thrombophilia. Patient charts were individually reviewed for three measured outcomes: 1) the number of appropriate thrombophilia testing in the inpatient setting; 2) the indications used for thrombophilia testing; 3) the proportion of positive thrombophilia tests with change in clinical management. Results 201 patients were included in our study. 26 patients (13%) were tested appropriately in accordance with institution guidelines and 175 (87%) patients were tested inappropriately. The most common reason for the inappropriate testing was testing during acute thrombosis. 28 of the 201 patients had positive thrombophilia tests, but the reviewers only noted 7 patients with change in clinical management—involving anticoagulation change. Conclusion Our study revealed that a majority of inpatient thrombophilia testing did not follow institutional guidelines for appropriate testing and did not change patient management. These thrombophilia tests are often overutilized and have minimal clinical utility in the inpatient setting."
https://openalex.org/W3200186839,"In oncology research, while xenograft tumor models are easily visualized and humane endpoints can be clearly defined, metastatic tumor models are often based on more subjective clinical observations as endpoints. This study aimed at identifying objective non-invasive criteria for predicting imminent distress and mortality in metastatic lung tumor-bearing mice. BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with CT26 or B16F10 cells, respectively. The mice were housed in Vium smart cages to continuously monitor and stream respiratory rate and locomotion for up to 28 days until scheduled euthanasia or humane endpoint criteria were met. Body weight and body temperature were measured during the study. On days 11, 14, 17 and 28, lungs of subsets of animals were microCT imaged in vivo to assess lung metastasis progression and then euthanized for lung microscopic evaluations. Beginning at day 21, most tumor-bearing animals developed increased respiratory rates followed by decreased locomotion 1–2 days later, compared with the baseline values. Increases in respiratory rate did not correlate to surface tumor nodule counts or lung weight. Body weight measurement did not show significant changes from days 14–28 in either tumor-bearing or control animals. We propose that increases in respiratory rate (1.3–1.5 X) can be used to provide an objective benchmark to signal the need for increased clinical observations or euthanasia. Adoption of this novel humane endpoint criterion would allow investigators time to collect tissue samples prior to spontaneous morbidity or death and significantly reduce the distress of mice in the terminal stages of these metastatic lung tumor models."

The objective of this study is to explore cervical culture pathogens in women of different age groups in a medical center in eastern Taiwan. Methods We enrolled patients whose medical records were diagnosed with PID (ICD-9-CM 614.0 [N70.01–03], 614.1[N70.11–13], 614.9 [N73.5, N73.9]) at our hospital from October 2014 to March 2020. Patients were divided into three groups according to age: the age &lt;25 years, age 25–44 years, and the ≥ 45 years group. Chi-square test, ANOVA and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. In subgroup analysis, endocervical pathogens were further stratified into vaginal, respiratory, enteric, skin, oral, and other. Results A total of 96 patients were included in the study. There were 31 patients in the age ≥ 45 years group, 52 patients in the age 25–44 years group, and 13 patients in the age &lt;25 years group. Vagina and enteric pathogens were the most common pathogens among all groups. The isolated respiratory and other pathogens were more in the age ≥ 45 years group than in the other two groups. Prevotella bivia was more common in the age &lt;25 years and 25–44 years groups. Conclusions This may be due to different pathogeneses of PID in the age ≥ 45 years patients. Our study can be used as a reference for antibiotic choice of non-sexually transmitted PID and to prevent long-term sequelae of PID."
https://openalex.org/W3200344157,"Objectives The general anesthetic sevoflurane is being repurposed as a topical analgesic for painful chronic wounds. We conducted a Bayesian cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) comparing the addition of domiciliary topical sevoflurane to conventional analgesics (SEVOFLURANE, n = 38) versus conventional analgesics alone (CONVENTIONAL, n = 26) for the treatment of nonrevascularizable painful leg ulcers in an outpatient Pain Clinic of a Spanish tertiary hospital. Methods We used real-world data collected from charts to conduct this CEA from a public healthcare perspective and with a one-year time horizon. Costs of analgesics, visits and admissions were considered, expressed in €2016. Analgesic effectiveness was measured with SPID (Sum of Pain Intensity Difference). A Bayesian regression model was constructed, including “treatment” and baseline characteristics for patients (“arterial hypertension”) and ulcers (“duration”, “number”, “depth”, “pain”) as covariates. The findings were summarized as a cost-effectiveness plane and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. One-way sensitivity analyses, a re-analysis excluding those patients who died or suffered from leg amputation, and an extreme scenario analysis were conducted to reduce uncertainty. Results Compared to CONVENTIONAL, SEVOFLURANE was associated with a 46% reduction in costs, and the mean incremental effectiveness (28.15±3.70 effectiveness units) was favorable to SEVOFLURANE. The estimated probability for SEVOFLURANE being dominant was 99%. The regression model showed that costs were barely influenced by any covariate, whereas effectiveness was noticeably influenced by “treatment”. All sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the model, even in the extreme scenario analysis against SEVOFLURANE. Conclusions SEVOFLURANE was dominant over CONVENTIONAL as it was less expensive and much more effective."
https://openalex.org/W3200519126,"Despite the development and success of cochlear implants over several decades, wide inter-subject variability in speech perception is reported. This suggests that cochlear implant user-dependent factors limit speech perception at the individual level. Clinical studies have demonstrated the importance of the number, placement, and insertion depths of electrodes on speech recognition abilities. However, these do not account for all inter-subject variability and to what extent these factors affect speech recognition abilities has not been studied. In this paper, an information theoretic method and machine learning technique are unified in a model to investigate the extent to which key factors limit cochlear implant electrode discrimination. The framework uses a neural network classifier to predict which electrode is stimulated for a given simulated activation pattern of the auditory nerve, and mutual information is then estimated between the actual stimulated electrode and predicted ones. We also investigate how and to what extent the choices of parameters affect the performance of the model. The advantages of this framework include i) electrode discrimination ability is quantified using information theory, ii) it provides a flexible framework that may be used to investigate the key factors that limit the performance of cochlear implant users, and iii) it provides insights for future modeling studies of other types of neural prostheses."
https://openalex.org/W3201259246,"Invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) pose a serious threat to marine ecosystems throughout the western Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The development of a fishery for lionfish has been proposed as a strategy for controlling populations; however, there is concern about consumption of this species by humans due to its high trophic position and potential for bioaccumulation of mercury. We analyzed total mercury (THg) in tissues of lionfish from two locations on the east coast of Florida. THg in lionfish increased with size and differed by location and sex. THg was highest in muscle tissue and was strongly positively correlated among tissues. THg in lionfish was lower than other commonly consumed marine fishes, and falls into Florida's least restrictive advisory level. Consumption of lionfish poses a low risk and concerns over mercury bioaccumulation should not present a significant barrier to lionfish harvest."
https://openalex.org/W3201492755,"Objectives To determine whether veterinarians in primary care practices (PCPs) and board-certified clinicians (BCCs) approach treatment of dogs with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) similarly, and whether practitioners with more experience treat similarly to those with less experience. We hypothesised those in PCPs would show more variation in their approach to similar cases than BCCs. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing a questionnaire to BCCs and veterinarians in PCPs. The questionnaire included direct questions and a number of clinical scenarios intended to capture approaches to common treatment problems. Results Questionnaire responses were received from 241 veterinarians, including 216 in PCPs and 25 BCCs. Veterinarians in both settings used similar tests for diagnosis of IMHA, but BCCs performed more tests to exclude underlying causes of ‘associative’ disease. All veterinarians reported use of similar initial dosages of glucocorticoids (median 2 mg/kg per day in both groups, p = 0.92) but those used by more experienced practitioners were higher than those with less experience. Most veterinarians made allowances for the weight of dogs, using lower prednisolone dosages in a clinical scenario involving a 40 kg dog compared to a 9 kg dog ( p = 0.025 for PCP, p = 0.002 for BCC). BCCs reported greater use of combinations of immunosuppressive drugs ( p &lt;0.0001) and of antithrombotic drugs ( p &lt;0.0001); use of antithrombotic drugs was also less common among more experienced practitioners compared to less experienced. Conclusions Approaches to treatment of dogs with IMHA differ between BCCs and those in PCP. These differences may affect design and implementation of future research studies and clinical guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W3199075480,"The histone chaperone Spt6 is involved in promoting elongation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), maintaining chromatin structure, regulating cotranscriptional histone modifications, and controlling mRNA processing. These diverse functions of Spt6 are partly mediated through its interactions with RNAPII and other factors in the transcription elongation complex. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to characterize the differences in RNAPII-interacting factors between wildtype cells and those depleted for Spt6, leading to the identification of proteins that depend on Spt6 for their interaction with RNAPII. The altered association of some of these factors could be attributed to changes in steady-state protein levels. However, Abd1, the mRNA cap methyltransferase, had decreased association with RNAPII after Spt6 depletion despite unchanged Abd1 protein levels, showing a requirement for Spt6 in mediating the Abd1-RNAPII interaction. Genome-wide studies showed that Spt6 is required for maintaining the level of Abd1 over transcribed regions, as well as the level of Spt5, another protein known to recruit Abd1 to chromatin. Abd1 levels were particularly decreased at the 5' ends of genes after Spt6 depletion, suggesting a greater need for Spt6 in Abd1 recruitment over these regions. Together, our results show that Spt6 is important in regulating the composition of the transcription elongation complex and reveal a previously unknown function for Spt6 in the recruitment of Abd1."
https://openalex.org/W3199983477,"We study how social preferences and norms of reciprocity are related to generalized (outgroup) and particularized (ingroup) trust among members of youth business groups in northern Ethiopia. The Ethiopian government promotes youth employment among land-poor rural youth by allocating them rehabilitated communal lands for the formation of sustainable businesses. The typical sustainable production activities that the groups can invest in include apiculture, forestry, horticulture, and livestock production. Our study used incentivized experiments to elicit social preferences, trust, and trustworthiness. We use data from 2427 group members in 246 functioning business groups collected in 2019. Altruistic and egalitarian preferences were associated with stronger norms to reciprocate, higher outgroup and ingroup trustworthiness and trust while spiteful and selfish preferences had opposite effects. The social preferences had both direct and indirect effects (through the norm to reciprocate) on trustworthiness and trust. Ingroup trust was positively correlated with a number of group performance indicators."
https://openalex.org/W3200130109,"To mitigate the health risks that result from low health literacy and difficulty identifying patients with insufficient health literacy, health organizations recommend physicians apply health literacy universal precaution communication skills when communicating with all patients. Our aim was to assess how health literacy universal precautions are delivered in routine GP consultations, and explore whether there were differences in how GPs used universal precaution approaches according to areas of deprivation in England.This was a mixed methods study using video and interview data. Ten physicians conducted 217 consultations in primary care settings with adults over 50 years old between July 2017 and March 2018 in England. Eighty consultations (N = 80) met the inclusion criteria of new or persisting problems. Descriptive quantitative analysis of video-recorded consultations using an observation tool and qualitative thematic analysis of transcribed scripts. Meta-themes explored differences in physicians' communication by areas of deprivation.Descriptive statistics showed physicians used a caring tone of voice and attitude (n = 73, 91.3%) and displayed comfortable body language (n = 69, 86.3%) but infrequently demonstrated profession-specific health literacy universal precaution communication skills, such as the teach-back technique (n = 3, 3.8%). Inferences about physicians' communication from qualitative analysis converged with the quantitative findings. Differences in physicians' communication varied according to areas of deprivation.Physicians need health literacy universal precautions communication skills to improve population health."
https://openalex.org/W3201129506,"The purpose of the present study was to reveal the relationship between degenerative changes in the cervical spine, head and neck postures, neck pain, and bone mineral density (BMD) of the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine in post-menopausal females. In total, 116 females (mean age 60.4 ± 7.1 years; age range 50–80 years) were included. Participants were classified into three groups based on the T-score criteria of the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine set by World Health Organization, respectively. The degree of neck pain was assessed using self-administered questionnaire, the Neck Disability Index. Cervical spine degeneration and head and neck postures were identified using the lateral cephalograms. Grading system for cervical degeneration included three categories of the radiographic alterations including disc height loss, osteophyte formation, and diffuse sclerosis. The areal BMD of the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine were determined using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Females with lower BMD exhibited lesser degree of neck pain and forward head posture (FHP) compared to those with normal BMD. Higher BMD seemed to be associated with more notable loss of the disc height at the level of C4-5. More prominent degenerative changes in the cervical spine were associated with higher areal BMD of the hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine, altered head posture, and development of neck pain."
https://openalex.org/W3199888283,"Named entity recognition (NER) is one fundamental task in the natural language processing (NLP) community. Supervised neural network models based on contextualized word representations can achieve highly-competitive performance, which requires a large-scale manually-annotated corpus for training. While for the resource-scarce languages, the construction of such as corpus is always expensive and time-consuming. Thus, unsupervised cross-lingual transfer is one good solution to address the problem. In this work, we investigate the unsupervised cross-lingual NER with model transfer based on contextualized word representations, which greatly advances the cross-lingual NER performance. We study several model transfer settings of the unsupervised cross-lingual NER, including (1) different types of the pretrained transformer-based language models as input, (2) the exploration strategies of the multilingual contextualized word representations, and (3) multi-source adaption. In particular, we propose an adapter-based word representation method combining with parameter generation network (PGN) better to capture the relationship between the source and target languages. We conduct experiments on a benchmark ConLL dataset involving four languages to simulate the cross-lingual setting. Results show that we can obtain highly-competitive performance by cross-lingual model transfer. In particular, our proposed adapter-based PGN model can lead to significant improvements for cross-lingual NER."
