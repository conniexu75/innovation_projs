https://openalex.org/W4295088938,"Climate tipping points occur when change in a part of the climate system becomes self-perpetuating beyond a warming threshold, leading to substantial Earth system impacts. Synthesizing paleoclimate, observational, and model-based studies, we provide a revised shortlist of global “core” tipping elements and regional “impact” tipping elements and their temperature thresholds. Current global warming of ~1.1°C above preindustrial temperatures already lies within the lower end of some tipping point uncertainty ranges. Several tipping points may be triggered in the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to &lt;2°C global warming, with many more likely at the 2 to 3°C of warming expected on current policy trajectories. This strengthens the evidence base for urgent action to mitigate climate change and to develop improved tipping point risk assessment, early warning capability, and adaptation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4295087972,"Ultracompact sources of circularly polarized light are important for classical and quantum optical information processing. Conventional approaches for generating chiral emission are restricted to excitation power ranges and fail to provide high-quality radiation with perfect polarization conversion. We used the physics of chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum to demonstrate the efficient and controllable emission of circularly polarized light from resonant metasurfaces. Exploiting intrinsic chirality and giant field enhancement, we revealed how to simultaneously modify and control spectra, radiation patterns, and spin angular momentum of photoluminescence and lasing without any spin injection. The superior characteristics of chiral emission and lasing promise multiple applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics."
https://openalex.org/W4295083689,"Colloidal lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are of interest as photoluminescent quantum dots (QDs) whose properties depend on the size and shape. They are normally synthesized on subsecond time scales through hard-to-control ionic metathesis reactions. We report a room-temperature synthesis of monodisperse, isolable, spheroidal APbBr 3 QDs (“A” indicates cesium, formamidinium, and methylammonium) that are size tunable from 3 to &gt;13 nanometers. The kinetics of both nucleation and growth are temporally separated and substantially slowed down by the intricate equilibrium between the precursor (PbBr 2 ) and the A[PbBr 3 ] solute, with the latter serving as a monomer. QDs of all these compositions exhibit up to four excitonic transitions in their linear absorption spectra, and we demonstrate that the size-dependent confinement energy for all transitions is independent of the A-site cation."
https://openalex.org/W4295079176,"Exoplanets smaller than Neptune are common around red dwarf stars (M dwarfs), with those that transit their host star constituting the bulk of known temperate worlds amenable for atmospheric characterization. We analyze the masses and radii of all known small transiting planets around M dwarfs, identifying three populations: rocky, water-rich, and gas-rich. Our results are inconsistent with the previously known bimodal radius distribution arising from atmospheric loss of a hydrogen/helium envelope. Instead, we propose that a density gap separates rocky from water-rich exoplanets. Formation models that include orbital migration can explain the observations: Rocky planets form within the snow line, whereas water-rich worlds form outside it and later migrate inward."
https://openalex.org/W4295086866,"Neanderthal brains were similar in size to those of modern humans. We sought to investigate potential differences in neurogenesis during neocortex development. Modern human transketolase-like 1 (TKTL1) differs from Neanderthal TKTL1 by a lysine-to-arginine amino acid substitution. Using overexpression in developing mouse and ferret neocortex, knockout in fetal human neocortical tissue, and genome-edited cerebral organoids, we found that the modern human variant, hTKTL1, but not the Neanderthal variant, increases the abundance of basal radial glia (bRG) but not that of intermediate progenitors (bIPs). bRG generate more neocortical neurons than bIPs. The hTKTL1 effect requires the pentose phosphate pathway and fatty acid synthesis. Inhibition of these metabolic pathways reduces bRG abundance in fetal human neocortical tissue. Our data suggest that neocortical neurogenesis in modern humans differs from that in Neanderthals."
https://openalex.org/W4295088023,"Highly efficient halide perovskite solar cells generally rely on lithium-doped organic hole transporting layers that are thermally and chemically unstable, in part because of migration of iodide anions from the perovskite layer. We report a solution strategy to stabilize the hole transport in organic layers by ionic coupling positive polymer radicals and molecular anions through an ion-exchange process. The target layer exhibited a hole conductivity that was 80 times higher than that of the conventional lithium-doped layer. Moreover, after extreme iodide invasion caused by light-soaking at 85°C for 200 hours, the target layer maintained high hole conductivity and well-matched band alignment. This ion-exchange strategy enabled fabrication of perovskite solar cells with a certified power conversion efficiency of 23.9% that maintained 92% under standard illumination at 85°C after 1000 hours."

https://openalex.org/W4295084880,"There has been substantial research on adult COVID-19 and how to treat it. But how do severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections afflict children? The COVID-19 pandemic has yielded many surprises, not least that children generally develop less severe disease than older adults, which is unusual for a respiratory disease. However, some children can develop serious complications from COVID-19, such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and Long Covid, even after mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. Why this occurs in some and not others is an important question. Moreover, when children do contract COVID-19, understanding their role in transmission, especially in schools and at home, is crucial to ensuring effective mitigation measures. Therefore, in addition to nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as improved ventilation, there is a strong case to vaccinate children so as to reduce possible long-term effects from infection and to decrease transmission. But questions remain about whether vaccination might skew immune responses to variants in the long term. As the experts discuss below, more is being learned about these important issues, but much more research is needed to understand the long-term effects of COVID-19 in children."
https://openalex.org/W4294904488,"The potential of mitigation actions to limit global warming within 2 °C (ref. 1) might rely on the abundant supply of biomass for large-scale bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) that is assumed to scale up markedly in the future2-5. However, the detrimental effects of climate change on crop yields may reduce the capacity of BECCS and threaten food security6-8, thus creating an unrecognized positive feedback loop on global warming. We quantified the strength of this feedback by implementing the responses of crop yields to increases in growing-season temperature, atmospheric CO2 concentration and intensity of nitrogen (N) fertilization in a compact Earth system model9. Exceeding a threshold of climate change would cause transformative changes in social-ecological systems by jeopardizing climate stability and threatening food security. If global mitigation alongside large-scale BECCS is delayed to 2060 when global warming exceeds about 2.5 °C, then the yields of agricultural residues for BECCS would be too low to meet the Paris goal of 2 °C by 2200. This risk of failure is amplified by the sustained demand for food, leading to an expansion of cropland or intensification of N fertilization to compensate for climate-induced yield losses. Our findings thereby reinforce the urgency of early mitigation, preferably by 2040, to avoid irreversible climate change and serious food crises unless other negative-emission technologies become available in the near future to compensate for the reduced capacity of BECCS."
https://openalex.org/W4294990652,"While acetylated, RNA-binding-deficient TDP-43 reversibly phase separates within nuclei into complex droplets (anisosomes) comprised of TDP-43-containing liquid outer shells and liquid centres of HSP70-family chaperones, cytoplasmic aggregates of TDP-43 are hallmarks of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here we show that transient oxidative stress, proteasome inhibition or inhibition of the ATP-dependent chaperone activity of HSP70 provokes reversible cytoplasmic TDP-43 de-mixing and transition from liquid to gel/solid, independently of RNA binding or stress granules. Isotope labelling mass spectrometry was used to identify that phase-separated cytoplasmic TDP-43 is bound by the small heat-shock protein HSPB1. Binding is direct, mediated through TDP-43's RNA binding and low-complexity domains. HSPB1 partitions into TDP-43 droplets, inhibits TDP-43 assembly into fibrils, and is essential for disassembly of stress-induced TDP-43 droplets. A decrease in HSPB1 promotes cytoplasmic TDP-43 de-mixing and mislocalization. HSPB1 depletion was identified in spinal motor neurons of patients with ALS containing aggregated TDP-43. These findings identify HSPB1 to be a regulator of cytoplasmic TDP-43 phase separation and aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W4294993029,"Despite the availability of Cas9 variants with varied protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) compatibilities, some genomic loci-especially those with pyrimidine-rich PAM sequences-remain inaccessible by high-activity Cas9 proteins. Moreover, broadening PAM sequence compatibility through engineering can increase off-target activity. With directed evolution, we generated four Cas9 variants that together enable targeting of most pyrimidine-rich PAM sequences in the human genome. Using phage-assisted noncontinuous evolution and eVOLVER-supported phage-assisted continuous evolution, we evolved Nme2Cas9, a compact Cas9 variant, into variants that recognize single-nucleotide pyrimidine-PAM sequences. We developed a general selection strategy that requires functional editing with fully specified target protospacers and PAMs. We applied this selection to evolve high-activity variants eNme2-T.1, eNme2-T.2, eNme2-C and eNme2-C.NR. Variants eNme2-T.1 and eNme2-T.2 offer access to N4TN PAM sequences with comparable editing efficiencies as existing variants, while eNme2-C and eNme2-C.NR offer less restrictive PAM requirements, comparable or higher activity in a variety of human cell types and lower off-target activity at N4CN PAM sequences."
https://openalex.org/W4295088137,"Mammalian cells can generate amino acids through macropinocytosis and lysosomal breakdown of extracellular proteins, which is exploited by cancer cells to grow in nutrient-poor tumors. Through genetic screens in defined nutrient conditions, we characterized LYSET, a transmembrane protein (TMEM251) selectively required when cells consume extracellular proteins. LYSET was found to associate in the Golgi with GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, which targets catabolic enzymes to lysosomes through mannose-6-phosphate modification. Without LYSET, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase was unstable because of a hydrophilic transmembrane domain. Consequently, LYSET-deficient cells were depleted of lysosomal enzymes and impaired in turnover of macropinocytic and autophagic cargoes. Thus, LYSET represents a core component of the lysosomal enzyme trafficking pathway, underlies the pathomechanism for hereditary lysosomal storage disorders, and may represent a target to suppress metabolic adaptations in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4295079475,"Translational regulation plays a critical role during the oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET) and zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Here, we integrated ultra-low-input ribosome profiling (Ribo-lite) with messenger RNA sequencing to co-profile the translatome and transcriptome in human oocytes and early embryos. Comparison with mouse counterparts identified widespread differentially translated gene functioning in epigenetic reprogramming, transposon defense, and small RNA biogenesis, in part driven by species-specific regulatory elements in 3′ untranslated regions. Moreover, PRD-like homeobox transcription factors, including TPRXL , TPRX1 , and TPRX2 , are highly translated around ZGA. TPRX1/2/L knockdown leads to defective ZGA and preimplantation development. Ectopically expressed TPRXs bind and activate key ZGA genes in human embryonic stem cells. These data reveal the conservation and divergence of translation landscapes during OET and identify critical regulators of human ZGA."
https://openalex.org/W4295082316,"Lysosomes are key degradative compartments of the cell. Transport to lysosomes relies on GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase–mediated tagging of soluble enzymes with mannose 6-phosphate (M6P). GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase deficiency leads to the severe lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis II (MLII). Several viruses require lysosomal cathepsins to cleave structural proteins and thus depend on functional GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. We used genome-scale CRISPR screens to identify lysosomal enzyme trafficking factor (LYSET, also named TMEM251) as essential for infection by cathepsin-dependent viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). LYSET deficiency resulted in global loss of M6P tagging and mislocalization of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase from the Golgi complex to lysosomes. Lyset knockout mice exhibited MLII-like phenotypes, and human pathogenic LYSET alleles failed to restore lysosomal sorting defects. Thus, LYSET is required for correct functioning of the M6P trafficking machinery and mutations in LYSET can explain the phenotype of the associated disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3213851472,"Electrical resistance usually originates from lattice imperfections. However, even a perfect lattice has a fundamental resistance limit, given by the Landauer conductance caused by a finite number of propagating electron modes. This resistance, shown by Sharvin to appear at the contacts of electronic devices, sets the ultimate conductance limit of non-interacting electrons. Recent years have seen growing evidence of hydrodynamic electronic phenomena, prompting recent theories to ask whether an electronic fluid can radically break the fundamental Landauer-Sharvin limit. Here, we use single-electron transistor imaging of electronic flow in high-mobility graphene Corbino disk devices to answer this question. First, by imaging ballistic flows at liquid-helium temperatures, we observe a Landauer-Sharvin resistance that does not appear at the contacts but is instead distributed throughout the bulk. This underpins the phase-space origin of this resistance - as emerging from spatial gradients in the number of conduction modes. At elevated temperatures, by identifying and accounting for electron-phonon scattering, we reveal the details of the purely hydrodynamic flow. Strikingly, we find that electron hydrodynamics eliminates the bulk Landuer-Sharvin resistance. Finally, by imaging spiraling magneto-hydrodynamic Corbino flows, we reveal the key emergent length scale predicted by hydrodynamic theories - the Gurzhi length. These observations demonstrate that electronic fluids can dramatically transcend the fundamental limitations of ballistic electrons, with important implications for fundamental science and future technologies"
https://openalex.org/W4294993132,"The analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma provides information on pathological processes in the body. Blood cfDNA is in the form of nucleosomes, which maintain their tissue- and cancer-specific epigenetic state. We developed a single-molecule multiparametric assay to comprehensively profile the epigenetics of plasma-isolated nucleosomes (EPINUC), DNA methylation and cancer-specific protein biomarkers. Our system allows for high-resolution detection of six active and repressive histone modifications and their ratios and combinatorial patterns on millions of individual nucleosomes by single-molecule imaging. In addition, our system provides sensitive and quantitative data on plasma proteins, including detection of non-secreted tumor-specific proteins, such as mutant p53. EPINUC analysis of a cohort of 63 colorectal cancer, 10 pancreatic cancer and 33 healthy plasma samples detected cancer with high accuracy and sensitivity, even at early stages. Finally, combining EPINUC with direct single-molecule DNA sequencing revealed the tissue of origin of colorectal, pancreatic, lung and breast tumors. EPINUC provides multilayered information of potential clinical relevance from limited (<1 ml) liquid biopsy material."
https://openalex.org/W4295079382,"Hydroformylation with unmodified cobalt carbonyl catalyst plays a crucial role in industrial production of surfactants and plasticizers. However, syngas pressures of 100 to 400 bar with reaction temperatures of 100° to 250°C are typically applied. We report here that unmodified cobalt carbonyl is a stable hydroformylation catalyst at 140°C under 30 bar of syngas. The activity was comparable to that of recently reported bisphosphine-coordinated cobalt(II) catalysts, which we could not reproduce under the reported conditions. Kinetic and in situ infrared spectroscopic studies confirmed the stability of the unmodified cobalt tetracarbonyl hydride [HCo(CO)4]. Branched internal olefins were converted to aldehydes with high regioselectivity under low syngas pressures without phosphorus ligands. Bisphosphines had a small promotional effect on the catalyst at phosphorus-to-cobalt loading ratios below 0.6."

They remain insufficiently studied despite globally expanding and providing key support to low- to middle-income communities. To elucidate their domestication history, we constructed a comprehensive genome panel of 207 modern and 31 ancient donkeys, as well as 15 wild equids. We found a strong phylogeographic structure in modern donkeys that supports a single domestication in Africa ~5000 BCE, followed by further expansions in this continent and Eurasia and ultimately returning to Africa. We uncover a previously unknown genetic lineage in the Levant ~200 BCE, which contributed increasing ancestry toward Asia. Donkey management involved inbreeding and the production of giant bloodlines at a time when mules were essential to the Roman economy and military."
https://openalex.org/W4294904337,"Nuclear fusion is one of the most attractive alternatives to carbon-dependent energy sources1. Harnessing energy from nuclear fusion in a large reactor scale, however, still presents many scientific challenges despite the many years of research and steady advances in magnetic confinement approaches. State-of-the-art magnetic fusion devices cannot yet achieve a sustainable fusion performance, which requires a high temperature above 100 million kelvin and sufficient control of instabilities to ensure steady-state operation on the order of tens of seconds2,3. Here we report experiments at the Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research4 device producing a plasma fusion regime that satisfies most of the above requirements: thanks to abundant fast ions stabilizing the core plasma turbulence, we generate plasmas at a temperature of 100 million kelvin lasting up to 20 seconds without plasma edge instabilities or impurity accumulation. A low plasma density combined with a moderate input power for operation is key to establishing this regime by preserving a high fraction of fast ions. This regime is rarely subject to disruption and can be sustained reliably even without a sophisticated control, and thus represents a promising path towards commercial fusion reactors. A magnetic confinement regime established at the Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research device enables the generation of plasmas over 108 kelvin for 20 seconds with the aid of fast ions without plasma edge instabilities or impurity accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W4295088909,"Parasites impose fitness costs on their hosts. Biologists often assume that natural selection favors infection-resistant hosts. Yet, when the immune response itself is costly, theory suggests that selection may sometimes favor loss of resistance, which may result in alternative stable states where some populations are resistant and others are tolerant. Intraspecific variation in immune costs is rarely surveyed in a manner that tests evolutionary patterns, and there are few examples of adaptive loss of resistance. Here, we show that when marine threespine stickleback colonized freshwater lakes, they gained resistance to the freshwater-associated cestode Schistocephalus solidus. Extensive peritoneal fibrosis and inflammation are a commonly observed phenotype that contributes to suppression of cestode growth and viability but also imposes a substantial cost on fecundity. Combining genetic mapping and population genomics, we find that opposing selection generates immune system differences between tolerant and resistant populations, consistent with divergent optimization."

https://openalex.org/W4295084598,"Abstract Coordinated changes of cellular plasticity and identity are critical for pluripotent reprogramming and oncogenic transformation. However, the sequences of events that orchestrate these intermingled modifications have never been comparatively dissected. Here, we deconvolute the cellular trajectories of reprogramming (via Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/c-Myc) and transformation (via Ras/c-Myc) at the single-cell resolution and reveal how the two processes intersect before they bifurcate. This approach led us to identify the transcription factor Bcl11b as a broad-range regulator of cell fate changes, as well as a pertinent marker to capture early cellular intermediates that emerge simultaneously during reprogramming and transformation. Multiomics characterization of these intermediates unveiled a c-Myc/Atoh8/Sfrp1 regulatory axis that constrains reprogramming, transformation and transdifferentiation. Mechanistically, we found that Atoh8 restrains cellular plasticity, independent of cellular identity, by binding a specific enhancer network. This study provides insights into the partitioned control of cellular plasticity and identity for both regenerative and cancer biology."
https://openalex.org/W4225789402,The quantitative description of correlated electron materials remains a modern computational challenge. We demonstrate a numerical strategy to simulate correlated materials at the fully ab initio level beyond the solution of effective low-energy models and apply it to gain a detailed microscopic understanding across a family of cuprate superconducting materials in their parent undoped states. We uncover microscopic trends in the electron correlations and reveal the link between the material composition and magnetic energy scales through a many-body picture of excitation processes involving the buffer layers. Our work illustrates a path toward a quantitative and reliable understanding of more complex states of correlated materials at the ab initio many-body level.

https://openalex.org/W3212129494,"The topological order of a quantum Hall state is mirrored by the gapless edge modes owing to bulk-edge correspondence. The state at the filling of ν = 5/2, predicted to host non-abelian anyons, supports a variety of edge modes (integer, fractional, neutral). To ensure thermal equilibration between the edge modes and thus accurately determine the state's nature, it is advantageous to isolate the fractional channel (1/2 and neutral modes). In this study, we gapped out the integer modes by interfacing the ν = 5/2 state with integer states ν = 2 and ν = 3 and measured the thermal conductance of the isolated-interface channel. Our measured half-quantized thermal conductance confirms the non-abelian nature of the ν = 5/2 state and its particle-hole Pfaffian topological order. Such an isolated channel may be more amenable to braiding experiments."
https://openalex.org/W4294993093,"Omicron and its subvariants have rendered most authorized monoclonal antibody-based treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ineffective, highlighting the need for biologics capable of overcoming SARS-CoV-2 evolution. These mostly ineffective antibodies target variable epitopes. Here we describe broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors developed by tethering the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to known non-neutralizing antibodies that target highly conserved epitopes in the viral spike protein. These inhibitors, called receptor-blocking conserved non-neutralizing antibodies (ReconnAbs), potently neutralize all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), including Omicron. Neutralization potency is lost when the linker joining the binding and inhibitory ReconnAb components is severed. In addition, a bi-functional ReconnAb, made by linking ACE2 to a bi-specific antibody targeting two non-overlapping conserved epitopes, defined here, shows sub-nanomolar neutralizing activity against all VOCs, including Omicron and BA.2. Given their conserved targets and modular nature, ReconnAbs have the potential to act as broad-spectrum therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging pandemic diseases."

https://openalex.org/W4294992497,"Neonicotinoid insecticides applied to flowering crops can have negative impacts on bees, with implications for crop pollination. To assess if exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin via a treated crop (rapeseed) affected bee behaviour, pollination performance (to strawberry), and bee reproduction, we provided each of 12 outdoor cages with rapeseed (autumn-sown plants complemented with a few spring-sown plants to extend the flowering period) grown from either clothianidin-treated or untreated (control) seeds, together with strawberry plants and a small population of red mason bees ( Osmia bicornis ). We expected clothianidin to reduce bee foraging activity, resulting in impaired strawberry pollination and bee reproduction. During the early stage of the experiment, we observed no difference between treatments in the length of entire foraging trips, or the combined number of rapeseed and strawberry flowers that the bees visited during these trips. During the later stage of the experiment, we instead determined the time a female took to visit 10 rapeseed flowers, as a proxy for foraging performance. We found that they were 10% slower in clothianidin cages. Strawberries weighed less in clothianidin cages, suggesting reduced pollination performance, but we were unable to relate this to reduced foraging activity, because the strawberry flowers received equally many visits in the two treatments. Clothianidin-exposed females sealed their nests less often, but offspring number, sex ratio and weight were similar between treatments. Observed effects on bee behaviour appeared by the end of the experiment, possibly because of accumulated effects of exposure, reduced bee longevity, or higher sensitivity of the protocols we used during the later phase of the experiment. Although the lack of a mechanistic explanation calls for interpreting the results with cautiousness, the lower strawberry weight in clothianidin cages highlights the importance of understanding complex effects of plant protection products, which could have wider consequences than those on directly exposed organisms."

However, we know little about how it shapes vertebrate faunal community composition over centennial time scales, and this limits our ability to forecast change under projections of future El Niño events. On the basis of correlations between geological records of past El Niño frequency and the species composition of bird and fish remains from a Baja California bone deposit that spans the past 12,000 years, we documented marked faunal restructuring when major El Niño events occurred more than five times per century. This tipping point has implications for the past and future ecology of eastern Pacific coastal environments."
https://openalex.org/W4294990917,"Background Household contact tracing provides TB screening and TB preventive therapy (TPT) to contacts at high risk of TB disease. However, it is resource intensive, inconvenient, and often poorly implemented. We investigated a novel model aiming to improve uptake. Methods Between May and December 2014, we randomised patient with TB who consented to participate in the trial to either standard of care (SOC) or intervention (PACTS) arms. Participants randomised to PACTS received one screening/triage tool (adapted from WHO integrated management of adolescent and adult illnesses [IMAI] guidelines) and sputum pots for each reported household contact. The tool guided participants through symptom screening; TPT (6-months of isoniazid) eligibility; and sputum collection for contacts. Patients randomised to SOC were managed in accordance with national guidelines, that is, they received verbal instruction on who to bring to clinics for investigation using national guidelines. Main outcome and measures The primary outcome was the proportion of adult contacts receiving treatment for TB within 3 months of randomisation. Secondary outcomes were the proportions of child contacts under age 5 years (U5Y) who were commenced on, and completed, TPT. Data were analyzed by logistic regression with random effects to adjust for household clustering. Results Two hundred and fourteen index TB participants were block-randomized from two sites (107 PACTS, reporting 418 contacts; and 107 SOC, reporting 420 contacts). Overall, 62.8% of index TB participants were HIV-positive and 52.1% were TB culture-positive. 250 otherwise eligible TB patients declined participation and 6 households (10 PACTS, 6 SOC) were lost to follow-up and were not included in the analysis. By three months, nine contacts (PACTS: 6, [1.4%]; SOC: 3, [0.7%]) had TB diagnosed, with no difference between groups (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.18, 95% CI: 0.60–7.95). Eligible PACTS contacts (37/96, 38.5%) were more likely to initiate TPT by 3-months compared to SOC contacts (27/101, 26.7%; aOR 2.27, 95% CI: 1.04–4.98). U5Y children in the PACTS arm (47/81 58.0%) were more likely to have initiated TPT before the 3-month visit compared to SOC children (36/89, 41.4%; aOR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.05–5.06). Conclusions and relevance A household-centred patient-delivered symptom screen and IPT eligibility assessment significantly increased timely TPT uptake among U5Y children, but did not significantly increase TB diagnosis. This model needs to be optimized for acceptability, given low participation, and investigated in other low resource settings.

https://openalex.org/W4294992802,"Human foot rigidity is thought to provide a more effective lever with which to push against the ground. Tension of the plantar aponeurosis (PA) with increased metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint dorsiflexion (i.e., the windlass mechanism) has been credited with providing some of this rigidity. However, there is growing debate on whether MTP joint dorsiflexion indeed increases arch rigidity. Further, the arch can be made more rigid independent of additional MTP joint dorsiflexion (e.g., when walking with added mass). The purpose of the present study was therefore to compare the influence of increased MTP joint dorsiflexion with the influence of added mass on the quasi-stiffness of the midtarsal joint in walking. Participants walked with a rounded wedge under their toes to increase MTP joint dorsiflexion in the toe-wedge condition, and wore a weighted vest with 15% of their body mass in the added mass condition. Plantar aponeurosis behavior, foot joint energetics, and midtarsal joint quasi-stiffness were compared between conditions to analyze the mechanisms and effects of arch rigidity differences. Midtarsal joint quasi-stiffness was increased in the toe-wedge and added mass conditions compared with the control condition (both p < 0.001). In the toe-wedge condition, the time-series profiles of MTP joint dorsiflexion and PA strain and force were increased throughout mid-stance (p < 0.001). When walking with added mass, the time-series profile of force in the PA did not increase compared with the control condition although quasi-stiffness did, supporting previous evidence that the rigidity of the foot can be actively modulated. Finally, more mechanical power was absorbed (p = 0.006) and negative work was performed (p < 0.001) by structures distal to the rearfoot in the toe-wedge condition, a condition which displayed increased midtarsal joint quasi-stiffness. This indicates that a more rigid foot may not necessarily transfer power to the ground more efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W4294991221,"School engagement has been demonstrated to be a relevant aspect in promoting students’ successful trajectories, a commitment that in its turn is influenced by contextual factors (family, teachers, and peers). Having instruments to measure these constructs allows decisions to be made to improve student retention, especially relevant in the context of uncertainty caused by covid-19. The aim of the study was to adapt and analyze the psychometric properties of questionnaires used to measure school engagement and contextual factors in the context of the pandemic with elementary school students in Chile. After adaptation of the instruments, through expert evaluation and focus groups with students, they were administered to 579 students in seventh and eighth grade (mean age = 12.79, 52% were boys), and to 334 students in fifth and sixth grade (mean age = 11.35, 38% were boys) in Chile. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the two versions of the school engagement measurement instrument had an adequate fit with the original model of three correlated factors, cognitive, affective, and behavioral commitment. Similarly, these two versions of the instrument measuring the contextual factors had a good fit with the original model of three correlated factors, family, teachers, and peers. In addition, both versions of both questionnaires presented appropriate levels of internal consistency."
https://openalex.org/W4295079173,"Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is a mitochondrion-localized flavoprotein with NADH oxidase activity. AIF normally acts as an oxidoreductase to catalyze the transfer of electrons between molecules, but it can also kill cells when exposed to certain stimuli. For example, intact AIF is cleaved upon exposure to DNA-damaging agents such as etoposide, and truncated AIF (tAIF) is released from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm and translocated to the nucleus where it induces apoptosis. Although the serial events during tAIF-mediated apoptosis and the transition of AIF function have been widely studied from various perspectives, their underlying regulatory mechanisms and the factors involved are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrated that tAIF is a target of the covalent conjugation of the ubiquitin-like moiety ISG15 (referred to as ISGylation), which is mediated by the ISG15 E3 ligase HERC5. In addition, ISGylation increases the stability of tAIF protein as well as its K6-linked polyubiquitination. Moreover, we found that ISGylation increases the nuclear translocation of tAIF upon cytotoxic etoposide treatment, subsequently causing apoptotic cell death in human lung A549 carcinoma cells. Collectively, these results suggest that HERC5-mediated ISG15 conjugation is a key factor in the positive regulation of tAIF-mediated apoptosis, highlighting a novel role of posttranslational ISG15 modification as a switch that allows cells to live or die under the stress that triggers tAIF release."
https://openalex.org/W4294710550,"Mitochondria harbor the bacteria-inherited iron-sulfur cluster assembly (ISC) machinery to generate [2Fe-2S; iron-sulfur (Fe-S)] and [4Fe-4S] proteins. In yeast, assembly of [4Fe-4S] proteins specifically involves the ISC proteins Isa1, Isa2, Iba57, Bol3, and Nfu1. Functional defects in their human equivalents cause the multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndromes, severe disorders with a broad clinical spectrum. The bacterial Iba57 ancestor YgfZ was described to require tetrahydrofolate (THF) for its function in the maturation of selected [4Fe-4S] proteins. Both YgfZ and Iba57 are structurally related to an enzyme family catalyzing THF-dependent one-carbon transfer reactions including GcvT of the glycine cleavage system. On this basis, a universally conserved folate requirement in ISC-dependent [4Fe-4S] protein biogenesis was proposed. To test this idea for mitochondrial Iba57, we performed genetic and biochemical studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and we solved the crystal structure of Iba57 from the thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum. We provide three lines of evidence for the THF independence of the Iba57-catalyzed [4Fe-4S] protein assembly pathway. First, yeast mutants lacking folate show no defect in mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] protein maturation. Second, the 3D structure of Iba57 lacks many of the side-chain contacts to THF as defined in GcvT, and the THF-binding pocket is constricted. Third, mutations in conserved Iba57 residues that are essential for THF-dependent catalysis in GcvT do not impair Iba57 function in vivo, in contrast to an exchange of the invariant, surface-exposed cysteine residue. We conclude that mitochondrial Iba57, despite structural similarities to both YgfZ and THF-binding proteins, does not utilize folate for its function."

https://openalex.org/W4294991285,"In this paper, we analyze the influence of corruption perception, experiences of corruptive behavior, and healthcare autonomy on the public trust in Montenegrin healthcare, by surveying the general population before and after the global COVID-19 pandemic. By providing a quasi-replication of a previous empirical study of corruption and trust in the Croatian public healthcare sector, we introduce the COVID-19 pandemic as a new research context. Before the pandemic, we found a consistent and significant negative influence of the corruptive practices and the generally perceived level of corruption (corruption salience) on the trust in public healthcare. The emergence of COVID-19 had mixed effects: while there is a slightly higher effect of corruption salience to the preference of public healthcare, corruptive experiences still matter but are tolerated much higher than before the pandemic. Public assessment of the autonomy of the health system increases preference for public healthcare, both before and after the pandemic, although the emergence of COVID-19 somewhat lowers this effect. The obtained results point to the most significant challenges of the ‘post-COVID-19’ social context to public health policymaking and management of public healthcare institutions. These include focusing the public healthcare reforms on corruption, reducing waiting times for different diagnostics and medical procedures in the public healthcare system, and regulating the ‘dual practice’ (simultaneous work in public and private healthcare institutions)."
https://openalex.org/W4294991411,"Childhood maltreatment, specifically during sensitive developmental periods, is a major risk factor for poor physical and mental health. Despite its enormous clinical relevance, there is still a lack of scales measuring different types, timing, and duration of childhood maltreatment. The current study sought to validate and determine the psychometric properties of the brief German version of the Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE) scale, the KERF-40. The KERF-40 was administered as an interview (i.e., KERF-40-I) to 287 adult participants with and without mental disorders. Based on item response theory, items of the KERF-40-I were assigned to different types of maltreatment, resulting in a scaled version, the KERF-40+. Test-retest reliability was assessed in a small subsample ( n = 14). Convergent and relative predictive validity were measured with correlations of the KERF-40+ and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) as well as self-report measures of general and trauma-related psychopathology. Rasch analysis and fit statistics yielded a 49-item version, encompassing ten different types of maltreatment. The test-retest reliability of the KERF-40+ was shown to be acceptable to excellent for almost all global and subscale scores (.74 ≤ ρ ≤ 1.00), with the exception of the subscale emotional neglect (ρ = .55). Convergent validity with the CTQ was confirmed for both KERF-40+ global scores (.72 ≤ r ≤ .87) and corresponding subscale scores (.56 ≤ r ≤ .78). Relative predictive validity was reflected by significant small-to-moderate correlations between KERF-40+ global scores and indices of general and trauma-related psychopathology (.24 ≤ r ≤ .45). Taken together, the KERF-40+ appears to be suited for clinicians and researchers interested in retrospectively assessing different types, timing, and duration of childhood maltreatment experiences during sensitive periods in adults."
https://openalex.org/W4294992133,"Epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is continually changing. Frequency of genotypes typical for community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) is increasing in hospitals, as well as resistance to antimicrobial agents. Moreover, different clones predominate in different geographic regions, and temporal shifts occur in the predominant clonal type. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of MRSA, CA-MRSA and PVL-positive MRSA isolates from patients hospitalised in the Military Medical Academy (MMA) and from outpatients, and to perform genotyping of PVL-positive MRSA isolates. MRSA isolates were obtained by standard microbiological techniques. PVL-positive MRSA were detected by single PCR. Determination of SCCmec types in MRSA isolates was done using multiplex PCR and genotyping of PVL-positive MRSA by PFGE, MLST and spa typing. The prevalence of MRSA among S. aureus isolates from different clinical specimens was 43.4%. In outpatients the prevalence of MRSA was 3.2%. SCCmec types specific for CA-MRSA were found in 26% of MRSA isolates from hospitalised patients. In groups, hospitalised patients and outpatients, the prevalence of PVL-positive MRSA isolates was 4%, and all of them harboured SCCmec type V genetic element. PFGE revealed minor differences between four groups of PVL-positive MRSA isolates, but all of them belonged to ST152, and all except one were of the t355 spa type. High prevalence of MRSA and CA-MRSA in MMA, especially the presence of PVL-positive CA-MRSA, represent a serious health threat for patients. Genotype t355/ST152/SCCmec V is the dominant MRSA clone among PVL-positive CA-MRSA."

Here, we probe the tunneling properties of spin-momentum locked relativistic fermions by designing and implementing a tunneling geometry that utilizes nanowires of the topological Kondo insulator candidate, SmB6. The nanowires are attached to the end of scanning tunneling microscope tips, and used to image the bicollinear stripe spin-order in the antiferromagnet Fe1.03Te with a Neel temperature of ~50 K. The antiferromagnetic stripes become invisible above 10 K concomitant with the suppression of the topological surface states. We further demonstrate that the direction of spin-polarization is tied to the tunneling direction. Our technique establishes SmB6 nanowires as ideal conduits for spin-polarized currents."

https://openalex.org/W4294991133,"Twitter as a social media platform has revolutionized the way we interact with others and receive information. The presence of dental schools in Twitter facilitates the engagement of students, educators, dental professionals, and the community. Given the explosive popularity of Twitter as a social media platform and its potential use in the areas of education and branding, the questions of why and how dental schools use these services warrant comprehensive research. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the pattern and use of Twitter as a social media platform for dental schools in Saudi Arabia.The tweets were extracted within the timeframe from July 15, 2019, to July 15, 2020. The Twitter data collected included: full text content, the count of retweets, quotes, replies and likes. Extracted tweets were categorized into five main themes: news and announcement, dental professional communication, general communication, oral health education, and promoting participation. Tweets in each main theme were further categorized according to the dental schools' academic roles namely; education, research and community service. In addition, tweets were classified according to originality of the tweet, language used, nature of the tweet and the use of hashtags and mentions. Descriptive analysis presented in the form of frequency tables with percentages and mean (SD) as well as graphical presentation of the pattern and use of Twitter for Saudi dental schools in the form of bar, pie and line charts. Categorical data were analyzed using chi square test, while continuous data were analyzed using ANOVA. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.A total of 15 Saudi dental schools with Twitter accounts were included in the analysis. King Saud University (KSU) had the largest number of followers with 17,200. Within the time frame of this study, a total of 1,889 original tweets from dental schools were found. Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IAU) had the highest number of posted tweets (n = 647, 34.3%). The distribution of tweets was highest in September 2019 (n = 239) and lowest in July 2020 (n = 22). Majority of the tweets (81.9%) belonged to five out of the 15 dental schools. News and announcements were the most tweeted thematic subject with 1,034 tweets (55%). While community service was the most tweeted academic role with 803 tweets (42%). The top five active dental schools' performance for both thematic and academic role classifications were significantly different based on the chi square test (p < 0.001).This study highlights the importance of Twitter as a social media platform, in dental education especially when it comes to presence and branding for dental schools. Twitter is a helpful platform to expose dental schools to the community, this can be seen by their academic achievements as well as their active role with community service."
https://openalex.org/W4294991655,"Many studies have focused on understanding memory processes due to their importance in daily life. Differences in timing and power spectra of brain signals during encoding task have been linked to later remembered items and were recently used to predict memory retrieval performance. However, accuracies remain low when using non-invasive methods for acquiring brain signals, mainly due to the low spatial resolution. This study investigates the prediction of successful retrieval using estimated source activity corresponding either to cortical or subcortical structures through source localization. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded while participants performed a declarative memory task. Frequency-time analysis was performed using signals from encoding and retrieval tasks to confirm the importance of neural oscillations and their relationship with later remembered and forgotten items. Significant differences in the power spectra between later remembered and forgotten items were found before and during the presentation of the stimulus in the encoding task. Source activity estimation revealed differences in the beta band power over the medial parietal and medial prefrontal areas prior to the presentation of the stimulus, and over the cuneus and lingual areas during the presentation of the stimulus. Additionally, there were significant differences during the stimuli presentation during the retrieval task. Prediction of later remembered items was performed using surface potentials and estimated source activity. The results showed that source localization increases classification performance compared to the one using surface potentials. These findings support the importance of incorporating spatial features of neural activity to improve the prediction of memory retrieval."
https://openalex.org/W4294991896,"Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) that causes high morbidity in the tropics and sub-tropics. Despite the remarkable advancements in the treatment of CL, the available therapeutics are far from ideal and also cause serious adverse side effects. Negative air ions (NAIs) generators are widely available for domestic and industrial uses. Several studies have reported on positive effects of NAIs therapy on human health as a non-pharmaceutical treatment for respiratory disease, allergy, or stress-related health conditions, including infectious diseases. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the effectiveness of the NAIs therapy against Leishmania parasites. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of NAIs therapy on Leishmania major (L. major) the causative agent of CL in in vitro and in a murine model.In vitro anti-leishmanial effects of NAIs therapy were measured by parasitological methods. NAIs therapy was assessed in vivo in L. major infected BALB/c mice by measuring the footpad (FP) lesion size and parasite load using metric caliper tool and qPCR, respectively. Immune responses in treated and non-treated mice were assessed by measuring the levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, NO and arginase activity. In vitro NAIs therapy significantly decreased the viability of Leishmania promastigotes and of amastigotes cultured in macrophages, but did not affect the host cells. NAIs therapy of L. major infected BALB/c mice resulted in reduced FP lesion size, diminished parasite burden, and importantly decreased induction of IL-4 and arginase activity in the presence of NAIs. In contrast IFN-γ and NO levels were significantly enhanced. NAIs therapy significantly diminished the progression of disease compared to the control group, but was less effective than amphotericin B treatment.Our study shows that NAIs treatment was effective in vitro and in Leishmania-infected mice, elicited a T-helper 1 (Th1) response and increased efficient cellular immunity, resulting in a diminished parasite load. Therefore, NAIs therapy can be considered as a useful and safe tool that can contribute to clearing L. major infections without inducing toxicity in host cells. The applications and mechanisms of NAIs therapy warrant further investigation especially in humans suffering from CL."
https://openalex.org/W4294992043,"Blood culturing remains the ""gold standard"" for bloodstream infection (BSI) diagnosis, but the method is inaccessible to many developing countries due to high costs and insufficient resources. To better understand the utility of blood cultures among patients in Indonesia, a country where blood cultures are not routinely performed, we evaluated data from a previous cohort study that included blood cultures for all participants. An acute febrile illness study was conducted from July 2013 to June 2016 at eight major hospitals in seven provincial capitals in Indonesia. All participants presented with a fever, and two-sided aerobic blood cultures were performed within 48 hours of hospital admission. Positive cultures were further assessed for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns. Specimens from participants with negative culture results were screened by advanced molecular and serological methods for evidence of causal pathogens. Blood cultures were performed for 1,459 of 1,464 participants, and the 70.6% (1,030) participants that were negative by dengue NS1 antigen test were included in further analysis. Bacteremia was observed in 8.9% (92) participants, with the most frequent pathogens being Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (41) and Paratyphi A (10), Escherichia coli (14), and Staphylococcus aureus (10). Two S. Paratyphi A cases had evidence of AMR, and several E. coli cases were multidrug resistant (42.9%, 6/14) or monoresistant (14.3%, 2/14). Culture contamination was observed in 3.6% (37) cases. Molecular and serological assays identified etiological agents in participants having negative cultures, with 23.1% to 90% of cases being missed by blood cultures. Blood cultures are a valuable diagnostic tool for hospitalized patients presenting with fever. In Indonesia, pre-screening patients for the most common viral infections, such as dengue, influenza, and chikungunya viruses, would maximize the benefit to the patient while also conserving resources. Blood cultures should also be supplemented with advanced laboratory tests when available."
https://openalex.org/W4294992637,"The recently discovered insecticidal protein Mpp75Aa1.1 from Brevibacillus laterosporus is a member of the ETX_MTX family of beta-pore forming proteins (β-PFPs) expressed in genetically modified (GM) maize to control western corn rootworm (WCR; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte). In this manuscript, bioinformatic analysis establishes that although Mpp75Aa1.1 shares varying degrees of similarity to members of the ETX_MTX2 protein family, it is unlikely to have any allergenic, toxic, or otherwise adverse biological effects. The safety of Mpp75Aa1.1 is further supported by a weight of evidence approach including evaluation of the history of safe use (HOSU) of ETX_MTX2 proteins and Breviballus laterosporus. Comparisons between purified Mpp75Aa1.1 protein and a poly-histidine-tagged (His-tagged) variant of the Mpp75Aa1.1 protein demonstrate that both forms of the protein are heat labile at temperatures at or above 55°C, degraded by gastrointestinal proteases within 0.5 min, and have no adverse effects in acute mouse oral toxicity studies at a dose level of 1920 or 2120 mg/kg body weight. These results support the use of His-tagged proteins as suitable surrogates for assessing the safety of their non-tagged parent proteins. Taken together, we report that Mpp75Aa1.1 is the first ETX-MTX2 insecticidal protein from B. laterosporus and displays a similar safety profile as typical Cry proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis."
