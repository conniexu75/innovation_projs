https://openalex.org/W2033470468,Relief of intractable pain was produced in six human patients by stimulation of electrodes permanently implanted in the periventricular and periaqueductal gray matter. The level of stimulation sufficient to induce pain relief seems not to alter the acute pain threshold. Indiscriminate repetitive stimulation produced tolerance to both stimulation-produced pain relief and the analgesic action of narcotic medication; this process could be reversed by abstinence from stimulation. Stimulation-produced relief of pain was reversed by naloxone in five out of six patients. These results suggest that satisfactory alleviation of persistent pain in humans may be obtained by electronic stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W1553013513,"Colony-stimulating factor, which specifically stimulates mouse bone marrow cells to proliferate in vitro and generate colonies of granulocytes, or macrophages, or both, was purified 3500-fold from mouse lung-conditioned medium. Analysis by discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated that there was a single protein component. All of the colony-stimulating activity was coincident with the protein band. The molecular weight of colony-stimulating factor estimated by gel filtration was approximately 29,000 and by electrophoresis approximately 23,000. The specific activity of purified colony-stimulating factor from mouse lung-conditioned medium bound to concanavalin A-Sapharose, indicating that it is a glycoprotein. The small percentage of colony-stimulating factor in mouse lung-conditioned medium which did not bind to concanavalin A-Sepharose appeared to represent molecules which lacked the carbohydrate moieties required for binding to this lectin. It was necessary to include low concentrations (less than 0.01%, v/v) of polymers such as gelatin and polyethylene glycol, or nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100, in all of the buffers used throughout the purification scheme, otherwise colony-stimulating factor was lost from solution. At high concentrations (greater than 20 mug/ml) the factor stimulated the formation of granulocytic, macrophage, and mixed colonies from C57BL mouse bone marrow cells. As the concentration of purified colony-stimulating factor was decreased, the frequency of colonies containing granulocytes also decreased. At low concentrations of colony-stimulating factor (less than 70 pg/ml) only macrophage colonies were stimulated."
https://openalex.org/W1979580749,"Abstract Three aspects of terminal differentiation of the epidermal keratinocyte have been studied in cell culture—the development of detergent-insoluble cytoplasmic filaments, the formation of a cornified cell envelope and the destruction of the cell nucleus. In the presence of lethally irradiated 3T3 cells, single human epidermal keratinocytes grow into stratified colonies. After the colonies become confluent, the culture enters a steady state in which the upper cells are shed from the surface of the cell layer like stratum corneum cells in vivo and are replaced by the proliferation of dividing cells in the basal layer. The cells shed into the medium are flattened and elongated squames, and are insoluble in solutions of sodium dodecylsulfate. Since the squames usually detach before their nuclei are digested, the cultures behave like some wet-surfaced, stratified squamous epithelia in that they possess little or no anucleate stratum corneum. The rates of proliferation and squame detachment in confluent cultures are increased by the presence of epidermal growth factor. Most of the squames harvested from the medium are permeable to trypan blue. The permeable squames may or may not have a visible nucleus, but squames not permeable to trypan blue nearly always possess a nucleus. When freshly detached squames containing nuclei are incubated in medium containing serum, their nuclei are digested and disappear within a few days. On the other hand, if the squames are washed and incubated in serum-free medium, their nuclei are not digested. This suggests that the permeable cell membrane permits a serum component essential for nuclear digestion to enter the cytoplasm. When growing colonies of epidermal keratinocytes are disaggregated and the cells suspended in medium containing methyl cellulose, they cannot multiply, but within a few days the cells become permeable to trypan blue and insoluble in sodium dodecylsulfate. This insolubility is due to disulfide linking of the proteins of the abundant cytoplasmic filaments, for the filaments are dissolved when β-mercaptoethanol is added as well, leaving the emptied cornified cell envelopes. Nuclear digestion follows some days later. In the absence of serum, cells become permeable and develop detergent-insoluble filaments and a cornified envelope, but, as in the case of spontaneously detached squames of surface cultures, their nuclei are not destroyed. Purified plasminogen supports nuclear destruction, whereas serum depleted of plasminogen does not. Earlier studies on intact skin have suggested that chemical gradients between epidermis and dermis might be responsible for the differentiation of the epidermal cells. In surface culture, basal cells multiply and nonbasal cells undergo terminal differentiation, even though all the cells are bathed in the same medium and the terminally differentiating cells have, if anything, better access to the medium than do the basal cells. Differentiation also begins in virtually all singly suspended cells uniformly exposed to the medium. The program of differentiation is therefore independent of the orientation of any chemical gradients in the cellular environment. Cell-cell contacts are not required for the development of detergent insolubility, the formation of the cornified envelope or the process of nuclear digestion, although they are essential for the formation of flattened squames. Unlike proliferation, which is strongly dependent upon fibroblast products, terminal differentiation proceeds in the absence of fibroblast support."
https://openalex.org/W2040289923,"CYTOTOXIC T cells are important in graft rejection and in the control of virus infections, but the mode of interaction of these cells with their targets, particularly in man remains unclear. It has been shown in mice that products of genes in the major histocompatibility complex (H–2) are involved in these interactions even when the cytotoxic T cells are specific for viral or non-H–2 antigens. This involvement is seen as the requirements that the target cell must express the specific non-H–2 antigen and in addition the same H–2, D or K region antigens as were present on the cells which initiated the immune response1–4. Cytotoxic T cells specific for viral or non-H–2 antigens are thus restricted in the targets that they can kill by the H–2 antigens on the targets. For example, cytotoxic T cells from H–2b female mice suitably primed to the Y antigen of H–2b males, will only kill cells from male mice carrying an H–2D region derived from H–2b (refs 5,6). This report is to our knowledge the first clear demonstration that a similar restriction occurs in man. We describe a situation in man where cytotoxic reactions specific for non-HLA antigens can only occur when target cells carry both the HLA-A2 antigen of the original sensitising cell and the non-HLA target determinant(s). The strong association with maleness suggests that one of the specific antigens involved was coded for by the Y chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2083077785,"Since the occurrence of vomiting as a response to motion is both widespread and apparently disadvantageous, it presents a problem for evolutionary theory. An hypothesis is proposed suggesting that motion sickness is triggered by difficulties which arise in the programming of movements of the eyes or head when the relations between the spatial frameworks defined by the visual, vestibular, or proprioceptive inputs are repeatedly and unpredictably perturbed. Such perturbations may be produced by certain types of motion, or by disturbances in sensory input or motor control produced by ingested toxins. The last would be the important cause in nature, the main function of the emesis being to rid the individual of ingested neurotoxins. Its occurrence in response to motion would be an accidental byproduct of this system."

https://openalex.org/W2032541171,"Experimental infection with both human- and rat-derived Pneumocystis carinii has been produced in nude mice by intrapulmonary injection of lung homogenates that contained P. carinii and by environmental transmission. Most infected mice did not appear ill, and their lungs exhibited a mild and nonspecific inflammatory response. Thus, P. carinii can be transmitted from one animal species to another, and this result suggests that a defect in thymic-dependent lymphocytes is important in the development of the infection. Experimental work with P. carinii in the nude mouse should be performed in isolators because of the communicability of the organism."

https://openalex.org/W2091330154,"When the serum concentration of the culture medium is below 0.7 per-cent, 3T3 mouse cells lose most of their large external transformation sensitive (LETS) protein at the cell surface, Subsequent addition of epidermal growth factor results in the reappearance of massive fibrillar LETS protein networks on the surface of conluent 3T3 cells. Thirteen other hormones tested do not have this effect. It appears that epidermal growth factor can control the expression of LETS protein."
https://openalex.org/W2089559975,"The rate of rod outer segment renewal in Rana pipiens tadpoles under constant light and under diurnal conditions of 12 or 2 hours light per day is significantly increased compared to that in animals in darkness. Furthermore, during 24 hours in light after 6 days in darkness the rate of renewal is three to four times that in darkness. In Xenopus laevis tadpoles the rate of renewal is more than five times greater during the first 8 hours of a normal diurnal cycle than during the following 16 hours. These observations demonstrate that bursts of renewal activity occur as a response to light, and suggest that a normal pattern of light alternating with darness plays a fundamental role in the regulation of rod outer segment turnover."

https://openalex.org/W1510450482,"The HLA-linked B cell alloantigen (p29,34) is composed of two subunits of 29,000 (p29) and 34,000 (p34) molecular weight. The partially purified HLA-linked B cell alloantigen was purified by a final step of preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. An antiserum was prepared against p29,34 which specifically lysed B lymphocytes. In sodium dodecyl sulfate at 21 degrees, p29 and p34 remained noncovalently associated and retained immunologic activity; subunit dissociation at higher temperatures correlated with loss of immunologic activity. Although the pI values of p29 and p34 are 6.1 and 5.2, respectively, the subunits co-electrofocus under nondenaturing conditions. In addition, cross-linking studies showed the B cell antigen has a (p29)1(p34)1 subunit structure."

https://openalex.org/W2072149754,"Young NZB/W mice, treated with injections of soluble immune response suppressor (SIRS)(supernatant from mouse spleen cells exposed to concanavalin A), showed decreased immunoglobulin levels, less antibody to cell nuclei, less proteinuria, and less renal pathology as compared with NZB/W mice receiving a control preparation. Thus, SIRS administration beginning at an early age appears to be an effective therapy of the autoimmune disease in NZB/W mice."

https://openalex.org/W2025237524,"A line of Buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A) that multiplies in the absence of serum produces a family of polypeptides termed MSA that can partially satisfy the serum requirement for growth of chick embryo fibroblasts. Pierson and Temin, 1972 Pierson Jr., R.W. Temin H.M. The partial purification from calf serum of a fraction with multiplication-stimulating activity for chicken fibroblasts in cell culture and with non-suppressible insulin-like activity. J. Cell. Physiol. 1972; 79: 319-330 Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar proposed that BRL cells multiply in serum-free medium because they produce MSA. This does not appear to be the case. We have studied three BRL cell lines: 3A2 and 3A have diverged from the same original isolate from normal liver; 61t is a spontaneous transformant of a different isolate. All three cell lines showed a 10 fold increase in cell number during 5 days in serum-free medium. However, 3A-conditioned medium stimulated 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA in chick embryo fibroblasts and human skin fibroblasts; 3A2- and 61t-conditioned media did not. After ion-exchange chromatography or gel filtration of the conditioned media and measurement of MSA by 3H-thymidine incorporation or radioreceptor assay, MSA again was found in the 3A medium but not in the 3A2 or 61t media. The absence of MSA in the 3A2 and 61t media was not due to inactivation of MSA by these two cell lines. Addition of partially purified MSA to 3A2 cells did not increase their multiplication rate in serum-free medium. We conclude that the ability of the BRL cells to multiply in serum-free medium is independent of the level of MSA in the medium."
https://openalex.org/W1603428911,"Changes in the 32P content of proteins due to muscle contraction were investigated, using muscles dissected from liver frogs injected with [32P]orthophosphate. The only significant change found was in the radioactivity of the 18,000-dalton light chain of myosin; during a single tetanus, an increase of 85 to 90% occurred as compared to the resting muscle. This increase corresponded to about 0.4 mol of 32P per mol of light chain. The same increase in radioactivity of this light chain was also found upon caffeine-induced contracture of the intact muscle. It is postulated that the increased Ca2+ concentration in the sarcoplasm resulting from electrical stimulus or caffeine treatment activates the myosin light chain kinase which phosphorylates the 18,000-dalton light chain."

This effect on elongating neurites may involve alterations in nerve-substratum interactions by the presence of undifferentiated target tissues. The relationship between nerve fibers and their potential innervation sites can explain directed nerve growth to the developing limb.

The purity of the enzyme preparation was established by its behavior in disc electrophoresis in the presence and absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and by analytical ultracentrifugation. The molecular weight of the enzyme as determined by sedimentation equilibrium was found to be about 80,300, a value similar to those obtained by gel filtration, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and sucrose gradient centrifugation. The molecular weight of the enzyme, denatured with either sodium dodecyl sulfate or guanidine hydrochloride, was found to be about 45,000 and 41,000, respectively. The dimeric structure was supported by sedimentation in sucrose gradients. Further evidence for the dimetic nature of the enzyme was obtained by gel electrophoresis of the enzyme treated with dimethylsuberimidate and sodium dodecyl sulfate."
