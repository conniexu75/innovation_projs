https://openalex.org/W2091699432,"The low carbon-13/carbon-12 ratio of lipids is shown to result from isotopic fractionation during the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A. In vitro analysis of the kinetic isotope effects of this reaction indicates that there will be a large, temperature-dependent difference in the carbon-13/carbon-12 ratio between the methyl and carbonyl carbon atoms of acetyl coenzyme A and between those carbon atoms of lipid components which derive from them."

Concentrations of lactoferrin below that necessary for total inhibition resulted in a marked reduction in viable colony-forming units. This bactericidal effect was contingent upon the metal-chelating properties of the lactoferrin molecule."

It leads to the following observations: •—If the tracks of many cells are examined, cell line characteristic track patterns become apparent. •—In several cases, second or third generation descendents of 3T3 cells were observed to repeat track patterns of their ancestor cell. •—If a 3T3 cell collides with another 3T3 cell or a nonmigrating BSC-1 cell, it forms an outgoing track from the impact area as if the cell was elastically reflected at the target."

An intrinsic macrophage cytotoxic effector system is modulated by serum and other environmental factors that can either enhance or suppress tumor killing. Activated macrophages kill tumor cells only when a regulating threshold drops to a critically low level."
https://openalex.org/W2038435336,"The mutagenic activities of several flavonoids and flavonoid metabolites were examined by means of Salmonella typhimurium mutants that reveal base-pair substitution and frameshift mutagens. Of the compounds tested (naringin, rutin, neohesperetin, hesperetin, dihydroquercetin, quercetin, quercetin pentaacetate, permethylquercetin, m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and m,p-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid), only quercetin was mutagenic without microsomal activation. With activation, however, the mutagenic activity of quercetin was increased significantly and that of quercetin pentaacetate was revealed. The health implications of these findings and aspects of flavonoid structural requirements for mutagenic activity are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1983017779,"Kinetics of integration of membrane proteins were studied in E. coli to discover how membrane proteins find their final location in the functional membrane. The experiments make use of a simple and convenient method developed for isolating inner and outer membranes from a number of small-scale cultures with high recovery. Among the proteins that constitute the cell surface structures, inner membrane proteins are integrated most rapidly after synthesis, whereas outer membrane proteins delay somewhat, and periplasmic proteins delay further in reaching their destinations. Protein I, a major outer membrane protein with molecular weight of about 37,000 daltons, exhibits significantly slower rates of integration than other outer membrane proteins. The decreased fluidity of membrane lipids by temperature shiftdown of an unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph grown on elaidate results in abnormally slow assembly of the outer membrane proteins and also in an anomalous assembly of the inner membrane proteins, suggesting that the fluid state of the lipids is required for normal operation of these processes. The possible relevance of these findings to the mechanism of membrane formation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2051403241,"We have demonstrated that a wheat germ extract, primed with yeast RNA, synthesizes at least thirty five yeast ribosomal proteins. These proteins are all coded by mRNA molecules which contain poly(A). By quantitative analysis of the products formed under limiting mRNA concentrations, we have measured the level of mRNA for the individual ribosomal proteins under various conditions. In confirmation of studies in vivo ( Gorenstein and Warner, 1976 Gorenstein C. Warner J.R. Coordinate regulation of the synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomal proteins. in: Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 73. 1976: 1547-1551 Google Scholar ), we find that the synthesis of mRNA for the different ribosomal proteins is coordinately regulated. Within 5 min after wild-type cells are shifted from 23°C to 36°C, the synthesis of mRNA for most of the ribosomal proteins ceases. The mRNA for ribosomal proteins that is present decays with a half-life of 8–15 min. The synthesis of mRNA for nonribosomal proteins is relatively unaffected. After 15–20 min, the synthesis of mRNA for ribosomal proteins resumes, and by 60 min, the production of ribosomal components has equilibrated at the increased temperature. In a set of mutants temperature-sensitive (ts) for ribosome synthesis, the resumption of synthesis of mRNA for ribosomal proteins never occurs, and the cells are thus unable to form new ribosomes at the restrictive temperature, although transcription of ribosomal precursor RNA continues. We conclude that the synthesis of ribosomal proteins in yeast is coordinately regulated at the level of transcription. Furthermore, transcription of ribosomal precursor RNA can be uncoupled from the transcription of mRNA for ribosomal proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1991971226,"Abstract The expression of six different carried by hybrid Col E1 plasmids was studied using E. coli harboring these plasmids. Three of the operons were previously shown to have for tRNA 2 Glu in their spacers, while the remaining three have genes for tRNA 1 Ile and tRNA 1B Ala . These strains overproduced spacer tRNAs encoded by the spacer genes, indicating gene dosage effects in rRNA transcription. The gene dosage effects were demonstrated under three different conditions: during exponential growth, after recovery from amino acid starvation and during chloramphenicol treatment. Under the latter two conditions, where plasmids were amplified, preferential spacer tRNA accumulation was pronounced (up to a 10 fold increase relative to ordinary nonspacer tRNAs). The overproduction of spacer tRNAs, however, was not accompanied by increased accumulation of 16S or 23S rRNA, indicating that without a concomitant ribosomal protein synthesis, excess rRNA is degraded. The gene dosage effects observed strongly suggest that in normal exponentially growing cells, the rate of transcription of rRNA operons is not limited by the amount of functional RNA polymerase, but is limited by the capacity of promoters of rRNA operons. The present system also allowed detection of unique 5S RNA species and some other tRNAs, such as tRNA 1 Asp , whose are associated with, or located close to, individual rRNA operons."

https://openalex.org/W1987869179,"At least three different transfer RNAs are produced by in vitro processing of 30S ribosomal RNA which accumulates in RNAase III− strains of E. coli. Two of these tRNAs, tRNA2Glu and tRNA1He, have previously been shown to be “spacer tRNAs”—that is, genes for their synthesis are located in rRNA transcription units between the cistrons for 16S and 23S rRNAs (Lund et al., 1976). The third tRNA whose sequences are contained in 30S rRNA is tRNA1BAla. In addition to the tRNAs, 5S rRNA and several other 4S fragments are produced. Some of these 4S fragments may represent additional spacer tRNAs. One fragment, about 70 nucleotides long, arises from the 5′ end of the 17S precursor of 16S rRNA. Four or five other tRNAs are hydrogen-bonded to 30S rRNA as we prepare it; one or more of these tRNAs may also be a spacer tRNA. The enzymes that process tRNAs out of 30S rRNA are associated with ribosomes, but can be removed from them by washing in 0.2 M NH4CI; the enzymes required for 5S rRNA processing remain bound to the 0.2 M NH4CI-washed ribosomes. Treatment of 30S rRNA with purified RNAase III produces 6-8S fragments which contain the sequences of tRNA2Glu, tRNA1BAla and 5S rRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1549680332,"Escherichia coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme bound to promoter sites on T7 DNA is attacked and inactivated by the polyanion heparin. The highly stable RNA polymerase-T7 DNA complex formed at the major T7 A1 promoter can be completely inactivated by treatment with heparin, as shown by monitoring the loss of activity of such complexes, and by gel electrophoresis of the RNA products transcribed. The rate of this inactivation is much faster than the rate of dissociation of RNA polymerase from promoter complexes, and thus represents a direct attack of heparin on the polymerase molecule bound at promoter A1. Experiments employing the nitrocellulose filter binding technique suggest that heparin inactivates E. coli RNA polymerase when bound to T7 DNA by directly displacing the enzyme from the DNA. RNA polymerase bound at a minor T7 promoter (promoter C) is much less sensitive to heparin attack than enzyme bound at promoter A1. Thus, the rate of inactivation of RNA polymerase-T7 DNA complexes by heparin is dependent upon the structure of the promoter involved even though the inhibitor binds to a site on the enzyme molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1542784231,"As a component of bacteriophage Qbeta replicase, S1 is required both for initiation of Qbeta minus strand RNA synthesis and for translational repression, which has been traced to the ability of the enzyme to bind to an internal site in the Qbeta RNA molecule. Previously, Senear and Steitz (Senear, A. W., and Steitz, J. A. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 1902-1912) found that isolated S1 protein binds specifically to an oligonucleotide spanning residues -38 to -63 from the 3' terminus of Qbeta RNA. Here we report that S1 also interacts strongly with a second oligonucleotide in Qbeta RNA, which is derived from the region recognized by replicase just 5' to the Qbeta coat protein cistron. Both sequences exhibit pyrimidine-rich regions."
https://openalex.org/W1623520081,"Superhelical covalently closed circular replicative form DNA (RF I) of coliphage M13 appears as a relaxed molecule that has a base-unpaired region in the form of a bubble (100 to 200 base pairs long) seen in electron micrographs when spread in the presence of formaldehyde and formamide or after pretreatment with glyoxal. S1 endonuclease, specific for single-stranded DNA, converts superhelical M13 RF I DNA, but not nonsuperhelical M13 RF I to a significant extent, into unit-length linear molecules by sequential nicking of two strands. The locations of S1 nuclease-susceptible sites and glyoxal-fixed base-unpaired regions were both related to the five A-T-rich regions in M13 RF DNA. While S1 nuclease does not show preference for any of these sites, glyoxal-fixed bubbles occur predominantly at the major A-T-rich region in M13 RF DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1554492753,"Starvation of strains of Escherichia coli which are glycerol auxotrophs and are also defective in beta oxidation results in the accumulation of large amounts of free fatty acid (Cronan, J. E., Jr., Weisberg, L. W., and Allen, R. G. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 5835-5840). We now report that addition of exogenous oleic acid to these cultures results in no decrease in the synthesis of the unsaturated acids of the free fatty acid fraction although a 40 to 60% decrease of [14C]acetate incorporation into phospholipid unsaturated acyl moieties occurs under these conditions. This result indicates that the decreased synthesis of phospholipid unsaturated acyl moieties observed by others during oleic acid supplementation can be attributed to competition between exogenous and endogenously synthesized unsaturated fatty acids rather than a curtailment of unsaturated fatty acid synthesis per se."
https://openalex.org/W1999530632,"DNA-RNA hybridization experiments show that essentially all of the genomic information is transcribed. High, intermediate, and rare abundance classes of messenger RNA (mRNA) are present, and their estimated complexities are equal to about 240, 1300, and 700 average-sized mRNA species, respectively. The high abundance mRNA species are present, on average, two to three copies per cell and constitute about 95 percent of the mRNA mass. Intermediate abundance mRNA species are present, on average, about once per 35 cells. The relative abundance and complexity of these mRNA classes correspond well with previous respective measurements on protein. Rare RNA species are thought to represent maximally repressed genes. Analysis of RNA synthesized in vitro by isolated nucleoids (chromosomes) suggests that sense and nonsense sequences are extensively interspersed on a given strand of the DNA."

The size of the products after 3' leads to 5'-hydrolysis of 5'-labeled substrate is temperature-dependent. At 25 degrees the enzyme can hydrolyze a polynucleotide chain up to the last 5'-terminal dinucleotide. A gradation of higher 5'-terminal oligonucleotides of defined chain lengths is produced after limit digestion by the enzyme when the temperature is raised between 25 degrees to 60 degrees.

The key step in this purification is the use of a tRNA-Sepharose affinity column. The purified enzyme has a specific activity of approximately 280 mumol of AMP incorporated/min/mg of protein at 37 degrees and has a molecular weight of 52,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of Sephadex chromatography. The turnover number of the pure enzyme, under optimal assay conditions, is estimated as 21,000, and we believe it constitutes only o.oo6% of the total cellular protein. Both AMP- and CMP-incorporating activities have an identical isoelectric point of 5.85. The AMP-incorporating activity of the enzyme is inhibitied by some transition metal chelating agents but not by others."

Codon-directed release factors' (RF) 1 and 2 release of f[3H]methionine is inhibited by cloacin. Since cloacin inhibits RF1 and -2 binding to ribosomes but not RF-directed f[3H]methionine release from f[3H]met-tRNA-AUG-ribosome complexes when reactions contain 20% ethanol, we conclude that cloacin DF 13 inhibits formation of the termination codon recognition complex. Thus, cleavage of the 3'-OH 49-nucleotide sequence of the 16 S rRNA perturbs the codon-directed binding of RF to ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1493291452,"Abstract The uptake of 3-O-methylglucose by rat thymocytes follows a biphasic time course. 2,4-Dinitrophenol (10-3 M), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (10-5 M) and oligomycin (5 microgram/ml) each reduce ATP levels in rat thymocytes by 85% and bring about 3- to 4-fold stimulation of the slow phase of 3-O-methylglucose uptake. No consistent effect is observed on either the half-time of the rapid phase of uptake or the relative proportions of the two phases of uptake in the presence of these agents. Ca2+ ions do not appear to play a necessary role in the stimulation of transport activity since cells depleted of exchangeable Ca2+ by treatment with the Ca2+-Mg2+ ionophore, A23187, plus [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid respond to uncouplers in exactly the same manner as untreated cells. The effect of dinitrophenol on the slow phase of 3-O-methylglucose uptake is reversible after 10 min of incubation. After 60 min however, cells washed free of dinitrophenol and incubated at 37 degrees exhibited an additional acceleration in transport activity. This stimulation of transport is characterized by an increase in the proportion of the rapid phase of uptake with little or no change in its half-time. The results suggest that rat thymocytes regulate their 3-O-methylglucose transport activity in two distinct fashions."

By using a sulfhydryl-containing medium that ocupies 65 to 75% of the culture tube volume, together with the five supplements recommended by Nakamura, we have obtained growth rates some eight times above the original. The new physicochemical environment and the use of adenosine triphosphate as an index of energy status in the presence and absence of growth provide a basis for investigating the physiology and growth of other noncultivated microbes."

The corresponding phage tRNA species were examined for sequence homology by RNA-DNA hybridization analysis and by their relative behavior on reversed phase chromatography. The results indicate that all three T-even phages code for similar tRNA species; however, some tRNA species are homologous, others are not, and not all of the same tRNA species are coded by each bacteriophage. Reversed phase chromatography showed the presence of isoacceptor tRNAs for each phage aminoacyl-tRNA species.

The inhibition of the aspartokinase by L-serine displays homotropic cooperative effects and is competitive versus aspartate. The inhibition by L-serine of the homoserine dehydrogenase displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics which are of a competitive nature versus homoserine. Characteristic effects of L-serine on the protein include a perturbation of its absorption and fluorescence spectra, with an increase in the fluorescence of the protein-NADPH complex. L-serine shifts the allosteric equilibrium of the protein to a T-like conformation to which L-threonine binds noncooperatively. L-Serine, a threonine analog, is not capable, as the physiological effector, of inducing a complete R to T transition of the enzyme; the aspartokinase globules show a cooperative conformation change upon serine binding, but this conformation change is not found in the homoserine dehydrogenase globules."

Hybridization of unlabeled globin RNA produced by this technique to labeled globin cDNA indicated the population of RNA sequences represented at least 80% of the template sequences. Approximately 30% of the RNA product by mass contains poly(A) tails as determined by binding to oligo(dT)-cellulose.
