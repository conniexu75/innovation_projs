https://openalex.org/W2605253636,"Background Current approaches to predict cardiovascular risk fail to identify many people who would benefit from preventive treatment, while others receive unnecessary intervention. Machine-learning offers opportunity to improve accuracy by exploiting complex interactions between risk factors. We assessed whether machine-learning can improve cardiovascular risk prediction. Methods Prospective cohort study using routine clinical data of 378,256 patients from UK family practices, free from cardiovascular disease at outset. Four machine-learning algorithms (random forest, logistic regression, gradient boosting machines, neural networks) were compared to an established algorithm (American College of Cardiology guidelines) to predict first cardiovascular event over 10-years. Predictive accuracy was assessed by area under the ‘receiver operating curve’ (AUC); and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) to predict 7.5% cardiovascular risk (threshold for initiating statins). Findings 24,970 incident cardiovascular events (6.6%) occurred. Compared to the established risk prediction algorithm (AUC 0.728, 95% CI 0.723–0.735), machine-learning algorithms improved prediction: random forest +1.7% (AUC 0.745, 95% CI 0.739–0.750), logistic regression +3.2% (AUC 0.760, 95% CI 0.755–0.766), gradient boosting +3.3% (AUC 0.761, 95% CI 0.755–0.766), neural networks +3.6% (AUC 0.764, 95% CI 0.759–0.769). The highest achieving (neural networks) algorithm predicted 4,998/7,404 cases (sensitivity 67.5%, PPV 18.4%) and 53,458/75,585 non-cases (specificity 70.7%, NPV 95.7%), correctly predicting 355 (+7.6%) more patients who developed cardiovascular disease compared to the established algorithm. Conclusions Machine-learning significantly improves accuracy of cardiovascular risk prediction, increasing the number of patients identified who could benefit from preventive treatment, while avoiding unnecessary treatment of others."
https://openalex.org/W2601414401,"Blockade of angiogenesis can retard tumour growth, but may also paradoxically increase metastasis. This paradox may be resolved by vessel normalization, which involves increased pericyte coverage, improved tumour vessel perfusion, reduced vascular permeability, and consequently mitigated hypoxia. Although these processes alter tumour progression, their regulation is poorly understood. Here we show that type 1 T helper (TH1) cells play a crucial role in vessel normalization. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that gene expression features related to vessel normalization correlate with immunostimulatory pathways, especially T lymphocyte infiltration or activity. To delineate the causal relationship, we used various mouse models with vessel normalization or T lymphocyte deficiencies. Although disruption of vessel normalization reduced T lymphocyte infiltration as expected, reciprocal depletion or inactivation of CD4+ T lymphocytes decreased vessel normalization, indicating a mutually regulatory loop. In addition, activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes by immune checkpoint blockade increased vessel normalization. TH1 cells that secrete interferon-γ are a major population of cells associated with vessel normalization. Patient-derived xenograft tumours growing in immunodeficient mice exhibited enhanced hypoxia compared to the original tumours in immunocompetent humans, and hypoxia was reduced by adoptive TH1 transfer. Our findings elucidate an unexpected role of TH1 cells in vasculature and immune reprogramming. TH1 cells may be a marker and a determinant of both immune checkpoint blockade and anti-angiogenesis efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2605251370,"Chronic rhinosinusitis has a significant impact on patient quality of life, creates billions of dollars of annual healthcare costs, and accounts for ∼20% of adult antibiotic prescriptions in the United States. Because of the rise of resistant microorganisms, there is a critical need to better understand how to stimulate and/or enhance innate immune responses as a therapeutic modality to treat respiratory infections. We recently identified bitter taste receptors (taste family type 2 receptors, or T2Rs) as important regulators of sinonasal immune responses and potentially important therapeutic targets. Here, we examined the immunomodulatory potential of flavones, a class of flavonoids previously demonstrated to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. Some flavones are also T2R agonists. We found that several flavones inhibit Muc5AC and inducible NOS up-regulation as well as cytokine release in primary and cultured airway cells in response to several inflammatory stimuli. This occurs at least partly through inhibition of protein kinase C and receptor tyrosine kinase activity. We also demonstrate that sinonasal ciliated epithelial cells express T2R14, which closely co-localizes ( p roline, a lanine, and v aline at positions 49, 262, and 296, respectively) or non-functional (AVI: a lanine, v aline, i soleucine at positions 49, 262, and 296, respectively) T2R38. Our data demonstrate that T2R14 in sinonasal cilia is a potential therapeutic target for upper respiratory infections and that flavones may have clinical potential as topical therapeutics, particularly in T2R38 AVI/AVI individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2599535880,"A general simulation approach that can replicate, and in theory predict, the growth of a wide range of crystal types, including porous, molecular and ionic crystals, is demonstrated. Understanding crystal growth is essential for controlling functionality in modern materials. Michael Anderson et al. describe a simulation approach to predicting crystal growth that can replicate, and in theory predict, the fine details of surface structure and habit for a wide range of crystal types, including porous crystalline materials, metal–organic frameworks and ionic crystals. The method is based on Monte Carlo simulations of 'units of growth'—space-filling tiles or Voronoi polyhedra, depending on the nature of the crystal. This is a coarse-grained alternative to the computationally intensive and sometimes intractable problem of simulating individual atomic positions. The approach replicates the surface structure of experimentally grown crystals that incorporate growth modifiers or common defects, and those grown out of equilibrium, and could be applicable across a variety of crystal systems, the authors say. Understanding and predicting crystal growth is fundamental to the control of functionality in modern materials. Despite investigations for more than one hundred years1,2,3,4,5, it is only recently that the molecular intricacies of these processes have been revealed by scanning probe microscopy6,7,8. To organize and understand this large amount of new information, new rules for crystal growth need to be developed and tested. However, because of the complexity and variety of different crystal systems, attempts to understand crystal growth in detail have so far relied on developing models that are usually applicable to only one system9,10,11. Such models cannot be used to achieve the wide scope of understanding that is required to create a unified model across crystal types and crystal structures. Here we describe a general approach to understanding and, in theory, predicting the growth of a wide range of crystal types, including the incorporation of defect structures, by simultaneous molecular-scale simulation of crystal habit and surface topology using a unified kinetic three-dimensional partition model. This entails dividing the structure into ‘natural tiles’ or Voronoi polyhedra that are metastable and, consequently, temporally persistent. As such, these units are then suitable for re-construction of the crystal via a Monte Carlo algorithm. We demonstrate our approach by predicting the crystal growth of a diverse set of crystal types, including zeolites, metal–organic frameworks, calcite, urea and l-cystine."

In addition to its hypoglycemic effect, metformin has an anti-inflammatory function, but the precise mechanism promoting this activity remains unclear. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an alarmin that is released from necrotic cells and induces inflammatory responses by its cytokine-like activity and is, therefore, a target of anti-inflammatory therapies. Here we identified HMGB1 as a novel metformin-binding protein by affinity purification using a biotinylated metformin analogue. Metformin directly bound to the C-terminal acidic tail of HMGB1. Both in vitro and in vivo, metformin inhibited inflammatory responses induced by full-length HMGB1 but not by HMGB1 lacking the acidic tail. In an acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury model in which HMGB1 released from injured cells exacerbates the initial injury, metformin effectively reduced liver injury and had no additional inhibitory effects when the extracellular HMGB1 was blocked by anti-HMGB1-neutralizing antibody. In summary, we report for the first time that metformin suppresses inflammation by inhibiting the extracellular activity of HMGB1. Because HMGB1 plays a major role in inflammation, our results suggest possible new ways to manage HMGB1-induced inflammation. Metformin is the first-line drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

However, its precise anti-inflammatory mechanism remains unclear. Endogenous molecules released from damaged cells, termed alarmins, enhance inflammation that subsequently exacerbates the initial injury (20Kono H. Rock K.L.

Furthermore, inhibition of HMGB1 has been demonstrated to ameliorate various diseases in animal models as administration of anti-HMGB1 antibody inhibited traumatic brain injury (27Okuma Y. Liu K.

These data provoke interest in HMGB1 as an attractive target for the development of new therapeutic agents for inflammation-related diseases (29Yang H. Ochani M. Li J. Qiang X. Tanovic M. Harris H.E.

In this study we identified HMGB1 as a novel metformin-binding protein and demonstrated that metformin inhibited cytokine activity of HMGB1 in vitro and in vivo. This is the first report of an extracellular function of metformin that regulates inflammation induced by HMGB1. To identify unknown targets of metformin, we performed affinity chromatography by using a biotinylated compound containing metformin-like biguanide structure immobilized on avidin beads (hereafter called metformin beads) (Fig. 1A) and rat liver cytosol. As shown in Fig. 1B, we specifically detected an ∼25-kDa protein in the eluate of the metformin beads but not in that of the control beads. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed the protein was HMGB1. HMGB1 in the cytosolic fraction of HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells was also bound to the metformin beads, and their association was competitively inhibited by metformin in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). We prepared purified recombinant HMGB1 using the baculovirus expression system. The recombinant HMGB1 bound to the metformin beads (Fig. 1D), indicating that their association was direct. The binding of recombinant HMGB1 to the metformin beads was concentration-dependently inhibited in the presence of metformin and also phenformin, another biguanide derivative, but not other amide-containing compounds such as putrescine and 6-aminohexanoic acid (Fig. 1D). Thus, the interaction of HMGB1 was specific to the biguanide structure. HMGB1 contains three major functional domains: A box domain at the N terminus, B box domain in the middle that possesses cytokine activity, and a C-terminal acidic tail domain consisting of 30 acidic amino acids (32Huang W. Tang Y. Li L. HMGB1, a potent proinflammatory cytokine in sepsis.Cytokine. 2010; 51: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 33Tang D. Kang R. Zeh 3rd, H.J. Lotze M.T. High-mobility group box 1, oxidative stress, and disease.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1315-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). To determine the binding site of metformin, we prepared recombinant proteins of full-length HMGB1, A box, B box, an acidic tail, acidic tail-deleted HMGB1 (HMGB1-ΔAT) and A box-deleted HMGB1 (HMGB1-ΔA box) (Fig. 2A). Then we performed a pulldown assay with the metformin beads. As shown in Fig. 2B, HMGB1 mutants containing the acidic tail (full-length HMGB1, acidic tail and HMGB1-ΔA box) clearly bound to the metformin beads, whereas mutants lacking the acidic tail (A box, B box, and HMGB1-ΔAT) did not. The association between recombinant full-length HMGB1 and the metformin beads was concentration-dependently inhibited in the presence of the acidic tail but not HMGB1-ΔAT (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that metformin bound to the acidic tail of HMGB1. HMGB1 induces proinflammatory cytokine production such as TNFα through stimulating receptors such as TLR4 and activation of p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and NFκB pathway inside cells (32Huang W. Tang Y. Li L. HMGB1, a potent proinflammatory cytokine in sepsis.Cytokine. 2010; 51: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 33Tang D. Kang R. Zeh 3rd, H.J. Lotze M.T. High-mobility group box 1, oxidative stress, and disease.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1315-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In the present study we focused on p38 phosphorylation as a cellular signaling response induced by HMGB1. Full-length HMGB1 or HMGB1-ΔAT at 1 μg/ml (∼40 nm) clearly induced p38 phosphorylation in RAW264.7 macrophage cells after incubation at 37 °C for 1 h (Fig. 3, A and B). This phosphorylation was strongly inhibited by a TLR4 inhibitor, TAK-242 (supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting that HMGB1 activates p38 mainly through TLR4 in RAW264.7 cells. Preincubation with metformin inhibited HMGB1-induced p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B). It is noted that the inhibition was preincubation time-dependent (Fig. 3, A and B). In the same experiment, AMPK phosphorylation was not significantly increased by metformin (Fig. 3, A and C), probably due to short incubation periods. These results indicated that metformin inhibited the HMGB1-TLR4 pathway independently of AMPK activation. Metformin concentration-dependently inhibited p38 phosphorylation induced by full-length HMGB1 but not that induced by HMGB1-ΔAT (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar results were obtained with mouse peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 5, A and B). As expected, metformin did not affect p38 phosphorylation induced by LPS, a direct TLR4 agonist (Figs. 4, A, and B, and 5, A and B). Again, in these conditions metformin did not alter AMPK phosphorylation levels (Figs. 4, A, and C, and 5, A and C). Thus, metformin specifically inhibited HMGB1-induced p38 phosphorylation in RAW264.7 cells as well as mouse peritoneal macrophages through direct interaction with the acidic tail of HMGB1.Figure 5Metformin inhibited HMGB1-induced p38 phosphorylation in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Mouse peritoneal macrophages from Balb/c mice were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 1 μg/ml full-length HMGB1 or 1 μg/ml HMGB1-ΔAT in the absence or presence of 3 mm metformin. HMGB1 or HMGB1-ΔAT was preincubated without or with metformin at 4 °C for 24 h before the addition to cells.

Once released from cells, fully reduced HMGB1 is gradually oxidized to become disulfide HMGB1 with a disulfide bond between Cys-23 and Cys-45 in the A box domain (33Tang D. Kang R. Zeh 3rd, H.J.

Disulfide HMGB1 has proinflammatory cytokine activity, whereas fully-reduced HMGB1 does not (34Yang H. Lundbäck P. Ottosson L. Erlandsson-Harris H. Venereau E. Bianchi M.E. Al-Abed Y. Andersson U.

Med. 2012; 209: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). To clarify the molecular mechanism by which metformin inhibited HMGB1, we examined the redox states of HMGB1 by gel electrophoresis (35Venereau E. Casalgrandi M. Schiraldi M. Antoine D.J. Cattaneo A. De Marchis F. Liu J. Antonelli A. Preti A. Raeli L. Shams S.S. Yang H. Varani L. Andersson U. Tracey K.J. et al.Mutually exclusive redox forms of HMGB1 promote cell recruitment or proinflammatory cytokine release.J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The recombinant HMGB1 used in our experiments was in the disulfide form, as β-mercaptoethanol (2-ME)-treated fully-reduced HMGB1 clearly migrated slower (Fig. 6A) as described previously (35Venereau E. Casalgrandi M. Schiraldi M. Antoine D.J. Cattaneo A. De Marchis F. Liu J. Antonelli A. Preti A. Raeli L. Shams S.S. Yang H. Varani L. Andersson U. Tracey K.J. et al.Mutually exclusive redox forms of HMGB1 promote cell recruitment or proinflammatory cytokine release.J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). After the incubation of HMGB1 with metformin at 4 °C for 1 h or 24 h, metformin did not alter the migration velocity of HMGB1, indicating that HMGB1 was not reduced by metformin (Fig. 6A). The data also demonstrated that HMGB1 was not degraded by incubation with metformin (Fig. 6A). We then examined whether metformin bound to HMGB1 with a covalent linkage such as an amide bond. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the molecular weight of HMGB1 was not altered after incubation with metformin at 4 °C for 24 h (Fig. 6B). Thus, we could not detect changes in the redox state or in the molecular weight of HMGB1 after incubation with metformin. We then examined the effect of metformin on TNFα production induced by HMGB1 in vivo (32Huang W. Tang Y. Li L. HMGB1, a potent proinflammatory cytokine in sepsis.Cytokine. 2010; 51: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 33Tang D. Kang R. Zeh 3rd, H.J. Lotze M.T. High-mobility group box 1, oxidative stress, and disease.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1315-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7A, intraperitoneal administration of HMGB1 or HMGB1-ΔAT markedly increased serum TNFα levels after 2 h. Simultaneous administration of metformin inhibited HMGB1-induced elevation of TNFα levels by ∼40% but did not inhibit HMGB1-ΔAT induced elevation. When HMGB1 was preincubated with metformin at 4 °C for 24 h, the increase of TNFα levels induced by HMGB1 was more strongly inhibited, as was the case with in vitro experiments shown in Fig. 3. It is noted that metformin did not inhibit the HMGB1-ΔAT-induced increase of TNFα levels even after preincubation at 4 °C for 24 h. Thus, metformin inhibited HMGB1-induced elevation of TNFα in vivo through interaction with the acidic tail of HMGB1. As expected, metformin did not inhibit LPS-induced TNFα elevation (Fig. 7B), suggesting that the inhibition of TNFα elevation is specifically due to the binding of metformin with HMGB1. Acetaminophen overdose is well known to cause drug-induced liver injury where HMGB1 has been demonstrated to be an essential alarmin in the aggravation of the liver damage through enhancement of inflammation (36Huebener P. Pradere J.P. Hernandez C. Gwak G.Y. Caviglia J.M. Mu X. Loike J.D. Jenkins R.E. Antoine D.J. Schwabe R.F. The HMGB1/RAGE axis triggers neutrophil-mediated injury amplification following necrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In contrast, metformin has been demonstrated to reduce acetaminophen-induced liver injury (16Kim Y.H. Hwang J.H. Kim K.S. Noh J.R. Choi D.H. Kim D.K. Tadi S. Yim Y.H. Choi H.S. Lee C.H. Metformin ameliorates acetaminophen hepatotoxicity via Gadd45β-dependent regulation of JNK signaling in mice.J. Hepatol. 2015; 63: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the final sets of experiments, we examined whether metformin can inhibit endogenous HMGB1 in the acetaminophen intoxication. Metformin as well as anti-HMGB1-neutralizing monoclonal antibody efficiently suppressed the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), a specific marker of hepatocellular damage, by ∼70% (Fig. 8A), and reduced the damaged area in liver parenchyma to a similar extent (Fig. 8B). Under the condition that extracellular HMGB1 was blocked by the anti-HMGB1-neutralizing antibody, metformin did not additionally ameliorate acetaminophen-induced liver injury and vice versa (Fig. 8). It has been demonstrated that metformin ameliorates the acetaminophen-induced liver injury by inducing gene expression of a JNK inhibiting factor, Gadd45β (16Kim Y.H. Hwang J.H. Kim K.S. Noh J.R. Choi D.H. Kim D.K. Tadi S. Yim Y.H. Choi H.S. Lee C.H. Metformin ameliorates acetaminophen hepatotoxicity via Gadd45β-dependent regulation of JNK signaling in mice.J. Hepatol. 2015; 63: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similar to the previous report (16Kim Y.H. Hwang J.H. Kim K.S. Noh J.R. Choi D.H. Kim D.K. Tadi S. Yim Y.H. Choi H.S. Lee C.H. Metformin ameliorates acetaminophen hepatotoxicity via Gadd45β-dependent regulation of JNK signaling in mice.J. Hepatol. 2015; 63: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), metformin showed a tendency to induce Gadd45β expression while administration of anti-HMGB1 antibody also induced it (supplemental Fig. 2). Importantly, again, this effect of anti-HMGB1 antibody was not enhanced by metformin (supplemental Fig. 2). Then, we examined whether HMGB1 targets hepatocytes using human hepatocyte cell lines. As shown in supplemental Fig. 3, recombinant HMGB1 did not induce cell injury in HepG2 hepatocytes. Although acetaminophen induced injury in the cells, the addition of recombinant HMGB1 did not increase the number of injured cells, and anti-HMGB1-neutralizing antibody did not decrease it. Furthermore, HMGB1 did not induce p38 phosphorylation in HepG2 and HuH7 hepatocytes but efficiently induced it in RAW264.7 macrophage cells under the same conditions (supplemental Fig. 4). These results suggest that the main target of HMGB1 is not hepatocytes but inflammatory cells as reported previously (36Huebener P. Pradere J.P. Hernandez C. Gwak G.Y. Caviglia J.M. Mu X. Loike J.D. Jenkins R.E. Antoine D.J. Schwabe R.F. The HMGB1/RAGE axis triggers neutrophil-mediated injury amplification following necrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus, metformin ameliorated acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice most likely through interacting with extracellular HMGB1 and inhibiting HMGB1 cytokine activity. Metformin has been demonstrated to possess an anti-inflammatory function besides its hypoglycemic effect (29Yang H. Ochani M. Li J. Qiang X. Tanovic M. Harris H.E. Susarla S.M. Ulloa L. Wang H.

https://openalex.org/W2605170081,"Astrocytes are a major cell type in the mammalian CNS. Astrocytes are now known to play a number of essential roles in processes including synapse formation and function, as well as blood-brain barrier formation and control of cerebral blood flow. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying astrocyte development and function is still rudimentary. This lack of knowledge is at least partly due to the lack of tools currently available for astrocyte biology. ACSA-2 is a commercially available antibody originally developed for the isolation of astrocytes from young postnatal mouse brain, using magnetic cell-sorting methods, but its utility in isolating cells from adult tissue has not yet been published. Using a modified protocol, we now show that this tool can also be used to isolate ultrapure astrocytes from the adult brain. Furthermore, using a variety of techniques (including single-cell sequencing, overexpression and knockdown assays, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry), we identify the ACSA-2 epitope for the first time as ATP1B2 and characterize its distribution in the CNS. Finally, we show that ATP1B2 is stably expressed in multiple models of CNS injury and disease. Hence, we show that the ACSA-2 antibody possesses the potential to be an extremely valuable tool for astrocyte research, allowing the purification and characterization of astrocytes (potentially including injury and disease models) without the need for any specialized and expensive equipment. In fact, our results suggest that ACSA-2 should be a first-choice method for astrocyte isolation and characterization."

Microglia express all essential purinergic elements such as receptors, nucleoside transporters and ecto-enzymes, including CD39 (NTPDase1) and CD73 (5'-nucleotidase), which sequentially degrade extracellular ATP to adenosine. Here, we show that constitutive deletion of CD39 and CD73 or both caused an inhibition of the microglia ramified phenotype in the brain with a reduction in the length of processes, branching frequency and number of intersections with Sholl spheres. In vitro, unlike wild-type microglia, cd39-/- and cd73-/- microglial cells were less complex and did not respond to ATP with the transformation into a more ramified phenotype. In acute brain slices, wild-type microglia retracted approximately 50% of their processes within 15 min after slicing of the brain, and this phenomenon was augmented in cd39-/- mice; moreover, the elongation of microglial processes towards the source of ATP or towards a laser lesion was observed only in wild-type but not in cd39-/- microglia. An elevation of extracellular adenosine 1) by the inhibition of adenosine transport with dipyridamole, 2) by application of exogenous adenosine or 3) by degradation of endogenous ATP/ADP with apyrase enhanced spontaneous and ATP-induced ramification of cd39-/- microglia in acute brain slices and facilitated the transformation of cd39-/- and cd73-/- microglia into a ramified process-bearing phenotype in vitro. These data indicate that under normal physiological conditions, CD39 and CD73 nucleotidases together with equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) control the fate of extracellular adenosine and thereby the ramification of microglial processes."

Although their mechanisms of drug resistance are well studied, the virulence factors that govern Acinetobacter pathogenesis are incompletely characterized.

For decades, the causative agent behind Acinetobacter infections was almost exclusively reported as Acinetobacter baumannii; however, Acinetobacter taxonomy has undergone major modifications over the last several years. Specifically, we now know that medically relevant Acinetobacter spp. predominately come from a single group, designated the Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) group, given their close genetic relatedness and indistinguishability at the phenotypic level when examined in clinical laboratories. Members of the Ab group include A. baumannii, Acinetobacter nosocomialis, Acinetobacter pittii, Acinetobacter seifertii, and Acinetobacter dijkshoorniae, all of which act as opportunistic pathogens and acquire MDR phenotypes (5Nemec A.

Nevertheless, A. baumannii still remains the most comprehensively studied member of the Ab group, with A. nosocomialis a distant second. Although our understanding of the mechanisms that mediate MDR phenotypes is quite comprehensive (8Roca I. Espinal P. Vila-Farrés X. Vila J.

The role of secretion systems in Acinetobacter virulence has been receiving more and more attention because of their importance in other clinically relevant pathogens. Multiple secretion systems, including a type II secretion system (T2SS), a type V secretion system (T5SS), and a T6SS, have all been characterized and attributed specific roles in the pathobiology of Acinetobacter (9Johnson T.L.

The T6SS, not yet linked directly to eukaryotic pathology, is responsible for killing bacteria and commonly found to be active in clinical isolates extracted from polymicrobial infections, indicating that it may impart a fitness advantage in vivo (15Weber B.S.

Lastly, type IV pili (T4P), bacterial grappling hooks evolutionarily related to the T2SS, have also been characterized in Acinetobacter for their role in natural transformation, motility, and biofilm formation (17Harding C.M. Tracy E.N. Carruthers M.D. Rather P.N. Actis L.A. Munson Jr., R.S.

Given the extensive genetic variation of Acinetobacter spp. and our lack of a thorough understanding of their molecular pathogenesis, we hypothesized that other unrecognized secreted factors may be contributing toward Acinetobacter fitness and virulence. To this end, we bioinformatically identified, in Ab group member genomes, a T1SS and contact-dependent inhibition (CDI) systems. The T1SS of Acinetobacter is homologous to the prototypical TolC-HlyD-HlyB system from Escherichia coli for export of the hemolysin HlyA (19Thomas S. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. The type 1 secretion pathway: the hemolysin system and beyond.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843: 1629-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This three-component secretion system requires an inner membrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, a periplasmic adaptor protein (PAP), and an outer membrane protein channel (20Holland I.B. Peherstorfer S. Kanonenberg K. Lenders M. Reimann S. Schmitt L. Type I protein secretion: deceptively simple yet with a wide range of mechanistic variability across the family.EcoSal Plus. 2016; 7: ESP-0019-2015Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In E. coli, TolC acts as the outer membrane protein and forms a homotrimer that embeds into the outer membrane, extending far into the periplasmic space, where it can interact with the periplasmic adaptor protein HlyD (21Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Crystal structure of the bacterial membrane protein TolC central to multidrug efflux and protein export.Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The periplasmic adaptor protein HlyD, anchored by a transmembrane domain within the inner membrane (22Wang R.C. Seror S.J. Blight M. Pratt J.M. Broome-Smith J.K. Holland I.B.

Biol. 2001; 313: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The ABC transporter HlyB, also embedded within the inner membrane, hydrolyzes ATP to provide the energy required for export of a specific T1SS substrate (22Wang R.C. Seror S.J. Blight M. Pratt J.M. Broome-Smith J.K. Holland I.B.

Together, these proteins act to facilitate the secretion of unfolded effectors directly from the cytoplasm to the extracellular environment. CDI systems, first discovered in 2005 (24Aoki S.K. Pamma R. Hernday A.D. Bickham J.E. Braaten B.A. Low D.A. Contact-dependent inhibition of growth in Escherichia coli.Science. 2005; 309: 1245-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), constitute a tripartite mechanism for inhibiting the growth of neighboring bacteria independent from T6SS. Both CdiB and CdiA are considered to be T5SS, where the outer membrane pore-forming CdiB protein facilities the export of a CdiA toxin to the cell surface. CdiA toxins are polymorphic, usually containing multiple filamentous hemagglutinin domains in the N-terminal region and a C-terminal toxin domain. The third component, the CdiI protein, acts as an immunity protein preventing autoinhibition. Immunity proteins commonly contain domains associated with the SUKH superfamily (25Zhang D. Iyer L.M. Aravind L. A novel immunity system for bacterial nucleic acid degrading toxins and its recruitment in various eukaryotic and DNA viral systems.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 4532-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A fourth component, the toxin receptor, is also required for CDI killing; however, these are not intuitively identifiable and are not associated with cdiBAI loci. To date, only a handful of other CDI systems (Dickeya dadantii (26Aoki S.K. Diner E.J. de Roodenbeke C.T. Burgess B.R. Poole S.J. Braaten B.A. Jones A.M. Webb J.S. Hayes C.S. Cotter P.A. Low D.A.

Here, utilizing a quantitative, differential proteomics technique paired with bioinformatics, we report the complete secretome of A. nosocomialis strain M2 and simultaneously identify two previously unrecognized secretion systems across medically relevant Acinetobacter species. Previously, we demonstrated that A. nosocomialis strain M2 (formerly designated A. baumannii strain M2 (30Carruthers M.D. Harding C.M. Baker B.D. Bonomo R.A. Hujer K.M. Rather P.N. Munson Jr., R.S. Draft genome sequence of the clinical isolate Acinetobacter nosocomialis strain M2.Genome Announc. 2013; 1: e00906-e00913Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) has a functioning T2SS that secretes multiple effectors, including the metalloprotease CpaA (10Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, given that strain M2 also encodes for a functioning T6SS (12Carruthers M.D. Nicholson P.A. Tracy E.N. Munson Jr., R.S. Acinetobacter baumannii utilizes a type VI secretion system for bacterial competition.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8e59388Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that other secretion systems not yet characterized may also be contributing to the secreted protein profile. Using a BLASTp search, we identified homologs of the T1SS components tolC, hlyB, and hlyD from E. coli (Fig. 1A). To determine whether this putative system was contributing toward the secreted protein profile in strain M2, we constructed a tolC-hlyB-hlyD::kan mutant (T1SS mutant). Using one-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis, we found that the T1SS mutant exhibited an altered secreted protein profile, as evidenced by the absence of high-molecular-weight proteins at 70, 130, and 250 kDa compared with the parent (Fig. 1B). Importantly, the complemented strain displayed a secreted protein profile nearly identical to the parental strain, indicating that the absence of the tolC-hlyB-hlyD gene cluster was responsible for the observed phenotype (Fig. 1B). Next, we sought to further characterize these differences and simultaneously define the complete secretome of strain M2 in minimal medium. To define the complete secretome and simultaneously identify differentially secreted proteins between strain M2 and the T1SS mutant, we utilized a quantitative proteomics approach. Briefly, we enriched for secreted proteins from each strain using bacteria grown to mid-log in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% casamino acids. This method eliminated the use of rich medium containing high concentrations of yeast proteins as well as limited cellular lysis contaminants found in stationary-phase bacterial cultures. Using dimethyl labeling of enzymatically digested peptides obtained from the secreted protein fractions of each strain, we were then able to compare the relative quantities of all secreted proteins in pairwise fashions. Four biological samples were prepared for each strain and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures” prior to LC/MS analysis. Isotopically labeled samples were then pooled, and the four biological dimethylation triplex experiments were analyzed by LC/MS. A sample of each replicate for each strain was run on an SDS-PAGE gel, silver-stained, and found to have similar loadings and reflected the overall secretion trend observed in Fig. 1 (supplemental Fig. 1). First we compiled a list of the top secreted proteins from the wild-type M2. Our list was ranked based on proteins with the highest number of unique identified peptides (arbitrarily cut off at 20 for Fig. 1C). The complete list of proteins can be found in the supplemental Mass Spectrometry Table. We identified components of the T6SS and the T2SS, which was expected given previous characterizations of these systems in pathogenic Acinetobacter spp. Furthermore, we identified proteins putatively associated with the T1SS and a CDI system, both of which are discussed in detail below. Using the Log2 ratio of high-confidence proteins (defined as proteins with ≥13 unique identified peptides) observed across replicates, we were able to identify multiple proteins that were significantly and differentially secreted by the wild type compared with the T1SS mutant (Fig. 2A). As expected, the top differentially secreted protein between the parent and the T1SS mutant was a predicted T1SS protein based on the presence of the type I secretion C-terminal target domain (VC_A0849) in the C terminus of the M215_09430 open reading frame. The M215_09430 locus encodes for a protein containing multiple peptidase M10 serralysin C-terminal domains, a Ca2+-binding protein RTX toxin-related domain, and the type I secretion C-terminal target domain (VC_A0849 subclass). For simplicity, we will refer to M215_09430 as the RTX protein. We also identified a second protein containing a type I secretion C-terminal target domain, M215_01695, which was significantly and differentially secreted between the wild type and T1SS mutant. The M215_1695 locus encodes for a large protein predicted to contain multiple group 3 bacterial Ig-like domains (pfam13754) and a type I secretion C-terminal target domain (VC_A0848). Given its homology to biofilm-associated proteins (Baps) in A. baumannii, this protein was designated the Bap ortholog in A. nosocomialis strain M2. The second most differentially secreted protein between the wild type and the T1SS mutant was M215_02910 (Fig. 2, A and B), a protein predicted to contain multiple group 3 bacterial Ig-like domains (pfam13754) similar to Bap; however, the protein annotation for M215_02910 lacks the type I secretion C-terminal target domain commonly found in T1SS proteins. Recent molecular, in silico, and PCR analyses of bap genes from A. baumannii demonstrate that the bap repetitive elements are prone to alignment errors in genome sequences, resulting in premature truncations and chromosomal rearrangements (31Kodori M. Douraghi M. Yaseri M. Rahbar M. The impact of primer sets on detection of the gene encoding biofilm-associated protein (Bap) in Acinetobacter baumannii: in silico and in vitro analysis.Lett. Appl.

Del Franco M. Martinucci M. Roscetto E. Zarrilli R. Di Nocera P.P. Biofilm-associated proteins: news from Acinetobacter.BMC Genomics. 2015; 16: 933Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Together, this may indicate that M215_02910 is part of the same open reading frame as Bap. Conversely, it is also possible that this open reading frame has been incorrectly aligned and is, in fact, part of the RTX protein, given its similarities to large repetitive RTX proteins (34Satchell K.J. Structure and function of MARTX toxins and other large repetitive RTX proteins.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 65: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Regardless, the presence of peptides from this protein in the secreted fraction of both the wild type and complemented strain strongly correlate with its secretion with the T1SS. Analysis of our proteomics results indicated that proteins without the type I C-terminal targeting domain were also differentially secreted between the wild type and the T1SS mutant. Specifically, multiple T6SS-associated proteins, including three VgrG orthologs and Hcp, were all found at significantly lower levels in the T1SS mutant. Although not nearly as significant, multiple known T2SS-associated proteins, including CpaA, LipH, a rhombosortase, and a rhombotarget, were also found in lower quantities in the T1SS mutant compared with the wild type. Last, a predicted CDI-associated protein was also identified as significantly reduced in the T1SS mutant (discussed in detail below). The full list of differentially secreted proteins can be found in the supplemental Mass Spectrometry Table. For the majority of instances, including the predicted T1SS-associated proteins described above, the dimethylation ratios comparing the secreted proteins from the complemented strain with the parent strain were quite similar, again indicating that the absence of the tolC-hlyB-hlyD genes was responsible for the differential secretion profile in the mutant. It has been shown previously that deletion of tolC can have pleiotropic effects on membrane integrity and cellular physiology in E. coli (35Zgurskaya H.I. Krishnamoorthy G. Ntreh A. Lu S. Mechanism and function of the outer membrane channel TolC in multidrug resistance and physiology of Enterobacteria.Front. Microbiol. 2011; 2: 189Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, we initially hypothesized that the observed differences between the secreted proteins of the parent and T1SS mutant were due to membrane stress associated with the absence of the TolC protein. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism behind the diminished protein profile of the T1SS mutant and more intricately probe the role of tolC, hlyB, and hlyD in the observed phenotypes, we constructed in-frame unmarked mutations in each gene as well as the entire locus. First we validated the quantitative proteomics results by Western blotting across the entire mutant panel in minimal medium. As expected, Hcp expression was found to be similar across all strains tested; however, Hcp secretion was not detected in any of the mutants analyzed when secreted proteins were collected from strains grown in minimal medium (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, when the mutant panel was tested for Hcp secretion from strains grown in rich medium, no differences were observed in Hcp expression or secretion (Fig. 3B). Next we sought to determine whether the cross-talk between the T1SS system and the T6SS was specific or whether disrupting other secretions systems would also abrogate T6SS activity. To this end, we probed for Hcp expression and secretion in a pilD mutant and complemented strain. PilD is the pre-pilin peptidase required for processing of both pilins and pseudopilins for the T4P system and T2SS, respectively. Thus, the absence of pilD results in a T4P- and T2SS-negative phenotype (10Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The pilD mutant displayed no differences in Hcp expression or secretion compared with the parental strain and the complemented strain. Furthermore, this phenotype held true for both rich and minimal medium (Fig. 4, A and B). Given that Bap was one of the most differentially secreted proteins between the wild type and the T1SS full locus mutant, we hypothesized that our unmarked individual T1SS mutants would have impaired ability to form biofilms. Using a microtiter plate biofilm assay, we observed that mutants lacking any or all components of the T1SS have severely reduced ability to form biofilms, as determined by crystal violet staining both 3 and 6 h after inoculation (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). Importantly, we performed biofilm formation assays in rich medium to avoid confounding results from altered secretion of non-T1SS components, like Hcp secretion, as shown in Fig. 3. Nevertheless, the attenuated biofilm phenotype was observed in both rich and minimal medium (data not shown). The biofilm defect was not due to alterations in Csu pili or T4P expression and surface p"

In this study we hypothesized that autonomic dysfunction increases inflammation, which subsequently accelerates atherosclerosis. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association between autonomic tone, inflammation and atherosclerosis.124 men under investigation for carotid atherosclerosis were examined for autonomic function (heart rate variability; HRV and baroreflex sensitivity; BRS), inflammatory markers (white blood cell count; WBCC and C-reactive protein; CRP) and degree of carotid atherosclerosis. The direct or indirect associations between autonomic function, inflammatory parameters and carotid plaque area were investigated with multiple linear regressions.Male subjects with prevalent CVD showed larger carotid plaque area, higher WBCC, and reduced BRS compared to subjects with no history of CVD. Further, BRS was inversely associated with carotid plaque area (r = -0.21, p = 0.018) as well as inflammatory parameters WBCC and CRP (r = -0.29, p = 0.001, and r = -0.23, p = 0.009, respectively), whereas HRV only was inversely associated with WBCC (r = -0.22, p = 0.014). To investigate if inflammation could provide a link between autonomic function and carotid atherosclerosis we adjusted the associations accordingly. After adjusting for WBCC and CRP the inverse association between BRS and carotid plaque area was attenuated and did not remain significant, while both WBCC and CRP remained significantly associated with carotid plaque area, indicating that low-grade inflammation can possibly link BRS to atherosclerosis. Also, after adjusting for age, antihypertensive treatment and cardiovascular risk factors, BRS was independently inversely associated with both WBCC and CRP, and HRV independently inversely associated with WBCC. WBCC was the only inflammatory marker independently associated with carotid plaque area after adjustment.We demonstrate that autonomic dysfunction is associated with atherosclerosis and that inflammation could play an important role in mediating this relationship."

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of different sized meals on liver stiffness. Liver and spleen stiffness was measured with transient elastography (TE) and real-time 2-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE). Patients ingested a 625 kcal and a 1250 kcal liquid meal on two consecutive days. We measured liver and spleen elasticity, Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and portal flow at baseline and after 20, 40, 60, 120 and 180 minutes. Sixty patients participated, 83% with alcoholic liver disease. Twenty-eight patients had METAVIR fibrosis score F0-3 and 32 patients had cirrhosis. Liver stiffness, spleen stiffness and CAP increased after both meals for all stages of fibrosis. False positive 2D-SWE liver stiffness measurements caused 36% and 52% of patients with F0-3 fibrosis to be misclassified with higher stages of fibrosis after the moderate and high caloric meal. Likewise, 10% and 13% of compensated cirrhosis patients were misclassified with clinically significant portal hypertension after the two meals. We observed similar misclassification rates with TE. After three hours, liver stiffness remained elevated more than 20% from baseline in up to 50% of patients. In conclusion: Liver stiffness, spleen stiffness and CAP increase after a meal across all stages of fibrosis and across elastography techniques. Up to half of patients may be misclassified with higher stages of fibrosis, if they are assessed after less than three hours fasting period."
https://openalex.org/W2604630852,"Inflammasomes are cytoplasmic sensors that regulate the activity of caspase-1 and the secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) or interleukin-18 (IL-18) in response to foreign molecules, including viral pathogens. They are considered to be an important link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. However, the mechanism by which inflammasome activation occurs during primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection remains unknown. Human B lymphocytes and epithelial cells are major targets of EBV, although it can also infect a variety of other cell types. In this study, we found that EBV could infect primary human monocytes and the monocyte cell line, THP-1, inducing inflammasome activation. We incubated cell-free EBV with THP-1 cells or primary human monocytes, then confirmed EBV infection using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Lytic and latent EBV genes were detected by real-time RT-PCR in EBV-infected monocytes. EBV infection of THP-1 cells and primary human monocytes induced caspase-dependent IL-1β production, while EBV infection of B-cell or T-cell lines did not induce IL-1β production. To identify the sensor molecule responsible for inflammasome activation during EBV infection, we examined the mRNA and the protein levels of NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), and interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16). Increased AIM2 levels were observed in EBV-infected THP-1 cells and primary human monocytes, whereas levels of IFI16 and NLRP3 did not show remarkable change. Furthermore, knockdown of AIM2 by small interfering RNA attenuated caspase-1 activation. Taken together, our results suggest that EBV infection of human monocytes induces caspase-1-dependent IL-1β production, and that AIM2, acting as an inflammasome, is involved in this response."

The Uganda Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) 2014-15 was the second nationally representative survey conducted to provide estimates of malaria prevalence among children less than 5 years, and to track the progress of control interventions in the country. In this present study, 2014-15 MIS data were analysed to assess intervention effects on malaria prevalence in Uganda among children less than 5 years, assess intervention effects at regional level, and estimate geographical distribution of malaria prevalence in the country.Bayesian geostatistical models with spatially varying coefficients were used to determine the effect of interventions on malaria prevalence at national and regional levels. Spike-and-slab variable selection was used to identify the most important predictors and forms. Bayesian kriging was used to predict malaria prevalence at unsampled locations.Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) and Insecticide Treated Nets (ITN) ownership had a significant but varying protective effect on malaria prevalence. However, no effect was observed for Artemisinin Combination-based Therapies (ACTs). Environmental factors, namely, land cover, rainfall, day and night land surface temperature, and area type were significantly associated with malaria prevalence. Malaria prevalence was higher in rural areas, increased with the child's age, and decreased with higher household socioeconomic status and higher level of mother's education. The highest prevalence of malaria in children less than 5 years was predicted for regions of East Central, North East and West Nile, whereas the lowest was predicted in Kampala and South Western regions, and in the mountainous areas in Mid-Western and Mid-Eastern regions.IRS and ITN ownership are important interventions against malaria prevalence in children less than 5 years in Uganda. The varying effects of the interventions calls for selective implementation of control tools suitable to regional ecological settings. To further reduce malaria burden and sustain malaria control in Uganda, current tools should be supplemented by health system strengthening, and socio-economic development."

Location Australian tropics: Australian Monsoon Tropics and Australian Wet Tropics. Methods The presence or absence of 6,861 plant species was scored across 13 putative biogeographic barriers in the Australian Tropics, including two that have not previously been recognised. Randomizations of these data were used to test whether more species showed disjunctions (gaps in distribution) or likely barriers (range limits) at these points than expected by chance. Results Two novel disjunctions in the Australian Tropics flora are identified in addition to eleven putative barriers previously recognized for animals. Of these, eleven disjunction points (all within the Australian Monsoon Tropics) were found to correspond to range-ending barriers to a significant number of species, while neither of the two disjunctions found within the Australian Wet Tropics limited a significant number of species’ ranges. Main conclusions Biogeographic barriers present significant distributional limits to native plant species in the Australian Monsoon Tropics but not in the Australian Wet Tropics."

Furthermore, whether the relationship of obesity and overweight with lung function and FeNO in children is modified by atopy is unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of excess weight on lung function parameters and FeNO among Asian children, with a particular focus on exploring the potential effect modification by atopy.We investigated the effect of excess weight on lung function and FeNO in a population sample of 1,717 children aged 5 to 18 years and explored the potential modifying effect of atopy.There were positive associations of body mass index (BMI) z-score with forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and forced expiratory flow at 25-75% (FEF25-75) (all P<0.001), after controlling for confounders. The beta coefficient for FEV1 (0.084) was smaller than that for FVC (0.111). In contrast, a negative association was found between BMI z-score and FEV1/FVC ratio (P<0.001) and FeNO (P = 0.03). A consistent pattern of association for lung function variables was observed when stratifying by atopy. There was a negative association of BMI z-score with FeNO in atopic subjects (P = 0.006), but not in non-atopic subjects (P = 0.46).Excess weight disproportionately impacts lung volumes and airflow in children from the general population, independent of atopic status. Excess weight inversely affects FeNO in atopic but not in non-atopic children."
https://openalex.org/W2604622155,"The glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) gene is a pivotal mediator of the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids (GCs) that are known to regulate the function of both adaptive and innate immunity cells. Our aim was to investigate the role of GILZ in GC-induced inhibition of neutrophil migration, as this role has not been investigated before. We found that GILZ expression was induced by dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic GC, in neutrophils, and that it regulated migration of these cells into inflamed tissues under DEX treatment. Of note, inhibition of neutrophil migration was not observed in GILZ-knockout mice with peritonitis that were treated by DEX. This was because DEX was unable to up-regulate annexin A1 (Anxa1) expression in the absence of GILZ. Furthermore, we showed that GILZ mediates Anxa1 induction by GCs by transactivating Anxa1 expression at the promoter level via binding with the transcription factor, PU.1. The present findings shed light on the role of GILZ in the mechanism of induction of Anxa1 by GCs. As Anxa1 is an important protein for the resolution of inflammatory response, GILZ may represent a new pharmacologic target for treatment of inflammatory diseases.-Ricci, E., Ronchetti, S., Pericolini, E., Gabrielli, E., Cari, L., Gentili, M., Roselletti, E., Migliorati, G., Vecchiarelli, A., Riccardi, C.

https://openalex.org/W2604209547,"The removal of unwanted or damaged cells by phagocytes is achieved via a finely regulated cleaning process called efferocytosis. To characterize the mechanisms through which phagocytes control the intake of apoptotic cells, we investigated how the phagocyte's appetite for engulfed cells may be coordinated by RhoA and Rac1 in the phagocytic cup. We used FRET biosensors to visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of Rho-family GTPases, and found that RhoA, which is known to be downregulated during phagocytosis, was transiently upregulated at the phagocytic cup immediately prior to ingestion. Conversely, Rac1 was upregulated during the engulfment process and then downregulated prior to phagosomal maturation. Moreover, disturbance of the dynamic activities of RhoA led to uncontrolled engulfment, such as fast and undiscerning eating. Our results reveal that the temporal activity of RhoA GTPase alters the Rac1/RhoA balance at the phagocytic cup prior to ingestion, and that this plays a distinct role in orchestrating efferocytosis, with RhoA modulating the rate of engulfment to ensure that the phagocyte engulfs an appropriate amount of the correct material."
https://openalex.org/W2604980247,"Reverse cholesterol transport (transfer of macrophage-cholesterol in the subendothelial space of the arterial wall to the liver) is terminated by selective high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesteryl ester (CE) uptake, mediated by scavenger receptor class B, type 1 (SR-B1). We tested the validity of two models for this process: gobbling, i.e. one-step transfer of all HDL-CE to the cell and multiple successive cycles of SR-B1-HDL association during which a few CEs transfer to the cell. Concurrently, we compared cellular uptake of apoAI with that of apoAII, which is more lipophilic than apoAI, using HDL-[3H]CE labeled with [125I]apoAI or [125I]apoAII. The studies were conducted in CHO-K1 and CHO-ldlA7 cells (LDLR-/-) with (CHO-SR-B1) and without SR-B1 overexpression and in human Huh7 hepatocytes. Relative to CE, both apoAI and apoAII were excluded from uptake by all cells. However, apoAII was more highly excluded from uptake (2-4×) than apoAI. To distinguish gobbling versus nibbling mechanisms, media from incubations of HDL with CHO-SR-B1 cells were analyzed by non-denaturing PAGE, size-exclusion chromatography, and the distribution of apoAI, apoAII, cholesterol, and phospholipid among HDL species as a function of incubation time. HDL size gradually decreased, i.e. nibbling, with the concurrent release of lipid-free apoAI; apoAII was retained in an HDL remnant. Our data support an SR-B1 nibbling mechanism that is similar to that of streptococcal serum opacity factor, which also selectively removes CE and releases apoAI, leaving an apoAII-rich remnant."
https://openalex.org/W2604251699,"Prions arise from proteins that have two possible conformations: properly folded and non-infectious or misfolded and infectious. The [PSI+] yeast prion, which is the misfolded and self-propagating form of the translation termination factor eRF3 (Sup35), can be cured of its infectious conformation by overexpression of Hsp104, which helps dissolve the prion seeds. This dissolution depends on the trimming activity of Hsp104, which reduces the size of the prion seeds without increasing their number. To further understand the relationship between trimming and curing, trimming was followed by measuring the loss of GFP-labeled Sup35 foci from both strong and weak [PSI+] variants; the former variant has more seeds and less soluble Sup35 than the latter. Overexpression of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp104 (Sc-Hsp104) trimmed the weak [PSI+] variants much faster than the strong variants and cured the weak variants an order of magnitude faster than the strong variants. Overexpression of the fungal Hsp104 homologs from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp-Hsp104) or Candida albicans (Ca-Hsp104) also trimmed and cured the weak variants, but interestingly, it neither trimmed nor cured the strong variants. These results show that, because Sc-Hsp104 has greater trimming activity than either Ca-Hsp104 or Sp-Hsp104, it cures both the weak and strong variants, whereas Ca-Hsp104 and Sp-Hsp104 only cure the weak variants. Therefore, curing by Hsp104 overexpression depends on both the trimming ability of the fungal Hsp104 homolog and the strength of the [PSI+] variant: the greater the trimming activity of the Hsp104 homolog and the weaker the variant, the greater the curing."

Correction of vitamin D deficiency improved treatment response. Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP IV) involved in inflammatory responses in CHC. Their higher levels at pretreatment of CHC could predict poorer responses. Vitamin D suppressed expression of IP-10 from monocytes in vitro. In CHC patients, DPP IV involved in IP-10 regulation. We hypothesized that correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency in CHC patients might restore immune dysregulation through a pathway linked to the TH1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10 or DPP IV. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 80 CHC patients with vitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL were assigned to receive vitamin D (40) or placebo (40) supplements for 6 weeks. The levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], Th1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10 and DPP IV were measured at baseline and at the 6th week. At the end of study, the mean 25(OH)D level in vitamin D group was significantly increased and normalised. There were no changes in the level of Th1/Th2 cytokines. Our important finding revealed that upon correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, the serum IP-10 and DPP IV levels were decreased significantly as compare to the placebo group (delta changes; 83.27 vs -133.80; 95% CI [-326.910, -40.758], p = 0.0125, and 271.04 vs -518.69; 95% CI [-1179,15, -59.781], p = 0.0305, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2604738116,"The present study examined predictors of emotional problems amongst a nationally representative cohort of recent immigrants in Canada. Specifically, the effects of parenting status were examined given the association between parenting stress and mental health. Data came from the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada (N = 7055). Participants were recruited 6-months post landing (2001–2002) and followed up at 2 and 4 years. Self-reported emotional problems over time were considered as a function of parenting status (Two Parent, Lone Parent, Divorced Non-Parent, Non-Divorced Non-Parent) and sociodemographic characteristics. Odds of emotional problems were higher among Two Parent, OR = 1.12 (1.01, 1.24), Lone Parent, OR = 2.24 (1.75, 2.88), and Divorced Non-Parent, OR = 1.30 (1.01, 1.66) immigrants compared to Non-Divorced Non-Parents. Visible minority status, female gender, low income, and refugee status were associated with elevated risk. Findings reveal that immigrant parents are at risk for emotional health problems during the post-migration period. Such challenges may be compounded by other sociodemographic risk."
https://openalex.org/W2605190057,"In epidemiological studies, exposures of interest are often measured with uncertainties, which may be independent or correlated. Independent errors can often be characterized relatively easily while correlated measurement errors have shared and hierarchical components that complicate the description of their structure. For some important studies, Monte Carlo dosimetry systems that provide multiple realizations of exposure estimates have been used to represent such complex error structures. While the effects of independent measurement errors on parameter estimation and methods to correct these effects have been studied comprehensively in the epidemiological literature, the literature on the effects of correlated errors, and associated correction methods is much more sparse. In this paper, we implement a novel method that calculates corrected confidence intervals based on the approximate asymptotic distribution of parameter estimates in linear excess relative risk (ERR) models. These models are widely used in survival analysis, particularly in radiation epidemiology. Specifically, for the dose effect estimate of interest (increase in relative risk per unit dose), a mixture distribution consisting of a normal and a lognormal component is applied. This choice of asymptotic approximation guarantees that corrected confidence intervals will always be bounded, a result which does not hold under a normal approximation. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the proposed method in survival analysis using a realistic ERR model. We used both simulated Monte Carlo dosimetry systems (MCDS) and actual dose histories from the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System 2013, a MCDS for plutonium exposures in the Mayak Worker Cohort. Results show our proposed methods provide much improved coverage probabilities for the dose effect parameter, and noticeable improvements for other model parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2604121546,"Recent studies support plasticity in adult brain white matter structure and myelination in response to various experiential factors. One possible contributor to this plasticity may be activity-dependent modulation of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (Sgk1) expression in oligodendrocytes. We examined whether Sgk1 expression in adult rat brain white matter is increased by acute stress-induced elevations in endogenous corticosterone and whether it fluctuates with diurnal variations in corticosterone. We observed rapid increases (within 30 min) in Sgk1 mRNA in the corpus callosum in response to acute stress, as well as large increases at the beginning of the rat’s active period (the time of peak corticosterone secretion). These increases were absent in adrenalectomized rats. Corticosterone treatment of adrenalectomized rats also rapidly increased corpus callosum Sgk1 mRNA. The majority of Sgk1 mRNA in corpus callosum was co-localized with myelin basic protein mRNA, suggesting that mature oligodendrocytes respond dynamically to acute stress and circadian rhythms. The regulation of Sgk1 expression by acute stress and time of day was selective for white matter, with limited alteration of Sgk1 expression by these factors in hippocampus and somatosensory cortex. These results indicate a unique sensitivity of oligodendrocyte Sgk1 expression to activity-dependent fluctuations in corticosterone hormone secretion, and raises the prospect that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation or glucocorticoid pharmacotherapy may compromise the normal activity-dependent interactions between oligodendrocytes and neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2605350542,"Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have impaired health-related quality of life including physical and mental state. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a useful tool for evaluation of brain activity and depressive state. This study aimed to determine the brain activity of female NAFLD patients using NIRS. Cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentration during a verbal fluency task (VFT) was measured using NIRS in 24 female NAFLD patients and 15 female healthy controls. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) questionnaire was administered to both groups before NIRS. There was no significant difference in CES-D score between groups. However, the oxy-Hb concentration and number of words during the VFT were less in NAFLD compared to healthy controls. The mean value of oxy-Hb concentration during 0-60 s VFT in the frontal lobe was also smaller in NAFLD patients compared to healthy controls (0.082 ± 0.126 vs. 0.183 ± 0.145, P < 0.001). Cerebral oxygen concentration is poorly reactive in response to VFT in female NAFLD patients. This may indicate an association between decreased brain activity and NAFLD regardless of depression."
https://openalex.org/W2604522302,"Incorporation of ribonucleotides during DNA replication has severe consequences for genome stability. Although eukaryotes possess a number of redundancies for initiating and completing repair of misincorporated ribonucleotides, archaea such as Thermococcus rely only upon RNaseH2 to initiate the pathway. Because Thermococcus DNA polymerases incorporate as many as 1,000 ribonucleotides per genome, RNaseH2 must be efficient at recognizing and nicking at embedded ribonucleotides to ensure genome integrity. Here, we show that ribonucleotides are incorporated by the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis both in vitro and in vivo and a robust ribonucleotide excision repair pathway is critical to keeping incorporation levels low in wild-type cells. Using pre-steady-state and steady-state kinetics experiments, we also show that archaeal RNaseH2 rapidly cleaves at embedded ribonucleotides (200-450 s-1), but exhibits an ∼1,000-fold slower turnover rate (0.06-0.17 s-1), suggesting a potential role for RNaseH2 in protecting or marking nicked sites for further processing. We found that following RNaseH2 cleavage, the combined activities of polymerase B (PolB), flap endonuclease (Fen1), and DNA ligase are required to complete ribonucleotide processing. PolB formed a ribonucleotide-containing flap by strand displacement synthesis that was cleaved by Fen1, and DNA ligase sealed the nick for complete repair. Our study reveals conservation of the overall mechanism of ribonucleotide excision repair across domains of life. The lack of redundancies in ribonucleotide repair in archaea perhaps suggests a more ancestral form of ribonucleotide excision repair compared with the eukaryotic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2604926048,"Vascular regression is essential to remove redundant vessels during the formation of an efficient vascular network that can transport oxygen and nutrient to every corner of the body. However, no mechanism is known to explain how major blood vessels regress during development. Here we use the dorsal part of the caudal vein plexus (dCVP) in Zebrafish to investigate the mechanism of regression and discover a new role of Yap/Taz in vascular regression. During regression, Yap/Taz is activated by blood circulation in the endothelial cells. This leads to induction of Ctgf and actin polymerization. Interference with Yap/Taz activation decreased Ctgf production, which decreased actin polymerization and vascular regression. These results implicate a novel role of Yap/Taz in vascular regression."
https://openalex.org/W2605211420,"Methodologies to measure gender-based violence (GBV) have received inadequate attention, especially in humanitarian contexts where vulnerabilities to violence are exacerbated. This paper compares the results from individual audio computer-assisted self-administered (ACASI) survey interviews with results from participatory social mapping activities, employed with the same sample in two different post-conflict contexts. Eighty-seven internally displaced adolescent girls from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 78 Sudanese girls living in Ethiopian refugee camps were interviewed using the two methodologies. Results revealed that the group-based qualitative method elicited narratives of violence focusing on events perpetrated by strangers or members of the community more distantly connected to girls. In contrast, ACASI interviews revealed violence predominantly perpetrated by family members and intimate partners. These findings suggest that group-based methods of information gathering frequently used in the field may be more susceptible to socially accepted narratives. Specifically, our findings suggest group-based methods may produce results showing that sexual violence perpetrated by strangers (e.g., from armed groups in the conflict) is more prevalent than violence perpetrated by family and intimate partners. To the extent this finding is true, it may lead to a skewed perception that adolescent GBV involving strangers is a more pressing issue than intimate partner and family-based sexual violence, when in fact, both are of great concern."
https://openalex.org/W2604639700,"Defense against biotic or abiotic stresses is one of the benefits of living in symbiosis. Leaf-cutting ants, which live in an obligate mutualism with a fungus, attenuate thermal and desiccation stress of their partner through behavioral responses, by choosing suitable places for fungus-rearing across the soil profile. The underground environment also presents hypoxic (low oxygen) and hypercapnic (high carbon dioxide) conditions, which can negatively influence the symbiont. Here, we investigated whether workers of the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex lundii use the CO2 concentration as an orientation cue when selecting a place to locate their fungus garden, and whether they show preferences for specific CO2 concentrations. We also evaluated whether levels preferred by workers for fungus-rearing differ from those selected for themselves. In the laboratory, CO2 preferences were assessed in binary choices between chambers with different CO2 concentrations, by quantifying number of workers in each chamber and amount of relocated fungus. Leaf-cutting ants used the CO2 concentration as a spatial cue when selecting places for fungus-rearing. A. lundii preferred intermediate CO2 levels, between 1 and 3%, as they would encounter at soil depths where their nest chambers are located. In addition, workers avoided both atmospheric and high CO2 levels as they would occur outside the nest and at deeper soil layers, respectively. In order to prevent fungus desiccation, however, workers relocated fungus to high CO2 levels, which were otherwise avoided. Workers' CO2 preferences for themselves showed no clear-cut pattern. We suggest that workers avoid both atmospheric and high CO2 concentrations not because they are detrimental for themselves, but because of their consequences for the symbiotic partner. Whether the preferred CO2 concentrations are beneficial for symbiont growth remains to be investigated, as well as whether the observed preferences for fungus-rearing influences the ants' decisions where to excavate new chambers across the soil profile."
https://openalex.org/W2604118844,"The accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils in neuronal inclusions is the defining pathological process in Parkinson's disease (PD). A pathogenic role for α-syn fibril accumulation is supported by the identification of dominantly inherited α-syn (SNCA) gene mutations in rare cases of familial PD. Fibril formation involves a spontaneous nucleation event in which soluble α-syn monomers associate to form seeds, followed by fibril growth during which monomeric α-syn molecules sequentially associate with existing seeds. To better investigate this process, we developed sensitive assays that use the fluorescein arsenical dye FlAsH (fluorescein arsenical hairpin binder) to detect soluble oligomers and mature fibrils formed from recombinant α-syn protein containing an N-terminal bicysteine tag (C2-α-syn). Using seed growth by monomer association (SeGMA) assays to measure fibril growth over 3 h in the presence of C2-α-syn monomer, we observed that some familial PD-associated α-syn mutations (i.e. H50Q and A53T) greatly increased growth rates, whereas others (E46K, A30P, and G51D) decreased growth rates. Experiments with wild-type seeds extended by mutant monomer and vice versa revealed that single-amino acid differences between seed and monomer proteins consistently decreased growth rates. These results demonstrate that α-syn monomer association during fibril growth is a highly ordered process that can be disrupted by misalignment of individual amino acids and that only a subset of familial-PD mutations causes fibril accumulation through increased fibril growth rates.

To further characterize structural determinants and mechanisms underlying fibril formation, we developed assays that use the biarsenical dye fluorescein arsenical hairpin binder (FlAsH) to detect the association of two or more α-syn monomers containing bicysteine tags. FlAsH is a profluorescent biarsenical dye that binds to short peptides containing four cysteine residues (37Griffin B.A. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y.

The intermolecular association of two peptides can also be monitored by biarsenical dyes when each of the two peptides contains a peptide tag with two cysteine residues (39Lee J. Culyba E.K.

In this bipartite tetracysteine approach, close association (∼10 Å) of the bicysteine tags in assembled complexes is required to bind FlAsH and induce fluorescence (40Luedtke N.W. Dexter R.J. Fried D.B. Schepartz A. Surveying polypeptide and protein domain conformation and association with FlAsH and ReAsH.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We found that FlAsH has high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of both soluble oligomeric species and fibrils formed by bicysteine-tagged α-syn (C2-α-syn). Additionally, the high sensitivity of FlAsH for oligomeric and fibrillar α-syn can be utilized to establish novel seed growth by monomer association (SeGMA) assays, which measure the rate at which monomer is consecutively added to preformed seeds consisting of either soluble oligomers or fibrils. We examined the effects of α-syn mutations on seed growth rates and found that some PD-associated mutations significantly increase the rate, whereas others significantly decrease the rate. Furthermore, in SeGMA assays in which the sequence of monomer protein differs from the sequence of seeds, we observed that single-amino acid mismatches between seeds and monomer frequently decrease the rate of fibril growth. To determine whether the formation of α-syn fibrils can be detected with a bipartite tetracysteine reporter, we produced recombinant human C2-α-syn protein. We incubated native α-syn and C2-α-syn protein at 37 °C with shaking to form fibrils. The temporal profiles of fibril formation using native α-syn versus C2-α-syn, measured by ThioT fluorescence, were very similar (Fig. 1A), indicating that the bicysteine tag does not alter the rate of fibril formation. We next examined the ability of the FlAsH dye to detect fibril formation and observed a robust increase in fluorescence upon formation of C2-α-syn amyloid fibrils, which paralleled the increase in ThioT fluorescence (Fig. 1B). In contrast, FlAsH fluorescence did not increase in the presence of native WT α-syn fibrils. We further characterized FlAsH detection of C2-α-syn fibrils by combining 25 nm FlAsH with increasing concentrations of C2-α-syn fibrils and measuring fluorescence. Analysis of the data with a saturation binding model indicated that the average apparent affinity constant (Kapp) for association of FlAsH with C2-α-syn fibrils is 27 μg/ml (Fig. 1C). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) verified that native α-syn and C2-α-syn fibrils have similar morphology (Fig. 1, D–G), providing further evidence that the C2 tag does not significantly alter the α-syn fibril formation process. Fibril formation reactions contained freshly added dithiothreitol (DTT) to reduce disulfides formed by cysteine residues. In our early fibril formation experiments performed in the absence of DTT, C2-α-syn formed fibrils at a slightly faster rate compared with native α-syn (data not shown). When DTT was added in subsequent experiments, rates were more similar, as shown in Fig. 1A. To characterize soluble oligomeric α-syn species, we incubated native α-syn and C2-α-syn monomer at 37 °C for 32 h, centrifuged the samples at 100,000 × g, and then fractionated the supernatants using SEC. Western blot (WB) analysis demonstrated that α-syn elutes from the column in two distinct peaks: a high-Mr oligomer peak eluting near the void volume (relative Mr = 1,100,000) and a lower-Mr peak eluting at a relative Mr of 59,000 (Fig. 2, A–C). SEC analysis of recombinant α-syn that was not previously incubated at 37 °C demonstrated only the low-Mr peak. WB analysis indicated that native α-syn and C2-α-syn produced similar levels of high-Mr oligomer species when incubated at 37 °C for 32 h. We analyzed the C2-α-syn SEC fractions in the FlAsH fluorescence assay. We observed increased fluorescence exclusively in high-Mr fractions, corresponding to the α-syn identified by WB in these fractions. Despite the presence of substantially higher levels of α-syn in WB analysis of the low-Mr fractions, there was no increase in FlAsH fluorescence above baseline, confirming both the specificity of the FlAsH assay for high-Mr oligomer species and the absence of oligomeric species in the lower-Mr peak (Fig. 2C). In a separate experiment, we compared the abilities of ThioT and FlAsH to detect soluble oligomers present in SEC fractions from C2-α-syn incubated for 32 h. FlAsH produced a robust increase in fluorescence for high-Mr SEC fractions of incubated C2-α-syn, compared with non-incubated C2-α-syn. In contrast, we did not detect a change in ThioT fluorescence for high-Mr SEC fractions (Fig. 2D) regardless of incubation time. These results demonstrate that FlAsH detects soluble high Mr oligomers that do not bind ThioT. To examine the temporal evolution of oligomeric species, we used FlAsH to analyze SEC fractions obtained after C2-α-syn was incubated for varying lengths of time. Oligomer levels progressively increased with longer incubation times (Fig. 2E). The distribution of FlAsH-positive oligomers was similar among several time points, with significant FlAsH fluorescence present in fractions corresponding to relative Mr values of 440,000 and higher, based on comparison with a Mr standard calibration curve (Fig. 2F). We used AFM to further characterize α-syn oligomers detected by FlAsH. AFM images revealed a combination of spherical and ellipsoid species. Native α-syn (Fig. 2, G and H) and C2-α-syn (Fig. 2, I and J) oligomers displayed similar morphologies. The ability of FlAsH to detect both soluble oligomers and fibrils suggested that it could also quantitatively detect the sequential addition of monomer involved in the conversion of oligomers to mature fibrils. To determine whether SEC-purified oligomers function as seeds that can grow in the presence of monomer, we developed a SeGMA assay (Fig. 3A) in which SEC-purified soluble oligomers were incubated with purified C2-α-syn monomer, and the association of monomer with seeds was detected by FlAsH. As a control, we incubated purified C2-α-syn monomer with SEC fractions that were derived from C2-α-syn monomer incubated for 0 h. We observed a time-dependent increase in FlAsH fluorescence for reactions containing C2-α-syn oligomers plus C2-α-syn monomer (Fig. 3B). In control reactions containing C2-α-syn monomer and control SEC fractions, FlAsH signal did not change significantly over the 3-h incubation period, reflecting the low nucleation rate of purified monomer at the concentrations used in the assay. In the fibril formation experiments, we estimated an oligomer/fibril ratio of < 1% after incubation of purified C2-α-syn monomer for 72 h, indicating that kinetics favor conversion to fibrils. To further characterize seed extension by sequential association of monomer using fibrils as seeds, we used a water bath sonicator to fragment and disperse fibrils obtained after a 72-h incubation of C2-α-syn. Characterization of these seeds by dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicated consistent size distribution and concentration across independently generated batches (Table 1). Incubation of 30 μg/ml sonicated fibrils with 500 μg/ml C2-α-syn monomer in SeGMA assays produced a linear increase in FlAsH signal over 4.5 h. In control reactions with no added fibril seeds, FlAsH signal did not increase, reflecting the absence of spontaneous nucleation over the 4.5-h incubation period (Fig. 3C).Table 1Estimation of WT and mutant fibril seed sizeC2-α-syn fibril seedsZ-average (diameter ± S.D.)PDI (average ± S.D.)Independent measurements (n)nmWT57.0 ± 2.90.245 ± 0.0210A30P57.00.2632A53T72.20.2762E46K80.8 ± 7.00.187 ± 0.166G51D67.9 ± 6.00.244 ± 0.046H50Q53.5 ± 3.80.306 ± 0.046Fibril buffer8.9 ± 0.20.260 ± 0.0210 Open table in a new tab To compare the sensitivity of FlAsH and ThioT in SeGMA assays, we incubated different amounts of sonicated C2-α-syn fibril seeds with 500 μg/ml C2-α-syn monomer for 3 h and quantified seed extension with either FlAsH (Fig. 4A) or ThioT (Fig. 4B). We observed a linear increase for both FlAsH and ThioT fluorescence with respect to seed concentration. However, the signal/background ratio was substantially higher for FlAsH fluorescence compared with ThioT fluorescence for the lower levels of fibril formation in SeGMA assays. We calculated the Z′-factor as an estimate of the dynamic range and separation band for assays measuring seed extension by FlAsH and ThioT (Table 2). Assays with FlAsH produced a Z′-factor between 0.62 and 0.96 for all fibril seed concentrations tested in the SeGMA assay, indicating robust assay performance and suitability as a screening assay. Z′-Factors for ThioT assays were in the range of 0.00–0.26, indicating smaller separation bands and marginal assay performance. We used the same conditions, 11.5 μg/ml C2-α-syn fibril seeds, and 500 μg/ml C2-α-syn monomer to compare the signal/background ratio for FlAsH (Fig. 4C) and ThioT (Fig. 4D) over 96 h of fibril growth and also saw a higher signal/background ratio for FlAsH compared with ThioT during the longer incubation time. At 96 h, the signal/background ratio was 26.2 for FlAsH and 2.1 for ThioT. The advantage of FlAsH over ThioT was less pronounced for the measurement of fibril formation when α-syn monomer was incubated at higher concentrations with shaking (Fig. 1), where the amount of fibril formation was ∼20-fold higher, based on measurement of fibril concentration by a BCA sedimentation assay.Table 2Z′-factor analysis of FlAsH and ThioT performance in SeGMA assaysSeed concentrationFlAsH fluorescenceThioT fluorescence3 h0 hZ′-Factor3 h0 hZ′-Factorμg/mlafu ± S.D.afu ± S.D.afu ± S.D.afu ± S.D.0.003315 ± 593047.6 ± 12.28807 ± 6708362.5 ± 199.53.612,815 ± 4016742 ± 373.90.629933.3 ± 1319238.5 ± 76.50.107.224,278 ± 88.510,584 ± 1130.9611,147.6 ± 879660.5 ± 277.50.2614.548,310 ± 774.519,179.3 ± 8700.8313,807 ± 30910,607 ± 7550.00 Open table in a new tab To determine the effects of familial PD-associated α-syn mutations on the kinetics of fibril formation, we measured seed growth rates for C2-WT and mutant C2-α-syn seeds combined with corresponding C2-WT and mutant C2-α-syn monomer proteins (homologous SeGMA assay). We incubated 11.5 μg/ml seeds with 500 μg/ml C2-α-syn monomer for various lengths of time (0–5 h) and measured growth rates in the FlAsH assay (Fig. 5, A and B). All five missense amino acid mutations altered the rate of seed extension relative to WT. The A53T and H50Q mutations increased the rate of seed extension to 460 and 283% of the rate of WT, respectively. In contrast, the E46K, G51D and A30P mutations decreased the seed extension rate to 60, 42, and 30% of WT, respectively (Fig. 5C). Similar results were observed in multiple independent experiments.

This study aims to verify new biomarkers for AIP and propose a serological pattern to differentiate AIP from pancreatic adenocarcinoma with routinely performed tests. In this study, data of serum samples were collected and compared between 25 patients with AIP and 100 patients with pancreatic carcinoma. Receiver operating characteristic analysis and logistic regression was performed to evaluate the diagnostic effect of serum parameters in differentiating AIP from pancreatic carcinoma alone or in combination. Among several serum markers observed in the two groups, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (Ca19-9), globulin, eosinophils and hemoglobin were selected as the independent markers. Serum levels of Globulin, Eosinophil percentage in AIP group were significantly higher than in pancreatic cancer group (P<0.05), while hemoglobin and tumor marker CA19-9 levels were lower (P <0.05). The combination of these markers identified patients with AIP with 92% sensitivity and 79% specificity, which indicated relatively high diagnostic value. Elevated serum eosinophils, globulin, together with decreased hemoglobin level can be used as a preoperative indicator for AIP and can help to initiate diagnosis of AIP in time."
https://openalex.org/W2604384321,"Objective Underactive bladder is frequently encountered in elderly patients. It may result from detrusor underactivity (DU) or low detrusor contractility due to a urethral sphincter inhibitory effect. This study analyzed the video-urodynamic study (VUDS) characteristics of patients with underactive bladder in a large cohort of men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Methods Male patients with LUTS who had failed the initial treatment were consecutively enrolled. All patients underwent detailed urological investigations including prostate measurement, free uroflowmetry, post-void residual volume (PVR) measurement, cystoscopy and VUDS. The VUDS characteristics of the men with underactive bladder were analyzed and compared with those of men with bladder outlet obstruction and normal tracing. Results A total of 1329 men who underwent VUDS were included in this retrospective analysis. After VUDS, the final diagnosis was DU in 165 patients, poor relaxation of external sphincter (PRES) in 525, bladder outlet obstruction in 501, and normal tracing in 138. VUDS findings in DU patients showed a slowly increased detrusor pressure, intermittent detrusor contractions, or early decline of detrusor contraction, resulting in a low maximum flow rate (Qmax), and large PVR. In comparison with the PRES groups, DU patients were older, had reduced bladder sensation, lower detrusor pressure (Pdet), lower Qmax, larger PVR volume, and lower voiding efficiency. Patients with urodynamic PRES also had low-pressure–low-flow tracings, but their bladder sensation was similar to that with normal tracing. DU patients with very low Pdet also had low detrusor tonicity, and more medical co-morbidities than the other groups did. Conclusion Idiopathic underactive bladder in elderly men could be attributed to urodynamic DU and PRES. DU is associated with old age, reduced bladder sensation, low voiding efficiency, and medical co-morbidities."

In particular, to determine the degree of PCB contamination in the fish, we investigated the concentration of total PCB (∑PCB) and the proportions of 209 individual PCB congeners by high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. The ∑PCB concentration was 1.7–33 ng/g in fat greenling (n = 29), 0.44–25 ng/g in flounder (n = 36), and 1.6–86 ng/g in mackerel (n = 36), all values being much lower than the provisional regulatory limit in Japan. In the congener analysis, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and hepta-chlorinated PCB congeners dominated in all samples (comprising over 86% of the ∑PCB). The proportions of the chlorinated PCB congeners were similar to the contamination patterns derived from Kanechlor in the environment, implying that the marine fish were not contaminated with fresh PCBs."
https://openalex.org/W2605141932,"The androgen derivative androstadienone is a substance found in human sweat and thus is a putative human chemosignal. Androstadienone has been studied with respect to effects on mood states, attractiveness ratings, physiological and neural activation. With the current experiment, we aimed to explore in which way androstadienone affects attention to social cues (human faces). Moreover, we wanted to test whether effects depend on specific emotions, the participants' sex and individual sensitivity to smell androstadienone. To do so, we investigated 56 healthy individuals (thereof 29 females taking oral contraceptives) with two attention tasks on two consecutive days (once under androstadienone, once under placebo exposure in pseudorandomized order). With an emotional dot-probe task we measured visuo-spatial cueing while an emotional Stroop task allowed us to investigate interference control. Our results suggest that androstadienone acts in a sex, task and emotion-specific manner as a reduction in interference processes in the emotional Stroop task was only apparent for angry faces in men under androstadienone exposure. More specifically, men showed a smaller difference in reaction times for congruent compared to incongruent trials. At the same time also women were slightly affected by smelling androstadienone as they classified angry faces more often correctly under androstadienone. For the emotional dot-probe task no modulation by androstadienone was observed. Furthermore, in both attention paradigms individual sensitivity to androstadienone was neither correlated with reaction times nor error rates in men and women. To conclude, exposure to androstadienone seems to potentiate the relevance of angry faces in both men and women in connection with interference control, while processes of visuo-spatial cueing remain unaffected."

Nanoparticles can induce inflammatory responses, which may exacerbate the inflammation that occurs in the vaginal tracts of women with yeast infections. This study evaluated the effects of these drug-delivery nanoparticles on VK2(E6/E7) vaginal epithelial cell proinflammatory responses to Candida albicans yeast infections. Vaginal epithelial cell monolayers were infected with C. albicans and exposed to 100 μg/ml 49.5 nm PLGA-PEG nanospheres or 20 μg/ml 1.1 x 500 nm PEG-functionalized graphene oxide (GO-PEG) sheets. The cells were assessed for changes in mRNA and protein expression of inflammation-related genes by RT-qPCR and physiological markers of cell stress using high content analysis and flow cytometry. C. albicans exposure suppressed apoptotic gene expression, but induced oxidative stress in the cells. The nanomaterials induced cytotoxicity and programmed cell death responses alone and with C. albicans. PLGA-PEG nanoparticles induced mRNA expression of apoptosis-related genes and induced poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, increased BAX/BCL2 ratios, and chromatin condensation indicative of apoptosis. They also induced autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and DNA damage. They caused the cells to excrete inflammatory recruitment molecules chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), interleukin-1α (IL1A), interleukin-1β (IL1B), calprotectin (S100A8), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF). GO-PEG nanoparticles induced expression of necrosis-related genes and cytotoxicity. They reduced autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptotic gene expression responses. The results show that stealth nanoparticle drug-delivery vehicles may cause intracellular damage to vaginal epithelial cells by several mechanisms and that their use for intravaginal drug delivery may exacerbate inflammation in active yeast infections by increased inflammatory recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W2605172274,"The capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) is one of Poland's most endangered bird species, with an estimated population of 380-500 individuals in four isolated areas. To study these natural populations in Poland further, more than 900 non-invasive genetic samples were collected, along with samples from 59 birds representing large, continuous populations in Sweden and Russia; and from two centres in Poland breeding capercaillie. Microsatellite polymorphism at nine loci was then analysed to estimate within-population genetic diversity and genetic differentiation among populations. The results confirmed that isolation of populations and recent decreases in their sizes have reduced genetic diversity among capercaillie in Poland, with all the country's natural populations found to be experiencing the genetic after-effects of demographic bottlenecks. The results of analyses of genetic differentiation and structure further suggest the presence of a 'lowland' cluster (encompassing birds of the Augustowska and Solska Primaeval Forests in Poland, and of Sweden and Russia), and a Carpathian cluster. Capercaillie from Sweden and Russia are also found to differ markedly. The Polish lowland populations seem more closely related to birds from Scandinavia. Our genetic analysis also indicates that the stocks at breeding centres are of a high genetic diversity effectively reflecting the origins of founder individuals, though identification of ancestry requires further study in the case of some birds. Overall, the results sustain the conclusion that the Polish populations of capercaillie from the Carpathians and the lowlands should be treated as independent Management Units (MUs). This is to say that the breeding lines associated with these two sources should be maintained separately at breeding centres. The high level of genetic differentiation of birds from the Solska Primaeval Forest suggests that this population should also be assigned the status of independent MU."
https://openalex.org/W2605256318,"The mammalian lung develops through branching morphogenesis. Two primary forms of branching, which occur in order, in the lung have been identified: tip bifurcation and side branching. However, the mechanisms of lung branching morphogenesis remain to be explored. In our previous study, a biological mechanism was presented for lung branching pattern formation through a branching model. Here, we provide a mathematical mechanism underlying the branching patterns. By decoupling the branching model, we demonstrated the existence of Turing instability. We performed Turing instability analysis to reveal the mathematical mechanism of the branching patterns. Our simulation results show that the Turing patterns underlying the branching patterns are spot patterns that exhibit high local morphogen concentration. The high local morphogen concentration induces the growth of branching. Furthermore, we found that the sparse spot patterns underlie the tip bifurcation patterns, while the dense spot patterns underlies the side branching patterns. The dispersion relation analysis shows that the Turing wavelength affects the branching structure. As the wavelength decreases, the spot patterns change from sparse to dense, the rate of tip bifurcation decreases and side branching eventually occurs instead. In the process of transformation, there may exists hybrid branching that mixes tip bifurcation and side branching. Since experimental studies have reported that branching mode switching from side branching to tip bifurcation in the lung is under genetic control, our simulation results suggest that genes control the switch of the branching mode by regulating the Turing wavelength. Our results provide a novel insight into and understanding of the formation of branching patterns in the lung and other biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2604233388,"Increases in nuclear calcium concentration generate specific biological outcomes that differ from those resulting from increased cytoplasmic calcium. Nuclear calcium effects on tumor cell proliferation are widely appreciated; nevertheless, its involvement in other steps of tumor progression is not well understood. Therefore, we evaluated whether nuclear calcium is essential in other additional stages of tumor progression, including key steps associated with the formation of the primary tumor or with the metastatic cascade. We found that nuclear calcium buffering impaired 4T1 triple negative breast cancer growth not just by decreasing tumor cell proliferation, but also by enhancing tumor necrosis. Moreover, nuclear calcium regulates tumor angiogenesis through a mechanism that involves the upregulation of the anti-angiogenic C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10-IP10). In addition, nuclear calcium buffering regulates breast tumor cell motility, culminating in less cell invasion, likely due to enhanced vinculin expression, a focal adhesion structural protein. Together, our results show that nuclear calcium is essential for triple breast cancer angiogenesis and cell migration and can be considered as a promising strategic target for triple negative breast cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2604594062,"Background Right Atrial Volume Index (RAVI) measured by echocardiography is an independent predictor of morbidity in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The aim of this study is to evaluate the predictive value of RAVI assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) for all-cause mortality in patients with HFrEF and to assess its additive contribution to the validated Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic heart failure (MAGGIC) score. Methods and results We identified 243 patients (mean age 60 ± 15; 33% women) with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35% measured by CMR. Right atrial volume was calculated based on area in two- and four -chamber views using validated equation, followed by indexing to body surface area. MAGGIC score was calculated using online calculator. During mean period of 2.4 years 33 patients (14%) died. The mean RAVI was 53 ± 26 ml/m2; significantly larger in patients with than without an event (78.7±29 ml/m2 vs. 48±22 ml/m2, p<0.001). RAVI (per ml/m2) was an independent predictor of mortality [HR = 1.03 (1.01–1.04), p = 0.001]. RAVI has a greater discriminatory ability than LVEF, left atrial volume index and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) (C-statistic 0.8±0.08 vs 0.55±0.1, 0.62±0.11, 0.68±0.11, respectively, all p<0.02). The addition of RAVI to the MAGGIC score significantly improves risk stratification (integrated discrimination improvement 13%, and category-free net reclassification improvement 73%, both p<0.001). Conclusion RAVI by CMR is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with HFrEF. The addition of RAVI to MAGGIC score improves mortality risk stratification."

This paper analyses the issue by considering the Italian rates of unemployment amongst individuals with and without mental health problems in 2005 and 2013, that is prior and during the economic crisis. Methods We used data from the National surveys on “Health conditions and use of health services” carried out by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) for the years 2005 and 2013. The surveys collected information on the health status and socioeconomic conditions of the Italian population. Self-reported unemployment status was analysed amongst individuals with and without reported mental health problems. In addition, descriptive statistics were performed in order to detect possible differences in the risk of unemployment within different regional contexts characterised by different socio-economic conditions. Results The recession determined increased disparities in unemployment rates between people with and without mental health problems. Regardless to the presence of mental health problems, young people were more likely to be unemployed. Among people who reported mental health problems, males were more likely to be unemployed than females. People with low education level were more likely to be unemployed, particularly during the recession and in presence of mental health problems. Changes in unemployment rates due to the crisis showed different patterns across different regions of the Country. Conclusions These analyses confirm that in periods of economic crisis people with mental health problems are at risk of experiencing exclusion from labour market. In addition, the impact is even worse within the group with low education and younger age. These findings emphasise the importance of specific interventions aimed at promoting labour market participation and reintegration for people with mental health problems."
https://openalex.org/W2604305465,"Previously, Planted Fixed-Bed Reactors (PFRs) have been used to investigate microbial toluene removal in the rhizosphere of constructed wetlands. Aerobic toluene degradation was predominant in these model systems although bulk redox conditions were hypoxic to anoxic. However, culture-independent approaches indicated also that microbes capable of anaerobic toluene degradation were abundant. Therefore, we aimed at isolating anaerobic-toluene degraders from one of these PFRs. From the obtained colonies which consisted of spirilli-shaped bacteria, a strain designated 15–1 was selected for further investigations. Analysis of its 16S rRNA gene revealed greatest similarity (99%) with toluene-degrading Magnetospirillum sp. TS-6. Isolate 15–1 grew with up to 0.5 mM of toluene under nitrate-reducing conditions. Cells reacted to higher concentrations of toluene by an increase in the degree of saturation of their membrane fatty acids. Strain 15–1 contained key genes for the anaerobic degradation of toluene via benzylsuccinate and subsequently the benzoyl-CoA pathway, namely bssA, encoding for the alpha subunit of benzylsuccinate synthase, bcrC for subunit C of benzoyl-CoA reductase and bamA for 6-oxocyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA hydrolase. Finally, most members of a clone library of bssA generated from the PFR had highest similarity to bssA from strain 15–1.

In this study, we selected South Chinese brown frogs as a model to examine the phylogenetic and biogeographical consequences of Miocene tectonic events within South China and its margins. We used mitochondrial and nuclear molecular data to reconstruct phylogenetic interrelationships among Chinese brown frogs using Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses. The phylogeny results show that there are four main clades of Chinese brown frogs. Excepting the three commonly known Chinese brown frog species groups, R. maoershanensis forms an independent clade nearest to the R. japonica group. Phylogeny and P-distance analyses confirmed R. maoershanensis as a valid species. Among South Chinese brown frogs, there are four subclades associated with four geographical areas: (I) R. maoershanensis; (II) R. japonica; (III) R. chaochiaoensis; and (IV) other species of the R. longicrus species group. Divergence times, estimated using mitochondrial sequences, place the vicariance events among the four subclades in the middle to late Miocene epoch. Our results suggest that (1) South Chinese brown frogs originated due to a vicariance event separating them from the R. chensinensis species group at the time of the Geological movement (~18 million years ago, Ma) in southern Tibet and the Himalayan region; (2) the separation and speciation of R. maoershanensis from the R. japonica group occurred due to the dry climate at approximately 16 Ma; (3) South Chinese brown frogs migrated from South China to Japan at the time (~10.8 Ma) that the global sea-level fell and the East China Sea Shelf Basin was swamp facies, when a land gallery may have formed across the sea to connect the two areas; and (4) R. chaochiaoensis separated from other species of the R. longicrus species group during the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau at approximately 9.5 Ma."

Active sensing might function in vision, olfaction, and gustation, whereas passive sensing might function in vision and olfaction but not gustation. To investigate whether each sensory property affected synchrony perception, participants in this study performed simultaneity judgment (SJ) for three cross-modal combinations using visual (red LED light), olfactory (coumarin), and gustatory (NaCl solution) stimuli. We calculated the half-width at half-height (HWHH) and point of subjective simultaneity (PSS) on the basis of temporal distributions of simultaneous response rates in each combination. Although HWHH did not differ significantly among three cross-modal combinations, HWHH exhibited a higher value in cross-modal combinations involving one or two chemical stimuli than in combinations of two physical stimuli, reported in a previous study. The PSS of the olfactory–visual combination was approximately equal to the point of objective simultaneity (POS), whereas the PSS of visual–gustatory, and olfactory–gustatory combinations receded significantly from the POS. In order to generalize these results as specific to chemical senses in regard to synchrony perception, we need to determine whether the same phenomena will be reproduced when performing SJ for various cross-modal combinations using visual, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli other than red LED light, coumarin, and NaCl solution."
https://openalex.org/W2605169033,"The aim of the study was to develop a novel risk estimation model for predicting silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and no clinical cardiovascular disease, evaluating the potential role of insulin resistance in such a model. Additionally, the accuracy of this model was compared with currently available models for predicting clinical coronary artery disease (CAD) in general and diabetic populations.Patients with T1DM (35-65years, >10-year duration) and no clinical cardiovascular disease were consecutively evaluated for: 1) clinical and anthropometric data (including classical cardiovascular risk factors), 2) insulin sensitivity (estimate of glucose disposal rate (eGDR)), and 3) SMI diagnosed by stress myocardial perfusion gated SPECTs.Eighty-four T1DM patients were evaluated [50.1±9.3 years, 50% men, 36.9% active smokers, T1DM duration: 19.0(15.9-27.5) years and eGDR 7.8(5.5-9.4)mg·kg-1·min-1]. Of these, ten were diagnosed with SMI (11.9%). Multivariate logistic regression models showed that only eGDR (OR = -0.593, p = 0.005) and active smoking (OR = 7.964, p = 0.018) were independently associated with SMI. The AUC of the ROC curve of this risk estimation model for predicting SMI was 0.833 (95%CI:0.692-0.974), higher than those obtained with the use of currently available models for predicting clinical CAD (Framingham Risk Equation: 0.833 vs. 0.688, p = 0.122; UKPDS Risk Engine (0.833 vs. 0.559; p = 0.001) and EDC equation: 0.833 vs. 0.558, p = 0.027).This study provides the first ever reported risk-estimation model for predicting SMI in T1DM. The model only includes insulin resistance and active smoking as main predictors of SMI."
https://openalex.org/W2605206813,"The lifetime risk of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) development differs among ethnic groups. To better understand these differences, this prospective cohort study was conducted to investigate the cytokine profile and the HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) in Japanese and non-Japanese populations with HAM/TSP and asymptomatic carriers (ACs). The serum IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α, and IFN-γ levels were quantified using the Cytometric Bead Array in 40 HTLV-1-infected patients (11 HAM/TSP and 29 ACs) and 18 healthy controls (HCs) in Brazil. Among ACs, 15 were Japanese descendants and 14 were non-Japanese. Of 11 patients with HAM/TSP, only one was a Japanese descendant. The HTLV-1 PVL was quantified by real-time PCR. The HTLV-1 PVL was 2.7-fold higher in HAM/TSP patients than ACs. Regardless of the clinical outcome, the PVL was significantly higher in patients younger than 60 years than older patients. The HAM/TSP and ACs had higher IL-10 serum concentrations than that of HCs. The ACs also showed higher IL-6 serum levels than those of HCs. According to age, the IL-10 and IL-6 levels were higher in ACs non-Japanese patients older than 60 years. HAM/TSP patients showed a positive correlation between IL-6 and IL-17 and a negative correlation between the PVL and IL-17 and IFN-γ. In the all ACs, a significant positive correlation was observed between IL-2 and IL-17 and a negative correlation was detected between IL-10 and TNF-α. Only 6.25% of the Japanese patients were symptomatic carriers, compared with 41.67% of the non-Japanese patients. In conclusion, this study showed that high levels of HTLV-1 PVL was intrinsicaly associated with the development of HAM/TSP. A higher HTLV-1 PVL and IL10 levels found in non-Japanese ACs over 60 years old, which compared with the Japanese group depicts that the ethnic background may interfere in the host immune status. More researches also need to be undertaken regarding the host genetic background to better understand the low frequency of HAM/TSP in Japanese HTLV-1-infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2605365671,"The properties and function of large-conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channels are modified by the tissue-specific expression of regulatory β1-subunits. Although the short cytosolic N-terminal domain of the β1-subunit is important for controlling both BK channel trafficking and function, whether the same, or different, regions of the N terminus control these distinct processes remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that the first six N-terminal residues including Lys-3, Lys-4, and Leu-5 are critical for controlling functional regulation, but not trafficking, of BK channels. This membrane-distal region has features of an amphipathic helix that is predicted to control the orientation of the first transmembrane-spanning domain (TM1) of the β1-subunit. In contrast, a membrane-proximal leucine residue (Leu-17) controls trafficking without affecting functional coupling, an effect that is in part dependent on controlling efficient endoplasmic reticulum exit of the pore-forming α-subunit. Thus cell surface trafficking and functional coupling with BK channels are controlled by distinct domains of the β1-subunit N terminus.

https://openalex.org/W2604332166,"For the first time, this study has systemically investigated the male reproductive system in a sessile broadcast-spawning marine invertebrate, Galeolaria caespitosa (Polychaeta: Serpulidae), which has significant potential as a bio-indicator species of coastal marine pollution. The abdomen of G. caespitosa was divided by intersegmental septa into over 80 trunk segments. Each segment served as a germinal chamber with a C-shaped gonadal arrangement consisting of several distinct compartments: a seminiferous epithelium (SE) compartment located in the centre of the chamber, with each of its two ends connecting to a nurse cell (NC) compartment and then an efferent duct (ED) compartment. The SE compartment contained a multilayered seminiferous epithelium where spermatogenesis was initiated. Spermatids were released in pairs into the lumen of the SE compartment and then transported to the NC compartment where they underwent spermiogenesis with the support of secretory vesicles released by the nurse cells. Spermatozoa were stored in the ED compartment and subsequently released into the seawater through the vas deferens. Unlike vertebrates where germ cells differentiated in close proximity to the nurse cell population (i.e. Sertoli cells), the spermatogenic cells of G. caespitosa exhibited no direct contact with supporting cells at any spermatogenic stage. This finding suggested that the spermatogenesis in G. caespitosa was more dependent on intrinsic developmental programming than most species. Notwithstanding such differences, there were clear parallels between the male reproductive system of G. caespitosa and mammals, in terms of the structure and function. The independence of spermatogenic cells from supporting cells in G. caespitosa raised the possibility of inducing spermiogenesis in vitro, which would provide a useful tool to dissect the mechanisms underlying this complex cell differentiation process in invertebrates and other higher order animals."
https://openalex.org/W2604118729,"Purpose To present the rates of referral of participants in the National Eye Health Survey (NEHS) for further eye care. Materials & methods A national sample of 3098 non-Indigenous Australians aged 50–98 and 1738 Indigenous Australians aged 40–92 years living in 30 randomly selected sites was recruited using a door-to-door approach. Participants completed a general questionnaire and a series of eye tests, including vision and anterior segment assessment, intra-ocular pressure measurement, visual field testing and fundus photography. A predefined protocol was used to guide the referral of participants for follow up eye care. An ophthalmologist was on-call to assist with the triaging of participants. Results Of the total sample, 32.1% (994/3098) of non-Indigenous participants and 43.6% (757/1738) of Indigenous participants were referred for further eye care (p<0.001). A significant difference in referral rates for Indigenous Australians was observed between regions of differing geographic remoteness [range = 32.2% (Inner Regional)—60.4% (Very Remote), p <0.001]. After adjusting for covariates, males (OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.06–1.46), older age (OR = 1.02 per year, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.02) and longer time since previous eye examination (OR = 1.15 per year, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.19) were associated with higher rates of eye care referral in the non-Indigenous population. In the Indigenous population, older age (OR = 1.02 per year, 95% CI: 1.01–1.03), self-reported diabetes (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.37–2.12), greater geographical remoteness (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.09–1.29) and longer time since previous eye examination (OR = 1.10 per year, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.13) were associated with a higher rate of referral after multivariate adjustments. A total of 25 participants (1.4%) were referred for urgent follow-up of potentially sight threatening conditions. Conclusions Our data has identified several high risk groups that required ophthalmic referral including older Australians, non-Indigenous men, Indigenous Australians with self-reported diabetes and those residing in very remote populations who may benefit from improvements in the provision and/or uptake of eye health services. Future longitudinal research is warranted to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of implementing a referral protocol within a population-based research setting."
https://openalex.org/W2605124976,"Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase with a fundamental role in B-lymphocyte development and activation. The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of BTK is specifically modulated by the Ankyrin Repeat Domain 54 (ANKRD54) protein and the interaction is known to be exclusively SH3-dependent. To identify the spectrum of the ANKRD54 SH3-interactome, we applied phage-display screening of a library containing all the 296 human SH3 domains. The BTK-SH3 domain was the prime interactor. Quantitative western blotting analysis demonstrated the accuracy of the screening procedure. Revealing the spectrum and specificity of ANKRD54-interactome is a critical step toward functional analysis in cells and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2605376395,"While working with G418-resistant stably transfected cells, we realized the neomycin resistance (NeoR) gene, which encodes the aminoglycoside-3'-phosphotransferase-IIa [APH(3')-IIa], also confers resistance to the nucleoside analog fludarabine. Fludarabine is a cytostatic drug widely used in the treatment of hematologic and solid tumors, as well as in the conditioning of patients before transplantation of hematopoietic progenitors. We present evidence that NeoR-transfected cells do not incorporate fludarabine, thus avoiding DNA damage caused by the drug, evidenced by a lack of FANCD2 monoubiquitination and impaired apoptosis. A screening of other nucleoside analogs revealed that APH(3')-IIa only protects against ATP purine analogs. Moreover, APH(3')-IIa ATPase activity is inhibited by fludarabine monophosphate, suggesting that APH(3')-IIa blocks fludarabine incorporation into DNA by dephosphorylating its active fludarabine triphosphate form. Furthermore, overexpression of the catalytic subunit of the eukaryotic kinase PKA, which is structurally related to APHs, also provides resistance to fludarabine, anticipating its putative utility as a response marker to the drug. Our results preclude the use of Neo marker plasmids in the study of purine analogs and unveils a new resistance mechanism against these chemotherapeuticals.-Sánchez-Carrera, D., Bravo-Navas, S., Cabezón, E., Arechaga, I., Cabezas, M., Yáñez, L., Pipaón, C.
