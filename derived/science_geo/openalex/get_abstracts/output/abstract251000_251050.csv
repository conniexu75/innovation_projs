https://openalex.org/W2140254135,"Recent advances have highlighted extensive phenotypic and functional similarities between normal stem cells and cancer stem cells. This raises the question of whether disease therapies can be developed that eliminate cancer stem cells without eliminating normal stem cells. Here we address this issue by conditionally deleting the Pten tumour suppressor gene in adult haematopoietic cells. This led to myeloproliferative disease within days and transplantable leukaemias within weeks. Pten deletion also promoted haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation. However, this led to HSC depletion via a cell-autonomous mechanism, preventing these cells from stably reconstituting irradiated mice. In contrast to leukaemia-initiating cells, HSCs were therefore unable to maintain themselves without Pten. These effects were mostly mediated by mTOR as they were inhibited by rapamycin. Rapamycin not only depleted leukaemia-initiating cells but also restored normal HSC function. Mechanistic differences between normal stem cells and cancer stem cells can thus be targeted to deplete cancer stem cells without damaging normal stem cells."

FGFs bind and activate alternatively spliced forms of four tyrosine kinase FGF receptors (FGFRs 1–4). The spatial and temporal expression patterns of FGFs and FGFRs and the ability of specific ligand-receptor pairs to actively signal are important factors regulating FGF activity in a variety of biological processes. FGF signaling activity is regulated by the binding specificity of ligands and receptors and is modulated by extrinsic cofactors such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In previous studies, we have engineered BaF3 cell lines to express the seven principal FGFRs and used these cell lines to determine the receptor binding specificity of FGFs 1–9 by using relative mitogenic activity as the readout. Here we have extended these semiquantitative studies to assess the receptor binding specificity of the remaining FGFs 10–23. This study completes the mitogenesis-based comparison of receptor specificity of the entire FGF family under standard conditions and should help in interpreting and predicting in vivo biological activity.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) 2The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor; HS, heparan sulfate; BHK, baby hamster kidney; FHF, FGF homologous factor. comprise a structurally related family of 22 molecules. FGFs can be grouped into seven subfamilies based on their sequence similarities and functional properties (1Itoh N. Ornitz D.M.

FGFs bind four high affinity, ligand-dependent FGF receptor tyrosine kinase molecules (FGFR1–4). In the presence of heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycans, FGFs stably bind FGFRs and lead to the formation of 2:2:2 FGF-FGFR-HS dimers, which enables the cytoplasmic kinase domains to transphosphorylate one another and become activated (4Mohammadi M. Olsen S.K. Ibrahimi O.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 107-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). FGFR activation results in the stimulation of various signal transduction cascades that have been implicated in multiple aspects of vertebrate and invertebrate embryonic development, tumor growth, angiogenesis, wound healing, and physiology (2Ornitz D.M.

Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 165-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each FGFR contains an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular ligand binding domain of the FGFR contains two or three Ig-like domains (8Lee P.L. Johnson D.E. Cousens L.S. Fried V.A. Williams L.T.

Alternative RNA splicing that utilizes one of two unique exons results in two different versions of Ig-like domain III (referred to as domains IIIb and IIIc) in FGFRs 1–3. This alternative splicing is an essential determinant of ligand binding specificity (10Chellaiah A.T. McEwen D.G. Werner S. Xu J. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol.

The IIIb (“b”) and IIIc (“c”) splice forms are regulated in a tissue-specific manner, such that the b isoform is restricted to epithelial lineages and the c isoform is preferentially expressed in mesenchymal lineages (15Alarid E.T.

The structural basis by which this major alternative splicing in Ig-like domain III of FGFR2 modulates FGF binding specificity has been elucidated (14Yeh B.K. Igarashi M. Eliseenkova A.V.

In addition to tissue-specific FGF and FGFR expression, FGFR activation is modulated by heparin, heparan sulfate, or other glycosaminoglycan chains (19Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M.

It has been recently postulated that the HS selectivity in FGF signaling is attained in the context of a 2:2 FGF-FGFR dimer and not by FGF, FGFR, or even 1:1 FGF-FGFR pairs (28Mohammadi M. Olsen S.K. Goetz R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of FGF-FGFR binding specificities is critical to understanding the biological mechanisms involved in normal development and pathogenesis. Here we extend our previous study (12Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol.

Materials—Human recombinant FGF1, FGF7, FGF8, FGF9, FGF10, FGF16, FGF17, FGF18, and FGF20 were from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Recombinant human FGF12, FGF14, FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (29Yu X. Ibrahimi O.A. Goetz R. Zhang F. Davis S.I. Garringer H.J.

The source of FGFR cDNAs, FGFR expression plasmids, and FGFR-expressing BaF3 cell lines were described previously (12Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G.

BaF3 Cell Culture and Mitogenic Assay—BaF3 cells expressing specific FGFRs were described previously (12Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% newborn bovine serum (Sigma), 0.5 ng/ml murine-recombinant interleukin-3 (PeproTech Inc.), 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, 50 nm β-mercaptoethanol (BaF3 culture medium), and G418 (600 μg/ml). For mitogenic assays, FGFR-expressing BaF3 cells were plated at a density of 30,000 cells/well in a 96-well assay plate in BaF3 assay medium containing varying concentrations of FGF and heparin. FGFs diluted in assay medium were added to each well for a total volume of 200 μl/well. The cells were then incubated for 36–48 h. Mitogenic activity was determined by adding 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine in 50 μl of BaF3 assay medium to each well. The cells were harvested after 4–6 h by filtration through glass fiber paper. The incorporated [3H]thymidine was counted on a Wallac β plate scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Preparation of FGF22-conditioned Medium—A cDNA encoding the full-length mouse FGF22 protein was isolated from mouse brain mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR (forward primer, 5′-AATTGCTAGCATGCGCAGCCGCCTCTGGCTG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGGCCTCGAGAGACGAGACCAAGACTGGCAG-3′) (32Umemori H. Linhoff M.W. Ornitz D.M. Sanes J.R. Cell. 2004; 118: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The PCR product (∼500 bp) was inserted into the NheI-XhoI sites of the APtag5 vector (GenHunter Inc.), replacing both the signal sequence and the alkaline phosphatase sequence. APtag5-mFGF22 or the APtag5 empty vector was transfected into baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells (cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin). The cells were replated at 80–90% confluence into 90-mm dishes the day before transfection and then were transfected with 24 μg of plasmid and 60 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) medium according to the manufacturer's directions. After 48 h, the cells were split 1:20 into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Isolated colonies were picked after 10–14 days and propagated in the same medium. Reverse transcription-PCR (forward primer, 5′-GCTTCTATGTGGCCATGAATCGCA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGACCAAGACTGGCAGGAAGTGT-3′) was used to identify stable clonal cell lines expressing high levels of Aptag5-FGF22 (see Fig. 1A). Subconfluent stably transfected cell lines, grown in selection medium, were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to grow in BaF3 assay medium containing 2 μg/ml heparin for 48–72 h. Conditioned medium from control APtag-5 cells and Aptag5-FGF22 cells was collected, centrifuged to remove debris, and used for subsequent BaF3 assays. Data Analysis—FGF1 was used as a positive control to normalize the mitogenic activity of the other FGFs. To reduce sampling error in the comparison of the relative mitogenic activity, the mitogenic activity for each ligand was averaged at two different concentrations (312 and 1250 pm) (see Table 1) and normalized to the activity of FGF1 at these concentrations, or in the case of FGF19, -21, -23 to 5 nm FGF1.TABLE 1Relative mitogenic activity of FGF subfamiliesFGF receptorRelative mitogenic activity ± S.D.FGF-1FGF7 subfamilyFGF8 subfamilyFGF9 subfamilyFGF19 subfamily (×103)FGF7FGF10FGF22FGF8FGF17FGF18FGF9FGF16FGF20FGF19FGF21FGF231c100 ± 514.2 ± 4.112.5 ± 2.510.2 ± 1.757.5 ± 3.222.7 ± 0.34.7 ± 0.412.5 ± 1.44.3 ± 0.328.1 ± 4.0123 ± 5.734 ± 3.023 ± 2.72c100 ± 310.4 ± 4.06.1 ± 1.77.1 ± 1.191.6 ± 8.927.1 ± 9.528.9 ± 4.757.2 ± 5.432.5 ± 3.568.4 ± 2.8238 ± 11.586 ± 4.789 ± 10.53c100 ± 63.3 ± 1.40.8 ± 0.91.0 ± 0.5209 ± 6111 ± 577.7 ± 3.490.4 ± 6.032.4 ± 6.889.5 ± 7.3140 ± 11.123 ± 02.343 ± 5.51b100 ± 48.0 ± 1.539.4 ± 1.340.3 ± 1.65.3 ± 0.46.0 ± 2.26.3 ± 1.17.3 ± 1.06.5 ± 1.17.3 ± 0.912 ± 0.519 ± 3.411 ± 2.42b100 ± 5168 ± 6217 ± 1232 ± 35.9 ± 1.46.3 ± 0.67.8 ± 1.82.9 ± 0.41.8 ± 0.512.3 ± 0.761 ± 6.983 ± 5.466 ± 2.73b100 ± 46.7 ± 1.86.0 ± 0.55.3 ± 0.718.6 ± 6.310.7 ± 2.712.5 ± 2.042.7 ± 2.913 ± 2.644.3 ± 1.520 ± 1.726 ± 1.521 ± 0.84Δ100 ± 417.8 ± 0.511.5 ± 0.512.5 ± 0.9102 ± 0.485.5 ± 1.152.8 ± 1.710.1 ± 0.19.9 ± 0.326.6 ± 0.9410 ± 27.7128 ± 9.6222 ± 11.9 Open table in a new tab Receptor Binding Specificity of FGF Subfamilies—The murine pro-B cell line, BaF3, is an interleukin-3-dependent cell line that is commonly used for the analyses of receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Wild-type BaF3 cells do not express FGFRs, and BaF3 cells transfected with FGFRs proliferate in the absence of interleukin-3 when stimulated with FGF and heparin (19Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor binding specificity for FGFs 1–9 has been previously described (12Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). To directly compare the activity of FGF subfamilies containing newly described members, all seven FGFR-expressing BaF3 cell lines were assayed with each FGF at concentrations ranging from 20 to 5000 pm (FGFs 1, 7–10, 16–18, and 20) and from 3 to 800 nm (FGFs 19, 21, and 23). FGFs 7, 10, and 22 are more closely related to each other by sequence than to any other FGF and were predicted to have similar activity toward FGFRs. We and others have failed to produce active recombinant FGF22 protein. We therefore developed a cell line that secretes FGF22 into the culture medium (Fig. 1A). Dilutions of conditioned medium were assayed on FGFR2b-BaF3 cells. The concentration of the FGF22-conditioned medium was estimated to be equivalent to an FGF10 concentration of 300–600 pm. Control-conditioned medium showed no activity toward any of the BaF3 cell lines. FGFs 7, 10, and 22 all strongly activated FGFR2b. FGFs 10 and 22 showed weak activity toward FGFR1b, and all three of these FGFs failed to activate any of the other FGFR-expressing cell lines (Fig. 1, B and C; Fig. 5; and Table 1). The FGFs 8, 17, and 18 subfamily members showed similar activities to each other as those previously described (33Xu J.S. Liu Z.H. Ornitz D.M.

FGF8 subfamily members showed higher relative activity on FGFR3c cells and less activity toward FGFR1c. No activity was observed on the FGFRb isoform-expressing cell lines (Figs. 2 and 5 and Table 1). The FGFs 9, 16, and 20 subfamily members showed a similar profile to that of FGF9 (12Ornitz D.M. Xu J.

These FGFs activated FGFRc isoforms and FGFR4 with high activity, and unlike other FGFs that preferentially activate c splice form receptors, these FGFs consistently showed activity toward FGFR3b-expressing cells. FGF20 showed slight activity on FGFR2b cells and no activity on FGFR1b cells. FGFs 9 and 16 showed no activity toward FGFR1b or -2b (Figs. 3 and 5 and Table 1). The FGF19 (mouse FGF15), FGF21, and FGF23 subfamily is unique in that these FGFs can behave as secreted hormones (36Inagaki T. Choi M. Moschetta A. Peng L. Cummins C.L. McDonald J.G. Luo G.

To obtain significant activity of these FGFs on FGFR-expressing BaF3 cells required a protein concentration ranging from 3 to 800 nm and a heparin concentration >10 μg/ml (Fig. 4A). These parameters indicated low relative activity compared with other classic members of the FGF family. However, at these concentrations, FGFs 19, 21, and 23 showed consistent activity toward FGFR1c, 2c, 3c, and FGFR4 but no activity toward FGFR1b, 2b, or 3b (Fig. 4, C and D; Fig. 5; and Table 1).

Cancer Res. 2004; 91: 69-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Unregulated expression of FGFs can cause cancer (41Ezzat S. Asa S.L. Horm. Metab.

The expression patterns of FGF receptors 1, 2, and 3 are distinct but overlap in some tissues. Analysis of the alternative splicing pattern of these receptors demonstrates that the utilization of either the b or c exon is dependent upon cell lineage. The b isoform is preferentially expressed in epithelial tissues, whereas the c isoform is expressed in mesenchymal tissues (17Orr-Urtreger A. Bedford M.T. Burakova T. Arman E. Zimmer Y. Yayon A.

For example, the FGF7 subfamily is expressed in mesenchyme and shows the greatest activity toward FGFR2b. The FGF8 subfamily is expressed in epithelial tissues and activates c splice forms of FGFRs. Binding specificity between FGF and FGFRs is thus critical for the spatial regulation of FGF signaling. The specificity of the FGF7 subfamily, demonstrated in vitro in the BaF3 cell assay (Fig. 5), closely reflects the in vivo function of FGF10, a molecule expressed in mesenchymal tissue that signals to epithelial FGFR2b. Disruption of FGF10 signaling is catastrophic to embryonic development, resulting in severe defects in limb development and in organs requiring branching morphogenesis, such as the pancreas, salivary glands, and lungs (54Miralles F.

The interaction between FGF10 and FGFR2b is also required for embryonic palate and cecum development (61Burns R.C. Fairbanks T.J. Sala F. De Langhe S. Mailleux A. Thiery J.P. Dickson C. Itoh N.

The molecular etiology of Apert syndrome stems from inappropriate activation of mesenchymal FGFR2c by FGF7 family members (31Ibrahimi O.A. Zhang F. Eliseenkova A.V. Itoh N. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M.

A. 2001; 98: 7182-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of FGF10 in complex with FGFR2b has revealed that specific contacts between residues from the alternatively spliced βC′–βE loop region of FGFR2b and residues in the β4 strand and N terminus of FGF10 account for the FGF10-FGFR2b binding specificity (14Yeh B.K. Igarashi M. Eliseenkova A.V. Plotnikov A.N. Sher I. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Mohammadi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2266-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In particular, two highly specific hydrogen bonds involving Asp-76 in the N terminus of FGF10 and Ser-315 in the βC′–βE loop of FGFR2b are essential for FGF10-FGFR2b specificity. The involvement of these hydrogen bonds in conferring specificity between the FGF7 subfamily and FGFR2b is further supported by the fact that Asp-76 is unique to the FGF7 subfamily and Ser-315 is located in the b splice isoform-specific βC′–βE loop (14Yeh B.K. Igarashi M. Eliseenkova A.V. Plotnikov A.N. Sher I. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Mohammadi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2266-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). FGF8 subfamily members exclusively bind FGFRc splice forms and FGFR4 (Fig. 5). The recent crystal structure of FGF8b in complex with FGFR2c has provided the molecular basis by which FGF8 subfamily members attain their specificity/promiscuity toward c splice isoforms of FGFRs 1–3 and FGFR4 (70Olsen S.K. Li J.Y. Bromleigh C. Eliseenkova A.V. Ibrahimi O.A. Lao Z. Zhang F. Linhardt R.J. Joyner A.L. Mohammadi M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Importantly, in the case of the FGF8 subfamily, the alternatively spliced βF and βG strands, and not the βC′–βE loop, harbor the primary receptor determinants of FGF8 subfamily binding specificity. This is because the spatial positioning of the N terminus of FGF8 subfamily members, relative to the β-trefoil core, is opposite to that of other FGFs (70Olsen S.K. Li J.Y. Bromleigh C.

FGFs 8, 17, and 18 have distinct and overlapping expression patterns in several tissues, such as the developing mid-hindbrain junction (71Maruoka Y. Ohbayashi N. Hoshikawa M. Itoh N. Hogan B.M.

https://openalex.org/W2155722642,"Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is the predominant lipase effector of catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes. HSL-dependent lipolysis in response to catecholamines is mediated by protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of perilipin A (Peri A), an essential lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein. It is believed that perilipin phosphorylation is essential for the translocation of HSL from the cytosol to the LD, a key event in stimulated lipolysis. Using adipocytes retrovirally engineered from murine embryonic fibroblasts of perilipin null mice (Peri–/– MEF), we demonstrate by cell fractionation and confocal microscopy that up to 50% of cellular HSL is LD-associated in the basal state and that PKA-stimulated HSL translocation is fully supported by adenoviral expression of a mutant perilipin lacking all six PKA sites (Peri AΔ1–6). PKA-stimulated HSL translocation was confirmed in differentiated brown adipocytes from perilipin null mice expressing an adipose-specific Peri AΔ1–6 transgene. Thus, PKA-induced HSL translocation was independent of perilipin phosphorylation. However, Peri AΔ1–6 failed to enhance PKA-stimulated lipolysis in either MEF adipocytes or differentiated brown adipocytes. Thus, the lipolytic action(s) of HSL at the LD surface requires PKA-dependent perilipin phosphorylation. In Peri–/– MEF adipocytes, PKA activation significantly enhanced the amount of HSL that could be cross-linked to and co-immunoprecipitated with ectopic Peri A. Notably, this enhanced cross-linking was blunted in Peri–/– MEF adipocytes expressing Peri AΔ1–6. This suggests that PKA-dependent perilipin phosphorylation facilitates (either direct or indirect) perilipin interaction with LD-associated HSL. These results redefine and expand our understanding of how perilipin regulates HSL-mediated lipolysis in adipocytes.

In white adipose tissue, catecholamine-induced lipolysis provides fatty acids as fuel to peripheral tissues during times of energy need, such as fasting and exercise (3Coppack S.W.

In BAT of human newborns and rodents, catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis provides fatty acids for heat production (via β-oxidation and mitochondrial uncoupling) in response to hypothermia (i.e. adaptive thermogenesis) (2Robidoux J.

Thus, in addition to its role in whole body energy homeostasis, the regulation of adipocyte lipolysis is vital to metabolic health. Catecholamines stimulate lipolysis by binding to β-adrenergic receptors on adipocytes, resulting in up-regulation of adenyl cyclase and activation of PKA (11Belfrage P. Fredrikson G. Olsson H. Stralfors P. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1982; 102: 213-223PubMed Google Scholar). PKA activity is thought to increase lipolysis simultaneously by phosphorylating two key substrates, 1) the LD-associated protein, Peri A (12Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 2) HSL, the major lipase in adipocytes with significant hydrolytic action against triacylglyceride (TAG) and diacylglyceride (13Fredrikson G.

HSL phosphorylation by PKA increases HSL catalytic activity, although this increase (2–3-fold) cannot account for the up to a 100-fold increase in adipocyte lipolysis observed after PKA stimulation by catecholamines (15Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 16Egan J. Greenberg A. Chang M.-K. Wek S. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

More importantly, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of HSL also promotes HSL translocation from the cytosol to the LD, and the resulting interaction between catalytically active HSL and neutral lipid stores at the LD surface is thought to account for the preponderance of catecholamine-stimulated (versus basal) lipolysis (16Egan J.

Peri A (the predominant perilipin isoform in adipocytes) is the most prevalent PKA substrate in adipocytes and is a key regulator of both basal and PKA-stimulated lipolysis. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that reduced levels or absence of perilipin A results in increased basal lipolysis while substantially attenuating catecholamine (PKA)-stimulated lipolysis (20Tansey J.

The ability of perilipin to function as both a repressor of basal lipolysis and an enhancer of PKA-stimulated lipolysis has been incorporated into a “barrier”/translocation model of perilipin function wherein the following occur. 1) In the absence of PKA-dependent phosphorylation, perilipin functions as a barrier between stored neutral lipid and lipases such as HSL, thereby maintaining a low rate of basal lipolysis (22Souza S.

The present study provides the first empirical dissection of the coincident effects of blocking perilipin phosphorylation on both HSL translocation and lipolysis. Employing adenoviral and transgenic expression of a perilipin construct deficient in all six PKA sites (Peri AΔ1–6), we demonstrate that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of perilipin is not required for HSL translocation to the LD but is essential for the lipolytic action(s) of LD-associated HSL in adipocytes. Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation studies suggest that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of perilipin promotes close-range interaction with LD-associated HSL. These observations redefine the mechanism by which perilipin regulates HSL-mediated lipolysis in response to β-adrenergic stimuli. Antibodies—A polyclonal anti-perilipin antibody (22Souza S.

Perilipin Knock-out (Peri KO) Mice and Peri KO Mice Expressing the Peri AΔ1–6 Transgene in BAT (Peri AKOΔ1–6 Mice)—We generated mice with a targeted disruption of the perilipin gene by replacing exon 3 (nucleotides 3515 and 3887) with a neomycin cassette, thereby disrupting coding of all known perilipin mRNAs. The Peri KO mice were viable and exhibited predicted reductions in adipocyte size and adipose mass as previously described (20Tansey J. Sztalryd C. Gruia-Gray j. Roush D. Zeo J. Gavrilova O.

Peri KO mice were backcrossed for 10 generations to C57BL/6 mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN). We subsequently generated mice expressing a Peri AΔ1–6 transgene in adipose tissue. We first generated a mouse Peri AΔ1–6 cDNA, FLAG-tagged at the carboxyl terminus using PCR (23Zhang H. Souza S. Muliro K. Kraemer F. Obin M. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51535-51542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This cDNA was then ligated into a SmaI site of pBluescript SK vector containing the aP2 enhancer/promoter region, the SV40 small tumor antigen splice site, and polyadenylation signal sequence (a gift of Dr. B. M. Spiegelman) (34Ross S.R. Graves R.A. Greenstein A. Platt K.A. Shyu H.-L. Mellovitz B. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The general procedure for microinjection of the transgene is described elsewhere (35Brinster R.L. Chen H.Y. Trumbauer M. Senear A.W. Warren R. Palmiter R.D.

These mice were fully viable and exhibited no overt adipose phenotype (data not shown). These transgenic mice were mated with backcrossed Peri KO mice to generate Peri AKOΔ1–6 mice used in these studies. Generation and Differentiation of Stable Lines of MEF Adipocytes—Stable lines of MEF adipocytes were generated from 12.5–14.5 day embryos of Peri+/+ and Peri–/– mice as described (36Rosen E. Hsu C.-H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M. Gonzalez F. Spiegelman B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Retrovirus expressing mouse peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ in a pMSCV vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) were generously provided by Dr. Evan Rosen and transfected into phoenix cells using the manufacturer's instructions. Viral supernatants were added to MEF cells for 4 h, selected with puromycin, expanded, and frozen for later use. Selected MEF cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum. At confluence cells were exposed to a pro-differentiation regimen of dexamethasone (1 μm), insulin (5 μg/ml), isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX, 0.5 mm), and rosiglitazone (5 μm). After 2 days, cells were maintained in medium containing insulin for 4 days, then in medium without insulin for an additional 3–4 days before use. Recombinant Adenoviruses—Serine to alanine mutations were made in all six Peri A PKA sites (Ser-81, Ser-222, Ser-276, Ser-433, Ser-492, and Ser-517) using Muta-Gene Phagemid in vitro mutagenesis version 2 (Bio-Rad). Adenoviruses expressing this construct (Ad Peri AΔ1–6), wild type perilipin (Ad Peri A), or Aequoria Victoria green fluorescent protein (Ad GFP, a control for nonspecific adenoviral effects) were generated using the AdEasy™ adenoviral vector system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (23Zhang H.

Wild type perilipin and Peri AΔ1–6 were FLAG-tagged at the COOH terminus. Adenoviruses were amplified in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, purified, and concentrated to 0.6 × 1012 plaqueforming units/ml by CsCl ultracentrifugation. Isolation and in Vitro Differentiation of Brown Preadipocytes—Brown fat precursor cells were isolated from the interscapular brown adipose tissue of 5–6-week-old C57BL/6 and Peri AKOΔ1–6 mice as previously described (37Martinez-deMena R. Hernandez A. Obregon M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: 1119-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in maintenance medium (DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 100 nm sodium selenite, 3 nm insulin, 15 μm ascorbic acid, 50 mg/liter tetracycline, 50 mg/liter streptomycin, 50 mg/liter, ampicillin, and 1 mg/liter Fungizone (Invitrogen)). Precursors were seeded at 15,000–20,000 cells/cm2 in 12-well plates or in 35-mm coverslip-bottom dishes for lipolysis and immunostaining studies, respectively. After they attained confluence (day 0), cells were cultured for 2 days in differentiation medium (DMEM containing 0.5 mm IBMX, 0.5 mm dexamethasone, and 125 mm indomethacin (38Klein J. Fasshauer M.

Recombinant Adenovirus Expressing Small Hairpin RNA (shRNA) for Murine HSL—HSL shRNA design was based on accession number NM010719 (sequence GCAAGAGTATGTC ACGCTA) (Welgen, Inc., Worcester, MA). A “scrambled” version of this HSL shRNA (CGCGCTTTGTAGGATTCA) was also generated as a control for nonspecific effects of shRNA on lipolysis. Both HSL shRNA and the scrambled shRNA were cloned into the pQuiet vector to generate recombinant adenoviruses. Adenovirus-mediated Expression of Perilipins or shRNAs in MEF–/– Adipocytes—Recombinant adenovirus was transduced in Peri–/– MEFs with Lipofectamine Plus™ reagent (Invitrogen) on days 2 (shRNA) or 3 (perilipins) after induction of differentiation. To assure comparable levels of adenovirally induced protein expression, each adenovirus was pre- and post-titered using Western blots and densitometry of cell lysates (22Souza S. Muliro K. Liscum L.

Lipolysis Assays—Before lipolysis assays, differentiated brown adipocytes were incubated overnight in insulin/serum-free medium with 2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (DMEM/BSA). MEF adipocytes were incubated for ≥4 h in the same medium. For lipolysis assays, adipocytes were incubated for either 40 min (brown adipocytes) or 2 h (MEF adipocytes) in DMEM/BSA containing 200 nm phenyl isopropyl adenosine (PIA) (basal condition) or in PIA and 10 μm norepinephrine (NE) (brown adipocytes) or PIA and 20 μm forskolin (MEF adipocytes). The medium was then collected, and established procedures were used to quantify glycerol and fatty acids as indices of HSL-mediated and total lipolysis, respectively (22Souza S. Muliro K. Liscum L.

Yamamoto M. Franciosa M. Lien P. Greenberg A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Insulin-dependent Glucose Uptake—Insulin-dependent glucose uptake was measured in MEF adipocytes using insulin and the 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake assay as previously described (40Gross D.N. Farmer S.R. Pilch P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7151-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—After serum depletion, cells were treated for 15 min with either 200 nm PIA to repress adenyl cyclase activity (basal condition) or with 20 μm forskolin plus 0.5 mm IBMX (stimulated condition) followed by fixation and incubation with antibodies recognizing either perilipin or HSL. Differentiated brown adipocytes were treated for 15 min with either 200 nm PIA or 10 μm NE. Images were acquired with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope equipped with an acoustico-optical beam splitter. Subcellular Fractionation—Differentiated MEF–/– adipocytes were incubated in differentiation medium containing palmitic and oleic acid (240 μm each) for 48 h. After overnight serum depletion, adipocytes were treated for 13 min with 200 nm PIA (basal state) or 20 μm forskolin plus 0.5 mm IBMX (stimulated state), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then maintained for 10 min in hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) containing 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and either PIA or forskolin plus IBMX. Cells were homogenized on ice, and homogenates were centrifuged (12,000 rpm) at 4 °C for 20 min to separate fat cake (FC, upper layer containing lipid droplets) or supernatant (SP, lower layer) and a membrane pellet. The FC layer was isolated with a tube cutter and placed in a fresh tube. The SP was subjected to multiple rounds of centrifugation and removal of the residual FC until almost no FC fraction was visible. Then the lower portion of the SP fraction was harvested by needle aspiration and removed to a fresh tube. The pooled FC fractions were washed with 1 ml of fresh lysis buffer, collected (as above) after centrifugation, and resuspended in fresh lysis buffer. Half of this FC suspension was used for TAG measurement. The remaining half was incubated with SDS lysis buffer (10% final) at 37 °C for 30 min with vortexing and then centrifuged for 10 min, after which the final FC fraction was harvested. One-thirtieth (by volume) of each fraction was loaded on SDS-PAGE gels and then Western-blotted for perilipin and HSL. The FC isolation procedure resulted in minor differences in the total FC fraction recovered. Therefore, FC sample volumes were adjusted based on TG content to ensure that equivalent amounts of FC were loaded from basal and PKA-stimulated samples. Perilipin-HSL Cross-linking and Co-immunoprecipitation—Differentiated MEF–/– adipocytes expressing GFP, FLAG-tagged Peri A, or FLAG-tagged Peri AΔ1–6 were incubated as described (above) for cell fractionation studies with the exception that Hepes (pH 7.4) replaced Tris in the hypotonic buffer. Cells were then harvested and hand-homogenized on ice. 3,3′-Dithiobis sulfosuccinimidyl propionate (DTSSP), a cross-linker with a 12-Ä spacer arm length (Pierce) was added to the homogenates and incubated with rotation at room temperature for 30 min as per the manufacturer's instructions. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by the addition of Tris-HCl (50 mm final). After the addition of Triton X-100 (2% final) and NaCl (75 mm final), samples were drawn through a 23-gauge needle and then centrifuged (12,000 rpm) at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant and FC were purified as for the subcellular fractionation studies (see above). Western blotting confirmed that >95% of perilipin was removed from the LD and present in the SP fraction. The SP fraction was immunoprecipitated using the FLAG® Tagged Protein Immunoprecipitation kit (Sigma) at 4 °C for 24 h with rotation. Immunoprecipitates were eluted from pelleted anti-FLAG-agarose beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol. The reducing conditions are sufficient to break the 3,3′-dithiob"
https://openalex.org/W2115137014,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV, or SCV), which caused a world-wide epidemic in 2002 and 2003, binds to a receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its envelope (spike, S) glycoprotein. The RBD is very immunogenic; it is a major SCV neutralization determinant and can elicit potent neutralizing antibodies capable of out-competing ACE2. However, the structural basis of RBD immunogenicity, RBD-mediated neutralization, and the role of RBD in entry steps following its binding to ACE2 have not been elucidated. By mimicking immune responses with the use of RBD as an antigen to screen a large human antibody library derived from healthy volunteers, we identified a novel potent cross-reactive SCV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, m396, which competes with ACE2 for binding to RBD, and determined the crystal structure of the RBD-antibody complex at 2.3-Ä resolution. The antibody-bound RBD structure is completely defined, revealing two previously unresolved segments (residues 376–381 and 503–512) and a new disulfide bond (between residues 378 and 511). Interestingly, the overall structure of the m396-bound RBD is not significantly different from that of the ACE2-bound RBD. The antibody epitope is dominated by a 10-residue-long protruding β6–β7 loop with two putative ACE2-binding hotspot residues (Ile-489 and Tyr-491). These results provide a structural rationale for the function of a major determinant of SCV immunogenicity and neutralization, the development of SCV therapeutics based on the antibody paratope and epitope, and a retrovaccinology approach for the design of anti-SCV vaccines. The available structural information indicates that the SCV entry may not be mediated by ACE2-induced conformational changes in the RBD but may involve other conformational changes or/and yet to be identified coreceptors.

Although there have been no recent outbreaks, the need to develop potent therapeutics and vaccines against a re-emerging SCV or a related virus remains of high priority. The amazingly rapid pace of SARS research for the last few years has resulted in a wealth of information for the virus, especially about its interactions with the host leading to disease and immune responses, which could also be helpful for the development of strategies to cope with other viral pathogens including influenza and HIV. Entry of viruses into animal cells is initiated by binding to cell-surface-associated receptors and can be prevented by neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) targeting the virus receptor-binding site (5Dimitrov D.S. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 6Smith A.E. Helenius A. Science. 2004; 304: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar).

To understand the structural mechanisms underlying SCV immunogenicity and neutralization and help in the design of vaccines capable of eliciting predetermined highly effective neutralizing antibodies, we used a retrovaccinology (19Burton D.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) approach based on the combination of phage display and x-ray crystallography. The SCV is a member of the genus Coronavirus, which belongs to the Coronaviridae family of the order Nidovirales, which also includes families Arteriviridae and Roniviridae. Not only SCV but also other nidoviruses can infect humans and animals, resulting in a variety of severe diseases. The infection is initiated by the attachment of virus envelope glycoproteins (Envs) to receptors, which can be blocked by nAbs. The structural mechanisms of receptor recognition and neutralization by antibodies against any nidovirus were not previously known. Recently, the crystal structure of the SCV S RBD in complex with ACE2 was reported at 2.9-Ä resolution (20Li F. Li W. Farzan M. Harrison S.C. Science. 2005; 309: 1864-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). However, the structures of a receptor-free RBD and its complexes with nAbs are not known. Thus, fundamental questions related to the mechanism of SCV (and any other nidovirus) entry and neutralization, such as conformational changes induced by the binding of either the receptor or the nAbs, remain unanswered. To date, only a few structures of viral Envs complexed with nAbs are available, including Envs from influenza, picornaviruses, HIV, and West Nile virus (5Dimitrov D.S. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 21Nybakken G.E. Oliphant T. Johnson S. Burke S. Diamond M.S. Fremont D.H. Nature. 2005; 437: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar); these structures have played an essential role in elucidating the mechanisms of viral neutralization. Here, we describe the identification of a potent cross-reactive SCV-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, m396, and report the crystal structure of the antibody-antigen complex (Fab m396-SCV RBD) at 2.3-Ä resolution (Supplemental Table S1). The structure reveals a major neutralization determinant and its relationship with receptor recognition, providing structural insights into the mechanism of SCV entry and neutralization.

Dimitrov, manuscript in preparation. and used for selection of Fabs against purified, soluble, monomeric RBD, conjugated to magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-270 Epoxy, Dynal Inc., New Hyde Park, NY) following a previously described procedure (23Zhu Z. Dimitrov A.S. Bossart K.N. Crameri G. Bishop K.A. Choudhry V. Mungall B.A. Feng Y.R. Choudhary A. Zhang M.Y. Feng Y. Wang L.F. Xiao X. Eaton B.T. Broder C.C. Dimitrov D.S. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, amplified libraries of 1012 phage-displayed Fabs were incubated with 5, 3, and 1 μg of RBD in a 500-μl volume for 2 h at room temperature during the first, second, an third rounds of biopanning, respectively. After the third round of biopanning, 95 clones were randomly picked from the infected TG1 cells, and phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to identify clones of phage displaying Fabs with high binding affinity. Eight clones that bound to the RBD with A450 > 1.0 were selected for further characterization. The VH and VL domains (VH and VL denote the variable domains of heavy and light chains, respectively) of these clones were sequenced. The sequences were identical for all selected clones, and the selected Fab was designated as m396. The Fab used for crystallization was purified with a HiTrap nickel-chelating column followed by a Superdex 75 10/300GL column, using phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl, and concentrated to 10–20 mg/ml. For its conversion to IgG1, the Fab heavy and light chains were amplified and re-cloned in the pDR12 vector (provided by D. Burton, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) with the Fc gene fragment replaced with cDNA sequence instead of genomic DNA. Affinity Determination by Surface Plasmon Resonance—Interactions between m396 and SCV RBD were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance technology using a BIAcore 1000 instrument (Amersham Biosciences). The SCV RBD was covalently immobilized onto a sensor chip (CM5) using carbodiimide coupling chemistry. A control reference surface was prepared for nonspecific binding and refractive index changes. For analysis of the kinetics of interactions, various concentrations of Fab or IgG m396 were injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min using running buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% P-20 (pH 7.4). The association and dissociation phase data were fitted simultaneously to a 1:1 Langmuir global model by using the nonlinear data analysis program BIAevaluation 4.1. All the experiments were performed at 25 °C. Crystallization and Structure Determination—The SCV RBD-Fab m396 complex was formed by mixing individual components in a 1:1 molar ratio and incubating overnight at 4 °C. Crystals were obtained within 2–3 weeks by sitting-drop vapor diffusion technique. The reservoir solution was composed of 15% v/v glycerol, 20% polyethylene glycol 6000, 100 mm MES sodium at pH 6.5; crystals formed only in the drops with a 1:2 ratio for the protein and the reservoir solutions. The crystals of Fab m396 were grown with the sitting-drop vapor diffusion technique within 2 weeks. The reservoir solution was composed of 20% v/v glycerol, 16% v/v ethylene glycol, 20% w/v polyethylene glycol 6000, and 100 mm NaCl in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). Data sets up to 2.3-Ä resolution were collected at cryogenic temperature (100 K) for both the RBD-Fab complex and the unliganded Fab, each from a single crystal, at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team beamline facility 22-ID of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Data processing was carried out with the HKL2000 program suite (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER (25Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar), using the SCV RBD from the receptor complex (PDB code 2AJF) and four individual domains of Fab (VH,VL,CH, and CL)(CH and CL refer to the constant domains of heavy and light chains, respectively) from three different antibody structures (PDB codes: 1ZA6 for CH and CL, 1RZG for VH, and 1W72 for VL) as search models. The RBM (residues 430–490) of SCV RBD and most of the CDRs (complementarity-determining regions) of Fab models, which were not included in the search models, were built on the basis of difference electron density. The complex was refined with CNS (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) at 2.3-Ä resolution. A total of 298 water molecules, a phosphate ion, and one N-linked glucosamine moiety at Asn-330 were added at the final stage of the refinement. The final R and Rfree values were 19.8 and 26.1, respectively. The unliganded Fab m396 structure was solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe (27Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar), using the constant domains of Fab m396 from the complex structure as the search model. The difference electron density map revealed the location of variable domains. The structure was refined using CNS (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and a total of 176 water molecules was added at the final stage of the refinement. The final R and Rfree values were 22.8 and 27.7, respectively. The O program (28Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) was used for model building for both structures. Data collection, processing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Supplemental Table S1. Previously, we identified several S glycoprotein fragments, containing the RBD, which is a major SCV neutralization determinant (12He Y. Zhou Y. Liu S. Kou Z. Li W. Farzan M. Jiang S. Biochem.

J. 2005; 2: 73Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). One of these fragments, containing residues 317–518, was cloned into a baculovirus vector, expressed in insect cells, and purified. This fragment was used as a selecting antigen for panning of a large (∼1010 different antibodies) human antibody Fab library, which we constructed from the B lymphocytes of 10 healthy volunteers. Recently, this library was also used for the selection of potent nAbs against Hendra and Nipah viruses (23Zhu Z. Dimitrov A.S. Bossart K.N. Crameri G. Bishop K.A. Choudhry V. Mungall B.A. Feng Y.R. Choudhary A. Zhang M.Y. Feng Y. Wang L.F. Xiao X. Eaton B.T. Broder C.C. Dimitrov D.S. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The Fab with the strongest binding to the RBD, m396, was converted to full antibody (IgG1), expressed, and purified. We measured the binding rate constants and affinities of the Fab and the IgG1 m396 to SCV RBD in a BIAcore assay (Supplemental Fig. S1). With two independent experiments, we determined Kon = 3.0 (±0.3) and 4 (±3) × 105 m–1 s–1, Koff = 6.1 (±0.6) × 10–3 s–1 and2(±1) × 10–5 s–1, and KD = 20 (±0) nm and 4.6 (±0.9) pm, for the Fab and the IgG1 m369, respectively. The high apparent affinity (avidity) observed for IgG1 m369 is due to the effective multivalency of the surface-associated antigen binding to the bivalent IgG1. Further, we found that the antibody potently inhibited 1) cell fusion and pseudovirus entry mediated by the SCV (Tor2 isolate) S glycoprotein with an IC50 of 0.6 and 0.01 μg/ml, respectively, 2) SCV entry mediated by the S glycoprotein from the GD03T0013 isolate, which is not neutralizable by other known human monoclonal antibodies, including 80R (29Sui J.

S., manuscript to be submitted. The structure of the SCV RBD-Fab m396 complex is depicted in Fig. 1. The overall RBD structure in the complex with Fab m396 is similar to that in the complex with ACE2 (20Li F. Li W. Farzan M. Harrison S.C. Science. 2005; 309: 1864-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). The root mean square deviation between the common Cα positions in the two RBD structures is 1.3 Ä. However, the new RBD structure reveals a total of 16 amino acid residues localized in two segments (residues 376–381 and 503–512 are shown in brown) that were missing in the RBD·ACE2 complex. The antibody-bound RBD structure also reveals a new disulfide bond between residues 378 and 511 (Fig. 2), which was not observed in the RBD·ACE2 complex. As shown in Fig. 1, the RBD consists of a core, which includes a five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (β1–β4 and β7), and a long extended loop, which contains a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (β5–β6) in the middle. The complete RBD structure contains eight cysteines that form four disulfide bridges, three in the core and one in the extended loop.FIGURE 2Comparison of the RBD·Fab and the RBD·ACE2 structures.

The four CDRs form a shallow cleft on the surface of the antibody-variable regions, providing a deep binding pocket into which the β6–β7 loop fits tightly. The tip of this loop is a type I β-turn (Gly-Ile-Gly-Tyr, residues 488–491) and is deeply buried in the antibody-combining site, which is a feature most commonly observed in antibody·peptide complexes (33Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The same feature involving the recognition of a similar sequence motif (Gly-Pro-Gly-Arg, residues 312–315) has been recently noted at the tip of the gp120 V3 structure (34Huang C.C. Tang M. Zhang M.Y. Majeed S. Montabana E. Stanfield R.L. Dimitrov D.S. Korber B. Sodroski J. Wilson I.A. Wyatt R. Kwong P.D. Science. 2005; 310: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), which is a major neutralizing determinant of HIV. Most residues in the β6–β7 loop interact with Fab m396 at the binding pocket, and particularly, residues Ile-489 and Tyr-491 from the β-turn penetrate into the deep pocket on the surface of the antibody-combining site. Fifteen residues from the RBD and the Fab participate in the formation of the RBD-antibody interface as defined by a contact distance of 3.5 Ä between the two molecules. The shape correlation statistical parameter (Sc) (35Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), a measure of geometric fit between two juxtaposed surfaces (maximum value, 1.0), calculated for the RBD-antibody interface is 0.66, indicating a high degree of shape complementarity. A total surface area of 1760 Ä2 is buried at the interface of the complex with nearly equal contributions from the two molecules (870 Ä2 from the RBD and 890 Ä2 from the antibody) as determined with a 1.4-Ä probe. The antibody-binding β6–β7 loop alone accounts for 63% of the RBD-antibody interface, which indicates the dominant role of the loop residues in the binding of the two molecules. The heavy chain CDRs contributes 66% of the total surface of the antibody-combining site. The size of the binding interface is close to the average of other antigen·antibody complexes (36Davies D.R. Cohen G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The intermolecular interactions include van der Waals contacts and direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds (Supplemental Table S2). The details of the buried surface area at the interface between the antibody and the SCV RBD are given in Supplemental Table S3. The key interactions in the RBD·antibody complex are mostly between the β6–β7 loop of the RBD and the four CDRs (H1, H2, H3, and L3) of Fab m396. These interactions are clearly defined (Fig. 3). H1 makes contacts with hydrophobic residues Tyr-484, Thr-486, and Thr-487; particularly Thr-33 of H1 is in direct contact with the amide nitrogen of Gly-488 in RBD (Fig. 3a). A similar interaction is found in the RBD·ACE2 complex where the amide of Gly-488 is engaged in a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Lys-35 in ACE2. Compared with other CDRs, H2 plays a dominant role in RBD binding; the most conspicuous feature is the burial of Tyr-491 of RBD (122 Ä2) in the shallow cleft rendered by H2, where the amino group of Asn-58 contacts the phenolic oxygen atom of Tyr-491 and the side chain of Thr-52 forms an aromatic on-face hydrogen bond with the π -cloud of Tyr-491 (Fig. 3b). Val-97 is the only residue from H3 that interacts with RBD (Fig. 3c); however, it buries the largest surface area per residue (108 Ä2) among all CDR residues that interact with RBD. The carbonyl oxygen atom of Val-97 forms a strong hydrogen bond with the amino nitrogen of the RBD residue Gln-492 with a distance of 2.7 Ä. Such hydrogen bonds between main-chain and side-chain atoms play an important role in determining the relative orientation of the RBD and the antibody in the complex, and contribute to the specificity of the interactions. The Sc parameter calculated for the heavy chain-RBD interaction has a high value of 0.74, which suggests a highly correlated interfacial geometry for the heavy chain-RBD recognition. L3-RBD interaction involves water molecules and additional side chains, including Arg-395, of RBD (Fig. 3d, Supplemental Table S2). Residue Trp-91 of L3 stacks with aromatic residue Ile-489, a major hot spot in the RBD; each of the two residues buries a surface area of ∼100 Ä2 at the interface. The minor binding sites on the RBD include two residues in β2 (Thr-363 and Lys-365), the 310 helix followed by β3 (Lys-390, Gly-391, Asp-392, and Arg-395), and residues Arg-426 and Tyr-436. Apart from the minor contributions of these residues to antibody binding, most of them have significant roles in stabilizing the conformation of the β6–β7 loop. For example, the amide hydrogen atoms of Gly-391 and Asp-392 hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyls of Gln-492 and Gly-490, respectively; the guanidinium group of Arg-426 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of Thr-485; and the phenolic oxygen atoms from side chains of Tyr-436 and Tyr-484 are hydrogen-bonded. All these hydrogen bonds help stabilizing the β6–β7 loop conformation in the RBD. The RBD-antibody interface has two major characteristic features: the high level of complementarity between the interacting surfaces and the anchoring of the putative major hotspot RBD residue Tyr-491"

They consist of 80-kDa catalytic subunits encoded by the capn1 and capn2 genes, respectively, and a common 28-kDa regulatory subunit encoded by the capn4 gene. The regulatory subunit is required to maintain the stability and activity of μ- and m-calpains. Accordingly, genetic disruption of capn4 in the mouse eliminated both ubiquitous calpain activities. In embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice, calpain deficiency correlated with resistance to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis, and this was directly related to a calpain requirement for activation of both caspase-12 and the ASK1-JNK cascade. This study provides compelling genetic evidence for calpain's role in caspase-12 activation at the ER, and reveals a novel role for the ubiquitous calpains in ER-stress induced apoptosis and JNK activation.

This study provides compelling genetic evidence for calpain's role in caspase-12 activation at the ER, and reveals a novel role for the ubiquitous calpains in ER-stress induced apoptosis and JNK activation. Calpains are a family of Ca2+-dependent intracellular cysteine proteases. By cleaving their protein substrates, ubiquitously expressed μ-calpain and m-calpain are implicated in a wide variety of biological functions including cell migration, cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 1Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar). Both μ- and m-calpains are heterodimers, consisting of a distinct large 80-kDa catalytic subunit, encoded by the genes capn1 and capn2, respectively, and a common small 28-kDa regulatory subunit encoded by the capn4 gene. The small subunit is essential to calpain activities, as shown by in vitro biochemical studies where a 25-amino acid truncation at the C terminus abolished all detectable calpain activity (2Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Hegadorn C. Maurice D.H. Arthur J.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This provided the rationale for the first reported capn4 knock-out mouse model, which interrupted the coding sequences in exon 9 (3Arthur J.S. Greer P.A. Elce J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and was predicted to truncate 38 C-terminal amino acids from the small subunit. The resulting hypothetical small subunit was not detectable, the steady-state levels of μ-80, m-80 catalytic subunits were reduced, and no calpain activity was observed (4Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). More recently, we have developed a conditionally targeted capn4 locus by inserting loxP sites into intron 8 and the noncoding region of exon 11. 2Y. Tan, N. Dourdin, C. Wu, T. De Veyra, J. S. Elce, and P. A. Greer, submitted publication.2Y. Tan, N. Dourdin, C. Wu, T. De Veyra, J. S. Elce, and P. A. Greer, submitted publication. This allows conditional knock-out of capn4 by Cre-mediated recombination. Although a hypothetical small subunit protein with a 60-amino acid deletion at the C terminus might still be produced, no detectable small subunit was detected, probably because of destabilization of the hypothetical truncated protein. Expression of the large subunits was also greatly diminished, supporting the proposed role for the small subunit in stabilizing large subunits.

Tan, N. Dourdin, C. Wu, T. De Veyra, J. S. Elce, and P. A. Greer, submitted publication. Many reports on calpain function are based on using small molecule inhibitors, which lack specificity. In contrast, this genetic knock-out model is completely selective, and therefore provides a powerful tool to address the physiological functions of the ubiquitous calpains. Ubiquitous μ- and m-calpains have been suggested to participate in apoptosis by cleaving either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic proteins like p53, Bcl-2, and Bax, depending on the nature of the stimuli and type of cells involved (6Benetti R. Del Sal G. Monte M. Paroni G. Brancolini C. Schneider C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2702-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7Chen M. He H. Zhan S. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Gottlieb R.A. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Among these studies, m-calpain was proposed to play a role in a distinct apoptotic pathway initiated by ER stress (9Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). The ER plays key roles in protein biosynthesis, modification, folding, and trafficking, and it is also the major pool for calcium storage. Perturbation of ER homeostasis abolishes protein folding, and the consequent accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER imposes so called ER stress on the cell. The ER membrane residing proteins IRE1, Perk, and ATF6 are ER stress sensors, which are maintained in an inactive monomeric state by binding to the chaperone protein Bip. During ER stress, the release of Bip activates these sensors to convey their protective responses, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). This includes enhancing the transcription of genes encoding ER chaperones and the attenuation of general protein synthesis (10Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 827-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylated IRE1 possesses an endoribonuclease activity that alternatively splices the mRNA encoding the transcription factor XBP-1, thus turning on chaperone genes (11Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar). The activated Perk kinase phosphorylates eIF-2α and inhibits general protein synthesis (12Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). Also, the unfolded proteins trigger ATF6 cleavage by the Site-1 and Site-2 proteases to release its cytoplasmic domain, which then enters the nucleus and activates Bip transcription (13Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). ER stress can be induced by pharmacological agents such as the calcium ionophore A23187, the Ca2+ pump inhibitor thapsigargin, the N-linked glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, the ER to Golgi transport inhibitor brefeldin A, and inhibitors of disulfide bond formation such as dithiothreitol (14Breckenridge D.G.

Excessive ER stress can trigger cellular apoptosis through the activation of caspase-12, which resides on the outside of ER membrane, and is cleaved and activated during ER stress (15Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). As an initiator caspase, caspase-12 triggers the activation of caspases-9, -7, and -3 in a cytochrome c and Apaf-1-independent manner (16Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y.

Caspase-12 knock-out cells are resistant to ER stress-induced apoptosis (15Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). In vitro biochemical and calpain inhibitor studies in glial cells suggested that m-calpain is responsible for the cleavage of caspase-12 during ER stress (9Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Besides its role in ER stress induced apoptosis, calpain might also participate in a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway by cleaving and thus releasing apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the inner mitochondrial membrane (18Jayanthi S. Deng X. Noailles P.A. Ladenheim B. Cadet J.L. Faseb. J. 2004; 18: 238-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 19Polster B.M. Basanez G. Etxebarria A. Hardwick J.M. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol.

Methamphetamine induced apoptosis of striatal glutamic acid decarboxylase containing neurons through the rapid and simultaneous activation of calpain and caspase-12, and release of AIF and cytochrome c from the mitochondria (18Jayanthi S. Deng X. Noailles P.A. Ladenheim B. Cadet J.L. Faseb. J. 2004; 18: 238-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Calpain activation was persistent under those conditions, so it might have further participated in other downstream apoptotic signaling events. Surprisingly, the activation of caspase-9 in this system was not synergistically accelerated, but delayed (18Jayanthi S. Deng X. Noailles P.A. Ladenheim B. Cadet J.L. Faseb. J. 2004; 18: 238-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In vitro studies suggested that calpain-mediated cleavage of an N-terminal AIF domain is required to allow its release from Bid-permeabilized mitochondria (19Polster B.M. Basanez G. Etxebarria A. Hardwick J.M. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6447-6454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Calpains might also mediate cross-talk between mitochondrial and ER apoptotic pathways depending on the nature of the apoptotic stimuli and the cell type. In mouse pancreatic β-islet cells, apoptosis induced by type 2 ryanodine receptor-mediated calcium overloading of mitochondria relies on calpain-10 up-regulation and activation (21Johnson J.D. Han Z. Otani K. Ye H. Zhang Y. Wu H. Horikawa Y. Misler S. Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24794-24802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, polymorphisms in calpain-10 are linked to human susceptibility to type II diabetes. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is also activated in response to ER stress by IRE1, a serine/threonine kinase, which gets autophosphorylated during UPR. Activated IRE1 recruits TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), which in turn activates the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase ASK1, which in turn activates the MKK4/JNK cascade (22Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar, 23Nishitoh H. Matsuzawa A. Tobiume K. Saegusa K. Takeda K. Inoue K.

Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Although the precise role of JNK in ER stress is not defined, prolonged JNK activation has pro-apoptotic functions downstream of various cell death-inducing stimuli, including TNFα, H2O2, and DNA-damaging agents (25Deng Y. Ren X. Yang L. Lin Y. Wu X. Cell. 2003; 115: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 26Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). Interestingly, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) knock-out cells, which are not capable of activating the IRE1-JNK pathway after ER stress are resistant to apoptosis (27Gu F. Nguyen D.T. Stuible M. Dube N. Tremblay M.L. Chevet E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49689-49693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role of the ubiquitous calpains in ER stress. MEFs from conditional capn4 knock-out animals were used to establish a role for calpain in two key ER stress apoptosis pathways. We show that calpain-deficient MEFs were resistant to thapsigargin (TG) and tunicamycin (TN)-induced apoptosis. This resistance correlated with a defect in the activation of the caspase-12, -9, -3 cascade and the ASK1/MKK4/JNK/c-Jun cascade. These observations provide compelling genetic and biochemical evidence for a central role for calpain in the conversion of Ca+2 signals from the stressed ER to the caspase-12 apoptotic pathway and JNK activation. Reagents—Tunicamycin, thapsigargin, propidium iodide (PI), trypan blue and acridine orange (AO) were purchased from Sigma. ER-Tracker Red was from Invitrogen Molecular Probes and Annexin-V-PE/7-aminoactinomycin (7-AAD) was from BD Biosciences/Clontech. Anti-μ-calpain, cytochrome-c, Bcl-2, Bax, BclxL and BclsL antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody against both the large (m-80) and small (28-kDa) subunits of m-calpain was previously described (4Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The pEGFP-m80 plasmid was previously described (28Larsen A.K. De Veyra T. Jia Z. Wells A. Dutt P. Elce J.S. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 33: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Conditional capn4-targeted Allele—The generation of mice harboring a targeted floxed (loxP-flanked) capn4 allele is described elsewhere.2 Briefly, calpain small subunit coding sequences in exons 9, 10, and 11 were flanked by two loxP sites. An internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-lacZ reporter and PGK promoter-Neo selectable gene cassette were inserted after the coding sequences in exon 11 and before the second loxP site to permit X-gal staining and G418 selection. Cre recombinase-mediated excision of sequences between the loxP sites deleted the intervening sequences as well as the lacZ/Neo cassette. We refer to this allele as capn4PZ/PZ before Cre-mediated excision, and capn4P/P after excision. In order to achieve ubiquitous loss of calpain activity, these mice were crossed with a transgenic line which expresses Cre recombinase under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, referred to as cmv-cre (29Dupe V. Davenne M. Brocard J. Dolle P. Mark M. Dierich A. Chambon P. Rijli F.M. Development. 1997; 124: 399-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The capn4P/P; cmv-cre embryos derived from the capn4+/P; cmv-cre x capn4PZ/PZ breeding pairs died at approximately embryonic day (E) 11.5. Cell Culture—Primary fibroblast cultures were established from E10.5 embryos. The yolk sacs, heads, and internal organs were isolated and used for genotyping by Southern blot hybridization. Carcasses were treated with 0.25% collagenase in 20% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with media and plated in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Primary MEFs were used in experiments before the third passage. Spontaneously immortalized MEFs were established as previously described (30Todaro G.J. Wolman S.R. Green H. J. Cell Physiol. 1963; 62: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary MEFs were seeded in 60-mm plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/plate and maintained at that density by passage every 3 days. Immortalized MEFs were established between the 13th and 16th passages. Lentivirus-mediated Gene Transduction—Lentiviral vectors (pWPXLD, pWPI) were kindly provided by Dr. Trono at University of Geneva. The IRES sequence was excised from pWPI and inserted before the EGFP sequence in pWPXLD using blunt-end ligation. The murine capn4 cDNA was cloned using RT-PCR (forward primer ATCCGACTCAGCTGCGAT; reverse primer TTGAGCTCTGGCTGCTGA) and inserted at a PmeI site upstream of the IRES. Lentivirus was produced by transfecting 293T cells with pWPXLD and the packaging plasmids pMD2G and pCMV-dR8.74 as described (31Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was determined by infecting MEFs with different titrations of virus-containing supernatant and measuring the percentage of GFP-positive cells using flow cytometry. To rescue calpain activity, immortalized capn4P/P; cre MEFs were transduced with lentiviruses encoding recombinant mouse capn4. Apoptosis Analysis—MEFs were seeded at 3 × 105 cells per 60 mm plate and allowed to adhere overnight. On the following day, cells were treated with 3 μg/ml tunicamycin (TN) or 5 μm thapsigargin (TG) for the indicated periods. Mock treated cells were exposed to equivalent concentrations of the vehicle, Me2SO. Apoptosis was measured by 0.4% trypan blue exclusion assays and flow cytometry analysis of PE-conjugated Annexin-V and 7-AAD staining, according to the suppliers instructions. Alternatively, apoptotic cells were quantified by measuring the fraction of cells with a sub-G1 content of PI-staining DNA (32Crissman H.A. Steinkamp J.A. Eur. J. Histochem. 1993; 37: 129-138PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of Lysosome Stability—Cells were exposed to 5 μg/ml acridine orange (AO) for 15 min under standard culture conditions, then released by trypsin treatment and washed twice with medium. Red fluorescence was measured immediately by flow cytometry. Cells with decreased red fluorescence (pale cells) were gated, and their percentages were determined. Western Blotting—Cell monolayers were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, then incubated for 15 min on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin). Cell lysates were scraped from the dishes, transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min to remove insoluble material. Protein content was determined using the Bradford method. Samples (20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblotting was performed using specific primary antibodies, and detected using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. Release of Cytochrome c—2 × 106 cells were harvested and washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then spun at 200 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was suspended in 600-μl extraction buffer containing 220 mm mannitol, 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 50 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. After 30 min of incubation on ice, cells were treated with a Dounce homogenizer for 80 strokes and spun for 60 min at 14,000 × g. Supernatants were analyzed for cytochrome c release by Western blotting (33Hirpara J.L. Seyed M.A. Loh K.W. Dong H. Kini R.M. Pervaiz S. Blood. 2000; 95: 1773-1780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Analysis of μ- and m-calpain Activities—Calpain activities in cell extracts were detected by casein zymography in a standard Trisglycine system (34Dourdin N. Bhatt A.K. Dutt P. Greer P.A. Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Huttenlocher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48382-48388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). 40 μg of protein was resolved on 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 1.5 mg/ml casein. Calpain was activated by incubating the gels overnight with 5 mm Ca2+, and its activity was assessed by visualization of the casein-cleared regions of the gel after staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy Analysis—To examine m-calpain subcellular localization, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with an m-80-EGFP fusion protein-encoding plasmid (pEGFP-m-80) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After TG or TN treatment, cells were stained with ER-Tracker Red and imaged by confocal fluorescence microscopy using the green and red channels to visualize m80-EGFP and the ER, respectively. Co-localization was quantified using the Pearson's correlation coefficient, which was calculated using the Image-Pro Plus 5.1 software package (Media Cybernetic Inc). Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, with level of significance set at p < 0.05. Capn4P/P Cells Lack Calpain Activity and Have Reduced Expression of Calpain Subunit Proteins—Spontaneously immortalized MEFs were established from capn4+/P; cre and capn4P/P; cre embryos, and calpain activity was analyzed by in vitro casein zymograms (Fig. 1A). As expected, μ- and m-calpain activity was detected in capn4+/P; cre MEFs, but not in capn4P/P; cre cells. However, when the capn4P/P; cre MEFs were transduced with a lentivirus encoding the mouse capn4 cDNA, both μ- and m-calpain activity were restored. Western blotting analysis of these same cell lysates revealed the expected elimination of small subunit expression in capn4P/P; cre MEFs, but we also noted that steady-state levels of both μ-80 and m-80 were dramatically reduced; and this defect was also rescued by transduction with the capn4 lentivirus (Fig. 1B). ER Stress Correlated with Calpain ER Translocation and Activation—Calpain inhibitors have been reported to inhibit ER stress-induced apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-12 activation (9Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Calpain is widely distributed in the cell cytosol and is associated with membranes; and it might undergo further concentration at membranous structures and in the nucleus in response to specific signals such as calcium (35Gil-Parrado S. Popp O. Knoch T.A. Zahler S. Bestvater F. Felgentrager M. Holloschi A. Fernandez-Montalvan A. Auerswald E.A. Fritz H. Fuentes-Prior P. Machleidt W. Spiess E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16336-16346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Calpain has been localized at the plasma membrane, with cytosolic membrane surfaces, and within the lumens of the ER and Golgi apparatus (36Hood J.L. Brooks W.H. Roszman T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43126-43135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In primary MEFs, inhibition of N-linked glycosylation in the ER with tunicamycin (TN), or inhibition of the ER-localized Ca2+-ATPase with thapsigargin (TG) caused an elevation in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels by about 20%; but no difference was observed between capn4+/PZ; cre and capn4P/P; cre MEFs (data not shown). To track calpain localization during TG/TN-triggered ER stress, we performed confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis of NIH3T3 fibroblasts transfected with an m-80-EGFP fusion protein-encoding plasmid (28Larsen A.K. De Veyra T. Jia Z. Wells A. Dutt P. Elce J.S. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 33: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Recombinant m-80-EGFP was widely dispersed in the cells; however, upon TN or TG treatment, we observed a statistically significant increase in calpain ER localization as assessed by increased spectral overlap of m-80-EGFP and ER-Tracker Red (Fig. 2). This indicated that calpain was recruited to the ER in conjunction with calcium release (Fig. 2B). Calpain large subunits have a half-life of 5 days, but they are quickly degraded after activation (1Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed the stability of calpain large subunits after TG or TN treatment as an indication of their degree of activation. In primary capn4+/P; cre MEFs, m-80 subunit levels declined during TG or TN treatment (Fig. 3). Although there was substantially less m-80 subunit in primary capn4P/P; cre MEFs, that amount was further diminished after TM or TG treatment (Fig. 3). The μ-80 subunit was not as easily detected in capn4P/P; cre MEFs; however, in capn4+/P; cre MEFs, we determined that the μ-80 subunit also diminished during TN or TG treatment (Fig. 3). This disappearance of calpain catalytic subunits is consistent with the hypothesis that they are activated and subsequently degraded during ER stress. Calpain-deficient MEFs Are Resistant to Thapsigargin-induced Cell Death—To establish whether calpain is involved in the ER stress pathway, we compared TN or TG-induced apoptosis in MEFs with or without calpain. We first used primary MEFs (P-MEFs) from capn4+/P; cre and capn4P/P; cre sibling embryos to perform these apoptosis studies. Similar results were then obtained using spontaneously immortalized capn4P/P; cre MEFs (I-MEFs) and their lentiviral-capn4 rescued counterparts (Fig. 4). After 3 μg/ml TN or 5 μm TG treatment for 24 h, apoptosis was measured by trypan blue staining of total dead cells (Fig. 4A), or annexin-V and 7-AAD staining of apoptotic cells (Fig. 4B). Fewer dead cells were seen in primary capn4P/P; cre MEFs compared with the primary capn4+/P; cre MEFs in response to either TN or TG treatment. Fewer dead cells were also observed in the immortalized capn4P/P; cre MEFs compared with their capn4 rescued counterparts after TG incubation. Apoptosis was also independently assessed by flow cytometry, where cells with a sub-G1 content of PI-staining DNA were considered apoptotic (Fig. 5). This analysis also showed that calpain deficiency in either primary or immortalized MEFs correlated with resistance to ER stress-induced apoptosis. These observations support a permissive role for calpain in ER stress-induced apoptosis.FIGURE 5DNA staining profiles of cells after ER stress. Apoptotic cells were quantified by measuring the fraction of cells with a sub-G1 content of PI-staining DNA by flow cytometry. A, primary P-capn4P/P; cre and P-capn4+/P; cre MEFs were treated for 24 h with TG or TN, as indicated. B, spontaneously immortalized I-capn4P/P; cre MEFs and their lentivirus rescued counterparts (I-rescue) were treated for 30 h with TG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Calpain-deficient Cells Display Defective ER Stress-induced Activation of the Caspase-12, -9, -3 Cascade—Caspase-12 plays a pivotal role in ER stress-induced apoptosis (15Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). Like other initiator caspases, activation of pro-caspase-12 requires the cleavage of a short inhibitory peptide. Active caspase-12 can then directly activate downstream caspase-9 independently of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (9Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 16Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol.

Caspase-12-null cells were resistant to ER stress-induced apoptosis, and in vitro experiments showed that m-calpain could mediate conversion of pro-caspase-12 into an active form by cleavage of the N-terminal pro-peptide regulatory sequence (9Nakagawa T.

Cells derived from BS patients are unstable genetically and exhibit frequent sister chromatid exchanges, reflective of homologous recombination (HR) deregulation. BLM, the RecQ-like helicase mutated in BS, is found in several cellular protein complexes, all of which contain topoisomerase IIIα (Topo IIIα) and a novel protein BLAP75. Here, using highly purified human proteins, we show that BLAP75 associates independently with both Topo IIIα and BLM. Even though BLM and Topo IIIα can dissolve the double Holliday junction (DHJ) to yield non-crossover recombinants (1Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), under physiological conditions, DHJ dissolution becomes completely dependent on BLAP75. The effect of BLAP75 on BLM-Topo IIIα is highly specific, as it is not seen with the combination of Topo IIIα and Escherichia coli RecQ helicase or another human RecQ-like helicase WRN. Thus, BLM, Topo IIIα, and BLAP75 constitute a dissolvasome complex that processes HR intermediates to limit DNA crossover formation. This function of the BLM-Topo IIIα-BLAP75 dissolvasome is likely indispensable for genome maintenance and cancer avoidance.

Consistent with this characteristic, BLM, the RecQ-like helicase mutated in BS, has been found to cooperate with the type IA topoisomerase Topo IIIα to resolve the homologous recombination (HR) intermediate that harbors a double Holliday junction (DHJ) into non-crossover recombinants. This DHJ dissolution activity of the BLM-Topo IIIα complex is thought to be critical for the suppression of DNA crossover formation in mitotic cells and cancer avoidance in humans (1Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar).BLAP75 (BLM-Associated Polypeptide, 75 kDa) was first identified by Meetei et al. (2Meetei A.R. Sechi S. Wallisch M. Yang D. Young M.K. Joenje H. Hoatlin M.E. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3417-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) as a component of several BLM-containing complexes immunoprecipitable from HeLa nuclear extracts. In a subsequent study, it was shown that small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of BLAP75 causes a decrease in BLM and Topo IIIα protein levels in cells (3Yin J. Sobeck A. Xu C. Meetei A.R. Hoatlin M. Li L. Wang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Importantly, BLAP75 depletion phenocopies the increased frequency of sister chromatid exchanges characteristic of BLM-deficient cells (3Yin J. Sobeck A. Xu C. Meetei A.R. Hoatlin M. Li L. Wang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Taken together, the available evidence indicates that BLAP75 exists as a complex with BLM and Topo IIIα (henceforth referred to as the BTB complex), but the mechanistic details of this relationship remain elusive. For instance, whether BLAP75 associates directly with BLM, or through Topo IIIα, is unknown. More importantly, it is not clear whether BLAP75 influences the DHJ dissolution activity of BLM-Topo IIIα or, as suggested previously (3Yin J. Sobeck A. Xu C. Meetei A.R. Hoatlin M. Li L. Wang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), serves as a structural component to promote protein complex formation. In this study, we have carried out biochemical analyses to define the role of the BTB complex in DHJ dissolution.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of the BLAP75 Protein—BLAP75 cDNA (from the American Type Culture Collection) was placed under the T7 promoter in the vector pGEX-6P1 (GE Healthcare), which adds a cleavable amino-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tag to the BLAP75 protein. A carboxyl-terminal (His)6-tag was subsequently added by site-directed mutagenesis to generate the plasmid pGEX-BLAP75-(His)6, which was introduced into Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen). Protein expression was induced for 18 h at 16 °C with 0.2 mm IPTG. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C. All the subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Extract from 50 g of cell paste was prepared by sonication in 250 ml of cell breakage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 600 mm KCl, 0.01% Igepal, 1 mm DTT, and the following protease inhibitors: aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A at 3 μg/ml each, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The extract was clarified by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 90 min) and then treated with ammonium sulfate (0.24 g/ml). Precipitated proteins were harvested by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 30 min) and redissolved in 100 ml of K buffer (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Igepal, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors) with 800 mm KCl, and mixed with 2 ml glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the matrix with 40 ml of K buffer containing 500 mm KCl, the bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm glutathione in K buffer containing 150 mm KCl. Peak fractions were pooled and loaded directly onto a 1 ml Source Q column (GE Healthcare), which was washed with 10 ml of K buffer containing 150 mm KCl and then eluted with a 12 ml gradient of 150–850 mm KCl in K buffer. The BLAP75 peak fractions (∼300–450 mm KCl) were pooled and mixed with 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetate-agarose (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 20 ml of K buffer containing 300 mm KCl and 10 mm imidazole before eluting BLAP75 with a 12-ml gradient of 10–300 mm imidazole in K buffer containing 150 mm KCl. The peak fractions (∼160–210 mm imidazole) were pooled and loaded onto a 0.5-ml Mono Q column (GE Healthcare), which was washed with 5 ml K buffer containing 150 mm KCl and then eluted with a 6-ml gradient of 150–850 mm KCl in K buffer. Peak fractions (∼400–500 mm KCl) were pooled and concentrated to ∼2 mg/ml in a Centricon 30 device (Millipore). Approximately 500 μg of BLAP75 was obtained. The concentration of BLAP75 was determined by densitometric comparison of multiple loadings of the purified protein against known amounts of bovine serum albumin and β-galactosidase in a Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gel.Expression and Purification of Other Proteins—Human BLM protein tagged with a (His)6 affinity epitope at its carboxyl terminus was purified from yeast cells tailored to express this protein (4Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30611-30614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) using a multistep procedure, details of which will be described elsewhere. Human topoisomerase IIIα cDNA containing an amino-terminal (His)6 affinity tag was subcloned into the bacterial vector pRSFDuet-1 (Novagen). A multistep protocol (to be described elsewhere) was developed for the purification of Topo IIIα. Recombinant (His)6-tagged WRN protein was purified from a baculovirus/insect cell expression system using a multistep procedure modified from the published protocol (5Orren D.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar); the details of this procedure will be described elsewhere. Purified E. coli RecQ protein was a gift from Stephen Kowalczykowski. Protein concentrations were determined as described above.BLM-Topo IIIα Co-immunoprecipitation—Purified BLM and Topo IIIα, 3 μg each, were incubated in 30 μl of K buffer containing 150 mm KCl at 4 °C for 10 min and then rabbit polyclonal anti-BLM antibody (0.4 μl of a 1:5 dilution of ab476, Abcam Ltd.) was added, followed by another 30-min incubation at 4 °C. To capture BLM and associated Topo IIIα, the reactions were incubated for 30 min with 10 μl of protein-G-coupled magnetic beads (Dynal Biotech) with gentle mixing. The beads were isolated using a magnet, and after washing the beads twice with 30 μl of K buffer containing 150 mm KCl, the bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. The supernatant that contained unbound proteins, the wash, and the SDS eluate, 10 μl each, were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue to visualize the proteins.GST Pulldown Assay—For GST-pulldown experiments, GST-tagged BLAP75 without the (His)6-tag (3 μg) was incubated with purified BLM, Topo IIIα, WRN, or E. coli RecQ, 3 μg each, in 30 μl of K buffer containing 100 mm KCl at 4 °C for 10 min. The protein solutions were mixed with 5 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for an additional 30 min at 4 °C with gentle mixing. After washing the beads twice with 30 μl of K buffer containing 100 mm KCl, the bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. The supernatant, wash, and SDS eluate, 10 μl each, were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue. (His)6-tagged Topo IIIα was visualized via Western blotting using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-histidine antibodies (Sigma).DHJ Dissolution Assay—The DHJ substrate was prepared by hybridizing and ligating two oligonucleotides, 32P-labeled B1 and unlabeled R1, as described previously (1Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 6Fu T.J. Tse-Dinh Y.C. Seeman N.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Following ligation, the reaction was mixed with an equal volume of 90% formamide in TAE buffer (30 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA) containing bromphenol blue (0.08%), heated at 95 °C for 5 min to dissociate all the unligated oligonucleotides, and then resolved in an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 20% formamide and 8 m urea in TAE buffer at 55 °C. The portion of the gel containing the DHJ was excised, and the DNA within was electroeluted into TAE buffer in a dialysis tubing. The DHJ substrate was concentrated in a Centricon YM-30 device (Millipore) and then filter dialyzed into TE (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA).The DHJ dissolution reaction (Fig. 3, A and B) was carried out in the following manner: various mixtures of BLM (10.5 nm), Topo IIIα (100 nm), and the indicated amounts of BLAP75 were incubated for 10 min on ice in 11.5 μlof reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, 80 mm or higher levels of KCl, and an ATP regenerating system consisting of 10 mm creatine phosphate and 50 μg/ml creatine kinase) followed by the incorporation of the DHJ substrate (1.2 nm) in 1 μl. After a 5-min incubation at 37 °C, 2 μl of 10% SDS and 0.5 μlof proteinase K (10 μg/μl stock) were added to the reaction mixtures, followed by a 3-min incubation at 37 °C. The deproteinized reactions were mixed with an equal volume of sample loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50% glycerol, and 0.08% Orange G) containing 50% urea, incubated at 95 °C for 3 min, and then resolved in 8% denaturing gels, as above. In Fig. 3C, E. coli RecQ or WRN, 15 nm each, was incubated with Topo IIIα and/or BLAP75 as described for BLM above.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBLAP75 cDNA harboring a carboxyl-terminal (His)6-tag and a cleavable amino-terminal GST-tag was constructed and placed under an IPTG-inducible T7 promoter for expression in E. coli. Cells harboring the GST-BLAP75 expression plasmid were treated with IPTG to induce protein expression. Coomassie Blue staining of bacterial extracts revealed a ∼110-kDa protein species that was absent in uninduced cells (Fig. 1A). We confirmed that this protein was BLAP75 by immunoblot analysis with anti-GST antibodies (Fig. 1A). For BLAP75 purification, E. coli lysate was subjected to precipitation with ammonium sulfate, followed by two chromatographic fractionation steps and affinity purification using glutathione-Sepharose and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate-agarose (Fig. 1, B and C). We could remove the NH2-terminal GST-tag from BLAP75 by treatment with the PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare). However, control experiments revealed no functional difference between the GST-cleaved and non-cleaved forms of BLAP75 (data not shown). Several independently purified BLAP75 preparations gave the same results in all the biochemical analyses. For protein-protein interaction and functional studies, we expressed and purified the human BLM, Topo IIIα, and WRN proteins and also obtained the E. coli RecQ protein from the Kowalczykowski group; the SDS-PAGE analysis of these protein factors is shown in Fig. 1D.FIGURE 1Expression and purification of BLAP75. A, extracts from E. coli cells harboring pGEX-BLAP75-(His)6 grown with or without IPTG were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or immunoblotting with anti-GST antibodies. B, the procedure devised for the purification of BLAP75. C, purified BLAP75 (1 μg) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. D, purified BLM, Topo IIIα, E. coli RecQ, and WRN proteins, 1 μg each, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the hierarchy of protein-protein interactions within the BTB complex, we utilized the purified proteins in a series of pulldown experiments. Previous studies had reported an association of BLM with Topo IIIα by far Western analysis (7Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H. Riou J.F. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9636-9644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To confirm this interaction, we mixed purified BLM and Topo IIIα and then subjected the reaction mixture to immunoprecipitation with anti-BLM antibodies. As control, Topo IIIα alone was subjected to the same immunoprecipitation treatment. As shown in Fig. 2A, Topo IIIα was efficiently co-precipitated by BLM (lane 6), demonstrating a direct interaction between these two proteins. Next, to determine whether BLAP75 physically interacts with BLM, GST-BLAP75 or GST was incubated with BLM, followed by treatment of the reaction mixtures with glutathione-Sepharose beads to capture any protein complex that might have formed. Fig. 2B shows efficient retention of BLM on the glutathione-Sepharose beads with GST-BLAP75 but not GST alone, thus revealing a BLM-BLAP75 complex. The BLM-BLAP75 interaction is specific, as GST-BLAP75 did not bind the related E. coli RecQ or human WRN protein (Fig. 2D). We next enquired whether BLAP75 also associates with Topo IIIα. For this experiment, we performed GST-mediated pull-down with purified (His)6-tagged Topo IIIα and a form of GST-BLAP75 that lacks the (His)6 tag. Because the GST-BLAP75 and (His)6-tagged Topo IIIα have the same gel mobility, the latter was visualized by immunoblotting with anti-histidine antibodies. The results revealed that BLAP75 binds Topo IIIα with avidity (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2BLAP75 physically interacts with BLM and Topo IIIα. A, purified BLM was incubated with purified Topo IIIα, and the reaction mixture was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-BLM antibodies. The reaction supernatant (S), wash (W), and eluate (E) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. B and C, GST-BLAP75 or GST alone was incubated with BLM (in B) or Topo IIIα (in C). Protein complexes were captured on glutathione-Sepharose beads, followed by SDS-PAGE (in B) or immunoblotting with anti-histidine antibodies (in C). D, GST-BLAP75 or GST alone was incubated with WRN or E. coli RecQ, followed by mixing with glutathione-Sepharose beads to capture any protein complex that might have formed. Analysis was by SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)During HR, a DNA intermediate harboring two Holliday junctions is generated, and the resolution of this intermediate by a specialized nuclease called “resolvase” yields a mixture of crossover and non-crossover recombinants (8Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66 (and table of contents): 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). In mitotic cells, the formation of crossovers is specifically suppressed in a BLM-dependent manner (9Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that BLM in conjunction with Topo IIIα can catalyze the dissolution of a DHJ that mimics the HR intermediate with two Holliday junctions to generate exclusively non-crossover recombinants (1Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Given that BLAP75 binds BLM and Topo IIIα (Fig. 2), we surmised that BLAP75 may influence DHJ dissolution by BLM-Topo IIIα. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a DHJ substrate by annealing and ligating two oligonucleotides (32P-labeled B1 and unlabeled R1) according to published procedures (1Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 6Fu T.J. Tse-Dinh Y.C. Seeman N.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, BLAP75 greatly stimulated DHJ dissolution by BLM and Topo IIIα. Specifically, while the combination of BLM and Topo IIIα was able to dissolve about 10% of the DHJ substrate, the inclusion of BLAP75 led to >80% dissolution. Moreover, this effect became even more pronounced (20–40-fold stimulation by BLAP75) upon inclusion of a physiological level of salt in the reaction (Fig. 3B). We have verified that neither E. coli RecQ nor human WRN protein is capable of DHJ dissolution with or without BLAP75 and Topo IIIα (Fig. 3C).Published results (1Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) have shown that DHJ dissolution by BLM and Topo IIIα leads to the formation of non-crossover products. We used a biotinylated version of the R1 oligonucleotide for constructing the DHJ substrate and the analytical procedures developed by Wu and Hickson (1Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) to test whether the BTB complex likewise generates non-crossover recombinants (Fig. 4, A–C). Briefly, DHJ dissolution in the non-crossover manner would untangle the 32P-labeled B1 oligonucleotide and the biotinylated R1 oligonucleotide, such that treatment with magnetic streptavidin beads would deplete the DHJ substrate but not the radiolabeled product (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows that the radiolabeled product made by the BTB complex was not depleted by treatment with streptavidin magnetic beads, indicating that it was free 32P-labeled B1 oligonucleotide formed via a non-crossover mode of DHJ dissolution. We also employed restriction analysis to further verify the non-crossover configuration of the DHJ dissolution products. The radiolabeled product was susceptible to the restriction enzyme HhaI but resistant to RsaI (Fig. 4C), again indicative of a non-crossover mode of DHJ dissolution by the BTB complex (see Fig. 4A for explanation). Just as what was previously reported for the combination of BLM and Topo IIIα (1Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), the DHJ dissolution activity of the BTB complex requires ATP hydrolysis by the BLM protein, as no product was observed upon substitution of ATP with the non-hydrolyzable (or slowly hydrolyzable) analogue AMP-PNP or ATPγS (data not shown).FIGURE 4Non-crossover products are formed by the BTB complex. A, a biotinylated DHJ substrate was used to test whether the products of BTB-mediated dissolution have a non-crossover configuration. B, streptavidin magnetic beads depleted the DHJ substrate (lanes 1 and 2) but not the dissolution product (lanes 3 and 4). When unreacted DHJ was mixed with the dissolution product, only the former was depleted by the streptavidin magnetic beads (lanes 5 and 6). C, radiolabeled dissolution product (lane 2) was digested by HhaI (lane 3) but was resistant to RsaI (lane 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Even though homologous recombination is an important DNA repair tool and helps prevent DNA replication fork demise (8Symington L.S.

A. 2004; 101: 12783-12788Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), aberrant or untimely HR events can have deleterious effects (11Gangloff S. Soustelle C. Fabre F. Nat.

Deregulated HR, manifested as greatly elevated levels of sister chromatid exchanges and interhomologue crossover recombination, is likely responsible for the frequent genomic rearrangements and loss of heterozygosity in BLM-deficient cells (1Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 9Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). This compromised genomic integrity is believed to be the cause of early onset cancers in BS patients (1Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 9Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Recent studies have found additional protein factors potentially required for BLM protein activities (2Meetei A.R. Sechi S. Wallisch M. Yang D. Young M.K. Joenje H. Hoatlin M.E. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3417-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 3Yin J. Sobeck A. Xu C. Meetei A.R. Hoatlin M. Li L. Wang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Here we have provided evidence that the BLM-associated polypeptide, BLAP75, binds BLM and Topo IIIα to assemble the BTB complex. Since under physiological conditions DHJ dissolution by BLM-Topo IIIα becomes completely dependent on BLAP75, aside from being important for the stability of BLM and Topo IIIα (3Yin J. Sobeck A. Xu C. Meetei A.R. Hoatlin M. Li L. Wang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), this novel polypeptide also plays an important functional role in the processing of HR intermediates to limit DNA crossover formation in cells.Overall, our biochemical analyses with highly purified protein factors have unveiled a novel DHJ dissolvasome complex that controls a major pathway of HR regulation and genome maintenance, and they also provide important insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of this complex. The diverse nature of components in higher order ensembles that harbor the BTB dissolvasome (3Yin J. Sobeck A. Xu C. Meetei A.R. Hoatlin M. Li L. Wang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) alludes to the intricate mechanisms involved in HR regulation and related processes. For instance, association of the BTB complex with components of the Fanconi anemia protein complex (2Meetei A.R. Sechi S. Wallisch M. Yang D. Young M.K. Joenje H. Hoatlin M.E. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3417-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 13Pichierri P. Franchitto A. Rosselli F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3154-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) may link the BTB-mediated HR regulatory mechanism to the elimination of DNA cross-links via HR (14Kennedy R.D. D'Andrea A.D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2925-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Delineating the settings in which the BTB dissolvasome complex functions will be of great importance in enhancing our understanding of the significance of HR regulation in ensuring the fidelity of DNA repair reactions and in cancer avoidance. Our definition of the functional attributes of the BTB complex and the contributions of the individual components of this complex represents an important step toward this goal. Cells from Bloom syndrome (BS) 3The abbreviations used are: BS, Bloom syndrome; Topo, topoisomerase; HR, homologous recombination; DHJ, double Holliday junction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). 3The abbreviations used are: BS, Bloom syndrome; Topo, topoisomerase; HR, homologous recombination; DHJ, double Holliday junction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). patients exhibit highly elevated levels of sister chromatid exchanges, indicative of an impairment of the ability to regulate crossover recombination. Consistent with this characteristic, BLM, the RecQ-like helicase mutated in BS, has been found to cooperate with the type IA topoisomerase Topo IIIα to resolve the homologous recombination (HR) intermediate that harbors a double Holliday junction (DHJ) into non-crossover recombinants. This DHJ dissolution activity of the BLM-Topo IIIα complex is thought to be critical for the suppression of DNA crossover formation in mitotic cells and cancer avoidance in humans (1Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). BLAP75 (BLM-Associated Polypeptide, 75 kDa) was first identified by Meetei et al. (2Meetei A.R. Sechi S. Wallisch M. Yang D. Young M.K. Joenje H. Hoatlin M.E. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3417-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) as a component of several BLM-containing complexes immunoprecipitable from HeLa nuclear extracts. In a subsequent study, it was shown that small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of BLAP75 causes a decrease in BLM and Topo IIIα protein levels in cells (3Yin J. Sobeck A. Xu C. Meetei A.R. Hoatlin M. Li L. Wang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Importantly, BLAP75 depletion phenocopies the increased frequency of sister chromatid exchanges characteristic of BLM-deficient cells (3Yin J. Sobeck A. Xu C. Meetei A.R. Hoatlin M. Li L. Wang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Taken together, the available evidence indicates that BLAP75 exists as a complex with BLM and Topo IIIα (henceforth referred to as the BTB complex), but the mechanistic details of this relationship remain elusive. For instance, whether BLAP75 associates directly with BLM, or through Topo IIIα, is unknown. More importantly, it is not clear whether BLAP75 influences the DHJ dissolution activity of BLM-Topo IIIα or, as suggested previously (3Yin J. Sobeck A. Xu C. Meetei A.R. Hoatlin M. Li L. Wang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), serves as a structural component to promote protein complex formation. In this study, we have carried out biochemical analyses to define the role of the BTB complex in DHJ dissolution.

Passage of metabolites through the OMM has been attributed to the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC), which can form a large conductance and permanently open a channel in lipid bilayers. However, recent data indicate that the transport of metabolites through the OMM is controlled in the cells. Recognizing that the bilayer studies had been commonly conducted at supraphysiological [Ca2+] and [K+], we determined the effect of Ca2+ on VDAC activity. In liposomes, the purified VDAC displays Ca2+-dependent control of the molecular cut-off size and shows Ca2+-regulated Ca2+ permeability in the physiological [Ca2+] range. In bilayer experiments, at submicromolar [Ca2+], the purified VDAC or isolated OMM does not show sustained large conductance but rather exhibits gating between a nonconducting state and various subconductance states. Ca2+ addition causes a reversible increase in the conductance and may evoke channel opening to full conductance. Furthermore, single cell imaging data indicate that Ca2+ may facilitate the cation and ATP transport across the OMM. Thus, the VDAC gating is dependent on the physiological concentrations of cations, allowing the OMM to control the passage of ions and some small molecules. The OMM barrier is likely to decrease during the calcium signal. Cell function depends on the distribution of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors across the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM).

The voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC)/mitochondrial porin is the most abundant protein of the OMM. When reconstituted in artificial membrane systems, such as liposomes and planar bilayer membranes (black lipid membrane (BLM)), the VDAC commonly appears as a large channel. At low potentials (<30 mV), the VDAC was found to be mostly fully open (∼4.5-nanosiemens conductance in 1 m KCl) and weakly anion-selective, whereas at high potentials, the VDAC showed a switch to cationic selectivity and closed to approximately half of the original conductance (classical “closed” states) (10Colombini M.

Since the molecular cut-off of the VDAC is >3,000 Da in the fully open state, the common belief was that the OMM is freely permeable to small molecules and ions. However, during the past decade, several lines of evidence raised questions about the large size pore-forming activity of the VDAC in natural membranes and the consequent high permeability of the OMM (14Lemasters J.J. Holmuhamedov E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1762: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Patch clamp measurements of OMM fractions and intracellular patch clamping of native mitochondria did not show high conductance channel activity (15Kinnally K.W. Tedeschi H. Mannella C.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 226: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Moran O. Sciancalepore M. Sandri G. Panfili E. Bassi R. Ballarin C. Sorgato M.C. Eur. Biophys. J. 1992; 20: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) unless ionic strength or [Ca2+] was elevated to supraphysiological levels (17Jonas E.A. Buchanan J. Kaczmarek L.K. Science. 1999; 286: 1347-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Within a cell, the OMM may form a barrier against the transport of some small molecules (e.g. ADP (18Saks V.A. Vasil'eva E.

Rigoulet M. Leverve X.M. Saks V.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, in certain apoptosis models, the OMM permeability has been shown to be restricted for metabolites (20Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 159-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Recently, selective permeabilization of the OMM by tBid, a proapoptotic protein (21Csordas G. Madesh M. Antonsson B. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2198-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and by overexpression of VDAC (22Rapizzi E. Pinton P. Szabadkai G. Wieckowski M.R. Vandecasteele G. Baird G. Tuft R.A. Fogarty K.E. Rizzuto R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) was reported to enhance the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced mitochondrial matrix [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]m) signal. These results suggested that the OMM Ca2+ permeability could limit rapid Ca2+ uptake to the mitochondria during physiological calcium signals. Furthermore, using targeted enhanced yellow fluorescence protein, lower pH was recorded in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) than that in the cytosol (23Porcelli A.M. Ghelli A. Zanna C. Pinton P. Rizzuto R. Rugolo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the VDAC did not permit rapid equilibration of the protons across the OMM. To understand the reason for the apparent discrepancy between reconstituted and nonreconstituted data, we focused our interest on the experimental parameters of the reconstituted systems. We recognized that in the liposome and BLM experiments, typically supraphysiological [Ca2+] were used (0.1-5 mm [Ca2+] in BLM experiments and unbuffered or poorly buffered calcium in liposome experiments), presumably to increase membrane stability. Also, the bilayers were regularly bathed in a 1 m salt solution (e.g. KCl). To establish the VDAC behavior in the presence of physiological (submicromolar) and elevated [Ca2+] as well, we set up both liposomal transport and BLM experiments with purified VDAC and OMM and fluorescence imaging of mitochondrial ion transport in single cells. Isolation and Quality Control of VDAC and OMM from Rat Liver— Mitochondria isolated from rat liver were used for purification of VDAC as previously described (24Bathori G. Sahin-Toth M. Fonyo A. Ligeti E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1145: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For the isolation of OMM, mitochondria were further purified using self-performing Percoll gradient centrifugation (30% Percoll in 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, and 2.5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4). After a washing step, the pellet was resuspended and incubated in hyposmotic potassium phosphate buffer (swelling medium, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) for 30 min on ice. Subsequently, a shrinking medium (32% sucrose, 30% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2) was added to the suspension (33% volume). After 30 min of shrinking, the mitochondrial membranes were disrupted by ultrasonication (4 × 1 min of irradiation, 1-min break between each run). The resulted material was spun down at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant contains a mixture of mitochondrial membrane vesicles and was used as a reference for the further purified membranes (marked as Mito in Fig. 1). To separate the OMM, contact point (CP), and IMM fractions, a discontinuous sucrose gradient was used (from bottom to top, 70, 45.6, 34.2, and 26% sucrose steps, 200,000 × g for 240 min). The OMM was concentrated in the interface between the 26 and 34.2% steps, the CP was collected between 34.2 and 45.6%, and the IMM was collected between 45.6 and 70%. The protein concentration was determined in each fraction. To evaluate the purity of the isolated VDAC and mitochondrial membrane fractions, SDS-PAGE was performed, and the proteins were visualized with either silver staining or Western blotting (antibodies from the following sources: VDAC (Affinity Bioreagents); Bcl-xL (Transduction Laboratories), and Bax (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.)). The membrane fractions were also tested for monoaminooxidase and succinate dehydrogenase enzyme activity, which were used as an OMM and an IMM marker, respectively. Measurement of Dye Release and Ca2+ Uptake by Plain and VDAC-reconstituted Liposomes—Soy lecithin (l-α-phosphatidylcholine (Soy 20%) from Avanti Polar Lipids or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine from Sigma) was washed with 10 mm EGTA to remove Ca2+ contamination and was recrystallized. Liposomes were prepared by sonicating 50 mg/ml recrystallized lipid in a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.2, 325 μm EGTA, and 5 mg/ml dextran. After sonication, incorporation of purified VDAC and loading with fura2FA (50 μm) or with 10-kDa fura-dextran (250 μg/ml) was carried out by subjecting these vesicles to three freeze-thaw cycles. The liposomes were washed three times and were used promptly after the last washing step. Dye release experiments were carried out essentially as described previously (25Madesh M. Hajnoczky G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30-μl aliquots of the plain and VDAC-reconstituted liposomes were added to 720-μl aliquots of 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.2, and EGTA 325 μm supplemented with various amounts of CaCl2 to set different [Ca2+]. After incubation for 0, 5, or 10 min at room temperature, the liposome suspensions were centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the fura fluorescence released to the supernatant and the residual liposomal fraction in the solubilized pellet (Triton 0.3%) was measured (excitation, 340 nm; emission, 500 nm). The concentration of CaCl2 was increased to 2 mm in every sample before the fluorescence measurement. For the Ca2+ transport measurements, the fura-dextran-loaded, VDAC-reconstituted, or plain liposomes were resuspended in a fluorometer cuvette in a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.2, and 325 μm EGTA at room temperature. To attain various [Ca2+] levels, CaCl2 (100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 μm) was added. The time course of the fura fluorescence was monitored in a PTI DeltaRam fluorometer (excitation, 340 and 380 nm; emission, 500 nm). At the end of the measurement, to permeabilize every liposome for Ca2+, ionomycin (5 μm), a Ca2+ ionophore, was applied. Calibration of the fura ratio in terms of nm [Ca2+] was added carried out as described previously (26Csordas G. Hajnoczky G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For calculation of the initial rate of the VDAC-mediated Ca2+ entry, first a curve was fitted to the time course of the intraliposomal [Ca2+]in each condition. The nonreconstituted background displayed a quasilinear kinetics, whereas the VDAC-reconstituted samples gave an excellent fit with the combination of an exponential and a linear component (y = y0 + a × (1 - e-b(x -c)) + d × (x - c)). The derivation of the exponential tag on x = c gives the initial rate that is equal to a × b. Planar Lipid Bilayer Experiments—Purified asolectin (freshly recrystallized from stock purchased from Sigma or Avanti Polar) bilayers were prepared by painting a decane solution across a hole of a delrin cup (Warner Instruments). The experimental medium contained 0.1 m KCl or 1 m KCl plus 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. The preparation and storage of the medium was carefully controlled to minimize the risk of Ca2+ contamination. Under these conditions, the [Ca2+] was 500-600 nm. In order to exclude Ca2+ contamination, at the end of several experiments, the content of the cup was transferred to a fluorometer cuvette, and the [Ca2+] was evaluated by fura2 (0.25 μm) fluorescence measurement. The bilayer was painted, applying a drop of lipid to the hole by the means of a Teflon rod. After a stable membrane appeared (around 80 picofarads) and was recorded for 5 min, isolated VDAC or OMM vesicles were added to the cis partition. The additions of 0.5-6 μl of solubilized VDAC protein (VDAC-prep) or OMM vesicles (OMM-prep) were made in the vicinity of the membrane. The content of the partitions was stirred by magnetic bars. Usually, the channel activity appeared within 10 min. If not, the addition of VDAC-prep was repeated. The total amount of added protein was 0.3-25 ng. In a few cases when the VDAC-prep was added only once, single channel activity appeared. The experiments were carried out at room temperature (22-24 °C). The cis and trans sides were coupled to electrodes via agar bridges. The electrodes were connected to CV203B headstage (Axon Instruments). For data acquisition, an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments) amplifier was used. The output signal of the amplifier was digitized by a Digidata 1200 digitizer. The headstage and chamber were placed in a small aluminum box (Faraday cage) that was closed during the measurements. The box was grounded to the headstage, as is recommended by the Axon Instruments. Noise level was monitored at the readout of the patch amplifier. The activity was monitored and recorded by means of an IBM-compatible PC. The amplifier was used in patch mode. A data point was obtained in every 60 μs (the high rate was needed to detect the flickering bursts). Current recordings were filtered by a built-in low pass, 4-pole Bessel filter of the amplifier (2 or 5 kHz). In some cases, the signal was also digitally filtered (described in legend to Fig. 4). The signal was also collected essentially unfiltered for data analysis. When an ion channel appeared, first, it was recorded for 10-30 s at various voltages, and then it was recorded for at least 5 min at -20 or +20 mV. CaCl2 (100 μm) and EGTA/Tris (200 or 400 μm, pH 7.4) were added to both sides of the membrane. After stirring, the recording was continued for at least 5 min. For the online recording and offline analysis of traces, the PCLAMP 9.0 program package (Axon Instruments) was used. Imaging Experiments—RBL-2H3 mucosal mast cells were cultured and plated for experiments as previously described (27Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Cells (4.5 × 106 in 250 μl) were transfected with plasmid DNA in suspension using electroporation (cytochrome c-GFP (cyto c-GFP) (28Heiskanen K.M. Bhat M.B. Wang H.W. Ma J. Nieminen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5654-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and mitochondrial matrix-targeted DS Red (mito-DS Red); Clontech), keeping total DNA at 30 μg, and then were plated to coverslips. Imaging was carried out 24-36 h after transfection. For imaging of [Ca2+]m, the cells were loaded with fura2FF/AM (5 μm) for 50-60 min at 37 °C in extracellular medium composed of 121 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3,10mm Na-HEPES, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, in the presence of 0.003% pluronic acid. After dye-loading, the cells were rinsed with Ca2+-free extracellular buffer containing 100 μm EGTA. Permeabilization was carried out in 1 ml of ICM (120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4,20mm Tris-HEPES, and 1 μg/ml each antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin at pH 7.2) supplemented with saponin (30-50 μg/ml) and 20 μm EGTA/Tris in the incubation chamber for 5 min (35 °C). Subsequently, cells were put to fresh ICM containing 10 μm EGTA/Tris. Confocal imaging of cyto c-GFP and mito-DS Red was conducted using a Bio-Rad Radiance system, whereas fluorescence imaging of pHIMS and [Ca2+]m was carried out using an excitation wavelength switch (DG4; Sutter) and a high quantum efficiency cooled CCD camera (Pluto; Pixelvision) fitted to an Olympus IX70 microscope. At confocal imaging, cyto c-GFP and mito-DS Red were excited using the 488- and 568-nm lines of a krypton/argon ion laser source, respectively, recording 512 × 512-pixel image pairs at 0.3 s-1. At the fluorescence imaging experiments, cyto c-GFP was excited at 480 nm, and fura2FF was excited at 340 and 380 nm, and images or image pairs were recorded at 1 s-1. Image analysis was performed using custom-made software (26Csordas G. Hajnoczky G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fluorescence (averaged from pixels covering whole cell areas) was determined separately for each single cell (35-50 cells/field) on the field. [Ca2+] Used in the Different Experiments—In the beginning of the transport assays, the liposomes (Figs. 2 and 3) and permeabilized cells (Fig. 7) were exposed to [Ca2+] of <20 nm. By means of CaCl2 addition, [Ca2+] was increased to various levels up to ∼1.5 mm. Thus, initially, the [Ca2+] was maintained slightly lower than the physiological [Ca2+]c (<100 nm), and the increase in [Ca2+] included the range of both the global [Ca2+]c signals (<2 μm) and the peak [Ca2+]c attained only in the vicinity of open Ca2+ release or entry channels (up to several hundred μm). For the sake of membrane stability, the bilayers were formed and recorded at ∼600 nm [Ca2+] (Figs. 4B, 5, 6), and to study the effect of Ca2+, the [Ca2+] was increased to ∼50 or 100 μm. [Ca2+] in the buffers was calculated using WINMAX software (Stanford University, CA) and was determined regularly by fluorometric [Ca2+] measurements.FIGURE 3Ca2+-dependent Ca2+ influx into VDAC-liposomes. Liposomes were loaded with 10 kDa of fura-dextran and, after washing, were incubated in a Ca2+-free buffer in a fluorometer cuvette. The entry of Ca2+ was initiated by the addition of CaCl2 where it is indicated by the arrows. Both reconstituted (VDAC) and control liposomes (plain) were monitored. Intraliposomal [Ca2+] was calculated from the fura excitation ratio. The calcium dependence was established through the calculation of initial rates at various external [Ca2+]. A and B, exemplified influx curves of reconstituted (upper curve) and nonreconstituted liposomes (lower curve). C, calcium dependence of the initial rate.

Significance of differences from the relevant controls was calculated by Student's t test. Characterization of Isolated VDAC and OMM—To study VDAC activity, both VDAC-prep and OMM-prep were isolated from rat liver mitochondria (Fig. 1). The procedure of the isolation of the OMM also yielded IMM and CP vesicles. Silver staining revealed a single band at ∼32 kDa in the VDAC-prep, whereas among several bands, the dominant one was also the 32-kDa band in the OMM-prep (Fig. 1A, top). The enrichment of the 32-kDa band in the OMM-prep was apparent when compared with the mitochondrial homogenate (Mito), IMM, and CP fractions (Fig. 1A, top). Immunostaining with an anti-VDAC antibody showed intense reaction with the 32-kDa band in the VDAC-prep and also in the submitochondrial membrane fractions (Fig. 1A, middle). The OMM-prep displayed robust immunoreactivity relative to the mitochondrial homogenate, IMM, or CP fractions (Fig. 1A, middle). Several Bcl-2 family proteins reside in the mitochondrial membranes to control the OMM permeabilization. Bcl-xL, an antiapopototic Bcl-2 family protein, was present in the homogenate but was not detectable in the VDAC-prep (Fig. 1A, bottom). By contrast, the OMM-prep was enriched in Bcl-xL (Fig. 1A, bottom). Similar to the Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bax were also undetectable in the VDAC-prep and abundant in the OMM-prep (data not shown). The activity of the monoaminooxidase (MAO), which is frequently used as an OMM marker enzyme, showed a 15-20-fold enrichment in the OMM-prep (Fig. 1B, gray columns), whereas succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), an IMM enzyme, was present in the IMM fraction but was hardly detectable in the OMM-prep (Fig. 1B, open columns). Collectively, these data suggest that the only major protein in the VDAC-prep is VDAC and that the OMM-prep is highly enriched in VDAC. The OMM-prep has little contamination with IMM components but contains OMM proteins, including several Bcl-2 family proteins. When the VDAC-prep was reconstituted into asolecithin liposomes that were incubated in the presence of 100 mm KCl and 100 μm CaCl2, the liposomes became permeable for fura2, a 0.8-kDa fluorescent probe (Fig. 1C). However, larger molecules, such as fura2 conjugated to 10-kDa dextran (fura-dextran; Fig. 1C) or fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated with cytochrome c (14 kDa) was not released (25Madesh M. Hajnoczky G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the VDAC-prep inserted into the liposome membrane and in the presence of 100 μm CaCl2, formed pores that allowed for the transport of small molecules. Ca2+ Dependence of the Permeability of Liposomes Reconstituted with VDAC—To determine whether Ca2+ exerts any effects on the VDAC-mediated transport of small molecules, the fura2 release from plain and VDAC-prep-reconstituted liposomes (VDAC-liposomes) was evaluated at varying Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 2). The liposomes were exposed to <20 nm, 2-3 μm, and >1mm [Ca2+], respectively, and were incubated for 0 or 5 min at room temperature. Measurement of t"

Here we report the formation of a toxic Aβ-Cu2+ complex formed via a histidine-bridged dimer, as observed at Cu2+/peptide ratios of >0.6:1 by EPR spectroscopy. The toxicity of the Aβ-Cu2+ complex to cultured primary cortical neurons was attenuated when either the π -or τ-nitrogen of the imidazole side chains of His were methylated, thereby inhibiting formation of the His bridge. Toxicity did not correlate with the ability to form amyloid or perturb the acyl-chain region of a lipid membrane as measured by diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene anisotropy, but did correlate with lipid peroxidation and dityrosine formation. 31P magic angle spinning solid-state NMR showed that Aβ and Aβ-Cu2+ complexes interacted at the surface of a lipid membrane. These findings indicate that the generation of the Aβ toxic species is modulated by the Cu2+ concentration and the ability to form an intermolecular His bridge.

Transition metals, such as copper (Cu2+), zinc (Zn2+), and iron (Fe3+), are enriched in Aβ plaques (1Bush A.I. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), and the Aβ peptide possesses both high and low affinity Cu2+ and Zn2+ binding sites in vitro. These interactions with Cu2+, Zn2+, and to a lesser extent Fe3+ have been reported to control the aggregation state of Aβ. Moreover, the Aβ-Cu2+ complexes are redoxactive, suggesting that the oxidative stress observed in AD patients is related to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by metal-bound forms of Aβ and may be central to the pathological mechanism of AD (reviewed by Bush (1Bush A.I. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar)). The coordination environment of Cu2+ bound to Aβ has been studied by EPR, Raman, and NMR spectroscopies. The consensus is that the coordination of Cu2+ to Aβ is via the three His residues His6, His13, and His14 and an as yet undefined fourth ligand; options put forward include tyrosine (Tyr10) (2Curtain C.C.

Recently, Glu11 has been identified as providing the carboxylate side chain when Zn2+ is bound to Aβ 1–16 (10Zirah S. Kozin S.A. Mazur A. Blond A. Cheminant M. Segalas-Milazzo I. Debey P. Rebuffat S.

At Cu2+/peptide molar ratios greater than 0.6:1, a distinctive broad resonance developed near g ∼ 2. This broad resonance was attributed to exchange interactions between two Cu2+ ions ∼6 Ä apart, with the second Cu2+ ion being coordinated to Aβ in a cooperative manner via a His bridge (Fig. 1b), similar to that observed by Ohtsu et al. (11Ohtsu H. Shimazaki Y. Odani A. Yamauchi O. Mori W. Itoh S. Fukuzumi S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 5733-5741Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar) for Cu2+ bridge imidizolate complexes. Here we report the first observation of resonances at g ∼ 4 in the EPR spectra of Aβ-Cu2+ peptides, where the broad g ∼ 2 line is also observed. Such EPR spectra are diagnostic for the existence of binuclear Cu2+ centers where the Cu2+ ions are coupled by dipolar interactions; simulations presented here demonstrate that these atoms are 6.2 ± 0.2 Ä apart (12Smith T.D. Pilbrow J.R. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1974; 13: 173-278Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar). This distance is consistent with a His bridge between the Cu2+ atoms. To further the understanding of the role played by the His bridge and Aβ-lipid interactions in the neurotoxicity of Aβ, we examine the toxic mechanism of both metal-free and Cu2+-bound forms of the Aβ peptide. The link between His bridge formation and neurotoxicity was explored through experiments using Aβ 1-42 peptides modified by the methylation of the His residues at either the π- or τ-nitrogen of the imidazole side chain (Fig. 1c). Correspondingly modified Aβ 1-40 has been shown to be nontoxic, despite being redox-active in a manner similar to the wild type (WT) peptide (4Tickler A. Smith D. Ciccotosto G. Tew D. Curtain C.C.

This lack of toxicity has been attributed to these peptides being unable to bind to cell surface membranes, congruent with the notion that Aβ-lipid membrane interactions are central to the cause of neurotoxicity in AD (13Eckert G.P. Wood W.G. Muller W.E. Subcell. Biochem. 2005; 38: 319-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kagan B.L. Hirakura Y. Azimov R. Azimova R. Lin M.C.

Here we describe the Cu2+ coordination, lipid interactions, and aggregation properties of both the neurotoxic WT Aβ 1-42 peptide and Aβ 1-42 where the His residues have been methylated at either the π- or τ-nitrogen of the imidazole side chain. The Cu2+-bound WT Aβ 1-42 peptide was shown to be significantly more toxic, as monitored by the viability of primary cortical neurons, under conditions in which the His bridge was formed. Perturbation of this metal coordination mode leads to a loss in toxicity even in the presence of Cu2+. We also show that toxicity correlates with the ability of the peptides to form dityrosine and induce lipid peroxidation. Toxicity displays a negative correlation with the formation of amyloid material and the ability to perturb the acyl-chain region of lipid bilayer. These results show that the ability to form aCu2+-linked His bridge dimer, resulting ultimately in lipid peroxidation, is central to the metal-meditated toxicity of Aβ. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Peptide Synthesis—The uncommon Nim-protected amino acids, Fmoc-l-His(N-1-Me)-OH (His-π-Me) and Fmoc-l-His(N-3-Me)-OH (His-τ-Me), were purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland); all were used without further purification. All modified peptides were synthesized according to methods outlined previously (18Tickler A.K. Barrow C.J. Wade J.D. J. Pept. Sci. 2001; 7: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Due to the large degree of similarity between the peptides, large batches of resins were prepared and split at appropriate points in the synthetic pathway such that each peptide was prepared on a scale of 0.03 mmol. WT Aβ 1-42 was purchased from the W. M. Keck Laboratory (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Peptide and Aggregate Preparation—PBS is defined as 10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl at pH 7.4. Cu2+ was present as a solution of 1 part CuCl2 to 6 parts glycine. The addition of a glycine counterion was essential in order to prevent the formation of insoluble phosphate-metal complexes. A 25 mm stock solution was made and diluted in deionized water to the desired concentration as required. Peptide working solutions were prepared by taking a known amount of Aβ 1-42 and then dissolving it in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-isopropanol (HFIP). The peptide was incubated at 25 °C for 1 h to remove any preformed structure. Known amounts of peptide were then aliquoted out, and HFIP was removed by evaporation. The resulting peptide film was stored at –80 °C until required. The film was dissolved in 20 mm NaOH and then diluted out in deionized water and 10× PBS at a v/v/v ratio of 2:7:1. All solutions were sonicated in a water bath for 10 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at high speed before the addition of 10× PBS. The supernatant was kept on ice for immediate use. The absorbance value at 214 nm was measured, and the concentration of the peptides was determined using a molar extinction coefficient value of 75,887 liters/mol/cm, adjusting to the required concentration with buffer A. CuCl2/Gly was added to the required concentration from a 25 mm stock. Samples were used immediately or incubated at 37 °C with agitation at 200 rpm for either 2 or 24 h. EPR Spectroscopy—Continuous wave EPR spectra were obtained with Bruker ESP380E FT/CW and ECS106 X-band spectrometers. Temperatures around 120 K in both were achieved with a Bruker nitrogen gas flow insert in the standard rectangular TE012 cavity. Spectra acquired at 2.5 K using the ESP380E were achieved using an Oxford Instruments CF935 cryostat with an ER4118 cylindrical cavity insert. The microwave frequency was measured with an EIP microwave 548A frequency counter, and the g factors were determined with reference to the F+ line in CaO (19Wertz J.E. Orton J.W. Auzins P. Discuss. Faraday Soc. 1961; 31: 140-150Crossref Google Scholar). Spectrum simulations were performed with the SOPHE software (version 1.1.4) described by Hanson et al. (20Hanson G.R. Gates K.E. Noble C.J. Griffin M. Mitchell A. Benson S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 903-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). For the EPR measurements, the chloride of 99.99% pure 65Cu (Cambridge Isotopes) was used. The peptides were dissolved from an HFIP-treated stock to 100 μm in deionized water, and 65CuCl2 to the desired Cu2+/peptide molar ratio was added immediately from a 2.0 mm stock solution via a glass microsyringe. The pH was then adjusted to 7.4 by adding concentrated PBS or ethylmorpholine buffer, and after mixing, samples were rapidly transferred to Wilmad “Suprasil” EPR tubes and frozen immediately. Before and after the EPR spectroscopy, metal concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and peptide concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. High Performance Immobilized Metal Ion Chromatography—All solutions were delivered to the column at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The high performance immobilized metal ion chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) was swollen in PBS (pH 7.4), washed in EDTA (50 mm) to remove trace metals, and then washed with deionized H2O. The column was charged with Cu2+ by injecting 2 ml of 0.1 m CuCl2/glycine(1:6). The excess metal was removed by washing the column with deionized H2O. The column was then re-equilibrated in PBS (15 ml). The peptides were prepared at 1 mm in 10% 2′,2′,2′-trifluoroethanol/PBS, and 5 μl was injected onto the column. The peptides were eluted using either a pH gradient (7.4–2.5) generated by a linear increase (0–100%) in PBS at pH 2.5 or an imidazole gradient (0–100% 500 mm imidazole in PBS at pH 7.4). Primary Neuronal Cultures—Cortical neuronal cultures were prepared as described previously (21Ciccotosto G.D. Tew D. Curtain C.C. Smith D. Carrington D. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Cherny R.A. Cappai R. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42528-42534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryonic day 14 BL6Jx129sv mouse cortices were removed, dissected free of meninges, and dissociated in 0.025% (w/v) trypsin in Krebs buffer. The dissociated cells were triturated using a filter-plugged fine pipette tip, pelleted, resuspended in plating medium (minimum Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum), and counted. Cortical neuronal cells were plated into poly(l-lysine)-coated 48-well plates at a density of 125,000 cells/well in plating medium. All cultures were maintained in an incubator set at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 2 h, the plating medium was replaced with fresh neurobasal medium containing B27 supplements, Geneticin, and 0.5 mm glutamine (all tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen unless otherwise stated). This method resulted in cultures highly enriched for neurons (>95% purity) with minimal astrocyte and microglial content as determined by immunostaining of culture preparations using specific marker antibodies. Cell Viability Assay—The neuronal cells were allowed to mature for 6 days in culture before commencing treatment using freshly prepared serum free neurobasal medium plus B27 supplements minus antioxidants. For the treatment of neuronal cultures, peptide was prepared at 50 μm at Cu2+/peptide molar ratios of 0:1, 0.1:1, 1:1, and 10:1 and used immediately. Peptides were diluted to the final concentration of 5 μm in neurobasal medium. The mixtures were then added to neuronal cells for 96 h. Cell survival was monitored by phase-contrast microscopy, and cell viability was quantitated using the MTS assay as described previously (21Ciccotosto G.D. Tew D. Curtain C.C. Smith D. Carrington D. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Cherny R.A. Cappai R. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42528-42534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, the medium was replaced with fresh neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 lacking antioxidants, and 10% (v/v) MTS (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well and incubated for 3 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Plates were gently shaken, and a 150-μl aliquot from each well was transferred to separate wells of a 96-well plate. The color change of each well was determined by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm using a Wallac Victor Multireader, and background readings of MTS incubated in cell-free medium were subtracted from each value before calculations. The data were normalized and calculated as a percentage of untreated vehicle control values. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons between groups were done using Student's t test. Quantification of Aggregate and Fibril Formation—For determination of fibril growth end points, a discontinuous assay of fibril growth was used. Peptide samples (20 μl) were removed from incubation after 2 or 24 h and added to 600 μl of a 20 μm thioflavin-T (ThT) solution at pH 7.4 in buffer A. The ThT signal was quantified by averaging the fluorescence emission at 480 nm over 10 s when excited at 444 nm using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55 fluorescence spectrophotometer, slit widths for excitation of 2.5 nm and emission of 12.5 nm at 37 °C. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—The peptides were prepared as described above diluting to a final concentration of 20 μm in PBS to achieve a measurable CD signal. Cu2+ was titrated into the peptide preparation at 0.5–2.5 peptide mol eq after diluting the peptide, gently mixed, and allowed to equilibrate for 15 min at room temperature. Far UV-CD spectra were collected between 200 and 250 nm at room temperature on a Jasco 810 spectrometer using a quartz cuvette with a 1-cm path length. Measurements were recorded at 50 nm/min with a bandwidth of 1 nm and a response time of 2 s, averaging 10 accumulation scans per measurement. The spectra were background-subtracted, smoothed using the Jasco software (version 32) FFT filter function, and converted to molar ellipticity. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Dityrosine Formation—Peptide was prepared at 10 μm in the presence of 250 μm H2O2 at Cu2+/peptide molar ratios of 1:1. After 24 h of incubation, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 μl of 12.5 mm EDTA (final concentration 250 μm). Dityrosine content was quantified using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 320 nm and scanning the emission wavelengths from 350 to 500 nm. Maximum light signal was observed and recorded at 418 nm (22Atwood C.S. Perry G. Zeng H. Kato Y. Jones W.D. Ling K.Q. Huang X. Moir R.D. Wang D. Sayre L.M. Smith M.A. Chen S.G. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 560-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Preparation of Large Unilamellar Vesicles—Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared by initially dissolving equal quantities of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine] (PS) (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.) in chloroform. The chloroform was evaporated off, and the lipids were resuspended in buffer A at ∼10 mm and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with agitation at 200 rpm in the presence of glass beads. The lipid mixture was subjected to five freeze-thaw cycles using liquid nitrogen and a 37 °C water bath. The sample was then passed through an extruder apparatus using a 100-nm filter, resulting in a uniform solution of LUVs with a mean diameter between 120 and 140 nm. Steady-state Polarization of DPH—Diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) was purchased from Molecular Probes. Briefly, DPH was dissolved at 10 mm in Me2SO and diluted to 16.6 μm in buffer A containing 416 μm LUVs. A 60-μl aliquot of this sample was mixed with 40 μl of Aβ 1-42 at 10 μm, giving final concentrations of 10 μm probe, 250 μm LUVs, and 4 μm peptide. Samples were then incubated at 37 °C with aggregation at 200 rpm for 20 min prior to reading. The dye was excited at 359 nm, and emission was recorded at 430 nm. Anisotropy was measured on a Varian Eclipses spectrophotometer using internal polarizers and calculated by the equation, r = (Ivv – G·Ivh)/(Ivv + 2G·Ivh), where Ivv and Ivh are the fluorescence intensities when the excitation and emission polarizers are set at v (vertical) and h (horizontal), respectively. The grating factor G = Ihv/Ihh. Solid-state NMR—Solid-state NMR experiments were conducted on a Varian Inova 300 spectrometer operating at a resonance frequency of 121.4 MHz for 31P. 31P spectra were acquired at 28 °C, using a Doty 5-mm double resonance NMR probe with a standard Hahn echo and proton decoupling. Pulse times used were π/2 = 5 μs pulse with a delay of 2 s under magic angle spinning of ∼5 kHz. Typically, 10,000 scans were acquired, and an exponential line broadening of 10 Hz was applied. Chemical shift was referenced using 80% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) as 0 ppm for 31P NMR experiments. Lipid Peroxidation—20 μm peptide was prepared as above at a Cu2+/peptide molar ratio of 0:1 or 1:1. Samples were incubated for 5 min before the addition to 50% PC, 50% PS LUVs and ascorbate. Samples contained a final concentration of 10 μm peptide, 1 mm LUV, and 10 μm ascorbate and were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with agitation at 200 rpm. CQ was prepared in 100% Me2SO and added to final concentrations of 2, 20, and 50 μm. The final Me2SO concentration was 1% in all cases. The level of lipid peroxidation was quantified via a lipid peroxidation colorimetric assay (Oxford Biomedical Research) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The His Bridge Dimer as Observed by EPR—Most of the experiments described below were performed at pH 7.4 in PBS solutions, because NaCl at a concentration of ∼0.15 m is part of the physiological milieu. Under these conditions of pH, peptide concentration, and buffer, the predominant species observed by EPR depended on the Cu2+/peptide molar ratio. The addition of 65CuCl2 to Aβ 1–16, Aβ 1–28, and WT Aβ 1-42 to give Cu2+/peptide molar ratios of 0–0.5:1 gave EPR signals analogous to that shown in Fig. 2a. These spectra are similar to those reported previously (2Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol.

A simulated spectrum using the spin-Hamiltonian parameters is given in supplemental Table 1. These parameters are typical for Cu2+ coordinated by 2N2O or 3N1O (23Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 691-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). At Cu2+/peptide molar ratios of above 0.5:1, a significantly different resonance developed in the g ∼ 2 region, as reported previously (2Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 13355-13363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and as shown in Fig. 2b. Concurrently, we demonstrate here for the first time that a resonance also develops at g ∼ 4 when very high spectrometer gains are used (Fig. 3). The parallel appearance of the g ∼ 2 and g ∼ 4 resonances is diagnostic for the existence of a binuclear Cu2+ center (i.e. a pair of Cu2+ ions coupled by exchange and/or dipolar interactions) (12Smith T.D. Pilbrow J.R. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1974; 13: 173-278Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Although the Cu2+ hyperfine structure is not well resolved, its presence is confirmation that the resonance at g ∼ 4 is due to a pair of Cu2+ ions and not to a nonspecific aggregate. At Cu2+/peptide molar ratios of ∼1:1 and greater, another broad resonance developed centered at g ∼ 2.14 (Fig. 2c). No resonance at g ∼ 4 appears to be associated with this new signal, which may be attributed to a number of Cu2+ ions within ∼10 Ä of each other but not structurally related. The broken line spectrum in Fig. 2c represents the simulation of an isotropic resonance at g ∼ 2.14, such as might arise from a number of Cu2+ ions within ∼10 Ä of each other without a specific geometrical relationship and where the anisotropic features are averaged by a combination of dipolar and weak exchange interactions. Spectra acquired at 2.5 K of Aβ 1–28 (Cu2+/peptide molar ratio 1:1) exhibited the same resonances as observed at 120 K at g ∼ 2 and g ∼ 4 but with 50 times the intensity, indicating that antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the Cu2+ ions of the dimer must be ≪10 cm–1. The dimer spectra did not exhibit microwave power saturation up to 25 milliwatts at 2.5 K, indicating the existence of spin-spin relaxation processes as expected for a coupled system. In contrast, the mononuclear spectra exhibited power saturation effects above ∼1 milliwatt at 2.5 K. To verify that the g ∼ 2 and g ∼ 4 spectra were not due to oxo- or phosphate-bridged binuclear Cu2+ centers or to adventitious Fe3+, control spectra were acquired at 120 K of 1.5 mm 65CuCl2 in PBS, of PBS alone, and of the peptide in PBS prior to the addition of 65CuCl2. At pH 7.4, no resonances were observed near either g ∼ 2 or g ∼ 4. As a comparison with WT Aβ 1-42, the spectra of Aβ 1-42 containing His-τ-Me or His-π-Me at positions 6, 13, and 14 were recorded over the range of Cu2+/peptide molar ratios 0.3–1:1. Only mononuclear spectra were observed, similar to those previously published by Tickler et al. (4Tickler A. Smith D. Ciccotosto G. Tew D. Curtain C.C. Carrington D. Masters C.L. Bush A.I.

There were no indications of the broad resonance at g ∼ 2 characteristic of the binuclear Cu2+ center or for resonances near g ∼ 4, even at spectrometer settings where the g ∼ 4 resonances were clearly observed in the unmodified peptides. Fig. 2d shows the mononuclear spectra obtained with WT Aβ 1-42 at a Cu2+/peptide molar ratio of 0.1:1 and the similarly mononuclear spectra of His-τ-Me obtained at a Cu2+/peptide molar ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 2e). High pressure immobilized affinity chromatography was employed to ascertain if the methylation of the imidazole side chains had a significant effect on the relative Cu2+ binding affinity compared with WT Aβ 1-42. The strength of peptide-metal ion interactions is usually assessed as a function of the pH required to elute the various peptides from a Cu2+-loaded immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography column. However, we were unable to elute any of the peptides from the Cu2+-charged immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography column at pH <2 or by using an imidazole gradient. The peptides could only be eluted by the addition of EDTA to the eluting buffer, indicating that all peptides had a very high affinity for Cu2+. The effect of buffer conditions on Aβ-Cu2+ coordination was investigated by acquiring spectra of Aβ 1–28 in pH 7.4 ethylmorpholine buffer over a range of Cu2+/peptide molar ratios, recreating the conditions of Syme et al. (7Syme C.D. Nadal R.C. Rigby S.E. Viles J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18169-18177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). At Cu2+/peptide molar ratios of 0.1:1 and 1:1, only mononuclear spectra where observed. Spectra in the g ∼ 2 region were identical to those reported at Cu2+/peptide ratios of ≤1:1 by Syme et al. (7Syme C.D. Nadal R.C. Rigby S.E. Viles J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18169-18177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The broad line near g ∼ 2 was not observed, even at Cu2+ concentrations and spectrometer settings that yielded these resonances in PBS. Therefore,"
https://openalex.org/W2079544576,"In plants, a proposed ascorbate (vitamin C) biosynthesis pathway occurs via GDP-d-mannose (GDP-d-Man), GDP-l-galactose (GDP-l-Gal), and l-galactose. However, the steps involved in the synthesis of l-Gal from GDP-l-Gal in planta are not fully characterized. Here we present evidence for an in vivo role for l-Gal-1-P phosphatase in plant ascorbate biosynthesis. We have characterized a low ascorbate mutant (vtc4-1) of Arabidopsis thaliana, which exhibits decreased ascorbate biosynthesis. Genetic mapping and sequencing of the VTC4 locus identified a mutation (P92L) in a gene with predicted l-Gal-1-P phosphatase activity (At3g02870). Pro-92 is within aβ-bulge that is conserved in related myo-inositol monophosphatases. The mutation is predicted to disrupt the positioning of catalytic amino acid residues within the active site. Accordingly, l-Gal-1-P phosphatase activity in vtc4-1 was ∼50% of wild-type plants. In addition, vtc4-1 plants incorporate significantly more radiolabel from [2-3H]Man into l-galactosyl residues suggesting that the mutation increases the availability of GDP-l-Gal for polysaccharide synthesis. Finally, a homozygous T-DNA insertion line, which lacks a functional At3g02870 gene product, is also ascorbate-deficient (50% of wild type) and deficient in l-Gal-1-P phosphatase activity. Genetic complementation tests revealed that the insertion mutant and VTC4-1 are alleles of the same genetic locus. The significantly lower ascorbate and perturbed l-Gal metabolism in vtc4-1 and the T-DNA insertion mutant indicate that l-Gal-1-P phosphatase plays a role in plant ascorbate biosynthesis. The presence of ascorbate in the T-DNA insertion mutant suggests there is a bypass to this enzyme or that other pathways also contribute to ascorbate biosynthesis.

Waugh W.A. Science. 1932; 75: 357-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 2Svirbely J.L. Szent-Gyorgi A. Nature. 1932; 129: 576Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is used as a cofactor by a number of enzymes (3de Tullio M. Asard H. May J.M. Smirnoff N. Vitamin C: Function and Biochemistry in Animals and Plants. Bios Scientific Publishers, Oxford2004: 159-171Google Scholar), but it is perhaps better known for its role as an antioxidant. Many different organisms make use of ascorbate to detoxify the variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS 5The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; BC2, backcross 2; DTT, dithiothreitol; Fru, fructose; Fuc, fucose; Gal, galactose; Glc, glucose; Gul, gulose; IMPase, inositol monophosphatase; Man, mannose; WT, wild type; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; KO, knock out; RT, reverse transcription; F, forward; R, reverse; PAP, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate.; O2,O2−˙, H2O2, and HO·) that are generated as a result of an aerobic life-style. One electron can be donated from ascorbate, forming monodehydroascorbate (ascorbate-free radical), whereas donation of a second electron results in production of the fully oxidized dehydroascorbate (4Buettner G.R. Schafer F.Q. Asard H. May J.M. Smirnoff N. Vitamin C: Function and Biochemistry in Animals and Plants. Bios Scientific Publishers, Oxford2004: 173-188Google Scholar). Both plants and animals possess monodehydroascorbate and dehydroascorbate reductases to recycle the oxidized forms back to ascorbate (5May J.M. Asard H. Asard H. May J.M. Smirnoff N. Vitamin C: Function and Biochemistry in Animals and Plants. Bios Scientific Publishers, Oxford2004: 139-157Google Scholar). Ascorbate is highly abundant in plant tissues, with concentrations in the 1–20 mm range, and not surprisingly has a major function in the maintenance of ROS homeostasis. ROS are formed as by-products of a variety of physiological processes, including the β-oxidation of fatty acids, photosynthesis, and photorespiration. The role of ascorbate in the detoxification of ROS generated by both abiotic and biotic environmental conditions (e.g. chilling, high light, drought, NaCl, heat, heavy metals, air pollutants, and pathogens) has been well studied for a number of years and is the subject of several recent reviews (6Barth C. Moeder W. Klessig D.F. Conklin P.L. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1784-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Inherent within the role of ascorbate in the maintenance of ROS homeostasis is its probable role in ROS-mediated signaling (7Conklin P.L. Williams E.H. Last R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9970-9974Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 8Conklin P.L. Barth C. Plant Cell Environ. 2004; 27: 959-970Crossref Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In short, ascorbate contributes largely to both the removal of excess damaging ROS and the control of physiologically active levels of ROS utilized in signaling networks. Ascorbate-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana mutants representing four different loci have been described that are valuable tools in the understanding of the physiological roles of ascorbate. The first of these mutants, vtc1-1 (vitamin c 1), was isolated in a screen for ozone-sensitive mutants (7Conklin P.L. Williams E.H. Last R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9970-9974Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and contains ∼25–30% of the wild-type (WT) level of ascorbate. In addition to its sensitivity to ozone, this mutant has enhanced sensitivity to sulfur dioxide and ultraviolet B radiation (7Conklin P.L. Williams E.H. Last R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9970-9974Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), increased genome instability (9Filkowski J. Kovalchuk O. Kovalchuk I. Plant J. 2004; 38: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and constitutively induced defense proteins that correlate with increased levels of salicylic acid and resistance to virulent strains of both Pseudomonas syringae and Peronospora parasitica (6Barth C. Moeder W. Klessig D.F. Conklin P.L. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1784-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The vtc1-1 mutant has altered expression of 171 transcripts, including those of several defense genes and genes involved in hormone signaling (10Pastori G.M. Kiddle G. Antoniw J. Bernard S. Veljovic-Jovanovic S. Verrier P.J. Noctor G. Foyer C.H. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). It also exhibits signs of premature senescence, both visually and at the molecular level, which has led to the idea that the pathogen resistance of this mutant may be age-related (6Barth C. Moeder W. Klessig D.F. Conklin P.L. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1784-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The second ascorbate-deficient complementation group, vtc2, was isolated in a nitro blue tetrazolium-based screen (11Conklin P.L. Saracco S.A. Norris S.R. Last R.L. Genetics. 2000; 154: 847-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant vtc2-2 has been utilized to better understand the role of ascorbate in both violaxanthin de-epoxidase activity in vivo (12Muller-Moule P. Conklin P.L. Niyogi K.K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 970-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and in acclimation of photosynthesis to high light (13Muller-Moule P. Havaux M. Niyogi K.K. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The VTC2 gene has been cloned but its function is as yet unknown (14Jander G. Norris S.R. Rounsley S.D. Bush D.F. Levin I.M. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The ascorbate-deficient mutants vtc3–1 and vtc4-1 were also isolated in the above-mentioned nitro blue tetrazolium-based screen and at 2 weeks of age were found to contain less than 50% of WT levels of ascorbate (11Conklin P.L. Saracco S.A. Norris S.R. Last R.L. Genetics. 2000; 154: 847-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the utility of vtc1-1 mutant as an aid in the functional analysis of ascorbate, it has also proven invaluable as a genetic tool in the study of ascorbic acid biosynthesis in plants. In 1998, a novel plant ascorbic acid biosynthetic pathway was proposed in which l-Gal is oxidized sequentially to l-galactono-1,4-lactone and ascorbate (15Wheeler G.L. Jones M.A. Smirnoff N. Nature. 1998; 393: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 16Smirnoff N. Conklin P.L. Loewus F.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The newly proposed pathway resolved a puzzle regarding the source of substrate for the previously well characterized plant l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (15Wheeler G.L. Jones M.A. Smirnoff N. Nature. 1998; 393: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling studies showed that l-Gal is derived from GDP-Man (15Wheeler G.L. Jones M.A. Smirnoff N. Nature. 1998; 393: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Functional in planta evidence for this pathway was provided by the VTC1 gene, which encodes GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase and forms GDP-Man from Man-1-P (Fig. 1) (17Conklin P.L. Norris S.R. Wheeler G.L. Williams E.H. Smirnoff N. Last R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4198-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The vtc1-1 mutant has a point mutation in this gene, lowered activity of this enzyme, and is ascorbate-deficient. In addition to the GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase gene, the genes encoding GDP-Man 3″,5″-epimerase, l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase, and the l-Gal dehydrogenase have also been identified (18Gatzek S. Wheeler G.L. Smirnoff N. Plant J. 2002; 30: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 19Wolucka B.A. Persiau G. Van Doorsselaere J. Davey M.W. Demol H. Vandekerckhove J. Van Montagu M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30009-30016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). GDP-Man 3″, 5″-epimerase converts GDP-Man to GDP-l-Gal, which is then proposed to be broken down in two steps to l-Gal (Fig. 1, steps 3 and 4). Additionally, it has been shown that GDP-l-gulose is also produced as a result of GDP-Man 3″, 5″-epimerase activity and could be converted to ascorbate via l-gulonolactone (Fig. 1) (21Wolucka B.A. Van Montagu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47483-47490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Reduction of l-Gal dehydrogenase and l-galactono-1, 4-lactone dehydrogenase activities in planta (via anti-sense suppression) leads to reduced levels of ascorbate (18Gatzek S. Wheeler G.L. Smirnoff N. Plant J. 2002; 30: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 22Tabata K. Oba K. Suzuki K. Esaka M. Plant J. 2001; 27: 139-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a gene encoding an enzyme with l-Gal-1-P phosphatase activity was identified in kiwi fruit and A. thaliana (23Laing W.A. Bulley S. Wright M. Cooney J. Jensen D. Barraclough D. MacRae E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16976-16981Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This enzyme is predicted to take part in ascorbate biosynthesis (Fig. 1, step 4). As described below, we have found that the ascorbate-deficient A. thaliana vtc4-1 mutant harbors a defect in the same l-Gal-1-P phosphatase gene, providing genetic evidence for the role of this enzyme in plant ascorbate biosynthesis. Measurement of Ascorbate Content—Acidic extracts were prepared from whole rosettes of 3-week-old vtc4-1 (backcross 2 generation; BC2) and WT ecotype Columbia-0 for the assay of the total and reduced ascorbate as described previously (7Conklin P.L. Williams E.H. Last R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9970-9974Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 24Conklin P.L. Pallanca J.E. Last R.L. Smirnoff N. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). At least three whole rosettes were used in each extract, and the average ascorbate (total and reduced) content from five extracts/genotype was determined. The plants used for these assays were grown with a 16-h photoperiod under metal halide bulbs in a commercial soil-less mix (Promix BX; Premier Horticulture Inc., Quakertown, PA). For the assay of total ascorbate in WT, vtc4-1 BC2, insertion line KO-1, insertion line KO-2, F1 (vtc4-1 × KO-1), F1 (vtc4-1 × KO-2), expanded leaves from at least three different 2-week-old rosettes were utilized for each extract, and the average total ascorbate was determined from three extracts/genotype. The plants used for these assays were grown in an environmental growth chamber (Percival AR36L3) under a 24-h photoperiod at 21 °C with 70% relative humidity under fluorescent bulbs at 150 μmol s–1 m–2 photosynthetic photon flux density. Fine-scale Genetic Mapping of the VTC4 Locus—The VTC4 locus was found to be located ∼2-centimorgan centromeres distal from microsatellite marker nga172 as described previously (11Conklin P.L. Saracco S.A. Norris S.R. Last R.L. Genetics. 2000; 154: 847-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A population of 1772 F2 individuals derived from a cross between VTC4/VTC4 (Landsberg erecta ecotype) and vtc4-1/vtc4-1 (Columbia-0 ecotype) was utilized in the fine-scale genetic mapping. The VTC4-specific genotype of each recombinant was verified in the F3 generation. The insertion/deletion marker (12/–12; CER469590; Cereon Arabidopsis Polymorphism Collection, see Ref. 14Jander G. Norris S.R. Rounsley S.D. Bush D.F. Levin I.M. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) that defined the closest centromere distal break-point was amplified using the following primers: 5′-ACAACAATGGCGATCA-3′ and 5′-CATCCTCTGGTAAAGACAC-3′. This marker is located at ∼70 kb on BAC F13E7. The three tightly linked single nucleotide polymorphism markers that defined the closest centromere proximal recombination breakpoint (CER467138-140; Cereon Arabidopsis Polymorphism Collection, see Ref. 14Jander G. Norris S.R. Rounsley S.D. Bush D.F. Levin I.M. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) were amplified and sequenced using the following primers: 5′-ACGCGACAGCTTTCCCATTT-3′ and 5′-GGCTTGCGTGAGTGTATTCTTTCT-3′. These tightly linked single nucleotide polymorphisms are located at ∼26 kb on BAC F13E7. All amplifications in this study were performed using a PCRExpress thermocycler (ThermoElectron Corp., Waltham, MA) unless stated otherwise. Sequencing of the VTC4 Locus—Total DNA was isolated from vtc4-1 (BC2) and Columbia-0 WT using a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide mini-prep method as described previously (25Lukowitz W. Nickle T.C. Meinke D.W. Last R.L. Conklin P.L. Somerville C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2262-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The VTC4 locus was amplified from these DNAs using two PCR primer pairs (Sigma Genosys, The Woodlands, TX) that together amplified the VTC4 candidate gene (At3g02870). One set of primers (F, 5′-CGTTGGGACTGGCTGTATC-3′; R, 5′-AAACAACTCCAACAACAGGG-3′) amplified a 2036-bp product, including 1193 bp upstream of the ATG start codon. A second set of primers (F, 5′-CCAATTTCGTTCACGGGTAT-3′;R, 5′-GGACAACAGTCACCGTGAGA-3′) amplified a 1749-bp overlapping product that included 488 bp 3′ of the stop codon. Sequencing primers nested within these two products (and in some cases, single PCR primers) were used to obtain genomic sequence from vtc4-1 that spanned from 715 bases upstream of the putative 5′-transcript terminus to 192 bp downstream of the putative 3′-transcript terminus (Biotechnology Resource Center, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). Both strands of vtc4-1 DNA were sequenced in the region of the mutation. One strand of WT Columbia-0 DNA was sequenced in this same region to verify the published WT genomic sequence. Identification of Homozygous Insertion Mutant at the VTC4 Locus—Segregating T3 generation seed for the SAIL_8443_G10 sequence indexed insertion line (26Sessions A. Burke E. Presting G. Aux G. McElver J. Patton D. Dietrich B. Ho P. Bacwaden J. Ko C. Clarke J.D. Cotton D. Bullis D. Snell J. Miguel T. Hutchison D. Kimmerly B. Mitzel T. Katagiri F. Glazebrook J. Law M. Goff S.A. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2985-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Total DNA was isolated from 16 individual plants as described above. The VTC4 locus was amplified from these DNAs using the second set of (flanking) primers described above. Those individual lines that did not yield a PCR product with these VTC4 WT allele-specific primers were then each amplified in a series of two separate PCRs using the insertion primer LB1 (5′-GCCTTTTCAGAAATGGATAAATAGCC TTGCTTCC-3′) and either the F or R flanking primers. Five homozygous insertion individuals and six heterozygous individuals were identified using this series of amplification reactions. To confirm the site of the insertion, the ∼1.5-kb PCR product obtained from amplification of line 11 with LB1 and the VTC4 R flanking primer was gel-purified and sequenced as above using the LB1 insertion-specific primer as the sequencing primer. To confirm the genotypes of the F1 (vtc4-1 × KO-1) and F1 (vtc4-1 × KO-2) individuals, DNA was extracted from at least five F1 plants derived from each cross as described above and genotyped by PCR in two separate reactions/genotype (along with WT, vtc4-1, KO-1 T4, and KO-2 T4 DNAs as controls) using the VTC4 flanking F and R primers in one reaction (noninsertion allele specific product) and the VTC4 R and LB1 primers in a second reaction (insertion allele-specific product). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—For the semi-quantitative assay of transcript levels in vtc4-1 in comparison with WT, the following protocol was utilized. Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis leaves collected just prior to flowering using an RNeasy plant RNA kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) and treated with DNase (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Synthesis of cDNA was carried out, using 5 μg of total RNA as template, with random primers (RETRO-script, Ambion, Huntingdon, UK) and Superscript II (Invitrogen). Semi-quantitative PCR, using the cDNA as template, was performed using an 18S Competimer system (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used in the PCR were 5′-GGAAAGGAGCATTCTTGAATGG-3′ and 5′-CAACGCCTCAGCGAATAAC-3′ and the cycling parameters consisted of 2 cycles (96 °C 1 min, 50 °C 30 s, and 72 °C 1 min) followed by 32 cycles (92 °C 25 s, 54 °C 30 s, and 72 °C 1 min) and a 10-min extension at 72 °C. For the assay of the presence/absence of transcript in WT, versus the insertion lines KO-1 and KO-2, total RNA was isolated from 100 mg of Arabidopsis leaves collected from plants 20 days of age that were grown in an environmental growth chamber (Percival AR36L3) under the same conditions as the plants utilized for the total ascorbate assays described above. The RNA was isolated using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). Synthesis of cDNA was carried out using 1 μgof total RNA as the template, with the VTC4RTR 5′-CAACGCCTCAGCGAATAAC-3′, the UBQ10R 5′-CGACTTGTCATTAGAAAGAAAGAGATAACAGC-3′, and ferredoxin-nitrite reductase R 5′-CCACGGATCTGCCAATTCTGT-3′ gene-specific primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Nonquantitative PCRs were then performed using the above cDNAs as templates and the following primers in addition to the reverse primers listed above: VTC4RTF 5′-GGAAAGGAGCATTCTTGAATGG-3, UBQ10F 5′, UBQF 5′-GATCTTTGCCGGAAAACAATTGGAGGATGG-3′, and ferredoxin-nitrite reductase F 5′-TCCGGTTCCACCTGCCAACA-3′. Cycling parameters consisted of 1 cycle (95 °C 3 min) followed by 40 cycles (94 °C 20 s, 54 °C (VTC4RTF/R and ferredoxin-nitrate reductase F/R) or 58 °C (UBQFR) 20 s, 72 °C 1 min) and a 5-min extension at 72 °C. Ascorbate Biosynthesis from [U-14C]Man and [1-14C]Ascorbate Metabolism—d-[U-14C]Man (1 μCi per sample, specific activity 290 mCi mmol–1; Amersham Biosciences) or [1-14C]ascorbate (27Pallanca J.E. Smirnoff N. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 51: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was supplied via the petiole to whole excised Arabidopsis leaves from 6-week-old plants. Following radiolabel nated uptake (1 h), leaves were illumi-(60–70 μmol m–2s–1 photosynthetic photon flux density) in sealed Perspex boxes for 4 h. Leaves were rinsed thoroughly prior to perchloric acid extraction and determination of incorporation of [14C]ascorbate and other fractions as described previously (24Conklin P.L. Pallanca J.E. Last R.L. Smirnoff N. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, leaf tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen, homogenized in 1 ml of 5% perchloric acid, 1 mm EDTA, and centrifuged (12,000 × g, 2 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was neutralized by the addition of 60 μlof5 m potassium carbonate and centrifuged again (12,000 × g, 2 min, 4 °C). The ascorbate concentration in the resultant supernatant was determined by the ascorbate oxidase method (24Conklin P.L. Pallanca J.E. Last R.L. Smirnoff N. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), prior to ion exchange fractionation. This allowed determination of the recovery of ascorbate after ion exchange and HPLC separation. The resultant supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 10% dithiothreitol (DTT) and fractionated by ion exchange chromatography (SAX column, HPLC Technology, Macclesfield, UK). Ascorbate was eluted from the column with 60 mm formic acid. The eluent was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized. Samples were reconstituted in 6 mm formic acid and loaded onto a Rezex ROA HPLC column (Phenomenex, Macclesfield, UK) using a mobile phase of 0.75 mm sulfuric acid (0.5 ml min–1). Ascorbate was detected by UV absorbance at 260 nm. The identity of the ascorbate peak was confirmed in preliminary experiments by treatment of the samples with ascorbate oxidase. This removed the peak detected by HPLC at 260 and 210 nm. Radioactivity in the eluent fractions corresponding to ascorbate was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The rate of turnover of ascorbate was calculated from [1-14C]ascorbate metabolism as described previously (27Pallanca J.E. Smirnoff N. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 51: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Incorporation of d-[2-3H]Man into Polysaccharides—d-[2-3H]Man (2–5 μCi, specific activity 10–20 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences) was supplied to small expanding leaves from young Arabidopsis plants (2–3 weeks old) via their petioles. Following uptake of the radiolabel (2 h), leaves were illuminated (60–70 μmol m–2 s–1 photosynthetic photon flux density) in sealed Perspex boxes for 4 h. Samples were then rinsed thoroughly prior to homogenization in ice-cold 80% ethanol. Insoluble material was collected by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 2 min) and washed three times with 80% ethanol. Polysaccharides and oligo-saccharides associated with glycoproteins in this material were hydrolyzed by incubation with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 110 °C for 1 h (28Fry S.C. The Growing Plant Cell Wall: Chemical and Metabolic Analysis. Longman Scientific & Technical, Harlow, UK1988Google Scholar). Nonhydrolyzed material was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 2 min), and trifluoroacetic acid was removed from the supernatant by evaporation. Monosaccharides were separated by TLC (29Ghebregzabher M. Rufini S. Monaldi B. Lato M. J. Chromatogr. 1976; 127: 133-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Separation was performed by an acetone/butanol/water solvent (8:1:1 v/v) on silica gel TLC plates (Whatman) pre-soaked in 0.3 m sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate and then dried. The radioactivity was detected by a Berthold LB2832 Linear Analyser (Wildbad, Germany). Radioactive peaks were identified by co-chromatography with authentic standards. d-Gal was removed by treatment with d-Gal dehydrogenase (from Pseudomonas fluorescens, Sigma). The reaction mixture contained 0.1 unit of d-Gal dehydrogenase and a 10-μl sample in 175 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, containing 7 mm NAD+ and was incubated for 16 h. Samples were then deionized by ion exchange chromatography to facilitate TLC analysis. This technique fully resolves l-Fuc, l-Gal, and d-Man, but l-Gul is not resolved from d-Man. Assay of l-Gal-1-P Phosphatase—Rosette leaves from plants just prior to flowering, grown under a 16-h light period at 150 mmol s–1 m–2 photosynthetic photon flux density (20 °C during light period, 15 °C during dark period), were homogenized in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm aminocaproic acid, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 g of tissue, 10 ml of extract). Duplicate extracts were made for each experiment, and the experiments were repeated on two occasions with identical results. Tissue debris was filtered off, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 40% saturation, and precipitated protein was pelleted by centrifugation as before for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and ammonium sulfate added to give 60% saturation. After centrifugation, the pelleted protein was recovered. This was dissolved in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm DTT. l-Gal-1-P phosphatase activity was determined by incubating a 10-μl sample with 80 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mm l-Gal-1-P and 3 mm MgCl2 for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then boiled for 2 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min. l-Fucose (l-Fuc; 0.05 mm final concentration) was added as an internal standard. The sugars in 20 μl of this sample were separated and quantified using a Dionex DX600 LC with a CarboPac PA-10 column and electrochemical detection. The mobile phase was 18 mm NaOH at 1 ml min–1, and the column was washed with 200 mm NaOH between samples. The ED50 electrochemical detector was equipped with a gold electrode and was operated in pulsed amperometric mode specific for sugars (waveform: 0sat –0.05 V, 0.2 s at 0.05 V (integration on) 0.4 s at 0.05 V (integration off) 0.41 s at 0.075 V, 0.6 s at 0.75 V, 0.61 s at –0.15 V, 1.00 s at –0.15 V). The l-Gal-1-P was a gift from J. Thiem (University of Hamburg, Germany). Decreased Ascorbate Synthesis from Man in vtc4—As described previously (11Conklin P.L. Saracco S.A. Norris S.R. Last R.L. Genetics. 2000; 154: 847-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the A. thaliana mutant vtc4-1 (vitamin C 4) was isolated in a nitro blue tetrazolium-based screen for ascorbic acid-deficient ethane methyl sulfonate-generated mutants of the Columbia-0 ecotype. VTC4 is one of four VTC loci identified by this screen (6Barth C. Moeder W. Klessig D.F. Conklin P.L. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1784-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). At 3 weeks of age, the homozygous vtc4-1 mutant contains ∼42% of the total ascorbate found in WT plants (Fig. 2A). Although deficient in total ascorbate, the redox status of vtc4-1 (the ratio of total to reduced ascorbate) does not significantly differ from that of WT (Fig. 2B). Both genotypes maintain a highly reduced pool of ascorbate (∼88% for WT and ∼ 85% for vtc4-1). Radiolabeling experiments were carried out to determine whether the low ascorbate content of vtc4 is caused by slower biosynthesis via the d-Man pathway or by faster catabolism. Leaves were labeled with d-[14C]Man, extracted, and fractionated into soluble and insoluble compounds and CO2. Ascorbate was separated by HPLC and its 14C content determined. 30% less14C was incorporated into ascorbate in vtc1 compared with WT, whereas the distribution of label in other fractions did not differ (Table 1). This compares closely to the 42% reduction in ascorbate content. Feeding [14C]ascorbate and determining the transfer of 14C to other compounds estimated ascorbate turnover (27Pallanca J.E. Smirnoff N. J."
https://openalex.org/W1963904512,"We showed previously that cells expressing wild-type (WT) β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) or coexpressing WTAPP and WT presenilin (PS) 1/2 produced APP intracellular domains (AICD) 49-99 and 50-99, with the latter predominating. On the other hand, the cells expressing mutant (MT) APP or coexpressing WTAPP and MTPS1/2 produced a greater proportion of AICD-(49-99) than AICD-(50-99). In addition, the expression of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) 49 in cells resulted in predominant production of Aβ40 and that of Aβ48 leads to preferential production of Aβ42. These observations suggest that ϵ-cleavage and γ-cleavage are interrelated. To determine the stoichiometry between Aβ and AICD, we have established a 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid-solubilized γ-secretase assay system that exhibits high specific activity. By using this assay system, we have shown that equal amounts of Aβ and AICD are produced from β-carboxyl-terminal fragment (C99) by γ-secretase, irrespective of WT or MTAPP and PS1/2. Although various Aβ species, including Aβ40, Aβ42, Aβ43, Aβ45, Aβ48, and Aβ49, are generated, only two species of AICD, AICD-(49-99) and AICD-(50-99), are detected. We also have found that M233T MTPS1 produced only one species of AICD, AICD-(49-99), and only one for its counterpart, Aβ48, in contrast to WT and other MTPS1s. These strongly suggest thatϵ-cleavage is the primary event, and the produced Aβ48 and Aβ49 rapidly undergo γ-cleavage, resulting in generation of various Aβ species.

Current data indicate that Aβ forms large fibrous aggregates that may not be toxic to the cells, but its intermediates, diffusible oligomers, exhibit neuronal toxicity, supporting the view that Aβ is a real culprit for AD. This 38-43-amino acid residue, a small protein, is derived from β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) through successive cleavages by β- and γ-secretases (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar). β-Secretase is a membrane-bound aspartyl protease and produces a carboxyl-terminal fragment (βCTF or C99) of APP by cleaving its luminal portion (2Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). Cumulative evidence indicates that γ-secretase is also an aspartyl protease, a high molecular mass protein complex composed of four different membrane proteins, Aph-1, nicastrin, Pen-2, and presenilin (PS) 1/2 (3Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 4Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M. Takahashi Y.

The mechanism of Aβ production is controversial, mainly because the hydrolytic event is postulated to occur in the very hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer. Besides γ-cleavage sites, we and other groups identified novel cleavage sites close to the membrane/cytoplasmic boundary of APP (ϵ-cleavage) (6Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). ϵ-Cleavage sites of C99 are analogous to the γ-secretase-mediated Notch S3 cleavage site (9Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). As in Notch signaling, ϵ-cleavage results in release of the APP intracellular domains (AICD) 49-99 and 50-99, which translocate to the nucleus and influence transcriptional regulation (10Kimberly W.T.

Pimplikar S.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We also found that PS1/2 and APP carrying familial AD (FAD) mutations increase the proportion of AICD-(49-99) (14Sato T. Dohmae N. Qi Y. Kakuda N. Misonou H. Mitsumori R. Maruyama H. Koo E.H.

As FAD mutations cause an increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar), we assumed that relationships exist between γ- and ϵ-cleavage sites. In fact, Aβ48 and Aβ49, the products that should have been generated by ϵ-cleavage, are converted to Aβ40 and Aβ42 within the cells (15Funamoto S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Hirotani N. Saido T.C. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13532-13540Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). More importantly, the expression of Aβ49 results in predominant release of Aβ40 into media, whereas that of Aβ48 preferentially produced Aβ42. This indicates that the preceding ϵ-cleavage determines the preference for the final product, Aβ40 or Aβ42. Failure to identify AICD-(41-99) and AICD-(43-99), possible counterparts of Aβ40/42, led us to assume that ϵ-cleavage precedes γ-cleavage. According to this model, γ-secretase should produce equal amounts of Aβ and AICD from C99. However, it is difficult to determine accurately the stoichiometry between Aβ and AICD in cells, because Aβ is only derived from C99, whereas AICD is generated from both C99 and C83 (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar), the latter of which is usually severalfold more abundant in cells than C99. In addition, AICD in the cells is more susceptible to proteases than Aβ (16Weidemann A. Paliga K. Durrwang U. Reinhard F.B. Schuckert O. Evin G. Masters C.L. J. Biol.

For these reasons, the stoichiometry of Aβ relative to AICD has remained unclear. However, its elucidation is important for understanding the relationship between γ- and ϵ-cleavages and the mechanism of Aβ production by the enigmatic γ-secretase. In this study, we have examined the stoichiometry between Aβ and AICD using a CHAPSO-solubilized γ-secretase assay system (20Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P.

Cell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). CHO cells expressing human wild-type (WT) or mutant (MT) PS1/2 were generated as described by Yagishita et al. (22Yagishita S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Ishiura S. Ihara I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3952-3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Displacement of endogenous (hamster) PS by exogenous (human) PS was confirmed with each cell line (22Yagishita S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Ishiura S. Ihara I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3952-3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Preparation of C99-FLAG Substrate—A carboxyl-terminal fragment of APP (C99) was carboxyl-terminally fused with FLAG tag (C99-FLAG) and amino-terminally with signal peptide (MQLRNPELHLGCALALRFLALVSWDIPGARA) of human α-galactosidase A. Resultant fragment was inserted into pFASTBAC™1 (Invitrogen). Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus according to the manufacturer's instructions. Infected cells (60-ml culture) were harvested after 36 h and resuspended in 0.3-0.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl). The suspension was mixed with equal amount of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40 and 2× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)) and incubated on ice for 1 h. After ultracentrifugation at 245,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was agitated with 0.2 ml of ANTI-FLAG® M2-agarose beads (Sigma) overnight. C99-FLAG was eluted from the beads by incubation with 0.2 ml of 100 mm glycine HCl, pH 2.7, for 10 min at room temperature, and the eluate was immediately neutralized by addition of 1/25 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Concentrations of residual Nonidet P-40 in purified C99-FLAG were estimated to be 0.3-0.4% from elution volume. The eluted C99-FLAG was confirmed for its purity and quantified by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after gel electrophoresis. γ-Secretase Assay and Detection of Aβ and AICD—Microsomal fractions of CHO cells were obtained as described previously (15Funamoto S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Hirotani N. Saido T.C. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13532-13540Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, the harvested cells were homogenized in buffer A (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 140 mm KCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm EGTA) using a glass/Teflon homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. The postnuclear supernatants were recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellets representing the microsomal fractions were suspended in a buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA). Their protein concentrations were adjusted at 10 mg/ml. The membranes were solubilized by the addition of equal volume of 2× NK buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 2% CHAPSO (Sigma; catalogue number C3649; lot numbers 013K5314 and 015K5313), 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 20 μg/ml antipain, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml TLCK, 10 mm phenanthroline, and 2 mm thiorphan) and incubated on ice for 1 h (20Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9774-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatants were saved (1% CHAPSO lysate). 1% CHAPSO lysate was diluted with 3 volumes of CHAPSO-free buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml TLCK, 5 mm phenanthroline, and 1 mm thiorphan) containing defined amounts of C99-FLAG. Furthermore, 0.1% phosphatidylcholine (catalogue number P3556, lot number 034K5218; Sigma) was added into the diluted lysate, which significantly enhanced the activity of γ-secretase but did not alter the proportion of Aβ40/42 produced. Residual Nonidet P-40 in the substrate should be estimated carefully before starting the reaction. The Nonidet P-40 concentrations at 0.2% and above in the reaction mixture abolished γ-secretase activity. Its final concentrations in all reactions in this study were kept less than 0.06%, which exhibited no noticeable suppression in Aβ and AICD productions. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1), and protein residues were subjected to quantitative Western blotting with defined amounts of synthetic Aβ as a control. For AICD standard, we used CTF50 synthetic peptide (AICD-(50-99); Calbiochem) or AICD-(50-99)-FLAG expressed in Escherichia coli as described below. For detection of Aβ, 82E1, a monoclonal antibody end-specific for the amino terminus of human Aβ (IBL, Gunma, Japan) was used (23Horikoshi Y. Sakaguchi G. Becker A.G. Gray A.J. Duff K. Aisen P.S. Yamaguchi H. Maeda M. Kinoshita N. Matsuoka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To visualize AICD, UT-421 (gift of Dr. T. Suzuki, Hokkaido University) raised against carboxyl-terminal sequence of APP was used (24Tomita S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19304-19310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All blots in this study were immersed in boiled phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min before blocking in 5% skim milk, which significantly enhanced the detectability of the antigens. Quantification of Authentic AICD-(50-99)-FLAG—AICD-(50-99)-FLAG was expressed in E. coli and affinity-purified with ANTI-FLAG M2 beads®. The protein concentrations of authentic AICD-(50-99)-FLAG were determined using both amino acid compositional analysis that determines the total protein amount, and sequence analysis that assesses the specific amount of AICD-(50-99)-FLAG. The appropriate amounts of AICD-(50-99)-FLAG were purified by reverse-phase liquid chromatography on super-Phenyl column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) with 0-48% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peak fractions were collected and rechromatographed under the same condition. Compared between the peak areas of the first and second chromatogram, chromatographic recovery was estimated (about 58%). Pooled fractions from the second chromatography were dried and hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl vapor at 110 °C for 20 h. The acid hydrolysate was derivatized with 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate and quantified as described by Shindo et al. (25Shindo N. Nojima S. Fujimura T. Taka H. Mineki R. Murayama K. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For amino acid sequence analysis, an appropriate amount of AICD-FLAG was subjected to Edman degradation using a Procise cLC protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to obtain the amino-terminal 10-residue sequence. Repetitive yield and initial yield were calculated from the sequence. Detection of Longer Aβs Produced by γ-Secretase—Various longer Aβ species were separated on a Tris, Tricine, 8 m urea gel with minor modifications (22Yagishita S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y.

A 10% T/3% C separation gel, pH 8.45, containing 8 m urea (gel system I) was used to separate Aβ37 through Aβ45. A 12% T/3% C separation gel, pH 8.90, containing 8 m urea (gel system II) was used to separate Aβ46 through Aβ49. The spacer and stacking gels did not contain urea. Following transfer, the blots were probed with 82E1 to detect only Aβs that begin at Asp-1 and developed using an ECL system. Intensities of the bands were quantified using a LAS-1000 plus luminescent image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).

Most of quantitative studies on Aβ and AICD productions were performed in the presence of large amounts of αCTF, which is processed to p3 and AICD but not to Aβ. In addition, levels of Aβ and AICD were assessed by methods based on different principles, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Aβ released into media and indirect luciferase transactivation assay for AICD. To our knowledge, rigorous quantitative determination by conventional Western blotting of the produced Aβ and AICD has never been performed. To examine the stoichiometry of Aβ relative to AICD, we took advantage of the CHAPSO-solubilized γ-secretase assay system (20Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P.

C99 was fused at the carboxyl terminus with FLAG tag (C99-FLAG) and expressed in Sf9 cells. After C99-FLAG was purified by Anti-FLAG M2 (see “Experimental Procedures”), and its purity was confirmed, and its amounts were quantified by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 2B). Purified 0.5 μm C99-FLAG was incubated in 0.25% CHAPSO-lysate of CHO cells. Aβ species produced by our assay system were separated on gel system I (22Yagishita S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y.

The amount of each Aβ species was estimated from densitometric scanning of the Western blot and increased in a time-dependent linear fashion (data not shown). Each Aβ species appeared to be generated by random cleavage depending on the interaction between susceptible sites and catalytic sites. Robust signals for Aβ42 and Aβ43 were detected as well as for Aβ40, which contrasts with the major Aβ species in cell-based and cell-free assays (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol.

In addition to Aβ45, Aβ species longer than Aβ45 were also detected and stuck at the bottom of gel (Fig. 1A, top panel). Gel system II (22Yagishita S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Ishiura S.

Against increasing concentrations of C99-FLAG, band intensities of all Aβ species were plotted as the percentage of intensity of synthetic Aβ45 (50 pg) on each blot (Fig. 1, B and C). The production rates of all Aβ species appeared to follow the Michaelis-Menten type curve (Fig. 1C). The apparent Km (Kapp) and Vmax values for various Aβ species were summarized in Table 1. As can be seen in Fig. 1, A and B, this solubilized γ-secretase assay system was characterized by abundant Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ43 and small or trace amounts of Aβ45, Aβ48, and Aβ49. The majority of Aβ species produced by the assay system consisted of Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ43 (see below).FIGURE 1Aβ species generated by the solubilized γ-secretase assay system. A, the microsomal fraction of CHO cells was solubilized with CHAPSO and incubated with 500 nm C99-FLAG; the reaction was terminated at the time indicated by placing a reaction tube on ice. The Aβs produced, together with synthetic authentic Aβs, were separated on gel I (top panel) and gel II (bottom panel), followed by Western blotting with 82E1, a monoclonal antibody specific for the amino terminus of Aβ.Aβ40, Aβ42, Aβ43, and Aβ45 were produced in a time-dependent manner. Aβ46 and longer Aβs were stuck at the bottom of gel I. Gel II showed that the longer Aβs were Aβ48 and Aβ49 and that they were also produced in a time-dependent manner. B, defined amounts of C99-FLAG were incubated with CHAPSO-solubilized microsomal fraction of CHO cells. Protein samples were separated on gel I and II. Against increasing concentrations of C99-FLAG, intensities of each Aβ species were plotted as percentage of 50 pg of synthetic Aβ45. Retaining efficiencies of various Aβs were postulated to be the same. C, data represent means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Apparent Km and Vmax values are summarized in Table 1. D and E, the CHAPSO-solubilized microsomal fraction was incubated with 500 nm C99-FLAG in the presence of L-685,458 (D) and DAPT (E) at the indicated concentrations. Production of all Aβ species was uniformly suppressed by both γ-secretase inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner. This contrasts with findings in cell-based or cell-free assay systems, in which DAPT induces differential accumulation of Aβ43 and Aβ46. Arrowheads indicate carboxyl-terminally truncated, C99-FLAG fragments (27Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R.

For instance, ethambutol targets arabinogalactan biosynthesis through inhibition of the arabinofuranosyltransferases Mt-EmbA and Mt-EmbB. Following a detailed bioinformatics analysis of genes surrounding the conserved emb locus, we present the identification and characterization of a novel arabinofuranosyltransferase AftA (Rv3792). The enzyme catalyzes the addition of the first key arabinofuranosyl residue from the sugar donor β-d-arabinofuranosyl-1-monophosphoryldecaprenol to the galactan domain of the cell wall, thus “priming” the galactan for further elaboration by the arabinofuranosyltransferases. Because aftA is an essential gene in M. tuberculosis, we deleted its orthologue in Corynebacterium glutamicum to produce a slow growing but viable mutant. Analysis of its cell wall revealed the complete absence of arabinose resulting in a truncated cell wall structure possessing only a galactan core with a concomitant loss of cell wall-bound mycolates. Complementation of the mutant was fully restored to the wild type phenotype by Cg-aftA. In addition, by developing an in vitro assay using recombinant Escherichia coli expressing Mt-aftA and use of cell wall galactan as an acceptor, we demonstrated the transfer of arabinose from β-d-arabinofuranosyl-1-monophosphoryldecaprenol to galactan, and unlike the Mt-Emb proteins, Mt-AftA was not inhibited by ethambutol.

Moreover, partial acid hydrolysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis identified the precise location of the three singular t-Araf residues attached to the galactan core on the 8th, 10th, and 12th galactofuranose (Galf) residue, thus representing the anchor points of the intact arabinan domains of AG (6Alderwick L.J. Radmacher E. Seidel M. Gande R. Hitchen P.G. Morris H.R. Dell A. Sahm H. Eggeling L. Besra G.S. J. Biol.

Treatment of C. glutamicum with EMB resulted in an identical phenotype comparable with the C. glutamicum Δemb mutant (6Alderwick L.J. Radmacher E. Seidel M. Gande R. Hitchen P.G. Morris H.R. Dell A. Sahm H. Eggeling L. Besra G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32362-32371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to the disruption of Ms-embA and Ms-embB, deletion of Cg-emb leads to an almost entire absence of arabinose in the cell wall, apart from specific t-Araf residues that are directly linked to the galactan backbone. This suggested the presence of a novel enzyme responsible for “priming” the galactan domain for further elaboration by the Emb proteins, resulting in the final maturation of the native AG polysaccharide. It is the aim of this study to identify this novel arabinofuranosyl-transferase, which catalyzes the addition of the first key Araf residues to the galactan domain of AG. Strains and Culture Conditions—M. tuberculosis H37Rv DNA was obtained from the Tuberculosis Research Material Contract (National Institutes of Health) at Colorado State University. C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 (the wild type strain, and in the remainder of the text it is referred to as C. glutamicum) and Escherichia coli DH5αMCR were grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB; Difco) at 30 and 37 °C, respectively. The mutants generated in this study were grown on complex medium BHIS (21Eggeling L. Reyes O. Eggeling L. Botts M. Handbook of Corynebacterium glutamicum. CRC Press, Inc., Taylor Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL2005: 535-566Crossref Google Scholar). Kanamycin and ampicillin were used at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. The minimal medium CGXII was used for C. glutamicum (21Eggeling L. Reyes O. Eggeling L. Botts M. Handbook of Corynebacterium glutamicum. CRC Press, Inc., Taylor Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL2005: 535-566Crossref Google Scholar). Samples for lipid analyses were prepared by harvesting cells at an absorbance of 10–15, followed by a saline wash and freeze drying. Cultivation of C. glutamicum ΔaftA for lipid and cell wall analysis required two pre-cultures. First, a 5-ml BHIS culture was grown for 8 h, which was then used to inoculate a 50-ml BHIS culture for 15 h. This was then used to inoculate a 100-ml BHIS culture to an absorbance of 1, which was harvested after reaching absorbance of 3. Construction of Plasmids and Strains—The vectors made were pET23b-Mt-aftA (Rv3792), pEKEx2Cg-aftA (NCgl0185), pEKEx2Mt-aftA, and pK19mobsacBΔaftA, with the gene number of the M. tuberculosis and C. glutamicum aftA orthologue added in parentheses. To construct the E. coli expression vector pET23b-Mt-aftA, the primer pair 5′-GATCGATCCATATGCCGAGCAGACGCAAAAGCCCCCAATTC-3′ and 5′-GATCGATCAAGCTTCGCGCTCTCCTGCGGCTTGCGGATGGC-3′ was used with the restriction sites NdeI and HindIII underlined, with M. tuberculosis H37Rv chromosomal DNA as a template. The purified PCR fragment was ligated with accordingly digested pET23b (Novagen). To overexpress C. glutamicum aftA, the primer pair 5′-TCCCCCGGGAAGGAGATATAGATATGATTAACACCTCTGAAGATGAAG-3′ and 5′-TCCCCCGGGTTACTCATTGTGCGTTACCACCAC-3′ was used to amplify C. glutamicum aftA, which was ligated with SmaI-cleaved pEKEx2 to generate pEKEx2Cg-aftA. Similarly, primer pairs 5′-CAGGATCCAAGGAGATATAGATATGCCGAGCAGACGCAAAAG-3′ and 5′-CAGGATCCCCATCCGCGCTCTCCTGCGGCTTGC-3′were used to clone M. tuberculosis aftA into the BamHI site of pEKEx2. To construct the deletion vector pK19mobsacBΔaftA, crossover PCR was applied with primer pairs AB (A, 5′-CGTGGATCCGGTGCC-3′; B, 5′-CCCATCCACTAAACTTAAACATTCAGAGGTGTTAATCAT-3′) and CD (C, 5′-TGTTTAAGTTTAGTGGATGGGGTGGGACCTTTCGTGGTGGTAACG-3′; D, 5′-GGCGTCCGTACTGTCCAG-3′) and C. glutamicum genomic DNA as template. Both PCR products were used in a second PCR with primer pairs AD to generate a fragment consisting of sequences adjacent to Cg-aftA, which was blunt end-ligated with SmaI-cleaved pK19mobsacB. All plasmids were finally confirmed by sequencing. The chromosomal deletion of Cg-aftA was performed as described using two rounds of positive selection (22Schafer A. Tauch A. Jager W. Kalinowski J. Thierbach G. Puhler A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar), and its successful deletion was verified by use of different primer pairs. Plasmid pET23b-Mt-aftA was used to transform chemically competent cells of E. coli C43 (DE3) to ampicillin resistance (100 μg/ml), and pEKEx2Cg-aftA was introduced into C. glutamicum ΔaftA by electroporation with selection to kanamycin resistance (25 μg/ml).

Cells (100 mg) were extracted by two consecutive extractions with 2 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v) for 3 h at 50 °C. The bound lipids from the delipidated extracts or purified cell walls (see below) were released by the addition of 5% aqueous solution of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, followed by overnight incubation at 100 °C, methylated as described previously (6Alderwick L.J.

https://openalex.org/W2062024916,"Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and Nogo are potent inhibitors of neurite outgrowth from a variety of neurons, and they have been identified as possible components of the central nervous system myelin that prevents axonal regeneration in the adult vertebrate central nervous system. The activation of RhoA and Rho-kinase is reported to be an essential part of the signaling mechanism of these proteins. Here, we report that the collapsing response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2) is phosphorylated by a Rho-kinase-dependent mechanism downstream of MAG or Nogo-66. The overexpression of the nonphosphorylated form of CRMP-2 at threonine 555, which is the phosphorylation site for Rho-kinase, counteracts the inhibitory effect of MAG on the postnatal cerebellar neurons. Additionally, the expression of the dominant negative form of CRMP-2 or knockdown of the gene using small interference RNA (siRNA) mimics the effect of MAG in vitro. Consistent with the function of CRMP-2, which promotes microtubule assembly, microtubule levels are down-regulated in the cerebellar neurons that are stimulated with MAG in vitro. Reduction in the density of microtubules is also observed in the injured axons following the spinal cord injury, and this effect depends on the Rho-kinase activity.

Our data suggest the important roles of CRMP-2 and microtubules in the inhibition of the axon regeneration by the myelin-derived inhibitors. Several myelin-derived proteins have been identified as components of the central nervous system myelin that prevents axonal regeneration in the adult vertebrate central nervous system. To date, three major inhibitors that are expressed by oligodendrocytes and myelinated fiber tracts have been identified (1McKerracher L. Winton M.J. Neuron. 2002; 36: 345-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These are Nogo, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), 2The abbreviations used are: MAG, myelin-associated glycoprotein; DRG, dorsal root ganglia; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interference RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ANOVA, analysis of variance; MLC, myosin light chain; CRMP-2, collapsing response mediator protein-2.2The abbreviations used are: MAG, myelin-associated glycoprotein; DRG, dorsal root ganglia; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interference RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ANOVA, analysis of variance; MLC, myosin light chain; CRMP-2, collapsing response mediator protein-2. and oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein. All these proteins act on neurons through the p75 receptor (p75) (2Wang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 3Wong S.T.

One potential clue to understanding the signal transduction mechanism downstream of p75 and the Nogo receptor is found through observations that demonstrate the small GTPase RhoA as a key intracellular effector for growth inhibitory signaling by myelin. In its active GTP-bound form, RhoA rigidifies the actin cytoskeleton, thereby inhibiting axon elongation and mediating growth cone collapse. RhoA is activated by MAG, Nogo-66, and oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein through a p75-dependent mechanism; thus, inhibiting neurite outgrowth from postnatal sensory neurons and cerebellar neurons (2Wang K.C.

The regulation of RhoA activity by MAG and Nogo through p75 is mediated by the release of RhoA from Rho GDI, which suppresses the RhoA activity (6Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J.

Although RhoA and one of its effectors, Rho-kinase, appear to play a key role in regulating axon growth, the mechanism by which the myelin-derived proteins regulate axon outgrowth remains to be elucidated. The outgrowth of axons is based on the dynamic rearrangement of the cytoskeleton (8Baas P.W. Luo L. Neuron. 2001; 32: 981-984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cues that influence the axon outgrowth are sensed by the growth cone, which is a highly motile structure at the distal end of the growing axon (9Gordon-Weeks P.R.

This information is translated into a coordinated assembly of cytoskeletal proteins that comprise microtubules and actin filaments. It is believed that cross-talk between the actin filaments and microtubules is a requisite for axonal outgrowth (9Gordon-Weeks P.R. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Challacombe J.F. Snow D.M. Letourneau P.C. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3085-3095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lin C.H. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1369-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). It is suggested that dynamic actin filaments allow the enhanced transport and/or polymerization of microtubules, thereby resulting in enhanced process elongation (12Bradke F. Dotti C.G. Science. 1999; 283: 1931-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Therefore, dynamic properties of microtubules, which are regulated by diverse cellular factors, appear to be important for the regulation of axon elongation. CRMP-2 has emerged as one of the crucial regulators of microtubule dynamics during the neurite/axonal growth (13Fukata Y. Itoh T.J. Kimura T. Menager C. Nishimura T. Shiromizu T. Watanabe H. Inagaki N. Iwamatsu A. Hotani H. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). CRMP-2, which has been independently identified as Ulip2, CRMP-62, TOAD-64, and DRP-2, is one of at least five isoforms. CRMP-2 binds to tubulin heterodimers and promotes microtubule assembly (13Fukata Y. Itoh T.J. Kimura T. Menager C. Nishimura T. Shiromizu T. Watanabe H. Inagaki N. Iwamatsu A. Hotani H. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The overexpression of CRMP-2 facilitates the rate of axonal growth, whereas the mutated form that lacks activity toward the microtubule assembly inhibits axonal growth in a dominant negative manner (14Inagaki N. Chihara K. Arimura N. Menager C. Kawano Y. Matsuo N. Nishimura T. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 781-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suggested that CRMP-2-tubulin complexes that are concentrated in the distal part of the axon modulate microtubule assembly and, thereby, contribute to the axonal growth. Here, we report here that MAG-Fc or Nogo-66 induces phosphorylation of CRMP-2 in postnatal cerebellar neurons. Ectopic expression of the wild-type or the nonphosphorylated forms of CRMP-2 abolishes the effect of these inhibitors on the neurons. Consistent with the function of CRMP-2, microtubule levels are down-regulated in the neurites in vitro by MAG-Fc and in the axons in vivo following spinal cord injury. Cell Culture—Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were removed from P6–10 rats and dissociated into single cells by incubation and trituration with 0.025% trypsin (Sigma) for 5 min at 37 °C. For cerebellar neurons, the cerebella from two rats (P7) were combined in 5 ml of 0.025% trypsin, triturated, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added, and the cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm. Neurons were plated in Sato media (15Doherty P. Fruns M. Seaton P. Dickson G. Barton C.H. Sears T.A. Walsh F.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 464-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) on poly-l-lysine-coated chamber slides. For outgrowth assays, plated cells were incubated for 24 h, fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and immunostained with a monoclonal antibody (TuJ1) recognizing the neuron-specific β-tubulin III protein. Then, the length of the longest neurite or the total process outgrowth for each β-tubulin III-positive neuron was determined. Where indicated, IgG-Fc (25 μg/ml, Athens Research and Technology), MAG-Fc (25 μg/ml), or glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused protein of Nogo-66 was added to the medium after plating. Myc-tagged CRMP-2 plasmid, the deletion form of CRMP-2 plasmid (14Inagaki N. Chihara K. Arimura N. Menager C. Kawano Y. Matsuo N. Nishimura T. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 781-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and the mutant CRMP-2 T555A (Thr-555 was replaced with Ala-555) (16Arimura N. Inagaki N. Chihara K. Menager C. Nakamura N.

CRMP-2 siRNA (5′-ACTCCTTCCTCGTGTACAT-3′ (31Domeniconi M. Cao Z. Spencer T. Sivasankaran R. Wang K. Nikulina E. Kimura N. Cai H. Deng K. Gao Y. He Z. Filbin M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 283-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar)) and a scramble siRNA (5′-CAGTCGCGTTTGCGACTGG-3′), as a control, were synthesized by Japan Bio Service (Saitama, Japan). Transfection of plasmids or siRNA in primary culture was performed after 12-h incubation employing nucleofection reagent (Amaxa, Koln, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, the cells were replated and incubated for an additional 24 h. To determine the transfected cells, cells were permeabilized and immunostained with the anti-Myc antibody (1:1000, Sigma) or polyclonal anti-CRMP-2 antibody (1:500). Where indicated, 10 μm Y27632 (Calbiochem) or Fasudil (provided by Asahi Kasei) was added to the cultures. Western Blot Analysis—Cells grown in 3.5-cm tissue culture dishes were collected in cold PBS by gentle scraping, washed three times, and then resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), followed by rocking for 10 min at 4 °C. After a 15-min centrifugation, the lysates were normalized for protein concentration using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Equal amounts of protein were then boiled in sample buffer for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes were blotted overnight with polyclonal anti-phospho CRMP-2 antibody (16Arimura N. Inagaki N. Chihara K. Menager C. Nakamura N. Amano M. Iwamatsu A. Goshima Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23973-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) (1:1000), polyclonal anti-CRMP-2 antibody (1:1000), polyclonal anti-phospho-cofilin antibody (1:1000, Chemicon), polyclonal anti-cofilin antibody (1:1000, Chemicon), polyclonal anti-phospho-MLC antibody (1:50), polyclonal anti-MLC antibody (1:300), polyclonal anti-Glu-tubulin antibody (1:1000, Chemicon), or anti-β-tubulin III antibody (1:1000, Covance). For detection, an ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) were used. Immunofluorescence—To extract soluble cytoplasmic proteins before staining, neurons were fixed and extracted for 30 min in a solution containing 0.1 m phosphate buffer (PB), 10 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2 (pH 6.9), as well as 4% paraformaldehyde, and 0.2% Triton X-100. For other immunostaining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PB for 30 min. Fixed neurons were washed with PBS and incubated in PBS containing 5% fetal calf serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min to block nonspecific antibody binding. Both primary antibodies and secondary antibodies were diluted with the blocking buffer. Microtubules were stained with anti-β-tubulin III antibody. Neurons were viewed with an inverted light microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics and a dry condenser for phase-contrast optics. To quantify fluorescence, cells were imaged using fixed exposure time and camera settings in each experiment. In Situ Rho GTPase Activity Assay—The construct consisting of the Rho GTPase binding domain of Rhotekin (nucleotides 609–857) fused with GST in the pGEX vector (RBD-GST) was kindly provided by Dr. M. A. Schwartz. In situ Rho GTPase activity assay using recombinant RBD-GST was performed as described previously (17Li Z. Aizenman C.D. Cline H.T. Neuron. 2002; 33: 741-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Animals were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PB (pH 7.4) at room temperature, and the spinal cords were then dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PB for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed in PBS. Cryostat sections (20 μm) taken from the rostral and caudal stump 10–15 mm from the transection site were incubated with blocking solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation with RBD-GST (15 μg/ml) at 4 °C overnight. After rinsing, sections were fixed again in 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PB for 10 min at room temperature, and rinsed again. To quantify the spatial distribution of RhoA, sections were double stained with an anti-neurofilament antibody (1:200, Chemicon) in combination with an anti-GST monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:100 in blocking solution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C overnight. For cultured neurons, the cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and were incubated with the anti-GST monoclonal antibody and the anti-neurofilament antibody. Fluorescence-conjugated antibodies (diluted 1:1000) were used as the secondary antibodies. Affinity Precipitation of the GTP-bound Form of RhoA—Rat spinal cords were removed and sonicated on ice in the short bursts in the lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, with leupeptin and aprotinin, each at 10 μg/ml. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatants were incubated with the 20 μg of GST-Rho binding domain of Rhotekin beads (Upstate Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed four times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). Bound Rho proteins were detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Image Analysis and Statistics—For quantification of CRMP-2 siRNA effects on the level of endogenous proteins in transfected neurons, cell images were collected using identical intensity settings. Fluorescence intensity of transfected cells and nontransfected cells was measured. Data are presented as CRMP-2 fluorescence of the cell normalized to fluorescence of nontransfected cells. We regarded efficient knockdown of CRMP-2 when the threshold was <20%. To quantify polymerized microtubules in the axon, neurons under various conditions were fixed and extracted at the same time and stained with an anti-β-tubulin III antibody. Fluorescence images were taken with a 20× objective. The distal region of the axon ∼50 μm long was selected for microtubule density measurement according to the method described by He et al. (18He Y. Yu W. Baas P.W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5982-5991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the total fluorescence intensity of the selected axon segment was measured. The background measurement was then subtracted to obtain the adjusted total fluorescence intensity. The final results were represented as average fluorescence intensity per micron length of axon. To analyze Glu-tubulin distribution in the axons, we measured length of Glu-tubulin-positive fibers in each section of the spinal cords. The area of corticospinal tract in the rostral stump, ∼3–6 mm rostrally from the injury site, was studied. Double immunohistochemical analysis showed that the fibers shorter than 25 μm were negative for neuron-specific β-tubulin III, demonstrating that they were not neurons, whereas the fibers longer than 25 μm were positive for neuron-specific β-tubulin III. As the focus of our study was to analyze Glu-tubulin in the axons, we measured average length of a subset of fibers. The average length was calculated, and data are normalized to the percent control. The statistical analysis was done by t test. All data were reported as mean ± S.E., and we used an unpaired Student's t test to determine the significance of the data between groups. “n” indicates the number of independent experiments. For multiple group comparison, one-way ANOVA was used, followed by t test as post hoc analysis. Surgical Procedure—Rats were anesthetized under 2% halothane. Adult female Wistar rats (250–300 g) received a laminectomy at vertebral level T9/10, and the spinal cord was exposed. A no. 11 blade was used for total section of the spinal cord, and a part of the spinal cord of 10–15 mm in length was removed. A small piece of gel foam, soaked in 10 μl of 1 mg/ml Y-27632 (Calbiochem) dissolved in PBS or of PBS by itself, was implanted into the wound cavity, and the muscle and skin layers were sutured. Histological examination revealed that these lesions sever all fibers in the spinal cord. Tissue Preparation and Immunohistochemistry—For immunohistochemistry, fresh frozen tissues were obtained from an uninjured spinal cord and from ones at 0, 30 min, 2 h, and 12 h after injury. After deep anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital, the rats were decapitated and the spinal cords were dissected out, embedded in Tissue Tek OCT, and immediately frozen on dry ice at –80 °C. A series of parasagittal sections was cut at 20 μm on a cryostat and mounted on APS-coating Superfrost-Plus slides (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan). The sections were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and blocked in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. To extract soluble cytoplasmic proteins before staining, the sections were fixed and extracted for 1 h in a solution containing 0.1 m PB, 10 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2 (pH 6.9), as well as 4% paraformaldehyde, and 0.2% Triton X-100. The sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and washed three times with PBS, followed by incubation with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000, Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Monoclonal antibody (TuJ1) recognizing the neuron-specific β-tubulin III protein (1:1000, Covance), polyclonal anti-Glu-tubulin antibody (1:500, Chemicon), anti-neurofilament antibody (1:200, Chemicon), or polyclonal anti-CRMP-2 antibody was used as the primary antibody. Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) was used to label the F-actin structure. Samples were examined under a fluorescence microscope. Control experiments of immunocytochemistry were performed by leaving out the primary antibodies. Phosphorylation of CRMP-2 Is Induced by Nogo-66 and MAG-Fc—The neurite outgrowth of the postnatal cerebellar granule neurons or dorsal root ganglion neurons is inhibited in vitro by MAG or Nogo-66. This effect depends on the activation of RhoA and Rho-kinase through p75 (4Yamashita T. Higuchi H. Tohyama M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To explore the signal transduction of MAG or Nogo-66, we focused on CRMP-2, because CRMP-2 is phosphorylated at Thr-555 and inactivated by Rho-kinase in response to lysophosphatic acid (16Arimura N. Inagaki N. Chihara K. Menager C. Nakamura N. Amano M. Iwamatsu A. Goshima Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23973-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To examine whether Nogo-66 induces phosphorylation of CRMP-2, we employed the cerebellar neurons from postnatal days 7 (P7) rats. These neurons expressed abundant levels of CRMP-2 in vitro as assessed by Western blot (Fig. 1A, second panel) and are responsive to MAG as well as Nogo-66 (4Yamashita T. Higuchi H. Tohyama M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 7Yamashita T. Tohyama M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). We then treated the cultured cells for 10 min with the GST-Nogo-66 protein, which is a fusion protein corresponding to the extracellular fragment of Nogo (10–300 nm) (19Fournier A.E. GrandPre T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar), and assessed the phosphorylation state by the antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated CRMP-2 at Thr-555 (16Arimura N. Inagaki N. Chihara K. Menager C. Nakamura N. Amano M. Iwamatsu A. Goshima Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23973-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The addition of Nogo-66 resulted in a significant dose-dependent phosphorylation of CRMP-2 (Fig. 1A). The enhancement of phosphorylation was observed within 10 min (Fig. 1, B and C). This phosphorylation of CRMP-2 is Rho-kinase dependent, because the inhibitors of Rho-kinase-Y-27632 and Fasudil attenuated the phosphorylation of CRMP-2 (Fig. 1D). Additionally, MAG-Fc at a concentration of 15 μg/ml significantly up-regulated the phosphorylation level of CRMP-2 at 30 min (Fig. 1E). Time-course experiments show that the phosphorylation level was enhanced at least until 60 min after the addition of MAG-Fc (Fig. 1, F and G). These results demonstrate that MAG and Nogo-66 induce phosphorylation of CRMP-2 by a Rho-kinase-dependent mechanism in the postnatal cerebellar neurons. Rho-kinase phosphorylates various substrates. For example, Rhokinase directly phosphorylates myosin light chain (MLC) (20Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar), and the phosphorylated MLC induces contraction of the actomyosin filaments and retraction of the neurites (21Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, we did not detect changes in the phosphorylation state of MLC in these neurons by the GST-Nogo-66 (Fig. 1A) and MAG-Fc treatments (Fig. 1F). We next focused on the molecule LIM kinase, which is activated by Rho-kinase as well as by p21-activated kinase. In mammalian cells, LIM kinase phosphorylates cofilin, which is an actin depolymerization factor, at Ser-3 (22Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Cofilin is essential for axon growth in Drosophila neurons (23Ng J. Luo L. Neuron. 2004; 44: 779-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, both GST-Nogo-66 (Fig. 1A) and MAG-Fc (Fig. 1F) did not induce phosphorylation of cofilin at Ser-3 in the cerebellar neurons. We did not observe any significant increase in the phosphorylation state during a period from 1 min to 2 h (data not shown). These data suggest the important role of CRMP-2 in the MAG or Nogo-66-mediated neurite inhibition. CRMP-2 Abolishes the Effect of MAG-Fc—Because the phosphorylation of CRMP-2 by Rho-kinase prevents the association of CRMP-2 with tubulin dimer (16Arimura N. Inagaki N. Chihara K. Menager C. Nakamura N. Amano M. Iwamatsu A. Goshima Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23973-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), the Nogo and the MAG signals appear to have a negative effect on the CRMP-2 function. Thus, the next hypothesis that we tested was whether the inactivation of CRMP-2 is involved in the effect of Nogo-66 and MAG in the neurons; we employed the neurite growth assay to test this. GST-Nogo-66 (100 nm, data not shown) or MAG-Fc (25 μg/ml) inhibited the neurite outgrowth of the cerebellar neurons from the P7 rats (Fig. 2, A and B), as previously reported (7Yamashita T. Tohyama M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The same results were obtained irrespective of whether total process outgrowth or length of the longest neurite was measured (data not shown). We transfected cerebellar neurons with Myc-tagged wild-type CRMP-2 (14Inagaki N. Chihara K. Arimura N. Menager C. Kawano Y. Matsuo N. Nishimura T. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 781-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) when the plated cells initiated the growth of neurites and found that the overexpression of CRMP-2 dramatically facilitated the neurite outgrowth (Fig. 2, A and B). However, GST-Nogo-66 (data not shown) or MAG-Fc did not significantly inhibit the neurite outgrowth of the neurons that overexpressed the wild-type CRMP-2. CRMP-2 is phosphorylated at Thr-555 by Rho-kinase (16Arimura N. Inagaki N. Chihara K. Menager C. Nakamura N. Amano M. Iwamatsu A. Goshima Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23973-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We then transfected the cells with a CRMP-2 in which Thr-555 was replaced by Ala (T555A). However, we did not observe any significant promotion of neurite outgrowth by the CRMP-2 T555A expression (Fig. 2, A and B). The difference in the neurite promotion effect between the wild-type CRMP-2 and CRMP-2 T555A might be due to the difference in the expression level, because the expression of CRMP-2 T555A was significantly lower than that of the wild-type CRMP-2 (Fig. 2C). Additionally, MAG-Fc did not significantly inhibit the neurite outgrowth of the neurons that ectopically expressed CRMP-2 T555A (Fig. 2, A and B). The ectopic expression of the deletion form of CRMP-2, which lacks activity toward the microtubule assembly and acts as a dominant negative form (14Inagaki N. Chihara K. Arimura N. Menager C. Kawano Y. Matsuo N. Nishimura T. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 781-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), mimicked the effect of GST-Nogo-66 or MAG-Fc (Fig. 2, A and B). We then used RNA interference to test whether CRMP-2 is required for neurite elongation. The knock down of CRMP-2 expression by siRNA (24Nishimura T. Fukata Y. Kato K. Yamaguchi T. Matsuura Y. Kamiguchi H. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) resulted in the inhibition of neurite outgrowth, whereas scrambled siRNA showed no effect (Fig. 2, A and B). As we transfected the cells with the plasmids or siRNA after establishing the cell polarity (these cells had tau-positive axons), the effect we observed was neurite elongation and not axonal formation. These results suggest that the inactivation of CRMP-2 downstream of Rho-kinase is involved in the inhibitory effect of MAG or Nogo-66 on neurite elongation, although we could not rule out the possibility that overexpression of CRMP-2 counteracts other signaling pathways downstream of MAG or Nogo-66, thus abolishing the effect. Regulation of Neurite Microtubule Levels through the Rho-kinase Pathway—Accumulated evidence indicates that axon growth involves the regulation of axonal microtubules (25Arimura N. Menager C. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Inactivation of CRMP-2 by MAG-Fc or GST-Nogo-66 presumably results in the inhibition of microtubule assembly. To directly visualize microtubule polymers in the neurites, we extracted and fixed the neurons simultaneously to eliminate tubulin monomers and then stained for polymerized microtubules,"
https://openalex.org/W2093024719,"Hyaluronan synthases (HASs) are plasma membrane enzymes that simultaneously elongate, bind, and extrude the growing hyaluronan chain directly into extracellular space. In cells transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Has3, the dorsal surface was decorated by up to 150 slender, 3–20-μm-long microvillus-type plasma membrane protrusions, which also contained filamentous actin, the hyaluronan receptor CD44, and lipid raft microdomains. Enzymatic activity of HAS was required for the growth of the microvilli, which were not present in cells transfected with other GFP proteins or inactive GFP-Has3 mutants or in cells incubated with exogenous soluble hyaluronan. The microvilli induced by HAS3 were gradually withered by introduction of an inhibitor of hyaluronan synthesis and rapidly retracted by hyaluronidase digestion, whereas they were not affected by competition with hyaluronan oligosaccharides and disruption of the CD44 gene, suggesting independence of hyaluronan receptors. The data bring out the novel concept that the glycocalyx created by dense arrays of hyaluronan chains, tethered to HAS during biosynthesis, can induce and maintain prominent microvilli.

Vertebrate cells display slender plasma membrane protrusions like filopodia, microspikes, and microvilli, the formation and maintenance of which are thought to depend on the dynamics of a bundle of actin filaments in the core of these extensions (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar). In selected environments, most of the components in the actin polymerization apparatus, when overexpressed or experimentally activated, have been reported to increase the growth of filopodia or microvilli (2Loomis P.A.

This suggests that there is a strong intrinsic potential in cells to display these extensions, ready for implementation by factors even outside the effector and signaling chains directly related to actin. Indeed, at the molecular level, mechanisms that induce the growth of microvilli in vivo are still somewhat obscure (8D'Alterio C. Tran D.D. Yeung M.W. Hwang M.S. Li M.A. Arana C.J. Mulligan V.K.

We present a novel factor, active hyaluronan synthesis, apparently unrelated to any of the previously described signaling or actin polymerization processes, that triggers extensive microvillus formation in several cell types. Interestingly, the process is primarily driven by the cell surface glycocalyx rather than intracellular systems. Hyaluronan is an ubiquitous pericellular and extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan important in embryonic development (9Camenisch T.D. Schroeder J.A. Bradley J. Klewer S.E. McDonald J.A. Nat.

Some of its effects are thought to be mediated by an ability to form a hydrated pericellular matrix, a coat that can modify cellular interactions with other matrix components and neighboring cells, directly regulating processes such as differentiation and migration (20Toole B.P. Wight T.N. Tammi M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4593-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Some of the biological signals elicited by hyaluronan are dependent on its CD44 receptor on cell surfaces (21Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), whereas some of the signals have not been directly connected to any receptor or interacting molecule (9Camenisch T.D.

Hyaluronan synthases (HAS1, HAS2, HAS3) 3The abbreviations used are: HAS, hyaluronan synthase; bHABC, biotinylated hyaluronan binding complex; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SEM, scanning electron microscopy, TEM, transmission electron microscopy; RHAMM, receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; TRU, turbidity-reducing units. are a family of vertebrate plasma membrane enzymes synthesizing hyaluronan. They are integral membrane proteins that catalyze the alternate addition of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine from their UDP derivatives to a growing hyaluronan polymer, continuously translocated through the plasma membrane into extracellular matrix (22Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) and eventually reaching a molecular mass up to 107 Da (23Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. FASEB. J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar). There are distant homologues of the vertebrate HAS also in Streptococcus and Pasteurella bacteria (24Weigel P.H. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All vertebrate HAS isoenzymes are apparently synthesized into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and transported through Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane (25Müllegger J. Rustom A. Kreil G. Gerdes H.H. Lepperdinger G. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Rilla K. Siiskonen H. Spicer A.P. Hyttinen J.M. Tammi M.I. Tammi R.H. J. Biol.

DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39832-39835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, Streptococcus HAS binds several cardiolipin molecules to reach maximal activity (28Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but no such essential lipid has been found for vertebrate HAS (29Yoshida M. Itano N. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 497-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Despite the apparently missing protein or lipid interactions that could aid in vertebrate HAS targeting to a specific membrane domain, Xenopus green fluorescent protein Has1 fusion protein (GFP-Has1) transfected into oocytes accumulates at some uncharacterized sites on the plasma membrane (25Müllegger J. Rustom A. Kreil G. Gerdes H.H. Lepperdinger G. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In our recent study on GFP-labeled murine Has2 and Has3 transfected into epidermal keratinocytes, it turned out that the plasma membrane domains particularly enriched in HAS were cell surface protrusions (26Rilla K.

In this study, we show that HAS not only seeks its way to existing cell surface protrusions but actually creates specific microvilli up to 20 μm tall on several cell types. The induction and maintenance of these microvilli are completely dependent on an ongoing synthesis of hyaluronan by HAS, most concentrated in these structures. Cell Culture—The human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, MCF-7, was cultured in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland, UK) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria), 2 mm glutamine (Sigma) and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and 50 units/ml penicillin (Sigma). Cells were passaged twice a week at a 1:5 split ratio using 0.05% trypsin (w/v) in 0.02% EDTA (w/v) (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). The SKOV-3 human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium with 10% FBS (Euroclone, Milan, Italy), and glutamine and antibiotics as above. Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial (MDCK) cells (from Dr. Donald MacCallum, Ann Arbor, MI) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose (Euroclone) supplemented with 10% FBS, glutamine, and the antibiotics. Rat epidermal keratinocytes were cultured in minimum essential medium (Euroclone) supplemented with 5% FBS, glutamine, and the antibiotics. Primary mouse epidermal keratinocytes were isolated and cultured as described by Hager et al. (30Hager B. Bickenbach J.R. Fleckman P. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 971-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Skin was obtained from newborn wild type (C57Bl/6) and CD44–/– mice (obtained from Dr. Paul Noble, West Haven, CT and originally developed by Dr. Tak Mak, Toronto, Canada). The Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Kuopio approved the study protocol. Epidermis and dermis were separated with Dispase (type II, Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), and the cells were released from the tissues with a brief treatment of 0.05% trypsin in 0.02%-EDTA. The keratinocytes were suspended in medium and plated at 50,000 cells/well on 8-well chambered cover glass slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) coated with 1 μg/cm2 of type IV collagen (BD Biosciences). This medium contains Eagle's minimum essential medium (BioWhittaker, no calcium) supplemented with 0.06 mm Ca2+, 8% FBS (HyClone, Logan, UT) treated with Chelex (Bio-Rad), 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone (hydrocortisone hemisuccinate, Sigma), 0.75 mm aminoguanidine nitrate (Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), 2 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma), 10–10 m cholera toxin (Sigma), and 3T3-fibroblast conditioned medium (1:1). HaCat cells were a kind gift from Dr. Norbert Fusenig (Heidelberg, Germany). They were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% FBS (PAA Laboratories). For passaging, the cells were treated with EDTA (0.02% in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, Sigma) for 5 min and then with 0.05% trypsin in 0.02% EDTA (Biochrom) for 10 min. The cells were maintained by plating at a 1:10 split ratio twice a week. Transfections—Subconfluent cell cultures were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Transfected constructs were mouse Has3 cDNA in-frame with an N-terminal GFP fusion protein in the pCIneo vector (31Spicer A.P. Nguyen T.K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), GFP alone in the pCIneo vector (31Spicer A.P. Nguyen T.K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), GFP-Has3 pCIneo with a D216A targeted mutation (31Spicer A.P. Nguyen T.K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and human taurine transporter (Hannu Karjalainen, University of Kuopio, Department of Anatomy) in EGFP-N1 vector (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were examined 16–48 h after transfections. Culture medium was collected and subjected for hyaluronan enzyme-linked sorbent assay 48 h after transfection. Treatments of the Cultures—0.2 mg/ml HA6 or HA10 oligosaccharides (Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan) were added to live MCF-7 cells after or during transfection. Streptomyces hyaluronidase (2.5–10 TRU/ml, Seikagaku Kogyo Co.), 4-methylumbelliferone (1 mm, Sigma), or brefeldin A (5 μg/ml, Sigma) were added to living cell cultures a day after transfection. Non-transfected MCF-7 cells were treated with high molecular mass hyaluronan (AmVisc™plus, Chiron Vision, Lyon, France) overnight, fixed, and stained for lipid raft microdomains as described below. Microtubules in MCF-7 cells overexpressing HAS3 were removed by 30 min of incubation on ice followed by nocodazole (63 mm, Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. GFP-Has3-transfected MCF-7 cells were treated with 5 μg/ml latrunculin B (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 2 h at 37 °C, fixed, and stained with phalloidin as described below. Hermes 1 (a partly blocking antibody for CD44, 5 μg/ml), was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, developed under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health, and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City) (32Jalkanen S.T. Bargatze R.F. Herron L.R. Butcher E.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1986; 16: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The R36 antibody (blocking antibody for receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM), 20 μg/ml) was a gift from Dr. Rashmin Savani, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA. Cholesterol was depleted in the transfected MCF-7 cells by treating the cells with 1% methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma) for 30 min-2 h. Assay of Hyaluronan—A subconfluent MCF-7 cell culture on 24-well plates was transfected with GFP-Has3, changed next day to a fresh medium (with 5% FBS), and cultured for 24 h before counting the cells and harvesting the medium for the enzyme-linked sorbent assay of hyaluronan as described previously (33Karvinen S. Pasonen-Seppanen S. Hyttinen J.M. Pienimaki J.P. Torronen K. Jokela T.A. Tammi M.I. Tammi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49495-49504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Red Blood Cell Exclusion Assay—Fixed sheep red blood cells (Sigma) were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, washed, and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Aliquots of the suspension were added to a cell culture and allowed to settle at least for 15 min at 37 °C before microscopy. Localization of Hyaluronan—For the light microscopic detection of hyaluronan, cells were seeded on collagen type I precoated 8-well chambered cover glasses and transfected as described above. The slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, permeabilized, and probed with 2 μg/ml biotinylated hyaluronan binding complex (bHABC) as described previously (26Rilla K. Siiskonen H.

For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the GFP-transfected cells were fixed and stained for hyaluronan as described previously (34Tammi R. Rilla K. Pienimäki J.P. MacCallum D.K. Hogg M. Luukkonen M. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35111-35122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The cells were permeabilized using 0.05% saponin in all incubation buffers and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml bHABC followed by 2 h with streptavidin peroxidase and 20 min with 0.03% 3,3′-diaminobezidine (Sigma) containing 0.03% H2O2. After postfixation with reduced osmium tetroxide, the cells were dehydrated and embedded in Spurr's resin. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and viewed using a JEOL 1200 EX microscope. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)—For SEM, cells were grown and transfected on 13-mm coverslips. After 48 h, the cultures were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature and dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol. After critical point drying, cells were shadowed with gold and photographed on an XL30 TMP environmental SEM (FEI Company, the Netherlands) at 15 kV. Immunofluorescence Stainings—For the staining of CD44, actin cytoskeleton, microtubules, and lipid rafts, transfected MCF-7 cells were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked as described above and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody (Hermes 3, 1:100, a generous gift from Dr. Sirpa Jalkanen, Turku, Finland) or anti-β-tubulin (1:500, Roche Applied Science) in 1% bovine serum albumin. After washing, the cells were incubated for 1 h with Texas Red-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector, 1:500). For the visualization of the actin filaments, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor® 594 phalloidin (5 units/ml, Molecular Probes) for 1 h. Lipid raft microdomains at plasma membrane were visualized by a Vybrant® lipid raft labeling kit (Molecular Probes). Confocal Imaging—The micrographs were obtained with an Ultraview® confocal scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Wallac-LSR, Oxford, UK) on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope with a 60 × NA 1.4 and 100 × NA 1.3 oil immersion objectives. For the live cell imaging, the microscope was equipped with a Micro-Incubator (model CSMI, Harvard Apparatus, Digitimer Ltd., Hetfordshire, UK) to maintain 37 °C and 5% CO2. The three-dimensional imaging and image modification were performed as described previously (26Rilla K. Siiskonen H. Spicer A.P. Hyttinen J.M. Tammi M.I. Tammi R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31890-31897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Supplemental Movies—Movie 1 shows an MCF-7 cell expressing GFP-HAS3 fusion protein as a compressed image of horizontal stacks. The stacks were collected every 20 s for a total time of 20 min. Movie 2 represents two MCF-7 cells expressing GFP-HAS3 fusion protein shown as a compressed image of horizontal stacks. 2.5 TRU/ml Streptomyces hyaluronidase was added 3 min before the start of stack collection. The stacks were collected at 10-s intervals for a total time of 17 min. Note the rapid retraction of the microvilli 10 min after the addition of hyaluronidase. Both videos play at 5 frames/s. GFP-Has3 Transfection Causes a Major Induction of Hyaluronan Synthesis in MCF-7 Cells—Since hyaluronan has been shown to enhance potentially malignant cell properties, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, resistance to apoptosis, and multidrug resistance (14Toole B.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar), we started transient transfections of Has3 coupled to GFP into MCF-7, a relatively non-aggressive human breast cancer cell line, to investigate the effects of increased hyaluronan synthesis on the phenotype of these cells (35Li Y. Heldin P. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan synthesis was relatively low in the parent MCF-7 cells, whereas GFP-Has3 transfection increased the secretion of hyaluronan into culture medium up to 200 ng/10,000 cells/24 h, about 100-fold increase as compared with control cultures transfected with a vector containing a GFP protein alone (Table 1). The transfection efficiency was 20–50%, based on the estimation of brightly fluorescent cells 1 day after transfection.TABLE 1Hyaluronan concentration in the culture media of MCF-7 cells transfected with GFP and GFP-Has3TransfectionHyaluronan production over 24 h ng/10,000 cellsFold increaseNo transfection1.8 ± 0.41.0 ± 0.0GFP transfection2.6 ± 0.41.6 ± 0.3GFP-Has3 transfection193.5 ± 55.2122.0 ± 43.7 Open table in a new tab The cell-associated hyaluronan was also increased in GFP-Has3-transfected cells as indicated by the classical assay in which sedimented erythrocytes are excluded from a pericellular space occupied by hyaluronan (Fig. 1b). An exclusion space did not exist around cells transfected with a plasmid containing only GFP (Fig. 1a). The Hyaluronan Coat Contains GFP-HAS3-positive Cell Protrusions—Careful examination of the erythrocyte sedimentation assays revealed that the “empty” space representing the hyaluronan coat actually contained GFP-HAS3-positive cell protrusions (Fig. 1b). Similar villous protrusions were not present in MCF-7 cells transfected with GFP only (Fig. 1a). Hyaluronan was also increased, and microvilli were induced on cells transfected with a plasmid containing GFP-Has2 (data not shown). The maximum length of the microvilli was ∼20 μm, and the number of those longer than ∼3 μm ranged from a few to about 150/cell. Fixation of the cell cultures with aldehydes usually resulted in a considerable truncation of the microvilli and partial loss of the hyaluronan coat. However, even after fixation, standard staining with the bHABC and visualization by fluorescent streptavidin, microvilli, and a definite layer of hyaluronan were recognized on cells transfected with GFP-Has3 (Fig. 1d) but not on GFP-only cells (Fig. 1c). There was also a strong signal from intracellular GFP-HAS3, representing its traffic in the secretory pathway through the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, and endocytic vesicles (26Rilla K. Siiskonen H. Spicer A.P. Hyttinen J.M. Tammi M.I. Tammi R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31890-31897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The ultrastructure of the microvilli was studied in GFP-Has3-transfected MCF-7 cells stained for hyaluronan with the bHABC probe, visualized by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine precipitates, and observed by TEM (Fig. 1e). As in the confocal images, the transfected cells were associated with hyaluronan, visualized as the knob- and ribbon-like deposits on the microvilli (Fig. 1e). The TEM analysis showed that the microvilli were slender; their average diameter was ∼120 nm. As a consequence, the odds were very low that any longer stretch of microvillus would occur in the ∼70-nm-thick plane of the electron microscopy section. A more comprehensive view was obtained with SEM that revealed ∼130-nm-diameter microvilli (Fig. 1f). The microvilli were collapsed onto the cells, obviously due to the dehydration required for the visualization by gold sputtering on the cells. Cells (Fig. 1f, asterisk) and cultures not transfected with GFP-Has3 showed no such microvilli. The Microvilli Grow into Their Full Length in a Few Hours and Are Relatively Stable—To evaluate the growth rate of the microvilli, transfected cells were first treated with brefeldin A, which blocks the traffic of GFP-HAS3 from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and returns the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (26Rilla K. Siiskonen H. Spicer A.P. Hyttinen J.M. Tammi M.I. Tammi R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31890-31897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Time-lapse imaging of individual cells following removal of brefeldin A indicated that the first small microvilli emerged after 1.5–2 h (Fig. 2, a and b), corresponding to the time required for GFP-HAS3 to travel from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (26Rilla K. Siiskonen H. Spicer A.P. Hyttinen J.M. Tammi M.I. Tammi R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31890-31897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The number and height of the microvilli gradually increased up to 4–5 h after removal of the brefeldin A block and then remained at that state (Fig. 2). Individual microvilli were relatively stable as suggested by time-lapse imaging for shorter, 5–15-min periods (Supplemental Movie 1). The Microvilli Arise in Several Cell Types Transfected with GFP-Has—The expression of GFP-Has3 resulted in a “hedgehog” appearance in all epithelial cell types studied so far, including SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 3, a and b), MDCK kidney epithelial cells (Fig. 3, c and d) and rat (rat epidermal keratinocytes), human (HaCaT), and mouse primary keratinocytes, suggesting that their induction by GFP-HAS3 is ubiquitous. The appearance rate of the microvilli was somewhat slower in MDCK cells as compared with the ovarian or breast cancer cell lines, but 48 h after transfections, these protrusions were present in all these cell types. The GFP-HAS3 Induced Microvilli Are Supported by Actin Filaments—Even in the partially truncated structures resulting from fixation and staining with phalloidin, it was obvious that filamentous actin was present in the core of the microvilli (Fig. 4, b and c), whereas they showed no signal with an antibody against β-tubulin (data not shown). Accordingly, treatment with latrunculin B to degrade actin filaments destroyed the microvilli (Fig. 4d) and eventually detached the cells. In contrast, nocodazole that disrupts microtubules had no effect on microvilli or cell morphology (data not shown). These results indicate that the microvilli largely rested on actin filaments. Immunostaining for lipid raft microdomains utilizing cholera toxin subunit B showed their widespread distribution on MCF-7 cells, but the signal was particularly prominent in the microvilli (Fig. 5b). There was a partial colocalization between GFP-HAS3 (Fig. 5a) and the lipid raft staining, both in the microvilli and in the cell body (Fig. 5c). Introduction of methyl-β-cyclodextrin, an agent that abducts cholesterol from the cell, resulted in the disappearance of the microvilli (Fig. 5d). These data suggest that cholesterol, probably associated with the lipid raft material, is vital for the maintenance of the microvilli. The Microvilli Are Created and Maintained by Active Hyaluronan Synthesis—To distinguish between the alternatives that the microvillus formation was triggered specifically by the GFP-HAS3 protein or any GFP-tagged membrane protein, we transfected into MCF-7 cells a GFP-labeled taurine transporter, which is also inserted into the plasma membrane. The GFP-taurine transporter appeared to label all plasma membranes, including cell protrusions (Fig. 6, c and d). However, the protrusions visualized by taurine transporter were often branched, were variable in thickness, and were lying on the lateral aspect of the cell, (Fig. 6, c and d), whereas the HAS-dependent microvilli were unbranched, mostly projected up from the dorsal side of the cell, and typically contained a knob at the tip (Fig. 6, a and b). To reveal whether the HAS protein or the hyaluronan synthesized by HAS was responsible for the induction of the microvilli, a missense (D216A) mutation was introduced into the active center of GFP-HAS3. No microvilli were found in cells transfected with this enzymatically inactive mutant (Fig. 6, e and f). Likewise, enzymatically inactive GFP-HAS3 proteins with short C-terminal truncations did not support microvillus formation (data not shown). Depletion of the UDP-glucuronic acid precursor pool by 4-methylumbelliferone severely inhibits hyaluronan synthesis in some cell types (26Ril"

Hot and cold substances applied to teeth usually elicit pain sensation. This study investigated the expression of thermo-TRP channels in dental primary afferent neurons of the rat identified by retrograde labeling with a fluorescent dye in maxillary molars. Single cell reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry revealed expression of TRPV1, TRPM8, and TRPA1 in subsets of such neurons. Capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist), menthol (a TRPM8 agonist), and icilin (a TRPM8 and TRPA1 agonist) increased intracellular calcium and evoked cationic currents in subsets of neurons, as did the appropriate temperature changes (>43 °, <25 °, and <17 °C, respectively). Some neurons expressed more than one TRP channel and responded to two or three corresponding stimuli (ligands or thermal stimuli). Immunohistochemistry and single cell reverse transcription-PCR following whole cell recordings provided direct evidence for the association between the responsiveness to thermo-TRP ligands and expression of thermo-TRP channels. The results suggest that activation of thermo-TRP channels expressed by dental afferent neurons contributes to tooth pain evoked by temperature stimuli. Accordingly, blockade of thermo-TRP channels will provide a novel therapeutic intervention for the treatment of tooth pain.

Capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist), menthol (a TRPM8 agonist), and icilin (a TRPM8 and TRPA1 agonist) increased intracellular calcium and evoked cationic currents in subsets of neurons, as did the appropriate temperature changes (>43 °, <25 °, and <17 °C, respectively). Some neurons expressed more than one TRP channel and responded to two or three corresponding stimuli (ligands or thermal stimuli). Immunohistochemistry and single cell reverse transcription-PCR following whole cell recordings provided direct evidence for the association between the responsiveness to thermo-TRP ligands and expression of thermo-TRP channels. The results suggest that activation of thermo-TRP channels expressed by dental afferent neurons contributes to tooth pain evoked by temperature stimuli. Accordingly, blockade of thermo-TRP channels will provide a novel therapeutic intervention for the treatment of tooth pain. Recent studies have demonstrated that subfamilies of TRP 2The abbreviations used are: TRP, transient receptor potential; thermo-TRPs, temperature-activated transient receptor potential channels; IB4, isolectin B4; RT, reverse transcription; TG, trigeminal ganglion; DiI, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate. channels play critical roles in the transduction of temperature and pain sensation (1Patapoutian A. Peier A.M. Story G.M. Viswanath V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The temperature-activated TRP channels (thermo-TRP channels) include TRPV1, TRPM8, and TRPA1; they are activated by >43 °, <25 °, and <17 °C, respectively (1Patapoutian A. Peier A.M. Story G.M. Viswanath V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). They can also be activated by the exogenous ligands, capsaicin (TRPV1), menthol (TRPM8), and icilin (TRPM8 and TRPA1) (2Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D.

Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). Given that the thermo-TRPs are involved in converting thermal information into electrical signals within the sensory nervous system (1Patapoutian A. Peier A.M. Story G.M. Viswanath V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), it is possible that thermo-TRPs expressed by dental primary afferents play a crucial role for transduction process of tooth pain, especially caused by noxious thermal stimulation. The different forms of pain are produced by distinctive molecular and cellular mechanisms. It is now thought that elucidation of the main mechanism involved in a certain form of pain is key to the development of pain treatments, which specifically target underlying the cause rather than just symptoms (6Scholz J. Woolf C.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Tooth pain is commonly induced by the presence of hot or cold foods in the oral cavity (7Pashley D.H. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1996; 7: 104-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8Nair P.N. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol. Oral Radiol.

Pain. 1993; 55: 159-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Tooth pain results from the exposure of dentin, which is caused by dissolution of the protective enamel covering the tooth crown by dental caries or gingival recession (7Pashley D.H. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1996; 7: 104-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8Nair P.N. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol. Oral Radiol. Endod. 1995; 80: 710-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Since the proposition of Brännström, arguing that the fluid movement in dentinal tubules induced by diverse stimuli, including thermal stimuli, elicits tooth nerve firing to produce tooth pain (referred to as the hydrodynamic hypothesis) (10Brannstrom M. Linden L.A. Astrom A. Caries Res. 1967; 1: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 11Brannstrom M. Astrom A. Int. Dent. J. 1972; 22: 219-227PubMed Google Scholar), much evidence has been reported to support the hypothesis (12Andrew D. Matthews B. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, it is not fully understood yet how such temperature changes are perceived as painful by the teeth, given that tooth afferents are generally considered to be purely nociceptive. We hypothesized that this is mediated by thermo-TRP channels (1Patapoutian A. Peier A.M. Story G.M. Viswanath V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 13Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 14Moran M.M. Xu H. Clapham D.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In the present experiments we identified dental afferent neurons dissociated from the trigeminal ganglion of rats, by previously applying a fluorescent dye to the exposed dentin of molar teeth. The neurons were classified by size and expression of NaV1.8- and the isolectin B4 (IB4)-binding protein. We found evidence for expression of TRPV1, TRPM8, and TRPA1 in these neurons by measuring mRNA level through single cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, by immunohistochemistry, and by measuring inward currents or changes in intracellular calcium in response to the appropriate ligands or temperature changes. The results indicate that TRP channels could be responsible for the transduction of heat and cold stimuli into the sensation of pain. All surgical and experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in College of Dentistry, Seoul National University. Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN), weighing ∼160-180 g at the time of surgery, were housed at a temperature of 23 ± 2 °C with a 12-h light-dark cycle and fed food and water ad libitum. The animals were allowed to habituate to the housing facilities for 1 week before the experiments. Verification and Classification of Dental Primary Afferent Neurons— Dental primary afferent neurons were identified by retrograde labeling with a fluorescent dye (DiI, D-282, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (15Taddese A. Nah S.Y. McCleskey E.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1366-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Cook S.P. Vulchanova L. Hargreaves K.M. Elde R. McCleskey E.W.

Three weeks after the dye was placed in maxillary molars, trigeminal ganglion neurons were prepared (18Yang B.H. Piao Z.G. Kim Y.B. Lee C.H. Lee J.K. Park K. Kim J.S. Oh S.B. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 95% O2/5% CO2 at 37 °C; they were used for calcium imaging and whole cell recording within 6 and 8 h. DiI-labeled neurons were identified by fluorescence and were further classified by treatment immediately after the experiment with IB4 conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (10 μg/ml IB4-fluorescein isothiocyanate, Sigma) (19Stucky C.L. Lewin G.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6497-6505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IB4-positive neurons had an intense bright ring around the soma membrane (see Fig. 1A, panel f). Intracellular Calcium Imaging—Neurons were loaded with fura-2 AM (acetoxymethyl, 2 μm; Molecular Probes) for 40 min at 37 °C in a balanced salt solution (in mm: 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2,1MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose), followed by rinsing and incubation for 30 min to de-esterify the dye. The cells plated onto poly-l-ornithine-coated coverslips were mounted onto the chamber, which then was placed onto the inverted microscope (Olympus IX70, Japan) and perfused continuously by balanced salt solution at 2 ml/min. All measurements were made at 36 °C (temperature controller PTC-20, ALA Scientific Instrument Inc., Westbury, NY). Cells were illuminated with a 175-watt xenon arc lamp, and excitation wavelengths (340/380 nm) were selected by a Lambda DG-4 monochromator wavelength changer (Shutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured by digital video microfluorometry with an intensified charge-coupled device camera (CasCade, Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) coupled to a microscope and software (Metafluor, Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA) on a computer with a Pentium 4 microprocessor chip. Electrophysiology—Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed to measure currents with Axopatch-1C amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate capillaries (Chase Scientific Glass Inc., Rockwood, TN). The resistance of pipette was 2-5 megohms, and series resistance was compensated (>80%). Data were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. The pClamp8 (Axon Instruments) software was used during experiments and analysis. Pipette solution was (in mm): 135 CsCl, 5 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 Mg-ATP, 5 EGTA, 10 glucose, adjusted pH to 7.4 with CsOH, and 301 mosm. The bath was continuously perfused with extracellular solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH, and 305 mosm. Experiments were performed at a holding potential of -60 mV at 28 °C. Immunohistochemistry—Cells were identified after electrophysiological recording by marking the bottom of the cover glass surrounding the cells. To maintain the mark during staining, cover glasses were kept on parafilm during the immunohistochemical procedure (20Petruska J.C. Napaporn J. Johnson R.D. Gu J.G. Cooper B.Y. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 84: 2365-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 21Galoyan S.M. Petruska J.C. Mendell L.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were rat anti-TRPM8 (1:500, a gift from Dr. Makoto Tominaga) and guinea pig anti-TRPV1 (1:500, Chemicon), incubated at 4 °C overnight. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rat, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at 1:200, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the samples were covered with Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and visualized using a confocal microscope with the appropriate filter sets (LSM 5 PASCAL, Carl Zeiss, Germany). The primary antibodies were omitted as negative control (data not shown). Single Cell RT-PCR—We adopted methods described by Silbert et al. (22Silbert S.C. Beacham D.W. McCleskey E.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 34-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, following whole cell patch clamp recordings, we changed patch pipettes with a tip diameter of about 30 μm for cell collection. The intracellular content of a single cell was aspirated into a patch pipette under visual control and was gently put into a reaction tube containing reverse transcription agents. Optionally, to avoid genomic DNA contaminations, a DNase I (for 40 min at 37 °C) digest was performed before reverse transcription. After heat inactivation, RT was carried out for 50 min at 50 °C (superscript III, Invitrogen). Subsequently, the cDNA was divided into four or five 2-μl aliquots that were used in separate PCRs. All PCR amplifications were performed with nested primers (Table 1). The first round of PCR was preformed in 50 μl of PCR buffer containing 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.2 μm “outer” primers, 5 μl of RT product, and 0.2 μlof platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The protocol included 5 min of initial denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 40 s of denaturation at 95 °C, 40 s of annealing at 55 °C, and then 40 s of elongation at 72 °C, and was completed with 7 min of final elongation. For the second round of amplification, the reaction buffer (20 μl) contained 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.2 μm “inner” primers, 5 μl of the products from the first round, and 0.1 μl of platinum TaqDNA polymerase. The reaction was the same as the first round. The PCR products were then displayed on the ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gel. Gels were photographed using a digital camera.TABLE 1DNA primers used for single cell RT-PCRTarget gene (product length)Outer primersNested primersGenbank no.TRPV1 (426 bp, 245 bp)ATGCCAGCTACACAGACAGCTATGACCCTCTTGGTGGAGAATAF029310CCTTCCTGTTGGTGATCTCTTCTGTGTTATCTGCCACCTCCATRPM8 (369 bp, 244 bp)GAAGAGGAGATTGAGAGCTGGATCACGGTCATCAAGATGGAGAY072788GAGGACTTCATTGGTGAGGAACTTGGGCCTGTCCTTTATGAGTRPA1 (306 bp, 189 bp)ATCATGACCTGGCAGACTACCTAGCAACTGCTTCTGCATCCTAY496961GCCTACAAGCATAATGGAGAGGTTGTCCTCATCCATCACCAGNav1.8 (356 bp, 215 bp)AGATCCACTGTCTGGACATCCTCCAATCTCTCCAAAGCATCCU53833GAAAGACGTAGCAGAGGCAGTTGAGTCCACTGTTTGCCATGA Open table in a new tab Thermal Stimulation and Drug Application—For calcium imaging experiment, temperature was controlled by PTC-20, a Peltier temperature control system (ALA Scientific Instrument Inc.), in which coverslips were cooled down at a rate of 0.13 °C/s from 36 °C to 10 °C and heated at a rate of 0.1 °C/s from 36 °C to 46 °C. For thermal stimulation for whole cell patch clamp recordings, we applied cold (4 °C) or heated (70 °C) extracellular solution for 1 min. Final temperatures of thermal stimuli, cold and hot, measured by a thermistor placed in the recording chamber, were 12 °C and 45 °C, respectively. Capsaicin, capsazepine, and menthol stock solutions were made in ethanol and stored at -20 °C. Icilin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) to make stock solution and kept at -20 °C. All drugs were purchased from Sigma. We confirmed that 0.01% Me2SO or ethanol did not affect [Ca2+]i and currents measured in the present study. Drugs were diluted to their final concentration using the extracellular solution and then applied by gravity through a bath perfusion system with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Distribution of Dental Primary Afferent Neurons—We considered fluorescent DiI-labeled neurons present in the dissociations of TG to be dental primary afferents (17Eckert S.P. Taddese A. McCleskey E.W. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 77: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Chaudhary P. Martenson M.E. Baumann T.K. J. Dent. Res. 2001; 80: 1518-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). DiI-labeled neurons were ∼40 to 60 TG neurons per animal (n = 60), and they constituted ∼13% of total neurons (Fig. 1A, panels a and b). In differential interference contrast and fluorescent images of the same field (Fig. 1A, panels c and d, respectively), we found DiI-labeled TG neurons with IB4-positive (Fig. 1A, panels e and f). IB4-positive neurons were 57% (229/403) of dental primary afferent neurons and almost exclusively below 40-μm diameter (Fig. 1B), consistent with previous reports (16Cook S.P. Vulchanova L. Hargreaves K.M. Elde R. McCleskey E.W. Nature. 1997; 387: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 19Stucky C.L. Lewin G.R. J.

In the next experiments, we used IB4-positive dental primary afferent neurons (Fig. 1A, panel f). Interestingly, the proportion of IB4-positive neurons was relatively higher in dental primary afferents, compared with total TG neurons (Table 2).TABLE 2Numbers of trigeminal ganglion neurons and identified dental primary afferent neurons (Dil-labeled) responding to thermo-TRP ligands determined in single cell calcium imaging experiments The values are the percentages of cells in which calcium transients were observed; numbers in parentheses are numbers of cells tested.Small (<24 μm)Medium (24–38 μm)Large (38–60 μm)All neuronsDiI-labeledAll neuronsDiI-labeledAll neuronsDiI-labeledIB4-positive61% (280)85% (85)50% (280)58% (266)9% (280)4% (52)Capsaicin (C)57% (30)75% (20)47% (30)60% (20)30% (30)30% (10)Menthol (M)20% (50)30% (20)12% (50)20% (20)4% (50)10% (10)Icilin (I)14% (50)20% (20)8% (50)20% (20)0% (50)0% (10)C + M10% (50)15% (20)8% (50)15% (20)4% (50)10% (10)M + I6% (50)15% (20)6% (50)10% (20)0% (50)0% (10)C + I12% (50)20% (20)10% (50)15% (20)0% (50)0% (10)C + M + I8% (50)15% (20)6% (50)10% (20)0% (50)0% (10) Open table in a new tab Single Cell RT-PCR Analysis of Thermo-TRP Channel Expression by Dental Primary Afferent Neurons—We investigated using single cell RT-PCR whether dental primary afferent neurons would express TRPV1, TRPM8, and TRPA1, transmitting heat, cool, and cold sensation in sensory neurons (1Patapoutian A. Peier A.M. Story G.M. Viswanath V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 13Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). Among the dental primary afferent neurons (n = 55) randomly collected irrespective of soma size, it was found that 45% of identified dental primary afferent neurons expressed TRPV1, 13% expressed TRPM8, and 11% expressed TRPA1 (Fig. 1C). Some neurons expressed more than one TRP channel subunit (Fig. 1C). When we examined the expression of TTX-resistant sodium channel, NaV1.8, which is known to be restricted to nociceptors (25Lai J. Porreca F. Hunter J.C. Gold M.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 371-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), together with thermo-TRP channels, we found mRNA expression of NaV1.8 in 85% of these neurons, which were of small and medium sizes (Fig. 1C, panel b). These results suggested that dental primary afferent neurons with thermo-TRP channels might be associated with tooth pain. Ligands for Thermo-TRP Channels and Thermal Stimuli Increase Intracellular Calcium in Dental Primary Afferent Neurons—We examined the effects of capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist), menthol (a TRPM8 agonist), or icilin (a TRPM8 and TRPA1 agonist) on [Ca2+]i as a screen for the presence of functional thermo-TRP channels in tooth pulp afferents, using ratiometric calcium imaging. The application of vehicle at the beginning of the experiment (i.e. 0.01% ethanol or Me2SOin 1 ml of balanced salt solution) did not alter [Ca2+]i (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2, the subsequent application of thermo-TRP ligands clearly increased [Ca2+]i in subpopulations of neurons. To obtain the concentrations used in experiments, we confirmed the dose-response data (EC50, menthol, 85 ± 10.4 μm; icilin, 0.96 ± 0.2 μm, Fig. 2, A and B), which was similar to other previous reports (2Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7144) Google Scholar, 5McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 26Chuang H.H. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Neuron. 2004; 43: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Measurement of [Ca2+]i in tooth pulp afferents showed increases evoked by capsaicin (1 μm: 60% of neurons, ratio changes 1.0 ± 0.2), menthol (1 mm: 20%, ratio changes 1.0 ± 0.2), and icilin (10 μm: 16%, ratio changes 0.9 ± 0.2) (Fig. 2, C-E, and Table 2). Several neurons responded to more than one ligand (capsaicin and menthol, 14% of neurons; menthol and icilin, 10%; capsaicin and icilin, 14%; capsaicin, menthol and icilin, 8%) (Fig. 2F and Table 2), indicating considerable co-localization of thermo-TRP channels in subpopulations of dental primary afferent neurons. To confirm that neurons expressing thermo-TRP channel are responsive to natural thermal stimulation that might cause pain in teeth, we then examined the effects of heat or cold stimulation on [Ca2+]i. When heated above 42 ± 0.7 °C, capsaicin-sensitive neurons clearly showed increase of [Ca2+]i (0.3 ± 0.1, n = 10) (Fig. 3, A and D). Likewise, menthol- and icilin-sensitive neurons showed increase of [Ca2+]i (0.3 ± 0.1, n = 8, Fig. 3, B and D) below 25 ± 1.7 °C, and icilin-sensitive neurons responded below 17 ± 0.5 °C (0.2 ± 0.1, n = 7, Fig. 3, C and D). However, neurons that failed to respond to menthol and icilin also have no cold responses (n = 5). These results strongly suggest that thermo-TRP channels expressed by dental primary afferent neurons might act as specific detectors, which are activated at specific temperature point, for natural nociceptive thermal stimulation applied to teeth. Ligands for Thermo-TRP Channels and Thermal Stimuli Activate Inward Currents in Dental Primary Afferent Neurons—To further support our hypothesis, we next examined whether the activation of thermo-TRP channels would produce inward currents at the holding potential of -60 mV. Capsaicin, menthol, and icilin induced inward currents of 4.5 ± 1.8 nA (n = 30), 0.45 ± 0.15 nA (n = 12), and 0.32 ± 0.15 nA (n = 7), respectively (Fig. 4, A-C). The currents produced by these agonists reversed polarity at ∼0 mV and showed outward rectification, indicating that these currents were produced by the opening of TRP-channels. This result agreed with other previous reports (2Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7144) Google Scholar, 5McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 26Chuang H.H. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Neuron. 2004; 43: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results of calcium imaging, capsaicin-sensitive neurons also responded to heat (n = 9) and menthol-sensitive neurons were responsive to cold (n = 5, Fig. 4, D and E). To directly determine whether the responsiveness of dental primary afferent neurons to thermo-TRP ligands is associated with the expression of thermo-TRP channels, at the end of some electrophysiological recordings, the expression of TRP channels was determined by immunohistochemistry or single cell RT-PCR. In Fig. 5A, capsaicin- and menthol-sensitive dental primary afferent neuron (red) showed immunoreactivity of TRPV1 (green) and TRPM8 (blue). At single cell RT-PCR study, we confirmed the correlation between mRNA of each TRP channel and ligand-induced current. In Fig. 5B, capsaicin (panel a)-sensitive dental primary afferent expressed only TRPV1 mRNA, whereas icilin/capsaicin (panel b)- and menthol/capsaicin (panel c)-sensitive neurons expressed TRPA1/TRPV1 and TRPM8/TRPV1 mRNA, respectively. Taken together, this suggests that dental primary afferent neurons have TRP-channels as specific thermal detectors, which play an important role in the sensation of thermal stimuli.FIGURE 5Confocal laser microscopy and single cell RT-PCR of thermo-TRPs following whole cell recordings.

Thus, we suggest that activation of thermo-TRP channels expressed by these neurons may initiate sensory signals that contribute to tooth pain by temperature stimuli. It has been hypothesized that stimulation of tooth pulp by any type of stimulus results only in a painful sensation (15Taddese A. Nah S.Y. McCleskey E.W.

However, evidence of non-nociceptive neuron in tooth pulp has challenged this assumption so that the “pure pain” sensation of teeth became controversial (28Dong W.K. Chudler E.H. Martin R.F. Brain Res. 1985; 334: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, we first determined the proportion of “nociceptive” neurons among dental primary afferents. On the basis of neurochemical properties primary afferent neurons fall into two main classes. The first binds IB4 and expresses P2X3, c-RET, and NaV1.8 sodium channels. The second group is IB4-negative, contains calcitonin gene-related peptide and/or substance P, and expresses TrkA (29Hunt S.P. Mantyh P.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Our data obtained from IB4 staining revealed that a significant proportion of small primary afferent neurons were IB4-positive, whereas the large neurons were not (Fig. 1B). Single cell RT-PCR showed that most dental primary afferent neurons express NaV1.8 mRNA. These data strongly support the notion that the majority, but not all, of dental primary afferent neurons may be considered to be nociceptors. Stimuli that produce tooth pain include mechanical (toothbrush contact, instrument touch, and desiccation with air), chemical (citrus, sour, or sweet foods and beverages and acidic bacterial plaque by-products), and thermal (extremes of hot or cold food, liquids, or inhaled air). Thermal stimulation is often described as the most severe, and is widely used in dental clinic to test the vitality of the tooth pulp. Therefore, we focused in the present study on the molecular mechanisms that might underlie tooth pain caused by thermal stimulation. TRPV1 is a Ca2+-permeable channel activated by capsaicin and temperatures higher than 42 °C, and it is highly expressed in a subset of peptidergic and IB4-binding nociceptive neurons (1Patapoutian A. Peier A.M. Story G.M. Viswanath V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 2Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7144) Google Scholar). By single cell RT-PCR analysis, we found that TRPV1 is highly expressed in dental primary afferent neurons (Fig. 1C), consistent with a previous report (23Chaudhary P. Martenson M.E. Baumann T.K. J. Dent. Res. 2001; 80: 1518-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Morgan C.R. Rodd H.D. Clayton N. Davis J.B. Boissonade F.M. J. Orofac. Pain. 2005; 19: 248-260PubMed Google Scholar). Ratiometric calcium imaging showed that [Ca2+]i was increased by capsaicin as well as by heat stimulation (Figs. 2C and 3A), indicating clear functional responses attributable to TRPV1. Consistent with these data, heat-evoked currents were found in capsaicin-sensitive neurons (Fig. 4, A and D), which were similar to the responses evoked by heterologous expression of TRPV1 (18Yang B.H. Piao Z.G. Kim Y.B. Lee C.H. Lee J.K. Park K. Kim J.S. Oh S.B. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we observed expression of TRPV1 in the same neurons that gave capsaicin-evoked currents (Fig. 5). Thus, we propose that TRPV1 might be involved in nociceptive heat sensation in dental primary afferents. TRPM8 was originally identified as a cold and menthol receptor (CMR1) (3Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I. McIntyre P. Bevan S. Patapoutian A.

Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar); it is activated by menthol and cooling (8-25 °C). Because the temperature ranges that activate TRPM8 are similar to those that activate native innocuous cold-sensitive fibers, and because pain markers such as calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P, TRPV1, or IB4 do not co-localize with TRPM8, it has been suggested that TRPM8 has physiological function for innocuous thermosensation (5McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). However, our findings, that TRPM8 is expressed by a subset of pain and temperature-sensing neurons such as TrkA-positive small diameter neurons and activated by the noxious cold range of temperatures (3Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I. McIntyre P. Bevan S. Patapoutian A.

Pain. 2005; 1: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), led us to re-examine the possibility of involvement of TRPM8 in cold sensation. A subset of neurons that expressed TRPM8 were found (Fig. 1C), and menthol and cold stimulation not only increased [Ca2+]i (Figs. 2D and 3B) but also evoked inward currents (Fig. 4B). The percentage of menthol-sensitive neurons in the trigeminal ganglion was similar to that previously reported (5McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 33Abe J. Hosokawa H. Okazawa M. Kandachi M. Sawada Y. Yamanaka K. Matsumura K. Kobayashi S. Brain Res. Mol.

Although it was originally suggested that TRPM8 does not co-exist with TRPV1 (3Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I. McIntyre P. Bevan S. Patapoutian A. Cell. 2002; 108: 705-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar), other reports indicated colocalization of TRPM8 and TRPV1 (33Abe J. Hosokawa H.

Lett. 2004; 359: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In agreement with these latter reports, we also found TRPM8 to be co-localized with TRPV1 in some primary afferent neurons (Figs. 1C and 5B). Moreover, some neurons were responsive to both menthol and capsaicin (Fig. 5, A and C), and sometimes to icilin as well (Fig. 2F). Taken together, our data suggested the potential role of TRPM8 channels in thermosensation of dental afferents. TRPA1 is a more distantly related TRP channel, homologous to Drosophila Painless (37Goodman M.B. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 643-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 38Tracey Jr., W.D. Wilson R.I. Laurent G. Benzer S. Cell. 2003; 113: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) and activated by noxious cold temperature (<∼17 °C): this temperature is reported as being painfully cold by humans. TRPA1 is also activated by icilin, but not by menthol. Unlike TRPM8, TRPA1 is expressed in a subset of sensory neurons that express the nociceptive markers such as calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P (4Story G.M. Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Eid S.R. Mosbacher J. Hricik T.R. Earley T.J. Hergarden A.C. Andersson D.A. Hwang S.W. McIntyre P. Jegla T. Bevan S. Patapoutian A. Cell. 2003; 112: 819-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). We also found the expression of TRPA1 in a subset of dental primary afferents (Fig. 1C), suggesting a potential action as a transducer of cold sensation in teeth. The percentage of TRPA1-expressing cells was similar to that of total trigeminal ganglion previously reported (4Story G.M. Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Eid S.R. Mosbacher J. Hricik T.R. Earley T.J.

It is interesting to find that some neurons responded to icilin alone (Figs. 2E and 3C), whereas other neurons responded to both icilin and menthol (Figs. 2D, 2F, and 3B). Based on the specificity of the ligands, it is likely that individual neurons can express either TRPA1 or TRPM8, respectively. TRPA1 is also known to be expressed in a subset of sensory neurons that express the noxious-heat receptor, TRPV1 (4Story G.M. Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Eid S.R. Mosbacher J. Hricik T.R. Earley T.J.

We also found that TRPA1 and TRPV1 were expressed together in a subset of dental primary afferent neurons (Figs. 1C and 5C); these might act as polymodal nociceptive neurons that respond to both noxious heat and cold. The co-expression of subtypes of thermo-TRP channels in dental primary afferent neurons provide a likely explanation why pain is the sensation mostly perceived in teeth, irrespective of the sub-modality of thermal stimuli. Given that the sensation perceived from teeth by cold and hot stimuli is not always identical, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying thermal and pain sensations of teeth is likely to be more complex, rather than simply induced by the activation of molecules such as thermo-TRPs in dental primary afferents, which are highly specialized to detect specific ranges of temperature (1Patapoutian A. Peier A.M. Story G.M. Viswanath V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Odontoblasts, which have a process extending into the dentin, can also contribute to nociceptive and non-nociceptive sensory processing in teeth (39Magloire H. Lesage F. Couble M.L. Lazdunski M. Bleicher F. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Non-TRP channels such as TREK-1 (a member of a family of mammalian two-pore domain K+channel) might also be involved in thermosensation (1Patapoutian A. Peier A.M. Story G.M. Viswanath V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and have been demonstrated to be expressed by odontoblasts (39Magloire H. Lesage F. Couble M.L. Lazdunski M. Bleicher F. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Odontoblasts also express subfamilies of thermo-TRP channels. 3C.-K. Park, M. S. Kim, Z. Fang, H. Y. Li, S. J. Jung, S.-Y. Choi, S. J. Lee, K. Park, J. S. Kim, and S. B. Oh, unpublished data. From the observation that various stimuli, including cold, heat, acids, pressure, chemicals, and high osmotic solutions, create the movement of fluid within the dentin tubules, Brännström proposed that any kinds of stimulus that cause the fluid within the tubules to flow inward or outward create a mechanical disturbance or cellular perturbation, thereby exciting the nerves in the tooth (10Brannstrom M. Linden L.A. Astrom A. Caries Res. 1967; 1: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 11Brannstrom M. Astrom A. Int. Dent. J. 1972; 22: 219-227PubMed Google Scholar). If this is the case, dental primary afferents are also likely to express low threshold mechanoreceptors with high sensitivity. Our ongoing work on these two possibilities will also help us further understand the detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying tooth pain. In conclusion, our results support a potential role of thermo-TRP channels in the transduction of tooth pain. Thermo-TRP channels are expressed by dental primary afferent neurons, and the neurons are activated by the appropriate thermal stimuli. Given that rational treatment of pain requires identification of pain mechanisms as a target of drug therapy, thermo-TRP channels might constitute a new distinctive target for the development of therapeutic intervention for tooth pain.

Speck R.F. Ma M.C. Goldsmith M.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4933-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Here we identify fragments of the Lake Victoria marburgvirus (Musoke strain; MARV-Mus) and Zaire ebolavirus (Mayinga stain; ZEBOV-May) GP1 subunit that efficiently bound cells permissive to filovirus infection but not a nonpermissive lymphocyte cell line. Each fragment inhibited infection of retroviruses pseudotyped with either marburgvirus or ebolavirus GP1,2. Both fragments also inhibited replication of infectious Zaire ebolavirus. Our data define homologous regions of otherwise divergent filoviruses that mediate association with a common receptor. Similarities in these receptor-binding domains may provide insight into the nature of this receptor and suggest vaccine and therapeutic approaches effective against all filoviruses. Cells and Culture Conditions—African green monkey kidney (Vero E6) cells and Jurkat lymphocytes were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC numbers CRL-1586 and TIB-152, respectively). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells are a derivative of 293 cells (ATCC CRL1573) created by S. Haase and described originally as 293/tsA1609neo (34DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Adherent cells (Vero E6 and 293T) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and Jurkat lymphocytes in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Cellgro), and cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Construction of Filovirus Envelope Glycoprotein-encoding Genes and Variants—Codon-optimized Lake Victoria marburgvirus strain Musoke (MARV-Mus) open reading frames (ORFs) encoding GP1 (amino acid residues 17-432) and GP1,2 (amino acid residues 17-681) lacking signal sequences were synthesized and amplified by de novo recursive PCR, using overlapping DNA oligomers based on the MARV-Mus GP1,2 protein sequence (GenBank™ accession number CAA781117). A codon-optimized Zaire ebolavirus strain Mayinga (ZEBOV-May) ORF encoding a mucin-like domain-deleted GP1 truncation variant (amino acid residues 33–308) (13Jeffers S.A. Sanders D.A. Sanchez A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12463-12472Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) was synthesized based on the ZEBOV-May GP1,2 protein sequence (GenBank™ accession number NP_066246), using the same strategy. ORFs were ligated into a previously described pCDM8-derived expression vector (35Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), encoding the CD5 signal sequence upstream of the ORF insert, and the Fc region of human immunoglobulin G1 downstream (MARV-Mus GP1-(17–432)-Fc and ZEBOV-May GP1-(33–308)-Fc). Vectors encoding N- and C-terminal truncation variants were generated by inverse PCR amplification using plasmids encoding MARV-Mus GP1-(17–432)-Fc or ZEBOV-May GP1-(33–308)-Fc as templates. An ORF encoding MARV-Mus GP1,2 residues 17–681 was cloned into a variant of the pCDM8 expression vector encoding the CD5 signal sequence and a C-terminal C9 tag (amino acid sequence GTETSQVAPA) derived from the rhodopsin C terminus (MARV-Mus GP1,2). Plasmid encoding a ZEBOV-May GP1,2 variant lacking its mucin-like domain, ZEBOV-May GP1,2-(Δ309–489) (4Wool-Lewis R.J. Bates P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3155-3160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was generously provided by Dr. James Cunningham. Plasmids encoding MARV-Ang GP1-Fc variants were generated by altering their equivalent MARV-Mus GP1-Fc variants at codon 74 (T74A), using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). Expression of Filovirus Envelope Glycoprotein Variants—For protein purification, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding MARV-Mus GP1-(17–432)-Fc or ZEBOV-May GP1-(33–308)-Fc, their truncation variants, or control proteins (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus strain Tor2 S(318–510)-Fc (SARS-CoV RBD-Fc) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain ADA gp120-Fc (36Choe H.

Cells were washed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) 6 h post-transfection and grown at 37 °C in 293 SFM II medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μm minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids solution (Invitrogen), 2 mm sodium butyrate (Sigma), and 4 mm l-glutamine (Sigma). Medium was harvested after 48 h, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation and filtration through a 0.22-μm pore size filter (Corning Glass). Proteins were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose fast flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 16 h in the presence of Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Beads were washed once with 30-bed volumes of 0.5 m sodium chloride/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (NaCl, Fisher; PBS, Invitrogen), and once with 10-bed volumes of PBS. Proteins were eluted with 50 mm sodium citrate, 50 mm glycine, pH 2 (sodium citrate, Fisher; glycine, Bio-Rad), neutralized with sodium hydroxide (Fisher), dialyzed in PBS, and concentrated with Centricon centrifugal filter units (Millipore). Purified proteins were assayed for size and concentration by comparison to bovine serum albumin standards (Sigma) by SDS-PAGE followed by Bio-Safe Coomassie (Bio-Rad) staining, and by using the Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Binding Assays—293T cells and Vero E6 cells were detached with PBS, 5 mm EDTA (Invitrogen) 48 h after plating, resuspended in an equal volume of PBS, 5 mm MgCl2 (Sigma), and washed twice in PBS, 2% goat serum (Sigma). Jurkat lymphocytes were harvested and washed twice in PBS, 2% goat serum. GP1-Fc constructs, truncation variants thereof, and control proteins were added to 5 × 105 cells to a final concentration of 100 nm and incubated on ice for 1.5 h. Cells were washed twice in PBS, 2% goat serum and incubated for 45 min on ice with a 1:40 dilution of goat Fc-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (Sigma) in PBS, 2% goat serum. Cells were washed three times with PBS, 2% goat serum, once in PBS, and fixed with PBS, 2% formaldehyde (Sigma). Cell-surface binding of constructs was detected by flow cytometry with 10,000 events counted per sample. Base-line fluorescence was determined by measuring cells treated only with goat Fc-specific FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody, which was then subtracted from binding values of the tested constructs and control proteins. Infection Assay with Filovirus Envelope Glycoprotein-pseudotyped Retroviruses—To generate retroviral pseudotypes, 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with plasmid encoding MARV-Mus GP1,2, ZEBOV-May GP1,2-(Δ309–489), or vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSV) G protein, together with the pQCXIX vector (BD Biosciences) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), and plasmid encoding the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag and pol genes (38Moore M.J.

Cell supernatants were harvested 48 h post-transfection, cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation, filtered through a 0.45-μm pore size filter (Corning Glass), and stored at 4 °C. Supernatants containing pseudotyped viruses were added to 293T or Vero E6 cells in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of filovirus Fc truncation variants or control proteins. After 5 h, cells were washed once in PBS and replenished with fresh media. After 48 h, cells were imaged by fluorescent microscopy and detached with trypsin for analysis by flow cytometry. Infection Assay with Recombinant Green Fluorescent Protein-expressing Zaire Ebolavirus—All experiments with infectious filovirus were performed under biosafety level 4 conditions. Vero E6 cells were infected with a GFP-expressing ZEBOV-May created by reverse genetics (39Towner J.S. Paragas J. Dover J.E. Gupta M. Goldsmith C.S. Huggins J.W. Nichol S.T. Virology. 2005; 332: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Virus was incubated with cells at a multiplicity of infection equal to 1 for 1 h in the presence or absence of 800 nm of filovirus truncation variants or control protein. Virus was removed, cells were washed in PBS, and media and protein were replenished. After 48 h, cells were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. After 3 days of fixation, cells were removed from the biosafety level 4 suite, and the percentage of GFP-expressing cells was measured with a Discovery-1 automated microscope (Molecular Devices Corp.) by measuring nine individual spots per well. MARV-Mus GP1 Truncation Variant 38–188-Fc Efficiently Binds to Filovirus-permissive Cells—The envelope glycoproteins of a number of viruses include discrete, independently folded domains that bind cellular receptors as efficiently as their entire ectodomain regions. We sought to identify similar RBDs of MARV-Mus and ZEBOV-May. To determine the location of the MARV-Mus GP1 RBD, we synthesized a codon-optimized gene encoding the full-length mature MARV-Mus GP1 protein fused to the Fc region of human immunoglobulin G1 at the C terminus (17–432-Fc). Four sets of seven truncation variants were created, starting at N-terminal residues 17, 38, 61, or 87 and ending at C-terminal residues 432, 308, 265, 230, 188, 167, or 134 (Fig. 1A). All 28 constructs expressed efficiently in 293T cells as Fc fusion proteins (Fig. 1B). Equivalent concentrations of each variant were incubated with MARV-Mus-permissive African green monkey kidney Vero E6 and human embryonic kidney 293T cells and with nonpermissive Jurkat lymphocytes (5Chan S.Y. Speck R.F. Ma M.C. Goldsmith M.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4933-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and cell-surface association was determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 2, A–C). The RBDs of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S protein (residues 318–510) and HIV-1 gp120, expressed as Fc fusion proteins (SARS-CoV RBD-Fc, gp120-Fc), were used as controls (36Choe H. Li W. Wright P.L. Vasilieva N. Venturi M. Huang C.C. Grundner C. Dorfman T. Zwick M.B. Wang L. Rosenberg E.S. Kwong P.D. Burton D.R. Robinson J.E. Sodroski J.G. Farzan M.

As reported previously, SARS-CoV RBD-Fc efficiently bound SARS-CoV-permissive Vero E6 cells but not 293T cells or Jurkat lymphocytes (40Li W. Moore M.J. Vasilieva N. Sui J. Wong S.K. Berne M.A. Somasundaran M. Sullivan J.L. Luzuriaga K. Greenough T.C. Choe H. Farzan M. Nature. 2003; 426: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar). Also as expected, gp120-Fc bound CD4-expressing Jurkat lymphocytes but not Vero E6 or 293T cells. All 28 MARV-Mus proteins bound to Vero E6 and 293T cells with varying efficiencies, whereas little or no association was observed with Jurkat lymphocytes in most cases. Successive truncation of the C termini of MARV-Mus GP1 variants initiated with residues 17, 38, 61, or 87 led to successively increased cell-surface binding to Vero E6 cells, up through the C-terminal truncation at residue 188 (Fig. 2A). Further truncation beyond residue 188 decreased cell association. A single exception to this trend was observed with the 87–432-Fc variant, which bound Vero E6 cells with higher affinity than 87–308-Fc and 87–265-Fc. Variants initiated with residues 38, 61, and 87 bound more efficiently than those initiated with residue 17, with MARV-Mus-(38–188)-Fc consistently binding most efficiently to Vero E6 and 293T cells (Fig. 2B). These data identify a cell-binding region of MARV-Mus, located between GP1 residues 38 and 188.FIGURE 2Binding of MARV-Mus and ZEBOV-May GP1-Fc truncation variants to the surface of nonhuman primate and human cells. The indicated MARV-Mus (A–C) and ZEBOV-May GP1-Fc constructs (D–F) and control proteins were incubated with filovirus-permissive African green monkey kidney (Vero E6) cells (A and D), filovirus-permissive 293T cells (B and E), and filovirus-nonpermissive Jurkat lymphocytes (C and F) and analyzed by flow cytometry using an Fc-specific FITC-conjugated secondary antibody.

Sanders D.A. Sanchez A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12463-12472Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 16Yang Z.-Y. Duckers H.J. Sullivan N.J. Sanchez A. Nabel E.G. Nabel G.J. Nat.

To determine the location of the ZEBOV-May GP1 RBD, we synthesized a codon-optimized gene encoding the mature ZEBOV GP1 protein, lacking its mucin-like domain, and fused to the IgG1 Fc region (33–308-Fc). Three sets of four truncation variants were created, starting at N-terminal residues 33, 54, or 76 and ending at C-terminal residues 308, 201, 172, or 156 (Fig. 1C). With the exception of variant 76–172-Fc, all variants expressed efficiently (Fig. 1D). As with the MARV-Mus variants, equivalent concentrations of each variant were incubated with ZEBOV-May-permissive Vero E6 and 293T cells and with nonpermissive Jurkat lymphocytes, and cell association was again assayed by flow cytometry. All 11 ZEBOV-May GP1 variants bound to Vero E6 and 293T cells, whereas binding to Jurkat lymphocytes was negligible in all cases (Fig. 2, D–F). ZEBOV-May GP1 truncation variants showed a pattern of association to Vero E6 and 293T cells similar to that observed with MARV-Mus variants. In particular, 54–201-Fc and 76–201-Fc bound more efficiently than all other ZEBOV-May GP1 variants assayed, with 54–201-Fc binding slightly but consistently better than 76–201-Fc to Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2, D–E). These data identify a cell-binding region of ZEBOV-May, located between GP1 residues 54 and 201, which corresponds to the cell-binding region of MARV-Mus. MARV Strains Angola and Musoke GP1 Truncation Variants Bind to Filovirus-permissive Cells with Comparable Efficiency—The largest and most severe marburgvirus disease outbreak to date occurred in Angola in early 2005 (41Hovette P. Méd. Trop. (Mars.). 2005; 65: 127-128PubMed Google Scholar, 42World Health OrganizationWkly. Epidemiol. Rec. 2005; 80: 298Google Scholar). The envelope glycoprotein amino acid sequence of the strain responsible for this outbreak, MARV Angola (MARV-Ang), is homologous to that of the MARV-Mus strain (43Towner J.S. Khristova M.L. Sealy T.K. Vincent M.J. Erickson B.R. Bawiec D.A. Hartman A.L. Comer J.A. Zaki S.R. Ströher U. Gomes da Silva F. del Castillo F. Rollin P. Ksiazek T.G. Nichol S.T. J. Virol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). In particular, a comparison between MARV-Mus GP1 amino acid residues 38–188 with the corresponding region of MARV-Ang yielded only one amino acid change, threonine 74 to alanine (T74A). This alteration was introduced into four MARV-Mus GP1 truncation variants (MARV-Ang GP1-(38–188)-Fc, -(38–167)-Fc, -(61–188)-Fc, and -(61–167)-Fc; see Fig. 3A). Cell association of each of these variants was compared with those of MARV-Mus. Each MARV-Ang variant bound Vero E6 cells slightly less efficiently than its MARV-Mus counterpart (Fig. 3B). These data largely exclude the possibility that more efficient cellular association of the MARV-Ang cell-binding region contributes to increased severity of disease. Both MARV-Mus and ZEBOV-May GP1 Cell-binding Regions Inhibit Entry of Retroviruses Pseudotyped with the GP1,2 of Either Filovirus—To determine whether the identified GP1 cell-binding regions associated with factors necessary for infection, we assayed the ability of MARV-Mus-(38–188)-Fc and ZEBOV-May-(54–201)-Fc to inhibit entry of pseudotyped retroviruses. A Moloney murine leukemia virus vector expressing GFP was pseudotyped with the GP1,2 of MARV-Mus (MARV/MLV), a mucin-like domain-deleted GP1,2 of ZEBOV-May (ZEBOV/MLV), or with the G protein of vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSV/MLV). Vero E6 cells were incubated with these pseudotyped retroviruses and varying concentrations of MARV-Mus-(38–188)-Fc, ZEBOV-May-(54–201)-Fc, or SARS-CoV RBD-Fc (Fig. 4, A–C). No Fc fusion protein inhibited VSV/MLV, but both MARV-Mus-(38–188)-Fc and ZEBOV-May-(54–201)-Fc efficiently inhibited both MARV/MLV and ZEBOV/MLV. SARS-CoV RBD-Fc did not inhibit infection of either pseudotyped virus. MARV-Mus-(38–188) was the more potent of the two cellular bindin"

The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of HO-1 overexpression on mitochondrial transporters, cytochrome c oxidase, and anti-apoptotic proteins in diabetic rats (streptozotocin, (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes). Renal mitochondrial carnitine, deoxynucleotide, and ADP/ATP carriers were significantly reduced in diabetic compared with nondiabetic rats (p < 0.05). The citrate carrier was not significantly decreased in diabetic tissue. CoPP administration produced a robust increase in carnitine, citrate, deoxynucleotide, dicarboxylate, and ADP/ATP carriers and no significant change in oxoglutarate and aspartate/glutamate carriers. The increase in mitochondrial carriers (MCs) was associated with a significant increase in cytochrome c oxidase activity. The administration of tin mesoporphyrin (SnMP), an inhibitor of HO-1 activity, prevented the restoration of MCs in diabetic rats. Human HO-1 cDNA transfer into diabetic rats increased both HO-1 protein and activity, and restored mitochondrial ADP/ATP and deoxynucleotide carriers. The increase in HO-1 by CoPP administration was associated with a significant increase in the phosphorylation of AKT and levels of BcL-XL proteins. These observations in experimental diabetes suggest that the cytoprotective mechanism of HO-1 against oxidative stress involves an increase in the levels of MCs and anti-apoptotic proteins as well as in cytochrome c oxidase activity.

Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2129-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial ROS production associated with hyperglycemia is increased because of the lack of antioxidants, thus restoration of antioxidant levels is beneficial in decreasing mitochondrial membrane dysfunction (22Green K.

Abnormalities in mitochondrial transport, either through a decrease or an increase in one of the carriers, have been shown to cause an increase in superoxide anion (O–2) production (24Palmieri F.

Furthermore, inhibition of mitochondrial transport has been shown to decrease protein kinase C activity in cell cultures exposed to high glucose (13Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S.

Biophys. 1990; 280: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have shown a decrease in the mitochondrial citrate carrier but an increase in both pyruvate and dicarboxylate transporters in streptozotocin-treated rats. In addition, a diabetes-induced decrease in the activity of the ADP/ATP transporter has been attributed to increased levels of long chain acyl-CoA, which is present in diabetic mitochondria. Decreased mitochondrial transport carriers will decrease pH gradient and impair the generation of ATP. Increased levels of the antioxidant proteins, catalase and metallothionine have been shown to restore mitochondrial function in diabetes (13Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T.

Carlson E.C. Epstein P.N. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1336-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The renal and vascular cytoprotective effect of HO-1, leading to increased cell survival in vitro and in vivo, has been previously described (6Abraham N.G. Kushida T. McClung J. Weiss M. Quan S. Lafaro R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Wolin M. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Abraham N.G. Rezzani R. Rodella L. Kruger A. Taller D. Li V.G. Goodman A.I. Kappas A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2004; 287: H2468-H2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); however, little is known about the mechanism involved. Mitochondrial transport of important substrates may play a significant role in the mechanism of cytoprotection. Oxidative stress results in the activation of multiple signaling cascades that ultimately dictate the outcome for cell survival. Certain signals tend to favor the anti-apoptotic pathway, whereas others promote the apoptotic pathway. ERK and AKT are known for their activation in response to increased HO-1 or CO generation and may play an important role in preventing apoptosis (28Zhang X. Shan P. Alam J. Fu X.Y. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8714-8721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The effect of HO-1 gene expression and activity on the activation of AKT and BcL-XL proteins, which may be involved in the enhancement of mitochondrial carrier proteins in diabetes, remains to be determined. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that either increase or decrease HO-1 on certain MCs and the anti-apoptotic proteins AKT and BcL-XL and pro-apoptotic proteins Bax. Our results demonstrate the restoration of six MCs, i.e. carnitine, citrate, phosphate, deoxynucleotide, ATP, and dicarboxylate, as a result of an increase in HO-1 protein and activity caused by CoPP administration to diabetic rats. In addition, specific human HO-1 gene transfer to diabetic rats resulted in the restoration of MCs including ADP/ATP and dicarboxylate. Taken together, these results suggest that HO-mediated cytoprotection in diabetic rats involves restoration of MCs, a robust increase in the phosphorylation of AKT and an increase in BcL-XL signaling proteins. Development of Diabetes—Diabetes was induced in Sprague-Dawley (S.D.) rats by a single injection, via the tail vein, of streptozotocin (STZ, 65 mg/kg, pH 4.5). Age-matched control rats were injected with an equal volume of vehicle (0.1 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.8). Rats were divided into four groups: control, STZ, STZ plus CoPP, and STZ plus CoPP and SnMP (9Turkseven S. Kruger A. Mingone C.J. Kaminski P. Inaba M. Rodella L. Ikehara S. Wolin M.S. Abraham N.G. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 289: H701-H707Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). CoPP (0.5 mg/100 g/bw) were given subcutaneously once a week starting from the day after diabetes developed. SnMP (2 mg/100 g/bw) was given twice a week. Serum glucose levels increased from 128.3 ± 7.2 mg/dl to 491.7 ± 25.6 mg/dl after STZ treatment. Insulin administration (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH)) (3 times/week) decreased serum glucose to 298.6 ± 11.3, 295.3 ± 8.9, and 294 ± 2.5 mg/dl in animals receiving STZ alone, STZ+CoPP, and STZ+CoPP+SnMP, respectively. Insulin dose was individualized and thus dosages were different between the groups. Under these conditions body weight did not significantly change. The body weight of non-diabetic rats was 412 ± 10.7 g compared with 393 ± 20.7 g in diabetic rats. Similarly, body weights of diabetic rats treated with CoPP or CoPP+SnMP were 436.7 ± 16.1 and 400 ± 2.9 g, respectively, which was not significantly different from the control group. Blood for glucose determinations (Lifescan Inc., Milpitas, CA) was obtained from the tail vein; specimens were obtained after an overnight fast. HO-1 transgenic rats were generated by retroviral gene transfer of human HO-1 in sense orientation to newborns, as has been previously described (27Abraham N.G. Rezzani R. Rodella L. Kruger A. Taller D. Li V.G. Goodman A.I. Kappas A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2004; 287: H2468-H2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Each experiment required nine pregnant S.D. rats to deliver about 80 littermates. Male rats (about 50%) were separated and used for viral delivery. The concentrated retroviruses (3–5 × 109 cfu/ml) were prepared as previously described (29Sabaawy H.E. Zhang F. Nguyen X. Elhosseiny A. Nasjletti A. Schwartzman M. Dennery P. Kappas A. Abraham N.G.

Hypertens. 2000; 18: 353-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and injected into the newborns twice intraventricularly at day 5 (20 μl) and day 12 (40 μl). Following injection, the rats were allowed to recover and were returned to their cages with the appropriate mothers for continued weaning. Transgenic rats overexpressing HO-1 or empty retroviral vector (LXSN) were kept in a pathogen-free environment. The animals were weaned at 21 days and housed in their own cages. Experiments were conducted in 12–13-week-old male rats (350–375 g body weight). At different time points, rats were taken to measure the expression of human HO-1 protein in various tissues. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated the functional expression of the gene of interest in all tissues, including kidney, aorta, heart, femoral artery, lung, and liver for up to six months (29Sabaawy H.E.

Hypertension. 2004; 43: 1221-1226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Hyperglycemia was induced in the transgenic rats as described above. Animals were sacrificed using pentobarbital, and tissues were immediately excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted under the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mitochondrial and Microsomal Fraction—Mitochondria fractions were isolated from renal tissues as follows. Renal sections were diced and incubated in cold buffer containing sucrose (250 mm), Tris, pH 7.8 (100 mm), EGTA (1.0 mm), and PMSF (1.0 mm), and protease-phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. Diced tissues were homogenized in 8–10 vol of the same buffer by six strokes of a motor-driven Teflon pestle in a glass rotor homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged 10 min at 1000 × g to remove unbroken cell and large debris. The supernatant (kidney homogenate) was then centrifuged 10 min at 8000 × g to pellet the mitochondria. The supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g to pellet the microsomal fraction. The mitochondrial fraction was washed twice by gentle homogenization and centrifuged for 15 min at 8000 × g and the final pellet was resuspended in ice-cold Sotarage buffer (Tris-sucrose buffer, pH 7.8) as previously described by our laboratory (33Camadro J.M. Ibraham N.G. Levere R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5678-5682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Abraham N.G. Camadro J.M. Hoffstein S.T. Levere R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Expression of MCs and cytochrome oxidase activity were measured. Under these conditions, cytochrome c oxidase, a mitochondrial marker, was expressed at about 8–10% in the microsomal fraction. The samples were assayed for protein concentration using a Bio-Rad kit based on the Bradford dye binding procedure. Microsomal fractions were homogenized in 10 mm phosphate buffer, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% tergitol, pH 7.5. The homogenate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for assessing HO-1/HO-2, AKT, BcL-XL, Bad protein levels, and HO activity. HO activity was measured as previously described (6Abraham N.G. Kushida T. McClung J. Weiss M. Quan S. Lafaro R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Wolin M. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Protein levels were visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies against rat HO-1, HO-2 (Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, BC) and with antibodies against human AAC, AGC, CAC, DNC, against bovine OGC and PiC, and against rat CiC and DiC, which were generated in our laboratory. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (Invitrogen) and AKT, P38, BcL-2, BcL-XL, and antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Briefly, 20 μg of lysate supernatant was separated by 12% SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was performed as has been previously described (6Abraham N.G. Kushida T. McClung J. Weiss M. Quan S. Lafaro R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Wolin M. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Chemiluminescence detection was performed with the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of Cytochrome c Oxidase Activity—Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity was determined with a commercial enzyme assay kit (Sigma/Aldrich Inc.), according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, the enzyme assay for cytochrome c oxidase is based on observation of the decrease in absorbance at 550 nm of ferrocytochrome c caused by its oxidation to ferricytochrome c by cytochrome c oxidase. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. (S.E.). Statistical significance (p < 0.05) between the experimental groups was determined by the Fisher method of analysis for multiple comparisons. For comparison between treatment groups, the null hypothesis was tested by a single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple groups or unpaired Student's t test for two groups. Effect of HO-1 Inducers and Inhibitors of HO Activity on Mitochondrial Transport Carriers—To investigate the expression of HO in renal tissue of diabetic rats, we measured HO-1/HO-2 protein levels. As seen in Fig. 1A, HO-1 protein was not significantly changed in renal tissue of diabetic rats relative to controls. As seen in Fig. 1A (lower panel) densitometry analysis showed no significant changes in HO-1 protein levels in diabetic rats (n = 7). Using the pharmacological agent CoPP, an inducer of HO-1, allowed us to examine the effects of HO-1-associated activity on mitochondrial transporters. As seen in Fig. 1B, weekly administration of CoPP for 6 weeks resulted in a robust increase in the amount of renal HO-1 protein compared with control (p < 0.001). HO-2 protein did not change with diabetes or following administration of HO-1 inducer. Although, the administration of SnMP, which has been shown to inhibit HO activity in animals and humans, resulted in activation of HO-1 protein expression, as has been observed previously (9Turkseven S. Kruger A. Mingone C.J. Kaminski P. Inaba M. Rodella L. Ikehara S. Wolin M.S. Abraham N.G. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 289: H701-H707Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), SnMP did not cause a significant change in HO-1 proteins in CoPP-treated rats. SnMP inhibited HO activity to 0.22 ± 0.004 nmol of bilirubin/60 min/mg protein when compared with control, i.e. 0.59 ± 0.05 nmol of bilirubin/60 min/mg protein (Fig. 1C). The repeated administration of CoPP resulted in a continuous sustained increase in HO activity (Fig. 1C) (p < 0.001), compared with diabetic rats treated with vehicle. HO activity in CoPP-treated diabetic rats was 2.25 ± 0.48 nmol of bilirubin/60 min/mg protein compared with 0.22 ± 0.04 nmol of bilirubin/60 min/mg protein in diabetic rats (p < 0.001). Because HO-1 overexpression has been shown to increase antioxidant levels (6Abraham N.G. Kushida T. McClung J. Weiss M. Quan S. Lafaro R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Wolin M. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), presumably by suppressing O–2) (reviewed in Abraham and Kappas (4Abraham N.G. Kappas A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar)), we examined if HO-1 can increase the levels of MCs. As shown in Fig. 2, the carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier protein and citrate carriers were decreased in the diabetic kidney compared with controls. As seen from the densitometry analysis, the protein levels of carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier was decreased in diabetic rats (p < 0.05). Weekly administration of CoPP for 6 weeks increased the levels of carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier protein (p < 0.001 versus STZ-vehicle). A similar result was observed on the citrate carrier proteins (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Densitometry analysis showed that the citrate carrier was significantly increased in diabetic rats treated with CoPP (p < 0.005 versus STZ-vehicle). The HO-1-mediated increase in both carriers was dependent on HO-1 activity because bi-weekly administration of SnMP for 6 weeks inhibited HO activity and prevented a CoPP-mediated increase in these carriers (Fig. 2, upper and lower panel). The suppressive effect of diabetes on MCs involves three other carrier proteins, deoxynucleotide, dicarboxylate, and phosphate, which were decreased compared with control (Fig. 2B). As seen in Fig. 2B (lower panel), the ratio of deoxynucleotide, dicarboxylate and phosphate carrier protein to CYT IV was significantly decreased (p < 0.03, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). Administration of CoPP to diabetic rats increased deoxynucleotide, dicarboxylate and phosphate carriers compared with diabetics receiving vehicle solution (p < 0.04, p < 0.01, and p < 0.01, respectively). Neither diabetes nor treatment with CoPP had an effect on oxoglutarate and aspartate/glutamate carrier proteins (Fig. 2, A and B). Simultaneous administration of SnMP to CoPP-treated diabetic rats decreased phosphate, deoxynucleotide, and dicarboxylate carriers, suggesting that increased expression of HO-1 and HO activity contributed to the activation of MCs. In addition, the ADP/ATP carriers were also decreased in diabetic rats, but were increased by CoPP administration (Fig. 2C). As seen in the lower panel of Fig. 2C, the ADP/ATP carrier ratio to oxoglutarate was significantly decreased in the diabetic kidney (0.99 ± 0.08 to 0.49 ± 0.93) when compared with control (p < 0.05). Effect of Diabetes and HO-1 on Cytochrome c Oxidase Activity—Because MCs are considered important in regulating electron transport and cytochrome c oxidase activity (24Palmieri F. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 689-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), we measured the effect of up-regulation of HO-1 on cytochrome c oxidase activity. As seen in Fig. 3, cytochrome c oxidase activity was significantly decreased (45%) in kidneys from diabetic animals compared with kidneys from control rats (p < 0.05). In contrast, kidneys from diabetic rats treated with CoPP displayed a significant increase in renal cytochrome c oxidase activity compared with control and diabetic rats receiving vehicle (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Cytochrome c oxidase activity in diabetic rats was 0.45 ± 0.01 units/mg compared with 1.33 ± 0.02 units/mg protein in diabetic rats preconditioned with the HO-1 gene. As observed for the MCs, the HO-1-mediated increase in cytochrome c oxidase activity was abrogated by SnMP. Effect of Human HO-1 Gene Transfer on HO Gene Expression—Because HO-1 converts heme to equimolar amounts of CO and bilirubin, we measured HO activity by the formation of bilirubin in vessels obtained from rats transduced with the human HO-1 gene and compared with it to Ho activity in vessels of rats transduced with empty vector. HO activity in vessels transduced with empty viral vector was 0.59 ± 0.20 nmol of bilirubin formed/mg protein, similar to the control. However, HO activity was increased to 0.99 ± 0.16 nmol of bilirubin formed/mg protein in vessels obtained from rats transduced with the human HO-1 gene (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4A). Functional expression of the human HO-1 gene in control and diabetic rats was determined in rats receiving intracardiac delivery of retroviral-mediated human HO-1 vector (27Abraham N.G. Rezzani R. Rodella L. Kruger A. Taller D. Li V.G. Goodman A.I. Kappas A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2004; 287: H2468-H2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of aorta obtained from retroviral human HO-1 rats demonstrated a functional expression of human HO-1 proteins in control and in diabetic rats up to the entire 6-month duration of the experiments (Fig. 4B) in both control and diabetic rats. Neither rat HO-1 nor HO-2 was increased. Effect of Human HO-1 Gene Transfer on MCs—To define the effect of human HO-1 gene transfer on mitochondrial transporters, we measured mitochondrial ADP/ATP and deoxynucleotide carrier proteins in the aorta of control and diabetic rats. As expected, the induction of diabetes resulted in a significant decrease in ADP/ATP and deoxynucleotide carrier levels (Fig. 5). The selective increase in HO-1 by delivery of human HO-1 gene increased ADP/ATP and deoxynucleotide carrier proteins (Fig. 5). The ADP/ATP and deoxynucleotide to CYT IV protein ratios were significantly increased in transgenic rats overexpressing HO-1 (p < 0.005 and p < 0.02, versus STZ, respectively). The ADP/ATP and deoxynucleotide to CYT IV protein ratios were not significantly different in rats transduced with the retroviral vector (LXSN versus STZ). Effect of Diabetes and HO-1 on AKT, BcL-XL, and Bax—We examined the phosphorylation of AKT and the levels of anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins, BcL-XL and Bax, respectively, in control, diabetic, and CoPP-treated diabetic rats. As seen in Fig. 6A, AKT phosphorylation was not significantly altered in diabetics compared with controls animals. However, the extent of AKT phosphorylation was significantly greater in CoPP-treated rats compared with diabetic controls. Densitometry analysis showed that CoPP treatment increased the ratio of P-AKT/AKT from 0.68 ± 0.14 in STZ to 2.69 ± 0.38 in STZ-CoPP tissue (p < 0.02). The increase in p-AKT was abolished by inhibition of HO activity with the co-administration of SnMP to CoPP-treated diabetic rats (Fig. 6A). The total amount of AKT protein was not different between groups, i.e. control, diabetic, diabetic-treated with CoPP, diabetic-treated with CoPP plus SnMP. The endogenous levels of the anti-apoptotic protein, BcL-XL were decreased in diabetic rats (p < 0.05) when compared with control rats (Fig. 6). Up-regulation of HO-1 expression by CoPP resulted in the stimulation of BcL-XL in diabetic rats, (p < 0.001), which was prevented by the co-administration of SnMP, suggesting that increased in HO activity (i.e. production of CO and bilirubin) contributed to the increase in BcL-XL. There was no effect on Bax, a pro-apoptotic signaling pathway member. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the heme-HO system participates in the regulation of renal and vascular mitochondrial transport carriers, presumably by regulating the levels of bilirubin and CO, secondary to an increase in HO-1 expression and activity. We have demonstrated that the increase in MCs, as a result of the increase in HO-1 expression, is associated with a robust increase in cytochrome c oxidase activity, presumably by influencing the levels of phosphorylation of the AKT and BcL-XL proteins. Three key findings substantiate this conclusion. The first is that hyperglycemia decreased five of the MCs examined, i.e. carnitine, deoxynucleotide, dicarboxylate, phosphate, and ADP/ATP, without affecting the aspartate and oxoglutarate carriers. This decrease was associated with a reduction in HO-1-derived CO and bilirubin formation. The second key observation is that up-regulation of HO-1 by CoPP in diabetic and in control rats significantly increased the carnitine, citrate, phosphate, deoxynucleotide, dicarboxylate, and ADP/ATP carriers without affecting the aspartate and oxoglutarate carriers (Fig. 2). These observed effects of HO-1 on MCs appear to be dependent on the generation of CO and bilirubin, because an increase in HO-1 protein without an increase in HO activity, as seen in rats treated with SnMP, did not enhance MCs. Further, the increase in MCs following HO-1 expression was associated with an increase in cytochrome c oxidase activity. In addition, and more importantly, the direct delivery of HO-1 to diabetic rats resulted in the restoration of two of the MCs examined, ADP/ATP and deoxynucleotide (Fig. 5). This novel finding demonstrates the direct effect of HO-1 and HO activity on the enhancement of mitochondrial function and the electron transport system. MCs play a crucial role in intermediary metabolism (24Palmieri F. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 689-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), as seen by their decrease in restricted diets, and by the fact that mitochondrial dysfunction can be restored by refeeding (35Siculella L. Sabetta S. di Summa R. Leo M. Giudetti A.M. Palmieri F. Gnoni G.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The present study shows that the increase in HO activity by induction of HO-1 can restore the citrate transport carrier. Therefore, the observed changes in mitochondrial transporters following HO-1 gene expression, by pharmacological or genetic means, may attenuate diabetes-induced ROS by improvement in cytochrome c oxidase activity and in the mitochondrial transport systems. The third key observation is that the up-regulation of HO-1 in diabetic rats by CoPP restored the diabetes-mediated decrease in BcL-XL (Fig. 6) and greatly increased AKT phosphorylation; both are important factors in cell survival. Others have shown that an increase in AKT phosphorylation is critical to cell survival in diabetes (36Tsang A. Hausenloy D.J. Mocanu M.M. Carr R.D. Yellon D.M. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 37Varma S. Lal B.K. Zheng R. Breslin J.W. Saito S. Pappas P.J. Hobson Ii R.W. Duran W.N. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, increases in AKT phosphorylation and BcL-XL levels have been shown to prevent the loss of β-cells in diabetes (38Kowluru A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 39Dai C. Li Y. Yang J. Liu Y. J. Biol.

It is interesting to note that the alteration in mitochondrial function in vitro and in vivo has been shown to correlate with the levels of activation of AKT and BcL-2 family protein (23Bojunga J.

A decrease in BcL-2 family members has been suggested to contribute to apoptosis and the translocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to cytosol (23Bojunga J. Nowak D. Mitrou P.S. Hoelzer D.

Cell Neurosci. 2005; 28: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), promote association of hexokinase with the VDAC channel and, in so doing, promote VDAC closure, thus blocking release of cytochrome c (45Gottlob K. Majewski N. Kennedy S. Kandel E. Robey R.B. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1406-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). However, the cause of the diabetes-related decline in certain MCs and BcL-XL proteins remains to be clarified. The HO-1 product, bilirubin, has been shown to inhibit protein kinase C and NADPH oxidase activities (46Sano K. Nakamura H. Matsuo T. Pediatr. Res. 1985; 19: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, up-regulation of HO-1 gene expression was shown to decrease the availability of the heme-containing gp91 subunit necessary for NADPH oxidase activity andO2−) generation and to increase bilirubin formation (7Taille C.

Furthermore, a decrease in mitochondrial heme as a result of the increase in mitochondrial HO-1 activity may reduce fatty acid lipid peroxidation and enhance mitochondrial membrane resistance to oxidative stress. Cardiac mitochondrial damage, as seen in type I diabetes, was the result of a decrease in reduced glutathione and decreased state 3 in mitochondrial respiration (14Shen X. Zheng S. Thongboonkerd V. Xu M. Pierce Jr., W.M. Klein J.B. Epstein P.N. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 287: E896-E905Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In other studies, a deficiency in the deoxynucleotide carrier was associated with abnormal brain growth (47Rosenberg M.J. Agarwala R. Bouffard G. Davis J. Fiermonte G. Hilliard M.S. Koch T. Kalikin L.M. Makalowska I. Morton D.H. Petty E.M. Weber J.L. Palmieri F. Kelley R.I. Schaffer A.A. Biesecker L.G. Nat.

Berry G.T. Deleeuw S. Boxer J. Bonnefont J.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Diabetic complications have been shown to be related to abnormalities in mitochondrial function (14Shen X. Zheng S. Thongboonkerd V. Xu M. Pierce Jr., W.M. Klein J.B. Epstein P.N. Am. J. Physiol.

Wiernsperger N. Leverve X. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2179-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Therefore, up-regulation of HO-1 in the mitochondria or in the vicinity of mitochondrial membranes may be essential to modulate the redox state in favor of antioxidants and to enhance mitochondrial transport of substrates and metabolites. Our findings indicate, for the first time, that HO-1 prevents the hyperglycemia-mediated decrease in six mitochondrial transporters and restores cytochrome c oxidase activity. The mechanism by which up-regulation of HO-1 expression and activity stimulates the MCs may be via an increase in phosphorylation of AKT and in anti-apoptotic molecules such as BcL-XL. Thus, pharmacological or genetic probes to enhance HO-1 gene expression enable the vascular system to mount an important host defense response to resist diabetes-mediated increases in oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2085559675,"The Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is a transcription factor that regulates cellular signaling involved in cell proliferation and oncogenesis. Here, we report that KLF5 interacts with tumor suppressor p53 in regulating the expression of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein survivin, which may play a role in pathological process of cancer. The core promoter region of survivin contains multiple GT-boxes that have been characterized as KLF5 response elements. Deletion and mutation analyses as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation and electronic mobility shift assay indicated that KLF5 binds to the core survivin promoter and strongly induces its activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that KLF5 protein is able to bind to p53 and abrogate the p53-regulated repression of survivin. Transfection of KLF5 into a KLF5-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line EU-8 enhanced survivin expression, and conversely, silencing of KLF5 by small interfering RNA in a KLF5-overexpressing acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line EU-4 down-regulated survivin expression. The KLF5 small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of survivin sensitized EU-4 cells to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. These findings identify a novel regulatory pathway for the expression of survivin under the control of KLF5 and p53. Deregulation of this pathway may result in overexpression of survivin in cancer, thus contributing to drug resistance.

Deregulation of this pathway may result in overexpression of survivin in cancer, thus contributing to drug resistance. Survivin is a unique member of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein family. It plays an important role not only in inhibiting apoptosis but also in regulating mitosis (1Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar, 2Li F. Ackermann E.J. Bennett C.F. Rothermel A.L. Plescia J. Tognin S. Villa A. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nat.

Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). High levels of survivin expression have been associated with cancer progression, drug resistance, poor prognosis, and short patient survival (4Li F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 197: 8-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 5Rodel F. Hoffmann J. Distel L. Herrmann M. Noisternig T. Papadopoulos T. Sauer R. Rodel C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4881-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). On the other hand, inhibition of survivin expression or interference with survivin function has been demonstrated to reduce cancer cell growth, induce cancer cell death, and sensitize cancer cells to radiation or chemotherapy (6Olie R.A.

Therefore, survivin is regarded as a promising target for cancer treatment, and modulating the expression of survivin seems to be one important approach. Much effort has been made to explore the mechanisms by which survivin expression is regulated. It is well established that survivin expression is repressed by wild-type p53 (8Hoffman W.H. Biade S.

Findley H.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), while how survivin expression is activated remains less clear. Recent studies in colon cancer cells suggest that regulation of survivin expression is at least partially T-cell factor (TCF)/β-catenin-dependent (11Zhang T. Otevrel T. Gao Z. Ehrlich S.M. Fields J.Z. Boman B.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8664-8667PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kim P.J. Plescia J. Clevers H. Fearon E.R. Altieri D.C.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3619-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a previous study to analyze the basal transcriptional requirement of survivin gene expression has indicated that the survivin gene promoter contains GC-rich sequences, and the Sp1 transcription factor induces survivin expression in HeLa cells (14Li F. Altieri D.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In addition to GC-rich sequences, the core promoter of survivin contains multiple CACCC or GGGTG motifs (also called GT-boxes) for Sp1-like proteins and Kruppel-like factors (Sp/KLF) 3The abbreviations used are: KLF, Kruppel-like factor; CHIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; EMSA, electronic mobility shift assay; ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; BCP, B-cell precursor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; siRNA, small interfering RNA. . The Sp/KLF family contains at least 20 members with highly related zinc finger proteins that are important components of the eukaryotic cellular transcriptional machinery (15Kaczynski J. Cook T. Urrutia R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Individual members of the Sp/KLF family have preferences for binding different DNA sequences in the target gene promoter. For example, Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 bind with higher affinity to GC-boxes than to GT-boxes, whereas many of the KLF proteins bind preferentially to GT-boxes over GC-boxes (16Hagen G. Denning J. Preiss A. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 17Matsumoto N. Laub F. Aldabe R. Zhang W. Ramirez F. Yoshida T. Terada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28229-28237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Sp/KLF can function as activators or repressors depending on which promoter they bind and the co-regulators with which they interact. Although the Sp/KLF family is considered a major transcriptional activator for survivin expression, the ability of individual members of this family, and in particular those binding GT-boxes, to regulate survivin transcription in a given cell type has not been evaluated. Previous studies have suggested that members of the Sp/KLF family can interact with oncogenes and tumor suppressors, they can be oncogenic themselves, and altered expression of family members has been detected in tumors (18Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Recently, attention has been given to the involvement of Sp/KLF family member KLF5 in oncogenesis. KLF5 is also known as basic transcription element-binding protein 2 (BTEB2) and intestine-enriched Kruppel-like factor (IKLF). Although KLF5 expression was originally found in gut and epithelial tissues, recent studies showed that KLF5 is also expressed in other types of tissues and cells such as skin, vascular smooth muscle cells, and lymphoid cells (19Sur I. Unden A.B. Toftgard R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Hoshino Y. Kurabayashi M. Kanda T. Hasegawa A. Sakamoto H. Okamoto E. Kowase K. Watanabe N.

Blood. 2003; 101: 4492-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In lymphoid cells, KLF5 is expressed most highly in pro-T-cell and at much lower levels in normal thymus and bone marrow (21Yang X.O. Doty R.T. Hicks J.S. Willerford D.M. Blood. 2003; 101: 4492-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). KLF5 is expressed mainly in proliferating cells and its expression is inducible (22Ohnishi S. Laub F. Matsumoto N. Asaka M. Ramirez F. Yoshida T. Terada M. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Ogata T. Kurabayashi M. Hoshino Y. Sekiguchi K. Ishikawa S. Morishita Y. Nagai R. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 2000; 119: 983-989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). KLF5 as a transcription factor activates expression of genes such as SM22α and γ-globin through GGGTG or CACCC motif within the gene promoters (24Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J.

Cancer. 2005; 118: 1346-1355Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that KLF5 is a positive regulator of cell proliferation and mediates cell survival and tumorigenesis. In the present study, we examined the expression of KLF5 in leukemia bone marrow cells from children with ALL as well as in a panel of leukemia cell lines derived from pediatric ALL. We found that KLF5 is widely expressed in both ALL lines and fresh ALL samples and that KLF5 expression is consistently associated with high levels of survivin expression in this disease. By analyzing the survivin promoter activity, we further found that KLF5 is an stimulator for survivin expression and that tumor suppressor p53 can down-regulate survivin expression by binding to KLF5. These findings suggest that KLF5 may be a novel target for therapy of ALL and other tumors with inactivated p53. Patient Cells and Cell Line—Bone marrow aspirates were studied from 11 patients with B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL, diagnosed by standard immunologic, morphologic, and cytochemical criteria. Mononuclear cells were separated by centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque (1.077 g/ml), washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended at 106/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were incubated on plastic Petri dishes for 1 h at 37°C to remove monocytes, and nonadherent cells were recovered by gently washing the dishes. All specimens for studies of gene expression contained more than 90% blasts following purification. Six BCP-ALL lines were used in this study. The Reh line was obtained from C. Rosenfeld (INSERM, Villejuif, France). The five EU cell lines were established in our laboratory from pediatric BCP-ALL patients. Cultured cells resembled the primary leukemic cells, with Reh, EU-1, and EU-3 expressing wild-type p53, EU-2 expressing mutant p53, and EU-4 and EU-8 lacking p53 expression (30Zhou M. Yeager A.M. Smith S.D. Findley H.W. Blood. 1995; 85: 1608-1614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lines were grown in standard culture medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 50 units of penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in 5% CO2-in air. Plasmids—The expression plasmid containing KLF5 (pCDNA3.1-KLF5) was constructed in our laboratory as described previously (31Chen C. Bhalala H.V. Qiao H. Dong J.T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6567-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid containing KLF4 (pMT3-KLF4) was kindly provided by Dr. V. Yang (Emory University). The Sp1 expression plasmid (pPacSp1) was provided by Dr. L. S. Phillips (Emory University). The wild-type p53 expression plasmid (pc53-SN3) was provided by Dr B. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University). The KLF6 expression plasmid was generated by inserting a cDNA fragment synthesized by reverse transcription-PCR into the pcDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen) at the HindIII and XhoI sites. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed using total RNA extracted from EU-1 cells and primer pair 5′-CCCGACATGGACGTGCT-3′ and 5′CTCCCTCAGAGGTGCCT-3′ designed from the KLF6 gene. Various 5′-3′ deletion constructs and site-directed mutants of the survivin promoter were made. For construction of the putative survivin promoter deletion constructs pLuc-689, pLuc-269, pLuc-150, pLuc-110, pLuc-96, and pLuc-67, PCR primer pairs were determined from the corresponding sites in the sequence of the full-length survivin promoter. Mutant pLuc-269m and pLuc-110m constructs, made using mutated nested primers at the G and T residues within the GT-boxes, strongly interfered with binding to KLF5. Mutated promoter fragments were made by site-directed mutagenesis using in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). Constructs including different deleted or mutated fragments were then ligated to the pGL3 basic vector. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm that the sequence of the PCR products were correct as compared with the survivin promoter as published in the Human Genome data base. Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assay—Gene transfections were performed to analyze the effect of KLF5 on survivin expression. EU-4 or EU-8 cells in exponential growth were transfected or co-transfected with plasmids as described above by electroporation at 280–300 V, 950 microfarads using a Gene Pulser II system (Bio-Rad). For stable transfection, the cells were seeded 48 h post-transfection into culture dishes for the selection of G418-resistant colonies. For gene reporter assay, cells were transiently co-transfected by electroporation with the survivin promoter-luciferase constructs and different expression plasmids. Briefly, 1 × 107 cells in exponential growth were mixed with the corresponding survivin promoter-luciferase constructs plus different doses of p53, KLF4, KLF5, KLF6, and Sp1 plasmids and electroporated as described above. Transfected cells were resuspended in 10 ml of RPMI containing 10% FBS. At 48 h post-transfection, cell extracts were prepared with 1 × lysis buffer, and then 20-μl aliquots of the supernatant were mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and analyzed on a Microplate Luminometer (Turner Designs). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity as an internal control. CHIP Assay—The CHIP assay as described previously (32Gu L. Findley H.W. Zhou M. Blood. 2002; 99: 3367-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was performed to analyze the DNA binding activity of KLF5 protein. EU-4 cells, which express high level of KLF5, were used for CHIP assay for the in vivo binding of KLF5 to survivin promoter. First, formaldehyde was added at 1% to the culture media, and cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min with mild shaking to cross-link KLF5 protein to the survivin promoter. Then, cells (1 × 106) were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. After a brief sonication, lysates were cleared by centrifugation and were diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 167 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors as above. Anti-KLF5 or control antibodies were added at 4 °C overnight with rotation. Immunoprecipitated complexes were collected by protein A/G plus-agarose. Precipitants were sequentially washed with low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), once, respectively, followed by two washes with 1 × TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). After the final wash, 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) was added and incubated at room temperature for 15 min with rotation. Then 5 m NaCl was added to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking by heating at 65 °C for 4 h. After precipitation with ethanol, the pellets were resuspended and treated with proteinase K. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Pellets were resuspended in TE buffer and subjected to PCR amplification using forward and reverse primers (5′-GATTACAGGCGTGAGCCACT-3′ and 5′-ATCTGGCGGTTAATGGCGCG-3′) selected from the survivin core promoter sequence (–253 to –234 and –11 to +10, respectively). A pair of primers (5′-GGATATATTCAAGCTGGG-3′ and 5′-GGTGTCCACCTGGACCTG-3′) selected from upstream sequence of survivin core promoter (–2750 to –2733 and –2409 to –2392, respectively) served as control. The PCR product was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. EMSA—Sequence-specific DNA binding activity of KLF5 to survivin promoter was assayed by EMSA. Nuclear protein extraction was prepared using a kit (NE-PER™ from Pierce). Nuclear protein (5 μg) from EU-4 cells, which express high level of KLF5, was incubated for 15 min in a binding buffer (10 mm Tri-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5 mm MgCl) plus 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC) carrier, and 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe 5′-GCGGGGGGTGGACCGCCTAA-3′ spanning the –61/–40 of survivin promoter that contains the third GT box. A mutated probe with changes of the GGGTG core consensus from GT to CA served as control. Anti-KLF5 and rabbit IgG antibodies as additional controls were used to supershift the specific complexes of interest by pretreating the extract for 1 h at 4 °C with antibodies. The samples were electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and developed with intensifier screen at –70 °C. KLF5 siRNA and Transfection—The siRNA was designed to target KLF5 mRNA. Its target sequence was 5′-AAAGTATAGACGAGACAGTGC-3′. A scrambled siRNA was used as a control. EU-4 cells were transfected with 50–200 nm of chemically synthesized siRNA (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL) using Lipofectamine™ Reagent (Invitrogen) in 12-well plates. Briefly, EU-4 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 per well and cultured for overnight. The siRNA solution was then mixed with Lipofectamine™ Reagent in Opti-MEM I media for 20 min following the manufacturer's protocol and was added to EU-4 cells in a total volume of 0.5 ml. After 4-h incubation, 1 ml of normal medium was added to the cell culture. Northern Blot Assay—Total RNA (10 μg per lane) was electrophoresed using a 1% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon filter. Probes were prepared by a randomized-labeling approach using [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridization was performed in 50% (v/v) formamide, 5 × SSC, 1% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 20% dextran sulfate, 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C for 16 h. A final wash was carried out in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. After washing, the filter was autoradiographed for 24 h. Western Blot Assay—Cells were lysed in a buffer composed of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20μg/ml aprotinin, and 25μg/ml leupeptin for 30 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein extracts (10 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filter. After blocking with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 500 mm NaCl, 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature, the filter was incubated with specific antibodies for 3 h at room temperature. After washing, the filter was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody for 1 h. Blots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. After centrifugation, 30 μg of the clarified cell lysate was incubated with 15 μl protein G plus/protein A-agarose and 1 μg of p53, KLF5, or MDM2 antibodies, respectively. After 24-h incubation, the agarose was centrifuged, washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer, suspended in electrophoresis sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The immunoprecipitated protein was further analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Determination of Cell Growth Rate—KLF5 siRNA-transfected EU-4 cells and control cells (EU-4 transfected with irrelevant siRNA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS at an initial concentration of 104/ml. Cells were then counted using a hemocytometer under light microscope. Triplicate flasks were counted for each time point to determine the growth rate. Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis Assays—The effect of KLF5 siRNA on doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in EU-4 cells was determined by the WST assay. Briefly, cells were cultured in 96-well microtitre plates with different concentrations of doxorubicin for 44 h. WST (25 μg/well) was then added, and cells were incubated for an additional 4 h. The OD of the wells was then read with a microplate reader at a test wavelength of 450 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 nm. Appropriate controls lacking cells were included to determine background absorbance. An annexin-V assay (Oncogene, San Diego, CA) was used to quantitate apoptotic cells. Briefly, cells with or without treatment were washed once with PBS and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-annexin-V and PI for 30 min according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stained cells were detected using the FACScan (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using WinList software (Verity Software House Inc). KLF5 Is Widely Expressed in ALL, and Its Expression Is Associated with Survivin Expression—Although KLF5 is involved in cell proliferation and cancer, the expression of this gene has not been studied in many human cancers including leukemia. We examine the expression of KLF5 in primary ALL cells and ALL cell lines derived from pediatric patients by northern blotting. KLF5 mRNA was expressed in all 11 freshly isolated ALL specimens, and five of six ALL cell lines, although the levels of expression varied among different samples and cell lines (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the expression of KLF5 appeared related to the expression of survivin in ALL. The ALL line EU-8 lacking KLF5 expression also expressed a very low level of survivin, and furthermore, several patient's samples (unique patient numbers 1–4) expressing relatively low levels of KLF5 expressed reduced survivin. However, the expression of KLF5 in normal peripheral lymphocytes was not related to survivin, with a relatively high level of KLF5 expression and low level of survivin tested from one donor. To further confirm the association between KLF5 and survivin expression in ALL, we performed gene transfection of KLF5 into EU-8 line. Enforced expression of both KLF5 mRNA and protein in EU-8 cells was detected by northern blotting (Fig. 1B) and Western blotting (Fig. 1C), respectively. As also shown in Fig. 1, B and C, the expression of both survivin mRNA and protein was significantly increased in EU-8 cells transfected with KLF5 compared with untransfected cells or cells transfected with a control vector. KLF5 Is a Positive Regulator of Survivin Promoter Activity—Since the core promoter of survivin contains multiple GT-boxes (GGGTG or CACCC, Fig. 2) that are preferentially used for binding and responding to KLF proteins, we determined the role of GT-boxes within the core promoter of survivin in regulating promoter activity in ALL cells. We generated a series of 5′-3′ deleted and mutated constructs of this region and performed transfection and gene reporter assays in EU-4 cells, which express high level of KLF5. Our results showed that GT-boxes mediated the majority of the promoter activity. When the three GT-boxes were mutated, the activity of the promoter construct pLuc-269 containing the core survivin promoter was only about one-fourth of the wild-type promoter activity (Fig. 3, pLuc-269m versus pLuc-269). Significantly, the third GT-box (–56/–52) regulated approximately half of the total promoter activity in EU-4 as shown in Fig. 3, in which the activity of construct pLuc-110 containing only the third GT-box was ∼50% of total promoter (pLuc-689 and pLuc-269) activity, and the construct pLuc-96 with deletion of the only third GT-box showed almost no promoter activity as compared with control. Regulation of the survivin promoter by the third GT-box was further confirmed by mutation assay, in which the promoter construct pLuc-110m containing a mutation in the third GT-box expressed no promoter activity.FIGURE 3Deletion and mutation analysis of the survivin core promoter activity. A, schematic representation of survivin promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids: pLuc-689 and pLuc-269 containing the core promoter region; pLuc-150, pLuc-110, pLuc-96, pLuc-67, containing a series of 5′-3′ deleted promoters; and pLuc-110m and pLuc-269m containing promoters with the putative KLF5 response elements mutated by site-directed mutagenesis (▪). B, transient transfection and luciferase assay in EU-4 ALL cells, which express high level of KLF5. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of either survivin promoter constructs or control plasmid (pGL3 basic). Electroporation was performed at 300 V, 950 μF. At 48 h post-transfection, cell extracts were analyzed for luciferase activity. Data represent the mean of three independent experiments normalized toβ-galactosidase activity; bars, ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the GT-box is the response element for Sp/KLF family proteins, we tested whether KLF5 but not other members of this family specifically induces survivin promoter activity in ALL cells. We performed co-transfection of the deleted survivin promoter construct pLuc-110 with the expression plasmids KLF5 and several Sp/KLF members Sp1, KLF4, and KLF6 in EU-8 line. The expression plasmid of p53 was also included in this study. As shown in Fig. 4A, co-transfection of KLF5 significantly (up to 4-fold) increased the activity of pLuc-110 promoter construct containing only the third GT box. Co-transfecton of KLF4, KLF6, and Sp1 neither increased nor decreased luciferase activity of the pLuc-110 construct, although a slight increase and decrease of pLuc-110 activity were observed following Sp1 and KLF4 transfection, respectively. Consistent with our previous results, p53 repressed survivin promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). As also shown in Fig. 4B, the p53 repression of pLuc-110 activity was abrogated by co-transfection with KLF5. To further investigate the role of the GT boxes in the survivin promoter in regulating the promoter activity in response to KLF5, we performed EMSA as well as CHIP analyses to evaluate the binding capacity of KLF5 to survivin promoter. Results from both CHIP (Fig. 5A) and EMSA (Fig. 5B) indicated that KLF5 induced survivin promoter activity by directly binding to the GT boxes in the promoter. KLF5 Interacts with p53 in Regulating Survivin Expression—Results shown in Fig. 4B, in which KLF5 abrogated p53-repressed survivin promoter activity, suggest that a possible interaction between p53 and KLF5 mediates survivin expression. Therefore, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay to analyze binding between p53 and KLF5. From the data presented in Fig. 6A, it can be seen that p53 and KLF5 were able to bind each other in Reh cells expressing endogenous p53 and KLF5 and in EU-8 cells expressing transfected p53 and KLF5. The binding of p53 to MDM2 in Reh cells was detected in the control, whereas binding of KLF5 to MDM2 was not detected. To further confirm that the physical interacti"

However, recent studies have shown that, although not essential for basal transcription by purified RNA polymerase II (pol II) and general initiation factors, Mediator is essential for basal transcription in nuclear extracts that contain a more physiological complement of factors (Mittler, G., Kremmer, E., Timmers, H. T., and Meisterernst, M. (2001) EMBO Rep. 2, 808–813; Baek, H. J., Malik, S., Qin, J., and Roeder, R. G. (2002) Mol. Cell. Biol. 22, 2842–2852). Here, mechanistic studies with immobilized DNA templates, purified factors, and factor-depleted HeLa extracts have shown (i) that Mediator enhancement of basal transcription correlates with Mediator-dependent recruitment of pol II and general initiation factors (transcription factor (TF) IIB and TFIIE) to the promoter; (ii) that Mediator and TFIIB, which both interact with pol II, are jointly required for pol II recruitment to the promoter and that TFIIB recruitment is Mediator-dependent, whereas Mediator recruitment is TFIIB-independent; (iii) that a high level of TFIIB can bypass the Mediator requirement for basal transcription and pol II recruitment in nuclear extract, thus indicating a conditional restriction of TFIIB function and a key role of Mediator in overcoming this restriction; and (iv) that an earlier rate-limiting step involves formation of a TFIID-Mediator-promoter complex. These results support a stepwise assembly model, rather than a preformed holoenzyme model, for Mediator-dependent assembly of a basal preinitiation complex and, more important, identify a step involving TFIIB as a key site of action of Mediator. The multisubunit Mediator is a well established transcription coactivator for gene-specific activators.

These results support a stepwise assembly model, rather than a preformed holoenzyme model, for Mediator-dependent assembly of a basal preinitiation complex and, more important, identify a step involving TFIIB as a key site of action of Mediator. The transcription of eukaryotic genes is mediated by functional interactions of the general transcription machinery with common core promoter (e.g. TATA) elements and further regulated by gene-specific factors bound to distal regulatory elements (1Lee T.I. Young R.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 77-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Studies with purified factors have demonstrated that pol II 4The abbreviations used are: pol II, RNA polymerase II; TF, transcription factor; PIC, preinitiation complex; CTD, C-terminal domain; TAF, TATA box-binding protein-associated factor; TBP, TATA box-binding protein; GTFs, general transcription factors. and cognate initiation factors TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH (general transcription machinery) are necessary and sufficient for robust basal (activator-independent) transcription from TATA-containing DNA templates and that the formation of a functional PIC involves the ordered stepwise assembly of these factors (2Roeder R.G.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). In contrast, activator-dependent transcription from DNA templates was found to require additional cofactors, the most prominent of which is the multisubunit Mediator complex, which is conserved from yeast to human (4Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 256-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 5Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), along with later demonstrations of direct interactions with activators (4Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 256-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 8Fondell J.D. Ge H. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8329-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), led to the notion that Mediator serves as a bridge between DNA-binding regulatory factors and the general transcription machinery to facilitate formation and/or function of the PIC (4Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 256-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 5Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Various biochemical and genetic studies have substantiated this view. Despite its paramount role in activator-dependent transcription, Mediator also has been implicated in basal transcription events by both biochemical and genetic assays. Thus, consistent with the ability of yeast Mediator to enhance basal transcription in a purified system (7Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), mutations in Mediator subunits were shown to eliminate or reduce basal transcription in crude nuclear extracts (9Koleske A.J. Buratowski S. Nonet M. Young R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 883-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This is consistent with genetic studies implicating yeast Mediator in transcription of essentially all genes in yeast (11Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Similarly, human Mediator has also been shown to be essential for basal transcription in nuclear extracts (12Mittler G. Kremmer E. Timmers H.T. Meisterernst M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Baek H.J. Malik S. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2842-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As nuclear extracts contain a more natural complement of cellular factors, these assays likely give a more accurate reflection of Mediator requirements in living cells and support the emerging view that Mediator functions as a general transcription factor under more physiological assay conditions. The mechanism(s) by which Mediator facilitates basal transcription remain to be fully understood and could include direct or indirect functions at any of the steps (PIC formation, promoter melting, initiation, promoter clearance, etc.) leading to productive transcription (3Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The isolation of stable Mediator-pol II (holoenzyme) complexes, initially in yeast (6Thompson C.M.

Cell. 2005; 19: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggested the possibility of Mediator recruitment to, and possible stabilization of, the PIC through Mediator-pol II interactions. A role for Mediator in basal PIC formation or function was also suggested by the ability of yeast Mediator to enhance TFIIH-mediated phosphorylation of the pol II CTD (7Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) and an associated CTD requirement both for basal transcription in yeast and mammalian nuclear extracts (17Nair D. Kim Y. Myers L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33739-33748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and for formation (activator-dependent) of the PIC in yeast nuclear extracts (10Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Consistent with the demonstration of cooperativity between human Mediator and TAF components of TFIID in basal transcription in nuclear extracts (13Baek H.J. Malik S. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2842-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), human TFIID and Mediator have been reported to act cooperatively in activator-dependent PIC assembly (18Johnson K.M. Wang J. Smallwood A. Arayata C. Carey M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1852-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These observations, along with structural studies of the transcription machinery (19Asturias F.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), are consistent with the view that Mediator interactions with pol II and general initiation factors may facilitate formation and possibly function (initiation, promoter clearance) of the PIC. A recent study has demonstrated activator-independent (basal) functions of Mediator in both PIC formation and re-initiation in yeast extracts (20Reeves W.M. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Still unexplained when this study initiated was why basal transcription from DNA templates absolutely requires Mediator in assays with nuclear extracts, but not in assays with purified factors. A direct positive role has been suggested by the recently demonstrated ability of Mediator to stimulate basal transcription (4Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 256-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 7Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D.

Chem. 2005; 280: 33739-33748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in basal transcription assays reconstituted with purified factors. In contrast, an indirect anti-repression effect was suggested from yeast genetic studies in which negative cofactors (NC2 and Not1) that inhibit the general transcription machinery were isolated as suppressors of a mutant Mediator subunit (22Gadbois E.L. Chao D.M. Reese J.C. Green M.R. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3145-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Lee T.I. Wyrick J.J. Koh S.S. Jennings E.G. Gadbois E.L. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4455-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although a recent study with yeast nuclear extract failed to show Mediator effects through Not1 and NC2 complexes (24Takagi Y. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 80-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), it did not eliminate possible effects through other known (25Lee T.I. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1398-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 26Sims III, R.J. Belotserkovskaya R. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2437-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) or unknown factors that may place constraints on PIC formation or function. Another question of importance in relation to Mediator function and potential targets is whether the poorly characterized basal PIC assembly pathway in nuclear extracts is identical to the pathway established with purified factors. The latter involves TATA element recognition by TBP, generally in the context of TFIID and with possible stabilization by TFIIA, with subsequent sequential binding of TFIIB (to TBP), TFIIF-pol II (to TFIIB), TFIIE (to pol II), and TFIIH (to TFIIE) (2Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 3Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). In this pathway, pol II recruitment is critically dependent upon prior binding of TFIIB to the TBP/TFIID-promoter complex, whereas TFIID-Mediator and Mediator-pol II interactions (see above) might possibly result in less of a dependence on TFIIB for pol II recruitment in nuclear extracts. Thus, and relevant to this study, there could be some redundancy or cooperativity between TFIIB and Mediator in PIC formation. Related studies of activator-driven PIC assembly in yeast extracts have argued in favor of a holoenzyme model (6Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) involving joint interdependent recruitment of pol II, Mediator, and a subset of general initiation factors (10Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), although cell-based chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have clearly shown that Mediator and pol II are not simultaneously recruited on at least some genes (27Cosma M.P. Panizza S. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1213-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28Bhoite L.T. Yu Y. Stillman D.J.

Cell. 2001; 8: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this study, we used immobilized template assays in conjunction with purified factors and factor-depleted nuclear extracts to investigate the PIC assembly pathway and basis of the Mediator requirement for basal transcription in extracts from human cells. Our results demonstrate a Mediator function in basal PIC formation that surprisingly involves facilitated recruitment of TFIIB. They further demonstrate a rate-limiting step in basal transcription that appears to involve formation of a TFIID-Mediator-promoter complex. Purified Factors—Bacterially expressed histidine-tagged TBP was purified through sequential nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and heparin-Sepharose chromatography (30Malik S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 364: 257-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged TFIIB was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (30Malik S. Roeder R.G.

Mediator(f: NUT2) and Mediator(f:TRAP220AB) were isolated from FLAG epitope-tagged MED10/NUT2- and MED1/TRAP220AB-expressing cell lines, respectively (31Malik S. Gu W. Wu W. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol.

Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 364: 257-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) at 0.5 ml/ml. Immobilized templates were prepared fresh before each experiment. In Vitro Transcription with Immobilized Templates—Transcription reactions were carried out in two steps. First, preincubation reactions were set up and contained (in a final volume of 25 μl) 2 μl of immobilized template, 500 ng of sonicated Escherichia coli DNA, 4 μl of HeLa nuclear extract (at ∼10 mg/ml), 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.2), 11–16% glycerol, 4 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 units of RNasin (Promega). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, and immobilized templates were washed three times with 300 μl of transcription buffer. Second, these immobilized templates were further incubated in 25-μl reactions containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.2), 11–16% glycerol, 4 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm each ATP and CTP, 5 μm UTP, 0.1 mm 3′-O-methyl-GTP, 16 μCi (0.6 MBq) of [α-32P]UTP, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 units of RNasin. These reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, at which time the UTP concentration was increased to 25 μm, and 15 units of RNase T1 were added. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were extracted with phenol/chloroform in the presence of 150 μl of stop solution (0.4 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 13 mm EDTA, 0.33% SDS, and 0.67 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The aqueous layer was precipitated by ethanol and analyzed by gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Correctly initiated transcripts were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis using a GE Healthcare STORM 840 system. Analysis of Proteins on Immobilized Templates—For analysis of proteins bound to immobilized templates, scaled-up (100 μl) transcription reactions were used. After incubation of extract with immobilized templates, the templates were concentrated by centrifugation and washed three times with 300 μl of transcription buffer. Templates were resuspended in 50 μl of Buffer 3 (New England Biolabs) with 60 units of EcoRI. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with constant agitation, the supernatants were collected on compact reaction columns (USB Corp.). Proteins in the supernatants were concentrated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and then redissolved in 1× SDS loading buffer. After boiling, samples were resolved on 4–16% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Time Course Assays—Immobilized DNA templates were prepared as described above with minor modifications for convenience of handling. Streptavidin-coupled M-280 Dynabeads (Dynal) were concentrated by Dynal MPC-S and washed twice with 300 μl of Buffer T supplemented with 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Beads were resuspended in Buffer T at 5 μg/ml and incubated with 10 fmol of biotinylated template/μg of beads in Buffer T for 30 min at room temperature with constant agitation. The immobilized templates were concentrated by MPC-S and washed three times with 300 μl of Buffer T. The immobilized templates were blocked in block buffer (0.5 μl/μg of beads) for 15 min at room temperature with constant agitation. The beads were concentrated by MPC-S, washed three times with transcription buffer, and resuspended in BC100 at 0.1 ml/μg. This immobilized template was incubated with HeLa nuclear extract for time t. After washing the immobilized template twice with transcription buffer, either transcription was initiated by addition of NTPs, or bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunodepletion of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts depleted of Mediator (referred to as NE(ΔMED)) or TFIID and Mediator (NE(ΔIID/ ΔMED)) were prepared as described (13Baek H.J. Malik S. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2842-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For preparation of nuclear extract lacking TFIIB (NE(ΔIIB)), 200μl of anti-TFIIB antisera (provided by Dr. Sohail Malik) were purified on 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and then cross-linked with dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma). HeLa nuclear extract (100 μl) in BC100 was incubated with anti-TFIIB antibody-protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 4 h. The supernatant was collected, and the immunoprecipitate was eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5) after extensive washing with BC100. The supernatant and eluate were analyzed by immunoblotting. Nuclear extract lacking TFIIB, TFIID, and Mediator (NE(ΔIIB/ΔIID/ΔMED)) was similarly prepared from NE(ΔIID/ΔMED). pol II, TFIIB, and TFIIE Are Recruited to a TATA-containing Promoter in a Mediator-dependent Manner—Whereas pol II and general transcription factors suffice for robust basal transcription in purified systems (2Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 3Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), basal transcription in a crude HeLa nuclear extract-based transcription system requires, in addition, human Mediator, as shown in other studies (12Mittler G. Kremmer E. Timmers H.T. Meisterernst M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Baek H.J. Malik S. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2842-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because PIC assembly is an essential and generally rate-limiting step in the overall transcription reaction (33Dvir A. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34Fiedler U. Timmers H.T.M. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we first investigated the possibility that Mediator enhances basal transcription in the nuclear extract assay by contributing to PIC assembly. To this end, we employed an immobilized template assay (10Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) that allows, after template incubation with nuclear extract and subsequent washing, assessment of both bound factors (by immunoblotting) and transcription activity (by incubation with nucleoside triphosphates). To avoid the problem of substantial TATA-independent binding of endogenous TFIID and Mediator under basal transcription assay conditions (data not shown) and to assess the requirement for Mediator in PIC formation, we employed NE(ΔIID/ΔMED) supplemented with TBP and variably with highly purified Mediator. The TFIID- and Mediator-depleted extract has been described previously (13Baek H.J. Malik S. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2842-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and the affinity-purified Mediator(f:TRAP220AB) (32Malik S. Guermah M. Yuan C.X. Wu W. Yamamura S. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8244-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and Mediator(f:NUT2) (31Malik S. Gu W. Wu W. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) preparations used in this study are shown in Fig. 1B. As shown in Fig. 1C, TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, and pol II, as well as ectopic Mediator, were recruited to the promoter in a TATA-dependent manner (lane 3 versus lane 2). Very significantly, recruitment of TFIIB, TFIIE, and pol II was completely dependent upon the presence of Mediator (lane 4 versus lane 3). Recruitment of complete Mediator, rather than the PC2-CRSP complex that lacks the CDK8 module (31Malik S. Gu W. Wu W. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), is indicated by recruitment of MED12/TRAP230 along with core subunits MED6, MED17/TRAP80, and MED30/TRAP25. Under the conditions of the assay, TFIIF and TFIIH bound to the immobilized template in the absence of either Mediator (lane 4) or an intact TATA element (lane 2). This likely reflects the nonspecific DNA binding activities of these factors and has precluded assessment in this study of the possible Mediator dependence of their recruitment to the PIC at the TATA element. Nonetheless, the results clearly indicate that, in the nuclear extract context, Mediator plays an important role in recruitment to the basal promoter of key components (minimally TFIIB, TFIIE, and pol II) of the PIC. Mediator-dependent Basal Transcription Activity in Nuclear Extracts Correlates with Mediator-dependent Recruitment of Factors to the PIC—A corresponding analysis of the transcription activity of the PIC assembled on the immobilized template revealed a close correlation with the factor binding results. Thus, basal transcription showed an almost complete (49-fold) dependence upon an intact TATA element (Fig. 1D, lane 3 versus lane 2) and a >5-fold dependence upon Mediator (lane 3 versus lane 4), clearly reflecting the TATA- and Mediator-dependent recruitment of pol II and the GTFs observed in Fig. 1C. However, because these assays contained TBP in place of TFIID for technical reasons (see above) and because TAFs contribute to basal transcription in nuclear extracts (13Baek H.J. Malik S. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2842-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), these results may underestimate the true contribution of Mediator to basal transcription. To confirm and extend the single time point correlation between transcription factor recruitment and transcription activity, we compared the temporal recruitment of transcription factors with the temporal acquisition of transcription activity according to the scheme in Fig. 2A. This analysis employed a Mediator-depleted nuclear extract supplemented with purified Mediator(f:TRAP220AB) to avoid the nonspecific binding activity of endogenous Mediator. As shown in Fig. 2 (B and C), the transcription activity of the immobilized template complex increased linearly (up to 8-fold in 32 min) with the time t of preincubation (prior to washing) with the nuclear extract. As shown in Fig. 2D, the recruitment of TFIIB, TFIIE, pol II, and Mediator showed comparable increases (4–8-fold) over the same time period. In contrast and for reasons (nonspecific DNA binding) described above, TFIIH and TBP/TFIID showed constitutively high binding. The close correlation between the temporal formation of functional PICs (exhibiting transcription activity) and the temporal recruitment of Mediator and key PIC components again supports the hypothesis that Mediator-dependent recruitment of PIC components governs the level of basal transcription in a nuclear extract. Mediator Contributes to Activator-dependent Transcription through Enhanced Recruitment of GTFs—The above experiments investigated how Mediator contributes to basal transcription. If this is attributed, as suggested, to Mediator-dependent recruitment of GTFs such as pol II, TFIIB, and TFIIE, the same molecular mechanism might also be relevant to the previously reported role of Mediator in transcription activation by DNA-binding regulatory factors (4Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 256-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Indeed, previous studies have documented activ"
https://openalex.org/W2063060952,"Streptococcus pneumoniae, a human pathogen, is naturally capable of colonizing the upper airway and sometimes disseminating to remote tissue sites. Previous studies have shown that S. pneumoniae is able to evade complement-mediated innate immunity by recruiting complement factor H (FH), a complement alternative pathway inhibitor. Pneumococcal binding to FH has been attributed to choline-binding protein A (CbpA) of S. pneumoniae and its allelic variants, all of which are surface-exposed proteins. In this study, we sought to determine the molecular basis of the CbpA-FH binding interaction. Initial deletional analysis of the CbpA protein in strain D39 (capsular serotype 2) revealed that the N-terminal region of 89 amino acids in the mature CbpA protein is required for FH binding. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis showed that this region of CbpA is also necessary for FH deposition to the surface of the intact pneumococci. Moreover, recombinant proteins representing the 104 amino acids of the N-terminal CbpA alone was sufficient for high affinity binding to FH (KD < 1 nm). The FH binding activity was finally localized to a 12-amino acid motif in the N-terminal CbpA by peptide mapping. Further kinetic analysis suggested that additional amino acids downstream of the 12-amino acid motif provide necessary structural or conformational support for the CbpA-FH interaction. The 12-amino acid motif and its adjacent regions contain highly conserved residues among various CbpA alleles, suggesting that this region may mediate FH binding in multiple pneumococcal strains.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive bacterium, is a natural resident of the human upper airway. It is also an important human pathogen that causes a wide spectrum of bacterial infections including community-acquired pneumonia, otitis media, meningitis, bacteremia, and sinusitis (1Musher D.M. Mandell G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R.D. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. Churchill Livingstone, New York2000: 2128-2147Google Scholar). In healthy human adults, pneumococcal colonization can last weeks or months without apparent illness (2Austrian R. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1986; 18: S35-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Epidemiological studies suggest that 20–50% of healthy individuals may carry pneumococci at any given time (2Austrian R. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1986; 18: S35-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), demonstrating that S. pneumoniae is capable of withstanding host defense mechanisms. Both innate and adaptive immune responses are critical for limiting and clearing pneumococcal infections (1Musher D.M. Mandell G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R.D. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. Churchill Livingstone, New York2000: 2128-2147Google Scholar). Complement-mediated phagocytosis is a major innate immune mechanism against pneumococci (3Brown J.S. Hussell T. Gilliland S.M. Holden D.W. Paton J.C. Ehrenstein M.R. Walport M.J. Botto M. Proc. Natl.

The products of activated complement bound on pneumococci enhance phagocytosis by binding to complement receptors on professional phagocytes (5Gordon D.L. Johnson G.M. Hostetter M.K. J. Infect. Dis. 1986; 154: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Internalized pneumococci within phagocytes are killed in phagolysosomes (6Gordon S.B. Irving G.R. Lawson R.A. Lee M.E. Read R.C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2286-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Consistent with the key role of the complement system in bacterial clearance, recent studies have indicated that S. pneumoniae is able to evade complement activation. PspA (pneumococcal surface protein A) has been shown to inhibit complement activation in mouse models, probably by blocking recruitment of the alternative pathway (4Tu A.H. Fulgham R.L. McCrory M.A. Briles D.E. Szalai A.J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4720-4724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice infected with PspA mutants showed significantly attenuated levels of colonization and bacteremia (7McDaniel L.S. Yother J. Vijayakumar M. McGarry L. Guild W.R. Briles D.E. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Pneumolysin, a major pneumococcal toxin, is able to deplete complement by activating the classical complement pathway (8Alcantara R.B. Preheim L.C. Gentry-Nielsen M.J. Infect.

Genetic disruptions of CbpA expression in various pneumococcal strains led to significant loss of nasopharyngeal colonization, lung infection, and bacteremia in mice and rats (18Rosenow C. Ryan P.

These observations indicate CbpA as an important virulence factor. The precise mechanisms of CbpA action in pneumococcal survival in vivo and pathogenesis are not completely understood. There are considerable sequence variations among cbpA allelic variants from various S. pneumoniae strains. Based on sequence diversity, Iannelli et al. have divided 43 cbpA variants into 11 major types (20Iannelli F. Oggioni M.R. Pozzi G. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 284: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). CbpA of strain D39 (capsular serotype 2) is composed of an N-terminal signal sequence for protein secretion (38 amino acids) and a mature portion of the protein (663 amino acids) (18Rosenow C. Ryan P. Weiser J.N. Johnson S. Fontan P. Ortqvist A. Masure H.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of mature CbpA represents a choline-binding domain consisting of 10 tandem repeats of 20 amino acids. The N-terminal region is predicted to contain six α-helical structures, consisting of an N-terminal domain (96 amino acids), two direct repeats R1 and R2 (107 amino acids each), and a proline-rich linker (97 amino acids) (19Brooks-Walter A.

Binding interaction between CbpA and human pIgR has been shown to enhance pneumococcal adhesion to and invasion of cultured respiratory epithelial cells. Because the extracellular domains of pIgR are naturally present in mucosal secretions as free secretory component (SC) or as a component of SIgA, the R1/R2 region of CbpA also binds to SC and SIgA (16Hammerschmidt S.

Microbiol. 2000; 36: 726-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). FH is a 155-kDa plasma glycoprotein, which is composed of 20 short consensus repeats (SCRs) (28Rodriguez de Cordoba S. Esparza-Gordillo J. Goicoechea de Jorge E. Lopez-Trascasa M. Sanchez-Corral P. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Each of the SCRs shares high levels of sequence similarity. FH inhibits the alternative pathway of the complement system by preventing the binding of factor B to C3b, enhancing the decay of the C3-convertase (C3bBb) and acting as a cofactor for the cleavage of C3b by complement factor I (29Prodinger W.M. Wurzner R. Erdei A. Dierich M.P. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. 4th Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadephia1999: 967-995Google Scholar). Deposition of FH on host tissue and cellular surfaces prevents nonspecific damage and avoids the wasteful consumption of complement components (29Prodinger W.M. Wurzner R. Erdei A. Dierich M.P. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. 4th Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadephia1999: 967-995Google Scholar). Interestingly, many microbial pathogens have been shown to bind to FH as a common mechanism for evasion of complement-mediated host immunity (28Rodriguez de Cordoba S. Esparza-Gordillo J.

To gain further understanding of the biology of pneumococcal interactions with the host innate immune factors, we attempted to identify the FH binding motif on CbpA in this work. Our data have localized the FH binding activity within a 12-amino acid region in the N-terminal domain of CbpA from S. pneumoniae strain D39. Bacterial Strains and Chemical Reagents—All S. pneumoniae strains used in this work are listed in supplemental Table 2. Strains D39 (serotype 2) and TIGR 4 (serotype 4) were used as the parental strains from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). Pneumococci were routinely grown in Todd-Hewitt broth containing 0.5% yeast extract (THY) or on tryptic soy agar plates containing 3% (v/v) sheep blood. When necessary, kanamycin (200 μg/ml) or streptomycin (150 μg/ml) was included in the broth and agar media for selection purposes. Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for routine cloning; strains M15 and BL21 were used for expression of recombinant CbpA polypeptides. E. coli cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB agar plates. E. coli strains harboring the protein expression vectors were selected on LB medium containing ampicillin at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. All ingredients for bacterial culture media and other chemicals used in this work were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. DNA Electrophoresis and Southern Hybridization—DNA cloning and manipulations were performed according to standard methods (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). S. pneumoniae genomic DNA was prepared by the phenol/chloroform extraction method as described previously (43Pearce B.J. Yin Y.B. Masure H.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Restriction enzyme-digested DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. All restriction enzymes and DNA standards were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). DNA bands were visualized by staining agarose gels with ethidium bromide (2 μg/ml). For Southern hybridization, DNA was blotted to Hybond-N+ nylon membranes by the alkaline transfer method (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, agarose gels containing DNA fragments were soaked in 0.25 m HCl for 10 min to facilitate DNA transfer. The DNA fragments were transferred overnight to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) with 0.4 n NaOH. Following transfer, the membranes were neutralized with 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) for 5 min, rinsed in 2× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), and air-dried. DNA blots were reacted with digoxigenin (DIG)-dUTP-labeled probes according to the supplier's instructions. DNA probes were prepared using a PCR DIG probe synthesis kit as described by the supplier (Roche Applied Science). Prehybridization was performed for 1 h at 50°C in a DNA hybridization buffer (Roche Applied Science). Labeled PCR products (25–50 ng) were denatured by boiling for 5 min and added to the DNA hybridization buffer. After hybridization overnight at 50 °C, the membranes were sequentially washed (15 min/wash) with 1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 50 °C and 0.5× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Hybridization was detected with a DIG luminescent detection kit (Roche Applied Science) at room temperature as follows. The membranes were washed with the washing buffer (0.1 m maleic acid, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.3% Tween 20, pH 7.5) for 2 min, incubated with 1% blocking reagent in 0.1 m maleic acid and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.5) for 30 min, and reacted with a 1:5,000 dilution of the anti-DIG antibody for 1 h. After washing three times with the washing buffer (10 min/wash), the membranes were treated with the disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo-[3.3.1.13,7]decan}-4-yl)phenyl phosphate substrate, and hybridized DNA bands were visualized using a Futura 2000K automatic x-ray film developer (Fischer Industries, Geneva, IL). Sizes of DNA fragments were estimated based on DIG-labeled DNA molecular weight standards (Roche Applied Science). Construction of S. pneumoniae Mutants—The cbpA-null and truncated mutants of S. pneumoniae were generated in the streptomycin-resistant derivatives of strains D39 and TIGR4 by allelic replacement with the counter selectable Janus cassette as described previously (44Sung C.K. Li H. Claverys J.P. Morrison D.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5190-5196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Streptomycin-resistant pneumococcal strains were prepared by transformation with the recessive rpsL allele rpsL1 (or str1). The rpsL1 allele (45Mejean V. Salles C. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. Claverys J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), conferring streptomycin resistance in the absence of the wild type rpsL+ allele, was amplified by PCR from chromosomal DNA of strain CP1200 (46Morrison D.A. Trombe M.C. Hayden M.K. Waszak G.A. Chen J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 870-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (a gift from Donald A. Morrison) using primers Pr387/Pr388. The Janus cassette consists of a kanamycin-resistance gene and a dominant wild type rpsL+ allele encoding protein S12 of the small ribosomal subunit, a target for streptomycin (44Sung C.K. Li H. Claverys J.P. Morrison D.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5190-5196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct cbpA-null mutants in strains D39 and TIGR4, the upstream and downstream sequences flanking the cbpA coding region were used to target the precise deletion sites by double-crossover homologous recombination. The upstream (1,314-bp) and downstream (1,145-bp) cbpA flanking regions in strain D39 were separately amplified from genomic DNA preparations by PCR using primer pairs Pr252/Pr313 and Pr314/257, respectively (see supplemental Table 1 for primer sequences). Despite sequence diversity in the cbpA coding regions of various pneumococcal strains, the flanking sequences of the cbpA locus are highly conserved, including the 5′ (78-bp) and 3′ (229-bp) intergenic regions (20Iannelli F. Oggioni M.R. Pozzi G. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 284: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We thus amplified the cbpA flanking sequences of strains D39 and TIGR4 by using the same primer pairs. PCR amplifications were performed using conditions described previously (47Zhang J.-R. Hardham J.M. Barbour A.G. Norris S.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). To minimize the possibility of introducing sequence errors during PCR amplifications, a high fidelity DyNAzyme EXT DNA polymerase (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) was used for all PCR amplifications in this study. All of the primers were commercially synthesized by Invitrogen. The Janus cassette was amplified by PCR from chromosomal DNA of S. pneumoniae strain CP1296 using primers Pr311/Pr312. The primers were designed based on GenBank™ accession number AF411920. Strain CP1296 contains a chromosomal insertion of the Janus cassette (44Sung C.K. Li H. Claverys J.P. Morrison D.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5190-5196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Donald A. Morrison. The PCR products of the Janus cassette and the cbpA-flanking sequences were digested by appropriate restriction enzymes as determined by the nested restriction sites (AscI and FseI) at the 5′ end of the primers, purified from agarose gels using a DNA gel purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and ligated using a Quick Ligation kit (New England Biolabs). The ligation mixtures were used to transform streptomycin-resistant D39 (strain ST594) or streptomycin-resistant TIGR4 (strain ST630) by natural transformation as described previously (48Lau P.C. Sung C.K. Lee J.H. Morrison D.A. Cvitkovitch D.G. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2002; 49: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The transformants were selected for resistance to kanamycin (150 μg/ml) on blood agar plates. Kanamycin-resistant colonies were chosen to detect the loss of the entire cbpA coding region and the presence of the Janus cassette in the cbpA locus by PCR amplification, DNA sequencing, and Southern hybridization. In-frame deletions in the cbpA gene of strain D39 were generated by allelic exchange at the background of the cbpA-null mutant strain ST588 as described previously (44Sung C.K. Li H. Claverys J.P. Morrison D.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5190-5196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA segments flanking the deleted sequences of the cbpA gene were initially amplified by PCR using primers listed in supplemental Table 1 and illustrated in Fig. 1A. Primers were designed to create desirable in-frame deletions according to the complete genome sequence of strain R6, an unencapsulated derivative of strain D39 (accession number AE008564) (49Hoskins J. Alborn Jr., W.E. Arnold J. Blaszczak L.C. Burgett S. DeHoff B.S. Estrem S.T. Fritz L. Fu D.J. Fuller W. Geringer C. Gilmour R. Glass J.S. Khoja H. Kraft A.R. Lagace R.E. LeBlanc D.J. Lee L.N.

Zhao G. Zook C.A. Baltz R.H. Jaskunas S.R. Rosteck Jr., P.R. Skatrud P.L. Glass J.I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5709-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). PCR products of the initial PCR amplifications were subsequently joined together by overlap extension PCR (50Horton R.M. Z. C. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). The final PCR products were purified from agarose gels and directly used to transform strain ST588; transformants were selected for streptomycin-resistant clones (200 μg/ml). The resulting strains became resistant to streptomycin and sensitive to kanamycin due to the loss of the Janus cassette (44Sung C.K. Li H. Claverys J.P. Morrison D.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5190-5196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of the resultant cbpA alleles were further characterized by PCR amplification, Southern hybridization, and DNA sequencing using chromosomal DNA preparations of S. pneumoniae strains. The DNA sequence analysis was performed using the DNASTAR Lasergene version 6.1 (Madison, WI). Recombinant Protein Expression—The recombinant proteins CbpA1, CbpA2, and CbpA4 were expressed in the pQE30 vector and purified as 6-histidine (His)-tagged proteins in E. coli as described previously (24Zhang J.-R. Mostov K.E. Lamm M.E. Nanno M. Shimida S. Ohwaki M. Tuomanen E. Cell. 2000; 102: 827-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). A similar strategy was initially used to express CbpA7 as a His-tagged protein, but the construct with a correct sequence configuration did not yield detectable CbpA7 after appropriate induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside of the E. coli strain M15 containing the plasmid construct. CbpA7 was subsequently expressed as a fusion protein with the glutathione S-transferase (GST). Specifically, the 1089-bp DNA segment encoding the CbpA7 region was amplified from genomic DNA of strain D39 by PCR using primers Pr569/Pr604. The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the pGEX-2T expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) to produce a GST fusion protein (designated GST-CbpA7) in E. coli strain BL-21 (DE3) according to the supplier's instructions. The sequence of the insert was verified prior to use for protein expression. The full CbpA4 polypeptide and its smaller truncates (CbpA8-10) were also expressed as GST fusion constructs in the pGEX-2T vector in the same manner. The coding sequences of CbpA4, CbpA8, and Cbp9 were amplified by PCR using genomic DNA of strain D39 and primer pairs Pr105/Pr644, Pr105/Pr645, and Pr643/Pr645, respectively. The coding DNA sequence for CbpA10 was constructed to delete the FH binding motif by a two-step PCR amplification method. The upstream and downstream coding regions flanking the FH binding motif were first separately amplified from the genomic DNA of strain D39 with primer pairs Pr105/Pr641 and Pr642/Pr644, respectively. The two PCR products were subsequently joined together by overlap extension PCR using primers Pr105 and Pr644 (50Horton R.M. Z. C. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot and Antibodies—Western blot was performed essentially as described previously (25Lu L. Lamm M.E. Li H. Corthesy B. Zhang J.-R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48178-48187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates and purified proteins were boiled for 5 min in standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer in the presence of reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to electrophoresis in 10–20% Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels"

Huntington disease (HD) 3The abbreviations used are: HD, Huntington disease; htt, huntingtin; polyQ, polyglutamine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.3The abbreviations used are: HD, Huntington disease; htt, huntingtin; polyQ, polyglutamine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats on the N terminus of the IT15 gene that encodes the protein huntingtin (htt) (1Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research GroupCell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7053) Google Scholar). HD occurs in individuals whose htt gene has more than 37 CAGs, resulting in a mutant protein with an abnormally extended polyglutamine (polyQ) tract. Symptoms can manifest at any age and typically involve movement disorders, including chorea, along with psychiatric and cognitive dysfunction. The median age at onset is 40 years, with death generally following 15–20 years after appearance of symptoms (2Harper P.S. Huntington's Disease. W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia1991Google Scholar, 3Bates G. Harper P.S. Jones L. Huntington's Disease. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002Google Scholar). Although the neurodegeneration caused by the HD mutation is particularly marked in the striatum and cortex, htt is widely expressed in many different tissues and its functions are critical for life (4Nasir J.

Extensive genetic and transgenic data suggest that the HD mutation causes disease primarily by conferring a toxic gain-of-function on the mutant protein (Ref. 4Nasir J. Floresco S.B. O'Kusky J.R.

However, it is possible that loss-of-function and/or dominant negative effects may also contribute to pathology (reviewed in Refs. 11Rubinsztein D.C. Sci.

Proteolytic processing of htt is also likely to play an important role in HD pathogenesis. The toxicity of mutant htt may only be fully exposed after cleavage by proteases, including caspases, calpains, and a putative aspartic protease, to reveal a short, N-terminal polyQ-containing fragment of 100–150 residues (reviewed in Refs. 13Gafni J.

N-terminal cleavage products have been found in inclusions from HD patients (16Lunkes A. Lindenberg K.S. Ben-Haiem L. Weber C. Devys D. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Mandel J.L. Trottier Y. Mol.

However, it is still unclear which combination of proteolytic events is required for generation of the toxic fragments. There are nine different inherited neurodegenerative diseases caused by CAG/polyQ expansion in the target proteins. Although all show inclusions containing the expanded polyQs, the parts of the brain affected by the different polyQ-expanded proteins differ, resulting in different symptom constellations. Therefore, the host protein itself and its distinct interactions with other proteins probably play key roles in determining the disease pathology (19La Spada A.R. Taylor J.P. Neuron. 2003; 38: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent data suggest that wild-type htt may have a beneficial effect on the gain-of-function toxicity of the mutant protein (20Van Raamsdonk J.M. Pearson J. Rogers D.A. Bissada N.

Genet. 2001; 38: 450-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to determine the normal functions of htt in order to fully understand the pathogenesis of HD. Many htt-interacting proteins have been reported, and wild-type htt has been proposed to have roles in a wide range of activities, including neurotransmission, axonal transport, and neuronal positioning (22Harjes P. Wanker E.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 23Goehler H. Lalowski M. Stelzl U. Waelter S. Stroedicke M. Worm U. Droege A.

However, sequence analysis revealed that htt contains multiple HEAT repeat sequences (24Takano H. Gusella J.F. BMC Neurosci. 2002; 3: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A HEAT (Htt, Elongation factor 3, the PR65/A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, and the lipid kinase TOR) repeat is a degenerate ∼50-amino acid motif consisting of two anti-parallel α-helices forming a helical hairpin (see Fig. 5). HEAT repeat proteins generally mediate important protein-protein interactions involved in cytoplasmic and nuclear transport, microtubule dynamics, and chromosome segregation (25Neuwald A.F. Hirano T. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To date, there are four HEAT repeat proteins with known three-dimensional structures: importin-β, karyopherin-β2, the PR65/A subunit of PP2A, and Cand1 (26Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W.

BMC Neurosci. 2002; 3: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) predicted that vertebrate htt contains 28–36 HEAT repeats that span the entire protein. To understand the normal functions of wild-type htt, it is useful to know its structural features. All in vitro biochemical work on htt has been limited to polyQ-containing N-terminal fragments, such as exon 1. The aim of this study is to express and purify full-length wild-type human htt to allow characterization of its biochemical, biophysical, and structural properties and to provide a tool for addressing the molecular basis of its manifold interactions. Here we report the expression and purification of recombinant full-length human htt to over 95% homogeneity. Preliminary characterization by circular dichroism, dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy, and limited proteolysis supports a model of htt predominantly composed of HEAT repeats that stack into a rod-like superhelical structure. Materials—pFastBacHTb vector, DH10Bac competent cells, and the insect cell lines (Sf9 and Hi-Five) were all purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-htt monoclonal antibodies MAB2166, 2168, and 2170 were purchased from Chemicon International. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody and its antibody gel were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was purchased from DAKO A/S. Mark12 from Invitrogen was used for SDS-PAGE, and rainbow molecular weight marker from Amersham Biosciences was used for Western blot. HMW Native Marker kit was used for native-PAGE (Amersham Biosciences). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Full-length Human htt—Full-length human htt cDNA (IT15) with N-terminal His6 and 3xFLAG tags was subcloned from pTre2Hyg:3xFLAG:htt17QFL construct (32Sugars K.L. Brown R. Cook L.J. Swartz J. Rubinsztein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4988-4999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) into Bac-to-Bac vector pFastBacHTb between the BamHI and NotI sites. The bacmid was generated according to Invitrogen's Bac-to-Bac manual, and the transfection of Sf9 cells was carried out using FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics Ltd.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The transfection supernatant containing the recombinant virus was amplified over three rounds and then used to infect Hi-Five cells for protein production. Cells were harvested 72 h after infection, and expression of full-length htt was initially verified by immunoblotting. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, EDTA-free; Roche Diagnostics). Cells were broken by sonication, and cell debris was spun down by centrifugation. The supernatant was collected and passed through a 5-ml Hi-Trap metal-chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) precharged with Ni2SO4. After washing with buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole, bound proteins were eluted using a 5–200-mm imidazole gradient. Fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and those containing full-length htt were pooled and concentrated using a 30-kDa cut-off spin concentrator (Viva Science). The semipurified htt was then passed through a Superose 6 16/60 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated in buffer A. Fractions containing htt were pooled and further purified using the ANTI-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, htt (in buffer A) was incubated with the affinity gel at 4 °C overnight, followed by two washes with 5 resin-volumes of buffer A. The major contaminant, identified as tubulin by N-terminal sequencing, did not bind to the resin (data not shown). The protein that bound to the resin was eluted with 3xFLAG peptide (0.3 mg/ml in buffer A). htt purity was judged by SDS-PAGE and concentration determined using the Bradford assay. htt expression levels and purification yields were estimated from Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE, using bovine serum albumin as the standard. PAGE and Western Blots—SDS- and native-PAGE were carried out using 3–8% Tris acetate gels from Invitrogen, following the manufacturer's instructions. Western blotting was performed using a Bio-Rad semidry transfer system and developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Coomassie staining of native and SDS gels was conducted using SimplyBlue Safestain (Invitrogen), which has a reported sensitivity of 7 ng of bovine serum albumin. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Purified full-length human htt (0.2 mg/ml) was dialyzed into 30 mm Tris, SO4 pH 7.4, overnight before CD analysis. CD spectra were measured at 20 °C on a JASCO 810 spectropolarimeter using a 0.5-mm cuvette, from 180 to 260 nm, and 20 scans were averaged. The spectra were analyzed using the CD Spectra Deconvolution program (CDNN, version 2.1) (33Bohm G. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 59: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The experiment was repeated twice with material judged by SDS-PAGE to be 70 and 90% un-nicked, and identical traces were obtained. Negative Stain Electron Microscopy—A 4-μl droplet of each isolated fraction of htt from the Superose 6 column was placed on carbon-coated copper 400-mesh grids (Agar Scientific). The solution was blotted away and washed once with 4 μl of milliQ-filtered water and blotted. The grid was then stained using 4 μl of 2% uranyl acetate, blotted, and allowed to air dry. The grid was examined using a Hitachi 7100 transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV, and images were taken using a Gatan Ultrascan 1000 CCD camera at magnifications of ×15,000–50,000. Images were converted to tif or jpg format using Digital micrograph software. Immunogold Electron Microscopy—5 μl of htt from fraction 4, which eluted at 77 ml off the Superose 6 column, was placed on a carbon-coated grid and incubated for 2 min. The grid was then placed sample side down onto a droplet of milk (1% w/v in PBS) for 10 min and then lifted off and blotted. The grid was placed onto a droplet of primary antibody (MAB2166, MAB2168, or MAB2170), diluted 1/1000 in 1% w/v milk in PBS, covered, and incubated for 60 min. The grid was washed ten times with filtered PBS and blotted and then incubated for 60 min on a droplet of secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse 10 nm or 5 nm conjugated-gold; Sigma) diluted 1/20 in PBS. Finally, the grid was washed three times for 5 min with PBS and three times for 5 min in water and blotted. The grid was then stained as described above with 2% uranyl acetate. Controls were done using the same protocol with water instead of protein solution. Dynamic Light Scattering—Dynamic light scattering was carried out at 20 °C on a DynaPro-801 molecular sizing instrument from Protein Solutions. htt at 0.4 mg/ml was passed through a 0.1-μm filter before loading into a 45-μl cuvette. 26 counts were taken and averaged for measuring the dynamic radius and the polydispersion. Limited Trypsin Digestion—Purified htt was treated with 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, and 0.24% trypsin (by weight) at room temperature for 40 min. The reactions were stopped by adding a 10-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and samples were run on SDS- and native-PAGE. The experiment shown in Fig. 4 was conducted on material judged to be 40% nicked during purification, but similar results were obtained from starting material judged to be only 10% nicked (data not shown). Molecular Modeling—A model of a HEAT repeat protein of 2880 residues was generated using the coordinates of importin-β (A chain from 1UKL) (34Lee S.J. Sekimoto T. Yamashita E. Nagoshi E. Nakagawa A. Imamoto N. Yoshimura M. Sakai H. Chong K.T. Tsukihara T. Yoneda Y. Science. 2003; 302: 1571-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A continuous superhelix composed of four A chains was created by superimposing a C-terminal helix starting at residue 855 on the N-terminal helix of another monomer starting at residue 187. Overlapping residues were removed, and the resulting model was energy minimized using CNS (35Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

A ribbon diagram was generated using programs Molscript (36Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15: 132-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar) and Raster3D (37Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar), and the surface representation was created using the program Spock. Expression and Purification of Full-length htt—The first step in determining the structural and functional properties of htt is to obtain milligram quantities of pure full-length protein. Purification of naturally expressed htt from human cells could never yield enough protein of sufficient quality, making it necessary to develop a recombinant system. We initially attempted expression in bacteria, but expression levels were very low and htt could only be detected in whole cell extracts. This was presumably due to the size of htt and the absence in Escherichia coli of the necessary protein folding machinery. We chose insect cells for expression of human htt because they have an htt homologue (38Li Z. Karlovich C.A. Fish M.P. Scott M.P. Myers R.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1807-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and are a well established eukaryotic expression system for cytosolic proteins (39Kost T.A. Condreay J.P. Jarvis D.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Full-length human htt cDNA was cloned into pFastbacHTb vector with an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a 3xFLAG tag (Fig. 1A). The vector was transformed into DH10Bac cells to generate the bacmid that was used to transfect the insect cells. The full-length htt band was readily detected on a Coomassie-stained SDS gel from the transfected total cell lysate (Fig. 1B), and its identity was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-htt monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 1C, MAB2166, MAB2168, and MAB2170). After nickel affinity chromatography, full-length htt was ∼70% pure (Fig. 1D, lane 1). Further purification on a Superose 6 gel filtration column and anti-FLAG tag resin generated ∼95% pure htt (Fig. 1D, lane 2). The majority of the htt eluted from the Superose 6 column in high molecular mass complexes of either homo- or hetero-oligomers (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the last peak to elute corresponded to an approximate molecular mass of 500 kDa, whereas full-length htt is 347 kDa, suggestive of a non-globular protein fold. This peak was shown by native PAGE to be composed primarily of monomeric htt that again ran between the molecular mass markers corresponding to 440 and 669kDa and a small amount of dimer (Fig. 2B). The native gel was blotted with the full complement of anti-htt antibodies MAB2166, MAB2168, and MAB2170 to confirm the product was full-length htt (only MAB2166 shown in Fig. 2C). It is evident from the Western blot that fraction 4 is predominantly monomeric, with only a small fraction of dimer and no higher ordered species. Although yields varied somewhat, we typically obtained 0.5 mg of pure htt/liter of cell culture. This figure, 0.5 mg/liter, represents only ∼10% of the total expressed htt due to the association of at least half of the protein with the insoluble cell components and the aggregation of a large fraction of the soluble htt (as seen in A). Despite the low yields, we were successful in expressing and purifying sufficient quantities of full-length monomeric htt to undertake preliminary biophysical studies. Varying degrees of proteolytic nicking were observed in preps of htt. We observed that the extent of nicking ranged from 5 to 40% depending on whether EDTA was present in the cell lysis buffer. Implications of the proteolytic nicking of purified htt are dealt with in detail in the sections below.FIGURE 2Fractionation of semipurified htt on a gel filtration column. A, elution profile of nickel column-purified htt from a Superose 6 column. The column was calibrated with the high molecular mass calibration kit from Amersham Bioscience, and the elution positions of the standards are indicated. Four fractions were chosen for further analysis (numbers 1–4), and the position determined to correspond to monomeric htt is indicated. B, a Coomassie-stained non-denaturing native gel of the same fractions shows that early fractions contain large aggregates and later fractions contain monomeric htt and a small amount of dimer. C, the same native gel as in panel C, blotted with anti-htt antibody MAB2166 (similar results were obtained with MAB2168 and 2170). D, negative-stained electron microscopy pictures, with sections 1–4 corresponding to the fractions. Large aggregates are seen in fractions 1 and 2, and small particles (probably corresponding to monomeric htt) are seen in fraction 4. E, the same sample as in panel E, section 4, but with immunogold labeling (black) using anti-htt antibody MAB2166. This confirms that the distinct particles are htt.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Electron Microscopy Shows Monomeric htt Particles—Fractions isolated from the Superose 6 purification step were examined by negative stain electron microscopy (Fig. 2D) to confirm the presence of aggregates in the early peaks and to see whether any regular structure could be observed. Fraction 1 (void from Superose 6) showed large deposits of aggregated protein, whereas fractions 2 and 3 showed a mixture of nonspecific protein deposits with increasing numbers of small individual particles. The small particles were particularly noticeable in fraction 4. To determine whether the distinct particles were composed of htt, a sample of fraction 4 was labeled using monoclonal antibodies MAB2166, MAB2168, or MAB2170 and visualized using immunogold (Fig. 2E). All three antibodies specifically labeled the particles (only MAB2166 is shown in the figure), suggesting that the small particles observed in the negative stain electron microscopy correspond to monomeric full-length htt. htt Is an Elongated Molecule with High Helical Content—To see whether the purified material was homogeneous and whether htt was indeed elongated, we carried out a dynamic light-scattering experiment. htt concentrated to 0.4 mg/ml gave a single peak, which when analyzed as monomodal yielded a hydrodynamic radius of 13.4 nm with a polydispersion of 31.6%. Polydispersity above 20% normally suggests the presence of some higher ordered species; as we knew our solution contained a small amount of dimer (by native-PAGE, Fig. 2, B and C), this was not unexpected. A bimodal analysis yielded hydrodynamic radii of 9.5 and 21.0 nm, likely corresponding to monomeric and dimeric htt. Using a standard curve containing transferrin, enolase, alcohol dehydrogenase, aldolase, and apoferritin, we calculated a molecular mass of 522 kDa for a hydrodynamic radius of 9.5 nm, similar to what we obtain for monomeric htt by size-exclusion chromatography and native-PAGE. Thus, the hydrodynamic radius observed by dynamic light scattering, along with the migration behavior on size exclusion chromatography and native-PAGE, suggests an elongated structure for htt. The crystal structures of four other HEAT repeat proteins reveal a high helical content (>50%) (30Perry J. Kleckner N. Cell. 2003; 112: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because it is predicted that HEAT repeats span the entire htt gene (24Takano H. Gusella J.F. BMC Neurosci. 2002; 3: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), it is expected that human htt would have a similar high helical content with multiple solvent-exposed turns and coils connecting the helices. Indeed, the CD spectrum showed that purified recombinant full-length htt was predominantly composed of α-helical secondary structure (Fig. 3A). Deconvolution of the CD spectrum gave rise to 58.1% α-helix, 5.4% β-strand, and 27.7% turns and coils. This is in good agreement with Neural Network (40Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar) secondary structure predictions (51.9% α-helix, 8.2% β-strand, and 39.8% coils). Thermal denaturation of recombinant htt was carried out by monitoring change to CD signal at 222 nm with increasing temperature. We observed a single broad transition with a midpoint at ∼52 °C (Fig. 3B), indicating that full-length htt does not unfold in the cooperative manner associated with globular proteins. To determine whether the apparent non-cooperativity was due to the proteolytic nicking of htt, we repeated the scans and melts with 70 and 90% intact material and observed no difference. Similar broad melting profiles have been observed for other helical repeat proteins that form non-globular structures (41Beddoe T. Bushell S.R. Perugini M.A. Lithgow T. Mulhern T.D. Bottomley S.P. Rossjohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46448-46454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas others appear more cooperative in nature (42Zweifel M.E. Barrick D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14357-14367Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is possible that the cooperativity of the melting transitions of helical repeat proteins is related to the size of the repeat regions. The most cooperative transition is observed for the smallest protein, the repeat portion of the Notch receptor, which contains ∼200 amino acids, whereas a broad non-cooperative transition is observed for the repeat segment of TOM70, which is ∼550 amino acids in size. htt contains over 3,000 amino acids and may have several segments that unfold semi-independently. htt Is Susceptible to Proteolysis but Remains Associated when Cleaved at Multiple Sites—During purification we noticed that htt was particularly prone to proteolysis even in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture. In some preparations, a 220-kDa degradation product was the major band observed in the nickel column eluate, and some smaller fragments were still associated with full-length htt after gel filtration (Fig. 4A, lane 1). The degree of proteolysis during htt purification was found to depend on whether EDTA was present in the cell lysis buffer. Thus, the apparent purity of htt in Fig. 4A differs from that in Fig. 1D (where EDTA was present). Because the construct has a 3xFLAG tag at the N terminus, the monomeric htt fractions from the Superose 6 column were further purified on an ANTI-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Fig. 4A). However, after FLAG tag purification, all of the ∼220 kDa and most of the smaller bands still appeared in the eluate. The apparent association of htt fragments was not due to the presence of artifactual disulfide bonds, because we obtained similar results in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol (e.g. Fig. 4D). Using the three anti-htt monoclonal antibodies and the anti-FLAG an"

Bc-SMase is a homologue of mammalian neutral SMase (nSMase) and mimics the actions of the endogenous mammalian nSMase in causing differentiation, development, aging, and apoptosis. Thus Bc-SMase may be a good model for the poorly characterized mammalian nSMase. The metal ion activation of sphingomyelinase activity of Bc-SMase was in the order Co2+ ≥ Mn2+ ≥ Mg2+ » Ca2+ ≥ Sr2+. The first crystal structures of Bc-SMase bound to Co2+, Mg2+, or Ca2+ were determined. The water-bridged double divalent metal ions at the center of the cleft in both the Co2+- and Mg2+-bound forms were concluded to be the catalytic architecture required for sphingomyelinase activity. In contrast, the architecture of Ca2+ binding at the site showed only one binding site. A further single metal-binding site exists at one side edge of the cleft. Based on the highly conserved nature of the residues of the binding sites, the crystal structure of Bc-SMase with bound Mg2+ or Co2+ may provide a common structural framework applicable to phosphohydrolases belonging to the DNase I-like folding superfamily. In addition, the structural features and site-directed mutagenesis suggest that the specific β-hairpin with the aromatic amino acid residues participates in binding to the membrane-bound sphingomyelin substrate.

EC 3.1.4.12) from Bacillus cereus (Bc-SMase) exhibits both phospholipase C activity, hydrolyzing sphingomyelin (SM) to phosphocholine and ceramide, and hemolytic activity. Both Bc-SMase activities occur in a divalent metal ion-dependent manner (1Ikezawa H. Mori M. Ohyabu T. Taguchi R. Biochim. Biophys.

Tsukamoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of the sphingomyelin hydrolytic activity remains to be elucidated in atomic detail, as there are no crystal structures of SMase in complex with the essential divalent metal ions. The sphingomyelin hydrolytic activity of Bc-SMase is believed to proceed in the manner of acid base catalysis, in which His-296 is proposed to generate an activated water and the essential Mg2+ ion at Glu-53 is suggested to stabilize a negatively charged transition state. The proposed catalytic mechanism of Bc-SMase is similar to that of bovine DNase I. In fact, Bc-SMase and bovine DNase I are homologous proteins and share a common architecture of conserved putative catalytic amino acid residues (7Openshaw A.E.A. Race P.R. Monzó H.J. Vázquez-Boland J.-A. Banfield M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35011-35017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the proposed catalytic mechanism does not fully explain the role of the essential divalent metal ion, i.e. the divalent metal ion type dependence for hydrolytic catalysis, because of the lack of the bound essential metal ions in all the currently available structures. Bc-SMase and neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) in mammalian cells share similar metal ion dependence and considerable amino acid sequence identity (20%), including conserved residues involved in divalent metal ion binding, and are thus believed to have a similar hydrolytic mechanism. SMases in mammalian cells are classified into the following three groups according to the optimum pH of the SM hydrolytic activity: neutral SMase, acid SMase, and alkaline SMase (8Goñi M.F. Alonso A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanism of the sphingomyelin hydrolysis activity of Bc-SMase may provide insight into sphingolipid metabolism in mammalian cells (9Hofmann K. Tomiuk S. Wolff G. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl.

The only available structure of SMase is from the bacterium, Listeria ivanovii, reported recently (7Openshaw A.E.A. Race P.R. Monzó H.J. Vázquez-Boland J.-A. Banfield M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35011-35017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The bacterial SMase was confirmed to be a member of the DNase I-like folding superfamily (12Weston S.A. Lahm A. Suck D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1237-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 13Oefner C. Suck D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 605-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 14Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5609) Google Scholar), and the putative active site amino acid residues of the bacterial SMase were found to be geometrically identical to the corresponding amino acid residues of enzymes in the DNase I-like folding superfamily. The bacterial SMase differs, however, in having a unique hydrophobic β-hairpin structure. The L. ivanovii SMase structure allowed elucidation of a number of key features of the catalytic mechanism of bacterial SMases. However, structural information on the role of the essential divalent metal ions in catalysis is still lacking, and the hydrolytic molecular mechanism remains elusive. Bacterial SMases have been reported to bind to the cell surface when catalyzing hemolysis. The crystal structure of SMase from L. ivanovii indicated that interaction with the membrane would occur at the unique hydrophobic β-hairpin region (7Openshaw A.E.A. Race P.R. Monzó H.J. Vázquez-Boland J.-A. Banfield M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35011-35017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This was inferred based on two indirect observations. First, there are two solvent-exposed aromatic amino acid residues at the top of the β-hairpin. Second, the corresponding region of structurally similar enzymes is a short loop. The role of the β-hairpin remains to be confirmed experimentally. In this study we propose that the water-bridged double divalent metal ions are essential in the hydrolytic activity of Bc-SMase based on the high resolution crystal structures of Bc-SMase with the metal ions Co2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+, respectively. It is the divalent metal ion bound to His-296 that activates the water molecule as the nucleophile in sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Simplified assays using very low concentrations of substrate indicated a divalent metal ion-type dependence for the hydrolytic activity of Bc-SMase compatible with the divalent metal ion architecture. In addition, we confirmed experimentally that the β-hairpin, the unique feature of hemolytic SMases, participates in not only the binding of Bc-SMase to the cell membrane and SM liposomes but the hydrolytic activity of Bc-SMase. Expression and Purification—Bc-SMase was overexpressed in Bacillus subtilis ISW1214 transformed with the plasmid vector, pHY300PLK, carrying cDNA of Bc-SMase cloned from B. cereus IAM 1029. The Bc-SMase was secreted into the culture medium. The 80% (w/v) ammonium sulfate fraction of the harvested culture medium was sequentially purified through a Cu2+ column and a DEAE-Sepharose column. The purity of samples was verified using SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The Bc-SMase was observed as a single band at 35 kDa. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (BD Biosciences) was used with the primers W284A, 5′-TGGACTGTTACATCAGCGTTCCAAAAATAT-3′, and F285A, 5′-ACTGTTACATCATGGGCGCAAAAATATACG-3′, to prepare the modified plasmids. The genetic sequence of Bc-SMase in each plasmid was confirmed with an ABI 310 PRISM™ genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Preparation of Liposomes—Multilamellar liposomes composed of phospholipid and cholesterol were prepared according to previous reports (15Tomita T. Watanabe M. Yasuda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13391-13397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tomita T. Watanabe M. Yasuda T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1104: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A mixture of phospholipid (0.5 μmol) and chloroform was evaporated under reduced pressure to form a lipid film on the wall of a conical bottomed flask. After drying under reduced pressure for 1 h, the lipid film was hydrated by vortexing at 45–50 °C or above the phase transition temperature of the SM used, in 100 μl of carboxyl fluorescein and 0.9% (w/v) NaCl. The liposome suspensions were centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove the non-encapsulated marker and washed three times by centrifugation in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.9% (w/v) NaCl (Tris-buffered saline). The resulting liposomes were suspended in 200 μl of Tris-buffered saline. SMase Activity Assay—The hemolytic activity of the enzyme was determined by the amount of hemoglobin released from sheep erythrocytes using a method described previously (17Ochi S. Oda M. Matsuda H. Ikari S. Sakurai J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12181-12189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture containing the enzyme at various concentrations, 3% (w/v) sheep erythrocytes, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then centrifuged at 500 × g for 3 min in order to prepare the test aliquot. Lysis was determined spectrophotometrically at A550 nm. The SM liposome disruption activity was determined by the amount of carboxyl fluorescein in the test aliquot. The SM liposome solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.9% (w/v) NaCl was incubated with Bc-SMase for 30 min at 37 °C. The wavelengths for excitation and measurement were 490 and 530 nm, respectively. All hydrolytic activities of the enzymes were measured using the 14C-labeled SM, [N-methyl-14C]SM (Amersham Biosciences), as substrate (18Jaffrezou J.P. Levade T. Bettaieb A. Andrieu N. Bezombes C. Maestre N. Vermeersch S. Rousse A. Laurent G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The concentration of the labeled SM was well below the critical micelle concentration of SM. The enzyme was dialyzed against a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA to remove the contaminant metal ions. The reaction mixture containing the dialyzed enzyme (50 ng/ml) and an additional divalent metal ion (5 mm) was preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and then the reaction mixture was incubated with 1.25 μm [N-methyl-14C] SM at 37 °C for various periods. The reaction was terminated by the addition of the stop solution (CHCl3/MeOH, 2:1), and the radioactivity of the labeled product in the chloroform phase was measured by the liquid scintillation counter LSC-6100 (Aloka). Membrane Binding Assay of Bc-SMase—The membrane binding assay was performed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis using a Biacore3000 system and the associated analysis software package (Biacore). The enzyme solutions at concentrations of 10, 5, and 0 μgof enzyme/ml were applied to the L1 sensor chips coated with or without SM liposome at a flow rate of 10 μl/min in a running buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mm CaCl2, and 0.9% (w/v) NaCl) at 25 °C. Dissociation was monitored for 100 s at least in a constant flow of running buffer without enzyme. The binding assay using the 125I-labeled enzyme was performed according to Bolton and Hunter (19Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). SM liposomes in a buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2) were incubated with 10 ng/ml wild-type or mutant enzymes at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the SM liposomes were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The treated liposomes were washed in buffer and then treated with 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was then dissolved in buffer supplemented with 2% (w/v) SDS, boiled for 3 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography using a FLA2000 (Fuji Film). Crystallization—Crystals of Bc-SMase were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 10 °C. The crystallization drop for the calcium acetate-bound form was prepared by mixing equal volumes of protein solution (10 mg/ml Bc-SMase in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0)) and reservoir solution (18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m Ca(O-COCH3)2, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5)). For the calcium and cobalt chloride-bound crystals, calcium acetate was replaced with calcium chloride or cobalt chloride at a concentration of 0.2 m. In both cases the sodium cacodylate buffer was replaced with 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5). The crystals grew to maximum dimensions of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm within a few weeks. The crystals of the magnesium-bound form were obtained in 16% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5). The crystals of the calcium acetate-bound form were soaked for 12 h in the reservoir solution containing 5 mm samarium acetate to prepare the heavy metal derivative crystals. X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determination—The diffraction images of the calcium acetate-bound form and the samarium-derivative crystals were collected at 100 K by a DIP2030 detector/MXC-18 (MacScience) using the monochromatized CuKα x-ray beam. The crystals were dipped in paratone-N (Hampton Research) to prevent ice formation at cryogenic temperatures. All diffraction images were processed by MOSFLM (20Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) and SCALA (20Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) to prepare diffraction intensity data sets. The intensity data sets reduced using the apparent higher symmetry C2, a = 77.7 Ä, b = 65.4 Ä, c = 59.9 Ä, β = 101.2°, were prepared to obtain initial phases by the single isomorphous replacement method taking account of the anomalous effect, whereas the true space group of the crystals was P1. The diffraction images of the crystal of the calcium chloride form up to 1.4 Ä resolution were measured using RAXIS-V (RIGAKU) detector at BL45XU, SPring-8, and processed by MOSFLM (20Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr.

The diffraction images of the cobalt chloride form up to 1.77 Ä resolution were collected using RAXIS-VII on a FR-E x-ray generator (Rigaku) and processed by HKL2000 (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar) in the true space group P1 (a = 65.1 Ä, b = 72.7 Ä, c = 78.1 Ä, α = 112.0°, β = 90.1°, γ = 116.6°). The diffraction images of the crystal of the magnesium-bound form to 1.80 Ä resolution were collected using a Jupiter (Rigaku) detector at BL26B1, SPring-8, and processed by MOSFLM (20Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr.

The initial phases were calculated by the program SOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) using the data sets of the calcium acetate and the samarium acetate-derivative crystals at 2.8 Ä resolution in the apparent space group C2. Phase extension to 2.5 Ä with density modification, manual model building, and refinement calculations were performed using the programs RESOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The partially refined model was used as a search model for molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (20Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) in the true space group P1.

The crystal structures of the cobalt- and magnesium-bound forms were also determined by molecular replacement. The crystallographic statistics of the collected data and the refined models are summarized in Table 1. PyMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC) and QUANTA (Accelrys) were used to prepare the structure figures.TABLE 1Statistics of diffraction data and refinementData set for phasingaThe diffraction data sets for the initial phasing were prepared using the apparent higher crystallographic symmetry C2.

Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5513) Google Scholar). Modeling the Substrate-binding Region—Due to the structural and catalytic similarities between Bc-SMase and DNase I, the sphingomyelin-binding model of the cobalt-bound Bc-SMase was constructed using QUANTA (Accelrys) and O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) based on the crystal structure of DNase I complexed with DNA (Protein Data Bank code 1DNK) (12Weston S.A. Lahm A. Suck D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1237-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The phosphate group of sphingomyelin was placed at the scissile phosphoester of DNA in the crystal structure of the DNase I + DNA complex superimposed on Bc-SMase. The phosphate group of the model was in the vicinity of the phosphate group at the active site of the L. ivanovii SMase superimposed on Bc-SMase (7Openshaw A.E.A. Race P.R. Monzó H.J. Vázquez-Boland J.-A. Banfield M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35011-35017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), with a distance of about 1.8 Ä between the two phosphorus atoms. The position of the phosphate moiety from the surface of Bc-SMase was slightly further than that of L. ivanovii. This is likely to be because the phosphate moiety of the model binds to the active site via the essential divalent cations in contrast to the direct binding of the phosphate groups observed in the L. ivanovii crystal structure lacking the essential divalent cations. The conformation of the sphingomyelin molecule from the phosphocholine to the C-3 carbon mimics the conformation of the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA chain containing the scissile phosphoester bond. Both aliphatic chains lie in the branched trench of Bc-SMase. Coordinates—The coordinates and the structure factors of the calcium-bound, the cobalt-bound, and the magnesium-bound forms have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 2DDR, 2DDS, and 2DDT, respectively. Overall Structure—In this study, the crystal structures of Bc-SMase complexed to the functional metal ions Mg2+, Co2+, or Ca2+ were determined at 1.8, 1.8, and 1.4 Ä resolution, respectively. The overall structure of Bc-SMase consisted of a β-sandwich architecture made up of α/β motifs (Fig. 1A) and is basically the same independent of the bound metal ion. There are three distinct metal ion-binding sites in a long horizontal cleft across the Bc-SMase molecule (Fig. 1B). A double Co2+ site was identified in the central cleft as the active site located next to the C-terminal end of β-strand 2 (site A) and the loop from Asn-291 to Val-298 (site B). The third Co2+-binding site is located in the edge of the cleft at the N-terminal end of α-helix 2 (Fig. 1C). The number of the bound metal ions in the central site is dependent on the divalent metal ion. Two Co2+ ions were bound to the active site compared with only one Ca2+ ion. In contrast, in every case only one metal ion was bound to the edge site (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2The edge metal-binding site. The Mg2+-bound form (A), the Co2+-bound form (B), and the Ca2+-bound form (C) bind a divalent metal ion each with octahedral geometry. The |Fo| – |Fc| omit electron density map of the Mg2+-bound form is contoured at 4.5σ. The anomalous difference peaks of the Co2+- and the Ca2+-bound forms were contoured at 5σ and 3σ, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Central Metal-binding Site as the Catalytic Site—We investigated the relationship between Bc-SMase hydrolytic activity and the essential divalent metal ions, Co2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Sr2+. The hydrolytic activity of Bc-SMase was measured using [N-methyl-14C]SM as substrate maintained well below the critical micelle concentration to allow calculation of simple kinetics without involvement of the micelle. The values of Vmax (μmol min–1mg protein–1):Km (μm) for Co2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Sr2+ were 14.2:14.2, 11.5:14.9, 10.8:16.1, 1.0:19.1 and 0.2:18.0, respectively (Fig. 3). These results show Bc-SMase with bound Co2+, Mn2+, or Mg2+ has high catalytic activity, but Bc-SMase with bound Ca2+ or Sr2+ exhibits much lower catalytic activity under the experimental conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1976486696,"The Escherichia coli proteins DksA, GreA, and GreB are all structural homologs that bind the secondary channel of RNA polymerase (RNAP) but are thought to act at different levels of transcription. DksA, with its co-factor ppGpp, inhibits rrnB P1 transcription initiation, whereas GreA and GreB activate RNAP to cleave back-tracked RNA during elongational pausing. Here, in vivo and in vitro evidence reveals antagonistic regulation of rrnB P1 transcription initiation by Gre factors (particularly GreA) and DksA; GreA activates and DksA inhibits. DksA inhibition is epistatic to GreA activation. Both modes of regulation are ppGpp-independent in vivo but DksA inhibition requires ppGpp in vitro. Kinetic experiments and studies of rrnB P1-RNA polymerase complexes suggest that GreA mediates conformational changes at an initiation step in the absence of NTP substrates, even before DksA acts. GreA effects on rrnB P1 open complex conformation reveal a new feature of GreA distinct from its general function in elongation. Our findings support the idea that a balance of the interactions between the three secondary channel-binding proteins and RNAP can provide a new mode for regulating transcription.

Yeast RNA polymerase II transcription factor TFIIS, although structurally distinct from GreA and GreB (10Kettenberger H. Armache K.-J. Cramer P. Cell. 2003; 114: 347-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), also positions a pair of conserved acidic amino acid residues near the catalytic center. In all cases, these acidic residues activate an intrinsic RNA phosphodiesterase activity of RNAP paused during elongation, leading to cleavage of nascent RNA, whose 3′ end has threaded backwards relative to the catalytic center; this cleavage creates a 3′-hydroxyl near the catalytic center and restores the possibility of polymerization (11Komissarova N.

The length of RNA cleavage products differs and GreA, but not GreB, needs to bind before arrest to activate RNA cleavage (14Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 15Laptenko O. Lee J. Lomakin I. Borukhov S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6322-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Functions proposed for Gre factors include: facilitating promoter escape by suppressing abortive transcription; suppressing elongational pausing or arrest; and enhancing proofreading (Ref. 16Hsu L.M.

Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1315-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although blocking the passage of NTP substrates by binding of Gre factors has not been shown, channel binding by the structurally unique Microcin J25 antibacterial peptide is thought to inhibit transcription elongation directly by obstructing NTP entry (2Mukhopadhyay J.

Transcription initiation can also be regulated through the secondary channel by DksA and (p)ppGpp, 3′-pyrophosphorylated derivatives of GDP (GTP). First, (p)ppGpp, a nearly ubiquitous nucleotide regulator of transcription in eubacteria and in plants, can be localized by co-crystallization with RNAP near the catalytic center (18Artsimovitch I. Patlan V. Sekine S. Vassylyeva M.N. Hosaka T. Ochi K. Yokoyama S. Vassylyev D. Cell. 2004; 117: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Second, DksA, despite a divergent amino acid sequence, is a structural homolog of GreA and GreB. This allows similar modeling in the secondary channel and a proposal of nearly appropriate placement of the key pair of conserved acidic residues (19Perederina A. Svetlov V. Vassylyeva M.N. Tahirov T.H. Yokoyama S. Artsimovitch I. Vassylyev D.G. Cell. 2004; 118: 297-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Third, DksA and ppGpp can function both in vitro and in vivo as synergistic co-factors for negative as well as positive regulation of transcription initiation (19Perederina A. Svetlov V.

Although it requires reorientation of the pair of acidic residues, it has been proposed that DksA might anchor (p)ppGpp in one of two possible orientations near the catalytic center through Mg2+ ions jointly coordinated by ppGpp pyrophosphate residues, thereby stabilizing the bound co-factor and potentiating its regulatory effects (19Perederina A. Svetlov V. Vassylyeva M.N. Tahirov T.H. Yokoyama S. Artsimovitch I. Vassylyev D.G. Cell. 2004; 118: 297-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Whether the regulatory effect of ppGpp and DksA is positive or negative seems largely specified by the promoter discriminator sequence between the –10 and +1 region, as predicted long ago (23Travers A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 973-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DksA and ppGpp exert strong negative regulation of rrnB P1 and other ribosomal RNA promoters. This regulation is argued to result from enhanced destabilization and closure of RNAP-rrnB P1 promoter open complexes together with weakened dependence on the initiating NTP (for review, see Ref. 22Paul B.J. Ross W. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 749-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Positive regulation of some promoters for amino acid biosynthetic genes is attributed mainly to increasing the rate of isomerization between closed and open complexes (21Paul B.J. Berkmen M.B. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7823-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Here, we present experiments designed to test the hypothesis that the three secondary channel binding proteins (GreA/B, DksA) can mutually compete for RNA polymerase despite known differences in the step of transcription at which they function. Growth Conditions, Strains, and Plasmids—Escherichia coli K-12 strains used in this work (supplemental Table S1) were grown in LB broth at 37 °C with appropriate antibiotic concentrations as follows: chloramphenicol, 20 μg/ml; kanamycin, 40 μg/ml; tetracycline, 20 μg/ml; ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; spectinomycin, 50 μg/ml. Strains were constructed by P1vir transduction (24Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) with the following donors: CF1693 (25Xiao H. Kalman M. Ikehara K. Zemel S. Glaser G. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5980-5990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a source for ΔspoT207::cat, ΔrelA251::kan. Strains CLT254, as a source of greA::cat, and CLT255, as a source of greB::kan, were obtained from Dr. R. Weisberg. Plasmid pBW, containing the rrnB P1P2 region spanning from –235 to +237 bp (using P1 as a reference) was constructed by removing a 370-bp rrnB T1T2 terminator fragment from plasmid pPS1 (26Sarmientos P. Sylvester J.E. Contente S. Cashel M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1337-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and ligating it to an EcoRI and HindIII fragment containing the rrnB P1P2 region from –235 bp to +237 bp (obtained by PCR using chromosomal DNA templates). The rrnB P1 promoter template (–180 to +109 bp) was generated by PCR using pBW plasmid as template and the following primers: rrnB–180 (5′-TGCCTTTTGTATGGCAATGAC-3′) and rrnB+109 (5′-AATACGCCTTCCCGCTACA-3′). The ensuing 289-bp fragment was purified using the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Diagnostics) before use as template. We elected to use a linear template with a single promoter for all assays because inhibitory functions of DksA on rrnB P1 have been reported to be independent of superhelicity of the DNA template (21Paul B.J. Berkmen M.B. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7823-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Plasmid pHM1506 was derived from pGB2 with a PSC101 origin conferring spectinomycin resistance (27Churchward G. Belin D. Nagamine Y. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 31: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and was modified to contain lacIq and used for expressing native dksA from the Ptac promoter. For purification of C-terminal His-tagged DksA, pHM1501 was constructed by PCR cloning of the dksA open reading frame from pJK537 (28Brown L. Gentry D. Elliott T. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) in pET21 (Novagen). The inability of the ΔdksA strain CF9239 to grow on glucose minimal medium is complemented by pHM1506. Plasmids used for in vivo experiments as well as purification of native GreA and native GreB were pDNL278 and pGF296, respectively (29Feng G.H. Lee D.N. Wang D. Chan C. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22282-22294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase Assays—Assays for reporter activity were as described (24Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Protein Purification—His-DksA encoded by pHM1501 was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns as described by Qiagen, then dialyzed against storage buffer (0.2 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 0.05 m EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m NaCl, 50% glycerol). GreA and GreB were purified as described in Ref. 29Feng G.H. Lee D.N. Wang D. Chan C. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22282-22294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. In Vitro Transcription—Transcription assays were performed in a reaction volume of 20 μl at 30 °C, using 10 nm template and 30 nm RNAP (E. coli holoenzyme from Epicenter Technologies) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgAc, 10 mm β-mercapthoethanol, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 90 mm potassium glutamate, 100 μm ATP, GTP, and CTP, and 10 μm UTP (10 μCi/reaction [α-32P]UTP, Amersham Biosciences), and either 250 μm GDP or 250 μm ppGpp. RNAP was preincubated (25 °C) with GDP or ppGpp for 7 min prior to the addition of potassium glutamate, and unless stated otherwise, this was followed by a 7-min incubation at 30 °C with DNA and the indicated GreA and/or DksA concentrations (0–600 nm). The reactions were initiated by adding NTP substrates and terminated after 10 min by the addition of an equal volume of stop solution (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). In experiments varying the order of addition of GreA and DksA, the protein added first was preincubated with RNAP and DNA, and the second protein was added together with NTPs. In single round experiments, 100 μg/ml heparin was added. Samples were analyzed on 7 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels and quantified by phosphor-imaging on a GE Healthcare imaging system. Promoter Escape and Open Complex Stability Assays—Promoter escape and open complex stability assays were as described in Ref. 30Potrykus K. Wegrzyn G. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol.

DNase I Footprinting Assay—End-labeled DNA fragments were generated by PCR using 32P-end-labeled rrnB–180 and unlabeled rrnB+109 primers, and purified using the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Diagnostics). RNAP (0–100 nm) was preincubated with 500 μm GDP, or ppGpp, at room temperature for 7 min in transcription buffer, then labeled DNA template (3 nm final) was added together with potassium glutamate (90 mm final), 600 nm GreA, and/or 600 nm DksA. The final reaction volume was 20 μl. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, treated with DNase I (7.5 ng/reaction; Promega Corp.) for 6 min, terminated by addition of EDTA (25 mm final), concentrated by vacuum evaporation, and resuspended in 20 μl of loading buffer (80% formamide, 6 m urea, 10 mm NaOH, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). The samples were resolved on 7 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gels, run in parallel with sequencing reactions obtained by using unlabeled DNA fragment as a template with 32P-end labeled rrnB–180 primer. KMnO4 Footprinting Assay—KMnO4 footprinting of the open complexes was performed as described in Ref. 30Potrykus K. Wegrzyn G. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19860-19866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, except that the open complexes were allowed to form for 15–30 min before incubating under reaction conditions as described above for the DNase I footprinting. When specified, ATP and CTP were added at 100 μm each. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—These studies were performed as described in Ref. 31Maitra A. Shulgina I. Hernandez V.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 817-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar. When employed, ppGpp was added at 500 μm, GreA concentration was 600 nm. The template concentration was 3 nm, and the RNAP concentration was varied. DksA and GreA/B Effects in Vivo—The structural study of GreA, GreB, and DksA suggests that they might compete for their interactions with RNAP. We tested this hypothesis in vivo, using an rrnB P1::lacZ ribosomal promoter operon fusion (32Hernandez V.J. Bremer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11605-11614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Vinella D. Cashel M. D'Ari R. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1483-1492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) known to be negatively regulated by DksA and ppGpp (22Paul B.J. Ross W. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 749-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Plasmids allowing IPTG-inducible Ptac driven expression of native GreA (pDNL278), GreB (pGF296), or DksA (pHM1506) (Fig. 1, top, middle, and lower rows) were introduced into strains with or without ppGpp (left two columns and right two columns, respectively). Reporter activities were measured during a cycle of growth in LB broth, with or without IPTG. We also introduced mutations into each series of strains eliminating potential competing proteins (second and fourth columns). Fig. 1 shows differential plots of reporter activities versus turbidity (A600) during growth cycles. For sufficiently low values of A600, these curves are approximately linear; the slope of such a curve is the differential rate of synthesis; these values are given in Table 1, expressed as Miller units (24Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics.

This confirms that DksA is a negative regulator of rrnB P1 transcription. Loss of GreA, in contrast, had no effect. Fig. 1 also shows that the promoter activity of the wild type strain shut down when a critical cell density was reached (A600 ∼ 2.0). No arrest was observed in the absence of DksA and arrest occurred later in the absence of ppGpp. Despite uncertainties regarding an absolute requirement for ppGpp during entry into stationary phase, this is qualitatively consistent with a requirement for both ppGpp and DksA to restrict P1 transcription late in growth in LB broth (20Paul B.J. Barker M.M. Ross W. Schneider D.A. Webb C. Foster J.W. Gourse R.L. Cell. 2004; 118: 311-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 28Brown L. Gentry D. Elliott T. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 34Aviv M. Giladi H. Oppenheim A.B. Glaser G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 140: 71-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same arrest was observed at high cell densities when the strains were transformed with the three plasmids, so long as the plasmids were uninduced. Major differences were observed, however, when the proteins were induced with IPTG. Some induced conditions were unexpectedly inhibitory for growth, such as inducing GreA (but not GreB) in a dksA mutant and inducing DksA in all strains. We therefore reduced the inducing concentration of IPTG from the standard 1 to 0.01 mm (Fig. 1, panels B and D) or 0.1 mm (panels I–L). These adjustments of IPTG also yield roughly similar levels of each protein that approximate the staining intensities of the most abundant E. coli proteins in crude extracts (supplemental Fig. S1). In wild type cells, increasing GreA levels activated rrnB P1 transcription (Fig. 1A, Table 1). Simply transforming the wild type strain with pgreA mildly elevated the specific activity 1.4 times (+/–ppGpp) and IPTG induction further activated for a total of 3.4 times. A dksA mutation in the otherwise wild type strain increased its specific activity 2.4 times and transforming with pgreA further activated fusion 1.4 times (in the absence of ppGpp), again for a total of 3.4 times. In this case, however, no further activation was observed after IPTG addition, but rather a slight decrease was observed (from 250 to 211 units). This did not result from a difference in GreA expression in the dksA mutant: protein staining indicated that the mutant did not induce GreA without IPTG but induced it normally when IPTG was added (supplemental Fig. S1). That equal levels of rrnB P1 activation occur at such different levels of GreA may mean that activation has reached a saturation limit. Indeed, this specific activity limit of 251 units was exceeded only once, 294 units, in an uninduced dksA mutant in the absence of ppGpp (Table 1). Nevertheless, the activation of rrnB P1 by GreA (at its uninduced level) is potentiated by the absence of DksA. Comparing the middle row of panels in Fig. 1 to the top row reveals that the pgreB plasmid had little effect in the absence of inducer. Even with IPTG, activation of rrnB P1 promoter activity was not observed in the wild type strain (Fig. 1, A and E) and was barely noticeable in the dksA+ ppGpp0 strain (Fig. 1G). However, inducing the pgreB plasmid did alleviate the rrnB P1 arrest late in the growth cycle (Fig. 1E). Panels F and H show that the dksA mutant again failed to arrest, as in panels B and D. Shortly after addition of IPTG to growing cells containing pdksA, reporter expression abruptly stopped in all strains (Fig. 1, I–L); this arrest in rrnB P1 activity did not require ppGpp or GreA. Note that the ordinate scale in the last row of panels (I–L) is amplified 4 times relative to the upper row panels to contrast inhibition of rrnB P1 transcription with low activity levels. The block of rrnB P1 transcription when DksA was overexpressed was both more rapid and more complete than the growth limitation observed under these conditions. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that DksA and GreA compete with each other, the latter activating rrnB P1 transcription, the former inhibiting it. They can be viewed as non-physiological responses because of the abnormally high level of IPTG-induced proteins. If physiological function requires a balanced ratio of proteins then simultaneous induction of putative protein competitors should eliminate changes in promoter regulation. To test this, we constructed strains with two compatible plasmids allowing IPTG induction of both DksA (pHM1506) and GreA (pDNL278). Co-induction of DksA and GreA activated rrnB P1 much the same as inducing GreA alone, overriding inhibitory effects of DksA alone (supplemental Fig. S2). Co-induction of GreB and DksA protected cells from inhibitory effects of DksA, but did not activate like GreA (supplemental Fig. S2). Evidently, balanced levels of these proteins have physiological effects regardless of their absolute concentration. These in vivo experiments confirm the negative effect of DksA on rrnB P1 activity and suggest that excess GreA, and to a lesser extent excess GreB, can counteract it. We now ask whether these observations can be reproduced and understood in a purified transcription system. GreA Activation, Not DksA Inhibition, Requires Its Presence during Open Complex Formation—We first asked whether GreA stimulation and DksA inhibition of rrnB P1 transcription occurs during multiround transcription using purified GreA and DksA proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). All transcription experiments employed GDP as a control for the effects of ppGpp. Initially, RNAP (30 nm) was preincubated with 250 μm ppGpp (or 250 μm GDP) together with increasing amounts of GreA, and the reaction was initiated by addition of 10 nm DNA template and NTP substrates. We reasoned that because GreA is implicated in binding to the RNAP secondary channel, preincubation with RNAP might increase its ability to interact with RNAP and activate. However, preincubating with even a 10-fold molar excess of GreA over RNAP did not stimulate transcription (Fig. 2A). Preincubating RNAP with only ppGpp (or GDP) and initiating the reaction with GreA, template, and substrates also failed to reveal GreA activation (Fig. 2B). A modest activation at higher amounts of GreA was noted when the reaction was initiated with GreA and NTPs (Fig. 2C). It became clear that to achieve maximum activation (2 to 2.5 times), GreA had to be present during open complex formation, i.e. in the presence of template, starting the reaction with NTPs (Fig. 2D). As observed in vivo, activation did not require ppGpp but was seen using a 5–10-fold molar excess of GreA over RNAP (Fig. 2D). Fig. 2 also shows the results of similar assays with DksA that affirm its ability to inhibit rrnB P1 transcription, again at a 5–10-fold molar excess over RNAP. Unlike in vivo inhibition by DksA, in vitro inhibition requires ppGpp (Fig. 2, A–D). Clear ppGpp-dependent inhibition was seen under all conditions tested (Fig. 2, A-D), with a somewhat stronger effect when the reactions were started with NTPs. Evidently GreA activates and DksA inhibits rrnB P1 transcription in vitro. Experiments similar to those shown in Fig. 2 were performed with GreB and slight activation was observed with or without ppGpp (data not shown), consistent with data in Fig. 1. Simultaneous Versus Serial Addition of GreA and DksA—We next performed reactions similar to those of Fig. 2C, but asked whether GreA and DksA compete for RNAP at the rrnB P1 promoter. First, GreA and DksA at concentrations varying from 30 to 600 nm were presented simultaneously to a fixed concentration of 30 nm RNAP and 10 nm DNA with ppGpp or GDP, with reactions initiated by substrate addition (Fig. 3, A and B). The first set of reactions showed that DksA with ppGpp could overcome stimulation by GreA even when present in significantly lower concentrations than GreA (Fig. 3A). In the absence of ppGpp, however, DksA was no longer able to overcome GreA activation even at a 20-fold molar excess of DksA over RNAP (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with a strong ppGpp co-factor requirement in vitro for DksA inhibition but not with the ppGpp-independent inhibition observed in vivo when DksA was overproduced (Fig. 1, J and L). Similar results were obtained when these experiments were repeated but allowing only a single round of transcription (data not shown). We then asked whether allowing the first protein to be present during open complex formation could be reversed by a brief exposure to the second protein. This was accomplished under conditions similar to Fig. 2D, but utilizing single round assays and initiating the reaction by the addition of the second protein together with NTP substrates (Fig. 3, C–F). When GreA was added first in the presence of ppGpp, the activation by even a 20-fold molar excess of GreA over RNAP was progressively abolished by initiating the reaction with increasing amounts of DksA, NTP substrates, and heparin (Fig. 3C). Again, this reversal required the presence of ppGpp (Fig. 3D). In contrast, even a 20-fold molar excess of GreA over RNAP did not reverse DksA inhibition in the presence of ppGpp (Fig. 3E). This was not simply because the stimulatory effect of GreA was abolished when it was added after open complexes had formed since control experiments with GDP show that GreA was able to activate rrnB P1 under similar conditions (Fig. 3F), although to a lesser extent than in Fig. 3, B and D. Taken together, these experiments support the conclusion that, in the presence of ppGpp, transcription inhibition by DksA is dominant over in vitro activation of the rrnB P1"

The crystal structure revealed that the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is deeply buried within the protein. A protein involved in Moco insertion and XDH maturation has been identified, which was designated XdhC. XdhC was shown to be essential for the production of active XDH but is not a subunit of the purified enzyme. Here we describe the purification of XdhC and the detailed characterization of its role for XDH maturation. We could show that XdhC binds Moco in stoichiometric amounts, which subsequently can be inserted into Moco-free apo-XDH. A specific interaction between XdhC and XdhB was identified. We show that XdhC is required for the stabilization of the sulfurated form of Moco present in enzymes of the xanthine oxidase family. Our findings imply that enzyme-specific proteins exist for the biogenesis of molybdoenzymes, coordinating Moco binding and insertion into their respective target proteins. So far, the requirement of such proteins for molybdoenzyme maturation has been described only for prokaryotes.

XdhC was shown to be essential for the production of active XDH but is not a subunit of the purified enzyme. Here we describe the purification of XdhC and the detailed characterization of its role for XDH maturation. We could show that XdhC binds Moco in stoichiometric amounts, which subsequently can be inserted into Moco-free apo-XDH. A specific interaction between XdhC and XdhB was identified. We show that XdhC is required for the stabilization of the sulfurated form of Moco present in enzymes of the xanthine oxidase family. Our findings imply that enzyme-specific proteins exist for the biogenesis of molybdoenzymes, coordinating Moco binding and insertion into their respective target proteins. So far, the requirement of such proteins for molybdoenzyme maturation has been described only for prokaryotes. Xanthine oxidoreductase is a complex metalloflavoprotein that catalyzes the hydroxylation of hypoxanthine and xanthine, the last two steps in the formation of urate, using a water molecule as the ultimate source of oxygen incorporated into the product (1Hille R. Sprecher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10914-10917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme exists in two forms; the xanthine dehydrogenase form (XDH; EC1.17.1.4) 2The abbreviations used are: XDH, xanthine dehydrogenase; MPT, molybdopterin;Moco, molybdenum cofactor; bis-MGD, bis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid;, hSO, human sulfite oxidase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. uses NAD+ as electron acceptor, whereas the xanthine oxidase (EC1.17.3.2) form uses O2 as electron acceptor (2Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). Xanthine oxidoreductases are found both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, with the enzymes isolated from bovine milk and Rhodobacter capsulatus being functionally and structurally the best characterized (3Enroth C.

Rajagopalan K.V. Kisker C. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). R. capsulatus XDH is a cytoplasmic enzyme with an (αβ)2 heterodimeric structure, with the two subunits encoded by the xdhA and xdhB genes, respectively (5Leimkühler S. Kern M. Solomon P.S. McEwan A.G. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Klipp W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 853-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It was shown that XdhA binds the two [2Fe-2S] clusters and the FAD cofactor, whereas XdhB binds the molybdopterin (MPT) form of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) (4Truglio J.J. Theis K. Leimkuhler S.

Mendel R.R. Klipp W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 853-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis revealed that a third gene is co-transcribed with xdhAB, designated xdhC (6Leimkühler S. Klipp W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown by interposon mutagenesis that the xdhC gene product is required for XDH activity; however, XdhC was not identified as a subunit of active XDH (4Truglio J.J. Theis K. Leimkuhler S. Rappa R. Rajagopalan K.V. Kisker C. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 6Leimkühler S. Klipp W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the Moco content of inactive XDH purified from an R. capsulatus xdhC– strain showed that in the absence of XdhC, Moco is not inserted into XDH, but XDH still consisted of an (αβ)2 heterodimer with a full complement of FeS clusters and FAD (6Leimkühler S. Klipp W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An interaction of XdhC with apo-XDH was not analyzed; however, studies of the electrophoretic mobility revealed a different conformation of Moco-free XDH in xdhC– and Moco-deficient R. capsulatus mutant strains in comparison with mature XDH (6Leimkühler S. Klipp W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was assumed that during Moco biosynthesis, the Moco-free apo-XDH stays in a suitable “open” conformation for the insertion of Moco into XdhB. XdhC was proposed to act as an XDH-specific Moco carrier protein, a Moco insertase, or a chaperone involved in proper folding during or after the insertion of Moco into XDH. In previous work, we have reported a system for the heterologous expression of R. capsulatus XDH in Escherichia coli (7Leimkühler S. Hodson R. George G.N. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20802-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Whereas preparations of bovine milk XDH/xanthine oxidase typically possess a large quantity of the desulfo form of the enzyme (8Massey V. Komai H. Palmer G. Elion G.B. Vitam. Horm. 1970; 28: 505-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), R. capsulatus XDH can be purified from E. coli cells in a form with a full complement of the equatorial Mo=S ligand required for functionality (9Leimkühler S. Stockert A.L. Igarashi K. Nishino T. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40437-40444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This shows that E. coli contains a sulfurtransferase capable of adding the terminal sulfur ligand to the molybdenum site of Moco; however, nothing is yet known about the nature of this protein in E. coli. This report describes the detailed analysis for the requirement of XdhC to produce active XDH during heterologous expression in E. coli TP1000 cells. Analysis of XDH expressed under different aeration levels in the presence or absence of XdhC showed that, especially under aerobic conditions, XdhC is required to produce active XDH containing the terminal sulfur ligand of Moco. In addition, we purified and characterized XdhC after heterologous expression in E. coli. We could show that XdhC binds Moco/MPT in stoichiometric amounts and is able to insert bound Moco into Moco-free apo-XDH. In addition, a specific interaction between XdhC and XdhB was identified. We showed that XdhC acts as a Moco-binding protein, which protects the sulfurated form of Moco from oxidation. We propose that sulfurated Moco is inserted into apo-XDH by the aid of XdhC to produce active XDH. This is the first example of a system-specific protein involved in maturation of a molybdoenzyme for which Moco binding could be shown. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Media, and Growth Conditions—E. coli ER2566(DE3) cells and plasmid pTYB2 were obtained from New England Biolabs, and expression vector pET29b was purchased from Novagen. E. coli TP1000 cells (10Palmer T. Santini C.-L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) were used for expression of XDH from pSL207 (7Leimkühler S. Hodson R. George G.N. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20802-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and for expression of the Moco domain of human sulfite oxidase (hSO) from pTG818 (11Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moco-free apo-XDH was obtained after expression in E. coli RK5200 (chlA::Mu cts [moaA–]) (12Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 117-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molybdenum-free hSO was obtained after expression in E. coli RK5202 (chlD202::Mu cts [modC–]) (13Miller J.B. Scott D.J. Amy N.K. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1853-1860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of XDH from pSL181 was carried out in E. coli RK4353(DE3) cells (14Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). His6-tagged CsdA was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) from plasmid pSL215 and purified as described previously (15Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cell strains containing expression vectors were grown aerobically in LB medium at 30 °C in the presence of either 150 μg/ml ampicillin or 25 μg/ml kanamycin. Construction of Expression Vectors—For expression of xdhB and xdhC, primers were designed to allow cloning into the NdeI and KpnI sites of expression vector pTYB2, resulting in plasmid pAK22 and pAK20, respectively. For construction of pSL181, the NdeI-HindIII xdhABC fragment from pSL207 was cloned into pET29b, resulting in a C-terminal His6 fusion to XdhC. pMS3 was obtained from pSL207 by deletion of a 500-bp XhoI fragment in the coding sequence of xdhC. Expression and Purification of XdhB and XdhC—For the heterologous expression of R. capsulatus XdhC in E. coli, pAK22 and pAK20 were transformed into E. coli ER2566(DE3). The proteins were expressed and purified following the IMPACT instruction manual (New England Biolabs) as described previously (16Leimkühler S. Freuer A. Santamaria Araujo J.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26127-26134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). XdhB was further purified by an additional gel filtration step. Immediately before use, XdhC was transferred into the required buffer by gel filtration using PD10 columns (GE Healthcare). Heterologous Expression of XDH in the Absence and Presence of XdhC under Different Oxygen Supply—XDH was expressed in E. coli TP1000 or DH5α cells (17Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8210) Google Scholar) with the expression vectors pSL207 (xdhABC) and pMS3 (xdhAB) under different oxygen supply by using shaking rates of 50, 130, and 210 rpm. After expression, XDH was purified by Ni2+-NTA chromatography (Qiagen) and Q-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare). Co-purification of XDH with XdhC—For co-purification of XDH with XdhC, pSL181 was transformed using the E. coli RK4353(DE3) strain, and cells were grown in 1 liter of LB medium. For purification of the C-terminal His6-tagged XdhC, 0.5 ml of Ni2+-NTA matrix was used. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of 50 mm phosphate buffer, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm imidazole and 20 column volumes of the buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. The proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole and immediately analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Moco was extracted from 1 ml of 390 μm hSO and added to the crude extract in conjunction with 80 μm Na2MoO4 prior to Ni2+-NTA chromatography. XDH showed no interactions with the Ni2+-NTA matrix under these conditions. Moco was quantified as Form A. Sulfuration of Moco Bound to XdhC by CsdA—240 μm CsdA was persulfurated by incubation with 10 mm l-cysteine for 15 min at 4 °C, and excess cysteine was removed by passage through a PD10 column. For in vitro sulfuration experiments, 3 μm XdhC was incubated in a total volume of 0.5 ml under anaerobic conditions with 32 μm Moco extracted from hSO, 60 μm CsdA, and 150 μm sodium dithionite for 30 min. CsdA was removed by Ni2+-NTA chromatography (0.5-ml bed volume) equilibrated in 50 mm phosphate buffer, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and a volume of 1 ml of the flow-through was collected and incubated with 0.75 μm apo-XDH for 2 h. Control experiments were carried out without inclusion of XdhC, CsdA, or sodium dithionite in the incubation mixtures. As positive controls, either 60 μm sodium sulfide was added to the incubation mixtures containing XdhC for chemical sulfuration of Moco or 32 μm Moco extracted from active XDH. Enzyme Assays—XDH assays were performed at room temperature using a Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer. 1 ml of mixture contained 500 μm xanthine and 1 mm NAD+ in 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. The specific enzyme activity (units/mg) is defined as the reduction of 1 μmol of NAD+/min/mg of enzyme. Metal and Moco/MPT Analysis—The molybdenum and iron contents of the purified proteins were quantified by inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Optima 2100 DV ICP-OES. 500 μl of a 10 μm solution was mixed with 500 μl 65% nitric acid and incubated overnight at 100 °C before the addition of 4 ml of water. As reference, the multielement standard solution XVI (Merck) was used. Moco/MPT was quantified by conversion to Form A as described earlier (16Leimkühler S. Freuer A. Santamaria Araujo J.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26127-26134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moco/MPT was extracted by the addition of 50 μl of acidic iodine. Following incubation at room temperature for 14 h, excess iodine was removed by the addition of 55 μl of 1% ascorbic acid, and the sample was adjusted with 1 m Tris to pH 8.3. The phosphate monoester of Form A was cleaved by the addition of 40 mm MgCl2 and 1 unit of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. After the addition of 10 μl of acetic acid, Form A was identified and quantified by HPLC analysis with a C18 reversed phase HPLC column (4.6 × 250-mm ODS Hypersil; particle size 5 μm) with 5 mm ammonium acetate, 15% methanol at an isocratic flow rate of 1 ml/min. In-line fluorescence was monitored by an Agilent 1100 series detector with an excitation at 383 nm and emission at 450 nm. For quantification of Form A, the corresponding fractions were collected, and the concentration was determined as described earlier (18Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of the Cyanolyzable Sulfur—250 μl of a 13 μm XDH in 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.6, was incubated with 27.5 μl of 1 m KCN overnight at 4 °C as originally described by Massey and Edmondson (19Massey V. Edmondson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6595-6598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was separated with a 3000 molecular weight cut-off Centricon concentrator (Millipore), and 250 μl of the SCN–-containing flow-through was mixed with 250 μl of ferric nitrate reagent (10 g of Fe(NO3)3 × 9H2O and 20 ml of 65% HNO3 per 150 ml). The FeSCN– complex was quantified at 460 nm using a standard curve from 1–100 mm KSCN. Generation of Free Moco/MPT—The Moco domain of hSO was expressed from pTG818 in E. coli TP1000 and purified as described by Temple et al. (11Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To 200 μl of hSO (220 μm in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2), 50 μl of 1 m Na2MoO4 was added prior to heat treatment at 95 °C for 5 min. After centrifugation at maximum speed for 5 min, the supernatant was used as a Moco source. For purification of molybdenum-free MPT, hSO was expressed from pTG818 in E. coli RK5202 (13Miller J.B. Scott D.J. Amy N.K. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1853-1860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without the addition of 1 mm Na2MoO4, and Na2MoO4 was omitted from the incubation mixtures. The sulfurated form of Moco was obtained from 80% active XDH using the same procedure. Reconstitution of Apo-XDH with Moco—To obtain Moco-free XDH, pSL207 was expressed in E. coli RK5200 (moaA–) cells, and apo-XDH was purified immediately before use by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. Varying amounts of XdhC (0–15 μm) were incubated with an excess of purified Moco from hSO at 4 °C. Unbound Moco was removed from the incubation mixtures by gel filtration using Nick columns (GE Healthcare). The amount of Moco bound to XdhC was quantified by conversion to Form A, and the Form A concentration was determined using a Form A standard curve. 300 μl of Moco-XdhC was incubated with 100 μl of 4 μm apo-XDH for 90 min at 4 °C. After incubation, XDH was separated from XdhC by Ni2+-NTA chromatography. As control, different concentrations of free Moco (0–35 μm) were incubated with apo-XDH. The amount of Moco inserted into XDH was quantified by conversion to Form A. The same procedure was used to insert the sulfurated form of Moco (obtained from heat-treated XDH) into apo-XDH in the presence or absence of XdhC. 2 μm XdhC were preincubated with Moco for 5, 30, or 60 min at 4 °C before the addition of 0.8 μm apo-XDH. In parallel, extracted Moco was incubated without any additions before the addition of apo-XDH at the same time points. After an incubation time of 2 h at 4 °C, XDH activity was tested. Binding of Moco/MPT to XdhC—6 μm XdhC (in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2) was incubated with free Moco/MPT (0–35 μm) for 15 min at 4 °C. The samples were transferred to Microcon concentrators (molecular weight cut-off 10,000; Millipore) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. As a control, free Moco/MPT was used in the absence of XdhC. The flow-through containing unbound Moco/MPT was converted to Form A and quantified. Fitting was based on the law of mass action for a Moco/MPT to XdhC ratio of n × m. KDapp=[Mocofree]n[XdhCfree]m[XdhCm−Mocon] (Eq. 1) Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—Binding experiments were performed with the surface plasmon resonance-based instrument Biacore™ 2000 and sensor chips CM5, using the control software 2.1 and evaluation software 3.0 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). XDH, apo-XDH, XdhB, and bovine serum albumin were immobilized via amine coupling at 6,000–13,000 resonance units (RU) per flow cell. The running buffer was 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20. XdhC with concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, and 6.4 μm was injected at 25 °C for 4.5 min at a flow rate of 20–40 μl/min followed by a 10–15-min dissociation using kinject and regeneration of the sensor surface with 10–20 mm HCl for 1 min. Binding curves were normalized by substraction of buffer injection curves for all flow cells and XdhC curves for the control flow cell. Heterologous Expression and Purification of R. capsulatus XdhC in E. coli—For purification of XdhC, a fusion protein was generated containing both a C-terminal intein tag and a chitin-binding domain for affinity purification. After binding to chitin beads, cleavage with dithiothreitol resulted in purified XdhC in a soluble form with a yield of 0.2 mg of protein/liter of E. coli culture (Fig. 1). The purified protein displayed a single band on Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a monomeric mass of 33 kDa, which is in close correspondence to the calculated monomeric mass of 33.4 kDa. The observed elution position of native XdhC from a size exclusion chromatography suggested that XdhC exists as a dimer in solution (data not shown). Characterization of the Role of XdhC for the Maturation of R. capsulatus XDH in E. coli—As reported previously, XdhC was shown to be essential for the insertion of Moco into XDH when expressed in R. capsulatus under anaerobic conditions, but not for XDH heterologously expressed under aerobic conditions in E. coli TP1000 cells, containing a deletion in the mobAB genes (6Leimkühler S. Klipp W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Leimkühler S. Hodson R. George G.N. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20802-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, in both cases, XDH was found to be inactive. To determine whether different aeration levels during expression influence the levels of Moco insertion into XDH, R. capsulatus XDH was expressed in E. coli TP1000 cells in the presence or absence of XdhC under variation of shaking velocities (50, 130, and 210 rpm). XDH was purified (see “Experimental Procedures”), and XDH activity was determined, in addition to the content of molybdenum, iron, cyanolyzable sulfur, and MPT in the enzyme (Table 1). As shown in Table 1, XdhC was not required for the insertion of MPT into XDH; however, increasing aeration resulted in lower levels of MPT in the purified protein. Analysis of the molybdenum content of the proteins corresponded well with the MPT content, showing that mainly all MPT bound to the protein is present as Moco. In addition, all enzyme preparations contained the appropriate levels of FeS and FAD cofactors, as judged by their respective visible absorption spectra (data not shown) and by determination of the iron content (Table 1). However, XDH activity was drastically decreased in the absence of XdhC with increasing levels of culture aeration (Table 1). Whereas XDH expressed in the absence of XdhC at 50 rpm under semianaerobic conditions retained 30% of its activity, the protein expressed at 210 rpm was almost inactive. Analysis of the terminal Mo=S ligand required for XDH activity showed that loss of enzyme activity correlated well with a low concentration of the cyanolyzable sulfur present in Moco. Thus, during heterologous expression in E. coli TP1000, XdhC is not required for Moco insertion into XDH, but in particular under aerobic conditions XdhC is essential for the stabilization of the sulfurated form of Moco. We also investigated whether the presence of Moco in XDH in the absence of XdhC is due to the usage of E. coli TP1000 cells for expression, which accumulate Moco to unphysiological high levels due to an impaired conversion of Moco into bis-MGD. Our analyses showed that expression of xdhAB in DH5α cells under high culture aeration resulted in an inactive, Moco-free XDH (data not shown), consistent with the results obtained for XDH purified from R. capsulatus xdhC– cells. Thus, under physiological concentrations of Moco, XdhC is essential for Moco insertion into XDH both in R. capsulatus and E. coli.TABLE 1Effect of XdhC on activity and cofactor content of R. capsulatus XDH after heterologous expression in E. coli TP1000 cells under different culture aerationrpm Values, expression of genes on plasmid usedMolybdenumaMolybdenum (μm molybdenum/μm XDH) and iron (μm 2[2Fe2S]/μm XDH) were determined by ICP-OES (see “Experimental Procedures”) using a multielement standard.

Open table in a new tab Analysis of Moco/MPT Binding to XdhC—From the previous results, the question arose whether XdhC is able to bind Moco and might act as a Moco insertase for XDH, inserting the sulfurated form of Moco and protecting it from oxidation. Since hSO contains the MPT form of Moco and can be purified in large quantities (11Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), recombinant, heat-denatured hSO was chosen as a source of Moco/MPT for binding studies. To compare differences in binding of MPT or Moco to XdhC, Moco was obtained from the Moco domain of hSO expressed in TP1000 cells in the presence of molybdate, whereas molybdenum-free MPT was obtained from inactive hSO expressed in RK5202(modC–) cells in the absence of molybdate. To determine the dissociation constants of Moco/MPT to XdhC, purified XdhC was incubated with extracted Moco/MPT for 15 min before unbound Moco/MPT were separated by ultrafiltration using a membrane with a molecular weight cut-off of 10,000. The Moco/MPT concentration in the flow-through was quantified after conversion to the stable, fluorescent oxidation product Form A (see “Experimental Procedures”). Quantification of Moco/MPT after ultrafiltration in the presence and absence of XdhC allowed the determination of KD values of Moco/MPT binding to XdhC (Fig. 2). The amount of Moco/MPT bound to XdhC and free XdhC concentrations were calculated according to the determined free and total Moco concentrations and the given total XdhC concentration. Fitting revealed a function according to the law of mass action for a Moco/MPT-XdhC-ratio of 1:1, with a Moco saturation of 0.97 ± 0.06 (Fig. 2A) and a MPT saturation of 0.95 ± 0.11 (Fig. 2B). A KD value of 3.6 ± 0.1 μm was obtained for Moco binding, and a KD value of 3.5 ± 0.3 μm was obtained for MPT binding to XdhC at 4 °C, showing that XdhC is able to bind both molecules with the same efficiency in stoichiometric amounts. Analysis of the Ability of XdhC to Insert Moco into Apo-XDH—Further, it was of interest to determine whether XdhC is also able to transfer the bound Moco into purified Moco-free apo-XDH. Moco-containing XdhC was incubated with freshly purified apo-XDH for 90 min at 4 °C, before XdhC was removed from the incubation mixture by affinity chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). Since the Moco used for this experiment was obtained from hSO containing the dioxo form of Moco lacking the terminal sulfur ligand required for XDH activity, the reconstitution of XDH with Moco could not be determined by regaining XDH activity. Thus, to determine the amount of Moco present in reconstituted XDH, the protein was subjected to iodine oxidation to produce the fluorescent Form A derivative of the cofactor, which can be quantified by HPLC analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, XdhC was able to insert bound Moco into Moco-free apo-XDH. The control experiment using free Moco showed the same level of Moco insertion into XDH. A half-maximal Moco insertion at 4 °C was observed at a Moco/XDH ratio of about 2:1. The achievable saturation level of XDH with Moco depended on the preparation of XDH and, as shown in Fig. 3A, was in the range of about 15%. A control experiment using bovine serum albumin instead of XDH showed that Moco insertion was specific to apo-XDH (data not shown). This reconstitution efficiency is less than the in vitro insertion of Moco described for hSO, where about 5"

The extracellular domains of these proteins contain six amino acid loops (A–F) that converge to form the ligand binding site. In this study we have mutated 21 residues in or close to the 5-HT3 receptor F-loop (Ile192 to Gly212) to Ala or to a residue with similar chemical properties. Mutant receptors were expressed in HEK293 cells, and binding affinity was measured using [3H]granisetron.

Homology modeling using acetylcholine-binding protein crystal structures with a variety of different bound ligands suggests there may be distinct movements of Trp195 and Asp204 upon ligand binding, indicating that these residues and their immediate neighbors have the ability to interact differently with different ligands. The models suggest predominantly lateral movement around Asp204 and rotational movement around Trp195, indicating the former is in a more flexible region.

It is a member of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels that also includes the nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh), zinc-activated, glycine, GABAA and GABAC receptors. The functional receptors consist of five symmetrically arranged subunits that surround a centrally located ion-conducting pore. Each subunit has a large extracellular N-terminal domain, four transmembrane domains (M1–M4), and a large intracellular loop between M3 and M4. The ligand binding site is located in the extracellular domain and is formed at the interface of two adjacent subunits (1Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

In the 5-HT3 receptor, five subunits (A–E) have been identified, although only homomeric 5-HT3A or heteromeric 5-HT3A/B subunit complexes have been functionally expressed and characterized (5Davies P.A.

J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have identified a number of key residues involved in binding and have shown that the amino acids responsible for the receptor-ligand interaction are located in six convergent loops (A–F). In addition, structural insight has been gained from cryoelectron microscopy of the nACh receptor and from the crystal structures of the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP), a soluble protein that is homologous to the extracellular region of Cys-loop receptors (8Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J.

However, there are some important structural and functional differences between AChBP and Cys-loop receptors. For example, AChBP lacks a channel and shows little cooperativity in ligand binding, and it is not clear whether AChBP best resembles an activated, resting, or desensitized state of the nACh receptor (9Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

This suggests that differences in binding in these, and in other related proteins, may be due to differences in their F loops, whose crystal structure is poorly resolved in all of the AChBP structures to date, and whose sequence is poorly conserved both between subunits of the same receptor type and between different members of the same Cys-loop family (1Corringer P.J.

To date, only the GABAA α1 and GABAC ρ1 subunits have received a comprehensive study of the residues in the F-loop region, but due to the high levels of sequence variability in this region it is difficult to make comparisons between homologous residues across the Cys-loop family (13Newell J.G.

To gain a better understanding of the role of the F-loop in ligand binding in the 5-HT3 receptor, we have mutated 21 consecutive amino acids in this region (Ile192 to Gly212) and created a series of structural models of this region using a variety of AChBP crystal structures. Our results demonstrate the importance of the 5-HT3 receptor F-loop region in ligand binding. Materials—All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen, except fetal calf serum, which was from Labtech International (Ringmer, UK). [3H]Granisetron (63.5 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were of the highest obtainable grade. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained on 90-mm tissue culture plates at 37 °C and 7% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. They were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nutrient Mix F12 (1:1) with GlutaMAX™ I media containing 10% fetal calf serum and passaged when confluent. For radioligand binding studies, cells in 90-mm dishes were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation at 80–90% confluency and incubated for 3–4 days before use (16Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). For functional studies cells were transfected by electroporation using the AMAXA system (Amaxa GmbH, Cologne, Germany), plated on 96-well plates, and incubated 1–2 days before assay. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis reactions were performed using the method described by Kunkel (18Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar). The 5-HT3A subunit DNA (accession: AY605711) has been described previously (19Hargreaves A.C. Lummis S.C. Taylor C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1120-1128PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were designed according to the recommendations of Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar) and some suggestions of the Primer Generator (Ref. 21Turchin A. Lawler Jr., J.F. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar; www.med.jhu.edu/medcenter/primer/primer.cgi). A silent restriction site was incorporated into each primer to assist rapid identification. Radioligand Binding—This was undertaken as previously described (22Lummis S.C. Sepulveda M.I. Kilpatrick G.J. Baker J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 243: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, transfected HEK293 cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline and then scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) containing the following proteinase inhibitors: 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 50 μg/ml bacitracin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and frozen at –20 °C. After thawing, they were washed twice with HEPES buffer, resuspended, and 50 μg of cell membranes was incubated in 0.5 ml of HEPES buffer containing the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist [3H]granisetron. Saturation binding (eight point) assays were performed on at least three separate plates of transfected cells for each mutant using 0.1–40 nm [3H]granisetron. Nonspecific binding, determined using 1 μm quipazine, was routinely 5–10% of total binding. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4°C and terminated by rapid vacuum filtration using a Brandel cell harvester onto GF/B filters pre-soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine followed by two rapid washes with 4 ml of ice-cold HEPES buffer. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (Beckman LS6000sc). Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin standards. Data were analyzed by iterative curve fitting (Prism, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) according to the equation, B = (Bmax·[L])/(K + [L]), where B is bound radioligand, Bmax is maximum binding at equilibrium, K is the equilibrium dissociation constant, [L] is the free concentration of radioligand. Values are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance in conjunction with Dunnett's post test. Immunofluorescence—This was as described previously (23Spier A.D. Wotherspoon G. Nayak S.V. Nichols R.A. Priestley J.V. Lummis S.C.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 71: 369Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells were washed with three changes of Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl) and fixed using ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB, 66 mm Na2HPO4, 38 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2). After two TBS washes, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in pAb120 at 1:1600 in TBS. Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and fluorescein isothiocyanate avidin D (Vector) were used to detect bound antibody as per the manufacturer's instructions. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector). Immunofluorescence was observed using an UltraVIEW™ LCI Confocal Imaging System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). FLEXstation™ Analysis—This was as previously described (24Price K.L. Lummis S.C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2005; 149: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were gently rinsed twice with buffer (10 mm HEPES, 115 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4). To each well 50 μl of buffer and 50 μl of fluorescent membrane potential dye (diluted 2:5 in buffer) were added, and the cells were incubated at room temperature for 45 min before assay. Fluorescence was measured in a FLEXstation™ (Molecular Devices Ltd., Wokingham, UK) every 2 s for 200 s using the acquisition software SOFTmax® PRO version 4.3. Control (buffer alone) or 5-HT (0.001–30 μm) was added to each well at 20 s. Data were analyzed by iterative curve fitting using Prism version 4.03 (GraphPad Software) according to the equation, F = Fmin +((Fmax – Fmin)/1 + 10(log EC50 – log[L])nH)), where Fmin is the baseline fluorescence at 20 s, Fmax is the maximal fluorescence, EC50 is the concentration required for a half-maximal response, [L] is the concentration of ligand, and nH is the Hill coefficient. Data are reported as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Modeling—This was performed as described previously (12Thompson A.J. Price K.L. Reeves D.C. Chan S.L.

Briefly, the three-dimensional models of the extracellular region of the 5-HT3 receptor were built using MODELLER 6v2 (26Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10448) Google Scholar) based on the crystal structure of AChBP in the unbound, agonist-bound, and antagonist-bound states (PDB codes: 2byn, 1uv6, 2byq, 1yi5, and 2byr). The pentamer was generated by superimposing the 5-HT3 subunit on to each protomer of AChBP, with care taken not to alter the coordinate axes of reference. The generated pentameric model was energy minimized in SYBYL version 6.8 using the AMBER force field by moving side chains alone, to relieve short contacts at the inter-protomer interfaces (27Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). Electrostatic terms were included in these minimization cycles. Effects of Mutations—Each amino acid along a sequence of 21 residues was mutated to either Ala or an amino acid with properties similar to the wild-type amino acid (subsequently referred to as a conserved amino acid change). The position of these residues within the linear sequence of the 5-HT3 receptor is shown in Fig. 1 and is compared with AChBP and other Cys-loop receptors in Fig. 2.FIGURE 2Alignment of the F-loop residues of members of the Cys-loop family of ligandgated ion channels. Accession numbers for the alignment are as follows: pond snail AChBP, P58154; mouse 5-HT3A, Q6J1J7; rat GABAA α1, P62813; rat nACh γ, P18916; rat nACh δ, P25110; rat nACh ϵ, P09660; and rat glycine α1, P07727.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The [3H]granisetron binding affinity of the mutants is shown in Tables 1 and 2. Changing 10 of the 21 residues resulted in no significant change in affinity for either the Ala or conserved mutation, suggesting these residues do not play a role in ligand binding (Ser197, Glu199, Arg202, Ser203, Ile207, Phe208, Ile209, Asn210, Gln211, and Gly212). For the remaining 11 residues there were differences in binding affinities compared with wild type for one or both of the substitutions, suggesting that these residues have some role in [3H]granisetron binding. These residues were Ile192, Thr193, Leu194, Trp195, Arg196, Pro198, Glu200, Val201, Asp204, Lys205, and Ser206.TABLE 1Effects of Ala substitutions on [3H]granisetron binding affinities to the 5-HT3 receptor&Significantly different from wild type (analysis of variance with Dunnett's post test: p < 0.05).

Effects of Alanine Mutations—Amino acid substitutions to Ala revealed significant changes in the [3H]granisetron binding affinity for 8 of the 21 residues (Table 1). These changes were clustered into two groups at the N and C termini of the linear sequence. The changes to the N-terminal cluster extended from Ile192, which lies immediately adjacent to the B-loop, through to Arg196. From Ser197 to Ser203 all of the substitutions displayed a [3H]granisetron binding affinity similar to wild type. The C-terminal cluster was Asp204, Lys205, and Ser206. D204A displayed no specific binding at the concentrations of [3H]granisetron used in this study. Immunofluorescence confirmed that this mutant was expressed at the cell surface, indicating that the mutation did not impair receptor assembly or membrane trafficking (Fig. 3). Binding was similar to wild type for Ala mutations from Ile207 through to Gly212. Effects of Conserved Mutations—Amino acid substitutions to residues with conserved properties revealed changes in the [3H]granisetron binding affinity for 6 of the 21 residues (Table 2). The N-terminal cluster of residues, centered around Trp195, that was sensitive to Ala mutation remained sensitive to conserved mutations and was extended to also include Pro198, Glu200, and Val201. The C-terminal cluster displayed different properties to the Ala mutants, as conserved mutations at Asp204, Lys205, and Ser206 revealed wild-type binding affinities. Functional Studies—To explore the role of Asp204 and Trp195 in agonist binding, 5-HT-induced responses in receptors with substitutions at these positions were examined using FLEXstation™ analysis. This technique utilizes fluorescent voltage-sensitive dyes to detect changes in the membrane potential (24Price K.L. Lummis S.C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2005; 149: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The EC50 for 5-HT on wild-type receptors was 0.27 ± 0.06 μm (n = 4). Values from D204E mutant receptors were not significantly different to wild type (0.33 ± 0.09 μm, n = 4, p < 0.05), whereas D204A mutant receptors were non-functional up to a 5-HT concentration of 30 μm (n = 8). An increase of ∼10-fold in the EC50 value for W195A receptors was significantly greater than wild-type receptors (3.3 ± 0.5 μm, n = 4, p < 0.05) and was similar to previously published increases for W195Y (4-fold increase) and W195S (9-fold increase) mutants (28Spier A.D. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5620-5625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). F-loop Modeling—To gain further insight into the importance of the F-loop, a series of models were generated, based upon crystal structures of AChBP in different states; unbound (PDB ID: 2byn), agonist-bound (carbamylcholine, PDB ID: 1uv6 and epibatidine, PDB ID: 2byq), and antagonist-bound (2-methyllcaconitine, PDB ID: 2byr and α-cobratoxin, PDB ID: 1yi5) (8Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The lowest energy state for each model is shown in Fig. 4. An overlay of the backbone carbons (Fig. 4F) for each of the models suggests that the F-loop does not undergo rigid body movements but displays conformational flexibility that is dependent upon the bound ligand. To demonstrate this point, the inter-subunit distances between the α-carbon of Trp183 (principal subunit) and the α-carbon of either Trp195 or Asp204 (complementary subunit) were calculated (Table 3). Trp183 was chosen as a reference point, because there is considerable evidence regarding the importance of this residue and it is known to be centrally located within the binding pocket (12Thompson A.J.

The distances between α-carbons of Trp183 residues of adjacent subunits were included as an internal control for widespread disruption of the whole binding site.TABLE 3Distances (Å) from the α-carbon of Trp183 in the principal subunit to the α-carbon of residues across the interface in the complementary subunita Modeled from AChBP with no ligand bound (PDB ID: 2byn).b AChBP with carbamylcholine (PDB ID: 1uv6).c AChBP with epibatidine (PDB ID: 2byq).d AChBP with α-cobratoxin (PDB ID: 1yi5).e AChBP with 2-methyllycaconitine (PDB ID: 2byr).

Comparison of the Trp183 to Trp183 distances for each of the models revealed that these are similar (26.20–27.07 Å) and indicates that any variability in the measurements of Trp195 and Asp204 is unlikely to be the result of macroscopic disruptions of the binding pocket region. Lateral movements of the Trp195 α-carbon positions are small across the range of models, but there are significant rotational movements (Fig. 4, A–E). These are most pronounced for the antagonist-bound models, which show that the side chain of Trp195 rotates clockwise from a 12 o'clock position to a three or six o'clock positions (Fig. 4, E and D). Distances between the α-carbon of Asp204 and the α-carbon of Trp183 in both the agonist-bound structures are greater than in the unbound form, suggesting that there is movement in this region during binding (Table 3). In contrast, binding of the small antagonist does not cause lateral movement, although the greatest movement of Asp204 is seen upon binding of the large antagonist, which causes Asp204 to move away from Trp183 and toward the solvent. This study describes the affects of substitutions across a 21-amino acid stretch that incorporates the 5-HT3 receptor F-loop. Residues were mutated to either Ala or to an amino acid with chemical properties similar to the wild-type residue. Mutation of 11 of the amino acids caused changes in the binding affinity of [3H]granisetron, suggesting that they have a role here. The data revealed two clusters of residues of particular importance, centered around Trp195 and Asp204. Modeling, based upon the structures of AChBP bound to a variety of ligands, supports the hypothesis that the F-loop forms a flexible structure and suggests that upon ligand binding there are specific, but distinct movements of Trp195 and Asp204. Trp195 has previously been identified as a potentially important binding residue in the 5-HT3 receptor: both EC50 values for 5-HT and Kd values for [3H]granisetron were substantially increased when Trp195 was mutated to Tyr or Ser, similar to the observations presented here (28Spier A.D. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5620-5625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As proposed in the previous study, our results support a role for this residue in binding rather than gating, and indeed it may contribute to the aromatic box that is critical for all Cys-loop receptors. Because Trp195 is important, changes in binding affinity observed when mutating the neighboring amino acids may reflect indirect effects resulting from their proximity to Trp195. However, it is more likely, given the range of residues that cause a change in binding affinity when mutated (Ile192–Val201), that other residues in this region also contribute to ligand binding, either directly or via contributions to the structure of the binding site. Our homology models show Trp195 and Arg196 are in close association with residues from other regions of the protein, and therefore may be involved in interactions that permit the correct folding of the binding pocket. For example, Trp195 is <5 Å from Thr64 and Ser66 with which it might hydrogen bond (Table 3). Perhaps surprisingly, the charged side chains of Glu199 and Arg202 do not appear to be important, because both Ala and conserved substitutions do not significantly alter the binding affinity in these mutant receptors. Even an Ala substitution at Pro198 was well tolerated, which was unexpected as studies have shown that a number of 5-HT3 receptor Pro residues are critical for binding and/or function (33Deane C.M. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37962-37966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is not an ideal conservative substitution for proline, although changing it to His (which also has a 5-membered ring but is slightly larger) did cause an increase in Kd, indicating that size may be important here. Size may also play a role at Glu200 and Val201, where a change in binding affinity was observed with conservative but not Ala substitutions. The second cluster of amino acids consists of Asp204, Lys205, and Ser206. D204A was the only Ala mutation in the F-loop that completely ablated binding, indicating the importance of this residue. No functional response was observed with this mutant receptor, although immunofluorescence showed it was capable of reaching the cell surface. This is consistent with the lack of function being due solely to the lack of binding. Interestingly, Asp204 and Lys205 displayed wild-type binding affinities when their positive charges were preserved in the conserved mutations, suggesting the formation of salt-bridges. However, eliminating the charge in the D204N and K205M mutants showed that is not the case. The amino acids aligning with Asp204 in the GABAA α subunit (Val180) and nACh receptor γ (Asp203), δ (Asp208), and ϵ (Asp202) subunits have all been implicated in ligand binding, and the Lys205 equivalent (Ala181) in GABAA receptor α subunits has also been shown to be important (4Sine S.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3160-3164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that this region contributes to ligand binding in all Cys-loop receptors. Despite the lack of structural information, there is evidence from the GABAA receptor that the F-loop may undergo a structural re-arrangement upon ligand binding (13Newell J.G. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13166-13172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Using pentobarbital (which activates the channel at a site remote from the ligand binding site), methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium modification of cysteine mutants indicated that Val180 (which aligns with Asp204 in the 5-HT3 receptor), Ala181 (Lys205), and Arg186 (Asn210) undergo structural changes during ligand binding and/or channel opening. It was also noted that Val178 (Arg202), Val180 (Asp204), and Asp183 (Ile207) are likely to contribute to the receptor binding site. Our homology modeling suggests that there is also movement in the 5-HT3 receptor F-loop region, around the two clusters of residues that were identified as important in our mutagenesis studies. Our data indicate rotational movement in the region of Trp195 and both lateral and rotational movement around Asp204. Trp195 is located immediately downstream of the β8-sheet, and lateral movement here may be limited by the anchoring effect of this rigid β-sheet structure. Interactions between this β-sheet and the region around Trp195 could be important, because the adjacent β9 and β10 strands are part of the C-loop. Therefore, movement around Trp195 could directly affect the C-loop and have an impact on ligand binding or subsequent receptor movement. More structural information, especially comparisons of the closed and open states of the receptor, is needed to support this hypothesis. It is also noteworthy that in some studies researchers have subdivided the F-loop (e.g. Ref. 37Arias H.R. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 36: 595-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Our data would support the idea that there is more than one important region in this loop, but given the structural evidence from AChBP it seems logical to consider the region as a whole until further evidence suggests otherwise. Comparisons of AChBP and nACh receptor structure indicate that conformational changes in the binding site are predominantly within the C- and F-loop regions. The C-loop is proposed to undergo a rigid body movement that changes its position from one that is extended toward the solvent when in the resting state, to one that contracts around the ligand in the agonist-bound conformation (8Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is strong evidence that the F-loop is flexible, and in many of the crystallization studies of AChBP the F-loop is poorly resolved due to its unordered structure (9Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Where we do have structural information, comparisons of the F-loop in AChBP from different species has revealed a high level of variability, supporting the hypothesis that the F-loop may play a role in subunit specific pharmacological characteristics (13Newell J.G. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13166-13172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 38Ranna M. Sinkkonen S.T. Moykkynen T. Uusi-Oukari M. Korpi E.R.

Our models show that there are significant differences in the orientation and positioning of the residues Trp195 and Asp204 that depend upon the ligand but not necessarily on whether the ligand is an agonist or antagonist. The distance of Asp204 from Trp183 (located in the center of the binding site) was similar in both the unbound and small antagonist-bound models, consistent with thinking that antagonists lock the receptor in the resting state. However, the presence of a large antagonist appeared to cause a large lateral displacement of Asp204 away from Trp183 (5.96 Å), providing some support for the recent proposal that large antagonists push the components of the binding pocket further apart (30Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The change in the position of Trp195 was smaller for both small and large antagonists (2.18 and 1.63 Å). Agonists, on the other hand, appear to cause very little displacement of Trp195 (<0.5 Å) but do appear to displace Asp204; in the two agonist-bound models Asp204 is 1.82 and 2.52 Å further away from Trp183 than in the unbound state. These movements may not only contribute to conformational changes within the F-loop but may also influence other closely located binding loops, such as the adjacent β9 and β10 region of the C-loop. In summary, we have shown that residues within the F-loop region, and in particular those centered around Trp195 and Asp204, are critical for antagonist binding in the 5-HT3 receptor. Combining these data with our modeling studies suggests F-loop residues are important contributors to the binding of all ligands and also have the potential to cause or influence conformational changes in or close to the binding pocket. Such changes may be common to all Cys-loop receptors."

Interestingly, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α has been recently demonstrated to hydrolyze fatty acyl-CoAs, followed by binding of the fatty acid product to hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α, thereby allowing cross-talk between the acyl-CoA and free fatty acid binding domains (33Hertz R.

In addition to its regulation by calmodulin, iPLA2β binds ATP through a conserved nucleotide binding motif (GXGXXG), resulting in both enzyme stabilization and activation (34Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14526-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). From this perspective, we considered the possibility that iPLA2β might also bind and hydrolyze long-chain acyl-CoAs, given the structural similarity of the 3′-phosphoadenosine moiety of CoA to ATP. In this paper, we demonstrate that iPLA2β catalyzes the hydrolysis of saturated long-chain acyl-CoAs present as either monomers or as guests in host membrane vesicles at physiologic concentrations (1–5 mol %). Moreover, highly selective autoacylation of iPLA2β by oleoyl-CoA occurred at a second nucleophilic site(s) within the catalytic domain, which is protected from oleoylation by Ca2+-activated calmodulin. Finally, oleoyl-CoA was found to attenuate calmodulin-mediated inhibition of iPLA2β phospholipase A2 activity. In summary, these results describe the previously unrecognized fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase activity and fatty acyl-CoA dependent covalent acylation of iPLA2β, thereby revealing additional levels of complexity in this multifunctional signaling enzyme.

Construction of Recombinant Baculoviruses Encoding His-tagged Wild-type and S465A Mutant iPLA2β Proteins—cDNA encoding wild-type C. griseus (Chinese hamster) iPLA2β (9Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30879-30885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was utilized as template for PCR amplification of the sequence to introduce six in-frame His codons followed by a stop codon and XhoI restriction site (3′ primer) for subcloning into pFASTBac1. The 5′ primer contained a SalI site and Kozak sequence (GCCACC) 5′ of the ATG start codon. The His-tagged S465A iPLA2β construct was created by PCR amplification of the mutant cDNA (9Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30879-30885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) utilizing a 5′ primer containing an EcoRI restriction site and a3′ primer encoding a His6 tag followed by a SalI site for subcloning into pFASTBac1. The 2.4-kb products were each inserted into a bacmid shuttle vector and sequenced in both directions to confirm the integrity of the constructs. S. frugiperda (Sf9) cells in 35-mm plates containing supplemented Grace's medium were transfected and incubated at 27 °C for 72 h to produce high titer baculoviral stocks for infection of Sf9 cells. Expression and Affinity Purification of iPLA2βHis6 from Sf9 Cells—Sf9 cells were grown as 100 ml of suspended cultures (in 1-liter plastic bottles) in supplemented Grace's insect medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 0.1% Pluronic F-68. Following infection of 3 × 100-ml cultures of Sf9 cells (1.5 × 106 cells/ml) with baculovirus encoding iPLA2βHis6 for 48 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation (250 × g for 10 min), washed once with Grace's insect medium without serum, and resuspended in 30 ml of 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 2 mm β-ME, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin. After lysing the cells by sonication (30 1-s bursts), the homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the cytosol, to which NaCl was added to a final concentration of 250 mm. The cytosol was then mixed by inversion with 3 ml of HIS-Select-Co2+ affinity resin (Sigma) for 1 h, and the cytosol-resin suspension was poured into an Amersham Biosciences 1 × 10-cm column. Following washing of the settled resin with 30 ml of Buffer A (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, containing 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 2 mm β-ME), bound protein was eluted from the column at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min utilizing a 250 mm imidazole gradient in Buffer A (50-ml total volume) generated using an Amersham Biosciences fast protein liquid chromatography system. Column fractions were assayed for iPLA2 activity as described below, pooled, and dialyzed overnight against Buffer B (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.8, containing 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EGTA). The dialyzed sample was applied to a 2.5-ml column of ATP-agarose equilibrated with Buffer B and washed with Buffer B containing 1 mm AMP and 50 mm NaCl. Bound iPLA2βHis6 was eluted with Buffer B containing 2 mm ATP and 100 mm NaCl, dialyzed against Buffer B (EGTA concentration was reduced to 0.1 mm) containing 100 mm NaCl, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Approximately 1 mg (65% yield) of iPLA2βHis6 with a specific activity of 0.5 μmol of oleic acid/min/mg, utilizing 5 μm [14C]POPC as substrate, was typically recovered from 300 ml of cultured Sf9 cells by this procedure. Phospholipase A2 and Acyl-CoA Hydrolase Enzymatic Assays—Purified recombinant iPLA2βHis6 (0.1–1 μg) was incubated with radiolabeled phospholipid or acyl-CoA in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm EGTA (200 μl final volume) for 1–2 min at 37 °C. In experiments using acyl-CoAs as guests in host phospholipid bilayers, radiolabeled acyl-CoAs were incorporated into POPC/DOPS (90:10 mol %) vesicles (100 μm) before addition to the reaction mix. Long-chain acyl-CoAs have been previously demonstrated to integrate into lipid bilayers within seconds (37Cohen Simonsen A. Bernchou Jensen U. Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Mouritsen O.G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by extraction of the released radiolabeled fatty acids into 100 μl of butanol, separation of fatty acids from unreacted substrate by thin layer chromatography, and quantitation by scintillation spectroscopy as previous described (38Hazen S.L. Stuppy R.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10622-10630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments examining the effects of acyl-CoAs on calmodulin-mediated inhibition of iPLA2β, phospholipase A2 activity was continuously measured utilizing a SPECTRAmax GEMINI XS Dual-Scanning Microplate Spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices). BODIPY-PC substrate (1.17 mm in Me2SO, 5 μm final concentration) was co-sonicated (10 min at 40% power, 50% duty cycle) with POPC (95 μm final concentration) in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Oleoyl-CoA and CaCl2 were added at the indicated concentration to the lipid vesicles before addition to iPLA2β with or without CaM (preincubated on ice for 10 min) present in individual wells of a black 96-well microtiter plate. Fluorescence readings were acquired at 15-s intervals for 2 min at 37 °C utilizing excitation/emission wavelengths of 495/515 nm, respectively. Electrospray Ionization (ESI)/Mass Spectral (MS) Analyses—Purified iPLA2β (0.25 μg) was incubated with POPC (95 μm) vesicles containing BODIPY-PC (5 μm) for 5 min at 37 °C as described above. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) containing internal standards (i.e. 14:1–14:1 PC and 17:0 LPC), and the lipid species were extracted into the chloroform layer as described previously (39Han X. Gross R.W. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2005; 24: 367-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Extracted lipid samples were filtered with Millex-FG 0.20-μm filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and were routinely stored in 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1/1, v/v) under nitrogen at –20 °C. ESI/MS analysis was performed using a Thermo Finnigan TSQ Quantum Plus spectrometer (San Jose, CA) equipped with an electrospray ion source as previously described in detail (40Han X. Yang J. Cheng H. Ye H. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 330: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 41Han X. Cheng H. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15584-15594Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) (∼5 pmol/μl) prior to direct infusion into the ESI ion source at a flow rate of 4 μl/min with a 2-min period of signal averaging. Tandem mass scanning of neutral loss of 59 atomic mass units (loss of trimethylamine) was performed at a collision energy of 24 eV and a collision gas pressure of 1.0 millitorr. Covalent Modification of iPLA2β with 14C-labeled Long-chain Acyl-CoAs—Purified recombinant iPLA2βHis6 was incubated with POPC vesicles (90 μm) containing 10 mol % [1-14C]acyl-CoA for 1 h at 37 °C. In some experiments, iPLA2βHis6 was preincubated with BEL (3 min at 23 °C), N-ethylmaleimide (5 min at 30 °C) or iodoacetamide (5 min at 30 °C) prior to the addition of radiolabeled acyl-CoA. Chloroform/methanol precipitation of some samples was performed as described (42Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar), utilizing 15 μg of bovine serum albumin as carrier. In experiments to examine the nature of the covalent linkage between oleic acid and iPLA2β, acid (HCl), base (NaOH), and hydroxylamine were added to the indicated concentrations, and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Bovine serum albumin (15 μg) and SDS-PAGE loading buffer were then added to each sample prior to dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 10% glycerol and 1% SDS for 4 h. Samples were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, fixed (40% methanol containing 10% acetic acid), stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, incubated in Amplify fluorographic reagent, dried, and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. Biomax MR film for 2–5 days at –80 °C. Partial Trypsinolysis of Oleoylated iPLA2β—Purified iPLA2βHis6 (10 μm) was incubated with 50 μm [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA or unlabeled oleoyl-CoA in 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.8, containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol for 1 h at 37°C. Excess [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA was removed by using a Micro Bio-Spin (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated with the above buffer. Recovered iPLA2β was partially digested with trypsin (1:25, w/w) for 1–30 min at 37 °C. Tryptic peptides were separated by SDS-PAGE, fixed in 40% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid, stained with Coomassie Blue, and destained in the fixation solution. Gels containing the radiolabeled peptide fragments were soaked in Amplify fluorogenic reagent (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to film. In parallel samples utilizing unlabeled oleoyl-CoA, the band corresponding to the ∼25-kDa radiolabeled fragment was excised, cut into ∼1 × 1-mm pieces, and destained further by washing with 50% acetonitrile at 37 °C. The gel pieces were then dried in a SpeedVac, resuspended in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (100 μl) containing 0.5 μg of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega), and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. After aliquoting the supernatant solution to a separate tube, residual peptides in the gel pieces were extracted into 50% acetonitrile, 20% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, combined with the supernatant solution, and concentrated utilizing a SpeedVac. MALDI-TOF Analysis of iPLA2β Tryptic Fragments—Concentrated peptide samples were diluted with 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, absorbed to a C18 Zip-Tip (Millipore), and desorbed with a solution composed of 50% acetonitrile, 20% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and containing in addition 5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Samples were applied to 192-spot sample plates (ABI) and allowed to air-dry. MS analyses were performed utilizing an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Framingham, MA), which possesses a 200-Hz Nd:YAG laser operating at 355 nm. The mass accuracy of the instrument was externally calibrated to the 4700 Proteomics analyzer calibration mixture of peptides. For MALDI-MS analysis, spectra were obtained by the accumulation of 2500 consecutive laser shots at a collision energy of 1 kV with air serving as the collision gas. Calculations of predicted peptide and peptide fragment masses were performed using programs developed at the University of California, San Francisco, Mass Spectrometry Facility (available on the World Wide Web at prospector.ucsf.edu). Metabolic Labeling of iPLA2β in Intact Sf 9 Cells—Cultures (100 ml) of Sf9 cells (1.5 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with control (pFB empty vector) or iPLA2βHis6-encoding baculovirus and incubated at 27 °C for 45 h. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation (250 × g for 10 min), resuspended in 10 ml of Grace's insect medium (Sigma) containing 1% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.1% Pluronic F-68, and 1 mCi of [3H]oleic acid. Following incubation at 27 °C for 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation (250 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in 5 ml of 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, containing 20% glycerol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. After sonication, cytosol and membrane fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation as described above. Other Procedures—SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). ECL Western analyses for iPLA2βHis6 were performed utilizing a monoclonal anti-His antibody (BD Biosciences) in conjunction with an anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels was performed as described (44Nesterenko M.V. Tilley M. Upton S.J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 28: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by a version of the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. iPLA2β Hydrolyzes Palmitoyl-CoA and Is Inhibited at Submicellar Concentrations of Substrate—Due to the structural similarity between ATP and the 3′-phosphoadenosine moiety of CoA, we hypothesized that iPLA2β could bind to, and potentially hydrolyze, the thioester linkage of long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. Accordingly, we overexpressed iPLA2βHis6 in Sf9 cells and purified the enzyme to apparent homogeneity (as determined by SDS-PAGE/silver staining) by sequential cobalt and ATP affinity chromatographies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Initial assays with iPLA2β utilizing supramicellar concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA (100 μm) typically used for acyl-CoA thioesterases revealed very low rates of hydrolysis (Fig. 1A). Remarkably, robust palmitoyl-CoA thioesterase activity was demonstrated at low micromolar concentrations of substrate with a maximal rate of ∼250 nmol of palmitic acid/min/mg at 2.5 μm palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 1A). Similar acyl-CoA-mediated substrate inhibition was observed in previous studies of a purified rabbit heart mitochondrial thioesterase (45Gross R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 802: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase 2 (46Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-"
https://openalex.org/W2058620905,"Escherichia coli alpha-hemolysin (HlyA), archetype of a bacterial pore-forming toxin, has been reported to deregulate physiological Ca2+ channels, thus inducing periodic low-frequency Ca2+ oscillations that trigger transcriptional processes in mammalian cells. The present study was undertaken to delineate the mechanisms underlying the Ca2+ oscillations. Patch-clamp experiments were combined with single cell measurements of intracellular Ca2+ and with flowcytometric analyses. Application of HlyA at subcytocidal concentrations provoked Ca2+ oscillations in human renal and endothelial cells. However, contrary to the previous report, the phenomenon could not be inhibited by the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine and Ca2+ oscillations showed no constant periodicity at all. Ca2+ oscillations were dependent on the pore-forming activity of HlyA: application of a nonhemolytic but bindable toxin had no effect. Washout experiments revealed that Ca2+ oscillations could not be maintained in the absence of toxin in the medium. Analogously, propidium iodide flux into cells occurred in the presence of HlyA, but cells rapidly became impermeable toward the dye after toxin washout, indicating resealing or removal of the membrane lesions. Finally, patch-clamp experiments revealed temporal congruence between pore formation and Ca2+ influx. We conclude that the nonperiodic Ca2+ oscillations induced by HlyA are not due to deregulation of physiological Ca2+ channels but derive from pulsed influxes of Ca2+ as a consequence of formation and rapid closure of HlyA pores in mammalian cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2100164492,"Assembly and trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors are processes contingent upon interactions between intracellular chaperone systems and discrete determinants in the receptor proteins. Kainate receptor subunits, which form ionotropic glutamate receptors with diverse roles in the central nervous system, contain a variety of trafficking determinants that promote either membrane expression or intracellular sequestration. In this report, we identify the coatomer protein complex I (COPI) vesicle coat as a critical mechanism for retention of the kainate receptor subunit KA2 in the endoplasmic reticulum. COPI subunits immunoprecipitated with KA2 subunits from both cerebellum and COS-7 cells, and β-COP protein interacted directly with immobilized KA2 peptides containing the arginine-rich retention/retrieval determinant. Association between COPI proteins and KA2 subunits was significantly reduced upon alanine substitution of this signal in the cytoplasmic tail of KA2. Temperature-sensitive degradation of COPI complex proteins was correlated with an increase in plasma membrane localization of the homologous KA2 receptor. Assembly of heteromeric GluR6a/KA2 receptors markedly reduced association of KA2 and COPI. Finally, the reduction in COPI binding was correlated with an increased association with 14-3-3 proteins, which mediate forward trafficking of other integral signaling proteins.

Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 2Huettner J.E. Prog. Neurobiol. 2003; 70: 387-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These diverse physiological roles of KARs require selective assembly, subcellular trafficking, and targeting of these proteins to their functional sites. Elucidating the cellular mechanisms that control these processes is important for understanding the full spectrum of KAR-mediated signaling in the brain. Oligomerization and intracellular trafficking of KARs are controlled in part through interactions with chaperone proteins that bind to discrete cytoplasmic domains on the receptor proteins themselves. For example, GluR6a KAR subunits contain a forward trafficking determinant in their cytoplasmic tail and therefore are highly expressed as homomeric receptors on the plasma membrane of heterologous cell lines (3Yan S. Sanders J.M. Xu J. Zhu Y. Contractor A. Swanson G.T. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas the KA2 subunit has an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention/retrieval signal and consequently does not reach the plasma membrane in the absence of other KAR subunits (4Ren Z. Riley N.J. Garcia E.P. Sanders J.M. Swanson G.T. Marshall J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6608-6616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The KA2 ER retention/retrieval signal consists primarily of an arginine-rich domain similar to that characterized on several other ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits, including NR1 (5Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C. Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and GluR5-2c (6Jaskolski F. Coussen F. Nagarajan N. Normand E. Rosenmund C. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2506-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), as well as other signaling proteins such as ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) (7Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) and GABAB receptors (8Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Although a number of trafficking motifs in KAR subunits have been identified (9Jaskolski F. Coussen F. Mulle C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 20-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), little is known about how these trafficking signals control localization of receptors and which chaperone proteins are responsible for the modulation of receptor trafficking. Recently, arginine-based ER retention/retrieval motifs similar to that in the KA2 subunit were shown to comprise non-canonical binding sites for the coatomer protein complex I (COPI) in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α subunits (10Keller S.H. Lindstrom J. Ellisman M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18384-18391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), KCNK3 potassium channels (11O'Kelly I. Butler M.H.

Biol. 2003; 13: 638-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). COPI complexes consist of 7 distinct subunits (α, β, β′, γ, δ, ε, and ζ subunits) and play a central role in retrograde trafficking from the Golgi to the ER of misfolded, unassembled proteins and ER-resident proteins (13Lee M.C. Miller E.A. Goldberg J. Orci L. Schekman R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 87-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). In KCNK3 and Kir6.2 channels, COPI-mediated ER retention was opposed by 14-3-3 proteins, a family of soluble proteins with diverse cellular functions (11O'Kelly I. Butler M.H. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 12Yuan H. Michelsen K. Schwappach B. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 638-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins also promoted plasma membrane expression of other integral proteins such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (14Jeanclos E.M. Lin L. Treuil M.W. Rao J. DeCoster M.A. Anand R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28281-28290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and TASK-1 and TASK-3 potassium channels (15Rajan S. Preisig-Muller R. Wischmeyer E. Nehring R. Hanley P.J. Renigunta V. Musset B. Schlichthorl G. Derst C. Karschin A. Daut J. J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this project, we tested the hypothesis that the polyarginine trafficking determinant in KA2 KAR subunits functions as a COPI interaction domain and thereby mediates sequestration of these subunits in the ER. We found that COPI did indeed associate with KA2 subunits, and this interaction was reduced upon mutation of the arginine-rich ER retention/retrieval domain. As well, mutations that reduced COPI association concomitantly increased association with endogenous and exogenous 14-3-3ζ proteins. The strong correlation between plasma membrane expression of KA2 receptors and interactions with COPI and 14-3-3ζ proteins support our hypothesis that these chaperone systems regulate the subcellular trafficking of KA2 subunits.

Myc-GluR6(Q), myc-GluR5-2b, and myc-GluR5-2c were received from Dr. Christophe Mulle (Université Bordeaux II, France). VSVG-14-3-3ζ was a gift from Dr. Melanie Darstein. All cDNAs were in pcDNA3 vectors. Other cDNA mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All mutants were subcloned back into the wild type vector using an EcoRI-XbaI site for myc-KA2 cDNAs. PCR-amplified sequences including the site mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Cerebellar Lysate Preparation—Cerebella were dissected from 129SvEv wild type mice or KA2–/– mice at 21–25 days old, homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.32 m sucrose, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were centrifuged again at 180,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride-HCl, 0.8 μm aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 40 μm bestatin, 15 μm pepstatin A, and 14 μm l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Protein Preparation—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at 1 × 106 cells and transfected with a total of 5 μg of cDNA using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer. Crude protein lysates were obtained after centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Wild type CHO and mutant CHO(ldlF) (clone 2) cells were a gift from Dr. Richard Anderson (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and Dr. Monty Krieger (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA), and were maintained as described in Guo et al. (16Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were transferred to 39.5 °C for 12 h before biochemical analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitations were performed by first incubating membrane preparations with 50 μl of either 50% protein A/G-Sepharose slurry (20422, Pierce), for COS-7 cell lysate, or TrueBlot anti-rabbit Ig IP beads (00-8800, eBioscience, San Diego, CA), for cerebellar preparations, overnight at 4 °C to eliminate nonspecific binding (“preclear” step). Preclear supernatants were incubated with 4 μg of anti-KA2 (06-315, Upstate Biotechnology, Waltham, MA), anti-GluR6/7 (06-309, Upstate Biotechnology), anti-β-COP (PA1–061, Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), anti-α-COP (PA1–067, Affinity BioReagents), anti-14-3-3β (K-19, sc-629, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-14-3-3γ (C-16, sc-731, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-14-3-3ζ (C-16, sc-1019, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-VSV glycoprotein antibody (clone P5D4, V5507, Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by the incubation with 50 μl of either 50% protein A/G-Sepharose beads or TrueBlot anti-rabbit Ig IP beads at 4 °C overnight. After five washes in lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted from beads by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) for 5 min and then separated by electrophoresis on 8% SDS-PAGE gels. 2 μg of COS-7 proteins and 10 μg of cerebellar proteins were loaded into the lysate lane. Proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-β-COP (1:2000), anti-KA2 (1 μg/ml), anti-GluR6/7 (1 μg/ml), anti-myc (0.4 μg/ml, clone 9E10, Roche Applied Science), anti-GFP (1:500, 8,371, JL-8, BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA), anti-14-3-3β (1:3,000, H-8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-14-3-3ζ (1:10000), or anti-VSVG antibody (1:200,000). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000, NA931V, Amersham Biosciences), HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000, NA934V, Amersham Biosciences), or HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG TrueBlot (1:2000, 88-1688, eBioscience). The density of bands was quantitated using an AlphaImager machine (model 5500, AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA) and Chemilmager program (AlphaInnotech). Quantitation of protein densities on Western blots was carried out by normalizing the immunoprecipitated band density to that of the lysate band (which was proportional to the expression levels of the protein). For each experiment, the density of the background preclear band was subtracted from the immunoprecipitate band density, and this value was divided by the density of the lysate band. The lysate lane in every Western blot was loaded with 2 μg, allowing us to compare density ratios between experiments. All experiments were performed at least three times. Statistical analyses were performed on the normalized values. Immunolocalization of Receptors and Confocal Microscopy—Transfected COS-7 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were incubated with anti-myc antibody (4 μg/ml in 10% goat serum) at room temperature for 2 h. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS and subsequently incubated with anti-β-COP antibody (1:500 in 10% goat serum) at room temperature for 2 h. After 3 washes, cells were incubated with appropriate fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at room temperature for 1 h. All images were taken from a inverted LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope at the Optical Imaging Laboratory using a Plan-Apochromat ×63/1.4 oil objective lens with excitation wavelength at 480 nm for Alexa Fluor 488 and at 543 nm for Alexa Fluor 594. Peptide-binding Assay—Two peptides containing the KA2 cytoplasmic arginine-rich trafficking determinant and the associated alanine mutant were synthesized with amide terminal groups (KA2-Rpep, CRKTSRSRRRRRP; KA2-Apep, CRKTSRSAAAAAP). These were linked to Sepharose beads at the initial cysteine residue (21st Century Biochemicals, Malboro, MA). Peptide beads were incubated with COS-7 cell lysate overnight. After five washes in lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted and separated as described in the immunoblotting section. Band densities in Western blots were normalized to total β-COP expression in lysate. Experiments were performed four times. Cell Surface Biotinylation Assay—COS-7 cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with 1 μg of cDNA. CHO cells were plated into 100-mm dishes and transfected with 5 μg of cDNA. Transfected cells were washed twice with cold PBS and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml EZ-link sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (21331, Pierce) in PBS, pH 8.0, at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation. Non-reacted biotin was quenched using quenching solution (50 mm glycine in PBS, pH 8.0) 3 times and then cells were washed 3 times with cold TBS (0.025 m Tris and 0.15 m NaCl), pH 7.2. Cells were harvested in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were incubated with 50 μl of 50% streptavidin-Sepharose high performance beads (17-5113-01, Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed four times, and proteins were eluted and detected as co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In the experiments with CHO cells, the “total” lane was loaded with lysate equivalent to 1% of the protein loaded on the peptide-linked beads. Biotinylated proteins eluted from the beads (corresponding to subunits located in the plasma membrane) were normalized to total protein expression and reported in the term of percentage. All experiments were performed at least four times. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—COS-7 cells were inoculated at 4.5 × 104 cells and transfected with 0.6 μg of cDNA using FuGENE 6 reagent in 12-well plates. After 48 h, cells were washed once with cold PBS and incubated with anti-myc antibody (4 μg/ml in 10% goat serum) at 4 °C for 30 min to detect plasma membrane expression. Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min. For measuring total protein expression, cells were first fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and incubated with anti-myc antibody at room temperature for 2 h. Both groups were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000 in 10% goat serum, NA931V, Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature for 1 h. After the third washing with PBS, the HRP substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (P9187, Sigma) was added and the color reaction was developed for 1 h. The optical density of 0.2 ml of supernatant was detected by spectrophotometer at 490 nm. All values were an average of four replicates in each experiment; the mean background absorbance of the negative controls (sham-transfected cells) were subtracted from surface and total absorbance values. Data are presented in the form of a ratio of plasma membrane expression to total cellular expression. At least four experiments were performed with each cDNA. Statistical Analysis—Data were tested with a one-way analysis of variance and the post-hoc Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test, or a one-tailed paired Student's t test. Immunoprecipitation of KA2 and COPI Proteins—The COPI chaperone complex was shown recently to be a critical mediator of ER retrieval mediated by polyarginine signals in a subset of integral membrane proteins (11O'Kelly I. Butler M.H. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 12Yuan H. Michelsen K. Schwappach B. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 638-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Jeanclos E.M. Lin L. Treuil M.W. Rao J. DeCoster M.A. Anand R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28281-28290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The KA2 kainate receptor subunit is retained efficiently in the ER through a mechanism primarily mediated by a polyarginine signal in the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain. To determine whether COPI proteins subserve a retention/retrieval function for the KA2 kainate receptor subunit, we first tested for a biochemical interaction between KA2 subunits and members of the COPI complex in transfected COS-7 cells. NH2-terminal myc-tagged recombinant rat KA2, GluR5-2b, GluR5-2c, or GluR6a cDNAs were transfected into COS-7 cells before immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with an anti-β-COP antibody; KA2 or other subunit protein was then detected in Western immunoblots using an anti-myc antibody. We found that homomeric myc-KA2 receptors co-precipitated with endogenous β-COP in either COS-7 cells (IP lane, Fig. 1A) or in transfected HEK293 cells (data not shown). The PC lane in Fig. 1 showed the nonspecific binding of protein to the beads used for immunoprecipitation. In contrast to KA2, myc-GluR5-2b, myc-GluR5-2c, and myc-GluR6a subunits did not co-immunoprecipitate with β-COP (Fig. 1A), demonstrating that the interaction is relatively specific to KA2 subunits. We also tried the converse experiment, immunoprecipitation of myc-KA2 and immunoblotting for β-COP protein, and observed a very weak but detectable coprecipitation (Fig. 1B). We postulate from these data that the majority of KA2 subunits are resident in the ER and that a relatively small proportion of the receptor subunit transiently associates with COPI during retrieval to the ER. We next tested if the interaction between KA2 subunits and COPI complex proteins could be detected in the central nervous system. The KA2 subunit is highly expressed in cerebellar granule cells, where they likely form heteromeric receptors with GluR6 subunits and modulate excitatory synaptic transmission at parallel fiber synapses (17Delaney A.J. Jahr C.E. Neuron. 2002; 36: 475-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Membrane protein lysates were prepared from homogenized cerebella from 129SvEv mice as well as KA2–/– gene-targeted mice (as a control for nonspecific interactions with the precipitating antibody). KA2 protein was immunoprecipitated from the lysates with an anti-KA2 antibody and β-COP was detected in Western blots (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1, β-COP subunit co-immunoprecipitated with KA2 protein from wild type but not KA2–/– cerebella (Fig. 1C, left panels). Blots were stripped and re-probed with anti-KA2 antibody to verify that the immunoprecipitation of KA2 subunit protein was successful (Fig. 1C, right panel), and as expected immunoreactivity was not detected in the samples from KA2–/– mice. A reciprocal immunoprecipitation using an anti-β-COP antibody also supported a robust association between the KA2 subunit and β-COP (Fig. 1D). Because cerebellar KA2 subunits likely assemble with GluR6 subunits as heteromeric receptors, we also tested to see if β-COP co-precipitated GluR6 either directly or in association with KA2. As shown in Fig. 1D, GluR6/7 immunoreactivity did not precipitate with β-COP. In the reciprocal experiment, we immunoprecipitated GluR6/7 protein and Western blotted for β-COP. The vesicle protein was not detected in this assay (Fig. 1E). These results support the interpretation that KA2 subunits exist in at least two distinct pools in cerebellum: those assembled with GluR6 as heteromeric KARs and those associated with the COPI retrograde trafficking pathway fated for retrieval to the ER. Subcellular Co-localization of KA2 and β-COP—Next, we determined if the subcellular localizations of KA2 subunits and COPI proteins were consistent with their interaction in our biochemical assays using confocal immunofluorescence staining of transfected COS-7 cells. Myc-KA2 subunits were detected with an anti-myc antibody (red in Fig. 1F) and β-COP was stained with an anti-β-COP antibody (green in Fig. 1F). In addition to COPI vesicle staining, anti-β-COP antibody strongly labels the Golgi apparatus, which is manifested as the intense green labeling in the image. The vast majority of KA2 receptor subunits are located in the ER and are unlikely to be actively associated with COPI, accounting for very weak β-COP bands when the KA2 subunit is the target of immunoprecipitation. As shown in the last row of images in Fig. 1F, the discrete vesicle-like structures (punctate dots) positively stained for both KA2 and β-COP likely represent COPI vesicles containing KA2 as cargo protein. Elimination of COPI Function Promotes Plasma Expression of KA2 Receptors—If COPI association plays a central role in limiting forward trafficking of KA2 subunits beyond the cis-Golgi, homomeric KA2 receptors should exhibit higher plasma membrane expression when COPI functionality is disrupted. CHO(ldlF) cells contain a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation in one subunit of the complex, ε-COP (16Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). At a nonpermissive temperature (39.5 °C), ε-COP is degraded and the cells lose the capability of forming COPI vesicle coats. We compared the plasma membrane expression of homomeric myc-KA2 receptors expressed in wild type CHO cells and CHO(ldlF) cells using a cell surface biotinylation assay (Fig. 2A). Cell surface proteins were labeled with biotin, purified on streptavidin columns, and eluted proteins were immunoblotted with anti-myc antibody. We included lanes with 1% of the input myc-KA2 protein to determine the relative amount of KA2 expressed at the plasma membrane, and detected actin immunoreactivity to verify equivalent protein loading (Fig. 2A). The relative plasma membrane to total protein expression of myc-KA2 receptors in CHO(ldlF) cells increased significantly by 3.6-fold (n = 4, p < 0.05) after a 12-h incubation at 39.5 °C compared with CHO(ldlF) cells kept at 34 °C for the same period of time (Fig. 2B). Transfected CHO cells kept at either 37 or 39.5 °C expressed the same relative level of myc-KA2 on the plasma membrane as CHO(ldlF) cells maintained at the permissive temperature. This data support the hypothesis that COPI-mediated retention/retrieval prevents plasma membrane expression KA2 receptors. Dependence of COPI Association on the KA2 Trafficking Determinant—We hypothesized that COPI proteins interacted with KA2 subunits at the arginine-rich domain in the intracellular carboxyl terminus. To determine whether the critical amino acid residues responsible for COPI association site correlated with those required for ER sequestration, we examined COPI association with truncated and alanine-substituted KA2 subunits generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the receptor cDNA. The cytoplasmic tail of KA2 contains 155 amino acids; we generated a mutant subunit truncated at residue 827 (827-stop, with our numbering beginning at the initial methionine), which eliminated the bulk of the COOH terminus, and 856-stop, which terminated the cytoplasmic tail prior to the polyarginine domain (Fig. 3A). Truncated myc-KA2(827-stop) and myc-KA2(856-stop) subunits expressed in COS-7 cells exhibited significantly decreased association with β-COP in immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 3B). Quantification of the optical density of the immunoprecipitated bands relative to that of their respective lysate bands revealed that the interaction between the truncated KA2 subunits and β-COP was reduced by 71 ± 9 and 78 ± 3% (n = 3, p < 0.01) for myc-KA2(827-stop) and myc-KA2(856-stop), respectively (Fig. 3C). These data indicated that the majority of β-COP association with KA2 subunits depended on domains downstream from the 856-stop site, consistent with the proposal that the polyarginine trafficking domain comprised a putative site for interaction. In addition to the polyarginine site, a pair of COOH-terminal leucine residues were shown to influence cell surface expression (4Ren Z. Riley N.J. Garcia E.P. Sanders J.M. Swanson G.T. Marshall J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6608-6616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore also were considered as a candidate interaction site. Alanine substitution of all five arginines, in the mutant construct myc-KA2(R862–6A), or both cytoplasmic trafficking determinants, in myc-KA2(R862–6A,L908–9V), markedly decreased the association of KA2 subunits with β-COP (by 59 ± 11 and 67 ± 6%, n = 6 and 3, respectively, p < 0.01) to a level similar to that observed for the truncated KA2 subunits (Fig. 3, B and C). To further define the COPI binding site, we tested the interaction of β-COPI with two KA2 mutants in which the polyarginine determinant was substituted with two sets of three alanines: myc-KA2(R862–4A) and myc-KA2(R864–6A). Association of β-COP protein with either of these mutants was not reduced from that of wild type KA2 subunits (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that all five arginine residues (or a different subset of residues) in KA2 are necessary for interaction with the chaperone system. All blots were stripped and re-probed with an anti-β-COP antibody to verify the efficiency of COPI immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3B). β-COP is one of seven proteins that comprise the COPI chaperone system; to further validate the association between KA2 subunits and the COPI complex we tested for association between the receptor subunit and α-COP, another component of COPI vesicle coats. Immunoprecipitation of KA2-transfected cells with α-COPI antibody resulted in co-precipitation of KA2 protein (Fig. 4A). As with β-COP, the truncation of receptor (myc-KA2(856-stop)) and mutation of the polyarginine motif (myc-KA2(R862–6A)) markedly reduced association with α-COP (by 88 ± 4 and 66 ± 15%, n = 3, respectively, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4, A and B). These results further support our hypothesis that the arginine-rich domain plays a role in COPI association. Interaction between β-COP and Peptides Containing the KA2 Trafficking Determinant—We next tested if the association inferred from our immunoprecipitations likely resulted from a direct interaction between COPI proteins and the polyarginine domain in the KA2 subunit. This was tested by comparing the binding of β-COP protein in COS-7 cell lysates to two short peptides, KA2-Rpep and KA2-Apep, which were conjugated to Sepharose beads (Fig. 5A). KA2-Rpep contained the KA2 cytoplasmic arginine-rich trafficking determinant, whereas KA2-Apep had the five alanine substitutions used in previous immunoprecipitation experiments. The Lysate lane in the Fig. 5 shows expression of the β-COP protein in the COS-7 lysate, and the NS lane shows the nonspecific intera"

In situ hybridization revealed a periodicity for amelogenin mRNA hybridization signals ranging from low to high transcript abundance on serial sections of developing mouse teeth. This in vivo observation led us to examine the amelogenin promoter for the activity of transcription factor(s) that account for this expression aspect of the regulation for the amelogenin gene. We have previously shown that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) is a potent transactivator of the mouse X-chromosomal amelogenin gene acting at the C/EBPα cis-element located in the –70/+52 minimal promoter. The minimal promoter contains a reversed CCAAT box (–58/–54) that is four base pairs downstream from the C/EBPα binding site. Similar to the C/EBPα binding site, the integrity of the reversed CCAAT box is also required for maintaining the activity of the basal promoter. We therefore focused on transcription factors that interact with the reversed CCAAT box. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays we demonstrated that NF-Y was directly bound to this reversed CCAAT site. Co-transfection of C/EBPα and NF-Y synergistically increased the promoter activity. In contrast, increased expression of NF-Y alone had only marginal effects on the promoter. A dominant-negative DNA binding-deficient NF-Y mutant (NF-YAm29) dramatically decreased the promoter activity both in the absence or presence of exogenous expression of C/EBPα. We identified protein-protein interactions between C/EBPα and NF-Y by a co-immunoprecipitation analysis. These results suggest that C/EBPα and NF-Y synergistically activate the mouse amelogenin gene and can contribute to its physiological regulation during amelogenesis.

Tooth organogenesis is a complex developmental process that is dependent upon a series of reciprocal and instructive signals (1Jernvall J. Thesleff I. Mech.

Amelogenin plays a key role in regulating proper enamel mineralization and is believed to regulate its own replacement by the mineral phase to create a woven hierarchical architecture that accounts for the unique material properties of enamel (2Gibson C.W.

Deletion analysis of this 2,263-nucleotide stretch demonstrates that the –70/+52-bp minimal promoter is indispensable for maintaining transcriptional activity. In addition, this minimal promoter contains a CCAAT/enhancer-binding site that is required for both basal promoter activity and C/EBPα-mediated transactivation (9Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol.

Sequence analysis of the amelogenin minimal promoter (–70/+52) also revealed a reversed CCAAT box located in the –58/–54 region, four base pairs downstream to the C/EBPα binding site.

Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Among these transcription factors, NF-Y was regarded as a leading candidate based on the following. First, of all the potential CCAAT-binding proteins, only NF-Y has been shown to be absolutely required for all CCAAT pentanucleotide bona fide sequences (33Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 34Hatamochi A. Golumbek P.T. Van Schaftingen E. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7265-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Second, several lines of evidence indicate that NF-Y cooperatively interacts with C/EBPα to function in transcriptional regulation on a variety of promoters (37Milos P.M. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 38Park S.K. Oh S.Y. Lee M.Y. Yoon S. Kim K.S. Kim J.W.

Chem. 2004; 279: 29902-29910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). NF-Y is a heterotrimeric protein consisting of three subunits, NF-YA (also termed CCAAT binding factor B (CBF-B)), NF-YB (CBF-A), and NF-YC (CBF-C). Alignment of amino acid sequences of these three subunits reveals several highly conserved regions. NF-YA has a glutamine-rich region, a serine/threonine-rich region, a subunit interaction domain, and a DNA-binding domain. NF-YB contains a histone fold motif and a TATA-binding protein (TBP)-binding domain. Similar to NF-YB, NF-YC bears a histone fold motif, a TBP-binding domain, and an additional glutamine-rich region (40Matuoka K. Yu Chen K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All three subunits are necessary for DNA binding. The two subunits NF-YB and NF-YC first form a heterodimer via their histone fold motifs. The dimer then provides a suitable docking site for NF-YA to bind to form a functionally active NF-Y heterotrimeric protein (41Matuoka K. Chen K.Y. Ageing Res. Rev. 2002; 1: 639-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that NF-Y is directly bound to the –58/–54-bp CCAAT box within the amelogenin promoter. Moreover, NF-Y and C/EBPα synergistically increase the minimal amelogenin promoter activity, although NF-Y alone has only marginal effects on the promoter. We also identified protein-protein interactions between NF-Y and C/EBPα. Finally, ameloblasts from developing mouse teeth in vivo express both C/EBPα and NF-YA during development at a stage corresponding to maximum amelogenin expression. Taken together, these results suggest that NF-Y and C/EBPα synergistically activate the mouse amelogenin gene and could contribute to the physiologic regulation of amelogenin expression during enamel formation in vivo. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was used to determine the precise spatial distribution for amelogenin mRNA from lower incisors. An antisense amelogenin RNA probe was labeled by synthesis in the presence of [35S]thiophosphate-UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to specific activity of ∼5 × 108 cpm/μg of RNA. The in situ hybridization method has been previously published and used without modification (7Snead M.L. Luo W. Lau E.C. Slavkin H.C. Development. 1988; 104: 77-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Chicken Anti-C/EBPα Antibody—A C/EBPα internal epitope peptide (amino acids 249–263) was synthesized at the Microchemical Core Facility (University of Southern California Microchemical Core Facility) and used to generate chicken polyclonal antibodies that were purified from the yolk by affinity chromatography to the immobilized peptide. Immunohistochemistry—Immunostaining was performed according to Couwenhoven et al. (42Couwenhoven R.I. Luo W. Snead M.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1853-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), using an anti-C/EBPα chicken polyclonal antibody (1:200; Invitrogen) or a commercially available polyclonal antibody to NF-YA (1:200, sc-10779; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), followed by appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500; Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). A substrate-chromogen mixture (Zymed Laboratories) was used for signal detection. Plasmids and Cell Culture—The reporter constructs of p70-luc, mC/EBPα-p70-luc, and p51-luc were prepared as previously described (9Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To generate mp70-luc and mC/EBPα-mp70-luc, the promoter regions were prepared by polymerase chain reactions with p70-luc as the template using a common 3′-primer (5′-TATTCTCGAGTGTATGCTCAGTGAG-3′; the XhoI site is underlined) and respective 5′-primers (5′-CGTGCTAGCTCAGAAACCTGATCAGCTGTTCAAA-3′; and 5′-CGTGCTAGCTTCAGTCTAGAGATCAGCTGTTCAAA-3′; the NheI sites are underlined and the mutated site is in boldface). The PCR products were digested with NheI and XhoI and inserted 5′ to 3′ into the NheI-XhoI site of pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) and verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. The expression vector for C/EBPα was described previously (43Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Hemati N. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8433-8441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vectors for three subunits of NF-Y (NF-YA, NF-YB, NF-YC) (44Taira T. Sawai M. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24270-24279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. Hiroyoshi Ariga (Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan). The dominant-negative NF-YA expression vector (NF-YAm29) (45Mantovani R. Li X.Y. Pessara U. Hooft van Huisjduijnen R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. Timothy Osborne (University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA). A mouse ameloblast-like cell line LS8 was maintained as previously described (9Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Variable amounts of plasmid DNA were used for transient transfection for each well of 12-well plates. The amounts of DNA varied based upon experimental conditions and are documented in the figure legends. To normalize transfection efficiency, 75 ng of pCMV-lacZ/well was co-transfected as an internal control. The day before transfection, LS8 cells were plated in 12-well plates so that they were 50–80% confluent at the time of transfection. At the time of plating and during transfection, antibiotics were avoided. Three hours before transfection, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and subsequently cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Plasmid DNA (0.75 μg) was diluted into 62 μl of medium in a 5-ml Falcon culture tube, and 5 μl of Plus reagent (Invitrogen) was added, mixed, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. In a second tube, 2.5 μl of Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) was diluted into 62 μl of medium and mixed. The contents of these two tubes were combined, mixed, and incubated for another 15 min at room temperature. While complexes were forming, the medium on the cells was replaced with 0.5 ml of fresh medium. The DNA-Plus-Lipofectamine complex was added to each well of cells and mixed gently. The cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After removal of the medium containing DNA-Plus-Lipofectamine complex, cells were incubated in 1 ml of fresh complete medium for an additional 22 h and were subjected to luciferase assay with a Dual-Light kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Cell scrapers (Corning Inc., Acton, MA) were used to detach cells from the plate. Cell lysates were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at maximum speed for 2 min. The extracts (supernatant) were transferred to a fresh tube and stored at –70 °C. At the time of chemiluminescent detection, buffers A and B (Applied Biosystems) were equilibrated to room temperature, and Galacton-Plus Substrate was added to buffer B at the ratio 1:100. A 10-μl aliquot of cell extracts was transferred to a luminometer tube in which 25 μl of buffer A was added, immediately followed by the addition of 100 μl of buffer B. After a 15-s delay, the luciferase signal was obtained for 5 s in a luminometer (Lumat, Berthold, ND). After 45 min of incubation at room temperature, 100 μl of Accelerator-II was added, and β-galactosidase signal was measured for 5 s in the same luminometer. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—LS8 cells (100-mm plates) were transiently transfected with 10 μg of C/EBPα expression vector by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. Briefly, 10 μg of DNA was mixed with 62 μl of 2 m CaCl2, diluted to 500 μl with double distilled H2O, and added dropwise to the 37 °C prewarmed 2× HBS (HEPES-buffered saline) solution. After standing for 20 min at room temperature, the DNA-calcium phosphate co-precipitates were added dropwise to the surface of the medium covering the cells and incubated overnight. The next day, medium containing the calcium phosphate was removed and replaced with fresh complete medium for an additional 24 h. LS8 cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and scraped off in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μl/ml of aprotinin (Sigma), 5 μg/ml of leupeptin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Cell lysates were Dounce homogenized for 15 strokes with a type A pestle on ice, transferred to a 1.5-ml tube, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μlof cold extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl, 5 μl/ml of aprotinin (Sigma), 5 μg/ml of leupeptin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 420 mm NaCl) and mixed on a rotator for 1 h at 4 °C. Nuclear debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing the nuclear extracts were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The oligodeoxynucleotide probes were synthesized, annealed, and radiolabeled with α-32P (PerkinElmer) using the fill-in reaction and Klenow enzyme (Roche Applied Science). A mass of 8–15 μg of nuclear extract was added from selected samples in the EMSA buffer at the final concentration of 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 12 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.2 μg/μl of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides (∼3,000–6,000 cpm/fmol) in 1.5-μl volume were added and incubated for an additional 1 h at room temperature. Where indicated, 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor probes, antibodies (1 μg for anti-NF-Y, and 2 μg for anti-C/EBPα, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or normal serum was included in the binding reaction prior to the addition of radiolabeled probes. After mixing with 1 μl of loading buffer containing 250 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 0.2% xylene cyanol, and 40% glycerol, the mixture was resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer prerun at 20 mA for at least 30 min. Gel electrophoresis was carried out at 30 mA for 2.5 h. The gel was dried, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. The sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows: wild-type (WT) sense strand, 5′-TTTTTCATTCAGAAACCTGATTGGCTGTTC-3′; wild-type (WT) antisense strand, 5′-GAACAGCCAATCAGGTTTCTGAATG-3′; mutant C/EBPα (mC/EBPα) sense strand, 5′-TTTTTCATTCAGTCTAGAGATTGGCTGTTC-3′; mutant C/EBPα antisense strand, 5′-GAACAGCCAA TCTCTAGACTGAATG-3′; mutant NF-Y (mNF-Y) sense strand, 5′-TTTTTCATTCAGAAACCTGATCAGCTGTTC-3′; mutant NF-Y antisense strand, 5′-GAACAGCTGATCAGGTTTCTGAATG-3′; mutant C/EBPα-mutant NF-Y (mC/EBPα-mNF-Y) sense strand, 5′-TTTTTCATTCAGTCTAGAGATCAGCTGTTC-3′; mutant C/EBPα-mutant NF-Y antisense strand, 5′-GAACAGCTGATCTCTAGACTGAATG-3′ (mutated nucleotides are in boldface). Co-immunoprecipitation Assay and Western Blotting—LS8 cells, ∼90% confluent in a 100-mm cell culture plate, were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (1 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μl/ml of aprotinin (Sigma), and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) was added, and the cells were collected using a cell scraper (Corning Inc.) and lysed by passing six times through a 22-gauge needle at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the protein concentration of the supernatant was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as standards. For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of total protein was precleaned with 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Sigma) prior to the addition of 2 μg of primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for overnight incubation at 4 °C with rotation. Protein G-agarose beads (20 μl; IgG binding capacity at 10–20 μg/μl) were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. After the final wash, the pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and stored at –70 °C. Samples were resolved by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). The membranes were incubated in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with the primary antibody for 1 h and the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Protein-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Amelogenin mRNA Abundance in Mouse Mandibular Incisors—In situ hybridization studies have previously demonstrated that amelogenin mRNA level is regulated in a spatial- and temporal-restricted pattern during mouse molar tooth organogenesis (7Snead M.L. Luo W. Lau E.C. Slavkin H.C. Development. 1988; 104: 77-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have investigated the expression pattern of mouse amelogenin mRNA in lower incisors. In situ hybridization data revealed a periodicity for amelogenin mRNA by ameloblasts, ranging from low (Fig. 1A) to high (Fig. 1D) transcript abundance on serial sagittal sections of developing mouse incisors. This finding from mouse incisors, combined with our previous observation from mouse molars (7Snead M.L. Luo W. Lau E.C. Slavkin H.C. Development. 1988; 104: 77-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that amelogenin expression levels are tightly regulated at the temporal and spatial level in vivo to accommodate the process of enamel biomineralization (5Paine M.L. White S.N. Luo W. Fong H. Sarikaya M. Snead M.L. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 273-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical Localization of C/EBPα and NF-YA in Mouse Mandibular Incisors—We have previously identified C/EBPα as a transactivator of amelogenin gene in vitro (9Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To investigate the relationship of C/EBPα to amelogenin expression in vivo, we performed immunohistochemistry to detect C/EBPα. Consistent with the amelogenin mRNA hybridization signal pattern, immunohistochemistry for C/EBPα protein revealed a repeating periodicity for C/EBPα with subcellular localization to either the cytoplasm or the nucleus of ameloblast cells in the mandibular incisors (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, the anti-NF-YA antibody localized to the nucleus of ameloblasts from mandibular incisors (Fig. 2, C and D). The pattern for amelogenin mRNA abundance and C/EBPα/NF-YA localization within ameloblasts suggested to us a potential role for C/EBPα/NF-Y in the regulation of amelogenin gene expression in vivo. We pursued the role for these transcription factors to regulate the amelogenin promoter in vitro using an ameloblast-like cell line, LS8. The Minimal Amelogenin Promoter Activity Is Dependent on Both the –70/–63-bp C/EBPα Cis-element and the –58/–54-bp CCAAT Box—Deletion analysis of the mouse amelogenin promoter has shown that the –70/+51-bp region functions as a minimal promoter in LS8 cells (9Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A C/EBPα cis-element is identified in the –70/–63 bp, and it is through this region that C/EBPα up-regulates the promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (9Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the –80/–40 bp of X-chromosomal amelogenin gene from mouse, pig, bovine, horse, monkey, and human revealed a highly conserved reversed CCAAT box located in the –58/–54-bp region (Fig. 3A). All sequences showed a match for the pentanucleotides of ATTGG, a reversed CCAAT box. To investigate the potential role of this cis-element in the regulation of amelogenin promoter, the ATTGG sequence in the p70-luc reporter construct was mutated to ATCAG to generate the “mp70-luc” construct (Fig. 3B). Transient transfection of mp70-luc into LS8 cells, compared with that of p70-luc, showed a complete loss of basal promoter activity (Fig. 3C, lane 2). This suggested an important role for the CCAAT box in maintaining the activity of the basal amelogenin promoter. Sequence alignment also revealed that the C/EBPα binding site was close to the CCAAT box, just four base pairs upstream to the CCAAT box (Fig. 3A). To further understand the role of the C/EBPα binding site and the CCAAT box in regulating the amelogenin promoter and their potential relationship with each other, a series of mutation constructs were generated as shown in Fig. 3B. Each of these mutation constructs, mC/EBPα-p70-luc (mutated C/EBPα site), mp70-luc (mutated CCAAT site), mC/EBPα-mp70-luc (mutated C/EBPα site and mutated CCAAT site), and p51-luc (deleted C/EBPα and deleted CCAAT sites) or their wild-type counterpart, was co-transfected into LS8 cells with or without the C/EBPα expression vector and analyzed in transient transfection assays. The mutation of the C/EBPα cis-element (mC/EBPα-p70-luc), CCAAT box (mp70-luc), dual mutations (mC/EBPα-mp70-luc), as well as the dual deleted C/EBPα and CCAAT box construct (p51-luc), all showed a complete loss of the basal promoter activity (Fig. 3C, lanes 2–5). Furthermore, in response to the exogenous expression"

A., König, H., Thomm, M., Woese, C. R., Sleytr, U. B., and Stetter, K. O. (1986) Arch. Microbiol. 144, 324–333). To assess the possible involvement of the MurE activity in the incorporation of d-lysine, the murE gene from this organism was cloned in Escherichia coli, and the corresponding protein was purified as the C-terminal His6-tagged form. In vitro assays showed that d-lysine and meso-diaminopimelic acid were added to UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-dipeptide with 25 and 10% efficiencies, respectively, relative to l-lysine. The purified enzyme was used to synthesize the l- and d-lysine-containing UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptides; chemical analysis revealed an unusual structure for the d-lysine-containing nucleotide, namely acylation of the ε-amino function of d-lysine by the d-glutamyl residue. In vitro assays with MurF and MraY enzymes from T. maritima showed that this novel nucleotide was not a substrate for MurF but that it could be directly processed into tripeptide lipid I by MraY, thereby substantiating the role of MurE in the incorporation of d-lysine into peptidoglycan.

Peptidoglycan is a giant macromolecule composed of alternating N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramyl residues cross-linked by short peptides. Its biosynthesis is a complex two-stage process. The first stage consists of the formation of the disaccharide-pentapeptide monomer unit, whereas the second stage concerns the polymerization reactions (1van Heijenoort J. Nat. Prod.

The assembly of the peptide part of the monomer unit is ensured by a series of enzymes (MurC, MurD, MurE, and MurF) called the Mur synthetases. It has been shown that the Mur synthetases constitute a family of enzymes with common mechanistic and structural features (2Eveland S.S. Pompliano D.L. Anderson M.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6223-6229Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Parquet C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11556-11563Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Synthetase MurE catalyzes the addition of the third amino acid residue of the peptide chain. This residue, generally a diamino acid, varies among the bacterial species: meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-A2pm) 3The abbreviations used are: A2pm, 2,6-diaminopimelic acid; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenyl;MurNAc, N-acetylmuramoyl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. for most Gram-negative bacteria and bacilli, l-lysine for most Gram-positive bacteria, l-ornithine, meso-lanthionine, ll-A2pm, l-diaminobutyric acid, l-homoserine, etc. in particular species (4Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In many organisms, the third residue is involved in the cross-linking of the macromolecule; in those cases, the incorporation by MurE of a “wrong” amino acid results in cell lysis (5Mengin-Lecreulx D. Falla T. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Adams D.J. Chopra I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5909-5914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, MurE must be endowed with a high specificity to select the “right” amino acid among closely related amino acids that coexist within the cell. Recently, the crystallization of MurE from Escherichia coli allowed Gordon et al. (6Gordon E. Flouret B. Chantalat L. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Dideberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10999-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) to decipher the structural bases for this high specificity. Thermotoga maritima is a Gram-negative, extremely thermophilic bacterium isolated from geothermally heated sea floors (7Huber R. Langworthy T.A. König H. Thomm M. Woese C.R. Sleytr U.B. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 324-333Crossref Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The analysis of its peptidoglycan revealed the absence of A2pm and the presence of both enantiomers of lysine. In this paper, we describe the properties of purified MurE from this bacterial species; in particular, we demonstrate that it is capable of adding l- and d-lysine to UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl (MurNAc)-l-Ala-d-Glu with comparable efficiencies but in different ways. The explanation of this finding in terms of known consensus sequences in MurE proteins is discussed. Moreover, we bring evidences of its physiological relevance by showing that: (i) the novel d-lysine-containing nucleotide is a substrate for MraY from T. maritima in vitro and (ii) the overexpression of T. maritima murE in E. coli results in important lysine incorporation into the peptidoglycan of the host. Materials—DNA restriction enzymes and synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from New England Biolabs and MWG-Biotech, respectively. Vector pET2160 was constructed from pET21d (Novagen) according to Caravano et al. (8Caravano A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Brondello J.-M. Vincent S.P. Sinaÿ P. Chem. Eur.

Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were prepared according to the published procedures. l-Lysine and d-lysine were purchased from Fluka; their enantiomeric purity was confirmed by the measurement of their optical rotation and by amino acid analysis after reaction with l-lysine decarboxylase. N ε-Dinitrophenyl (DNP)-l-lysine was purchased from Sigma; Nα-DNP-l-lysine was obtained by trifluoroacetic acid treatment of Nα-DNP, N ε-t-butyloxycarbonyl-l-lysine, itself synthesized by dinitrophenylation of N ε-t-butyloxycarbonyl-l-lysine. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—E. coli strains BL21(DE3)/pLysS (Novagen) and DH5α (Invitrogen) were used as hosts for the plasmids as well as for the overproduction of the MurE and MurF enzymes. The murE thermosensitive strain PC2336 was obtained from the Phabagen collection (Department of Molecular Cell Biology, State University of Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands), and its complementation by plasmids was tested as described previously (16Mengin-Lecreulx D. Parquet C. Desviat L.R. Plá J. Flouret B. Ayala J. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6126-6134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2YT medium (17Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) was used for growing cells, and growth was monitored at 600 nm with a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. The antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml). General DNA Techniques and E. coli Cell Transformation—Polymerase chain reaction amplification of DNA was performed in a Thermocycler 60 apparatus (Bio-med) using an Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science); DNA fragments were purified using the Wizard purification system. Plasmid isolations were carried out using the Nucleospin® plasmid extraction system (Macherey-Nagel). Standard procedures were used for endonuclease digestions, ligation, and agarose electrophoresis (18Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980Google Scholar, 19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli cells were made competent and transformed with plasmid DNA using the method of Dagert and Ehrlich (20Dagert M. Ehrlich S.D. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 6: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Cloning of the T. maritima murE Gene and Plasmid Construction—Standard procedures for molecular cloning were used (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The T. maritima murE gene was amplified by PCR from the chromosome of strain MSB8; for this purpose, two primers containing a BspHI site (shown in bold type) 5′ to the initiation codon (underlined), 5′-TCTATCATGAATATATCAACTATCGTGTCG-3′, and a BamHI site (in bold type) 3′ to the gene without its stop codon, 5′-AGATGGATCCTTGGGCGTATTTCCTCCCCTTCAGC-3′, respectively, were employed. The amplified material was digested by BspHI and BamHI and inserted between the compatible NcoI and BglII sites of vectors pET2160 (T7 promoter) (8Caravano A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Brondello J.-M. Vincent S.P. Sinaÿ P. Chem. Eur. J. 2003; 9: 5888-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and pTrcHis60 (trc promoter) (21Pompeo F. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4799-4803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), generating plasmids pABO6 and pABO7, respectively, that code for T. maritima MurE with an Arg-Ser-(His)6 C-terminal extension. The constructions were verified by DNA sequencing (MWG-Biotech). Plasmids pABO6 and pABO7 were transformed into E. coli strains BL21(DE3)/pLysS and DH5α, respectively, for expression. Purification of the MurE Enzyme—BL21(DE3)/pLysS/pABO6 cells were grown exponentially at 37 °C in 2YT medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol (700 ml of culture). When the optical density reached 0.4, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued for 4 h (final optical density, 3.5). The cells were harvested at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed with cold 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A; 15 ml). They were resuspended in buffer A (6 ml) and disrupted by sonication in the cold using a Bioblock Vibracell 72412 sonicator. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 200,000 × g with a Beckman TL100 apparatus, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was kept at –20 °C. The His6-tagged MurE protein was purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate-agarose following the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen). All of the operations were performed at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with the polymer (1 ml) previously washed with buffer A containing 0.3 m KCl and 10 mm imidazole. The suspension was stirred gently for 2 h in a test tube rotator. Elution was performed with a discontinuous imidazole gradient (20–200 mm) in buffer A containing 0.3 m KCl (the protein was eluted between 60 and 150 mm imidazole). The fractions of interest were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A. The amount of protein recovered, determined by quantitative amino acid analysis, was 3.7 mg (concentration, 0.73 mg/ml). The purity on SDS-PAGE was estimated to be >90%. The enzyme was stored at –20 °C in the presence of 10% glycerol for more than a year without a loss of activity. Cloning of the murF Gene and Purification of the MurF Enzyme—The same techniques were used for the cloning of the murF gene and the purification of the MurF protein from T. maritima with a His6 N-terminal extension. From 1 liter of culture, 18 mg of protein (concentration, 2.05 mg/ml) with a >90% purity were obtained. Purification of the MraY Enzyme—The MraY enzyme from T. maritima was purified from membranes of E. coli CD43(DE3) cells overexpressing the T. maritima mraY gene by using the same protocol as the one described for the Bacillus subtilis enzyme (12Bouhss A. Crouvoisier M. Blanot D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29974-29980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Protein Monitoring—Protein concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis with a Hitachi L8800 analyzer (ScienceTec) after hydrolysis of samples in 6 m HCl at 105 °C for 24 h. MurE Assay—The MurE activity was assayed by measuring the formation of UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-[14C]Glu-l-Lys in mixtures (final volume, 50 μl) containing 0.1 m ethanolamine-HCl, pH 9.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 100 μm UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-[14C]Glu (420 Bq), 200 μm l-lysine, and enzyme (15 μl of an appropriate dilution in buffer A). After 30 min at 68 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of glacial acetic acid. The mixture was lyophilized and taken up in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 7.2 mm sodium hexane sulfonate, pH 2.5, acetonitrile 98.5:1.5 (v/v), and radioactive substrate and product were separated on a Nucleosil 100C18 5U column (150 × 4.6 mm; Alltech-France) with the same mixture at 0.6 ml/min as a mobile phase. Detection was performed with a radioactive flow detector (model LB-506-C1; Berthold) using the Quicksafe Flow 2 scintillator (Zinsser Analytic) at 0.6 ml/min. Quantification was carried out with the Winflow software (Berthold). For the determination of the kinetic constants, the same assay was used with various concentrations of one substrate and fixed concentrations of the others. In all cases, the substrate consumption was <20%, the linearity being ensured within this interval even at the lowest nucleotide concentration. The data were fitted to the equation v = VmaxS/(Km + S) or v = VmaxS/(Km + S + S2/Ki) using the MDFitt software developed by M. Desmadril (IBBMC, Orsay, France). Identical conditions were used when d-Lys or l-Orn were assayed as the amino acid substrate; with meso-A2pm, the mobile phase used was 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 3.9 (22Flouret B. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Preparation of l- and d-Lysine-containing UDP-MurNAc-tripeptides—The reaction mixtures (final volume, 1 ml) contained 0.1 m ethanolamine-HCl, pH 9.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 500 μm UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu, 3 mm l- or d-lysine, and enzyme from T. maritima (7.3 μg). After 1.5 h at 68 °C, they were lyophilized, and each nucleotide product was purified by filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (115 × 2 cm) in water (23Rosenthal S. Sharon N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 83: 378-380PubMed Google Scholar), followed by HPLC on a Vydac 218TP1010 column (250 × 10 mm; eluent A, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; eluent B, 0.035% trifluoroacetic acid, methanol 4:1; gradient, 100% A for 5 min, 0–100% B for 20 min, 100% B for 10 min, at 2.5 ml/min). The yields were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. The nature of each product as lysine-containing UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using the conditions of Girardin et al. (24Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H. Hervé M. Blanot D. Boneca I.G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41702-41708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The d-lysine-containing UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide was also produced by MurE from E. coli (6Gordon E. Flouret B. Chantalat L. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Dideberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10999-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this case, the buffer was 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, and the MgCl2 concentration was 100 mm. Preparation of Radiolabeled UDP-MurNAc-tripeptides—The reaction mixtures (final volume, 70 μl) contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.90 mm UDP-MurNAc, 0.93 mm l-[14C]Ala (0.4 MBq), 5 mm d-Glu, and MurC and MurD from E. coli (12 and 20 μg, respectively). After 5 h at 37 °C, 10 mm (final concentration) l-or d-Lys and 3.5 μg of MurE from T. maritima were added, the temperature was raised to 68 °C, and the incubation was continued for 3 h. The labeled nucleotides were purified as described above. Enzymatic Determination of Lysine Stereochemistry—Each nucleotide (20 nmol) was hydrolyzed by 6 m HCl at 95 °C for 16 h. After evaporation of the acid, the hydrolyzates were taken up in 50 μl of 0.5 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, and incubated with 300 μg of l-lysine decarboxylase (Worthington) at 37 °C for 3 h. The reaction mixtures were lyophilized, taken up in 67 mm trisodium citrate-HCl buffer, pH 2.2, and injected into the amino acid analyzer. Dinitrophenylation—Each nucleotide (40 nmol in 50 μl of water) was mixed with 25 μl of 0.1 m dinitrofluorobenzene in ethanol and 10 μl of triethylamine. After 30 min at 60 °C in the dark, the mixtures were evaporated, and the residues were taken up in 200 μl of 6 m HCl and extracted with ether to remove dinitrophenol. They were then hydrolyzed at 95 °C for 16 h. After evaporation of the acid, the hydrolyzates were taken up in water (20 μl), and 3 μl were spotted on plates of silica gel 60 (Merck) developed in 1-butanol, acetic acid, water 3:1:1 (solvent 1) or in 1-butanol, pyridine, acetic acid, water 30:10:3:12 (solvent 2). Authentic samples of Nα- and Nε-DNP-lysine were deposited on the same plates. MurF assay—The MurF activity was assayed by measuring the formation of radioactive UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide in mixtures (final volume, 50 μl) containing 0.1 m ethanolamine-HCl, pH 9.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 200 μm radiolabeled UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide (840 Bq), 5 mm d-Ala-d-Ala, and enzyme (15 μl of an appropriate dilution in buffer A). After 30 min (l-Lys-containing nucleotide) or 4 h (d-Lys-containing nucleotide) at 68 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of glacial acetic acid, and the mixtures were analyzed by HPLC with on-line scintillation counting as described for MurE, except that the mobile phase was 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 6.0. MraY Assay—The MraY activity was assayed as previously described (12Bouhss A. Crouvoisier M. Blanot D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29974-29980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), but at 68 °C, using the radiolabeled UDP-MurNAc-peptides. Isolation of Peptidoglycan from E. coli Cells—DH5α/pABO7 cells were grown as described above, without and with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. Induction was initiated at an optical density of 0.34 and continued for 2 h. Peptidoglycan was purified by hot SDS treatment, followed by successive incubations with pancreatine, pronase, and trypsin, as already described (25Mengin-Lecreulx D. Flouret B. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots were hydrolyzed (6 m HCl, 95 °C, 16 h), and the hydrolyzates were injected into the amino acid analyzer before and after incubation with l-lysine decarboxylase. Extraction of the Free Amino Acids from T. maritima—T. maritima cells were grown as described in the literature (7Huber R. Langworthy T.A. König H. Thomm M. Woese C.R. Sleytr U.B. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 324-333Crossref Scopus (631) Google Scholar). After harvesting, 0.6 g of wet cell pellet was put into 25 ml of boiling water and heated at 100 °C for 30 min. After chilling in ice water, cold trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 5%. The resulting suspension was kept at 4 °C for 20 min before centrifugation (15,000 × g for 20 min). The resulting supernatant was extracted three times with ether to remove trichloroacetic acid, adjusted to pH 7 by sodium hydroxide, and lyophilized. The residue was taken up in 2 ml of water, and aliquots were injected into the amino acid analyzer before and after incubation with l-lysine decarboxylase, thereby allowing the quantitation of the amino acid pools. Overproduction and Purification of MurE from T. maritima—The murE gene from T. maritima chromosome was cloned into vector pET2160, which allows the expression of proteins with a C-terminal His tag (8Caravano A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Brondello J.-M. Vincent S.P. Sinaÿ P. Chem. Eur. J. 2003; 9: 5888-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The MurE protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. The purification was monitored: (i) by SDS-PAGE and (ii) by an assay of addition of l-lysine to UDP-MurNAc-dipeptide; this amino acid was chosen because T. maritima peptidoglycan had been shown to contain lysine and not A2pm (7Huber R. Langworthy T.A. König H. Thomm M. Woese C.R. Sleytr U.B. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 324-333Crossref Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein exhibited a molecular mass of ∼56 kDa as judged by SDS-PAGE. The yield was 5.3 mg per liter of culture. Enzymatic Properties—The behavior of the l-lysine adding activity as a function of temperature, pH, and magnesium concentration was studied. Curves (Fig. 1) displayed the usual bell shape, with optimal values of 68 °C, 9.4, and 15 mm, respectively. Examination of the first curve (Fig. 1A) indicated that at 37 °C, the temperature at which the enzyme was expressed, the activity was ∼25% of the optimal value. Alternative Amino Acid Substrates and Kinetic Parameters—With l-lysine as the amino acid substrate, the Vmax of the enzyme was 56 μmol/min/mg (Table 1). However, because a strong inhibition by excess UDP-MurNAc-dipeptide was observed (Table 1 and Fig. 2A), this value is only theoretical. To have a compromise between enzyme saturation and substrate inhibition, the fixed value of this substrate was set at 0.2 mm. The kinetic parameters found for the amino acid substrates were therefore apparent, but they could be compared with one another. Besides l-lysine, T. maritima MurE was shown to be capable of adding d-lysine and meso-A2pm to UDP-MurNAc-dipeptide. With respect to Vmax/Km ratio for l-lysine, those for the latter amino acids were 4- and 10-fold lower, respectively. A weak but significant addition of l-ornithine was also detected (Vmax/Km ratio: 460-fold lower than that for l-lysine). The kinetic parameters for all substrates are shown in Table 1, and representative curves are shown in Fig. 2.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of MurE from T. maritimaSubstrateApparent KmApparent VmaxApparent Vmax/Kmmmμmol/min/mgμmol/min/mm/mgATPaDetermined with l-lysine as the amino acid substrate.3.6 ± 0.325 ± 16.9UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-GluaDetermined with l-lysine as the amino acid substrate.,bThe kinetic parameters for this substrate were determined by fitting the data to the equation ν = VmaxS/(Km + S + S2/Ki); the Ki value found was 0.066 ± 0.012 mm.0.45 ± 0.1056 ± 5120l-Lysine2.8 ± 0.227 ± 29.6d-Lysine1.7 ± 0.34.1 ± 0.32.4meso-A2pm4.8 ± 0.74.8 ± 0.31.0l-Ornithine27 ± 10.57 ± 0.010.021a Determined with l-lysine as the amino acid substrate.b The kinetic parameters for this substrate were determined by fitting the data to the equation ν = VmaxS/(Km + S + S2/Ki); the Ki value found was 0.066 ± 0.012 mm. Open table in a new tab Structure of the Lysine-containing UDP-MurNAc-tripeptides Produced by MurE from T. maritima—The UDP-MurNAc-tripeptides formed upon the addition of either enantiomer of lysine were purified, and their chemical identity was confirmed by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry (Table 2). In analytical HPLC (22Flouret B. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the nucleotide formed from l-lysine had the same retention time as authentic UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Lys, whereas the one formed from d-lysine had a higher value (Table 2). l-Lysine decarboxylase digestion of acid hydrolyzates showed that the stereochemistry of lysine in the nucleotides was the same as that of the starting amino acids (Table 2). To identify the amino function of lysine (α or ε) involved in the isopeptide bond with the γ-carboxyl function of d-Glu, both nucleotides were dinitrophenylated and hydrolyzed. TLC in two different solvent systems showed that in the l-lysine-containing nucleotide, lysine was acylated on its α-amino function, whereas in the d-lysine-containing nucleotide, it was acylated on its ε-amino function (Table 2 and Fig. 3).TABLE 2Analysis of the lysine-containing UDP-MurNAc-tripeptides produced by MurE from T. maritimaNucleotide synthesized fromYieldaCalculated from quantitative amino acid analysis of the nucleotides.Retention timebAnalytical HPLC on Vydac C18 (250 × 4.6 mm) in 50 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5, at 1 ml/min.

Open table in a new tab The UDP-MurNAc-tripeptides as Possible Substrates for MurF and MraY—We wanted to check whether the UDP-MurNAc-tripeptides were substrates for the downstream enzymes MurF and MraY from T. maritima. For this purpose, both enzymes were purified, and the nucleotides were synthesized in a radioactive form. As expected, the l-lysine-containing nucleotide was a substrate for MurF, whereas the d-lysine-containing nucleotide was not. With MraY, the d-lysine-containing UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide was processed as efficiently as the conventional UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. The l-lysine-containing UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide was a substrate, too, but to a lesser extent (Table 3).TABLE 3Effect of MurF and MraY from T. maritima on the UDP-MurNAc-peptidesCompoundActivityaMean ± S.D. of a triplicate determination.nmol/min/mgMurF UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide (l-Lys)230 ± 10 UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide (d-Lys)NDbND, not detected (no product formation after 4 h with 3 μg of MurF).MraY UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide (l-Lys)3.4 ± 0.2 UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide (d-Lys)21 ± 2 UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (l-Lys)19 ± 1a Mean ± S.D. of a triplicate determination.b ND, not detected (no product formation after 4 h with 3 μg of MurF).

Regulation of DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis by UvrB is poorly understood. Using atomic force microscopy and biochemical assays, we found that truncation of domain 4 of Bacillus caldotenax UvrB (UvrBΔ4) leads to multiple changes in protein function. Protein dimerization decreases with an ∼8-fold increase of the equilibrium dissociation constant and an increase in DNA binding. Loss of domain 4 causes the DNA binding mode of UvrB to change from dimer to monomer, and affinity increases with the apparent dissociation constants on nondamaged and damaged single-stranded DNA decreasing 22- and 14-fold, respectively. ATPase activity by UvrBΔ4 increases 14- and 9-fold with and without single-stranded DNA, respectively, and UvrBΔ4 supports UvrA-independent damage-specific incision by Cho on a bubble DNA substrate. We propose that other than its previously discovered role in regulating protein-protein interactions, domain 4 is an autoinhibitory domain regulating the DNA binding and ATPase activities of UvrB.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It is believed that UvrA, as a dimer within the UvrAB complex, first recognizes helical distortions induced by DNA damage. Upon binding of UvrAB (either as UvrA2B or UvrA2B2) to the site of DNA damage (4Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After dissociation of UvrA from the protein-DNA complex, a very stable UvrB-DNA preincision complex is formed. UvrC recruitment by the UvrB-DNA precincision complex to the site of DNA damage leads to dual incisions on the damaged DNA strand (11Sancar A. Rupp W.D.

In the absence of UvrA, UvrB binds weakly to DNA and has no ATPase activity (2Goosen N. Moolenaar G.F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Hsu D.S.

In the presence of DNA damage, through interaction with UvrA both DNA binding and ATPase activities of UvrB are activated. This allosteric control of UvrB activation is not well understood. UvrB is classified as a member of the helicase superfamily II (15Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the proteins from different organisms (16Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B.

Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2498-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have shed light on structural components of UvrB. UvrB consists of five domains, namely 1a, 1b, 2, 3, and 4 (16Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Even though UvrB contains all the elements of an intact helicase, including all residues implicated in coupling ATP hydrolysis to strand translocation, it is not a true helicase (2Goosen N. Moolenaar G.F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3Van Houten B. Croteau D.L. Della Vecchia M.J. Wang H. Kisker C. Mutat.

Rather, the limited DNA unwinding activity of UvrAB complex is believed to be important in destabilizing duplex DNA and creating an “entry site” for UvrB to form a stable UvrB-DNA preincision complex (2Goosen N. Moolenaar G.F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Gordienko I. Rupp W.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 880-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Zou Y. Van Houten B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4889-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A unique structural element in UvrB is a flexible β-hairpin that extrudes from domain 1a, near the wall of domain 1b. Based on superposition of the UvrB structure with known structures of UvrB-related helicase-DNA complexes, a padlock model for the UvrB-DNA preincision complex was proposed (16Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 22Theis K. Skorvaga M. Machius M. Nakagawa N. Van Houten B. Kisker C. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 277-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this model, the β-hairpin bifurcates the duplex DNA, and one of the single strands is locked between the β-hairpin and domain 1b. This model was recently confirmed by a UvrB-DNA co-crystal structure (49Truglio J.J. Karakas E. Rhau B. Wang H. Della Vecchia M.J. Van Houten B. Kisker C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain 4 of UvrB is not visible in any of the available full-length UvrB crystal structures. However, crystallography and NMR spectroscopy studies of the C-terminal fragment of E. coli UvrB have revealed that the last 46 amino acids of domain 4 adapt a coiled-coil structure and dimerize through specific hydrophobic and ionic interactions (23Sohi M. Alexandrovich A. Moolenaar G. Visse R. Goosen N. Vernede X. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Champness J. Sanderson M.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Alexandrovich A. Czisch M. Frenkiel T.A. Kelly G.P. Goosen N. Moolenaar G.F. Chowdhry B.Z. Sanderson M.R. Lane A.N. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2001; 19: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been demonstrated that domain 4 is involved in interacting with UvrC and promoting dimer formation of UvrB (5Verhoeven E.E. Wyman C. Moolenaar G.F. Goosen N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4196-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27885-27890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide quantitative measurement of the effect of domain 4 on UvrB self-association, and demonstrate that domain 4 functions as an autoinhibitory domain. Autoinhibitory domains are regions that negatively regulate the activity of a second, separable domain and can provide tight “on site” repression that restrains the targeted domain in a secure off state (26Pufall M.A. Graves B.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 421-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Autoinhibition is a general method for achieving a high level of specificity and tight regulation in DNA binding site selection (26Pufall M.A. Graves B.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 421-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Specifically, we show that truncation of domain 4 (residues Pro612 to Gly658) of UvrB leads to: 1) a change in UvrB DNA binding mode and increase in DNA binding affinity; 2) an increase in UvrB ATPase activity; and 3) UvrA-independent, damage-specific incision of a bubble substrate mediated by Cho (UvrC homolog). These data suggest that DNA repair enzymes may represent another important class of DNA-binding proteins that are regulated by autoinhibitory domains. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of B. caldotenax UvrA, UvrB, and Escherichia coli Cho Proteins—Genes encoding B. caldotenax UvrA, UvrB, and E. coli Cho were subcloned in the pTYB1 vector of the T7 IMPACT system (New England Biolabs). The domain 4 truncation mutation of B. caldotenax UvrB (UvrBΔ4, sequence between Pro612 to Gly658 deleted) was constructed following the protocol of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The presence of the desired deletion and absence of additional mutations in the entire amplified uvrB gene were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Domain 2 deletion of B. caldotenax UvrB (UvrBΔ2, sequence between Leu157 and Pro245 deleted) was constructed as described previously (19Truglio J.J. Croteau D.L. Skorvaga M. Della Vecchia M.J. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2498-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). UvrA and UvrB proteins were expressed in Rosettagami(DE3)pLacI (Merck Biosciences) and BL21-CodonPlus®(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) cells, respectively. Mutant UvrB proteins were expressed following the same procedures used for wild type (WT). All proteins were purified using the IMPACT™-CN system (New England Biolabs) as described previously (16Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For purification of Cho, pooled material after elution from a chitin-binding column was purified further over a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2). Proteins used in this study are more than 95% pure as judged by staining of SDS-PAGE protein gel with SimplyBlue™ SafeStain (Invitrogen). DNA Substrates—DNA substrates were synthesized by Sigma Genosys and 5′ labeled using OptiKinase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/μl, GE Healthcare) or 3′ labeled using terminal transferase (Roche Applied Science) and [α-32P]ATP (10 μCi/μl, GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Reactions were terminated with 20 mm EDTA and heat denaturation (65 °C, 10 min). Free nucleotides were subsequently removed by gel filtration chromatography (Micro Biospin-6, Bio-Rad). Fully duplexed DNA (F50/NDB50) and bubble DNA (F50/B8) were constructed by annealing labeled F50 (4 pmol) with equal molar amounts of their respective “bottom” strands. Double-stranded character and homogeneity of the annealed DNA were examined on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel. The 5′ end-labeled duplex DNA containing the UV-activated arylazido cross-linker moiety, XL225, was prepared as described previously (10Della Vecchia M.J. Croteau D.L. Skorvaga M. Dezhurov S.V.

The DNA substrate (HS1F-M13mp19) used for the strand-destabilizing assays was labeled and constructed as described previously (27Skorvaga M. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Kisker C. Van Houten B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1553-1559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Atomic Force Microscopy—Proteins were diluted in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) and heated (65 °C, 10 min). Afterward, samples were deposited onto freshly cleaved ruby mica (Spruce Pine Mica Company) pre-warmed to 55 °C on a hot plate. Sample preparation and image collection using Nanoscope III (Veeco Instruments) operated in tapping mode in air were done as described previously (28Wang H. Yang Y. Schofield M.J. Du C. Fridman Y.

The atomic force microscopy (AFM)-derived volume for each protein was obtained as described previously (29Ratcliff G.C. Erie D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5632-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The standard equation employed for converting AFM volume (nm3) to molecular mass (Mr) is given by the following equation (30Yang Y. Wang H. Erie D.A.

Mr=AFMvolume+14.71.2(Eq. 1) Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Proteins and ssDNA substrates were preheated (65 °C, 10 min) prior to mixing. For single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), UvrB (WT or Δ4) was incubated with 1 nm DNA substrate (5′-32P-labeled) in 20 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) at 55 °C for 30 min. Half of the reaction was removed immediately after incubation and loaded onto an 8% native polyacrylamide gel (29:1). Gels were run (100 V, 4 h, 4 °C) in 1× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2.5 mm EDTA). For bubble DNA, the procedures are the same except that the reactions were done in 1× ABC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 7 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were loaded onto a 6 or 8% native polyacrylamide gel (29:1) containing 0.5× TBE, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP. Gels were run (100 V, 2 h, 4 °C) in buffer containing 0.5× TBE, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP. All gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare) overnight. The B1- and B2-DNA complexes were resolved as distinct peaks and quantified using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). The concentration of protein dimer and monomer in each reaction was determined as described in Table 2. The apparent dissociation constants of B2-DNA for WT UvrB and B1-DNA complex for UvrBΔ4 were determined by nonlinear regression analysis (Table 2) (31Schofield M.J. Lilley D.M. White M.F.

Reactions were irradiated for 5 min on a platform 5 cm below a 365-nm UV lamp (UVP, Blak-Ray Longwave UV Mercury lamp, 100 watts). NuPage (Invitrogen) 4× lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer (8 μl) containing dithiothreitol was added to 12 μl of the reaction and heated (85 °C, 15 min). Cross-linked products were resolved on a 10% NuPage BisTris gel in 1× NuPage MOPS SDS running buffer. Gels were dried, developed via PhosphorImager, and quantified using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). ATP/GTP Hydrolysis Assay—Hydrolysis of ATP or GTP by UvrAB was monitored using a coupled enzyme assay system (32Panuska J.R. Goldthwait D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5208-5214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as previously described with minor modifications (19Truglio J.J. Croteau D.L. Skorvaga M. Della Vecchia M.J. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2498-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, ATP or GTP (Roche) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm in 100 μl containing: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 55 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units/ml l-lactic dehydrogenase (Sigma), 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase (Sigma), 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate (Roche), 0.15 mm NADH (Roche), 50 nm UvrA, and 100 nm UvrB (WT or Δ4). Proteins were assayed without DNA (–DNA), or in the presence of 10 ng/μl UV-irradiated DNA (+UV DNA, prepared by exposure of 1 μg/μl pUC18 plasmid DNA to 200 J/m2 for 1 min) or nondamaged 50-mer ssDNA (+ssDNA, complementary to NDT50). Rate of hydrolysis was calculated from the linear change in absorbance at 340 nm at 55 °C over 30 min, using a Beckman spectrophotometer. Data are reported as the mean rate (M/min) ± S.D. (n = 3). Strand-destabilizing Assay—This assay was done as described previously and the incubations were done at 42 °C (27Skorvaga M. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Kisker C. Van Houten B. J. Biol.

Incision Assays—The 3′-end labeled DNA (2 nm), F50/NDB50 or F50/B8, was incubated with 100 nm UvrB (WT or Δ4) with or without UvrA (20 nm), in 1× ABC buffer (18 μl), at 55 °C for 15 min. After reactions cooled to room temperature, E. coli Cho (2 μl, 0.5 μm) was added (37 °C, 30 min). Reactions were terminated with 200 mm EDTA (2 μl), heated to 85 °C (10 min), and cooled on ice. Incision products were resolved on an 18% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (375 V, 50 min, 1× TBE buffer). Gels were processed and developed. Incision products were quantified as described above.

We examined the effects of domain 4 truncation on: 1) UvrB self-association; 2) UvrB single-stranded, bubble and duplex DNA binding; 3) UvrB ATPase activity; 4) strand-destabilizing activity of a UvrAB complex; and 5) ability of UvrB to support UvrA-independent incision mediated by Cho. Equilibrium Dissociation Constants of WT UvrB and UvrBΔ4 Dimer—A key issue in understanding the DNA damage recognition process during NER is the oligomeric state of UvrB. Despite evidence showing that UvrB dimerizes in solution and on DNA (5Verhoeven E.E. Wyman C. Moolenaar G.F. Goosen N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4196-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Hildebrand E.L. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27885-27890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we still lack quantitative measurement of the thermodynamic parameters of UvrB self-association and effect of domain 4 truncation on UvrB dimerization. These measurements are prerequisite for understanding the role of UvrB dimer in the NER pathway. To obtain the equilibrium dissociation constants of WT UvrB and UvrBΔ4 dimers, we took the unique approach of utilizing the protein size information obtained from AFM images. Using topographical AFM images, AFM-derived volumes of proteins have been correlated to their molecular masses, permitting determination of oligomeric states and equilibrium dissociation constants of proteins (29Ratcliff G.C. Erie D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5632-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 30Yang Y. Wang H. Erie D.A.

AFM offers the advantage of assaying proteins with low solubility or with tight binding constants. In addition, sample deposition for AFM imaging can be done over a wide range of temperatures, which is advantageous for studying thermophilic proteins. Using AFM volume analysis, we found that B. caldotenax UvrA dimer has an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 3 nm (Table 1). These results are consistent with previously published data (Kd at ∼10 nm for E. coli UvrA) (34Myles G.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3824-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Next, we analyzed WT UvrB. A representative field view AFM image of WT UvrB (20 nm) is shown in Fig. 2A. The inset is a surface plot of the boxed region (pink). The surface plot of WT UvrB clearly shows two distinct populations: proteins with a larger volume (Fig. 2A, green arrows) and those with a smaller volume (white arrows).TABLE 1Estimation of equilibrium dissociation constants of protein dimersProteinEquilibrium dissociation constants (nM) (Kd, mean ± S.D)Previously reported dataUvrA3 ± 2∼10 nMWT UvrB5 ± 2NRaNR, not reported.UvrBΔ24 ± 2NRUvrBΔ438 ± 8NRa NR, not reported. Open table in a new tab Histograms of AFM-derived volumes of WT UvrB are shown in Fig. 2B. At 20 nm protein concentration, two distinct peaks are observed at 70 ± 20 and 156 ± 33 nm3, respectively. Using Equation 1 (see “Materials and Methods”), the peak at 70 nm3 was calculated to correspond to a ∼70-kDa protein, consistent with the size of the UvrB monomer (75 kDa). The peak at 156 nm3 corresponds to a ∼140-kDa protein, consistent with the size of the UvrB dimer (150 kDa). Based on the population of proteins under each peak, the Kd for UvrB dimer is estimated to be 5 nm (Table 1). The histogram of AFM-derived volumes for UvrBΔ4(20 nm) also displays two distinct peaks similar to WT UvrB, but located at 89 ± 21 and 175 ± 33 nm3 (Fig. 2C). These volumes correspond to protein molecular masses of ∼86 and ∼158 kDa, respectively, and are within error of the expected protein size for UvrBΔ4 monomer (65 kDa) and dimer (130 kDa). Compared with the number of protein dimers observed for WT UvrB (217 of 390, 56%), the number of UvrBΔ4 protein dimers observed is almost 50% less (126 of 390, 32%). The Kd for UvrBΔ4 dimer is estimated to be 38 nm (Table 1), ∼8-fold higher than WT UvrB. As a negative control, we imaged the domain 2 deletion mutant of UvrB, UvrBΔ2. Domain 2 of UvrB is believed to interact with UvrA and is not known to play any role in UvrB self-association (19Truglio J.J. Croteau D.L. Skorvaga M. Della Vecchia M.J. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2498-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The histogram of AFM-derived volumes of UvrBΔ2 (20 nm) also displays two distinct peaks (located at 50 ± 20 and 120 ± 30 nm3, Fig. 2D), which correspond to protein molecular masses of ∼54 and ∼112 kDa, respectively, and are close to that expected for the UvrBΔ2 monomer (60 kDa) and dimer (120 kDa). The Kd for UvrBΔ2 dimer is estimated to be 4 nm (Table 1). Comparing the Kd values of WT, Δ2, and Δ4 UvrB dimers (Table 1) indicates that loss of C-terminal domain 4 significantly alters UvrB monomer-dimer equilibrium, whereas deletion of domain 2 does not have a detectable effect. DNA Binding Affinity of WT UvrB and UvrBΔ4 Measured by EMSA—Because UvrB has a higher affinity for ssDNA than for duplex DNA (14Hsu D.S. Kim S.T. Sun Q. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8319-8327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we first examined ssDNA binding using EMSA to quantitatively compare the DNA binding affinity of WT UvrB and UvrBΔ4. The nondamaged ssDNA substrate used for this assay was a 50-mer, NDT50 (Fig. 3A). The damaged ssDNA substrate, F50, has a fluorescein adduct attached to a centrally located thymine (Fig. 3A). Representative EMSA gels are shown in Fig. 4A. We observed that UvrBΔ4 has greater affinity for ssDNA than WT UvrB. For example, at 1.5 μm WT UvrB, only 48% of F50 is bound (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Conversely, at the same protein concentration, close to 90% of F50 is bound by UvrBΔ4 (Fig. 4A, lane 11).FIGURE 4DNA binding affinity of WT UvrB and UvrBΔ4 for ssDNA.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7733-7740Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For the curve fitting, R2 values are ∼0.96 and 0.87 for WT and Δ4 data, respectively. The sigmoidal shape of the Δ4 data is because of the loss of the DNA counts in the smear (not counted as protein-DNA complex) at lower protein concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Notably, two populations of UvrB-DNA complexes are observed via EMSA (faster and slower migrating complexes are labeled B1-DNA and B2-DNA, respectively, in Fig. 4A). These two bands are observed for both WT UvrB and UvrBΔ4. The percentages of B1- and B2-DNA complexes versus total protein concentrations are plotted in Fig. 4A (bottom panel).

We investigated the regulatory role of the serine cluster residing immediately adjacent to the HLH domain and of the serines in the NEMO/IKKγ-binding domain (NBD/γBD) in the C-terminal portion of IKKβ in MEFs deficient in IKKβ and IKKα and in yeast reconstitution system. We show that phosphorylation events at the C terminus of IKKβ can be divided into autophosphorylation of the serine cluster adjacent to the HLH domain and phosphorylation of the NBD/γBD. Autophosphorylation of the serine cluster occurs immediately after IKK activation and requires IKKγ. In MEFs, this autophosphorylation does not have the down-regulatory function on the IKK complex that was previously described (1Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). On the other hand, phosphorylation of the NBD/γBD regulates IKKγ-dependent phosphorylation of the T-loop activation domain in IKKβ and, hence, IKK complex activation. Our study suggests that, within the IKK complex, modulation of the NBD/γBD by IKKγ is upstream to the T-loop phosphorylation.

Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). IKK is composed of two homologous catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ (85 and 87 kDa, respectively), and an unrelated regulatory 52-kDa subunit IKKγ (5Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) also known as NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) (6Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). IKKγ is required for the stimulation of IKK by upstream signals such as TNF, Tax, lipopolysaccharide, and interleukin 1 (5Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M.

Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). IκBs regulate the activity of the NF-κB transcription factors. NF-κBs control the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immunity, stress, and regulation of apoptosis and cellular proliferation. In resting cells, most NF-κB dimers are bound to inhibitory IκB proteins and sequestered in the cytoplasm (7Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). Diverse stimuli, including cytokines, bacterial and viral products, oxidants, and mitogens lead to activation of IKK, which phosphorylates two regulatory serine residues on IκBs (8Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation leads to recognition by the protein, β-TrCP, and to polyubiquitination by a specific ubiquitin ligase (9Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I. Amit S. Manning A.M. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mercurio F. Ben-Neriah Y. Nature. 1998; 396: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 10Strack P. Caligiuri M. Pelletier M. Boisclair M. Theodoras A. Beer-Romero P. Glass S. Parsons T. Copeland R.A. Auger K.R. Benfield P. Brizuela L. Rolfe M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3529-3536Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After ubiquitination, the IκB proteins are rapidly degraded by the proteasome. This frees NF-κB, which migrates to the nucleus where it binds to and stimulates the transcription of target genes (7Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). IKK complexes are composed of equal numbers of catalytic subunits (IKKα and/or β) and regulatory γ subunits (11Miller B.S. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36320-36326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ have similar structures including kinase domains and canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase activation loops (T-loops) toward their N termini (3Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). In addition, IKKα and IKKβ contain leucine zipper motifs through which the catalytic subunits associate (12Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and helix-loop-helix domains toward the C terminus (4Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). An α-helical region near the N terminus of IKKγ binds to a 6-amino acid region (NEMO/γ-binding domain) at the very C terminus of IKKα and IKKβ, and interfering with this interaction diminishes stimulation of IKK by TNFα (13May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Despite their structural similarities, IKKα and IKKβ differ. IKKβ is essential for the induction of NF-κB by most proinflammatory stimuli whereas IKKα has roles in limb development, skin differentiation, B-cell maturation, and lymphoid organogenesis (14Takeda K.

Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Moreover, IKKβ homodimer has approximately a 30-fold higher activity toward IκBα than the IKKα homodimer (20Huynh Q.K. Boddupalli H. Rouw S.A. Koboldt C.M. Hall T. Sommers C. Hauser S.D. Pierce J.L. Combs R.G. Reitz B.A. Diaz-Collier J.A. Weinberg R.A. Hood B.L. Kilpatrick B.F. Tripp C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25883-25891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Some of these differences may be attributed, in part, to an ubiquitin-like domain present in IKKβ but not IKKα. This domain is located between the kinase domain and leucine zipper of IKKβ, and its mutation or deletion causes loss of activity in IKKβ (21May M.J. Larsen S.E. Shim J.H. Madge L.A. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45528-45539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Like its substrate IκBα, IKK is regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination. TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) is essential for IKK signaling through the IL-1 receptor and Toll-like receptor (22Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C. Ho A. Morony S. Capparelli C. Van G. Kaufman S. van der Heiden A. Itie A. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Sasaki T. Cao Z. Penninger J.M. Paige C.J. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Boyle W.J. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). TRAF6 contains a RING domain that acts as a ubiquitin ligase (23Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It undergoes trans-auto-ubiquitination (24Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar), and it also ubiquitinates IKKγ (25Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Blocking ubiquitination prevents TRAF6-mediated activation of IKK (26Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). Moreover, the T cell receptor appears to activate IKK via BCL10 and MALT1, which induce the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6. RNA interference data indicate that TRAF2 and TRAF6 are required for IKK activation after T cell receptor ligation (25Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In addition, other signaling pathways that induce IKK activity including NOD2 (which serves as an intracellular signal for bacteria) and genotoxic stress, activate NF-κB by ubiquitination of various lysine residues on IKKγ (23Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 27Abbott D.W. Wilkins A. Asara J.M. Cantley L.C. Curr.

Cell. 2003; 115: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). IKK may be down-regulated by deubiquitinating proteases such as CYLD (the protein mutated in familial cylindromatosis), which associate with IKKγ and deubiquitinate TRAF2 and TRAF6 (29Brummelkamp T.R. Nijman S.M. Dirac A.M. Bernards R. Nature. 2003; 424: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 30Kovalenko A. Chable-Bessia C. Cantarella G. Israel A. Wallach D. Courtois G.

Nature. 2003; 424: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). All three subunits of IKK become phosphorylated within 10 min following treatment of HeLa cells with TNF, with concomitant stimulation of IKK activity (1Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). IKK is inactivated by protein phosphatase 2a, indicating that it is activated by phosphorylation (2DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). IKK can also be dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase PP2Cβ, and it has been shown to associate with PP2Cβ with kinetics consistent with a role in down-regulating its activity (32Prajapati S. Verma U. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1739-1746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide mapping of IKKβ indicates that phosphorylation occurs at serine residues in the T-loop (Ser177 and Ser181) and at a cluster of serines located between the HLH domain and the C terminus (1Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Mutation of the T-loop serines of IKKβ to alanines prevents IKK activation in mammalian cell lines, whereas conversion of these residues to glutamic acids makes the kinase constitutively active, indicating that the kinase is activated by phosphorylation of the T-loop (1Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 3Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the T-loop of IKKβ, which occurs when IKK is activated, is followed by progressive phosphorylation of the cluster of serines at its C terminus (1Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation was suggested to play a role in down-regulating the activity of IKK in HeLa cells (1Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). A mutation mimicking phosphorylation in the NEMO/γ binding domain (NBD/γBD) of IKKβ diminishes its ability to activate NF-κB, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue, in particular, may have regulatory significance (33May M.J. Marienfeld R.B. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45992-46000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the regulatory role of the serine cluster residing immediately after the HLH domain and the serines in the NBD/γBD in the C terminus of IKKβ in MEFs deficient in IKKβ and IKKα and in yeast reconstitution system. We show that phosphorylation events at the C terminus of IKKβ can be divided into autophosphorylation of the serine cluster immediately following the HLH domain, and phosphorylation of the NBD/γBD. Autophosphorylation of the serine cluster occurs immediately after IKK activation, and requires IKKγ. In MEFs, this autophosphorylation does not have the previously reported down-regulatory function (1Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). On the other hand, phosphorylation of the NBD/γBD regulates IKKγ-dependent phosphorylation of the T-loop activation domain in IKKβ and, hence, IKK complex activation. Our study puts regulation of the NBD/γBD through IKKγ upstream of the T-loop phosphorylation and IKK activation.

Stable pools of MEFs for each construct were selected by growing cells in 2 mg/ml G418 sulfate (Cellgro, Mediatech, Inc.) for 6 weeks. Stable pools were maintained in 0.25 mg/ml G418 sulfate after the selection period. For experiments, 1.0 × 106 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes for 24 h, before treating with TNFα (20 ng/ml) or IL-1β (5 ng/ml) for the times indicated in the figures. Cells were harvested and the activities of IKK complexes were determined as described previously (4Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Kinase Assays and Immunoblots—GST-IκBα-(1–54) was used as a substrate for IKKβ because it contains the regulatory serines but lacks other residues that could be phosphorylated nonspecifically. It was expressed in bacteria and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Various peptides containing wild-type or mutant versions of the C terminus of IKKβ were also produced so that they could be tested as possible substrates for IKKβ. Some of these peptides contain mutations in which serines were mutated to alanines, and all of these substrates spanned from the helix-loop-helix through the C terminus of IKKβ. DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with full-length IKKβ as template using Pfu Turbo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), digested, and inserted into the bacterial expression vector pET-HET-N1, which contains a Myc tag at the 5′-end and a His6 tag at the 3′-end of the cloning site. DNA sequences of the constructs were verified by automated sequencing (Microchemical Core Facility/USC Norris Cancer Center). Plasmids were transformed into the bacterial strain BL21 and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacterial pellet from 500-ml culture was suspended in 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, sonicated for 3 min, frozen and thawed twice, and brought to a final concentration of 1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C and incubated with 1 ml of pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA superflow agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4°C. Unbound proteins were washed away, and the bound proteins were renatured with a series of 50-ml buffers containing 4 m, 2 m, 1 m, 0.5 m, and 0 m urea in phosphate-buffered saline with 10 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The IKKβ peptides were eluted with 200 mm imidazole in 1-ml fractions, and the positive fractions were pooled and dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 10% glycerol. For most kinase assays, purified human IKKβ from Sf9 cells (12Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or gel filtration-purified or immunoprecipitated IKK complex from yeast was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 μm cold ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, [γ-32P]ATP (ICN), and 2 μg of protein substrate. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 97 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad), and labeling was detected by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For some experiments, IKK activity was tested using a range of IκBα concentrations (from 4–183 μg/ml). The protocol was the same as above only the substrate concentration was varied, and the incubation time was shortened to 10 min. Cloning and Expression of IKKs in Yeast—The plasmid pESC-trpmet-HA-IKKβ containing HA-IKKβ under the methionine promoter was described previously (11Miller B.S. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36320-36326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To co-express similar levels of IKKγ and IKKβ, HA-IKKγ and its methionine promoter were inserted into the pESC-trp-met-HA-IKKβ plasmid. Various point mutations were generated in IKKβ by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). These PCR products were digested and subcloned into the vectors pESC-trp-met-HA-IKKβ and pESC-trp-met-HA-IKKβ met-HA-IKKγ. The mutated regions were verified by sequencing. Plasmids were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YPH 499 (Stratagene) using lithium acetate as described (Stratagene pESC Yeast Epitope Tagging Vectors instruction manual). 2 ml of overnight cultures of yeast were grown in selective drop-out medium (Q-Biogene) containing 4 mm methionine (Q-Biogene) to suppress IKK expression and then expanded into 400 ml of selective non-inducing medium. The yeast were grown at 30 °C with shaking at 300 rpm before transfer to inducing medium (without methionine) and induced overnight (at 30 °C with shaking). For harvesting and lysing the yeast, all steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. They were first washed in 400 mm (NH4)2SO4, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate containing protease inhibitors (2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1.1 μg/ml phosphoramidon). The pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm sodium metabisulfite, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate with protease inhibitors), transferred to yeast protein extraction vials (Q-Biogene), and frozen at –80 °C. To lyse the yeast, the vials were thawed on ice, disrupted using a Q-Biogene Fast-Prep apparatus for 20 s on speed 6, and vortexed for 5 min. The vials were spun at 10,000 × g, the supernatant was collected, and the pellets were resuspended in 0.67 ml of lysis buffer. The extraction procedure was repeated an additional three times. The combined supernatants were clarified by centrifugation for 3 min at 3000 × g followed by ultracentrifugation for 1.5 h at 65,000 × g. HA-IKK complex was then partially purified by gel filtration. 0.5 ml of extract (2–5 mg total protein) was loaded onto a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and samples were fractionated at a flow rate of 0.3 ml per minute. The gel filtration buffer contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm sodium metabisulfite, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Brij 35. Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment—Approximately 6 μg of yeast extract were immunoprecipitated using 1 μl of anti-HA antibody (USC/Norris core facility) in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm PNPP) followed by binding to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Immune complexes were pelleted and washed once with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and once with CIP buffer (calf intestinal phosphate buffer from New England BioLabs containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1.1 μg/ml phosphoramidon). Pelleted proteins were then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in a 30-μl reaction containing 10 units of calf intestinal phosphatase in CIP buffer. The alkaline phosphatase treatment was stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. For untreated controls, the addition of calf intestinal phosphatase was omitted. In Vivo Labeling—3.5-ml cultures of yeast were grown in selective medium containing 4 mm methionine to suppress IKK expression until they reached an optical density of 0.7–1.0. Then the yeast were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of selective medium without methionine (to induce IKK expression) and containing 1.4 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate. The yeast were radiolabeled and induced for 5 h, then washed with yeast wash buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, resuspended in 500 μl of yeast lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and frozen at –80 °C. The yeast were lysed as described above, and the extract was clarified by microcentrifugation for 1 min at 10,000 × g followed by 20 min at 18,000 × g. To remove contaminating nonspecific immune complexes, the extracts were first immunoprecipitated with a nonspecific FLAG antibody (Sigma) and complexed to protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). Then, HA-IKK was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibodies directed against HA (USC/Norris core facility) followed by binding to protein G-agarose. The beads were washed repeatedly in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm PNPP) before elution for 5 min at 97 °C in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were electrophoresed using SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad). Radiolabeling was detected by Phosphorimager. Blots were probed with anti-HA antibodies (USC/Norris Core Facility) followed by anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and then detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce SuperSignal reagent) using a Bio-Rad Fluor-S Max quantification system. Cyanogen Bromide (CNBr) Digestion—Yeast cells were 32P-labeled and IKK was isolated as described above. For cyanogen bromide digestion, the immunoprecipitated samples were electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel. Autoradiography was used to locate the protein bands which were cut from the gel. The acrylamide slices were transferred to a siliconized tubed, crushed with a pipette, and resuspended in 200 μl of 70% formic acid. Cyanogen bromide was added to a final concentration of 17 mg/ml, the samples were overlaid with argon gas, and digestion was allowed to proceed for 17 h at room temperature in the dark. Samples were microcentrifuged for 5 min, and the supernatants were transferred to siliconized tubes. The acrylamide was rinsed three times with 250 μl of ddH2O, and the rinses were combined with the digested sample. The samples were dried overnight. The peptides were electrophoresed on a 16.5%T 3%C Tris Tricine gel and visualized using a PhosphorImager. Mutating C-terminal Serine Residues to Alanine in IKKβ Does Not Alter Down-regulation of IKK Complex in MEFs—At least two regions of IKKβ are phosphorylated on serine residues in response to stimulation. Phosphorylation of T-loop serines (177 and 181) in the kinase domain of IKKβ are essential for IKK activation, and phosphorylation of at least ten serines (region spanning amino acid 664 to its end) in its C terminus was shown to play a role in down-regulation of IKK in HeLa cells in the background of endogenous IKKβ (1Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). However, because a given IKK complex could contain 6 to 9 catalytic subunits (11Miller B.S. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36320-36326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), expression of mutated forms of IKKα or IKKβ in mammalian cells could result in the formation of heterocomplexes containing endogenous wild-type along with mutated forms. For example, when kinase-defective mutants HA-IKKαKm or HA-IKKβKA were expressed in HeLa or HEK 293 cells, immunoprecipitation of the mutant kinases resulted in precipitation of very active and TNF-inducible IKK complexes (4Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). This clearly indicates that mutant IKKα or IKKβ were incorporated into the endogenous IKK complexes. Considering this, changes seen in the kinetics of IKK regulation may have been due to the formation of heterocomplexes, when the activity of the C-terminal serine to alanine mutants of IKKβ were tested in HeLa cells in the background of endogenous IKKβ (1Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Here we examined the activities of the same mutant IKKβs used in Delhase and co-workers (34Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), in embryonic fibroblasts derived from IKKβ-deficient mouse (MEFβ–/–). We generated stable pools of MEFβ–/– cells expressing either wild-type IKKβ, or M10, L3SA, or M12 mutants. In the M10 construct, 10 serines C-terminal to the helix-loop-helix are mutated to alanines, whereas the last 4 serines remained unchanged, and in the M12 construct, these same 10 serines as well as Ser740 and Ser750 are mutated to alanines. IKKβL3SA has three serines (Ser733, Ser740, and Ser750) mutated to alanines. The activities of IKK complexes were determined by the immune kinase complex assay in these cells before and"

Regni C.A. Beamer L.J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2130-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Enzymes in this family catalyze the reversible conversion of 1- to 6-phospho-sugars via a bisphosphorylated sugar intermediate. Previous studies of members of this enzyme family, including structural characterization of PMM/PGM in complex with its substrates and products (2Regni C. Naught L.E. Tipton P.A. Beamer L.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), have demonstrated that a dramatic 180° reorientation of the intermediate is necessary to complete the reaction. Although dynamic processes such as conformational changes are important to many enzymes, the reorientation of the bisphosphorylated sugar intermediate as a required step in the catalytic reaction of PMM/PGM and related enzymes is unique. The reaction of PMM/PGM, which can utilize either glucose or man-nose-based phospho-sugars as substrates, has been characterized (3Naught L.E. Gilbert S. Imhoff R. Snook C. Beamer L. Tipton P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9637-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 4Naught L.E. Regni C. Beamer L.J. Tipton P.A.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6831-6836Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and entails two phosphoryl transfer reactions (Fig. 1a). The first phosphoryl transfer proceeds from a phosphoserine residue on the enzyme to bound substrate and produces a bisphosphorylated intermediate (e.g. glucose 1,6-bisphosphate or G16P). G16P must then reorient by ∼180° to be in position for a second phosphoryl transfer, from the intermediate back to the enzyme. Recently, transient state kinetic techniques have been used to characterize the reaction of PMM/PGM (6Naught L.E. Tipton P.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6831-6836Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The non-chemical steps of the reaction (e.g. ligand binding) were found to be the rate-limiting steps of the pathway, whereas phosphoryl transfers were rapid. Single-turnover experiments show that G16P is a transient intermediate in the catalytic cycle but also indicate that it exists in two states; one that is competent to partition to substrate or product and another that is not. This has led to the suggestion that the reorientation of G16P occurs via one or more metastable states during which it is not available to proceed along the reaction pathway. In addition, an isotope trapping experiment has shown that the reorientation of G16P occurs without dissociation from the enzyme (6Naught L.E. Tipton P.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6831-6836Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and can, thus, be considered a simple example of processivity, as defined by multiple rounds of catalysis without release of substrate (7Breyer W.A. Matthews B.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Although a large number of processive enzymes has been structurally characterized, many of these systems are quite complex, often involving multiprotein complexes and large polymeric substrates, such as DNA (for review, see Ref. 7Breyer W.A. Matthews B.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In contrast, PMM/PGM, which has been well characterized both structurally and mechanistically, presents a uniquely simple system for addressing structural questions about processive reactions. For example, how does the enzyme specifically bind and maintain association with the substrate while also permitting its movement between catalytic steps? What types of interactions and structural features in the enzyme are used to accomplish this? Does conformational change of the enzyme play a role? Here we present a structural analysis of PMM/PGM in complex with its reaction intermediate G16P. Two distinct complexes, one with dephosphorylated enzyme and the other with phosphorylated enzyme, have been characterized. These two structures, which represent both a productive (on pathway) and non-productive (off pathway) complex, reveal two distinct binding positions for G16P in the active site of PMM/PGM. One of these, the non-productive complex, unexpectedly shows the intermediate bound in a position in which it appears to be partway through its reorientation in the active site. Analysis of the enzyme-intermediate interactions in these PMM/PGM-intermediate complexes followed by mutagenesis and kinetic characterization has identified several key residues that are responsible for maintaining association with the intermediate during its 180° reorientation in the active site. This work is important for understanding all members of the α-d-phosphohexomutase superfamily and the many biosynthetic reactions they catalyze. Moreover, it has implications for understanding other multistep enzymatic reactions that undergo cycles of catalysis with intervening movement of the substrate. Complex Formation and Structure Determination—Formation of the dephospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex was done using an S108D mutant; the carboxylate side chain of this residue substitutes as a ligand for the active site metal ion while simultaneously preventing phosphorylation at position 108. Initial production of the phospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex was inadvertent due to incomplete dephosphorylation of the protein sample used for crystallization. Purification and crystallization of apoPMM/PGM and the S108D mutant was carried out as previously described from 50–70% saturated sodium/potassium tartrate and 100 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5 (2Regni C. Naught L.E. Tipton P.A. Beamer L.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Regni C.A. Tipton P.A. Beamer L.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 761-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The proteins crystallized in space group P212121, with differences in the unit cell axes of less than 10% relative to wild-type protein (Table 1). This is consistent with previously characterized PMM/PGM structures that all crystallize in the same space group but show variations in cell axes depending on the form of the protein (apo, ligand-bound, or mutant).TABLE 1Crystallographic and refinement statisticsDephospho-PMM/PGM·G16PPhospho-PMM/PGM·G16PData collection X-ray sourceMBC 4.2.2SBC 19ID Space groupP212121P212121 Unit cell dimensions, Äa = 70.22a = 70.87b = 70.36b = 72.85c = 84.39c = 91.26 λ, Ä0.979090.97934 Resolution, Ä42.83-1.9050.00-2.00 Outermost shell(1.97-1.90)(2.07-2.00) Unique ref./redundancy33,583/6.533,830/8.1 Rmerge, %7.5 (34.6)7.6 (47.0) <I/σ(I)>13.9 (4.0)28.6 (3.9) Completeness, %99.9 (99.4)99.7 (100.0)Refinement statistics Resolution, Ä42.83-1.9050.00-2.00 RworkaRwork = Σ|Fo — Fc|/Σ|Fc|, where Fo and Fc are observed and calculated structure factors, respectively. / RfreebRfree is the R factor calculated from 5% of the reflections not included in refinement.

Crystals were soaked for about 15 min in the ligand solution and flash-cooled without further cryoprotection for data collection at –180 °C. Diffraction data were collected at beam line SBC 19-ID at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory (phosphoenzyme) and at beam line MBC 4.2.2 at the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (dephosphoenzyme) and processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (9Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38436) Google Scholar) or D*TREK (10Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Structure Solution and Refinement—Phases for the dephospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex were determined by molecular replacement with CNS (11Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16946) Google Scholar) using a PMM/PGM-substrate complex (1P5D) as the search model. Refinement of the phospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex began using the apoenzyme structure as a model. Refinement was carried out through iterative cycles of positional refinement using REF-MAC 5.0 (12Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) and manual rebuilding with COOT (13Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22991) Google Scholar). Five percent of the data set was set aside for cross-validation before refinement. Because of the similarity of the unit cell dimensions between the apoenzyme and phospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex (within 1%), the same reflections were tagged for cross-validation. Water molecules were placed automatically by WATPEAK (14Collaborative Computing Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19728) Google Scholar) in peaks >3.0 σ in Fo – Fc maps and within hydrogen-bonding distance of nitrogen or oxygen atoms; water molecules without electron density in 2Fo – Fc maps (contoured at 1.0 σ) and B-factors above 60 Ä2 were removed from the model. Electron density for the intermediate in both complexes appeared as a nearly continuous, 3.0-σ peak in Fo – Fc maps allowing for unambiguous placement of the ligands. However, the possibility that a small fraction of the intermediate binds in a second orientation in either complex at a level too low to appear in the electron density maps cannot be ruled out. All atoms of G16P were in electron density in the final 2Fo – Fc maps (Fig. 2, a and b). The final models (Table 1) extend from residues 9 or 10 to 463 and contain the following heteroatoms: Zn2+, G16P, waters, and phosphoserine 108 (phospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex only). The dephospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex has one residue modeled in two conformations, and the side chains of 26 residues were truncated to alanine. The phospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex has three residues modeled in two conformations, and the side chains of 33 residues were truncated to alanine. The occupancy for all residues except those modeled in multiple conformations is 1.0. The models were validated with SFCHECK (15Vaguine A.A. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

All enzymes used in activity assays were purified via Ni2+ affinity chromatography to ensure removal of contaminating proteins. Purified proteins were characterized by CD spectroscopy to determine whether gross structural changes in secondary structure resulted from the mutations. The steady state parameters for each mutant protein were quantitated as described previously (4Naught L.E. Regni C. Beamer L.J. Tipton P.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9946-9951Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), except that G16P was present at 1.0 μm instead of 0.5 μm. Briefly, the PGM activity of the enzyme was measured in the direction of glucose 6-phosphate formation using a coupled assay with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. One mutant, R20A, shows no activity under the standard assay conditions, a result that was in conflict with previously published data (4Naught L.E. Regni C. Beamer L.J. Tipton P.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9946-9951Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To confirm our data, the gene was re-sequenced, and the single-codon alteration was verified. The protein was purified twice from independent cultures. The assay was also conducted at 100-fold increased enzyme concentration and 200-fold increased G16P concentration, but activity was still not detectable. An explanation for the prior result is unknown at this time. The mutant proteins were also characterized in an isotope trapping experiment (6Naught L.E. Tipton P.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6831-6836Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that determines the rate of dissociation of G16P from the enzyme (Fig. 1b). This experiment was conducted at chemical equilibrium with 10 μm enzyme, 100 μm [14C]glucose 1-phosphate, 1.73 μm glucose 6-phosphate, 1.0 mm G16P, 1.5 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4. The ratio of the rate of transfer of label into product (kflux) and the rate of appearance of label in G16P (kdissoc) provides a direct measure of the frequency of the dissociation of the intermediate. Substrate, product, and intermediate are separated by anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography and detected and quantitated with a flow-through radioactivity detector. The full details of this method and data analysis can be found in Naught and Tipton (6Naught L.E. Tipton P.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6831-6836Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Two complexes of PMM/PGM with its reaction intermediate, G16P, have been refined to 1.9 and 2.0 Ä (see “Materials and Methods” and Table 1). One of these complexes, with dephospho-PMM/PGM, employs the site-directed mutant S108D, which prevents phosphorylation at this key residue. The other complex, with phospho-PMM/PGM, is formed using wild-type enzyme, phosphorylated at Ser-108. The dephospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex provides a snapshot of the reaction either immediately after phosphoryl transfer to the intermediate or before phosphoryl transfer back to the enzyme (Fig. 1). The phospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex, however, is an “off pathway” or non-productive complex, since in the normal course of the reaction G16P is formed only after the phosphoserine has transferred its phosphoryl group to substrate. As was done for previous studies, the enzyme rendered catalytically inactive by substituting Zn2+ is for the Mg2+ that is required for activity. In both complexes electron density maps show one molecule of G16P bound in a single specific location and orientation in the active site cleft of the monomeric enzyme (Fig. 2). Overall, the protein structures in the two PMM/PGM-intermediate complexes are quite similar to those seen in the previously characterized apoprotein and enzyme-substrate complexes (2Regni C. Naught L.E. Tipton P.A. Beamer L.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Regni C. Tipton P.A. Beamer L.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the two PMM/PGM-intermediate complexes exhibit some differences in overall tertiary structure, specifically in the rotation of domain 4 (residues 369–463) relative to the rest of the enzyme (Fig. 3a). In the dephospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex, the enzyme adopts a “closed” conformation that creates an interface between domains 1 and 4 of the protein (139 Ä2), which is absent in the apoenzyme structure. This domain-domain interaction is essential for forming the invariant phosphate-binding site, a cluster of residues originally observed in the enzyme-substrate complexes that interacts with the phosphate group of each phospho-sugar ligand in the same fashion regardless of the position (1 versus 6) of the substitution (2Regni C. Naught L.E. Tipton P.A. Beamer L.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because of the closed conformation of domain 4, G16P is buried deeply in the active site of this complex, with only 7% of its surface area accessible to solvent. The intermediate adopts an extended conformation and spans the active site of the enzyme with its 1-phosphate group adjacent to residue 108 (the conserved phosphoryl transfer site), whereas its 6-phosphate group occupies the phosphate-binding site. Thus, G16P in this complex is appropriately positioned for phosphoryl transfer from the 1-phosphate group to residue 108 of the enzyme to form glucose 6-phosphate. Relative to the dephospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex, the complex of phospho-PMM/PGM with G16P exhibits a number of significant structural differences (Fig. 3b). For instance, the enzyme adopts a “half-open” conformation, where the rotation of domain 4 is midway between that observed in the open apoenzyme structure and the closed dephospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex. Because of this, the phospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex has only a small interface between domains 1 and 4 (67 Ä2), and also lacks an intact phosphate-binding site. Furthermore, steric conflicts with phosphoserine 108 prevent the intermediate from binding as deeply in the active site; more than 25% of the surface area of G16P is exposed to solvent. The conformation of G16P is more compact than that observed in the dephospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex; rotation about the C6–06 bond reduces the distance between the centers of the phosphate groups from 7.7 to 6.9 Ä. As seen in the dephospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex, G16P is also bound in a single orientation in this structure. However, its relative orientation in the active site is reversed: the 6-phosphate group is closest to residue 108, whereas the 1-phosphate group occupies a perturbed version of the phosphate-binding site in domain 4. Dephospho-PMM/PGM·G16P Complex—In this structure multiple specific interactions are observed between the protein and G16P, involving residues from all four domains of the enzyme (Fig. 3c and Table 2). Interactions between the 6-phosphate group and residues in the phosphate-binding site include hydrogen bonds from both side chain and backbone atoms of the protein. In the phosphoryl transfer site, the 1-phosphate group is contacted by several side chains, including those of the ionizable residues Lys-118, His-308, His-329, and Arg-247. Hydroxyl groups on the sugar ring of G16P form hydrogen bonds with residues in domains 1–3 of the protein, including Glu-325 and Ser-327, which make similar contacts in the enzyme-substrate complexes (2Regni C. Naught L.E. Tipton P.A. Beamer L.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Only four solvent molecules contact the intermediate in this structure; two of these make bridging interactions between the protein and G16P. In many ways the dephospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex resembles the previously characterized enzyme-substrate complexes (2Regni C. Naught L.E. Tipton P.A. Beamer L.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Structural superpositions (data not shown) show that phosphate groups of the ligands that occupy the phosphate-binding site have essentially identical environments. Also, the sugar rings of the intermediate and substrates overlap at least partially but not as closely as the phosphate groups. Not surprisingly, nearly all of the residues that contact G16P in the dephospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex were previously observed to interact with a ligand in one or more of the enzyme-substrate complexes. The single exception to this is a new interaction observed near the phosphoryl transfer site, between Lys-118 and the 1-phosphate group of G16P. Phospho-PMM/PGM·G16P Complex—Despite what appears to be a quasi-stable binding position, a number of specific protein-ligand interactions are also observed in the phospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex (Fig. 3d and Table 2). Many of these are between the two phosphate groups of G16P and basic residues of the enzyme, including Arg-15, Arg-20, and Arg-421. Presumably, these basic side chains help neutralize the abundance of negative charge in the vicinity of the 6-phosphate group of G16P, which is relatively close to phosphoserine 108 (P-P distance 6.9 Ä). The 1-phosphate group of the intermediate occupies a perturbed version of the phosphate-binding site but lacks the otherwise conserved interaction with Tyr-17 of domain 1 and also differs in the number and geometry of the hydrogen bond contacts relative to the enzyme-substrate and dephospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complexes. Only a single direct enzyme contact is made to a sugar hydroxyl of G16P by the side chain of Ser-327. Instead, most hydrogen bonds with the sugar hydroxyls are made by water molecules. Of the 10 water molecules in the active site, 8 form hydrogen bonds to hydroxyl groups of the sugar ring; 4 waters bridge between G16P and side chain or backbone atoms of the protein. In contrast to the complex of dephospho-PMM/PGM with G16P, many of the interactions in the phospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex are not observed in other PMM/PGM-ligand structures. Four of the contacting residues, Arg-15, Arg-20, His-109, and Asn-110, make no interactions with ligands in the dephospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex or any of the enzyme-substrate complexes. Indeed, the side chains of two of these residues, Arg-15 and Arg-20, are partially disordered with high B-factors and/or adopt multiple conformations in other PMM/PGM ligand complexes but are found in single, well defined conformations in this complex with G16P (Fig. 2b). Several of these residues (Arg-20, His-109, and Asn-110) are conserved throughout the α-d-phosphohexomutase family (1Shackelford G.S. Regni C.A. Beamer L.J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2130-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting key roles in enzyme function. Structural analysis of the two PMM/PGM-intermediate complexes raised questions about the functional roles of residues interacting with G16P. To further investigate this, site-directed mutants were created and characterized mechanistically. Residues at various locations in the active site of the enzyme were selected for mutagenesis, including three that make unique contacts in the phospho-PMM/PGM·G16P complex (Arg-15, Arg-20, Asn-110), one involved in the phosphate-binding site (Arg-421), and another residue (Arg-247) with no known role in catalysis. Selected residues were changed to alanine, except for the R421C mutant that was available from previous studies. CD spectroscopy showed no differences in secondary structure between wild-type and mutant proteins. The kinetic properties of the mutant PMM/PGM proteins are summarized in Table 3. Steady state kinetic parameters for each protein were determined, and an isotope trapping experiment was conducted to characterize the frequency of dissociation of G16P from the enzyme during catalysis (see “Materials and Methods”). This experiment is performed at chemical equilibrium using [14C]glucose 1-phosphate as substrate and measures the transfer of label to product in the presence of excess unlabeled G16P (Fig. 1b). Under these conditions dissociation of labeled G16P is essentially irreversible, and thus, the appearance of label in G16P measures the rate of its dissociation from enzyme. In the case of wild-type PMM/PGM, this experiment showed that G16P proceeds directly to product 14.3 times more often than it dissociates from the enzyme (6Naught L.E. Tipton P.A.

Improper localization of ERK1/2 has been found in certain cancers, highlighting the importance of elucidating the mechanisms regulating their localization. 4S. Muneer, M. H. Cobb, and J. D.

Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) first observed that inactive ERK2 is present in the cytoplasm of resting cells and that upon stimulation, a fraction of total ERK2 accumulates in the nucleus; similar observations were subsequently reported by others with ERK1 and ERK2 (2Lenormand P.

Microinjection of thiophosphorylated ERK2 (thio-pERK2) into the cytoplasm of REF52 cells resulted in its rapid translocation to the nucleus (5Khokhlatchev A. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J.L. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), suggesting that activation of ERK2 is sufficient for its nuclear localization. In support of this finding, inhibition of ERK2 phosphorylation by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 reduced ERK2 nuclear localization (6Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Activation of ERK1/2 does not ensure their nuclear localization. Endogenous inactive ERK1/2 are also found in the nucleus, and active ERK1/2 are observed in the cytoplasm (7Cheng M. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8951-8958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Menice C.B. Hulvershorn J. Adam L.P. Wang C.A. Morgan K.G. J. Biol.

Microinjection of unphosphorylated ERK2 into the cytoplasm of fibroblasts led to its nuclear localization within 2 min and redistribution to the cytoplasm by 5–10 min, suggesting that ERK2 can rapidly enter and exit the nucleus in unstimulated cells (5Khokhlatchev A.

Overexpressed inactive ERK2 accumulates in the nucleus and has been used to assay for factors that promote cytoplasmic retention (10Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol.

These later findings suggest that nuclear localization of ERK1/2 can be uncoupled from their activation. Import reconstitution assays with unphosphorylated ERK2 showed that ERK2 enters the nucleus by an energy- and carrier-independent facilitated mechanism (12Matsubayashi Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J.

Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Direct interactions with nuclear pore proteins were inferred from pull-down assays. More recently, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was used to confirm the energy-independent movement of ERK2 into the nucleus (14Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3832-3837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer demonstrated that ERK2 interacts with MEK1 in the cytoplasm. This finding supports earlier suggestions that MEK1 is involved in cytoplasmic anchoring of ERK2 (15Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 16Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ERK2 releases it from a MEK1 complex, presumably increasing the free pool of ERK2 available to enter the nucleus by the facilitated, energy-independent mechanism. Together these studies suggest an important role for anchoring proteins including MEK1 in the subcellular redistribution of ERK2. In addition to cytoplasmic anchoring, MEK1 has been proposed to cause nuclear export of ERK2. MEK1 has a nuclear export sequence (NES) that enables its export via the export receptor CRM1 (16Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A MEK1 mutant in which the NES was disrupted caused nuclear retention of microinjected ERK2, whereas wild-type MEK1 enhanced cytoplasmic localization of ERK2 (16Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, it was proposed that inactive ERK2 can be exported from the nucleus by association with MEK1. Leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of CRM1-mediated export, reduced loss of ERK2 from the nucleus, suggesting that ERK2 export is CRM1- and energy-dependent. Several studies have shown that the localizations of ERK2 and MEK1 are sensitive to LMB (9Whitehurst A.W. Cobb M.H. White M.A. Mol. Cell.

Because the dually phosphorylated form of ERK2 does not bind MEK1, it was suggested that the active form of ERK2 is not exported from the nucleus (17Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the behavior of MEK1 is consistent with a role in ERK1/2 export. MEK1 has been found primarily in the cytoplasm of cells. Disabling its NES causes its nuclear accumulation, suggesting that it shuttles between the two compartments (17Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E.

Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3742-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, no significant translocation of MEK1 into the nucleus has been detected upon stimulation (14Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3832-3837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Zheng C.-F. Guan K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19947-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the question remains as to whether quantities of MEK1 that enter the nucleus or the kinetics of its entry or exit are sufficient to drive ERK2 export. In aggregate, these studies suggest that there is continuous nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of the free pool of ERK2 by facilitated diffusion. The active form binds to proteins in the nucleus and, as a consequence, is less readily exported. Anchoring ERK2 in different compartments of the cell determines the size of the pool available for relocalization. We analyzed import and export in separate reconstitution assays to gain further insight into the mechanisms of ERK2 nuclear transport. Our results identify additional regulated events that must be added to the current model.

As indicated, cells were treated with 10–20 nm (5.5–11 ng/ml) LMB (LC Laboratories) for 4–6 h prior to use in import assays. Serum was removed for 2 h prior to use in import assays with thio-pERK2. RNAi—CRM1 expression was reduced with RNAi as described (24Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). Small interfering RNA oligonucleotides generated toward three CRM1 sequences (CRM1-1, 5′-ATACGTTGTTGGCCTCATT-3′; CRM1-2, 5′-ATATGTTGTTGGTATCTGA-3′; CRM1-3, 5′-TTACTCATCTGGATTATGT-3′) and toward WNK4 were synthesized by the UT Southwestern core facility. HeLa cells were grown on coverslips to 30–50% confluence as above but without antibiotics. 100 nm CRM1-1, CRM1-2, or CRM1-3 double-stranded-RNA oligonucleotides were added, and cells were grown for 24 h. In some cases, a second transfection with 100 nm oligonucleotide was performed. Cells were harvested after an additional 12–24 h. Aliquots of cell lysates were immunoblotted with the CRM1 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) or ERK1/2 antibody (25Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) to verify that CRM1 expression was reduced without affecting ERK1/2 expression. Import and Export Assays—Import assays were performed as described before (13Whitehurst A.W. Wilsbacher J.L. You Y. Luby-Phelps K. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and export assays were according to Ref. 26Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar. In each experiment, duplicate coverslips were examined under all conditions. Unless otherwise indicated, experiments were performed at least three times. Cells were washed in transport buffer (TB) (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol), once unless otherwise specified, and permeabilized with 70 μg/ml digitonin in TB for 5 min. The import reaction was performed in a 40-μl reaction mix that contained one or more of the following components as specified in the figure legends: TB with 10 mg/ml BSA; 0.8 μm recombinant substrate (GFP-ERK2 or thio-pERK2); 0.14 μm TRITC-NLS-BSA; HeLa cell cytosol dialyzed against TB (2.5 mg/ml or as specified); energy-(ATP/GTP regenerating system consisting of 1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 5 mm phosphocreatine, and 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase); 4 units of apyrase; 0.5 mg/ml wheat germ agglutinin (WGA); and recombinant transport factors kapα2 (0.5 μm), kapβ1 (0.25 μm), Ran (2 μm), and p10/NTF2 (0.4 μm). Import was for 15 min unless otherwise specified and was terminated with 0.25 ml of TB. Cells were fixed or used for export assays. For export assays, cells that had been preincubated with import substrate were transferred to a 40-μl reaction mix that contained TB with 10 mg/ml BSA and one or more of the following as specified in the figure legends: cytosol, energy, WGA, or apyrase at the same concentrations as above. Export was for 30 min unless otherwise specified. The reaction was terminated with 0.25 ml of TB. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and coverslips were mounted using Aqua PolyMount (Polysciences, Inc.). For indirect immunofluorescence, fixed cells were repermeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Blocking was performed in PBTA (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mg/ml BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. The pERK1/2 antibody (Sigma) was used at 1:300 for 24 h at 4 °C, and the Alexa Fluor 546 anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was used at 1:3000 or the MEK1 or MEK2 antibodies, A2227 or A2228 (22Xu S. Robbins D. Frost J. Dang A. Lange-Carter C. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6808-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) were used at 1:300 for 24 h at 4 °C, and the Alexa Fluor 546 anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was used at 1:3000 for 1 h at room temperature. Washes between the incubations were performed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline or 1× PBTA for 15 min at room temperature. Fluorescence Microscopy—GFP, TRITC, and Alexa Fluor fluorophores were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus microscope, and images were acquired using a Hamamatsu digital CCD camera (C4742-95). Exposures for all conditions within an experiment were constant, and fluorescence intensity within the nucleus was quantified using Slidebook 4.1 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc.). Characterization of ERK2 Export—The mechanism of ERK2 export from the nucleus has not been thoroughly examined. ERK2 has no identifiable NES, but a CRM1-dependent nuclear export process has been reported based on sensitivity to LMB (17Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, one study indicated that ERK2 was exported in the absence of transport factors and energy, suggesting that export of ERK2 may not be mediated via CRM1 (12Matsubayashi Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41755-41760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To explore mechanisms of ERK2 export, an export reconstitution assay was performed following import of a GFP-tagged fusion protein of ERK2 in permeabilized BJ fibroblasts and HeLa cells. BJ fibroblasts behave like primary human foreskin fibroblasts in that the nuclear accumulation of ERK1/2 occurs only in response to certain stimuli (9Whitehurst A.W. Cobb M.H. White M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10145-10150Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because import of unphosphorylated GFP-ERK2 into nuclei of permeabilized cells occurs in an energy- and carrier-independent manner, GFP-ERK2 was allowed to accumulate in the nucleus for 15 min without the addition of cytosol or an ATP/GTP regenerating system (energy). The cells were then incubated for different times in transport buffer with an ATP/GTP-regenerating system (+E) either without (–C) or with (+C) cytosol as a source of transport factors. The amount of GFP-ERK2 remaining in the nucleus was detected by fluorescence microscopy. Reduced nuclear fluorescence from GFP-ERK2 in BJ fibroblasts (Fig. 1A) or HeLa cells (Fig. 1B) was detected as early as 5 min under both conditions. Quantification of fluorescence intensity in three independent experiments with BJ cells indicated ∼85% export by 30 min in the presence of cytosol and energy (Fig. 1C). Longer incubations resulted in little additional export. GFP-ERK2 was intact at the end of the export time course as assessed by incubation with permeabilized cells for up to 45 min (data not shown). In the absence of cytosol and energy, less export is detected (Fig. 1C). Experiments with thio-pERK2 indicate that it is also exported in the absence of cytosol and energy (data not shown). Rhodamine-labeled NLS-BSA was used as the model import substrate. It is imported via the conventional import mechanism in an energy- and cytosol-dependent manner and, as expected, was not exported from nuclei of BJ cells under the conditions used even after 2 h (Fig. 1D and data not shown). To determine whether loss of GFP-ERK2, a 68-kDa protein, from the nucleus is through the nuclear pore complex, we performed an export experiment with GFP-ERK2 in which WGA was added after the initial import period. WGA blocks nuclear transport through the nuclear pore complex by binding to carbohydrate moieties on nucleoporins (27Finlay D.R. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1990; 60: 17-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The addition of WGA blocked loss of GFP-ERK2 from the nucleus (Fig. 2). This confirms that GFP-ERK2 is being exported through the nuclear pore complex and that our conditions of permeabilization do not grossly damage the nuclear membrane. Export of GFP-ERK2 Occurs by Two Distinguishable Processes—We observed significant export of GFP-ERK2 in the absence of cytosol and energy, suggesting that export can occur by a passive process much like the import process characterized previously. We also observed increased export in the presence of energy and cytosol, suggesting that there may be more than one export mechanism (Fig. 1, A–C). To characterize the energy and carrier dependence of export further, we performed the export assay using GFP-ERK2 in BJ fibroblasts in the presence or absence of cytosolic factors or energy. After 30 min, little fluorescence in the nucleus was detected when both cytosol and energy were present in the export mix (Fig. 3). The absence of energy, i.e. no exogenously added ATP/GTP-regenerating system or the inclusion of apyrase to scavenge nucleotides, reduced export. The absence of cytosolic factors also reduced export, although to a lesser extent. We obtained similar results in HeLa cells (data not shown), indicating that this is not a cell type-specific event. We tested the effects of varying cytosol concentration and found a minimal effect. At 0.5 mg/ml cytosol, export was inhibited ∼20%; this effect was reversed as cytosol concentration was further increased (data not shown). Export of GFP-ERK2 by the Energy-dependent Process Is Mediated by CRM1—CRM1 mediates energy-dependent transport of many cargo proteins from the nucleus (28Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Because there is an energy/cytosol dependence of export of GFP-ERK2, we examined the involvement of CRM1 in this process. We knocked down the expression of CRM1 using RNA interference in HeLa cells. Expression of CRM1 was reduced from 75 to 90% in four experiments (Fig. 4A). We observed inhibition of export at 15 and 30 min in cells transfected with double-stranded RNA targeting CRM1 (Fig. 4, B and C, labeled CRM1 RNAi (+) and – (control) respectively). Quantification of the fluorescence intensity in the nucleus showed ∼30% inhibition at 15 min and a maximum of 45% at 30 min. RNAi with oligonucleotides that suppress expression of the protein kinase WNK4 had no effect on export of ERK2 (data not shown). CRM1 RNAi neither significantly altered the import of GFP-ERK2 (Fig. 4, B and C) nor did it affect the amount of NLS-BSA in the nucleus under import or export conditions (Fig. 4, D and E). CRM1-mediated export should be dependent on a source of Ran-GTP, provided by the cytosol, as well as an energy regeneration system to provide GTP. Thus, export was also performed in the absence of cytosol and energy to determine whether these components were required for the export we detected (Fig. 4F). Consistent with a role for CRM1 in the energy-dependent export of GFP-ERK2, little or no inhibition of energy-independent export was evident under these conditions. Finally, we performed export assays with GFP-ERK2 in HeLa cells treated with 10 or 20 nm LMB for 4–6 h. We observed a maximum of 50% inhibition of export (with cytosol and energy) at 30 min after treatment with LMB (+LMB), as compared with export lacking LMB (–LMB) (Fig. 5, A and B). Neither import nor export carried out in the absence of cytosol and energy were affected by LMB (Fig. 5, A and B), consistent with the results of CRM1 RNAi. NLS-BSA was used as the nuclear localized control, and no effect of LMB on its localization was observed during the import or export process (Fig. 5, C and D). Export of ERK2 Occurs Even with Impaired MEK1 Binding—Several experiments were performed to characterize the actions of MEK1 on this system. The addition of an equimolar amount of recombinant MEK1 to the import mixture reduced the import of GFP-ERK2 (Fig. 6A). Because this occurred rapidly and in the absence of added transport factors, the reduced nuclear staining is probably due to inhibition of import rather than enhanced export. In the absence of added exogenous MEK1, immunofluorescent staining of the washed permeabilized HeLa cells after import of GFP-ERK2 revealed a significant amount of endogenous MEK1 and MEK2 (Fig. 6B) in the nuclei. MEK1 and MEK2 were largely retained in HeLa nuclei following export of GFP-ERK2 in the presence of cytosol and energy (Fig. 6B). A comparable experiment in BJ fibroblasts also showed detectable nuclear MEK1 and MEK2 but suggested that MEK1 was more readily lost from BJ cell nuclei during the time necessary for export (data not shown). We also examined export of an ERK2 mutant Y261N that is impaired in binding to MEK1 and has been shown to accumulate in nuclei of transfected cells (11Robinson F.L. Whitehurst A.W. Raman M. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This mutant was imported, albeit more slowly than wild-type ERK2. 5M. N. Yazicioglu, A. Ranganathan, and M. H. Cobb, manuscript in preparation. Its export was not significantly different from that of wild-type ERK2. Phosphorylated ERK2 Can Enter the Nucleus in the Absence of Transport Factors and Energy via the Nuclear Pore Complex—We previously showed that thio-pERK2 competes for import with GFP-ERK2 and NLS-BSA, in the absence of cytosolic factors and energy (13Whitehurst A.W. Wilsbacher J.L. You Y. Luby-Phelps K. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These experiments suggest a similarity in the mechanism of import of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated ERK2. Studies in intact cells suggested that phosphorylation promoted ERK2 import (5Khokhlatchev A. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J.L. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar); this finding was interpreted to suggest that ERK2 enters the nucleus via an active import mechanism. Thus, we also investigated the mechanism of entry of phosphorylated ERK2 into the nucleus using import reconstitution assays. To examine import, BJ cells were permeabilized and incubated in the import mixture for 20 min in the presence or absence of recombinant transport factors (TF) and energy. To reduce any endogenous phosphorylated ERK2, cells were starved for 2 h prior to permeabilization and/or washed in transport buffer prior to the addition of thio-pERK2. Thio-phosphorylated proteins are more resistant to dephosphorylation than phospho-proteins (5Khokhlatchev A. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J.L. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Thus, thio-pERK2 was used as the import substrate. Import of thio-pERK2 was detected with an anti pERK1/2 anti-body. Thio-pERK2 was imported without the addition of transport factors or energy; however, its uptake was substantially enhanced in the presence of recombinant factors and energy (Fig. 7A). WGA blocked entry of thio-pERK2 into the nucleus (Fig. 7A, top right). Rhodamine-labeled NLS-BSA was not imported in the absence of energy (Fig. 7B) or in the presence of WGA (data not shown). Import of Thio-pERK2 Occurs Predominantly by an Energy-dependent Process—Because we observed an increase in thio-pERK2 import with the addition of recombinant transport factors and energy, we determined whether the presence of energy affected nuclear uptake in the absence of added transport factors. A dramatic increase in nuclear import of thio-pERK2 was observed when energy was included in the import mixture (Fig. 7C). It seems likely that this effect depends on residual transport factors that remain following permeabilization. In support of this interpretation, the addition of transport factors did not further enhance uptake (not shown). To confirm that the increase in fluorescence intensity within the nucleus was not due to phosphorylation of endogenous ERK2 in the presence of energy, permeabilized cells were incubated in the import mixture with an energy regeneration system without thio-pERK2. No fluorescence above background was observed (Fig. 7C, far right). We also performed import assays in the presence of WGA. WGA blocked most of the fluorescence seen in the nucleus in the presence of energy (Fig. 7C). This suggests that, in addition to an energy- and carrier-independent import process, thio-pERK2 also utilizes an energy-dependent mechanism for nuclear translocation not detected for unphosphorylated ERK2 using this same assay system (13Whitehurst A.W. Wilsbacher J.L. You Y. Luby-Phelps K. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). From the difference in nuclear uptake observed, the energy-dependent process appears to be the predominant mechanism. Phosphorylated ERK2 Can Exit the Nucleus in the Absence of Transport Factors and Energy—We examined the export of thio-pERK2 in the absence of energy and cytosol. Thio-pERK2 was exported from the nucleus in the absence of transport factors or energy-regenerating capacity (Fig. 8, A and B), indicating that phosphorylation alone is insufficient to retain ERK2 in the nucleus. Incubation of thio-pERK2 with cytosol for 30 min did not significantly reduce its immunoreactivity with pERK1/2 antibodies (Fig. 8C). Thus, dephosphorylation of thio-pERK2 by cytosolic phosphoprotein phosphatases was not the cause of loss of thio-pERK2 in export assays. We have used import and export assays in permeabilized cells to evaluate mechanisms of ERK2 entry into and exit from the nucleus. Much of the previous work directed at understanding these processes employed overexpressed proteins that may behave differently from endogenous proteins or small molecule inhibitors that may block the functions of unrelated components in the cell. The following model best captures the current findings with ERK2 and is likely to apply also to ERK1. ERK2 in the unphosphorylated state enters the nucleus by an energy-independent mechanism facilitated by direct interaction with nucleoporins (12Matsubayashi Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41755-41760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Whitehurst A.W. Wilsbacher J.L. You Y. Luby-Phelps K. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). An effect of transport factors and energy has not been detected, suggesting that this is the primary entry mechanism for the unphosphorylated protein. Entry is very rapid in reconstitution assays and as reported using photobleaching in intact cells (14Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3832-3837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Proteins that bind ERK2 in the cytosol inhibit its entry by tethering it at sites distant from the nuclear membrane or, like PEA-15, by blocking its ability to interact with nucleoporins (18Whitehurst A.W. Robinson F.L. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12840-12847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ERK2 can also exit the nucleus by an energy-independent process as suggested previously (12Matsubayashi Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41755-41760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), presumably by the same nucleoporin-mediated mechanism. Thus, there is a constant exchange of ERK2 between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In the case of export, a second process dependent on energy and transport factors including CRM1 also exists. Like unphosphorylated ERK2, phosphorylated ERK2 can enter and exit the nucleus by an energy- and carrier-independent mechanism. However, a significant component of entry of phosphorylated ERK2 requires energy. Energy appears to increase the rate and extent of nuclear uptake. This process presumably promotes the nuclear uptake of active ERK2 selectively over the unphosphorylated form. Interactions specific for the phosphorylated form of ERK2 would then be expected to enhance retention of the active form in the nucleus. The factors required to mediate the steps we have identified are present in unstimulated cells following permeabilization. Residual amounts of transport proteins are present, but factors that are dependent on stimulation, due to either covalent modification or induction, are not required for these processes. Additional regulation is expected to be introduced under stimulated conditions. Active ERK2 binds kinetochores, topoisomerase II, and many transcription factors, as well as an unidentified newly synthesized protein (6Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 29Zecevic M. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Renzi L. Hittle J.C. Yen T.J. Gorbsky G.J. Weber M.J. J.

Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), all of which may serve to sequester active ERK2 from the readily exchanging pool. Energy-dependent import mediated via importins requires direct binding of cargo proteins through their NLS to import factors. ERK2 has no obvious NLS. Thus, as for export, the energy-dependent process of import of phosphorylated ERK2 may be mediated by binding to other NLS-containing proteins; phosphorylation of ERK2 would be expected to enhance interaction with such proteins. It is also possible that phosphorylation unmasks an otherwise silent NLS in ERK2. The energy-dependent component of ERK2 export is mediated, at least in part, by CRM1. Thus far, we have been unable to show any direct interaction between ERK2 and CRM1 (data not shown). It is possible that binding of ERK2 to other karyopherin-β family members bypasses the need for an NES. There is precedent for direct interactions of MAPKs with transport factors. The Drosophila ERK (D-ERK) binds to the homolog of importin7 (DIM-7) (32Lorenzen J.A. Baker S.E. Denhez F. Melnick M.B. Brower D.L. Perkins L.A. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 1403-1414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the yeast p38 MAPK HOG1 binds to a karyopherin-β family member, NMD5 (33Ferrigno P. Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5606-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). It seems more likely that ERK2, which lacks a recognizable NES, requires binding to other NES-containing proteins to be exported via the classical export machinery. One such protein is MEK1. Our results support a role for MEK1 as a cytoplasmic anchor, as originally proposed (15Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), but do not yet provide a clear picture of its significance in ERK2 export. MEK1 is present in the nuclei of permeabilized cells and might participate in the active export process as it has a leucine-rich NES and is exported via CRM1. Our results suggest that MEK1 does not enter the nucleus readily when complexed to ERK2, nor is it apparently exported as readily as is ERK2 in the presence of energy and cytosolic factors. Reduced MEK1 binding does not detectably decrease ERK2 export. Nevertheless, these findings are insufficient to rule out a role for MEK1 in the CRM1-dependent component of ERK2 export. In summary, we have shown that active ERK2 enters the nucleus by two processes; one is energy-dependent, and the other is energy-independent. The energy-dependent process is enhanced by transport factors. The energy-independent process is facilitated by interaction of ERK2 with nucleoporins. Two processes, one energy-dependent and one energy-independent, also appear to mediate export of ERK2 from the nucleus. It seems likely that differential regulation of these processes would be sufficient to achieve a range of stimulus-induced localizations such as have been reported in different cell types in response to different ligands.

https://openalex.org/W2017314817,"Slithering from the mouth of this frog is a gordian or horsehair worm. The adult worms are free-living but juvenile forms are parasites in the bodies of insects such as the cricket. Most parasites would be doomed if their host was eaten, but not this worm, which almost always escapes by the obvious route. A laboratory study of the efficiency of this survival strategy shows just how effective it is, though the escape needs to be executed within five minutes if it is to succeed. As prisoners in their living habitat, parasites should be vulnerable to destruction by the predators of their hosts. But we show here that the parasitic gordian worm Paragordius tricuspidatus is able to escape not only from its insect host after ingestion by a fish or frog but also from the digestive tract of the predator. This remarkable tactic enables the worm to continue its life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2083106618,"The unique feature of rod photoreceptor cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) is the presence of inhibitory subunits (Pγ), which interact with the catalytic heterodimer (Pαβ) to regulate its activity. This uniqueness results in an extremely high sensitivity and sophisticated modulations of rod visual signaling where the Pγ/Pαβ interactions play a critical role. The quaternary organization of the αβγγ heterotetramer is poorly understood and contradictory patterns of interaction have been previously suggested. Here we provide evidence that supports a specific interaction, by systematically and differentially analyzing the Pγ-binding regions on Pα and Pβ through photolabel transfer from various Pγ positions throughout the entire molecule. The Pγ N-terminal Val16–Phe30 region was found to interact with the Pαβ GAFa domain, whereas its C terminus (Phe73–Ile87) interacted with the Pαβ catalytic domain. The interactions of Pγ with these two domains were bridged by its central Ser40–Phe50 region through interactions with GAFb and the linker between GAFb and the catalytic domain, indicating a linear and extended interaction between Pγ and Pαβ. Furthermore, a photocross-linked product αβγ(γ) was specifically generated by the double derivatized Pγ, in which one photoprobe was located in the polycationic region and the other in the C terminus. Taken together the evidence supports the conclusion that each Pγ molecule binds Pαβ in an extended linear interaction and may even interact with both Pα and Pβ simultaneously. The unique feature of rod photoreceptor cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) is the presence of inhibitory subunits (Pγ), which interact with the catalytic heterodimer (Pαβ) to regulate its activity. This uniqueness results in an extremely high sensitivity and sophisticated modulations of rod visual signaling where the Pγ/Pαβ interactions play a critical role. The quaternary organization of the αβγγ heterotetramer is poorly understood and contradictory patterns of interaction have been previously suggested. Here we provide evidence that supports a specific interaction, by systematically and differentially analyzing the Pγ-binding regions on Pα and Pβ through photolabel transfer from various Pγ positions throughout the entire molecule.

Phototransduction in vertebrate rod photoreceptor cells features an extremely high sensitivity of “one photon” response and a quick recovery facilitated by complex regulatory mechanisms (1Arshavsky V.Y.

In accordance with these features, rod phosphodiesterase (PDE6), 2The abbreviations used are: PDE6, rod photoreceptor cGMP phosphodiesterase; Pαβ, PDE6 catalytic heterodimer; nPαβ, Pαβ heterodimer nicked at Lys147 and/or Lys146 on Pβ by trypsin treatment; tPβ, truncated Pβ with 147 amino acids removed from the N terminus; GAF, a domain derived from cGMP phosphodiesterases, adenylyl cyclases, and the E. coli protein Fh1A; Pγ, PDE6 inhibitory subunit; BBM, 2-[Na-benzoylbenzoicamido-N6-(6-biotinamidocaproyl)-l-lysinyamido]ethyl methanethiosulfonate; FAzB, 2-[N2-(4-azido-2,3,5,6,-tetrafluorobenzoyl)-N6-(6-biotinamidocaproyl)-l-lysinyl]-ethyl methanethiosulfonate; mBP, 4-(N-maleimido)benzophenone; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid; Clos, clostripain; Throm, thrombin; Gen, Genenase I; DTT, dithiothreitol; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. a nearly perfect effector enzyme in amplifying visual signal (1Arshavsky V.Y.

Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), is unique among the phosphodiesterase families not only for its heterodimer (Pαβ) formed by the catalytic subunits, but also for its two identical inhibitory subunits (Pγ) that strictly regulate the PDE6 activity (2Cote R.H. Bradshaw R.A. Dennis E.A. Handbook of Cell Signaling. Academic Press, San Diego2003: 453-458Google Scholar, 3Beavo J.A. Physiol.

In the dark state Pγ binds Pαβ tightly to keep the holoenzyme inactivated. Upon light activation Pγ is displaced from the catalytic sites of Pαβ by the activated transducin α subunit to relieve the cGMP hydrolysis activity of Pαβ. The lowered cGMP level leads to transfer of the visual signal to the brain and thus results in vision. Meanwhile, the displaced Pγ is an important component of the GTPase accelerating protein complex, which effectively terminates the visual signal (1Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ feedback loop that restores cGMP levels and the reciprocal action of cGMP/Pγ have been suggested to result in rebinding of Pγ to Pαβ (5Burns M.E. Mendez A. Chen J. Baylor D.A. Neuron. 2002; 36: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 6Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol.

Biosci. 2005; 10: 1191-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), thus preparing the phosphodiesterase for the next round of photoexcitation. Whereas the exceptionally tight binding of Pγ with Pαβ (Kd < 1pm) maintains a very low visual background in rod cells, the efficient dissociation and re-association of Pγ/Pαβ is critical for a quick photoresponse and recovery (1Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 2Cote R.H. Bradshaw R.A. Dennis E.A. Handbook of Cell Signaling.

Interplay of these regulatory processes contributes to the superior sensitivity of rod phototransduction (1Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Therefore, association and dissociation of Pγ with the Pαβ heterodimer play a critical role in visual signal transduction, and the manner by which Pγ interacts with Pαβ is a critically important issue for elucidating the visual signaling mechanisms. Furthermore, the disruption of Pγ/Pαβ interaction leads to night blindness and retinal degeneration (8Bowes C. Li T. Danciger M. Baxter L.C. Applebury M.L. Farber D.B.

However, the structural aspects of Pγ/Pαβ interaction remain elusive so far due to limited structural information. Electron microscopy studies on bovine rod PDE6 have revealed the dimeric association of the two catalytic subunits and three distinct domains in each subunit, the tandem GAF domains (13Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) at the N-terminal side and the catalytic domain at the C terminus (14Kameni Tcheudji J.F.

Mayanagi K. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 139: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), yet how Pγ binds to Pαβ remains unresolved. The recent crystal structure of GAF domains of a related PDE family member, mouse PDE2, revealed the atomic details of the GAF homodimer (16Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S.

The crystal structures of single catalytic domains of PDE4, PDE5, and PDE9 have also been solved (17Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J. Milburn M.V.

Whereas these electron microscopy derived and crystal structures provide useful information for producing a speculative structure for PDE6, none of these studies has revealed a quaternary organization of the two inhibitory γ subunits with the catalytic Pαβ heterodimer of rod PDE6. Previous studies through molecular biology and biochemistry have made remarkable contributions to understanding the Pαβ/Pγ interactions (2Cote R.H. Bradshaw R.A. Dennis E.A.

Two major Pαβ-interacting regions on Pγ have been identified: the polycationic region that provides the major binding energy with Pαβ, and the C-terminal region that imposes inhibition on the catalytic site of Pαβ (2Cote R.H.

In stark contrast, however, only limited knowledge has been gained about the Pγ-interacting sites on Pαβ because this analysis is particularly difficult. Heterologous expression and mutagenesis of the αβ catalytic heterodimer with high activity has not been successful thus far (26Piriev N.I. Yamashita C. Samuel G. Farber D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9340-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Qin N. Baehr W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3265-3271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28White J.B. Thompson W.J.

For this reason, PDE6 activity assays using native Pαβ have been a popular approach for the study of Pγ/Pαβ interactions (4Artemyev N.O. Arshavsky V.Y. Cote R.H.

Using functional assay approaches, however, it has been difficult to gain information about Pγ-interacting regions on Pαβ, particularly differential interactions of Pγ/Pα and Pγ/Pβ, because the activity of Pαβ is lost once Pα and Pβ are either separated or dissected. We therefore employed an advantageous photolabel transfer approach in this study to map Pγ-interacting regions on Pα and Pβ thus providing insights into the quaternary organization of the PDE6 subunits. A model of linear Pγ/Pαβ interaction has been previously suggested (4Artemyev N.O. Arshavsky V.Y. Cote R.H. Methods. 1998; 14: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 33Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19964-19969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which is supported by the studies that identified a site in the Pα GAFa domain interacting with N-terminal position 23 on Pγ (34Muradov K.G. Granovsky A.E. Schey K.L. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3884-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and a binding region of the Pγ C terminus in the Pα catalytic domain (35Artemyev N.O. Natochin M. Busman M. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5407-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41258-41262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, this linear binding pattern was contended by other models, including a model in which one Pγ molecule binds to the Pαβ GAF domains, whereas the second Pγ molecule binds to the catalytic domain(s) (31Yamazaki M. Li N. Bondarenko V.A. Yamazaki R.K. Baehr W. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40675-40686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Another layer of complexity of the Pγ/Pαβ interaction is added by the heterogeneity of Pα and Pβ in the amino acid sequences that implies a structural difference between these two catalytic subunits (35Artemyev N.O. Natochin M. Busman M. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5407-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). With little evidence available to differentiate the interactions of Pγ/Pα and Pγ/Pβ, it is not clear whether each of the two Pγ subunits binds only one of the Pα and Pβ subunits or both of them simultaneously, although the conventional models suggest that each Pγ binds only one of Pα and Pβ (1Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 7Zhang X. Cote R.H. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 1191-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A glimpse of differential interactions of Pγ with Pα and Pβ was obtained from our recent work that indicated a preferential binding of the Phe30 region to Pα and the Ser40 region to Pβ, which led to a suggestion that each of the two identical Pγ subunits may bind Pα and Pβ simultaneously (37Guo L.-W. Grant J.E. Hajipour A.R. Muradov H. Arbabian M. Artemyev N.O. Ruoho A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12585-12592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To elucidate a Pγ/Pαβ interaction pattern, we have carried out photolabel transfer to Pαβ in a systematic manner from 10 positions evenly spread throughout the entire Pγ molecule. A successful Pαβ domain dissection by thorough proteolytic analysis allowed us to identify the Pγ-binding regions on Pα and Pβ with a given Pγ position, and the use of Pγ constructs with dual photoprobes enabled us to observe a dually cross-linked holo-PDE6 complex. The combined data indicate an interaction pattern that each Pγ binds Pα and Pβ linearly and, quite possibly, simultaneously. Materials—Clostripain (Clos) was purchased from Promega; thrombin (Throm) was from Novagen; V8 protease (V8) and endoproteinase Asp-N (AspN) were from Sigma; Genenase I (Gen) was from New England Biolabs.

Preparation of Holo-PDE6, Pαβ Heterodimer, and Nicked Pαβ (nPαβ)—Bovine rod outer segment membranes were prepared by the method of Papermaster and Dreyer (38Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Holo-PDE6 was then extracted from bleached rod outer segment membranes and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a YM-30 Amicon membrane (22Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The PDE6 catalytic heterodimer (Pαβ) was prepared by removing Pγ through mild tryptic proteolysis of holo-PDE6. More vigorous trypsinization produced nPαβ, the Pαβ heterodimer with nicking on Pβ between residues 146 and 148, as described previously (35Artemyev N.O. Natochin M. Busman M. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E.

Pαβ and nPαβ were purified to >95% purity by a Mono-Q column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), as judged from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. Limited Proteolysis of nPαβ and Identification of Proteolytic Fragments—nPαβ was incubated with each protease under the conditions listed in Table 1. To terminate proteolysis, 0.5 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, reconstituted in 5 ml of H2O) was added, the reaction was then boiled for 5 min in the dark in sample buffer including 50 mm DTT and 1% SDS. The proteolytic fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred in a tank system to an Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (0.45 micron, Millipore) at 75 volts for 1.5 h in transfer buffer containing 10 mm CAPS (pH 11) and 10% methanol. The blots were used either for Western blotting detection of the original N termini with anti-Pα antibody, or microsequencing to identify fragments containing a new N terminus generated by proteolysis. For microsequencing, the blots were stained in Amido Black for 30 s, destained in methanol, rinsed intensely with double distilled water, and then air-dried. The desired bands were excised for microsequencing at the Macromolecular Structure Facility of Michigan State University.TABLE 1Proteolysis conditions used for domain dissection of Pα and PβProteaseSpecific activitynPαβ or PαβAmount of proteaseSDSCleavage timeSupplement reagents%hClostripain100 units/mg5.4 μg nPαβ0.25 μg0.11.52 mm CaCl2/DTTThrombina1× thrombin cleavage buffer was used instead of Buffer UB.1.44 units/μl3.6 μg nPαβ0.5 μl0162 m urea2.25 μg Pαβ1.4 μl0.1161 mm DTTV80.5 units/μg2.7 μg nPαβ0.08 μg0.13Asp-N—bNot available.2.7 μg nPαβ0.05 μg0.06161 mm DTTGencAlternatively, a similar cleavage pattern can be obtained by using 0.075 μl of Genenase I and 0.06% SDS.—2.7 μg nPαβ0.1 μl0.25162 mm DTTa 1× thrombin cleavage buffer was used instead of Buffer UB.b Not available.c Alternatively, a similar cleavage pattern can be obtained by using 0.075 μl of Genenase I and 0.06% SDS.

The reaction mixtures of nPαβ (or Pαβ) and Pγ photoprobes with the desired concentrations were dark incubated on ice for 15 min, and then subjected to UV light. The reactions with FAzB-Pγ photoprobes sitting in ice water were exposed to the light generated by an AH-6 water-jacketed 1000-watt high pressure mercury lamp for 5 s at a distance of 10 cm. The UV light <300 nm was effectively filtered by a Pyrex glass water jacket of the lamp and the polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes. The reactions with a benzophenone photoprobe (BBM or mBP) were photolyzed at 5–10 °C two times for 15 min with a 5-min dark interval on ice, in a RPR-100 Rayonet Photochemical Reactor equipped with 18 light bulbs of 350 nm (Southern New England Ultraviolet Co.). The sample buffer containing SDS and DTT was added to the reactions immediately after photolysis or subsequent proteolysis, the proteins (or proteolytic fragments) were then separated by SDS-PAGE. Other Methods—Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) of the HPLC-purified Pγ photoprobes was performed in the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the Chemistry Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The samples were analyzed using a Shimadzu 2010 LCMS (Columbia, MD) equipped with a C18 column (Supelco Discovery BIO Wide Pore C18, 5 μm, 150 × 2.1 mm, 200 μl/min). The mobile phase A was 0.4% formic acid/water and mobile phase B was 0.2% formic acid/acetonitrile. A standard gradient from 5 to 95% B was used. Western blotting, far Western blotting, and protein quantitation were performed as previously described (37Guo L.-W. Grant J.E. Hajipour A.R. Muradov H. Arbabian M. Artemyev N.O. Ruoho A.E. J. Biol.

Dilution of primary antibodies was: anti-Pα, 4,000-fold; anti-Pβ, 1,000-fold; and anti-Pγ, 10,000-fold. The secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was diluted by 500,000-fold. The biotin-label transfer was detected by far Western blotting using streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) (100,000-fold dilution). 8% Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) polyacrylamide gels were prepared with a supplement of 20% glycerol. Native PAGE was performed at 5–10 °C with the buffers free of SDS. 16.5% gels were made by a modified Tricine gel protocol (42Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The precast 7% NuPAGE gels were run according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Domain Dissection of PDE6 α and β Subunits—Domain dissection of Pαβ has not been previously reported, although the GAF domains and the catalytic domains of the homodimer of PDE2 were successfully separated by limited proteolysis combined with cyanogen bromide cleavage (43Stroop S.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23802-23809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Part of the difficulty for dissecting Pαβ likely arises from the complexity of the heterodimer. In this study we have obtained separated domains of Pα and Pβ through systematic proteolysis (Fig. 1). It was determined that the key for successful conditions was use of SDS in the proteolysis reactions (Table 1). Low SDS (e.g. 0.1%) enhanced cleavage likely by improving access of the protease to substrate without denaturing the protease. To gain differentiated information from Pα and Pβ, nPαβ was used for these experiments. Although Pα and Pβ in the Pαβ sample are too similar in size to be separated by SDS-PAGE, Pβ of nPαβ is shortened by 16.4 kDa on a SDS gel due to the nicking (tPβ), and thereby produced proteolytic fragments of different lengths than Pα (Fig. 1A). Taking advantage of this, we obtained different proteolytic cleavage patterns of Pβ than Pα and thus were able to differentiate the regions on Pα and Pβ that were photolabeled from a given position of Pγ. As shown in Fig. 1, five proteases were selected for domain dissection of Pα and Pβ because they produced relatively simple and robust cleavage patterns that rendered identification of the proteolytic fragments practical. The proteolytic fragments of Pα containing the original N terminus were recognized by Western blot using an antibody against the first 16 amino acids of Pα. The fragments with a proteolysis-generated new N terminus were unambiguously identified through microsequencing. The C terminus of each proteolytic fragment was determined from the most likely cleavage site based on the size of the proteolytic band (Fig. 1B) and the favored and unfavorable cleavage sequences for the protease (44Keil B. Specificity of Proteolysis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 335Google Scholar) (supplemental Table SI). The maps of dissected Pα and tPβ have thus been obtained. As indicated in Fig. 1A, The GAF region (GAFa plus GAFb) and the catalytic domain of Pα were readily separated by cleavage with either Genenase I or V8 protease, because these two enzymes both cleave"

Paradoxically, protein synthesis is required for apoptosis to occur in many experimental settings. Previous studies showed that two proteins that regulate apoptosis by controlling caspase activity, XIAP and Apaf-1, are translated by a unique, cap-independent mechanism mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that is used preferentially under conditions in which normal cap-dependent translation is repressed. We investigated the regulation of XIAP and Apaf-1 following UVC irradiation. We show that UVC irradiation leads to the inhibition of translation and cell death. Furthermore, IRES-mediated translation of Apaf-1, but not XIAP, is enhanced by UVC irradiation, and this increase in Apaf-1 translation correlated with cell death. The enhanced Apaf-1 IRES-mediated translation is caspase-independent but is negatively modulated by the eIF2α kinase protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase. These data suggest that progression of UV-induced apoptosis requires IRES-mediated translation of Apaf-1 to ensure continuous levels of Apaf-1 despite an overall suppression of protein synthesis.

These data suggest that progression of UV-induced apoptosis requires IRES-mediated translation of Apaf-1 to ensure continuous levels of Apaf-1 despite an overall suppression of protein synthesis. Normal cellular functions require complex control of cellular homeostasis, and apoptosis plays an essential role in this process. In this context, apoptosis is a cellular stress response that serves to eliminate cells that are too damaged to maintain their proper function. UV light is a common type of environmental stress that causes DNA damage and induces apoptosis in mammalian cells by engaging the mitochondrial branch of apoptotic signaling pathway (1Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). This pathway of apoptosis requires the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm, where it binds to the adaptor protein Apaf-1, triggering the formation of the apoptosome (2Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Formation of the apoptosome results in the stepwise activation of caspases-9 and -3 that, in turn, cleave intracellular substrates leading to the final demise of the cell (3Adams J.M. Cory S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The assembly of the apoptosome and autoactivation of caspase-9 represent critical events in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and Apaf-1 plays a central role in this process.

Thus, both Apaf-1 and XIAP play critical but opposing roles in the regulation of the activity of the apoptosome.Previous studies have underlined the importance of Apaf-1 and XIAP in regulating UV-induced apoptosis. It was shown that increased Apaf-1 protein levels correlate with increased sensitivity to UV-induced apoptosis (5Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Yoshida R. Elia A.J. Hakem A. Hakem R. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W.

Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar), as well as Apaf-1-deficient K562 and CEM leukemic cells (6Jia L. Srinivasula S.M. Liu F.T. Newland A.C. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Kelsey S.M. Blood. 2001; 98: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), all exhibited increased resistance to UV-induced apoptosis. In contrast, restoration of Apaf-1 protein levels by transient transfection restored the sensitivity of leukemic cells to UV-induced apoptosis (6Jia L. Srinivasula S.M. Liu F.T. Newland A.C. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Kelsey S.M. Blood. 2001; 98: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). On the other hand, increased XIAP protein levels conferred resistance of MCF-7 cells to UV-induced apoptosis (8Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar).Given the importance of Apaf-1 and XIAP proteins in the control of the cellular response to UV irradiation, it is important to understand the mechanisms involved in regulating the expression of both of these proteins. Cells generally respond to environmental stress stimuli by inhibiting global translation. In contrast, a small proportion of mRNAs containing IRES (internal ribosome entry sequence) elements within their 5′-untranslated region (UTR) are refractory to this inhibition and continue to be efficiently translated (9Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Korneluk R.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 469-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). UV irradiation was shown to inhibit protein synthesis by inducing phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α by either the PERK (10Wu S. Hu Y. Wang J.-L. Chatterjee M. Shi Y.

Interestingly, both Apaf-1 and XIAP contain IRES elements within their respective 5′-UTRs and exhibit distinct modes of regulation (13Nevins T.A. Harder Z.M. Korneluk R.G. Holcik M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3572-3579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Henis-Korenblit S. Shani G. Sines T. Marash L. Shohat G. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5400-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of Apaf-1 or XIAP translation during UV irradiation-induced apoptosis has not been explored.In the present study we investigated the regulation of Apaf-1 and XIAP expression during UV stress. We found that UV irradiation inhibits protein synthesis and triggers dose-dependent cell death in 293T cells. However, Apaf-1 protein levels are significantly enhanced following UV irradiation. This paradox is explained by the translational induction of Apaf-1 expression mediated by the Apaf-1 IRES element in response to UV irradiation, which is refractory to UV-mediated inhibition of global protein synthesis. In contrast, translation of XIAP was inhibited to the same extend as global protein synthesis. We further found that the translation of Apaf-1 is independent of the phosphorylation status of eIF2α but is modulated by the eIF2α kinase PERK both in vitro and in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection Reagents—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts from PERK-null (PERK–/–) or PERK wild-type (PERK+/+) mice were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Wisent Inc.) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin), 1% essential amino acids, and 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol. Human embryonic kidney (293T) cells were maintained in standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin). Transient transfection and co-transfection were done using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml in 6-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine (5 μg/ml) and were transfected 24 h later in serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) with 2 μg of DNA and 4 μl of lipid per well. The transfection mixture was replaced 4 h later with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1% antibiotics. Co-transfections of 293T cells were done as described above except that 1 μg of bicistronic plasmid was combined with 1 μgof expression vector.Plasmids—The bicistronic vectors pβgal/hUTR/CAT (containing the human XIAP IRES) and pβgal/Apaf-1/CAT (containing the Apaf-1 IRES) were described previously (15Holcik M.

The intensity of UVC light was measured prior to each experiment with a UVX radiometer (UVP Inc., Upland, CA). Transfected cells were irradiated 24 h post-transfection as described above. For the z-VAD-fmk experiments the cells were pre-treated with z-VAD-fmk (100 μm) or Me2SO for 2 h before UVC treatment and for 24 h post UVC treatment. Cell viability was determined 24 h following UVC irradiation using the Vi-Cell cell viability analyzer (Beckman Coulter).Analysis of Global Protein Synthesis—Both control and UV-irradiated cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (200 μCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h in methionine/cysteine-free minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) in which l-cysteine was added to a final concentration of 63 mg/liter. Cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (15 Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin (all from Sigma). The lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were collected. Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by using a protein assay kit (Bradford Assay, Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The total proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250) staining, and the 35S incorporation was visualized by autoradiography.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described above. Equal amounts of protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. The antibodies used were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Stratagene), mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc (Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-T7 (Novagen), rabbit monoclonal anti-eIF2α (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho eIF2α (Ser-51, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal anti-XIAP (Ægera), mouse monoclonal anti-Actin (Sigma), rat monoclonal anti-Apaf-1 (Chemicon), rabbit polyclonal anti-CREB2/ATF4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse monoclonal anti-processed caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology). The antibodies were used at the manufacturer's suggested dilutions, and conditions were followed by secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, Amersham Biosciences). Antibody complexes were detected using the ECL plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). If quantification of protein data was required the Western blots were performed as described above, but the secondary antibody used was Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-mouse, anti-rat, or anti-rabbit IgG (LI-Cor Inc.). Antibody complexes were then detected and quantified using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging system (LI-Cor Inc.).β-Galactosidase and CAT Analysis—Cells were briefly washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in the CAT ELISA kit lysis buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. β-Galactosidase enzymatic activity in cell extracts was spectrophotometrically determined using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galacotpyranoside (18MacGregor G.R. Nolan G.P. Fiering S. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Murray E.J. Walker J.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1991: 217-235Google Scholar). The CAT levels were determined using the CAT ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The relative IRES activity was determined as a ratio of CAT/β-galactosidase in three independent experiments performed in triplicates. All data are shown as an average ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in triplicates.RNA Interference—293T cells were transfected in a 6-well plate with control siRNA (CY3-labeled, U47296, Dharmacon) or with a PERK-targeting Smartpool (M-004883-01, Dharmacon) using RNAiFect (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were replated on the next day, and the levels of PERK message were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR 72 h post-transfection. For detection of Apaf-1 IRES activity, the PERK or control siRNA transfected cells were transfected the day following siRNA transfection with the Apaf-1 bicistronic plasmid pβgal/Apaf-1/CAT. The UVC irradiation and β-galactosidase and CAT analyses were performed as described above.Ribonuclease Protection Assay—Total RNA was isolated from UVC-treated or control cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with 1 unit of DNase I. The 32P-labeled antisense RNA probes spanning 162 nucleotides of the XIAP 5′-UTR (coordinates 0 to –162), the complete Apaf-1 5′-UTR, or human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (BD Pharmingen) were synthesized using the MaxiScript T7 transcription kit (Ambion) and gel-purified. RPA analyses were performed using the RPA III kit (Ambion) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was hybridized overnight at 42 °C with 5 × 104 cpm of high specific activity probe and then digested with an RNase A/RNase T1 mix. The digested samples were ethanol-precipitated and separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The protected fragments were visualized by x-ray film and quantified on a Bio-Rad Model GS-670 imaging densitometer.Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from UVC-treated or control cells that were previously transfected with the pβgal/Apaf-1/CAT reporter plasmid as described above. For quantitative RT-PCR, reverse transcription was carried out using the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) with NotI-d(T)18 primers. The quantitative PCR was performed using the QuantiTect SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen) and analyzed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system using the ABI Prism 7000 SDS Software. Quantitative PCRs were carried out to detectβ-galactosidase (5′-ACTATCCCGACCGCCTTACT-3′ and 5′-CTGTAGCGGCTGATGTTGAA-3′) and CAT (5′-GCGTGTTACGGTGAAAACCT-3′ and 5′-GGGCGAAGAAGTTGTCCATA-3′) as described previously (19Holcik M. Graber T. Lewis S.M. Lefebvre C.A. Lacasse E. Baird S. RNA. 2005; 11: 1605-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The primers for detection of PERK were as follows: forward, 5′-CTCACAGGCAAAGGAAGGAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-AACAACTCCAAAGCCACCAC-3′.RESULTSUV Irradiation Induces Cell Death and Inhibits Protein Synthesis—To investigate the regulatory mechanism of UVC-induced cell death, we first determined the sensitivity of 293T cells to UVC irradiation. Twenty-four hours after exposure to increasing doses of UVC the percentage of surviving 293T cells was determined by viable cell count using the Beckman Coulter Vi-Cell 1.01 cell viability analyzer. UVC irradiation was found to induce cell death in a dose-dependent manner, with 50% cell survival at a UVC dose of 300 J/m2 and only 10% survival at 450 J/m2 (Fig. 1A). The 300 J/m2 dose was therefore chosen for subsequent experiments.We next asked whether the exposure of 293T cells to UVC irradiation also inhibits protein synthesis in 293T cells as have been shown previously for other cell lines (10Wu S.

Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). UVC-irradiated 293T cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met, and protein lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography. These analyses revealed that protein synthesis was substantially reduced in the UVC-irradiated cells compared with non-irradiated 293T cells (Fig. 1B), confirming that UV irradiation inhibits protein synthesis in 293T cells.Apaf-1 but Not XIAP Protein Expression Is Induced by UVC Irradiation and Is Necessary for UV-induced Cell Death—We next investigated whether UV irradiation affects the expression of Apaf-1 and XIAP, two proteins involved in the regulation of UV-mediated cell death. When compared with the corresponding expression of endogenous Apaf-1 and XIAP in non-irradiated 293T cells, the expression of Apaf-1 increased significantly in UVC-irradiated cells, whereas the expression of XIAP was slightly reduced (Fig. 2A). When we examined the RNA samples isolated from treated and untreated cells by RPA analysis we noted that the levels of Apaf-1 mRNA did not change in response to UVC irradiation (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the observed increase in Apaf-1 protein levels following UVC irradiation could be due to translational up-regulation of Apaf-1.FIGURE 2UVC induces the expression of Apaf-1 but not XIAP via IRES-mediated translation. A, 293T cells were treated with the indicated doses of UVC irradiation, total protein lysates were prepared 24 h later and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Endogenous expression of Apaf-1 and XIAP proteins was determined by Western blot analyses using antibodies against Apaf-1 and XIAP, respectively. The expression of β-actin in both UVC-treated and untreated cells was used as a control. B, ribonuclease protein assay (RPA) of Apaf-1, XIAP, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs in treated and untreated cells (same as A). C, 293T cells were transiently transfected with the XIAP or Apaf-1 IRES bicistronic reporter constructs and the effect of UVC irradiation on XIAP (white bars) and Apaf-1 IRES (black bars) translation were determined 24 h later by measuring the β-galactosidase and CAT activities as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The relative IRES activity in non-irradiated cells was set as 1 for each construct. The bars represent the average ± S.D. determined from three independent experiments performed in triplicates. D, quantitative RT-PCR was performed on DNase I-treated total RNA isolated from 293T cells transfected with Apaf-1 IRES bicistronic plasmids. The RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using the QuantiTect SYBR green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and analyzed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system using the ABI Prism 7000 SDS Software. Quantitative PCR reactions were carried out to detect the β-galactosidase and CAT cistrons of the bicistronic mRNA. The CAT/β-galactosidase ratio was calculated as 2–[Ct(CAT)–Ct(βgal)].

Because both the Apaf-1 and XIAP mRNAs have IRES elements within their 5′-UTRs, we examined the effect of UVC irradiation on the activity of Apaf1 and XIAP IRES elements. To study IRES-mediated translation exclusively, we used the previously described bicistronic pβgal/CAT reporter plasmid that has the β-galactosidase gene and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene as first and second cistrons, respectively, with the IRES to be tested inserted between the two cistrons (15Holcik M. Lefebvre C.A. Yeh C. Chow T. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In this system, expression of the second cistron (CAT) is dependent on IRES activity. Bicistronic reporter plasmids carrying either the Apaf1 IRES or the XIAP IRES were transfected into 293T cells, and IRES-dependent translation of CAT was determined 24 h after treatment with increasing doses of UVC irradiation (Fig. 2C). The activity of the XIAP IRES (as measured by CAT expression) was inhibited to the same extend as global protein synthesis (measured by β-galactosidase expression). In sharp contrast, the activity of the Apaf-1 IRES paralleled the increase in UVC dose, with a 5-fold increase in activity at an UVC dose of 200 J/m2, and an 8-fold increase in activity at 450 J/m2 (Fig. 2C and Table 1).TABLE 1UVC irradiation enhances Apaf-1 IRES-mediated translation but not cap-dependent or XIAP IRES-dependent translationConstructaCells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and exposed to 0 or 450 J/m2 UVC 24 h post-transfection as described under “Experimental Procedures.”β-Galactosidasebβ-Galactosidase (cap-dependent) and CAT (IRES-dependent) levels were determined 24 h post-UV irradiation as described under “Experimental Procedures” and are shown per 1 μg of total protein.CATbβ-Galactosidase (cap-dependent) and CAT (IRES-dependent) levels were determined 24 h post-UV irradiation as described under “Experimental Procedures” and are shown per 1 μg of total protein.Relative IRES activitycRelative IRES activity was determined as CAT/β-galactosidase.Apaf-1 (0 J/m2)0.184 (±0.031)0.213 (±0.049)1.157Apaf-1 (450 J/m2)0.105 (±0.023)1.021 (±0.093)9.724XIAP (0 J/m2)0.210 (±0.038)2.173 (±0.098)10.347XIAP (450 J/m2)0.098 (±0.029)0.638 (±0.078)6.518a Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and exposed to 0 or 450 J/m2 UVC 24 h post-transfection as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b β-Galactosidase (cap-dependent) and CAT (IRES-dependent) levels were determined 24 h post-UV irradiation as described under “Experimental Procedures” and are shown per 1 μg of total protein.c Relative IRES activity was determined as CAT/β-galactosidase. Open table in a new tab It is formally possible that the observed induction of Apaf-1 IRES activity is due to transcriptional induction, cryptic promoter activity, or spurious splicing of the bicistronic RNA transcript (βgal/Apaf-1/CAT) produced from the pβgal/Apaf-1/CAT plasmid, thus altering the ratio of CAT protein to β-galactosidase protein. We therefore determined the effect of UVC irradiation on the integrity of the βgal/Apaf-1/CAT bicistronic RNA transcript using quantitative RT-PCR as described previously (19Holcik M. Graber T. Lewis S.M. Lefebvre C.A. Lacasse E. Baird S. RNA. 2005; 11: 1605-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated 24 h post-UVC irradiation and subjected to quantitative RT-PCR of the Apaf-1 bicistronic mRNA, and this confirmed that the increase in Apaf-1 IRES activity was not due to transcriptional induction, cryptic promoter activity, or spurious splicing of the bicistronic mRNA (Fig. 2D).The results presented above demonstrate that increasing doses of UVC irradiation induce Apaf-1 IRES-dependent translation that correlates with a loss of viability in 293T cells. These data are in agreement with previously published findings that repression of Apaf-1 expression using small interfering RNA (siRNA) to Apaf-1 (21Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y.

The vesicular transmitter content has recently been shown to be directly dependent on the expression levels of vesicular neurotransmitter transporters indicating that the transport capacity of synaptic vesicles is a critical determinant for synaptic efficacy. Using synaptic vesicles prepared from whole brain at different times of the day we now show that the amount of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) 1 undergoes strong diurnal cycling. VGLUT1 protein levels are high before the start of the light period, decline at noon, increase again before start of the dark period, and decline again at midnight. Mice kept in complete darkness showed within a 24-h period only a single peak of VGLUT1 expression in the middle of the rest phase. In contrast, mice lacking the period gene Period 2, a core component of the circadian clock, did not show any light-cycle-dependent changes of VGLUT1 levels. No other of several synaptic vesicle proteins examined underwent circadian cycling. Circadian cycling of VGLUT1 was not seen when analyzing homogenate or synaptosomes, the starting fraction for vesicle preparation. Circadian cycling of VGLUT1 was also not reflected at the mRNA level. We conclude that nerve terminals are endowed with mechanisms that regulate quantal size by changing the copy number of transporters in synaptic vesicles. A reduced amount of VGLUT1 per vesicle is probably achieved by means of selective sorting controlled by clock genes.

All major biological functions of mammals follow a pattern of daily rhythms depending on the rotation of the earth and the repeated rising and setting of the sun. In the absence of environmental cues, i.e. the natural light-dark cycle, endogenous rhythms, termed circadian rhythms, display a periodicity close to 24 h, reflecting the intrinsic biological clock. Circadian rhythms in different tissues including brain are orchestrated by a master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This clock synchronizes physiological and biochemical pathways thereby allowing the organism to anticipate daily requests and adapt to environmental changes. In the last years, genetic analyses revealed two transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 that induce transcription of Period (Per1, Per2, and Per3) and Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) genes. The Per and Cry gene products in turn are thought to inhibit the activity of CLOCK and BMAL1 and thereby constitute a negative feedback loop (1Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar, 2Albrecht U. Eichele G. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 2003; 13: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This molecular principle appears to exist in almost every cell.Among the three Per genes Per2 seems to play a critical role in adaptation of the clock to the environmental light-dark cycle. Notably Per2Brdm1 mutant mice that carry a deletion in the PAS domain of the Per2 protein display impaired clock resetting in response to light (3Albrecht U. Zheng B. Larkin D. Sun Z.S. Lee C.C. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2001; 16: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and an increase in alcohol consumption (4Spanagel R. Pendyala G. Abarca C. Zghoul T. Sanchis-Segura C. Magnone M.C.

These findings are most likely related to a hyperglutamatergic state in these mice due to a reduction in the expression of the glutamate transporter EAAT1 (4Spanagel R. Pendyala G. Abarca C.

Although astrocytic plasma membrane glutamate transporters like EAAT1 are responsible for clearing the synaptic cleft from presynaptically released glutamate, vesicular transporters concentrate glutamate in synaptic vesicles of the presynapse, thus filling them for the next round of exocytosis. Two isoforms of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT 3The abbreviations used are: VGLUT, vesicular glutamate transporter; SV, synaptic vesicle; ZT, Zeitgeber time; CT, circadian time; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; LD, light/dark; DD, dark/dark.3The abbreviations used are: VGLUT, vesicular glutamate transporter; SV, synaptic vesicle; ZT, Zeitgeber time; CT, circadian time; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; LD, light/dark; DD, dark/dark.)1 and -2) have been identified in glutamatergic neurons and a third occurs as a cotransmitter transporter in other types of neurons (Ref. 5Ahnert-Hilger G.

Studies of VGLUT1–/– mice revealed that the amount of transporter per vesicle is crucial for the amount of glutamate loaded and that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 target to functionally distinct synaptic release sites (6Fremeau.

The data suggest a novel sorting mechanism by which the presynaptic terminal may regulate its transmitter output.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Per2Brdm1 mice used in this study were characterized previously (8Zheng B. Larkin D.W. Albrecht U. Sun Z.S. Sage M. Eichele G. Lee C.C. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 400: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The wild type and Per2Brdm1 animals used represent littermates derived from intercrosses between heterozygous Per2Brdm1 mice on a 129SvEvBrd/C57/BL/6-Tyrc-Brd background. Mice were kept under either an uninterrupted 12 h light/12 h dark or dark/dark cycle for at least 7 or 3 days, respectively, before the start of the experiment (9Albrecht U. Foster R.G. Methods. 2002; 20: 465-477Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Antibodies—The following antibodies were generous gifts from R. Jahn, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany: mouse monoclonal antibodies against synaptobrevin II (clone 69.1, Ref. 10Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), synaptophysin (clone 7.2, Ref. 11Jahn R. Schiebler W. Oimet C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Monoclonal antibodies against synaptotagmin, Rab3A, and synapsin were purchased from Synaptic Systems, Göttingen. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against VGLUT1 and the 116-kDa subunit of the vacuolar proton pump were from Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany and against actin from Sigma, respectively. Secondary antibodies for Western blot detection, horse anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA.Synaptosomes and Synaptic Vesicles—Isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes) were prepared at 4 °C from adult mouse whole brains in the presence of protease inhibitors. SV (LP2 fraction) were prepared from mouse brains following the procedure described (10Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 14Becher A. Drenckhahn A. Hähnlein I. Magittai M. Jahn R. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1922-1931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were sacrificed at the given time points either in the light/dark cycle (Zeitgeber time, ZT) or the dark/dark cycle (circadian time, CT).Generally, wild type and Per2Brdm1 mutants were analyzed in parallel. Protein determination was performed from the individual membrane fractions and equal amounts of protein were loaded for SDS-PAGE.For each set of experiments membrane fractions were run in parallel, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and further processed for immunodetection using the ECL detection system. In some experiments especially when homogenates were analyzed, Triton X-114 phase partitioning was performed to extract membrane proteins. Briefly, 0.5 mg of protein was extracted with partitioning buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-114 for 15 min on ice followed by an incubation for 5 min at 37 °C until the sample turned cloudy. The sample was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 2 min resulting in a lower detergent phase and an upper aqueous phase. The upper aqueous phase was extracted once again with 1% Triton X-114. The detergent phases from both the extractions were pooled, and protein was precipitated by the conventional methanol/chloroform (1:1) precipitation method. The final protein pellet was air-dried thoroughly before dissolving in Laemmli buffer (15Pryde J.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 88: 23-33PubMed Google Scholar).ECL-processed films were scanned by video imaging, and protein bands were densitometrically quantified using the SCAN PACK 3.0 program. It was ensured that the signals are in the linear range of the ECL detection system. Quantification was performed as described (16Hinz B. Becher A. Mitter D. Schulze K. Heinemann U. Draguhn A. Ahnert-Hilger G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) along with statistical analysis using the paired Student's t test.Glutamate Uptake—Glutamate uptake was performed with vesicles prepared and frozen at the indicated time points. A comparison between frozen and freshly prepared vesicles ensured that there was no difference in the overall glutamate uptake. Thawed vesicles were suspended in KGC buffer (150 mm K+-gluconate, 20 mm PIPES, 4 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, KOH), and 25 μl of this suspension (corresponding to 30–60 μg of protein) were added to individual tubes containing 25 μl of KGC supplemented with 4 mm ATP (2 mm final ATP concentration in KGC/ATP buffer) and with 158.4 μm glutamate and 1.6 μm [3H]glutamate (l-[G-3H]glutamic acid, specific activity 1220 Bq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). Uptake was performed for 10 min at 36 °C and stopped by adding 500 μl of ice-cold KGC/ATP buffer. Samples were spun down (10 min, 460,000 × g) and washed once using KGC/ATP buffer. The pellets were lysed with 0.4% Triton X-100 to determine radioactivity by scintillation counting and protein content by the BCA method. Nonspecific binding was performed in the presence of 5 μm nigericin and 20 μm valinomycin and reached values between 0.05 and 0.12 nmol/mg of protein. Values were expressed as nmol/mg of protein and corrected for nonspecific binding (17Winter S. Brunk I. Walther D.J. Höltje M. Jiang M. Peter J-U. Takamori S. Jahn R. Birnbaumer L. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4672-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).In Situ Hybridization—Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under ambient light conditions at ZT6 and ZT12 and under a 15 W safety red light at ZT18 and ZT24. Brains were quickly dissected out and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 12–18 h. Tissues were then dehydrated with ethanol (30, 50, 70, and 100%, 3 h each at 4 °C) and transferred to xylene at room temperature. Xylene was changed once before being replaced by 50% xylene/50% paraffin. Then tissue was placed in paraffin, which was exchanged three times at 60 °C before pouring it in embedding boats. Brain sections (7 μm), were cut using a microtome (R. Jung, Hamburg, Germany) and stored at room temperature until further use.The probes for VGLUT1 were made from cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 801–1380 (GenBank™ accession number NM_053859) and for VGLUT2 from nucleotides 1579–2238 (GenBank™ accession number NM_053427). 35S rUTP-labeled riboprobe synthesis and hybridization steps were performed as described (18Albrecht U.

CRC Press, New York1998: 93-119Google Scholar).RESULTSOscillation of the Amount of VGLUT1 in SV under Light/Dark and Dark/Dark Conditions—A variety of vesicular integral membrane and associated proteins including the vesicular transmitter transporters VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 were analyzed in SV fractions obtained from whole brain of wild type and Per2Brdm1 mice entrained in a 12 h light/12 h dark (LD 12:12) cycle at the indicated time points (Fig. 1). The time points ZT refer to ZT24/0 at 6:00 a.m. before the light was switched on, ZT6 at noon, ZT12 at 6:00 p.m., dawn, before the light was switched off, and ZT18 at 12:00 a.m. in the middle of the night. The amount of VGLUT1 in the SV fractions varied over the LD cycle being high at ZT24/0 and ZT12 before the light was switched on or off, respectively, and low in either the middle of the day or the night (Fig. 1A). Relative amounts of vesicular proteins based on ratios to the amount of synaptophysin as an abundant integral vesicular membrane protein and actin as a further internal control were taken. Quantification over 4–6 independent experiments revealed a significant change in the amount of VGLUT1 in the SV fraction dependent on the time of day. VGLUT1 to synaptophysin ratios were high just before the beginning of the light phase (ZT24/0) and the dark phase (ZT12), respectively, and were reduced to about half of these amounts in the middle of the day (ZT12) and the night (ZT18). VGLUT2 also varied slightly, but these variations were less pronounced (Fig. 1A). The protein pattern of VGLUT1 was altered in SV obtained from Per2Brdm1 mice with a more even expression over the day and a variable drop at midnight (Fig. 1B). The amount of other vesicular proteins like synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, and synaptobrevin or the vesicle-associated proteins Rab3 and synapsin and their ratios to synaptophysin varied neither in wild type nor in Per2Brdm1 mice (Fig. 1). When mice were entrained to complete darkness (DD) the pattern obtained for the amount of VGLUT1 to synaptophysin ratio in the SV fractions changed remarkably. The maximum shifted to CT6 (Fig. 2A) in wild type mice with a double amount of the VGLUT1 to synaptophysin ratio compared with CT18. The observed variation was confirmed with a different polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2A, antibodies m and p). This pattern of the VGLUT1 to synaptophysin ratio was not altered in the Per2Brdm1 mutants and resembles the pattern observed under LD conditions in Per2Brdm1 mutants (compare Fig. 2B with 1B), whereas the amounts of other vesicular proteins were identical irrespective of the time of day (Fig. 2). Because Per2Brdm1 mutants get arrhythmic in complete darkness after 4 days or more, animals were sacrificed at the third day of the changed entrainment. At this time point rhythmicity still persists in the mutants, allowing for a documentation of their respective circadian time (3Albrecht U. Zheng B. Larkin D. Sun Z.S. Lee C.C. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2001; 16: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Oscillation of VGLUT1 amount in SV under dark/dark condition. SVs were prepared at the indicated time points either from wild type (A) or Per2Brdm1 (B) mice. The dark/dark condition is also reflected by the black bar heading the blot documentation and below each individual graph. The vesicular membrane fractions were analyzed for the proteins indicated. Quantification was performed by calculating the ratio of synaptophysin to VGLUT1, VGLUT2, or the other SV proteins indicated. The amount of synaptophysin was calibrated against the amount of actin. Values are obtained in three to five different sets of experiments. Stars denote significance (p < 0.05) according to Student's t test between time points CT6 and CT18.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)VGLUT1 Protein and mRNA Levels in Various Brain Fractions and in Brain Sections—The data indicate that the amount of VGLUT1 varies in the SV fraction dependent on the time of day. These variations may reflect circadian-dependent protein synthesis or degradation. Alternatively a selective sorting out of VGLUT1 from the SV to another membrane pool by membrane traffic could be considered. To discriminate between these two possibilities we analyzed the initial homogenate and the synaptosomes, which represent the starting material for the preparation of SV. As can be seen in Fig. 3A there were no considerable variations in the ratios of VGLUT1 to synaptophysin in homogenates or synaptosomes either in the LD (Fig. 3A) or in the DD conditions (Fig. 3B). The quantification of the ratios between the amounts of VGLUT1 and synaptophysin in synaptosomes analyzed at the given ZT time points showed no oscillation at all (Fig. 3A, upper graph) and contrasts to the situation seen in the SV fractions (see Fig. 1A). The average VGLUT1 to synaptophysin ratios over all time points, for homogenate and synaptosomes in wild type and Per2Brdm1 mutants, respectively, again showed no apparent difference between the two genotypes (Fig. 3A). We also analyzed the VGLUT1 to synaptophysin ratios over all CT time points (DD condition) in homogenate and synaptosomes for wild type and Per2Brdm1 mutants. Comparable to the LD condition no changes between the different CT time points were observed in the DD condition in both genotypes (Fig. 3B). As a second approach we performed an in situ hybridization for VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in whole brain sections obtained from brains removed at the given time points (ZT). No oscillations in the expression of VGLUT1 or VGLUT2 were observed over the 24 h of a LD cycle (Fig. 3C). In addition there was no difference in the expression of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in Per2Brdm1 mutants compared with wild type littermates (Fig. 3C). A direct comparison between synaptosomes obtained from three different sets of wild type and Per2Brdm1 mutants at time point ZT24/0 or CT6, the time points with the highest VGLUT1 content in SV, revealed no difference in the overall amount of proteins under the LD condition. However, the overall ratio calculated from all time points of Rab3 and to a lesser extent of VGLUT1 to synaptophysin in synaptosomes was slightly decreased in Per2Brdm1 mutants under DD conditions (data not shown).FIGURE 3VGLUT1 at the protein and mRNA level in various brain fractions and in whole brain sections. Homogenate and synaptosomes representing the starting material for SV were analyzed in parallel from wild type or Per2Brdm1 mice entrained either under LD (A, white/black bar) or DD (B, black bar) conditions. Blots were stained with the antibodies indicated. The ratio of VGLUT1 to synaptophysin in synaptosomes (P2) (taken from three different sets) was quantified at the different ZT time points as in Fig. 1 (upper graph in A). In addition the average ratio of VGLUT1 to synaptophysin calculated from all ZT (lower graph in A) and CT (graph in B) time points in homogenate and P2 is shown. Note that the amounts of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in homogenates or synaptosomes are not changed between the different time points under either condition. Proteins from homogenate were extracted by Triton X-114 partitioning. In situ hybridization using VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 probes in whole brain sections (C, white/black bar) confirmed that the overall synthesis is not changed during circadian rhythm and between wild type and Per2Brdm1 mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Glutamate Uptake Reflects the Oscillation of VGLUT1—The amounts of VGLUT1 vary in wild type animals according to either light schedule or circadian time, which suggests variations in transmitter release at different time points of the day. Vesicular filling is a reliable process and directly depends on the amount of transporter per vesicle as has been shown by overexpressing VGLUT1 (7Wojcik S.M. Rhee S.E. Herzog E. Sigler A. Jahn R.

Generally variations in the amplitude of postsynaptic responses are taken as an indication of changes in the vesicular filling and thus on the amount of transporter per vesicle. However, other factors like the activity of plasma membrane transporters, affinity of the receptors, and the overall morphology of the synapse may contribute to and obscure changes in VGLUT amounts at the level of the vesicle (5Ahnert-Hilger G. Höltje M. Pahner I. Winter S. Brunk I. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 150: 140-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition removal of parts of the brain as necessary for electrophysiological analysis in slice preparations will probably lead to an interruption and a loss of the higher integration sustained by the suprachiasmatic nucleus. As a consequence the strict uniform entrainment for all systems will collapse, and the removed tissue may rely on its own rhythmicity no longer depending on circadian mechanisms. To overcome these restrictions we used another more direct approach by analyzing the amount of glutamate taken up in vesicular fractions prepared at the given ZT or CT. Corresponding to the amount of VGLUT1 in SV the glutamate uptake was significantly reduced at ZT6 compared with ZT24/0 and ZT12 (Fig. 4A). The parallel immunoreplica analyses of the homogenate and the SV for VGLUT1 and synaptophysin confirmed the circadian changes of VGLUT1 exclusively found in the SV fraction but not in the homogenate in wild type mice (Fig. 4A). In a second experiment SV from wild type and Per2Brdm1 mutants prepared at ZT12 and ZT18 were compared for glutamate uptake. Corresponding to the amounts of VGLUT1 at these time points glutamate uptake was reduced at ZT18 compared with ZT12 in both wild type and mutants (Fig. 4B). Because the activities of both VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 contribute to the glutamate uptake, the ratios of both VGLUT isoforms to synaptophysin were combined from the data in Fig. 1, which reflected the changes in the glutamate uptake at the various time points (Fig. 4C). Accordingly, in SV obtained from mice entrained in a DD cycle glutamate uptake was reduced by almost 60% at CT18 compared with CT6 reflecting the reduced protein levels of both VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 given as combined VGLUT to synaptophysin ratios (Fig. 4D). Together these data indicate that the circadian-specific oscillations in the amount of VGLUT1 and to a lesser extent of VGLUT2 are also reflected by the storage capacity of SV.FIGURE 4Glutamate uptake reflects the oscillation of VGLUT1. A–C, SV were prepared at the given time points of a LD cycle and analyzed for glutamate uptake or the amount of VGLUT1 and synaptophysin (Syp). The uptake is reduced at ZT6 parallel to a drop in the amount of VGLUT1 with no change in the amount of synaptophysin. In the homogenate extracted by Triton X-114 partitioning and analyzed for comparison the amounts of VGLUT1 and synaptophysin are similar at all ZT time points. Glutamate uptake was performed into SV prepared at the time points ZT12 and ZT18 of a LD cycle from wild type and Per2Brdm1 mice. The decrease in the uptake (∼25% in ZT6 and ZT 18 compared with the other time points) reflects the decrease in the amount of VGLUT in total to synaptophysin (37%) in the respective fractions from wild type and Per2Brdm1 mice. D, SV were prepared at the given time points (CT) of a DD cycle from wild type and Per2Brdm1 mice. The decrease in the uptake (∼60% in wild type and 30% in Per2Brdm1 mice) reflects the decrease in the amount of VGLUT in total to synaptophysin (60% in wild type and 50% in Per2Brdm1 mice) in this fraction in both wild type and mutant mice. Quantification of the VGLUT to synaptophysin ratios at the indicated time points include values combined from individual VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 to synaptophysin ratios from Figs. 1 and 2. Stars denote significance according to Student's t test with p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Generally, transmitter uptake strongly depends on the presence of the vacuolar proton pump, which is involved in the acidification of various intracellular organelles including SV. There was no difference in the ratio between the vacuolar proton pump identified by an antibody against its 116-kDa subunit and synaptophysin among time points ZT24/0, ZT 6, and ZT12, ZT18 in SV of wild type, and Per2Brdm1 mice under LD conditions. The ratios between VGLUT1 and synaptophysin analyzed for comparison revealed the expected differences between the two time points (see also Fig. 1). In addition the ratios between VGLUT1 or proton pump and synaptophysin did not vary in the homogenate fractions. As expected synaptophysin and VGLUT1 are enriched in the SV fraction compared with homogenate, whereas the enrichment in the vacuolar proton pump due to its occurrence on a variety of organelles was less pronounced (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5The vacuolar proton pump, synaptophysin, and VGLUT1 in homogenate and SV under LD condition. Homogenate or SVs were prepared at the given ZT time points and analyzed for the presence of VGLUT1, synaptophysin (Syp), and the 116-kDa subunit of vacuolar proton pump (VPP 116 kDa). Individual samples from two different sets with either ZT24/0 and ZT6 (light phase of a LD cycle, white bar) or ZT12 and ZT18 (dark phase of a DD cycle, black bar) are shown. All homogenate fractions were extracted by Triton X-114 partitioning. The following ratios were obtained: VGLUT1 to Syp in homogenate was between 1.1 and 1.0 for all conditions, for SV ZT24/0, 0.83; ZT6, 0.33; wild type and ZT24/0, 0.83; ZT6, 0.7 Per2Brdm1 mice and ZT12, 0.75; ZT 18, 0.6; wild type and ZT12, 1.3; and ZT18, 0.7 Per2Brdm1mice. VPP to Syp varied between 0.45 and 0.46 for all conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn the present work we showed that the amount of VGLUT1 in a given vesicular fraction oscillates during a 24-h LD cycle. This oscillation depends on light and requires the presence of a functional Per2 gene. The data have two implications. They describe for the first time a link between the circadian system, light input, and synaptic efficiency. In addition and equally important they show that the presynaptic terminal can change the equipment of integral membrane proteins of SV by a sorting mechanism in an activity-dependent manner, in this case based on circadian rhythmicity and light input.Light-induced information is transduced from the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nucleus eliciting glutamate release at the synapse of the retinohypothalamic tract. This signal is the major cue to induce resetting of clock phase in mammals. Interestingly, Per2Brdm1 mutant mice have a defect in delaying clock phase, which is thought to be because of an altered glutamatergic signaling in these animals (4Spanagel R. Pendyala G. Abarca C.

https://openalex.org/W2033085502,"We examined the roles of type 1 and type 2 calsequestrins (CSQ1 and CSQ2) in stored Ca2+ release of C2C12 skeletal muscle myotubes. Transduction of C2C12 myoblasts with CSQ1 or CSQ2 small interfering RNAs effectively reduced the expression of targeted CSQ protein to near undetectable levels. As compared with control infected or CSQ1 knockdown myotubes, CSQ2 and CSQ1/CSQ2 knockdown myotubes had significantly reduced stored Ca2+ release evoked by activators of intracellular Ca2+ release channel/ryanodine receptor (10 mm caffeine, 200 μm 4-chloro-m-cresol, or 10 mm KCl). Thus, CSQ1 is not essential for effective stored Ca2+ release in C2C12 myotubes despite our in vitro studies suggesting that CSQ1 may enhance ryanodine receptor channel activity. To determine the basis of the reduced stored Ca2+ release in CSQ2 knockdown myotubes, we performed immunoblot analyses and found a significant reduction in both sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor proteins in CSQ2 and CSQ1/CSQ2 knockdown myotubes. Moreover, these knockdown myotubes exhibited reduced Ca2+ uptake and reduced stored Ca2+ release by UTP (400 μm) that activates a different family of intracellular Ca2+ release channels (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors). Taken together, our data suggest that knocking down CSQ2, but not CSQ1, leads to reduced Ca2+ storage and release in C2C12 myotubes.

Subsequently, the sequestration of cytosolic Ca2+ back into the SR by the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) leads to muscle relaxation (3Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In addition to RyRs and SERCA, a number of SR proteins also play a significant role in Ca2+ storage and release and therefore may be important in striated muscle function. In this regard, the high-capacity, low-affinity Ca2+-binding protein calsequestrin (CSQ) has drawn increased attention. Although CSQ is thought to increase Ca2+ storage capacity of SR in striated muscles (4MacLennan D.H. Wong P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The importance of CSQ2 in skeletal muscle, however, is not well understood. To better understand the roles of CSQ1 and CSQ2 in stored Ca2+ release of skeletal muscle, we used siRNAs to knockdown CSQ1 and/or CSQ2 in 8-day-old C2C12 myotubes that otherwise robustly expressed both CSQ isoforms. After confirming the efficacies as well as specificities of our gene-silencing approach, RyR channel activities in the presence or absence of each CSQ isoform were examined using [3H]ryanodine binding and single channel recordings. In addition, stored Ca2+ release in different experimental groups of C2C12 myotubes evoked by activators of RyRs was assessed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Although our in vitro studies suggest that CSQ1 may enhance RyR channel activity, CSQ1 knockdown myotubes unexpectedly had preserved stored Ca2+ release evoked by activators of RyRs. In contrast, CSQ2 and CSQ1/CSQ2 knockdown myotubes had significantly reduced stored Ca2+ release to the same RyR activators. Our subsequent data suggest that CSQ2, but not CSQ1, maintains type 1 SERCA (SERCA1) protein expression and Ca2+ sequestration activity in C2C12 myotubes. Knocking down CSQ2 therefore leads to reduced Ca2+ storage and thus reduced stored Ca2+ release in these cells. In addition, a deficiency in CSQ2 may lead to reduced RyR1 expression in C2C12 myotubes thus further compromising their stored Ca2+ release.

Materials—Immature C2C12 skeletal muscle cells (myoblasts) derived from normal adult C3H mouse leg muscles were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Double strand recombinant adenoassociated viral (rAAV) vector was generously provided by Dr. Douglas McCarty (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). Fluo 4-AM was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and Fura 2-AM was purchased from TEF LABS (Austin, TX). Goat polyclonal anti-IP3R2 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-IP3R3 from BD Biosciences, and anti-junctin from ProSci Incorporated (San Diego, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-RyR1/RyR3 IgG (34C clone) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa). A rabbit polyclonal IgG raised against a 13-amino acid region specific for RyR3 and a C-terminal cysteine (KKRRRGQKVEKPEC) was prepared as described previously (30Protasi F. Takekura H. Wang Y.

All other primary antibodies were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). [3H]Ryanodine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Phospholipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless specified otherwise. Cell Culture—C2C12 myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× antibiotics/antimycotics. Myoblasts were seeded at a concentration of 6 × 105 cells per 10-cm plate and cultured for 48 h to reach 100% confluence (defined as day 0 myotubes). To induce myogenic differentiation, the growth medium was then changed to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum and 1× antibiotics/antimycotics) on day 0. The differentiation medium was changed everyday subsequently. Construction of Vector, Packaging, and Purification of rAAV—The oligonucleotides encoding the specific siRNA for each CSQ isoform were inserted into pSilencer-1.0 vector (Ambion, Austin TX) downstream of the U6 promoter using ApaI and EcoRI sites. U6 promoter-driven expression cassettes were inserted into rAAV vector (ptrs-U1a-RFP-U6) using the KpnI and NotI sites. The ptrs-U1a-RFP-U6 vector contains red fluorescent protein and was kindly provided by Dr. Douglas McCarty (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). The resulting vectors are termed rAAV-CSQ1 and rAAV-CSQ2. The sequences of oligonucleotides encoding the CSQ1 and CSQ2 siRNA were 5′-CTGAAGAAGACAGCGTTTATTCAAGAGATAAACGCTGTCTTCTTCAG-3′ and 5′-CAGTGGAGATCGTGAATAATTCAAGAGATTATTCACGATCTCCACTG-3′. BLAST searches confirmed that the selected oligonucleotide sequences were not homologous to any other genes. A control sequence of 5′-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTTTCAAGAGAACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAA-3′ was used to construct rAAV-control as a negative control. Serum type 2 double strand rAAVs were produced by the triple plasmid cotransfection method and purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and on cesium chloride gradients (31Li J. Samulski R.J.

Recombinant AAV Transduction—For rAAV transduction, C2C12 myoblasts were seeded at a concentration of 6 × 105 cells per 10-cm plate or 1 × 105 per well in 6-well plates. About 24 h after seeding, myoblasts were infected with rAAV carrying the CSQ-siRNA silencing cassette at 1 × 104 particles/cell and transferred into differentiation medium 24 h after infection. The differentiation medium was changed everyday subsequently. Immunoblot and Immunofluorescence Analyses—Unless otherwise indicated, 8-day-old C2C12 myotubes grown on 6-well plates were harvested, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in RIPA buffer plus protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Diagnostics), and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble material. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA assay. Twenty μg of lysate was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with antibodies for CSQ1, CSQ2, triadin 95, junctin, α1-DHPR, RyRs, IP3Rs, and SERCA1. Western blots were developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine or enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified using Kodak Digital Science ID Image Analysis Software. For immunofluorescence analysis, 8-day-old C2C12 myotubes fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde were permeabilized with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.3 m sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Triton X-100, and incubated with anti-CSQ1 or anti-CSQ2 antibody, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody. Images were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Preparation of Membrane Fractions—C2C12 myotubes grown on 10-cm tissue culture dishes were washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors by removal from the plates by scraping. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in the above solution without EDTA, again pelleted, and stored at –80 °C. A crude membrane fraction was obtained by homogenizing the cells in 0.15 m KCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7, solution containing 0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm glutathione (oxidized), and protease inhibitors with the use of a Tekmar homogenizer (6 s at 13,500 rpm). Cell homogenates were centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g, pellets were resuspended in 0.15 m KCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7, solution containing 0.3 m sucrose and protease inhibitors, and stored at –135 °C. Proteoliposomes containing purified rabbit skeletal muscle RyR1 ion channels were prepared in the presence of protease inhibitors (33Lee H.B. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1983; 258: 1197-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) CSQs were purified as described. Stored Ca2+ Release—Stored Ca2+ release was determined using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye Fluo 4-AM. 8-Day-old C2C12 myotubes grown on glass coverslips were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and loaded with 5 μm Fluo 4-AM for 1 h at 37°C in Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit (KRH) buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4,6mm glucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2,2mm CaCl2, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After loading, cells were rinsed with KRH buffer to remove non-hydrolyzed fluorophore and kept in KRH buffer for 30 min to complete de-esterification. Individual cells in Ca2+-free KRH buffer (2 mm CaCl2 was replaced by 0.5 mm EGTA) were defined as regions of interest, and average fluorescence was measured by using the program ImageMaster (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ). Resting calcium levels were monitored with Fura-2. Cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura 2-AM and excited alternatively at 340 and 380 nm. The fluorescence emission was collected at 510 nm. Resting intracellular calcium concentrations were calculated using the equation: [Ca2+]i = Kd (F380 max/F380 min)(R – Rmin)/(Rmax – R). A dissociation constant (Kd) of 224 nm (35Grynkiewicz G.

A. 1988; 85: 5754-5758Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was used for the binding of calcium to Fura-2 at 37 °C. Rmax and Rmin were determined in each experimental group by the consecutive addition of 10 μm ionomycin and 50 mm EGTA. Restoring Ca2+ Release in CSQ2 Knockdown Myotubes—To determine whether CSQ2 is specifically responsible for the decreased stored Ca2+ release of C2C12 myotubes treated with CSQ2 siRNA, we performed additional experiments. We first amplified CSQ2 cDNAs from a mouse skeletal muscle cDNA library (Clontech) by PCR and then constructed the CSQ2 cDNAs into PcIneo vector using NheI and NotI sites. 3 μg of PcIneo-CSQ2 plasmid DNA, 1 μg of ptrs-U1a-RFP vector (as a reporter), and 10 nm chemically synthesized siRNA specific for CSQ2 (see above targeting sequence) (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) were then mixed in 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and co-transtected into C2C12 myoblasts in each well of the 6-well plate. In two other groups of C2C12 myoblasts, PcIneo-CSQ2 was replaced by the same amount of PcIneo vector in one group and CSQ2 siRNA was omitted in the other group. The transfection efficiency was about 5%. C2C12 myoblasts were then allowed to differentiate over 8 days and myotubes with red fluorescence were examined for caffeine-induced stored Ca2+ release as described above. [3H]Ryanodine Binding—Unless otherwise indicated, crude membrane fractions prepared from C2C12 cells were incubated with 2.5 nm [3H]ryanodine in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 250 mm KCl, 150 mm sucrose, 1 mm glutathione (oxidized), 20 μm leupeptin, and 200 μm Pefabloc, and the indicated free Ca2+ concentrations. Nonspecific binding was determined using a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled ryanodine. After 20 h at 24 °C, aliquots of the samples were diluted with 8.5 volumes of ice-cold water and placed on Whatman GF/B filters preincubated with 2% polyethyleneimine in water. Filters were washed with 3× 5ml of ice-cold 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm K-PIPES, pH 7.0. Radioactivity remaining on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting to obtain bound [3H]ryanodine. Bmax values of [3H]ryanodine binding were determined by incubating membranes for 4 h at 24°C with a saturating concentration of [3H]ryanodine (30 nm) in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.6 m KCl, 0.15 m sucrose, 20 μm leupeptin, 200 μm Pefabloc, and 100 μm Ca2+. Specific [3H]ryanodine binding was determined as described above. 45Ca2+ Uptake—ATP-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake by C2C12 membranes was determined using a filtration method. 45Ca2+ uptake was initiated by placing membranes in 0.15 m KCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, solution containing 5 mm ATP, 8 mm Mg2+, 5 mm Koxalate (a Ca2+ precipitating agent to increase Ca2+ uptake capacity (37Martonosi A. Feretos R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 648-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), 10 μm ruthenium red (to inhibit RyRs (38Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32680-32691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)), 5 mm NaN3 (to inhibit mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake), 1 mm EGTA, and 45Ca2+ to yield a free Ca2+ concentration of 0.5 μm. To obtain 45Ca2+ uptake rates, aliquots were placed at 2.5, 5, and 10 min on 0.45 μm Millipore filters under vacuum and rinsed with three 3-ml volumes of ice-cold 0.175 m KCl, 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, solution. Radioactivity remaining with the vesicles on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Single Channel Recordings—Single channel measurements were performed using Mueller-Rudin-type planar lipid bilayers containing a 5:3:2 mixture of bovine brain phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine (25 mg of total phospholipid/ml of n-decane) (39Wang Y. Xu L. Pasek D.A. Gillespie D. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 256-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). SR vesicles of 8-day-old C2C12 myotubes were added to the cis (SR cytosolic side) chamber of a bilayer apparatus and fused in the presence of an osmotic gradient (250 mm cis KCl, 20 mm trans KCl in 20 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.4, with 2 μm Ca2+). Amounts of membranes were adjusted to obtain single channel activities not more than 30 min after their addition. After appearance of channel activity, trans (SR lumenal) KCl concentration was increased to 250 mm to prevent further fusion of membranes. The trans side of the bilayer was defined as ground. The large cytosolic regulatory region of the channels faced the cis chamber in a majority (>98%) of the recordings (40Xu L. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2302-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Purified canine cardiac and rabbit skeletal muscle CSQs were added to the trans chamber. Electrical signals were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and analyzed as described (40Xu L. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2302-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Biochemical Assays and Data Analyses—Free Ca2+ concentrations were obtained by including in the solution the appropriate amounts of Ca2+ and EGTA as determined using the stability constants and published computer program (41Schoenmakers T.J. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 870-879PubMed Google Scholar). Free Ca2+ concentrations of ≥1 μm were verified with the use of a Ca2+ selective electrode. Results are given as mean ± S.E. Significance of differences in data (p < 0.05) were determined using Student's t test. Efficiencies and Specificities of Knocking Down CSQ1 and CSQ2 in C2C12 Myotubes—C2C12 myoblasts were infected with rAVV vectors containing the sequences for red fluorescent protein, U6 promoter (ptrs-U1a-RFP-U6), and CSQ1 or CSQ2 specific siRNA. These C2C12 myoblasts were then allowed to differentiate into multinucleated myotubes over 8 days (Fig. 1) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In addition, C2C12 myoblasts were doubly infected to knockdown both CSQ isoforms or were infected with rAAV vector that contained a control oligonucleotide sequence. Transduction efficiencies among these four groups of C2C12 myotubes were all near 100% as judged by the red fluorescent protein expression of the myotubes. As shown Fig. 1, A–D, every myotube expressed the red fluorescent protein when examined using confocal microscopy. In our preliminary studies, we had found that C2C12 myotubes robustly expressed both CSQ isoforms after 6 or more days of culture in differentiation medium (e.g. Fig. 2D). The cellular distribution of CSQ isoforms in 8-day-old myotubes was then examined after labeling these cells with anti-CSQ1 or anti-CSQ2 antibody and followed by Alexa 488-conjugated secondary bodies. As shown in Fig. 1, E and F, the two CSQ isoforms had a similar cellular distribution in 8-day-old (control) myotubes. Transductions with rAAV-CSQ1 and rAAV-CSQ2 reduced the corresponding CSQ isoform to nearly undetectable levels in 8-day-old C2C12 myotubes. Representative results are shown in Fig. 1, G and H (background green fluorescence is barely noticeable). The efficacies of knocking down the two CSQ isoforms in C2C12 myotubes were confirmed by immunoblot analyses. As with our immunofluorescence studies, CSQ1 and CSQ2 proteins (both had an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa on gels) in myotubes were reduced to undetectable levels by their corresponding siRNAs (Fig. 2, A–C). Also notable were the specificities of CSQ siRNAs. That is, the level of CSQ2 protein was not affected in C2C12 myotubes infected with rAAV-CSQ1 and similarly the level of CSQ1 protein was not affected in C2C12 myotubes infected with rAAV-CSQ2 (Fig. 2, A and B). These results clearly show that infecting C2C12 myoblasts with rAAV encoding CSQ1- or CSQ2-specific siRNA sequence results in the specific knockdown of corresponding CSQ protein in C2C12 myotubes. These results also validated the isoform specificities of anti-CSQ antibodies used in our immunoblot and immunofluorescence studies. Furthermore, these results indicate that knocking down one particular CSQ isoform does not lead to a compensatory overexpression of the other isoform. The expression levels of CSQ1 and CSQ2 proteins in different stages of C2C12 myotubes were investigated using a combination of immunoblot and protein densitometry analyses. Immunoblot studies revealed that CSQ1 and CSQ2 were absent in 1-day-old myotubes (Fig. 2D, lane 1). CSQ2 was first detected in 3-day-old myotubes (lane 3) but by day 6 both CSQ isoforms were easily detectable (lane 5). The expression level of CSQ1 was not altered in 3- or 6-day-old C2C12 cells infected with rAAV-CSQ2 (Fig. 2D, upper panel, compare lanes 3 and 4, and 5 and 6). Conversely, transduction with rAAV-CSQ1 had no noticeable effect on CSQ2 levels in 3- and 6-day-old C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 2D, lower panel). We were able to estimate the relative expression of CSQ isoforms in 8-day-old myotubes because our knockdown method is highly efficacious and knocking down one CSQ isoform does not lead to a compensatory overexpression of the other isoform (Fig. 2, A–D). Densitometry analyses of the Coomassie Blue-stained gels showed that, as compared with rAAV-control infection, rAAV-CSQ1 infection reduced the CSQ protein band by 61 ± 4% in 8-day-old myotubes (not shown). In comparison, rAAV-CSQ2 transduction reduced the CSQ protein band by 31 ± 5% (n = 3). These data suggest that 8-day-old C2C12 myotubes expressed CSQ1 and CSQ2 at a protein ratio of ∼2:1 despite the apparent higher signals of CSQ2 bands in immunoblots (Fig. 2D).

https://openalex.org/W2004933593,"The K+-Cl– cotransporter (KCC) isoforms constitute a functionally heterogeneous group of ion carriers. Emerging evidence suggests that the C terminus (Ct) of these proteins is important in conveying isoform-specific traits and that it may harbor interacting sites for 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced effectors. In this study, we have generated KCC2-KCC4 chimeras to identify key functional domains in the Ct of these carriers and single point mutations to determine whether canonical protein kinase C sites underlie KCC2-specific behaviors. Functional characterization of wild-type (wt) and mutant carriers in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed for the first time that the KCCs do not exhibit similar sensitivities to changes in osmolality and that this distinguishing feature as well as differences in transport activity under both hypotonic and isotonic conditions are in part determined by the residue composition of the distal Ct. At the same time, several mutations in this domain and in the proximal Ct of the KCCs were found to generate allosteric-like effects, suggesting that the regions analyzed are important in defining conformational ensembles and that isoform-specific structural configurations could thus account for variant functional traits as well. Characterization of the other mutants in this work showed that KCC2 is not inhibited by PMA through phosphorylation of its canonical protein kinase C sites. Intriguingly, however, the substitutions N728S and S940A were seen to alter the PMA effect paradoxically, suggesting again that allosteric changes in the Ct are important determinants of transport activity and, furthermore, that the structural configuration of this domain can convey specific functional traits by defining the accessibility of cotransporter sites to regulatory intermediates such as PMA-induced effectors.

In their active state, the KCCs usually generate net outward movement of K+-Cl– ions because of large intra-to-extracellular K+ gradients across the surface of most animal cells and because transport stoichiometries are probably 1K+:1Cl– (13Jennings M.L. Adame M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C825-C832Crossref Google Scholar, 14Gamba G. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). For this reason, and given that K+-Cl– cotransport is enhanced under conditions that lead to cell swelling, the KCCs are believed to play a key role in regulatory volume decrease responses (15Eveloff J.

To this effect, it has been claimed that KCC4-mediated Cl– efflux in renal intercalated cells promotes secondary HCO–3 basolateral efflux via an anion exchanger (24Boettger T. Hubner C.A. Maier H. Rust M.B. Beck F.X. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2002; 416: 874-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and KCC2-mediated Cl– efflux in neuronal cells, secondary GABA responses (25Rivera C. Voipio J.

The importance of the KCCs in these processes is suggested more specifically by the behavior of a KCC4 –/– mouse, which was found to exhibit renal tubular acidosis (24Boettger T. Hubner C.A. Maier H. Rust M.B. Beck F.X. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2002; 416: 874-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and a KCC2 –/– mouse, which was found to exhibit generalized epilepsy (26Woo N.S. Lu J.

The mechanisms that lead to KCC deactivation or activation during a change in cell volume and Cl–i are still poorly understood despite a large number of studies on the subject of K+-Cl– cotransport regulation. Based on the effect of various pharmacological agents, a popular model that has emerged over the years is one in which K+-Cl– cotransport is reduced through carrier phosphorylation and induced through carrier dephosphorylation, and in which such modifications result from the concerted action of protein kinases and protein phosphatases at relevant regulatory sites (14Gamba G.

Physiol. 2006; 290: C134-C142Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), the specific isoenzymes involved have remained elusive. Recently, we have found that KCC2- or KCC4-mediated activity is inhibited by 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), suggesting that PKC is one of the candidate enzymes. 4M. J. Bergeron and P. Isenring, unpublished results. Carrier loci with which such enzymes interact have also remained unidentified, but a few studies suggest a central role for the C terminus (Ct) in this regard. For example, Strange et al. (39Strange K. Singer T.D. Morrison R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C860-C867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have found that a Y1087D mutation in KCC2, a neuronal-specific isoform that displays robust constitutive activity under isotonic conditions, leads to a large decrease in KCC activity. Along the same line, Mercado et al. (40Mercado A. Broumand V. Zandi-Nejad K. Enck A.H. Mount D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1016-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have concluded from functional characterizations of KCC2-KCC4 chimeras that constitutive activity for KCC2 is conveyed through a unique 15-residue stretch (amino acids 1021–1035) in the distal Ct. For this reason, they termed the stretch in question the “ISO segment.” In this work, the role of the Ct was explored further by analyzing distinctive sets of KCC2-KCC4 chimeras as well as selected mutants in which putative PKC sites were altered. Our studies led to the identification of protein segments that play unique functional roles but not that of the underlying the PMA effect through canonical PKC phosphorylation sites. Our studies have also revealed that the Ct may impart isoform-specific functional traits by adopting defined conformational ensembles and that, for KCC2, such ensembles are probably more important than the ISO segment per se in determining transport activity under isotonic conditions. Chemicals, reagents, or kits were from several suppliers. They included: 86RbCl (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the mouse anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science), the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse anti-IgG and the Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse anti-IgG (Amersham Biosciences), EZ-link® Sulfo-NHS-Biotin and ImmunoPure Immobilized Streptavidin® (Pierce), as well as various salts, sucrose, ouabain, furosemide, bumetanide, PMA, 4α-PMA, okadaic acid (OA) and oligonucleotides (Sigma). Vectors and constructs were all propagated in XL1 blue cells (Stratagene). KCC Constructs—A total of sixteen different cDNAs was used. They were subcloned in the vector pGEM-HE or Pol1, which are designed to generate cRNA off of cDNA inserts and to increase the stability and translatability of transcription products in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Both these vectors contain a T7 promoter, a cloning site flanked by the X. laevis β-globin-untranslated regions, a poly(A) tract, and an NheI linearizing site. In all experiments, cDNA amplification and mutagenesis were carried out using the pGEM-HE- or Pol1-based plasmids. c-myc-tagged Wild-type (wt) Rat (rt) KCC2 (KCC2wt) and wt Mouse (ms) KCC4 (KCC4wt)—These constructs, provided to us by Dr. Eric Delpire and coworkers (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN), were generated from wt rtKCC2/pBF and wt msKCC4/pGEM-HE. The insert of the first construct consists of a cDNA that contains 3351 bp of open reading frame and more than 373 bp of untranslated regions, whereas that of the other construct consists of a cDNA that contains 3252 bp of open reading frame and >250 bp of untranslated regions. Before adding the c-myc tag to wt rtKCC2, the insert was moved from pBF to Pol1 as an XbaI-HindIII fragment. The tag per se (MEQKLISEEDL) was introduced in front of the coding sequences of wt rtKCC2/Pol1 and wt msKCC4/pGEM-HE. This task was achieved by 1) cutting the wt constructs at restriction sites that are very close to the first ATG (XbaI-NarI for wt rtKCC2/Pol1 and XmaI-DrdI for wt msKCC4/pGEM-HE) and 2) ligating the larger fragments with prehybridized complementary oligonucleotides (Table 1) designed to encode the c-Myc tag and possess single-stranded cohesive ends XbaI-NarI-compatible (wt KCC2/Pol1) or XmaI-DrdI-compatible (KCC4/pGEM-HE). The c-myc-tagged wt msKCC4/pGEM-HE construct was modified once more by removing nucleotides between c-myc and the first ATG to generate an in-frame tag carrier-coding sequence. The latter modification was carried out through pairs of oligonucleotides (shown in Table 1) using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).TABLE 1OligonucleotidesOligonucleotide sequencesA) KCC2 c-myc tagStc gag ATG GAG CAG AAG CTG ATA TCT GAG GAA GAC CTC GggAScg ccC GAG GTC TTC CTC AGA TAT CAG CTT CTG CTC CAT c KCC2Bst1107ISg gag tgg ggg gat gGT ATA Cga ggc ctg tct ctcASgag aga cag gcc tcG TAT ACc atc ccc cca ctc c KCC2AvrIISc caa tcc ggg ggC CTA GGg gga ctg caa cac aac acASgt gtt gtg ttg cag tcc cCC TAG Gcc ccc gga ttg g KCC2EcoRVSg cac gag agc GAT ATC tca gca tac accASggt gta tgc tga GAT ATC gct ctc gtg c KCC2T34ASc aac agc acg gac GCG gag aag ggg agASct ccc ctt ctc CGC gtc cgt gct gtt g KCC2S728NSgg gca gag gag AAT atc cgg cgcASgcg ccg gat ATT ctc ctc tgc cc KCC2T787ASg gag gat cat cag GCA tgg agg aac ttc atc gASc gat gaa gtt cct cca TGC ctg atg atc ctc c KCC2S940ASgaa tct cgg ggc GCC att cgg aggAScct ccg aat GGC gcc ccg aga ttc KCC2S1034ASg gac ttc ttc GCC atg aag ccg gASc cgg ctt cat GGC gaa gaa gtc c KCC24-2-2(N728S)Sg agg gct gaa gag AGT atc cgg tct cASg aga ccg gat ACT ctc ttc agc cct c KCC24-2-2(N728D)Sg agg gct gaa gag GAT atc cgg tct cASg aga ccg gat ATC ctc ttc agc cct c Sequencing primersStaatacgactcactataggg (T7 promoter)Sg gca gat aat cct ttc gcc tgg aag aac ttt gta g (KCC4)ASc tac aaa gtt ctt cca ggc gaa agg att atc tgc c (KCC4)Sggc ttc aaa gac ctc ttc gcc cta aag ccg gac cag tc (KCC4)ASga ctg gtc cgg ctt tag ggc gaa gag gtc ttt gaa gcc (KCC4)B) KCC4 c-myc tag step 1Sccggg ATG GAG CAG AAG CTG ATA TCT GAG GAA GAC CTC g gac agc aASctgtcc GAG GTC TTC CTC AGA TAT CAG CTT CTG CTC CAT c c-myc tag step 2Sg ctg ata tct gag gaa gac ctc aca gca gag tct aac ggAScc gtt aga ctc tgc tgt gag gtc ttc ctc aga tat cag c KCC4Bst1107ISg ggg gat gGT ATA Cgg ggc ctgAScag gcc ccG TAT ACc atc ccc c KCC4AvrIIScg gct ggC CTA GGt ggg atg aaa cacASgtg ttt cat ccc aCC TAG Gcc agc cg KCC4EcoRVSg gtt gaa aat GAT ATC tcc gcc ttc acc tat gagASctc ata ggt gaa ggc gga GAT ATC att ttc aac c Sequencing primerStaatacgactcactataggg (T7 promoter) Open table in a new tab Tagged Chimeras: KCC24-2-2, KCC22-4-2, KCC22-2-4, KCC42-4-4, KCC44-2-4, and KCC44-4-2—These mutants were engineered by fragment exchange after creating silent restriction sites in the Ct of KCC2wt and KCC4wt using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit and pairs of oligonucleotides (Table 1). The three sites used to generate junction points were Bst1107I, AvrII, and EcorV at bp 2046–2051, 2401–2406, and 2804–2809 in the KCC2wt open reading frame, and 2063–2068, 2418–2423, and 2821–2826 in the KCC4wt open reading frame. In KCC2wt, they correspond to residues Gly644/Ile645, Leu763/Gly764, and Asp897/Ile898, and in KCC4wt, to residues Gly664/Ile665, Leu783/Gly784, and Asp917/Ile918 (see arrows in Fig. 1). In this work, the chimeras are termed KCC2x-x-x or KCC4x-x-x, where the first, second, and third “x” in subscripted font correspond, respectively, to the proximal, middle, and distal third of the Ct, and where “x” is assigned the number 2 or 4 to designate the isoform from which each third is derived. Single Point Substitutions: KCC2(T34A), KCC2(S728N), KCC2(T787A), KCC2(S940A), KCC2(S1034A), KCC2(T34A-S728N-T787A-S940A-S1034A) or KCC2(0PKC), KCC24-2-2(N728S), and KCC24-2-2(N728D)—The first six mutants consist of wt KCC2s in which putative PKC phosphorylation sites that are conserved among species and occur in cytosolic domains were altered either one by one or in combination by generating (S/T) → (A/N) mutations. In KCC2wt and KCC4wt, one of these sites is in the predicted N terminus (Nt), whereas the other sites are in the predicted Ct (Fig. 1). Other putative PKC sites are present in KCC2wt and KCC4wt, but they are not conserved among species or they are predicted to occur in the central domain. The other mutants consist of KCC24-2-2 chimeras in which additional changes were made in the proximal Ct by creating a PKC site or a Asn → Asp substitution. Except for KCC20PKC, all of the substitutions were generated from KCC2wt or KCC24-2-2 using pairs of mutagenic oligonucleotides (Table 1B) and the QuikChange mutagenesis kit. They were called KCC2(y)s, where “y” in parenthesis is used to designate the substitution that was generated based on the amino acid number in the template carrier. As for KCC20PKC, it was generated in four steps: 1) by recreating the S1034A substitution as above but from the template KCC2(S940A), 2) by recreating the T787A substitution also as above but from KCC2(S940A-S1034A), 3) by ligating the XbaI-HincII fragment of KCC2T34A to that of KCC2(S728N), and 4) by ligating the SfiI-HindIII fragment of KCC2(T34A-S728N) to that of KCC2(T787A-S940A-S1034A). Expression of KCCs—Defolliculated stage V–VI oocytes were generally each injected with ∼10 ng of KCC2wt-, KCC4wt-, or mutant KCC-derived cRNAs, and maintained for ∼3 days at 18 °C in Barth's (B) medium (Table 2) plus 125 μm furosemide. In each of the conditions tested, groups of oocytes were also injected with H2O alone to determine the component of fluxes that is due to endogenous KCC-mediated cotransport.TABLE 2Composition of flux solutionsMediumSolution[ion]OsmolarityNa+Rb+Cl-Ca2+Mg2+PO42−SO42−HEPaHEP, HEPES; GLUC, gluconate; and SUC, sucrose.GLUCaHEP, HEPES; GLUC, gluconate; and SUC, sucrose.SUCaHEP, HEPES; GLUC, gluconate; and SUC, sucrose.mmosmRNormal Cl-/isotonic8758622111000194LLow Cl-/isotonic563.25.21.31.30.60.66.45069194LHLow Cl-/hypotonic563.25.21.31.30.60.66.4500125LOΔLow Cl-/variable osm563.25.21.31.30.60.66.450ΔΔOΔNormal Cl-/variable osm563.255.21.31.30.60.66.40ΔΔWWash medium19738221110780194bK+ was used instead of Rb+.BBarth medium1001900.70.800.81000207bK+ was used instead of Rb+.a HEP, HEPES; GLUC, gluconate; and SUC, sucrose.b K+ was used instead of Rb+.

The isotope 86Rb+ was used as tracer, and all experiments were carried out at ∼22 °C with several types of media (Table 2) adjusted to a pH of 7.4. One of these mediums, called low Cl–/hypotonic (LH), is hypoosmolar relative to the X. laevis plasma, whereas three of these media, called low Cl– (or L), normal Cl– (R) and wash (W), are approximately isoosmolar. In one experiment, two other groups of media, termed low Cl–/osmolality variable (LOΔ) and near normal Cl–/osmolality variable (OΔ), were used to determine the sensitivity of certain carriers to hypoosmotic swelling at 5 mm Cl– (KCC2wt, KCC4wt, KCC22-2-4, and KCC24-2-2) and at 55 mm Cl– (KCC2wt and KCC4wt). For all of these media, sucrose was used to adjust osmolality, whereas gluconate and/or SO2–4 were used as replacement of Cl–. Before the flux assay, furosemide was first removed through rinses in large volumes of medium B. Next, oocytes were subjected to two consecutive incubation steps, one of variable duration in medium R, L, LH, OΔ, or LOΔ (with or without 250 μm furosemide, with or without 0.1–1.0 μm PMA or 4α-PMA, with or without 0.1 μm OA) and another of 45 min in medium R (plus 1–2 μCi/ml 86Rb+, plus 10 μm ouabain, with or without 5 μm bumetanide, with or without 250 μm furosemide). It should be noted that, in most studies, bumetanide was added at low concentrations during the second incubation to inhibit Na+-K+-Cl– cotransport while leaving K+-Cl– cotransport intact (4Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 21Guizouarn H. Motais R. Am. J.

Fluxes were ended with several rinses in medium W (plus 10 μm ouabain, plus 250 μm furosemide, plus 250 μm bumetanide), and oocytes were transferred to 96-well plates prefilled with 2% SDS and scintillation fluid. After a brief stabilization period, 86Rb+ was detected with the TopCountNXT counter (Packard Instrument Co.). For each condition tested, counts among 3–12 oocytes (typically ∼8 oocytes) were averaged and transposed into flux rates (FRs) based on the equation: FRs = (counts/oocyte × [85Rb+] in flux medium) ÷ ([counts] × incubation time in flux medium), assuming that membrane surface areas among stage V–VI oocytes are the same. In all experiments, FRs measured in KCC-expressing oocytes were also converted into cotransporter-specific FRs (FRsKCC), where FRsKCC = (FRs without furosemide for KCC-expressing oocytes–FRs with furosemide for KCC-expressing oocytes) – (FRs without furosemide for H2O-injected oocytes – FRs"

Pre-mRNA splicing, the removal of introns from mRNA precursors, is indispensable to the expression of most eukaryotic genes. The splicing of mRNA is catalyzed by spliceosome, a large machine formed by an ordered interaction of several small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), 3The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; PPIL1, peptidyl prolyl isomerase-like protein 1; SKIP, SKI-interacting protein; SKIP172, N-terminal fragment of SKIP-(1–172); nSKIP, N-terminal fragment of SKIP-(59–129); NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; GST, glutathione S-transferase.3The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; PPIL1, peptidyl prolyl isomerase-like protein 1; SKIP, SKI-interacting protein; SKIP172, N-terminal fragment of SKIP-(1–172); nSKIP, N-terminal fragment of SKIP-(59–129); NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; GST, glutathione S-transferase.

The stable intermediate complexes are the A, B, and C complexes. During the spliceosome maturation process, the most decisive step is the conversion from non-active complex B to the catalytically active spliceosome B*. The activated complex B* undergoes the first catalytic step of splicing and then forms complex C. Prior to the activation of the spliceosome and during the splicing process, a number of conformational rearrangements take place. Recently, human 45 S activated spliceosome (complex B*) and 35 S U5 snRNP have been isolated by immunoaffinity purification and characterized by mass spectrometry (3Makarov E.M. Makarova O.V.

Comparison of their protein components with those of other snRNP and spliceosomal complexes revealed a major change in protein composition. More than 100 proteins were identified in the 45 S activated spliceosome, 80 of which are known splicing factors.

It has been demonstrated that Prp45p, ortholog of SKIP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is associated with spliceosome throughout the splicing process and is essential for pre-mRNA splicing (13Diehl B.E. Pringle J.R. Genetics. 1991; 127: 287-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neither SKIP nor PPIL1 is stably associated with U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNPs nor are they present in pre-spliceosomes; they are recruited before catalytic step 1 and might also function during activation of spliceosome (3Makarov E.M.

Hamplova L. Puta F. Folk P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1521: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) between SnwA and CypE, which are postulated as the orthologs of SKIP and PPIL1 in D. discoideum, respectively. Nevertheless, no direct evidence shows that PPIL1 can bind to SKIP directly, and the molecular mechanism of the interaction is still unknown. To investigate the interaction of PPIL1 with SKIP, we solved the solution structure of PPIL1 by NMR and have provided the kinetic constants by PPIase assay. GST pulldown experiments combined with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements revealed the N-terminal of SKIP-(59–129) could associate with PPIL1 in vitro tightly. Furthermore, we provided experimental evidence for the formation of PPIL1-cyclosporin A-nSKIP ternary complex by NMR titration and chemical shift perturbation experiments. According to the results of perturbation, we mapped the interfaces of PPIL1 in binding to cyclosporin A and SKIP. PPIL1-nSKIP exhibits a novel interaction mode in contrast with other known cyclophilin-protein interactions. The biological implication of the association in spliceosome rearrangement during activation is discussed. Our results implicate more complicated roles that spliceosomal cyclophilin may play during the activation of spliceosome. Expression and Purification and Isotope Labeling of PPIL1—The hPPIL1 cDNA was obtained by PCR from human CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell cDNA library cloned in-frame into the NdeI/XhoI sites of pET-22b (+) (Novagen). It was then transformed into the Escherichia coli expression strain BL21 (DE3). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani medium containing 100 mg/liter of ampicillin. Briefly, saturated Luria Bertani was diluted (1:300, v/v) in M9 minimal medium containing 0.05% 15NH4Cl and/or 0.25% [13C]glucose and incubated at 37 °C. Target protein expression was induced by addition of 0.8 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to mid-log phase cultures (A600, 0.6–0.8). The culture was shaken at 20 °C overnight. After 20 h of additional growth, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl. Cells were disrupted by sonication, and debris was spun down at 15,000 rpm, 4 °C for 0.5 h in a Beckman centrifuge using a JA-17 rotor. The supernatant was applied to a HiTrap chelating resin (Amersham Biosciences) charged with Ni2+ ions. The column was washed with 50 mm imidazole in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and the protein was eluted using 200 mm imidazole in the same buffer. The purity of the protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE. The final yield for 15N-labeled protein was 30 mg/liter and for 13C/15N-labeled protein was 20 mg/liter. The purity of the protein was >95%. Characterization of Recombinant PPIL1—When recombinant PPIL1 was purified and concentrated to 50 mg/ml, only a few strong peaks could be observed in the 15N-1H HSQC due to severe aggregation. The peaks on HSQC were not well dispersed, and the number of the peaks did not increase significantly until the sample was diluted in the NMR buffer to the concentration of 10 mg/ml, estimated by BCA kits (Pierce). At that concentration, dynamic light scattering experiments indicated the protein was essentially monodisperse and stable with an estimated molecular mass of 20 kDa (data not shown). Therefore, the final concentration of PPIL1 sample applied in all NMR experiments was ∼10 mg/ml. The fractions of unlabeled protein were pooled and dialyzed against GST binding buffer. Construction, Expression of the N-terminal of Human SKIP Gene Fusions—The N-terminal 172 amino acids of the SKIP gene (SKIP172) and another three fragments (1–64, 59–129, and 126–172) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from human brain cDNA library and cloned into the multiple cloning sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences), resulting in a GST fusion gene. All GST fusion protein constructs were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). The protein production was induced at A600 0.6–0.8, using 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The culture was then kept shaking at 30 °C for 5–6 h. After being harvested and centrifuged, cells were disrupted by sonication and debris spun down at 15,000 rpm, 4 °C for 0.5 h in a Beckman centrifuge using a JA-17 rotor. The expression of target protein was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE analysis of supernatant fluid. All four GST fusion proteins were purified as shown in protocols. GST was cleaved from GST fusion protein by incubation with thrombin at 4 °C for 20 h and removed by glutathione-agarose beads. Cleaved peptide was further purified to remove thrombin. PPIase Activity Assay and Cyclosporin A Inhibition Assays—Purified recombinant PPIL1 was assayed for PPIase activity essentially as described by Fischer et al. (15Fischer G. Wittmannliebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar) with the suggested substrate solvent application as described by Kofron et al. (16Kofron J. Kuzmic P. Kishore V. Colonbonilla E. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6127-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The peptide substrate N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Sigma) was dissolved in trifluroethanol with 470 mm LiCl to give 25 mm stock solution. The experimental setup was as follows: PPIL1 was diluted into 50 mm HEPES, 86 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 (PPIase buffer) to give 1 μm stock. In a 1-ml cuvette, 6 μl of PPIL1 (10 nm final concentration) was added to 535 μlof PPIase buffer and incubated on ice for 1 h. Chymotrypsin (60 μl of 6 mg/ml) was added to the cuvette, followed by transfer of the cuvette to a thermostated cell holder by which the reaction temperature was maintained at 5 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of 1.2 μl of peptide substrate (50 μm) followed by rapid mixing. The absorbance at 395 nm due to the release of p-nitroanilide was recorded with data collected every 0.1 s over a 2-min period. A number of samples were tested using the above method. Cyclosporin A inhibition assays were carried out essentially as described above except that the samples were preincubated for a minimum of 60 min with varying amounts of cyclosporin A (Calbiochem). GST Pulldown Experiments in Vitro—For interaction of His-tagged PPIL1 with GST-SKIP-(1–172), GST-SKIP-(1–64), GST-SKIP-(59–129), and GST-SKIP-(126–172), recombinant GST and GST fusion protein were immobilized on 300-μl bed volume of glutathione-agarose beads. After washing with 3 ml of GST binding buffer, the beads were incubated with an excessive amount of His-tagged PPIL1, which had been preincubated with cyclosporin A for 1 h, in 500-μl total volume at 4 °C overnight on a rotator. The beads were washed by GST binding buffer supplemented with different concentrations of NaCl (2 ml of each buffer). Finally, the beads were eluted by GST binding buffer supplemented with 10 mm glutathione. The bound proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The bound PPIL1 were further affirmed by immunoblot using His tag antibody. Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—SPR experiments were carried out. nSKIP-(1–172) was coupled to a carboxymethyl-dextran CM5 sensor chip with an amine coupling kit. Binding was observed upon injection of different concentrations of PPIL1. The plateau values reached after completion of the association reactions were analyzed by a Langmuir binding isotherm. NMR Spectroscopy—The NMR sample of 15N/13C, 15N-PPIL1 was prepared and NMR experiments were recorded for assignments as described (17Xu C. Xu Y. Tang Y. Wu J. Shi Y. Huang Q. Zhang Q. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 31: 179-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). NOE distance restraints were generated using 15N-edited NOESY and 13C-edited NOESY spectra employing 130-ms mixing times. NMR data were processed by NMRPipe and NMRDraw software (18Delagio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar) and assigned with Sparky (19Goddard, T. D., and Kneller, D. G. Sparky 3, University of California, San FranciscoGoogle Scholar). The CSI (20Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar) program was used to obtain the backbone dihedral angles (ϕ and Ψ) in secondary structures on the basis of chemical shift information. The NOE-derived distance restraints were classified into four groups with the upper boundaries of 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 Ä and lower boundary of 1.80 Ä on the basis of NOE intensity measurements. Hydrogen bond restraints were defined from slow exchanging amide protons identified after exchange of the H2O buffer to D2O. Structure Calculations—Structure calculation for PPIL1 was performed on the basis of proton-proton NOE restraints and dihedral angle restraints (ϕ and Ψ) with a simulated annealing protocol using the CNS v1.1 program (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar). High temperature torsion angle dynamics was performed at 50,000 K for 15 ps (1,000 steps) followed by a 15-ps cooling phase. Initial structure calculations included only hydrogen bonds in defined secondary structures from CSI. In the following refinement calculation, only hydrogen bonds whose donors could be identified unambiguously were added. In the final calculations, an ensemble of 100 structures (no distance violations >0.3 Ä and no dihedral angle violations >5°) was generated from unambiguous NOEs previously determined. 20 models were selected on the basis of energetic criteria (low total energy, using the accept.inp routine) to form a representative ensemble of the calculated structures. NMR Backbone Relaxation Experiments—15N relaxation experiments were carried out at 295 K on a Bruker DMX500 NMR spectrometer. 15N relaxation measurements were carried out using the published methods (22Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). 15N T1 relaxation rates were measured with eight relaxation delays: 11, 62, 142, 243, 364, 525, 757, and 1150 ms. 15N T2 relaxation rates were measured with six relaxation delays: 17.6, 35.2, 52.8, 70.4, 105.6, and 140.8 ms. A recycle delay of 1 s was used for measurement of T1 and T2 relaxation rates. The spectra measuring 1H-15N NOE were acquired with a 2-s relaxation delay followed by a 3-s period of proton saturation. The spectra recorded in the absence of proton saturation employed a relaxation delay of 5 s. The exponential curve fitting and extract of T1 and T2 were processed by Sparky. The relaxation data R1/T1, R2/T2, and η were analyzed by Fast ModelFree v1.0. Chemical Shift Perturbation—For detecting the cyclosporin A and nSKIP binding sites on PPIL1, 1 mm 15N-labeled PPIL1 was used. After 1H, 15N-HSQC spectrum of free PPIL1 was recorded, and the sample was titrated with cyclosporin A in the method described by Weber et al. (23Weber C. Wider G. Freyberg B. Traber R. Braun W. Widmer H. Wüthrich K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6563-6574Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). After the 15N-1H HSQC of PPIL1-cyclosporin A was recorded, the sample was further titrated with 1 mm unlabeled SKIP until there was no change in the spectrum recorded. The final concentrations of both proteins at the end of the titration were ∼0.5 mm. All HSQC spectra for mapping the cyclosporin A and nSKIP binding interfaces on PPIL1 were performed on Bruker 600 MHz at 295 K. Exchange Experiments of PPIL1-nSKIP Complex in D2O—Freeze-dried 15N-PPIL1 mixed with nSKIP-(59–129) were dissolved in D2O. 15N-1H HSQC spectra were recorded to identify slow exchanging HNs of 15N-PPIL1 in the complex. Peptidyl Prolyl Cis-trans Isomerase Activity and Its Inhibition Activity by Cyclosporin A—PPIL1 clearly accelerates the rate of isomerization of the tetrapeptide substrate relative to the uncatalyzed thermal isomerization rate, and the catalysis is inhibited by addition of the cyclophilin binding drug cyclosporin A (in supplemental data). The enzyme reaction was found to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics with the velocity of the reaction (v) increasing with substrate concentration [S] (Fig. 1). First-order rate kinetics were observed, and a double reciprocal Line-weaver-Burke plot of 1/v against 1/[S] gave values of kcat 960 s–1, Km 230 μm, which corresponds to a value of kcat/Km of 4.2 × 106 m–1 s–1. These values are similar to the published values for human CypA, which has kcat 12700 s–1, Km 870 μm and kcat/Km 14.6 × 106 m–1 s–1 (16Kofron J. Kuzmic P. Kishore V. Colonbonilla E. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6127-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—The solution structure of the recombinant protein PPIL1 was determined by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The last 8 amino acids as artifact from vector were not included in structure calculations. Fig. 2 shows an ensemble of 20 NMR structures and a ribbon representation of the energy-minimized average structure of human PPIL1 by MOLMOL (24Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6477) Google Scholar). The coordinates of these 20 NMR structures have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (code 1XWN). Table 1 lists the structural statistics for the 20 deposited NMR structures. The root mean square deviation of the well defined secondary structure regions of the 20 structures to the average structure is 0.58 Ä for the backbone and 1.08 Ä for the heavy atoms. In contrast, the N-terminal residues (amino acids 1–11) are disordered because of few medium- and long-range NOEs.TABLE 1Summary of structure statisticsDistance restraints Intraresidue (i - j = 0)544 Sequential (|I - j| = 1)551 Medium range (2 < |i - j| <4)317 Long range (|i - j| >5)697 Hydrogen bonds96 Total2205Dihedral angle restraintsaThe Φ and Ψ angle restraints are generated from secondary structures by CSI. φ59 ψ59Mean r.m.s.d. from the experimental restraintsbR.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.

The residues in the disallowed regions were those in the terminal part or in the loops because of the paucity of inter-residual NOEs. Description of PPIL1 Structure—Fig. 2A shows the superimposition of the backbone (N, Cα, C′) of the best fit of 20 structures with the lowest energy. The overall architecture of PPIL1 is similar to that of known x-ray and NMR cyclophilin structures (26Ke H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 27Ottiger M. Zerbe O. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 64-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Mikol V. Kallen J. Walkinshaw M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5183-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with an anti-parallel eight-stranded β-barrel (13–18, 22–27, 55–57, 61–63, 97–104, 107–115, 127–132, 160–163) capped by two α-helices (33–45, 136–144). One short 310 helix (120–122) lies within the loop connecting strands β6 and β7 (Fig. 2B). After 1H-2H exchange experiments, we found most observable HNs exist in regular secondary structures. However, it is interesting that no backbone amide protons in helix α2 show slow exchange, which indicates helix α2 may not be in very rigid conformation or it may be exposed to the solvent. However, the NδH2 of Asn-140 exchanged slow as observed in the recorded HSQC in D2O, which probably H-bonded to O′ of Gly-137. In the solution structure of PPIL1, helix α2 was further stabilized by a network of hydrophobic interactions between well conserved amino acids such as Met-20, Ile-56, Ile-62, Val-114, Leu-116, Val-139, Val-142, and Val-145 (in supplemental data). Residue 55–57 in the β3 strand showed fast amide proton exchange in contrast to the residues in the other β strands, which have been described as “structure breath” in the solution structure of CypA (27Ottiger M. Zerbe O. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 64-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This could be explained as the potential ability of adjusting the interior side chains to fit the binding of its substrates or inhibitors for two enzyme activity sites (Arg-55, Ile-57) located on β3. The Structure Comparison of PPIL1 and Cyclophilin A—In Fig. 3A, PPIL1 is superimposed upon the structure of human cyclophilin A. The root mean square deviation for most defined secondary structures of Cα atoms of PPIL1 and CypA is 1.2 Ä. PPIL1 is 41.6% identical to CypA (at the amino acid level). Fig. 4 shows the sequence alignment of PPIL1 with several human cyclophilins. The PPIL1 structure is highly conserved when compared with the structure of human cyclophilin A, the best characterized member of the family (26Ke H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 27Ottiger M. Zerbe O. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 64-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The active sites of PPIL1 are also very similar to those found in human CypA; all 13 residues important in binding cyclosporin A are conserved. This is consistent with the facts that PPIL1 exhibits PPIase activity and the activity could be inhibited by cyclosporin A. By comparing the two structures, we found there were two highly conserved backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds located outside of regular secondary structures: Ala-32 NH-O′ Tyr-28 is in a helix-like turn, and Ser-51 NH-O′ Tyr-48 is a part of a β-turn (in supplemental data).FIGURE 4Sequence alignments.

The sequences were aligned by CLUSTAL_W with dashes introduced for maximum alignment. Conserved residues involved in binding inhibitors and substrates in Cyp A were labeled with stars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Despite the similarity in their overall structures, they are quite different at the C-terminal of helix α1 because of the loss of 3 amino acids in the loop linking α1 and β3 in PPIL1. In human cyclophilins, this feature is only present in high molecular mass cyclophilins Cyp-60 and Cyp-73 (29Galat A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A special turn occurs following α1 due to the loss of inserted amino acids, and the conserved β-turn is linked to α1 by two hydrogen bonds, Tyr-48 NH-O′ Leu-42 and Tyr-47 NH-O′ Leu-42 (in supplemental data). The special hydrogen network makes the C-terminal of helix α1 of PPIL1 significantly different from that of hCypA and close to the loop G65-Y78 in structure comparison. The loop following α1 (65–74) is in poorly defined conformation because of the lack of inter-residual NOEs. We also note that there is one amino acid insert in the loop preceding β8, which causes the displacement of residue 146–151 with respect to the corresponding residues in hCypA; this leads to a significantly altered conformation of this loop with respect to hCypA."

Clathrin-coated vesicle assembly and disassembly is regulated by some 30 adaptor and accessory proteins, most of which interact with clathrin heavy chain. Using the calcyon cytosolic domain as bait, we isolated clathrin light chain in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The interaction domain was mapped to the heavy chain binding domain and C-terminal regions of light chain. Further, the addition of the calcyon C terminus stimulated clathrin self-assembly in a dose-dependent fashion. Calcyon, which is a single transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in brain, localized to vesicular compartments within pre- and postsynaptic structures. There was a high degree of overlap in the distribution of LC and calcyon in neuronal dendrites, spines, and cell bodies. Co-immunoprecipitation studies further suggested an association of calcyon with the clathrin-mediated endocytic machinery. Compared with controls, HEK293 cells overexpressing calcyon exhibited significantly enhanced transferrin uptake but equivalent levels of recycling. Conversely, transferrin uptake was largely abolished in neocortical neurons obtained from mice homozygous for a calcyon null allele, whereas recycling proceeded at wild type levels.

The protein backbone of CCVs consists of clathrin triskelions assembled into a lattice structure. Each triskelion is composed of three heavy chains (HCs) and three light chains (LCs). The time and place of CCV assembly and breakdown are regulated by some 30 adaptor and accessory proteins (8Blondeau F. Ritter B. Allaire P.D. Wasiak S. Girard M. Hussain N.K. Angers A.

In contrast to HC, only four proteins aside from HC are known to interact with LC, including calmodulin (9Pley U.M. Hill B.L. Alibert C. Brodsky F.M. Parham P. J. Biol.

However, targeted deletion studies indicate that neuronal enriched isoforms of several adaptor and accessory proteins are essential for optimal synaptic transmission (4Dickman D.K. Horne J.A. Meinertzhagen I.A. Schwarz T.L. Cell. 2005; 123: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The enrichment of Hip1 and calmodulin in neurons raises the possibility that adaptor and accessory protein interactions with LC might likewise be crucial determinants of efficient CME in the central nervous system. Calcyon is a single transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and localized to membranous intracellular compartments within neuronal dendrites and dendritic spines. To learn more about the function of calcyon, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen with the calcyon cytosolic domain. Here we report that calcyon interacts with clathrin LC. Extensive functional characterization of the calcyon/LC interaction indicates that calcyon stimulates CCV assembly in vitro and CME in vivo. These data shed new light on the molecular mechanisms by which LC regulates clathrin assembly in neurons. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The predicted cytoplasmic domain of human calcyon (residues 123–217) was inserted in the yeast two-hybrid bait plasmid, pGBK, in-frame with the GAL4 binding domain, and used to screen a human brain cDNA library (∼3.9 × 104 independent clones) made in the prey vector, pACT2. Bait and prey plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain AH109, and transformants were screened on quadruple dropout medium lacking adenine, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine and containing X-α-gal (Clontech). GAL4 binding domain fusions to α2-laminin and caveolin-1 were used as unrelated baits to screen for false positives. DNA Constructs—Plasmids used in this study include pEGFP-C2 (Clontech), pCMV-Tag2C, or Tag3C (Stratagene) vectors expressing, respectively, N-terminal EGFP, FLAG, or Myc epitope-tagged cDNA of human calcyon and light chain a (GenBank™ accession number AF225903 and NM_007096, respectively). For pulldown assays, segments of the calcyon or clathrin light chain a (LCa) open reading frame were PCR-amplified using primers containing restriction enzyme sites for subcloning into the multiple cloning site of pET30a (Novagen) and pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. The DNA sequence of each construct was determined by an Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer (model 377XL) by the Molecular Core facility at the Medical College of Georgia. Clathrin Purification and Assembly Assays—CCVs were purified from 30 rat brains exactly as described in Ref. 15Maycox P.R. Link E. Reetz A. Morris S.A. Jahn R. J.

The clathrin coats were subsequently stripped from the vesicles, and purified clathrins were isolated by centrifugation in a 5–20% sucrose gradient exactly as described in Ref. 12Legendre-Guillemin V.

Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting with clathrin HC (1:2000; BD Biosciences) or LC (1:200; Covance) antibodies. Purified clathrin was dialyzed overnight in clathrin assembly buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) for self-assembly assays. Assembly assays were performed with purified clathrin and different concentrations of S-calcyon-C and S-calcyon-N fusion proteins as determined by the S-Tag rapid assay kit (Novagen) in a final volume of 90 μl of clathrin assembly buffer. Assembly was initiated at 4 °C by the addition of 10 ml of 1 m MES, pH 6.7. The mixture was incubated on ice for 45 min. and centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 6 min. Supernatants or pellets were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and HC was detected by staining gels with Coomassie Blue. Relative levels of clathrin assembly in wild type and Cal–/– brains were evaluated by differential centrifugation of forebrain homogenates as described (11Chen C.Y. Brodsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6109-6117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Acton S.L. Wong D.H. Parham P. Brodsky F.M. Jackson A.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, mid- and forebrain regions were dissected and Dounce-homogenized (15 strokes) in homogenization buffer D (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, protease inhibitors (complete mini, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science). Homogenates were passed twice through a 27.5-gauge needle and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 1 min to remove unbroken cells. Supernatants were then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min to pellet nuclei and plasma membranes (P1). Supernatants were recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman tabletop TL100 ultracentrifuge to separate cytosolic components, including unassembled clathrin (supernatant) from a vesicular fraction enriched in Golgi, endosomes, and clathrin assembled in CCVs (P2). The P1 and P2 pellets recovered were resuspended in a volume of buffer D equal to that of the supernatant fraction. Equal volumes of P1, P2, and supernatant fractions were loaded on a 10–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with clathrin HC (1:2000; BD Biosciences) or α-adaptin (1:1000; BD Biosciences) antibodies. Immunoblots were subjected to densitometric analysis using NIH Image J software (National Institutes of Health). The ratio of assembled to unassembled clathrin was compared between wild type and Cal–/– samples in a pairwise fashion using the P2 and supernatant (S) band intensities. “Assembly” levels (P2/S) detected in Cal–/– brain samples were normalized to those obtained for the wild type samples. Mammalian Cell and Primary Neuronal Cultures—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma). The Myc-calcyon HEK293 stable cell line was established by selection in culture medium containing 900 μg/ml G418 (Sigma) following transfection with plasmid DNA using Effectene (Qiagen) and maintained in culture medium containing 450 μg/ml G418. Neocortical neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 16 mice as described (17Redmond L. Kashani A.H. Ghosh A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 999-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine (20 μg/ml) and laminin-coated (1 μg/ml) dishes at a density of 2 × 106 cells/35-mm plate or 0.3 × 106 cells/well in a 24-well plate and maintained in glutamine-free basal medium Eagle, 1 mm glutamine, 1% N2, and 5% fetal calf serum at 37 °C. When necessary, neurons were transfected 48 h after plating with 2 μg of DNA/well (for a 24-well plate) by calcium phosphate co-precipitation. Pulldown and Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Equivalent amounts of glutathione S-transferase (GST) only or full-length and truncated GST-LCa fusion protein were prebound to glutathione resin (Amersham Biosciences) and blocked with binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Purified S-Tag calcyon fusion protein was subsequently incubated in binding buffer with the resin for 1 h at room temperature, and resins were washed five times each with a 10-fold excess of binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (ICN Biomed, Inc.). Membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20, 10% nonfat dry milk, and 5% normal goat serum prior to incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated S protein antibody (1:2000; Novagen). The immunoblots were washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 prior to detection of bound antibodies by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation studies in Myc-calcyon HEK293 cells were conducted with cells solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer. Cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (complete mini, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science). Homogenates were then centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 14,000 rpm, and the protein concentration of the supernatants was determined. Rabbit anti-Myc or anti-β-galactosidase antibodies were added to the supernatants, followed by incubation with protein A/G slurry for 3 h at 4°C. The slurry was washed four times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with α-adaptin (1:1000; BD Transduction Laboratories), γ-adaptin (1:1000; BD Transduction Labs), δ-adaptin SA4 (1:500; NICHD, National Institutes of Health, and the University of Iowa Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), FLAG M2 (1:1000; Sigma) mouse monoclonal antibodies, or an HRP-conjugated Myc rabbit antibody (1:1000; Roche Applied Science). Immunocytochemistry—Neurons were seeded on poly-l-lysine and laminin-coated glass coverslips. Cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After blocking in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk, 5% normal goat serum, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-Myc (1:2000; AbCam) and mouse EGFP antibodies (1:250; Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound primary antibodies were detected by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies: goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:2000) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes) (1:2000) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed five times in PBS after fixation and each antibody incubation step. Coverslips were mounted in Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes), and immunolabeling was observed under a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss Axiovert LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63 × 1.40 numerical aperture oil immersion objective lens, and documented using LSM510 software. Cells were excited using a 488-nm argon/krypton laser and detected with a 515–540-nm band pass filter. Alexa 594 was excited using a 543-nm helium/neon laser and detected with a 560-nm band pass filter. Images were collected at 1024 × 1024 resolution with a scan speed setting of 9 and pinhole adjustments of 0.8 and 0.9 μm, respectively, for the 488- and 594-nm channels. For transferrin (Tfn) co-localization studies, HEK293 cells were plated on polylysine-coated coverslips and transfected with Myc-calcyon. 16–24 h later, the cells were incubated on ice for 45 min with 25 μg/ml Alexa-488-conjugated Tfn. Unbound Tfn was removed by washing cells with ice-cold wash medium. The cells were shifted to 37 °C for 2–15 min. Uptake was stopped by placing the cells on ice and washing twice with acid PBS (30 mm glycine, pH 2.5) for 2 min at 4 °C to remove any surface-bound Tfn. Myc-calcyon was detected with rabbit anti-Myc antibodies (1:2000), followed by Alexa-594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Confocal images were taken using the Zeiss LSM-510 microscope. Tfn Endocytosis and Recycling Assays—For the HRP-Tfn uptake and recycling protocols (18Steiner P. Sarria J.C. Glauser L. Magnin S.

The next day, the cells were washed twice with warm Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in prewarmed Transport Medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). For HRP-Tfn endocytosis studies, the cells were shifted to 4 °C by placing on ice and washed once with ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were then incubated on ice with cold Transport Medium containing HRP-conjugated human Tfn (1 μg/ml) for 90 min to allow binding of Tfn to the cell surface. The samples were washed three times for 5 min each in ice-cold PBS to remove unbound ligand. Subsequently, endocytosis but not recycling was allowed to proceed by shifting the cells to 16 °C. Time points were taken at 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min by returning the plates to ice and washing in PBS containing 30 mm glycine, pH 2.5, followed by two washes in PBS prior to lysing the cells in PBS, 1% Triton X-100. For the HRP-Tfn recycling studies, the cells were preloaded with HRP-Tfn by incubating cells at 37 °C for 60 min in warm Transport Medium containing 1 μg/ml HRP-Tfn. The cells were then placed on ice and washed twice in PBS containing 30 mm glycine, pH 2.5, to remove surface-bound HRP-Tfn, followed by two additional washes in PBS for 5 min each. Recycling was stimulated by incubating the cells at 37 °C in prewarmed transport medium containing 100 nm unlabeled Tfn and 100 μm desferroxamine to block reuptake of recycled Tfn. Time points were taken at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min by shifting samples to ice and washing three times in PBS containing 30 mm glycine, pH 2.5, followed by two washes in PBS before lysing the cells. For quantitation of Tfn endocytosis in wild type and Cal–/– neurons, neocortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 16 mice as described above, and plated on polylysine- and laminin-coated 35-mm dishes at a density of 2 × 106 cells/dish. At 4 days in vitro, the neurons were washed and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in prewarmed Transport Medium (basal medium Eagle containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and buffered with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Neurons were then incubated on ice for 90 min with 5 μg/ml mouse HRP-Tfn in transport medium and shifted to 16 °C, a temperature permissive for endocytosis but not recycling. Time points were taken at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min by placing dishes on ice and washing six times with cold PBS. For determining rates of HRP-Tfn recycling, neurons at 4 days in vitro were washed and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in prewarmed Transport Medium and then preloaded with HRP-Tfn by incubating cells at 37 °C for 60 min with 5 μg/ml mouse HRP-Tfn in Transport Medium. After loading, cells were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold acid PBS, pH 2.5, followed by two washes with ice-cold PBS. Recycling was measured in warm transport medium containing 100 mm deferroxamine at 37 °C. Time points were taken at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min by placing the cells on ice and washing in PBS containing 30 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and PBS before lysing cells in PBS, 1% Triton X-100. In all of the endocytosis and recycling assays described above, HRP-Tfn values were determined for using the HRP tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma). OD values obtained with the TMB substrate at 450 nm after the addition of 2 m H2SO4, were normalized such that the intracellular HRP-Tfn/mg protein values were determined for each sample with standard curves both for protein and HRP-Tfn. Calcyon Gene Targeting—A c57Bl/6 ES cell line was electroporated with a 12.8-kb calcyon gene-targeting construct containing loxP sites inserted in introns 2 and 6, and a GK-neo cassette flanked by flp sites in intron 6. ES cell clones bearing the “floxed” calcyon allele (Calfl) were selected by PCR and Southern blotting, injected into Balb/c blastocysts, and implanted into ICR (white) females. Male chimeras were back-crossed to C57Bl/6 females, and black progeny were tested for germ line transmission by PCR of tail DNA. Mice homozygous for the targeted calcyon allele (Calcyonfl/fl) are viable and were crossed with CMVCRE mice (Jackson Laboratories). The CMVCRE transgene deleted both floxed calcyon alleles in Calfl/fl mice, generating a whole animal deletion of the calcyon gene (Cal–/–). Primers a (GGC CTA GCC TGG CCG TTC AAG), b (AGG CCG TGG GTG CAT TTC CTC), c (GAC CCA GCC CTT CTC CAC TTC), d (CAA TTT ACA GAA GGC CAA CCA C), and e (CTG TCC ATC TGC ACG AGA CT) were used for screening the targeted ES cell clones and for genotyping mice. Forward and reverse primers designated MusH164–185 (GAGACCAGGATGGGGCTGCAT) and muscal 3′ 949–928 (ACAGAGTCAGAGGTCCACCAGG), which anneal to the second and sixth exons, respectively, were used to detect expression of calcyon transcripts in mice brain samples by reverse transcription-PCR (20Dai R. Bergson C. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 311: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All wild type and transgenic mice were housed and bred in the animal facility at the Medical College of Georgia with protocols approved by the animal care and use committee and in accordance with the Public Health Service guidelines for animal husbandry and welfare. Electron Microscopy—Animals used for immunohistochemistry were housed and treated according to federal and institutional guidelines. Two adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were transcardially perfused under deep Nembutal anesthesia with a fixative containing 0.1 or 0.2% glutaraldehyde, respectively, 4% paraformaldehyde, and 0.2% picric acid in sodium phosphate buffer (PB; 0.1 m, pH 7.35). The brains were then postfixed for an additional 2 h with the same fixative. Coronal blocks from the PFC were cut on a Vibratome at 60 μm. Sections were washed in PB and placed in an ascending series of sucrose solutions, frozen, and then stored at –70 °C. After washing in PBS and blocking (3% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% glycine, and 0.1% lysine in PBS) for 40 min, sections of the PFC were incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-calcyon (1:5000) antibody (21Lezcano N. Mrzljak L. Eubanks S. Levenson R. Goldman-Rakic P. Bergson C. Science. 2000; 287: 1660-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) for 2 days at 4 °C followed by an incubation in a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) secondary antibody. Sections were then treated according to the avidin-biotin protocol using Vectastain ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, for 1 h) and tetramethylbenzidine as a chromogen. Briefly, sections, washed in PBS following the ABC step, were rinsed in phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) (PB6) and incubated in a solution containing 0.005% TMB (Sigma), 0.05% ammonium paratungstate, 0.004% NH4Cl in PB6. The reaction was developed according to the glucose oxidase method (22Itoh K. Konishi A. Nomura S. Mizuno N. Nakamura Y. Sugimoto T. Brain Res. 1979; 175: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Rinsing the sections in PB6 stopped the development of the TMB reaction. The reaction product was stabilized using 0.05% 3′3-diaminobenzodine (Sigma), 0.004% NH4Cl, 0.02% CoCl2 in PB6 with the aid of the glucose oxidase technique. Sections were then osmicated, dehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide, and then flat embedded in Durcupan ACM (Fluka Chemical Corp., Milwaukee, WI). Ultrathin sections cut from the PFC were poststained with lead citrate and examined on a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope. The percentage of labeled axons, spines, and dendrites was defined in each of the three different categories on electron micrographs taken from the neuropil of the PFC. Altogether, our analysis included 637 profiles. On each micrograph, TMB-labeled profiles were identified and classified by ultrastructural criteria (23Peters A.L. Palay S.L. Webster H. The Fine Structure of the Nervous System: Neurons and Their Supporting Cells. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 70Google Scholar). Profiles were identified as spines based on size (0.3–1.5 μm in diameter), presence of spine apparatus, absence of mitochondria or microtubules, and, in some cases, the presence of asymmetric synaptic contacts. Dendrites were identified by their larger size (0.5 μmor greater in diameter) and the presence of microtubules, mitochondria, and, in some cases, synaptic contacts. Axon terminals were characterized by the presence of numerous vesicles, mitochondria, and occasionally a presynaptic specialization. Preterminal, unmyelinated axons were identified by their small size (0.1–0.3 μm in diameter), regular round shape, and occasional presence of synaptic vesicles or neurofilaments. Calcyon Interacts with the HC Binding Domain and C-terminal Segment of LC—A yeast two-hybrid screen of an adult human brain cDNA library using human calcyon C-terminal residues 123–217 as bait yielded an interacting clone encoding the neuronal isoform of LCa (24Brodsky F.M. Science. 1988; 242: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 25Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Growth of colonies containing the calcyon bait and the LCa activation domain clone could be detected within 2 days of plating on quadruple dropout selective medium. In contrast, colonies containing the LCa construct and either empty bait vector or an unrelated bait construct were not detectable 5 days after plating, suggesting that the interaction between calcyon and LCa is specific and sufficient for growth on quadruple dropout medium. Clathrin LCs are encoded by two ubiquitously expressed genes, LCa and LCb, that share ∼60% sequence identity at the amino acid level but differ slightly in length (10Brodsky F.M. Hill B.L. Acton S.L. Nathke I. Wong D.H. Ponnambalam S. Parham P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 208-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The neural isoform of LCa is composed of a series of domains, including the “conserved sequence,” Hsc70-binding site, Ca2+-binding domain, HC binding site, neuron-specific insert, and a C-terminal segment that includes the calmodulin binding site (Fig. 1A) (25Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). We localized the calcyon interaction domain with a panel of GST-LCa fusion proteins (Fig. 1, B–D). For example, immobilized GST fusion protein including full-length LCa (GST-LCa1–248) quantitatively precipitated the S-calcyon-C, an S-tagged bacterial fusion protein, including the C terminus (residues 114–217) of human calcyon. In contrast, similar assays with equivalent amounts of GST alone yielded no recovery of the S-tagged protein (Fig. 1, B and E). Further experiments revealed that truncating LCa from the C terminus negatively impacted the yield of S-calcyon-C pulled down. The reduced effectiveness correlated with the extent of deletion, such that the combined deletion of the C-terminal domain, neuron-specific se"
https://openalex.org/W2019470656,"In mammalian mitochondria the translational machinery is of dual origin with tRNAs encoded by a simplified and rapidly evolving mitochondrial (mt) genome and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) coded by the nuclear genome, and imported. Mt-tRNAs are atypical with biased sequences, size variations in loops and stems, and absence of residues forming classical tertiary interactions, whereas synthetases appear typical. This raises questions about identity elements in mt-tRNAs and adaptation of their cognate mt-aaRSs. We have explored here the human mt-aspartate system in which a prokaryotic-type AspRS, highly similar to the Escherichia coli enzyme, recognizes a bizarre tRNAAsp. Analysis of human mt-tRNAAsp transcripts confirms the identity role of the GUC anticodon as in other aspartylation systems but reveals the non-involvement of position 73. This position is otherwise known as the site of a universally conserved major aspartate identity element, G73, also known as a primordial identity signal. In mt-tRNAAsp, position 73 can be occupied by any of the four nucleotides without affecting aspartylation. Sequence alignments of various AspRSs allowed placing Gly-269 at a position occupied by Asp-220, the residue contacting G73 in the crystallographic structure of E. coli AspRS-tRNAAsp complex. Replacing this glycine by an aspartate renders human mt-AspRS more discriminative to G73. Restriction in the aspartylation identity set, driven by a rapid mutagenic rate of the mt-genome, suggests a reverse evolution of the mt-tRNAAsp identity elements in regard to its bacterial ancestor. In mammalian mitochondria the translational machinery is of dual origin with tRNAs encoded by a simplified and rapidly evolving mitochondrial (mt) genome and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) coded by the nuclear genome, and imported. Mt-tRNAs are atypical with biased sequences, size variations in loops and stems, and absence of residues forming classical tertiary interactions, whereas synthetases appear typical.

We have explored here the human mt-aspartate system in which a prokaryotic-type AspRS, highly similar to the Escherichia coli enzyme, recognizes a bizarre tRNAAsp. Analysis of human mt-tRNAAsp transcripts confirms the identity role of the GUC anticodon as in other aspartylation systems but reveals the non-involvement of position 73. This position is otherwise known as the site of a universally conserved major aspartate identity element, G73, also known as a primordial identity signal. In mt-tRNAAsp, position 73 can be occupied by any of the four nucleotides without affecting aspartylation. Sequence alignments of various AspRSs allowed placing Gly-269 at a position occupied by Asp-220, the residue contacting G73 in the crystallographic structure of E. coli AspRS-tRNAAsp complex. Replacing this glycine by an aspartate renders human mt-AspRS more discriminative to G73. Restriction in the aspartylation identity set, driven by a rapid mutagenic rate of the mt-genome, suggests a reverse evolution of the mt-tRNAAsp identity elements in regard to its bacterial ancestor. Specific aminoacylation of transfer RNAs (tRNA) by their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) 4The abbreviations used are: aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; mt, mitochondrial; WT, wild type. is a key step in translation of genetic information. Rules governing recognition between partner macromolecules have been well studied for a large number of prokaryotic and cytosolic eukaryotic systems (1Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 2Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Biopolymers. 1999; 52: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 3Giegé R. Frugier M. Lapointe J. Brakier-Gringas L. Translation Mechanisms. Landes Sciences, Georgetown, TX2003: 1-24Google Scholar). They rely on identity nucleotides, mainly located at both extremities of the tRNA L-shape, that contact specific amino acids in the aaRS structure. Composed of major and minor elements, identity sets are usually conserved during evolution, as is the architecture of tRNA (1Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 3Giegé R. Frugier M. Lapointe J. Brakier-Gringas L. Translation Mechanisms. Landes Sciences, Georgetown, TX2003: 1-24Google Scholar). However, they can be completed by idiosyncratic subtleties such as cryptic (4Saks M.E. Sampson J.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or permissive (5Frugier M. Helm M. Felden B. Giegé R. Florentz C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11605-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) elements and structural features including flexibility and the overall tRNA scaffold (6Giegé R.

Biol. 2004; 11: 1134-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Despite that, identity sets remain mainly unknown for organellar tRNAs, in particular for mammalian mitochondrial (mt)-tRNAs, a group of atypical macromolecules. Mammalian mt-tRNAs differ from classical tRNAs at the structural level and in regard to potential identity sets (8Helm M. Brulé H. Friede D. Giegé R. Pütz J. Florentz C. RNA. 2000; 6: 1356-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Coded by the mt genome, they display non-canonical features and significantly degenerated sequences (8Helm M. Brulé H. Friede D. Giegé R. Pütz J. Florentz C. RNA. 2000; 6: 1356-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 9Florentz C. Sohm B. Tryoen-Tóth P. Pütz J. Sissler M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1356-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A majority (14 of 22) possess a biased nucleotide composition, unusual sizes of D- and/or T-loops, and miss otherwise conserved residues required for three-dimensional folding. Identity elements are only sparsely known. According to the endosymbiotic hypothesis on the origin of mitochondria (10Margulis L. Symbiosis in Cell Evolution. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco1981Google Scholar) and the ability of mt-aaRSs to aminoacylate Escherichia coli tRNAs (11Kumazawa Y. Himeno H. Miura K.-I. Watanabe K. J. Biochem. 1991; 109: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), identity elements of E. coli tRNAs were searched in the corresponding mammalian mt-tRNA sequences, and some have indeed been found (8Helm M. Brulé H. Friede D. Giegé R. Pütz J. Florentz C. RNA. 2000; 6: 1356-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Conversely for the large sequence and structural degeneracy of mammalian mt-tRNAs, corresponding mt-aaRSs seem not to depart from the already known synthetases (Refs. 12Bonnefond L. Fender A. Rudinger-Thirion J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Sissler M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4805-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Sissler M. Pütz J. Fasiolo F. Florentz C. Ibba M. Francklyn C. Cusack S. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Biosciences, Georgetown, TX2005: 271-284Google Scholar and references therein). They are nuclear encoded and possess an mt-targeting signal. Recent completion of the full set of human (Hs) mt-aaRS genes confirms the view that, except for GlyRS 5aaRS stands for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase with aa for amino acid. For individual aaRS, aa is given in the three-letter code, e.g. AspRS for aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. and LysRS, mt and cytosolic aaRSs are coded by two different sets of genes (12Bonnefond L. Fender A. Rudinger-Thirion J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Sissler M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4805-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The human synthetases of mt location have no apparent structural peculiarities compared with related synthetases (except PheRS, which is a monomer instead of an α2β2 tetramer). They belong to the expected aaRS classes because they possess either of the two signatures in the catalytic domain (Rossmann-fold for class I; semiconserved motifs 1, 2, and 3 for class II) (14Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 15Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Härtlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature. 1990; 347: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In a larger frame, mt-aaRSs from various organisms present, with a few exceptions, typical and expected features of synthetases (13Sissler M. Pütz J. Fasiolo F. Florentz C. Ibba M. Francklyn C. Cusack S. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Biosciences, Georgetown, TX2005: 271-284Google Scholar, 16Small I.D. Wintz H. Akashi K. Mireau H. Plant Mol.

A. 2005; 102: 16484-16489Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Apposition of “bizarre” tRNAs versus standard aaRSs raises a question as to the rules governing recognition and specific aminoacylation. To shed light on this question, we have explored the Hs mt aspartylation system. This choice is guided by the extensive knowledge of aspartylation identity elements in various organisms including E. coli (18Hasegawa T. Himeno H. Ishikura H. Shimizu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1989; 163: 1534-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Nameki N. Tamura K. Himeno H. Asahara H. Hasegawa T. Shimuzu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992; 189: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (20Pütz J. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Giegé R. Science. 1991; 252: 1696-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 21Frugier M. Söll D. Giegé R. Florentz C.

Giegé R. Frugier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9683-9690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and Thermus thermophilus (24Becker H.D. Giegé R. Kern D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7447-7458Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Further, Hs mt-AspRS was recently cloned and overexpressed and is one of the few mt synthetases with enough solubility to be analyzed biochemically (12Bonnefond L. Fender A. Rudinger-Thirion J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Sissler M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4805-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Hs mt-tRNAAsp presents characteristic mammalian mt-tRNA features. When compared with “classical” tRNAs (Fig. 1, A and B), it has shorter D- and T-loops and a biased nucleotide composition with 29 A, 7 G, 24 U, 11 C leading to a high content of weak base pairs (16 A-U and G-U pairs versus only 5 G-C pairs). Typical signals important for tertiary interactions are missing, such as residues G18 and G19 in the D-loop and the UUC sequence (the precursor of TΨC) in the T-loop involved in long-range interactions. Altogether, only 5 of the 9 expected tertiary interactions involved in an L-shaped three-dimensional folding (25Giegé R. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 129-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) could be predicted. These structural features suggest a much more flexible structure for mt-tRNAAsp than for classical tRNAs (8Helm M. Brulé H. Friede D. Giegé R. Pütz J. Florentz C. RNA. 2000; 6: 1356-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of classical (i.e. non-mt) tRNAAsp molecules highlighted conserved nucleotides that have proven to be major aspartate identity elements in all systems tested so far (reviewed in Refs. 26Giegé R. Florentz C. Kern D. Gangloff J. Eriani G. Moras D. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Giegé R. Rees B. Ibba M. Francklyn C. Cusack S. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005: 210-226Google Scholar). They correspond to the discriminator residue G73 and the anticodon triplet G34-U35-C36. Aspartate identity is further defined by additional elements of minor strength such as residue C38 and base pair G10-U/C25, and further in E. coli by the species-specific G2-C71 pair (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, Hs mt-tRNAAsp presents the potential major elements within the anticodon triplet, but not the discriminator base G73. Further, within the minor elements, only the pair G10-C25 is present whereas C38, as well as the minor E. coli signal G2-C71, is missing. Analysis of the consensus of 136 mammalian mt-tRNAAsp sequences (Fig. 1C) confirms a strong conservation (albeit not total) of the anticodon triplet nucleotides and the absence of nucleotide conservation at position 73 and of the minor elements. It highlights base pairs R2-U71 (R for purine) and A49-U65 as strongly conserved, designating them as potential identity elements. This analysis leads to the hypothesis that Hs mt-tRNAAsp presents either a reduced or an alternate identity set compared with the so far known other aspartate tRNAs. In contrast, cognate nuclear-encoded Hs mt-AspRS, recently characterized (12Bonnefond L. Fender A. Rudinger-Thirion J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Sissler M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4805-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), displays standard features and resembles known AspRSs. Markedly, it is a class II synthetase, has the typical bacterial insertion and C-terminal extension, and shares >40% of strictly identical residues with E. coli AspRS. We have shown here that Hs mt-tRNAAsp conserves GUC aspartate anticodon as identity elements but not the discriminator position 73. This indicates simplified aspartate identity rules in the Hs mt system. Sequence comparison shows a local structural deviation in the mt enzyme next to the discriminator position in the tRNA. Accordingly, an mt-AspRS could be engineered to partially restore its discriminating capacity for G73. This is in favor of a local and focused adaptation of the slowly evolving nuclear-encoded enzyme, allowing for the unimportance of residue 73 rather than for recognition of an alternative nucleotide at this position. These data will be discussed in light of molecular evolution of tRNA aminoacylation systems in the peculiar mt context. Materials—Synthetic genes of yeast (28Perret V. Garcia A. Puglisi J.D.

Science. 1991; 252: 1696-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and Hs mt-tRNAAsp (12Bonnefond L. Fender A. Rudinger-Thirion J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Sissler M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4805-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) were previously cloned. The T. thermophilus tRNAAsp transcript and E. coli AspRS were gifts from H. Becker and G. Eriani. Hs mt-tRNATyr transcripts were gifts from L. Bonnefond and J. Rudinger-Thirion. Hs mt-AspRS was cloned (plasmid pQE70-mt-AspRS), overexpressed, and purified as described (12Bonnefond L. Fender A. Rudinger-Thirion J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Sissler M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4805-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). T7 RNA polymerase was purified as described (24Becker H.D. Giegé R. Kern D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7447-7458Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were from Sigma Genosys, restriction enzymes (BamHI, HindIII, and BstNI) from New England Biolabs, T4 DNA ligase from Qbiogen, and l-[3H]aspartic acid (1.37 TBq/mmol) from Amersham Biosciences. tRNA Gene Mutagenesis and in Vitro Transcription—Hs mt-tRNAAsp variant genes were obtained by hybridization of 9 overlapping oligonucleotides, ligation between BamHI and HindIII sites of plasmid pTFMa (28Perret V. Garcia A. Puglisi J.D. Grosjean H. Ebel J.-P. Florentz C. Giegé R. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and transformation into TG1 cells. Mutant genes were obtained with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). These genes contain a hammerhead ribozyme (29Fechter P. Rudinger J. Giegé R. Théobald-Dietrich A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and tRNA sequences downstream the T7 polymerase promoter. A BstNI site coincidental with the 3′-end of the tRNA sequences allows synthesis of tRNAs ending with the expected CCA sequence. Transcription was as described (29Fechter P. Rudinger J. Giegé R. Théobald-Dietrich A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). mt-AspRS Mutagenesis and Expression—Plasmid pQE70-mt-AspRS was converted into pQE70-mt-AspRS/G269D using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and transformation of E. coli TOP10 strain. Mt-AspRS/G269D was expressed and purified on nickel affinity column (12Bonnefond L. Fender A. Rudinger-Thirion J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Sissler M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4805-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined from A280 using an extinction coefficient calculated with ProtParam from Expasy tools (ε = 43540 M–1·cm–1). Aminoacylation—Assays were performed as described (12Bonnefond L. Fender A. Rudinger-Thirion J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Sissler M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4805-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) except that they were conducted at 15 instead of 25 °C. Buffer conditions were 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATP, 0.2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 1 mm spermine, 32 μm [3H]aspartic acid (208 GBq/mmol), and adequate amounts of transcripts and aaRS. Assays were performed in 50-μl samples. Transcripts were renatured (60 °C for 90 s in water and slow cooling down to room temperature) before aminoacylation was performed at 15 °C. Maximal charging levels (plateaus) were determined for 400 nm transcript and 680 nm synthetase (wild-type (WT) or G269D mutant AspRS). Under such conditions, plateaus determine the percentage of active molecules in each tRNA preparation (30Bonnet J. Ebel J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 31: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Plateau values varying between 40 and 80% were obtained and taken into account for Km calculations. Synthetase activity was measured under excess substrate (8 μm) and 50 nm enzyme. Kinetic parameters kcat and Km were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots obtained under adequate ranges of tRNA (40 nm-1 μm) and AspRS (50–200 nm). For tRNAAsp mutant C36U, kcat/Km was determined according to Ref. 31Schulman L.H. Pelka H. Science. 1988; 242: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar. Experiments were at least tripled on separate preparations of transcripts. Values varied up to 40%. Preliminary Considerations—Aspartate identity elements have been searched for by evaluation of the aspartylation properties of in vitro transcribed Hs mt-tRNAs. This strategy is of particular interest for human mt-tRNAs because it allows preparation of sufficient amounts of RNA either of WT or mutated sequence and has already been successfully applied for several human mt-tRNAs despite a number of drawbacks (reviewed in Ref. 32Levinger L. Mörl M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5430-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Post-transcriptional modifications, absent in transcripts, may stabilize tRNA structure and/or provide a recognition element for interacting partners such as aaRSs. However, in the case of Hs mt-tRNAAsp we believe that the absence of such modifications does not significantly affect aminoacylation properties. Comparative structure probing of native tRNA (extracted in nano-quantities from HeLa cells) and transcripts leads to similar results (see below and supplemental data). Further, post-transcriptional modifications have never been reported so far as a positive aspartate determinant (for instance, the yeast WT tRNAAsp transcript is only 10-fold less efficiently aspartylated than native tRNA) (33Perret V. Garcia A. Grosjean H. Ebel J.-P. Florentz C. Giegé R. Nature. 1990; 344: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and this conclusion likely holds true in the Hs mt system. Indeed, Hs WT-tRNAAsp transcript is aspartylated with only a 11.5-fold lower efficiency than native E. coli tRNAAsp (12Bonnefond L. Fender A. Rudinger-Thirion J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Sissler M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4805-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, as reported in several instances, handling of Hs mt-tRNAs remains tricky, especially those tRNAs with a high A, U, and C content (“light tRNAs”) that are thermodynamically weak (as is the case for tRNAAsp) (9Florentz C. Sohm B. Tryoen-Tóth P. Pütz J. Sissler M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1356-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, aminoacylation assays have to be performed at low temperatures, a compromise for optimal enzymatic activity and tRNA stability (34Sohm B. Frugier M. Brulé H. Olszak K. Przykorska A. Florentz C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 995-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 35Sissler M. Helm M. Frugier M. Giegé R. Florentz C. RNA. 2004; 10: 841-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the present study, aminoacylation assays were performed at 15 °C to allow for reproducible results. Lowering assay temperature from 25 to 15 °C reduces the catalytic efficiency for aspartylation only ∼3-fold (kcat/Km of 77 10–3 s–1·μm–1 at 25 °C (Ref. 12Bonnefond L. Fender A. Rudinger-Thirion J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Sissler M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4805-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and 27 10–3 s–1·μm–1 at 15 °C; see Table 1). These efficiencies remain in a range similar to those observed for other Hs mt aminoacylation systems (12Bonnefond L. Fender A. Rudinger-Thirion J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Sissler M.

A first series of variants included single point mutations at nucleotide positions that correspond to major aspartate identity determinants in yeast, E. coli, and T. thermophilus, i.e. positions 34, 35, 36, and 73. Mutations at positions 35 and 36 strongly impair aminoacylation (Fig. 2A) and lead at least to a loss of catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of 215-fold (Table 1). Mutations at position 34 moderately decrease aspartylation (Fig. 2A) with a loss in efficiency of 10- to 20-fold. In regard to the discriminator position 73, replacement of A73 by G73, C73, or U73 keeps significant aspartylation activities with rates close to those of WT (Fig. 2B) and kinetic parameters for the three variants very similar to those of WT (Table 1). Thus, although the anticodon nucleotides contribute to identity, position 73 is no longer an identity element in the human mitochondrial system. Next, the contribution of nucleotides known as minor aspartate identity elements in bacterial or eukaryal systems was investigated. Replacement of A38 by G38 decreases aminoacylation whereas replacement by C38 or U38 increases it (Fig. 2C). This surprising stimulation (not observed for other aspartate tRNAs) could reveal either insertion of a positive identity element, suggesting that natural mt-tRNA sequence with A38 is not optimal for its cognate synthetase, or that a pyrimidine at position 38 leads to structural rearrangements within the anticodon domain favoring synthetase recognition. This hypothesis was tested by comparing solution structures of both WT mt-tRNAAsp and variant C38. The two transcripts share essentially similar reactivities against enzymatic probes, indicative of a common global secondary structure. They differ, however, from native mt-tRNAAsp at their D-domains (detailed data to be published elsewhere). Reactivity of nucleotides within the anticodon loop of the variants (supplemental Fig. S1) differs at subtle levels, those of variant C38 being midway between those in the post-transcriptionally modified native tRNA and those in the “naked” WT transcript. This suggests that the increased aminoacylation capacity of variant C38 is in part linked to a structural rearrangement of its anticodon loop. C38 may mimic the structural role of post-transcriptional modifications present in native tRNA. Because of the importance of the anticodon loop in mt-tRNAAsp aminoacylation, the contribution of position 37 to aspartylation was also tested, but none of the nucleotides introduced in place of A37 had an effect (results not shown). Thus, A37 is not an identity element. Base pair G2-C71 is a minor identity element in E. coli tRNAAsp (19Nameki N. Tamura K. Himeno H. Asahara H. Hasegawa T. Shimuzu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992; 189: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In Hs mt-tRNAAsp, as in all other mammalian mt-tRNAAsp, the sequence is conserved as R2-U71 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that it could be an important signal for mt-AspRS. Another strictly conserved signal is A49-U65 in the T-stem. Both base pairs were individually replaced by G-C or U-A (Fig. 2D). Aminoacylation properties of the four new variants are close to those of WT transcript, showing that corresponding WT nucleotides have no major contribution to mt aspartate identity. An intriguing characteristic of mammalian mt-tRNAs is their unusual D- and T-loop ensembles with no classical size or obvious signals for tertiary interactions. The importance of these typical structural features was thus tested on aspartylation. Both loops of Hs mt-tRNAAsp were replaced at once by those of Schizosaccharomyces pombe cytosolic tRNAAsp (Fig. 2E), where classical tertiary interactions can take place. Aspartylation of this variant is not affected (Fig. 2E). In summary, aspartylation of Hs mt-tRNAAsp is restricted to the anticodon residues (U35 and C36 as strongest elements, G34 as moderate contributor). The discriminator residue 73 does not contribute. The primordial (22Frugier M. Florentz C. Giegé R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2218-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and essential identity element G73 in bacterial and eukaryal aspartylation systems (26Giegé R. Florentz C. Kern D. Gangloff J. Eriani G. Moras D. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) is present in the three domains of life including organelles, with the sole exception of mitochondria from mammals (41Sprinzl M. Vassilenko K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D139-D140Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). No additional identity element has been found (within the limit of the obvious candidates explored herein). It is of particular interest to notice that the mt aspartate identity set departs not only in a general manner from other aspartylation systems but also more specifically from the E. coli system despite the high sequence similarity of E. coli and Hs mt-AspRSs. Base pair 2–71 is not important and, within the anticodon triplet, the strength of the determinants is distinct: G34 = U35 > C36 in E. coli and G34 ≪ U35 = C36 in Hs mitochondria. Finally, the mt enzyme is not sensitive to structural features in the corner of the tRNA three-dimensional structure because it aminoacylates as well a Hs mt-tRNAAsp transcript transplanted with canonical D- and T-loops like E. coli tRNAAsp of classical structure (12Bonnefond L. Fender A. Rudinger-Thirion J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Sissler M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4805-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Non-conservation of major identity elements in aminoacylation systems of a same specificity has been reported previously, especially non-conservation of the discriminator base in different organisms (3Giegé R. Frugier M. Lapointe J. Brakier-Gringas L. Translation Mechanisms. Landes Sciences, Georgetown, TX2003: 1-24Google Scholar). For example, specific prolylation requires A73 and C1-G72 in E. coli whereas these positions are not involved in proline identity in Hs cytosol (42Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K.

TAFIa is a thermolabile enzyme, inactivated through a conformational change. The objective of the current study was to generate a stable variant of human TAFIa. Using a site-directed as well as a random mutagenesis approach to generate a library of TAFI mutants, we identified two mutations that increase TAFIa stability, i.e. a Ser305 to Cys and a Thr329 to Ile mutation, respectively. Combining these mutations in TAFI-Ala147-Ile325, the most stable isoform of TAFIa (half-life of 9.4 ± 0.4 min), revealed a TAFIa half-life of 70 ± 3.1 min (i.e. an 11-fold increase versus 6.3 ± 0.3 min for TAFIa-Ala147-Thr325, the most frequently occurring isoform of TAFI in humans) at 37 °C. Moreover, clot lysis (induced by tissue plasminogen activator) experiments in which TAFI-Ala147-Cys305-Ile325-Ile329 was added to TAFI-depleted plasma revealed a 50% clot lysis time of 313 ± 77 min (i.e. a 3.0-fold increase versus 117 ± 10 min for TAFI-Ala147-Thr325). The availability of a more stable TAFIa variant will facilitate the search for inhibitors and allow further structural analysis to elucidate the mechanisms of the instability of TAFIa.

The zymogen thrombin activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), 2The abbreviations used are: TAFI, thrombin activable fibrinolysis inhibitor; T/TM, thrombin/thrombomodulin complex; pCPB, pancreatic carboxypeptidase B; PTCI, potato tuber carboxypeptidase inhibitor; PPACK, H-d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone; Hip-Arg, hippuryl-l-arginine. also known as procarboxypeptidase U (proCPU), can be activated by the thrombin/thrombomodulin complex (T/TM) or by plasmin into its active form (i.e. TAFIa or CPU). TAFIa exerts an antifibrinolytic effect by removing C-terminal lysines from partially degraded fibrin, thereby removing the fibrin cofactor function for tissue plasminogen activator-mediated plasminogen activation (1Hendriks D. Scharpe S. van-Sande M. Lommaert M.P. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1989; 27: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar, 2Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol.

Even though TAFIa is a powerful antifibrinolytic enzyme, there are no known physiologic inhibitors of TAFIa (5Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Instead, TAFIa is regulated by its intrinsic temperature-dependent instability (i.e. half-life between 5 and 15 min at 37 °C) (6Schneider M. Boffa M.B. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M.

Subsequent to this conformational change, TAFIa can be cleaved at Arg302 by thrombin and plasmin and at Lys327 or Arg330 by plasmin (10Marx P.F. Dawson P.E. Bouma B.N. Meijers J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6688-6696Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The antifibrinolytic effect of TAFIa is half-maximal at 1 nm, whereas the plasma concentration of total TAFI ranges between 75 and 250 nm (11Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stromqvist M. Schatteman K. Leurs J. Verkerk R. Andersson J.O. Johansson T. Scharpe S. Hendriks D. Thromb.

Haemost. 1998; 80: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Therefore, only a small fraction of TAFI in plasma needs to be activated to exert the maximal antifibrinolytic effect (observed at 20 nm TAFIa). Thus, increasing the concentration (above 20 nm TAFIa) does not result in an increased antifibrinolytic effect. Consequently, the maximal antifibrinolytic effect can only be further increased by increasing the TAFIa stability (6Schneider M. Boffa M.B. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). TAFIa and pancreatic carboxypeptidase B (pCPB) are highly homologous members of the carboxypeptidase A family. In contrast to TAFIa, pCPB is a stable enzyme. Although TAFIa and pCPB share 48% sequence identity, the sequence identity in the 300–330 amino acid region is only 13%. Two polymorphisms in the TAFI coding region, resulting in two amino acid variations (i.e. A147T and T325I), have been reported (14Zhao L. Morser J. Bajzar L. Nesheim M. Nagashima M. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Brouwers G.J. Vos H.L. Leebeek F.W. Bulk S. Schneider M. Boffa M. Koschinsky M. van-Tilburg N.H. Nesheim M.E. Bertina R.M. Gomez-Garcia E.B. Blood. 2001; 98: 1992-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The allele frequencies of the corresponding four single nucleotide polymorphisms are 0.72, 0.28, 0.64, and 0.36 for the Ala147-, Thr147-, Thr325-, and Ile325-encoding alleles, respectively (15Brouwers G.J. Vos H.L. Leebeek F.W. Bulk S. Schneider M. Boffa M. Koschinsky M. van-Tilburg N.H. Nesheim M.E. Bertina R.M. Gomez-Garcia E.B. Blood. 2001; 98: 1992-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, Ile at position 325 extends the half-life of TAFIa from 8 to 15 min regardless of the residue at position 147 (6Schneider M. Boffa M.B. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The increased stability of the Ile325 variants is associated with a 1.6-fold higher antifibrinolytic effect, indicating that the thermal (in)stability is an important determinant for the antifibrinolytic potential of TAFIa. To date, this T325I polymorphism is the only known amino acid variation that increases the TAFIa half-life. Attempts have been undertaken to increase the stability of TAFIa by mutagenesis (7Boffa M.B. Bell R. Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12868-12878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or by construction of chimeric variants (16Marx P.F. Havik S.R. Marquart J.A. Bouma B.N. Meijers J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6620-6628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although some variants exhibit an increased TAFIa stability (16Marx P.F. Havik S.R.

Chem. 2004; 279: 6620-6628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), this effect was never associated with an increased antifibrinolytic effect. The objective of the current study was to create a more stable TAFIa variant that retains its antifibrinolytic potential. Materials—Recombinant TAFI isoforms (Ala147-Thr325 (TAFI-AT), Ala147-Ile325 (TAFI-AI)) and monoclonal antibodies raised against TAFI purified from plasma were generated as described before (17Gils A. Alessi M.C. Brouwers E. Peeters M. Marx P. Leurs J. Bouma B. Hendriks D. Juhan-Vague I. Declerck P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1122-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis and sequencing were purchased from Sigma-Genosys. dNTP mix was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Mutagenesis was performed using the GeneMorph™ II EZClone domain mutagenesis kit or the QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (both from Stratagene). PfuTurbo™ polymerase was obtained from Stratagene. PCR reactions were carried out with the Mastercycler® Gradient from Eppendorf. Plasmid DNA purification was performed with the Nucleobond™ AX500 kit (Machery-Nagel) or the FastPlasmid™ mini kit (Eppendorf). DNA was sequenced with the Automated Laser Fluorescent ALF® apparatus according to the protocol for the ALFexpress™ Autoread Sequencing kit (both from Amersham Biosciences). Human thrombin, rabbit thrombomodulin, and H-d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) were obtained from Sigma, American Diagnostica, and Biomol Research Labs, respectively.

Lipofectamine™ 2000 and Opti-MEM 1 medium containing glutamax were purchased from Invitrogen. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was purchased from Bio-Rad. Citrated plasma of 23 healthy individuals was pooled for clot lysis experiments. TAFI-depleted plasma was obtained by adsorption on monoclonal antibodies T4E3, raised against human plasma-derived TAFI, and covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B as described (17Gils A. Alessi M.C. Brouwers E. Peeters M. Marx P. Leurs J. Bouma B. Hendriks D. Juhan-Vague I. Declerck P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1122-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Construction, Expression, and Purification of TAFI Variants—The pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen) with the cDNA coding for TAFI (pcDNA-TAFI) was used as the template for mutagenesis (17Gils A. Alessi M.C. Brouwers E. Peeters M. Marx P. Leurs J. Bouma B. Hendriks D. Juhan-Vague I. Declerck P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1122-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Genemorph® II EZClone domain mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create a library of random TAFI mutants harboring Thr147 and Ile325 (pcDNA-TAFI-TI) using the primers 5′-CGTACTATGAACAGTATCACTCAC-3′ and 5′-CATTCCTAATGACATGCCAAGCTAT-3′ (mutagenesis was restricted to the enzyme moiety, amino acid 96–401). Site-directed mutagenesis of TAFI, harboring Ala147 and Thr325 (pcDNA-TAFI-AT), to introduce Cys point mutations was performed with the QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutants were transiently transfected in HEK293T cells using the Lipofectamine™ 2000 protocol (Invitrogen). Media were harvested 96 h after transfection. Purification of TAFI mutants was performed by immunoaffinity chromatography using monoclonal antibodies T4E3 as described previously (17Gils A. Alessi M.C. Brouwers E. Peeters M. Marx P. Leurs J. Bouma B. Hendriks D. Juhan-Vague I. Declerck P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1122-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Determination of TAFIa Stability—The TAFIa activity was measured as described earlier (13Mosnier L.O. von-dem-Borne P.A. Meijers J.C. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). TAFI (90 nm) was activated with thrombin (20 nm), thrombomodulin (5 nm), and CaCl2 (5 mm) in 60 μl of Hepesbovine serum albumin (BSA) buffer (25 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% BSA) for 2 min at 37 °C. Thrombin-induced activation was stopped at the indicated time points by the addition of 20 μl of PPACK (30 μm final concentration). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for different time intervals. Twenty μl of the substrate Hip-Arg (5 mm final concentration) was added, and substrate conversion was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 22 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 1 n HCl followed by 20 μl of 1 n NaOH and 25 μl of 1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Subsequently, 30 μl of 6% cyanuric chloride dissolved in 1,4-dioxane was added, and the mixtures were vortexed and centrifuged. One hundred microliters of supernatant was transferred into a 96-well microtiter plate, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured using an EL808 Ultra Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek instruments Inc). The calculated activity was expressed as a fraction of the initial activity (i.e. of the sample that was not incubated at 37 °C after the addition of PPACK). Data were analyzed according to a one-phase exponential decay function. Decay constants (K) were used to calculate the half-lives according to the equation K = 0.693/t½. Inhibition of TAFIa Activity by PTCI—TAFI (90 nm) was activated with T/TM for 2 min as described above. Reactions were stopped with PPACK (30 μm) followed by 10 min of incubation at 22 °C with PTCI (0.05–5 μm) before the addition of the chromogenic substrate (Hip-Arg) for determination of TAFIa activity as described above. TAFI Activation by Thrombin/Thrombomodulin—TAFI (0.06–1 μm) was activated for different time intervals (ranging between 0 and 4 min) in the presence of CaCl2 (5 mm), thrombin (4 nm), and thrombomodulin (1 nm) in Hepes-bovine serum albumin buffer. Under these conditions less than 20% of total TAFI was converted to TAFIa, and rates of activation were linear over the time of measurements. Activation was stopped by the addition of PPACK (30 μm). Samples were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C with Hip-Arg. The amount of TAFIa generated after each activation time was obtained using standard calibration curves (absorbance/min/nm TAFIa). The kcat and Km values for activation of each TAFI variant were determined by nonlinear regression of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Graph Pad Prism 4.01. TAFIa Hydrolysis of Hippuryl-l-arginine—Characterization of TAFIa hydrolysis of Hip-Arg was determined as described previously with some modifications (5Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, TAFI (1 μm) was incubated for 15 min at 22 °C in the presence of CaCl2 (5 mm), thrombin (20 nm), and thrombomodulin (80 nm) in Hepes buffer. Under these conditions, TAFI is quantitatively converted to TAFIa without conversion to TAFIai (confirmed with SDS-PAGE analysis in parallel with measurement of TAFIa activity). Thrombin activity was stopped by the addition of PPACK (30 μm). Hydrolysis of Hip-Arg (0.1–2 mm) was monitored at 254 nm in a Powerwave X spectrophotometer thermostatted at 25 °C (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc). Reactions were performed in half area UV 96-well microtiter plates (Elscolab). For each substrate concentration, the rate of hydrolysis was linear over the time of measurement, and initial rates were determined under conditions where less than 10% of the substrate was hydrolyzed. The formation of hippuric acid was calculated from the change in absorbance at 254 nm using the change in extinction coefficient that occurs upon hydrolysis of Hip-Arg (Δε Hip-Arg → hippuric acid = 0.524 mm–1 cm–1) as published previously (5Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Kinetic constants for the hydrolysis of Hip-Arg by the different TAFI variants were obtained by fitting the rates of substrate hydrolysis to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Graph Pad Prism 4.01. Evaluation of Generated TAFI Fragments upon Activation with Thrombin/Thrombomodulin—TAFI (410 nm) was incubated with thrombin (20 nm), thrombomodulin (5 nm), and CaCl2 (5 mm) in 60 μl of Tris buffer (20 mm Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 210, 240, or 280 min. The reactions were stopped at the indicated time points by the addition of SDS (1% final concentration). The samples were heated for 30 s at 100 °C and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Clot Lysis Assay—A series of identical clots was formed: TAFI (0.7–90 nm in Hepes buffer, Hepes 20 mm, pH 7.4), tissue plasminogen activator (40 ng/ml in Hepes buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20), thrombomodulin (5 nm in Hepes buffer), thrombin (20 nm in Hepes buffer), and CaCl2 (12.5 mm in Hepes buffer) were added to TAFI-depleted plasma (½ final dilution). The change in turbidity was followed every 5 min at 405 nm (during a 7-h time course) with an EL808 Ultra Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek instruments Inc) to determine the 50% clot lysis time (i.e. the time from the maximum turbidity to the midpoint between maximum and return to base line). Additional experiments were performed in which clot formation and dissolution were monitored in the presence of 4 μm PTCI. Statistical Analysis—Quantitative data were summarized by the mean and S.D. Statistical analyses were performed with Graph Pad Prism 4.01 using the unpaired t test (Graph Pad Software, Inc., San Diego, USA). p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Generation of TAFI Mutants; Targeted Strategy—The rationale for the site-directed mutagenesis was to hamper the conformational change of TAFIa, which consequently leads to the inactivation of TAFIa followed by an increased susceptibility to cleavage at position Arg302. Therefore, connecting the 25- and 11-kDa moieties by disulfide bridges (formed by introducing two new Cys residues in the TAFIa molecule) seems to be a reasonable approach. Thus, 25 single and double Cys point mutants were constructed in the Glu99-Tyr101, Ala167-Leu189, Ile294-Ala315, and Glu376-Ile398 regions. These mutants were generated in pcDNA-TAFI-AT and transiently transfected in eukaryotic cells. Conditioned media of the different TAFI mutants were screened for TAFI protein expression, TAFIa activity, and TAFIa stability (data not shown). Only one TAFIa variant, carrying a Ser305 to Cys mutation, had an increased half-life at 37 °C (i.e. 5.8-fold increased versus TAFIa-AT). The introduction of all other mutations in the TAFIa molecule revealed no significant effect on TAFIa stability except for the Trp171 to Cys mutant, which exhibited a 2.4-fold increased TAFIa half-life versus TAFIa-AT. Generation of TAFI Mutants; Random Strategy—A library of random TAFIa-TI mutants was generated and transiently transfected in eukaryotic cells. Initially, conditioned media of 250 clones were screened for TAFI protein expression, TAFIa activity, and TAFIa stability (data not shown). This resulted in the identification of a Thr329 to Ile mutation, revealing a 1.7-fold increased TAFIa half-life at 37 °C. Subsequent to these findings the Cys305 mutation (cfr targeted strategy) and the Ile329 mutation (cfr random strategy) were introduced in TAFI-AI either individually or combined, resulting in TAFI-AI-Cys305, TAFI-AI-Ile329, TAFI-AI-Cys305-Ile329. TAFI-AT, TAFI-AI, TAFI-AI-Cys305, TAFI-AI-Ile329, and TAFI-AI-Cys305-Ile329 were purified and characterized. Effect of Mutations on TAFIa Stability—The stability of the different TAFIa variants was evaluated at 37 °C. The half-lives of TAFIa-AT and TAFIa-AI were 6.3 ± 0.3 and 9.4 ± 0.4 min, respectively. TAFIa-AI-Ile329, TAFIa-AI-Cys305, and TAFIa-AI-Cys305-Ile329 revealed half-lives of 15 ± 1.6, 41 ± 3.1, and 70 ± 3.1 min, respectively, corresponding to a 2.4-fold (p < 0.05), 6.4-fold (p < 0.005), and 11-fold (p < 0.005) increase versus TAFIa-AT, respectively (Table 1; Fig. 1).TABLE 1Characteristics of TAFI mutantsTAFI variantHalf-life (at 37 °C)IC50 PTCI50% clot lysis time-PTCI+PTCIminnmminTAFI-depleted plasmaNANA21 ± 522 ± 6TAFI-AT6.3 ± 0.378 ± 9117 ± 1022 ± 7TAFI-AI9.4 ± 0.497 ± 14164 ± 1623 ± 6TAFI-AI-Ile32915 ± 284 ± 16185 ± 5023 ± 7TAFI-AI-Cys30541 ± 384 ± 20276 ± 3720 ± 6TAFI-AI-Cys305-Ile32970 ± 397 ± 29313 ± 7719 ± 5 Open table in a new tab Inhibition of TAFIa Activity by PTCI—TAFIa-AT, TAFIa-AI, TAFIa-AI-Ile329, TAFIa-AI-Cys305, and TAFIa-AI-Cys305-Ile329 were equally well inhibited by PTCI, a specific inhibitor of TAFIa (Table 1). Fifty percent inhibition was observed upon the addition of 78–97 nm PTCI. TAFI Activation by Thrombin/Thrombomodulin—The ability of the T/TM complex to activate the different TAFI variants (0.06–1 μm) was evaluated. The initial rates of TAFIa formation were assessed by measurement of Hip-Arg hydrolysis. Double-reciprocal plots of activation rate versus substrate (TAFI) concentration were linear (r2 = 0.98), confirming Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The kinetic parameters were determined by non-linear regression of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The combination of a more than 2-fold increased affinity (Km) (Table 2) and an almost 2-fold increased catalytic rate (kcat) lead to3–6-fold increased catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of TAFI activation by T/TM for the TAFI variants bearing Cys305 (compared with TAFI-AT). TAFI-AI and TAFI-AI-Ile329 revealed a 2-fold higher catalytic efficiency for activation by T/TM compared with TAFI-AT.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters for activation of TAFI variants by thrombin/thrombomodulinTAFI variantKmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1s-1 μm-1TAFI-AT0.34-0.35aRange, n = 2.0.23-0.250.66-0.74TAFI-AI0.20-0.210.37-0.411.85-1.95TAFI-AI-Ile3290.18-0.240.27-0.351.46-1.50TAFI-AI-Cys3050.06-0.110.35-0.444.00-5.83TAFI-AI-Cys305-Ile3290.11-0.210.32-0.381.81-2.91a Range, n = 2.

Double reciprocal plots of hydrolysis rate versus substrate (Hip-Arg) concentration were linear (r2 = 0.95), confirming Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The kinetic parameters were determined by non-linear regression of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) (Table 3) for converting the substrate Hip-Arg by TAFIa-AI-Ile329, TAFIa-AI-Cys305, and TAFIa-AI-Cys305-Ile329 was significantly lower than these for TAFIa-AT and TAFIa-AI (p < 0.05) due to a strongly decreased catalytic rate (kcat).TABLE 3Kinetic parameters for hippuryl-l-arginine hydrolysis by TAFIa variants (mean ± S.D., n = 3)TAFI variantKmkcatkcat/Kmmms-1s-1 mm-1TAFI-AT2.4 ± 0.323 ± 310 ± 2TAFI-AI1.5 ± 0.416 ± 311 ± 1TAFI-AI-Ile3291.4 ± 1.34.2 ± 2.63.7 ± 1.1TAFI-AI-Cys3050.7 ± 0.32.4 ± 0.73.8 ± 1.1TAFI-AI-Cys305-Ile3291.0 ± 0.24.4 ± 1.24.2 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab Fragmentation Pattern of TAFI Variants upon Activation with Thrombin/Thrombomodulin—Upon activation of TAFI-AT, a 36-kDa band corresponding to TAFIa is generated after 5 min at 37 °C (Fig. 2A). Subsequently, after 20 min, the typical degradation products of 25 and 11 kDa are formed. The activation peptide of TAFI has a theoretical Mr of 19.4 kDa (with carbohydrate). In agreement with the literature, no distinct activation peptide after activation of TAFI was detected using SDS-PAGE and silver staining (8Schatteman K.A. Goossens F.J. Scharpe S.S. Hendriks D.F.

Upon activation of TAFI-AI-Cys305 (data not shown) and TAFI-AI-Cys305-Ile329 (Fig. 2B), a 36-kDa band corresponding to TAFIa is generated after 5 min at 37 °C. In contrast to the other TAFI variants, the formation of the 25- and 11-kDa degradation products is delayed as could be expected from their prolonged half-life. Effect of TAFI Variants in a Clot Lysis Assay—The addition of TAFI-AT (90 nm) to TAFI-depleted plasma results in a significant increase of the 50% clot lysis time (i.e. 117 ± 10 min versus 21 ± 5.2 min, p < 0.005) (Table 1, Fig. 3A). The addition of TAFI-AI (90 nm) to TAFI-depleted plasma results in a 50% clot lysis time of 164 ± 16 min, corresponding to a 1.5-fold increased antifibrinolytic effect versus TAFI-AT (p < 0.005). The addition of TAFI-AI-Ile329, TAFI-AI-Cys305, and TAFI-AI-Cys305-Ile329 mutants (90 nm) to TAFI-depleted plasma results in 50% clot lysis times of 185 ± 50, 276 ± 37, and 313 ± 77 min, respectively, corresponding to a 1.7-fold (p < 0.05), 2.7-fold (p < 0.05), and 3.0-fold (p < 0.05) increased antifibrinolytic effect, respectively, versus TAFI-AT. PTCI used at a concentration of 4 μm fully reverses the effect of all TAFI variants in the clot lysis assay (Table 1). TAFIa (36 kDa) is formed upon activation of TAFI (56 kDa) and exerts an antifibrinolytic effect. Regulated by an intrinsic temperature-dependent instability (i.e. half-life between 5 and 15 min at 37 °C), TAFIa converts into an inactive conformation that is prone to further proteolytic cleavage resulting in the formation of 25- and 11-kDa fragments. The exact nature of the TAFIa instability is still unknown. However, it is shown that TAFIa variants bearing Ile at position 325 have a 2-fold increased half-life at 37 °C that results in a 1.6-fold higher antifibrinolytic effect (6Schneider M. Boffa M.B. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Boffa et al. (7Boffa M.B. Bell R. Stevens W.K.

We hypothesized that this region, which bears only 13% sequence identity with pCPB, a stable protease with an overall sequence identity of 48% with TAFIa, determines TAFIa stability. Marx et al. (16Marx P.F. Havik S.R. Marquart J.A. Bouma B.N. Meijers J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6620-6628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) created a TAFI-pCPB chimera in which the 293–401-amino acid region of TAFI was substituted with the corresponding amino acids of pCPB. Although this chimera revealed an increased TAFIa stability, it lost most of its antifibrinolytic potential. Based on the three-dimensional structure of pCPB, Barbosa-Pereira et al. (21Barbosa-Pereira P.J. Segura-Martin S. Oliva B. Ferrer-Orta C. Aviles F.X. Coll M. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Vendrell J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) proposed a TAFI model and suggested that Ile182 and Ile183 contribute to the instability of TAFIa. However, recent data of Marx et al. (9Marx P.F. Havik S.R. Bouma B.N. Meijers J.C. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 1293-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) revealed that replacing Ile182 by Arg and Ile183 by Glu (as in pCPB) does not result in an increased TAFIa stability. In contrast, mutating these residues resulted in a lower rate of TAFI activation and, in accordance, in a 6-fold reduced antifibrinolytic potential. The goal of the current study was to create a TAFIa mutant with an increased half-life at 37 °C and a concomitant increased antifibrinolytic effect. Therefore, we combined two different approaches. First, site-directed mutagenesis in well defined regions yielded a TAFI mutant (TAFI-AT-Cys305) with a 5.8-fold increased TAFIa half-life upon activation. Second, random mutagenesis identified a 1.7-fold stabilizing effect of Ile at position 329. These two stabilizing mutations, either individually or combined, were introduced in the TAFI isoform, which yields the most stable TAFIa (i.e. TAFI-AI). Combining Cys305, Ile325, and Ile329 revealed a synergistic effect on both TAFIa half-life (i.e. 11-fold increased at 37 °C) and 50% clot lysis time (3.0-fold increased when 90 nm TAFI is added). From these data we can deduce that the introduction of Cys305, Ile325, and Ile329 slows down the conformational change responsible for the inactivation of TAFIa (7Boffa M.B. Bell R. Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12868-12878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The delayed formation of 25- and 11-kDa products of the TAFI-AI-Cys305 and TAFI-AI-Cys305-Ile329 variants support these data (Fig. 2). The stronger antifibrinolytic effect of all TAFIa variants is in agreement with their increased functional half-life and can be explained at least in part by the threshold phenomenon (22Leurs J. Nerme V. Sim Y. Hendriks D. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 2: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Walker J.B. Bajzar L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27896-27904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). According to the threshold phenomenon, clot lysis is prevented from proceeding into the propagation phase as long as TAFIa activity remains above a threshold value. As demonstrated before by Schneider et al. (6Schneider M. Boffa M.B. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the increase in clot lysis time cannot be overcome by adding increasing amounts of TAFI (Fig. 3A). As expected, clot lysis time could only be further increased by increasing the stability of TAFIa (Fig. 3A). Under the current conditions, clot lysis times reached a maximum when TAFI concentrations between 45 and 90 nm were used (for all TAFI variants). This maximum could only be increased by increasing the TAFIa half-life to 40 min. Using these TAFIa variants, a maximum is reached between 270 and 320 min (Table 1; Fig. 3, A and B). Although we cannot exclude that this maximal effect is due to different activation rates by T/TM and/or to different enzyme activities, this maximal effect was also previously observed by Schneider and Nesheim (24Schneider M. Nesheim M. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and Walker et al. (18Walker J.B. Hughes B. James I. Haddock P. Kluft C. Bajzar L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8913-8921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), who reported maximal clot lysis times of 350 and 250 min, respectively. In contrast to previous published results (6Schneider M. Boffa M.B. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we found that the catalytic efficiency for activation of TAFI-AI by T/TM is 2-fold higher than for TAFI-AT. Introduction of Cys305 increases the catalytic efficiency for activation of TAFI by T/TM again 2-fold (Table 2, kcat/Km). However, introducing either Cys305 or Ile329 leads to a more than 2-fold lower catalytic efficiency for converting the substrate Hip-Arg compared with the two naturally occurring variants, TAFIa-AT and TAFIa-AI (Table 3, kcat/Km). This is probably due to the influence of the introduced mutations, Cys305 and Ile329, on the active site conformation. The 3 stabilizing mutations are located in the 300–330-amino acid region (Fig. 4), forming mainly anα-helix (residues 308–325) and two loops (residues 297–307 and 326–331, respectively) connecting the helix to the main part of the molecule. It is worth mentioning that the residues at positions 305 and 329 are in very close proximity to theα-helix (4.96 and 4.21 Ä, respectively). Most likely thisα-helix, the two loops, and their mutual interactions govern in part the conformational change accompanied with the inactivation process. These data are also in line with previous studies indicating that mutations in this region result in a destabilization (7Boffa M.B. Bell R. Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12868-12878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Marx P.F. Havik S.R. Marquart J.A. Bouma B.N. Meijers J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6620-6628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we were able to identify, in addition to the naturally occurring Ile325, two stabilizing mutations i.e. Cys305 and Ile329, that increase synergistically the TAFIa half-life. Subsequently, our study demonstrates that the half-life of TAFIa has an important impact on its antifibrinolytic potential. We observed that by increasing the TAFIa stability, the clot lysis time can be maximally increased to 300 min. Because the development of a TAFI(a) inhibitor is limited by the half-life of TAFIa, the availability of a more stable TAFIa variant will raise new opportunities in the search for TAFIa inhibitors. Moreover, the availability of a stabilized variant will also facilitate further structural analysis to obtain more insights in the underlying mechanisms of the instability of TAFIa.

Extant structures for this superfamily identify an aspartate residue that either directly (24Lois L.M. Lima C.D.

The importance of this residue is suggested by its absolute conservation among MoeB and E1 paralogs as well as the dramatic effects of point mutagenesis. Mutation of Asp130 to alanine abrogates MoeB activity in E. coli (21Lake M.W. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nature. 2001; 414: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), whereas mutations of the paralogous Asp146 of Uba3 or Asp117 of Sae2 significantly ablate Nedd8 and Sumo activation by human AppBp1-Uba3 or Sae1-Sae2 heterodimers, respectively (22Walden H. Podgorski M.S. Schulman B.A. Nature. 2003; 422: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 24Lois L.M. Lima C.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, loss-of-function mutations are rarely informative without additional studies, since the phenotype cannot be unambiguously interpreted. Thus, whereas the loss-of-function mutations that arise from nonconservative changes in Asp130 and its paralogous residues are consistent with their predicted roles in ATP·Mg2+ binding, collateral mechanistic and/or structural effects cannot be precluded. To understand more completely the mechanistic contribution of the aspartate residue in the catalytic cycle of human ubiquitin-activating enzyme and its paralogs, we have introduced a series of point mutations at Asp576 of human Uba1a that corresponds to Asp130 of E. coli MoeB, Asp146 of human Uba3, and Asp117 of human Sae2. Kinetic analyses confirm a role for Asp576 in ATP·Mg2+ binding. However, the point mutants also exhibit pleiotropic effects on the mechanism of ubiquitin activation, including transition state stabilization and order of substrate binding, that reveal a more complex role not anticipated in earlier studies. Such insights identify Asp576 and its paralogs as critical catalytic residues in the reaction cycle of this enzyme family. Bovine ubiquitin, creatine phosphokinase, and yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase were purchased from Sigma. The ubiquitin was further purified to apparent homogeneity and then radioiodinated by the chloramine-T procedure (25Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 26Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recombinant human HsUbc2b and the active site mutant HsUbc2bC88A were those described previously (27Siepmann T.J. Bohnsack R.N. Tokgõz Z. Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9448-9457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Generation of GST-HsUba1a Point Mutants—A pGEX3X-E1 construct encoding the nuclear form of the human ubiquitin-activating enzyme (HsUba1a), generously provided by Dr. Alan L. Schwartz (Washington University School of Medicine), was used for the expression of wild type and mutant HsUba1a enzymes. The D576A, D576E, and D576N point mutants of HsUba1a were generated by the PCR overlap extension method of Ho et al. (28Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Genes (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar) using pGEX3X-E1 as a template. Point mutations were introduced using internal primers containing the desired mutation and external primers flanking the region of the gene bound by XhoI and Eco72RI restriction sites. Following PCR amplification of the corresponding single site mutations, inserts were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector. The subcloned insert was digested with XhoI/Eco72RI restriction enzymes, agarose gel-purified, and then ligated into a similarly restricted pGEX3X vector. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing the complete XhoI/Eco72RI inserts on an Applied Biosystems ABI Prism 3100 DNA sequencer. Expression and Purification of GST-HsUba1a Wild Type and Mutant Proteins—E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with pGEX3X encoding either wild type or mutant forms of ubiquitin-activating enzyme. Single colonies harboring the appropriate vector (pGEX3X-wtE1, pGEX3X-E1D576A, pGEX3X-E1D576N, or pGEX3X-E1D576E) were inoculated into 50 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and then grown to stationary phase at 30 °C. This culture was used to inoculate 500 ml of LB-ampicillin medium at a final dilution of 1:25 and then grown to an A600 of 0.6 at 30 °C with constant shaking. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.3 mm, after which the culture was allowed to grow an additional 2 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and then resuspended in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. All subsequent steps were conducted at 4 °C. The resuspended cells were lysed by a French press, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-agarose affinity column (Sigma) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm DTT. The GST wild type and mutant human Uba1a fusions were eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm DTT and then dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT. The purified proteins were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting and subsequent visualization using anti-GST antibodies and ECL detection. Protein concentrations for full-length wild type and mutant HsUba1a enzymes were normalized to GST content using quantitative Western blotting. Enzyme Assays—Concentrations of active wild type and mutant GST-HsUba1a enzymes were determined by the stoichiometric formation of 125I-ubiquitin thiolester from free radioiodinated ubiquitin (∼5000 cpm/pmol) in end point assays, followed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE resolution and γ counting of associated 125I radioactivity in excised bands (16Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme-bound ubiquitin [3H]adenylate formation was determined using [2,8-3H]ATP (3.6 × 104 cpm/pmol) and measured by trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity (16Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial rates of ATP/32PPi exchange were measured at the indicated concentrations of ATP, ubiquitin, 32PPi, and either GST-HsUba1a or the corresponding Asp576 or Lys528 mutants (17Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial rates of HsUbc2b-125I-ubiquitin thiolester formation were measured by nonreducing SDS-PAGE in HsUba1a-catalyzed transthiolation assays at the indicated concentrations of ATP, 125I-ubiquitin, and recombinant HsUbc2b (27Siepmann T.J. Bohnsack R.N. Tokgõz Z. Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9448-9457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For Asp576 mutants of GST-HsUba1a, initial rates of HsUba1a-125I-ubiquitin thiolester formation were measured directly by modification of the E2 transthiolation assay (27Siepmann T.J. Bohnsack R.N. Tokgõz Z. Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9448-9457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Only Full-length GST-HsUba1a Is Active—Expression of wild type or mutant GST-HsUba1a consistently yielded a mixture of full-length protein (Mr 136,000) and a ladder of GST-linked fusion protein fragments when detected by Coomassie staining after SDS-PAGE resolution (not shown) or by Western blot using anti-GST antibodies (Fig. 1). Although the protein expression yielded a mixture of full-length and partially degraded fusion protein, only full-length GST-HsUba1a was active in forming the corresponding 125I-ubiquitin thiolester (Fig. 1). The amount of GST-HsUba1a-125I-ubiquitin thiolester calculated from the specific radioactivity of the labeled polypeptide agreed well with that predicted from the protein content of the full-length GST-HsUba1a fusion protein estimated by Coomassie staining and comparison with a known amount of bovine serum albumin (not shown). Thus, a carboxyl-terminal segment of 20 kDa, representing ∼170 amino acids, is essential for the activity of HsUba1. The cleavage point for this fragment lies between the predicted carboxyl-terminal β-grasp domain common to all members of the E1 superfamily (22Walden H. Podgorski M.S. Schulman B.A. Nature. 2003; 422: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and the thiolester active site located at Cys632. However, other studies showed that truncation of the 118-residue predicted β-grasp domain from the carboxyl terminus of HsUba1a had no effect on the stoichiometry of the resulting mutant 6Z. Tokgöz and A. L. Haas, unpublished observation. ; therefore, the critical region must lie within a 52-amino acid segment between residues 888 and 940 of the intact protein. Crystal structures for MoeB, AppBp1-Uba3, and Sae1-Sae2 show that the paralogous regions for the latter critical segment comprise a buried α helix and two runs of antiparallel β sheet that constitute a contact face with their respective ubiquitin-like proteins. Therefore, truncation of this segment reasonably explains complete inactivation of the enzyme by abolishing binding of the β-grasp polypeptide cosubstrate. Parallel end point determinations of 125I-ubiquitin thiolester and ubiquitin [3H]adenylate formation with wild type GST-HsUba1a were conducted as described under “Materials and Methods,” the results of which are summarized in Table 1. The observed end point thiolester versus adenylate stoichiometry of 1.1 for the wild type GST-HsUba1a agreed well with the expected value of 1.0 reported for rabbit reticulocyte and human erythrocyte ubiquitin-activating enzymes (16Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Siepmann T.J. Bohnsack R.N. Tokgõz Z. Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol.

Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26823-26830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These observations are important, since they indicate that the GST-HsUba1a degradation products are catalytically inactive within the resolution of the 125I-ubiquitin thiolester and ubiquitin [3H]adenylate stoichiometry assays and, therefore, should not significantly contribute to subsequent kinetic studies conducted with either wild type or mutant fusion proteins.TABLE 1Stoichiometry of GST-HsUba1a ternary complexes125I-Ub thiolesterUb [3H]adenylatepmolGST-HsUba1a (wild type)1.40 ± 0.101.32 ± 0.03GST-HsUba1aD576A0.80 ± 0.060.007 ± 0.001GST-HsUba1aD576E1.50 ± 0.060.008 ± 0.002GST-HsUba1aD576N0.40 ± 0.070.008 ± 0.001GST-HsUba1aK528A1.44 ± 0.070.002 ± 0.001 Open table in a new tab Recombinant GST-HsUba1a Shows Wild Type Kinetics—We have previously shown that the kinetics for HsUba1-catalyzed transthiolation of HsUbc2b can be used as a reporter assay for determining the Km and kcat values for the three cosubstrates of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (27Siepmann T.J. Bohnsack R.N. Tokgõz Z. Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9448-9457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Similar studies monitoring the kinetics of HsUbc12-125I-Nedd8 thiolester formation catalyzed by heterodimeric AppBp1-Uba3 demonstrate remarkable conservation in mechanism and cosubstrate affinities with respect to the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (29Bohnsack R.N. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26823-26830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Such E2 transthiolation assays are more sensitive to the potential presence of trace catalytically active fragments than the single turnover end point assays used for quantitating ternary complex stoichiometry, since the former require accumulation of product over multiple catalytic cycles. In this approach, the presence of two or more catalytically active species differing in Km, kcat, or both (as might be expected for degradation products of GST-HsUba1a) is indicated by deviation from strict hyperbolic kinetics and manifests as nonlinear double reciprocal plots of 1/vo versus 1/[substrate]o (30Segal I.A. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar). Initial velocity experiments with wild type GST-HsUba1a revealed strict hyperbolic kinetics based on the linearity of double reciprocal plots when ATP·Mg2+, 125I-ubiquitin, or HsUbc2b was varied at saturating concentrations of the other cosubstrates (not shown). Values of Km and kcat, the latter defined as Vmax/[GST-HsUba1a]o, were calculated from nonlinear regression analyses of the respective data sets and are summarized in Table 2. In the presence of saturating 125I-ubiquitin (5 μm) and recombinant HsUbc2b (0.5 μm), the Km of 5.5 ± 0.7 μm for ATP was in good agreement with the value of 7.0 ± 1.1 μm reported for wild type human erythrocyte Uba1 (27Siepmann T.J.

Likewise, when [125I-ubiquitin]o was varied at saturating ATP·Mg2+ (2 mm) and HsUbc2b (0.5 μm), wild type GST-HsUba1a exhibited a Km of 0.8 ± 0.1 μm for radiolabeled ubiquitin that was identical to that previously determined for human erythrocyte Uba1 (27Siepmann T.J.

Finally, the concentration dependence for the initial rate of HsUbc2b transthiolation versus [HsUbc2b]o at saturating ATP·Mg2+ (2 mm) and 125I-ubiquitin (5 μm) yielded a Km of 111 ± 6nm that was in excellent agreement with the value of 123 ± 19 nm determined earlier for the human erythrocyte enzyme (27Siepmann T.J.

The intrinsic kcat for HsUbc2b transthiolation (kcat,trans) corresponded to 3.4 ± 0.1 s–1 when calculated from the Vmax for GST-HsUba1a-catalyzed transthiolation in the latter experiment (Table 2) and agreed well with the value of 4.5 ± 0.3 s–1 for erythrocyte HsUba1 (27Siepmann T.J.

Open table in a new tab The kinetic data demonstrate that the amino-terminal GST moiety has no measurable effect on the affinities of cosubstrate binding, reflected in the respective Km values, or the catalytic competence of the recombinant enzyme, reflected in the kcat values, since GST-HsUba1a was kinetically indistinguishable from the wild type activating enzyme isolated from human erythrocytes. This conclusion is in concordance with the similar end point stoichiometries for wild type and GST-HsUba1a ternary complexes (Table 1) and is understandable, since the predicted spatial orientation of the amino-terminal GST domain is well removed from the cosubstrate binding sites, based on the structure for human AppBp1-Uba3 and Sae1-Sae2 paralogs (22Walden H.

We assessed organ (renal) protection by the highly lipophilic CCB lercanidipine in a double-transgenic rat (dTGR) model with overexpression of human renin and angiotensinogen genes. We randomly treated dTGR with lercanidipine (2.5 mg/kg/day; n=20) or vehicle (n=20) for 3 wk. Furthermore, we explored the influence of lercanidipine on protein kinase C (PKC) signaling in vivo and in vitro using endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell cultures. Cumulative mortality was 60% in untreated dTGR, whereas none of the lercanidipine-treated animals died (P<0.001). We found significantly less albuminuria and improved renal function in lercanidipine-treated dTGR (both P<0.05). Lercanidipine treatment also significantly (P<0.05) reduced blood levels of the endogenous NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine. On histological examination, we observed significantly less tissue inflammation and fibrosis in lercanidipine-treated animals (both P<0.05). Lercanidipine significantly inhibited angiotensin (ANG) I-mediated PKC-alpha and -delta activation in vivo and in vitro, partly due to reduced intracellular calcium flux. As a result, lercanidipine improved endothelial cell permeability in vitro. Lercanidipine prevents tissue injury and improves survival in a model of progressive organ damage. These effects may result, at least in part, from inhibition of tissue inflammation as well as improved NO bioavailability. Modulation of PKC activity may be an important underlying intracellular mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1999559385,"Tat-interactive protein 60 (Tip60) is a member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs). In addition to its HAT domain, Tip contains a heterochromatin-associated protein 1-like chromodomain and a zinc finger-like domain. Several alternative splice variants of <i>Tip60</i> have been characterized, including full-length <i>Tip60</i>α, <i>Tip60</i>β (which lacks exon V encoded by the <i>Tip60</i> gene), and <i>Tip55</i> (which encodes a novel 103-amino-acid C terminus). We report here that isoproteins recognized by a pan-Tip60 antibody are strongly and transiently expressed between embryonic days 8 and 11 in the embryonic mouse myocardium. A functional role for Tip60 isoproteins in cardiac myocyte differentiation is suggested by immunoprecipitation experiments showing that Tip60α, Tip60β, and Tip55 can bind serum response factor (SRF) and by transient transfection assessments showing that Tip60 and SRF cooperatively activate the atrial natriuretic factor promoter. Although this combinatorial activity is inhibited by histone deacetylase 7, it was unexpectedly enhanced by point mutation of the HAT domain. Ablation of the chromodomain from Tip60β caused derepression. These findings suggest that Tip60 modulates expression of SRF-dependent cardiac genes."

Although the transcriptional control of TNFSF6 gene expression is subjected to intense study, the role of its chromatin organization and accessibility to the transcriptional machinery is not known. Here, we determined the chromatin organization of TNFSF6 gene 5′ regulatory regions. Using the indirect end-labeling technique, a unique region named HSS1 and encompassing nucleotides –189 to +185 according to the transcriptional start site, was identified throughout a 20-kilobase nucleosomal DNA domain surrounding the promoter. The HSS1 region displayed hypersensitivity to in vivo DNase I digestion in TNFSF6-expressing cells only, including upon T cell activation. Hypersensitivity to micrococcal nuclease digestion and to specific restriction enzyme digestion suggested the precise positioning of two nucleosomes across the transcription start site and minimal promoter region, likely interfering with TNFSF6 active transcription in T lymphocytes. Indeed, HSS1 hypersensitivity to nuclease digestion strictly correlated with TNFSF6 transcription, including in primary and leukemia T cells. HSS1 chromatin remodeling preceded detectable TNFSF6 mRNA accumulation and was blocked by cycloheximide that also prevented TNFSF6 transcription. However, DNA methylation levels of the TNFSF6 HSS1 region did not correlate with transcriptional activation. Induction of global protein acetylation by treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors was not accompanied by HSS1 chromatin remodeling and/or TNFSF6 transcription. We conclude that chromatin remodeling is a primary event in the activation of TNFSF6 expression in primary and leukemia T cells and that mechanisms independent of protein deacetylation and of DNA methylation of the TNFSF6 promoter region are involved in the repression of TNFSF6 gene expression.

The TNFSF family related members are type II transmembrane proteins. Besides of their role in many important biological processes such as development, organogenesis, immunity, cell death, and survival, TNFSFs are implicated in various acquired or genetic human diseases ranging from septic shock to autoimmune disorders, allograft rejection, viral infections, and cancer (1Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar). Hence, various therapeutic approaches aim to target these molecules, and there has been much interest toward the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms controlling their expression. TNFSF family member expression is contextually dependent on the nature, differentiation, activation, and cell cycle status of producing tissues. The regulated expression of the TNFSF genes implicates not only transcriptional but also post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms, together ensuring appropriate spatiotemporal expression. Escape of this tightly controlled expression has been described in various pathological conditions, including viral infections or neoplasm. TNFSF6 (FasL/CD95L) is a key player in T lymphocyte homeostasis and cytolytic effector functions through the aggregation of its apoptosis inducing receptor, TNFRSF6 (Fas/CD95).

Hence, tightly controlled expression of TNFSF6 is required for proper immune functions. Whereas TNFRSF6 is largely distributed in various tissues, initial studies described a more restricted expression of TNFSF6 confined to immune cells, with the exception of Sertoli cells and epithelial cells of the anterior chamber of the eye (11Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar, 12Griffith T.S. Brunner T. Fletcher S.M. Green D.R. Ferguson T.A.

Nature. 1995; 377: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). In resting T lymphocytes, TNFSF6 mRNA is absent or very low but is rapidly and transiently up-regulated upon T cell activation (11Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar, 14Suda T. Okazaki T. Naito Y. Yokota T. Arai N. Ozaki S. Nakao K. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3806-3813PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have emphasized further the transcriptional control of TNFSF6 expression and have identified, cloned, and characterized the human and mouse TNFSF6 promoter-enhancer regions. NF-AT, but also NF-κB, Sp1, Egr-2 and -3, AP-1, Ets-1, and c-Myc transcription factors were shown to participate to TNFSF6 transcription (15Faris M. Latinis K.M. Kempiak S.J. Koretzky G.A. Nel A.

Indeed, induced expression of TNFSF6 at the cell surface of activated T lymphocytes is inhibited by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the calcineurin phosphatase implicated in the regulation of NF-AT transcription factor activity and expression (29Anel A. Buferne M. Boyer C. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Golstein P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2469-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The generation of transgenic mice in which the TNFSF6 promoter sequence controls the expression of a reporter gene evidenced a similar pattern of expression of the transgene and the endogenous gene in primary T lymphocytes, underscoring the role of these 5′-regulatory regions in TNFSF6 expression (30Norian L.A. Latinis K.M. Eliason S.L. Lyson K. Yang C. Ratliff T. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4471-4480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Post-translational control of TNFSF6 expression has also been described. The TNFSF6 polypeptide can be sequestered as submembrane vesicles, which are rapidly released to the cell membrane by re-stimulated T lymphocytes (31Li J.H. Rosen D. Ronen D. Behrens C.K. Krammer P.H. Clark W.R. Berke G. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3943-3949PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and membrane-associated TNFSF6 can be processed into a soluble form by matrix metalloproteinases (33Kayagaki N. Kawasaki A. Ebata T. Ohmoto H. Ikeda S. Inoue S. Yoshino K. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 34Tanaka M. Suda T. Haze K. Nakamura N. Sato K. Kimura F. Motoyoshi K. Mizuki M. Tagawa S. Ohga S. Hatake K. Drummond A.H. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Thus, TNFSF6 surface expression is thought to be primarily controlled at the transcriptional level. Gene transcription in eukaryotic cells is controlled by protein complexes, including general and tissue-specific transcription factors, coregulators, chromatin-remodeling complexes, and complexes responsible for signal-specific histone modifications (35Levine M. Tjian R. Nature. 2003; 424: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Because genomic DNA is packaged into chromatin, generally a repressive structure for transcriptional activation, transcription in the context of chromatin requires remodeling processes to reconfigure the chromatin, so that the transcription complexes have access to promoters of target genes (36Fry C.J. Peterson C.L. Science. 2002; 295: 1847-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases are chromatin-modifying enzymes that tightly cooperate with chromatin-remodeling enzymes to regulate accessibility of the template to DNA binding factors and RNA polymerase II (37Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Besides histone acetylation, a variety of other histone and nonhistone protein modifications (phosphorylation, methylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination) as well as modification of DNA itself by methylation regulates transcription initiation (38Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 39Burgers W.A. Fuks F. Kouzarides T.

Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Orchestration of the events required for transcriptional activation is promoter-specific (42Agalioti T.

Chromatin remodeling plays an important role in the regulation of immune functions by controlling the expression of a growing number of key cytokine genes (45Smale S.T. Fisher A.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 427-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For example, during T lymphocyte ontogeny, the differentiation of naïve T lymphocytes into Th1- or Th2-type cytokine-producing cells is accompanied by specific and organized remodeling of the IFNβ and IL-4/IL-5/IL-13 chromatin loci, respectively, characterized by DNase I hypersensitive sites (46Agarwal S. Rao A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 47Bird J.J. Brown D.R. Mullen A.C. Moskowitz N.H. Mahowald M.A. Sider J.R. Gajewski T.F.

The specific and localized remodeling of nucleosomes in the vicinity of the IL-12 p40 and IFNβ promoter regions contribute to their rapid transcription after cell stimulation (for review, see Ref. 45Smale S.T. Fisher A.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 427-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Herein, we considered a possible role for chromatin structure in the regulation of TNFSF6 gene expression. Cells, Culture Conditions, and T Cell Stimulation—All cell culture experiments were performed at 37 °C in 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. The JA16 cells (49Bagnasco M. Nunes J. Lopez M. Cerdan C. Pierres A. Mawas C. Olive D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), a clone of the Jurkat T cell line and the human NK cell lines NK92, and NKL were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10% fetal calf serum). The IL 5The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; CsA, cyclosporin A; CHX, cycloheximide; CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; TSA, trichostatin A; RT, reverse transcription; HSS, hypersensitive site; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; RE, restriction endonuclease; nt, nucleotides. -2-dependent NK cell lines NK92 and NKL were provided by Prof. E. Vivier (Marseille, France) and were cultured with 100 units/ml recombinant human IL-2 and 2 mm l-glutamine. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) peripheral blood samples were obtained after informed consent from patients at diagnosis and before any chemotherapy. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors and from leukemia patients were separated on Ficoll-Hypaque gradients (50Costello R. Cerdan C. Pavon C. Brailly H. Hurpin C. Mawas C. Olive D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). T lymphocytes were isolated by using the Pan T Cell Isolation kit, according to manufacturer's instruction (Miltenyi Biotec). T lymphocytes and the Jurkat T cell line were stimulated with 1 and 20 ng/ml PMA (Saint Louis, MO) and 1 and 2 μg/ml ionomycin (Calbiochem), respectively. Where indicated, the following drugs were used: cyclosporin A (CsA, 50 ng/ml, Calbiochem), cycloheximide (CHX, 20 μm, Sigma), GF109 (1 μm), trichostatin A (TSA, 500 nm, Sigma), valproic acid (5 mm, Sigma), nicotinamide (10 mm, Sigma), and sirtinol (25 μm, Calbiochem). The monoclonal antibody 289 (kindly provided by Alessandro Moretta) recognizes the CD3ζ chain of the T cell receptor complex and was immobilized on plastic culture dishes for T cell receptor stimulation. The anti-human CD28 monoclonal antibody 248 has already been described (51Nunes J. Klasen S. Ragueneau M. Pavon C. Couez D. Mawas C. Bagnasco M. Olive D. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Nuclease Digestion of Purified Nuclei—Exponentially growing cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1600 rpm (Jouan CR4.11) for 10 min at 4 °C and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. All subsequent operations were performed in ice with pre-cooled buffers. Cells were counted and resuspended at 25 × 106 cells/ml in buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m sucrose) and incubated on ice for 10 min, an equal volume of buffer A, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the cells were incubated for another 10 min and resuspended at 108 nuclei/ml in 1 of the 3 buffers depending on the nuclease used for digestion: buffer A for DNase I, buffer A supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2 for micrococcal nuclease, or the specific restriction enzyme buffer for each restriction enzyme. Nuclei were digested for 10 min on ice with DNase I, for 20 min at 22 °C for micrococcal nuclease, and 20 min at the temperature according the manufacturer's protocol for restriction enzymes. Digestion reactions were stopped by adding 1 volume of 2 × proteinase K buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) and mixing. Samples were solubilized for 1 h at 55 °C, proteinase K was added at 400 μg/ml, and digestion was allowed to continue overnight at 55 °C. RNase A was added at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were extracted 3 times with phenol and 2 times with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with ethanol. DNA was resuspended in sterile water, and its concentration was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Southern Blotting—Purified DNA (30 μg for DNase I and micrococcal nuclease and 15 μg for restriction enzyme) was digested with KpnI, and the fragments generated were separated by electrophoresis in 0.8–2% agarose gels in Tris borate buffer. Each size marker was generated by digesting genomic DNA (10 μg) with two restriction enzymes, KpnI and another enzyme chosen to generate a fragment of defined size and location in the region under study. Three of these markers were mixed together and co-electrophoresed with the samples. Agarose gels were incubated 2× 30 min in denaturing solution (1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m NaOH) and 2× 30 min in neutralizing solution (1.5 m NaCl, 1 m Tris pH 7.2) and transferred overnight by capillarity in 20× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate; Invitrogen) to nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences). DNA was cross-linked to nylon membranes by exposure to UV light (UV Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene), washed for 20 min in 2× SSPE, and prehybridized for 2 h at 68°C in hybridization buffer (6× SSC, 1% SDS, 1× Denhart's, 0.1 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA). The probe was synthesized by 25 cycles (95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) of polymerase chain reaction using 100 ng of Jurkat T cell genomic DNA as a template and the primers IEL3AFASL (5′-GTCTACCAGCCAGATGCACACAGC-3′ and 5′-GTACCTCATGACTGCCTCTGTGGG-3′). The amplified products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and purified by using the NucleoSpin Plasmid kit procedure (Macherey-Nagel). DNA fragments were labeled by the random primer reaction (66Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and purified on a G-50 Sephadex column. Denatured DNA probe was added to the hybridization buffer and allowed to hybridize for at least 16 h at 68 °C. Membranes were washed twice for 20 min (each time) in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, twice for 20 min (each time) in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and once for 30 min in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS plus once for 30 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C. Autoradiographic exposures with two intensifying screens were carried out for 1–10 days at –80 °C. RT-PCR—The expression of TNFSF6 mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR using the primer oligonucleotides 5′, CAGCTCTTCCACCTACAGAAGG, and 3′, CATTGATCACAAGGCCACC, as described (52Collette Y. Razanajaona D. Ghiotto M. Olive D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3283-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR analysis of transiently transfected cells, poly(A) mRNA was purified using the MicroMax mRNA isolation kit according to the manufacturers' instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), except that a DNase I treatment step of the mRNA-loaded columns was added (30 units of DNase I at room temperature for 15 min). RT-PCR analysis was performed using the following primer pairs: luciferase, 5′, CTAGAGGATGGAACCGCTGGAGAGC; 3′, CGCAGGCAGTTCTATGCGGAAGGG; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′, GTCATCCCTGAGCTGAAC; 3′, GGGTCTTACTCCTTGGAG. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Soluble TNFSF6 concentrations present in culture supernatants were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit according to the manufacturers' instructions (Oncogene-Fas ligand ELISA catalog #QIA27). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and lysed in SDS sample loading buffer followed by 12% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. After transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), proteins were detected with the acetylhistone H4 antibody (06–866, Upstate Biotechnology) and enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturers' instructions (Westpico, Pierce). Bisulfite Cytosine Methylation Analysis—The samples of total genomic DNA (700 ng) isolated with the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen Inc.) and digested overnight with EcoRI in a volume of 20 μl were prepared for methylation analysis as described by Olek et al. (53Olek A. Oswald J. Walter J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 5064-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Briefly, the digested DNA boiled for 5 min, quickly chilled on ice, and incubated in 0.3 m NaOH at 50 °C for 15 min was mixed with 2.5 volumes of 2% LMP-agarose (SeaPlaque agarose, FMC). Ten-μl volumes of agarose/DNA mixture were pipetted into 750 μl of chilled mineral oil to form agarose beads. Aliquots of 1 ml of 2.5 m sodium metabisulfite (Sigma) and 125 mm hydroquinone (Sigma), pH 5.0, were then added to mineral oil containing up to 5 agarose beads. The reaction mixtures were kept on ice for 30 min and then incubated in the dark at 50 °C for 3.5 h. The agarose beads were equilibrated 4 times (15 min each) with 1 ml of Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, and DNA was desulfonated in 500 μl of 0.2 m NaOH (2 × 15 min) at room temperature. Finally, the beads were washed with 1 ml of Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0 (3 × 10 min), and kept at 4 °C. Bisulfite-treated DNA in melted agarose was amplified by PCR in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 1.75 mm MgCl2, 350 μm of each dNTP, and 45 pmol each of FAS15+, 5′-GTAGATTTTTTAAGAGTAGGATGAAGATAAATAGGTTT-3′ nucleotide (sense), and FAS18–, 5′-CTAACTAATAAAATACAACAAAAATAATAAA-3′, (antisense) primers complementary to TNFSF6 5′ regulatory region (Fig. 1A) with 1 unit of Taq polymerase. The amplification products were subjected to a second round of PCR with nested primers FAS16+, 5′-GGTTATTTTTTTTATTGATAATATAGATTTT-3′ (sense) and FAS17–, 5′-CTAAAAAAAACAAACTTCCTAATTATA-3′ (antisense). In some experiments the primer MD was replaced by the primer MF, 5′-AAATCTAAAAAATCTCTAATTACCAAAATC-3′ (nt 577–606, antisense), or the primer MR, 5′-ACTCCCAAACTCAAATCTAATCTAACCAAA (nt 461–490, antisense). The sense primers contained T, and the antisense primers contained A instead of C in positions complementary to nonmethylatable C (i.e. C out of CpG dinucleotides). PCR was performed with about 50 ng of genomic DNA (out of 140 ng of DNA per 1 agarose bead) for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Amplification products were cloned in the pGEM-Easy Vector System (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. Electroporation and Luciferase Assays—107 Jurkat T cells were electroporated at 960 microfarads and 250 V using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser with 25 μg of pGL2/basic or the various TNFSF6 promoter-driven luciferase firefly constructs together with 5 μg of thymidine kinase luciferase Renilla plasmid. The cells were incubated for 2 h, then left unstimulated or stimulated for 16 h as previously described (57Latinis K.M. Carr L.L. Peterson E.J. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4602-4611PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed to determine the luciferase activity by using the dual luciferase reporter assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) and read using a luminometer (Dynex). The transfection efficiency was normalized to luciferase Renilla activity and corrected for protein content as determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). DNase I Accessibility of the TNFSF6 5′ Regulatory Regions in TNFSF6-expressing Cells—The presence of DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HSS) in the 20-kilobase TNFSF6 5′ regulatory region was assessed by indirect end-labeling and southern blotting using a probe mapping 3′ to the TNFSF6 exon 2 (Fig. 1A). To identify regulatory elements associated with TNFSF6 gene active transcription, we compared DNase I hypersensitivity patterns in differentially expressing cells. In cells that do not actively transcribe TNFSF6 such as HeLa cells, (Fig. 1C), a closed chromatin structure was observed, as indicated by the lack of detectable DNase I-HSS over the analyzed region (Fig. 1B). Both unstimulated Jurkat and primary T lymphocytes displayed a similar closed chromatin structure even at high DNase I enzyme concentrations that correlated with the lack of TNFSF6 transcription and expression (Fig. 1, B–D). In contrast, a strong and specific HSS (called HSS1) appeared in a DNase I dose-dependent manner in both Jurkat and primary T lymphocytes stimulated by a combination of phorbol ester and calcium ionophore (P+I), a powerful mitogenic stimuli-inducing active transcription of TNFSF6 (Fig. 1B). The P+I-induced accessibility of HSS1 was further confirmed in numerous T cell lines (CEM, SupT1, and the JE6 and JA16 Jurkat T cell lines) and primary T lymphocytes obtained from different donors (data not show). Based on previous observations that NK cells constitutively express TNSF6 protein (54Kashii Y. Giorda R. Herberman R.B. Whiteside T.L. Vujanovic N.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5358-5366PubMed Google Scholar), we determined the presence of HSS1 in NK cell lines. HSS1 was detected in both the NKL and NK92 cell lines (Fig. 1B), in agreement with active TNFSF6 transcription and expression in these two cell lines (Fig. 1, C and D). Using the molecular weight markers, we mapped HSS1 between the BamH1 and BglII markers a region previously shown to mimic TNFSF6 gene transcriptional activity (Fig. 1A) (55Kavurma M.M. Khachigian L.M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Analysis of TNFSF6-HSS1 Chromatin Accessibility to Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) and Restriction Enzymes—We next sought to map TNFSF6-HSS1 more precisely and to determine the nucleosomal organization within the TNFSF6 5′ regulatory region. MNase preferentially digests nucleosome-free DNA and linker DNA and can, thus, be used to show nucleosome remodeling. Digestion of a nucleosomal array using limiting amounts of MNase will produce a ladder of DNA fragments corresponding to multiples of the nucleosome particle (∼160 bp). Nuclei were isolated from Jurkat cells and digested"
https://openalex.org/W1993596485,"Oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii proteolytically cleave the salivary PRP-1 polypeptide into an RGRPQ innate peptide. The Arg and Gln termini are crucial for RGRPQ-mediated ammonia production and proliferation by S. gordonii SK12 and adhesion inhibition and desorption by Actinomyces naeslundii T14V, respectively. Here we have applied (i) a multivariate approach using RGRPQ-related peptides varied at amino acids 2, 3, and 4 simultaneously and (ii) size and N- and C-terminal modifications of RGRPQ to generate structure activity information. While the N-terminal arginine motif mediated ammonia production independent of peptide size, other responses required more or less full-length peptide motifs. The motifs for adhesion inhibition and desorption were the same. The adhesion and proliferation motifs required similarily a hydrophobic/low polarity amino acid 4 but differentially a hydrophilic or hydrophobic character of amino acids 2/3, respectively; polar peptides with small/hydrophilic and hydrophilic amino acids 2 and 3, respectively, had high adhesion inhibition/desorption activity, and lipophilic peptides with large/hydrophobic amino acids 2 and 3 had high proliferation activity. Accordingly, while RIWWQ had increased proliferation but abolished adhesion/desorption activity, peptides designed with hydrophilic amino acids 2 and 3 were predicted to behave in the opposite way. Moreover, a RGRPQ mimetic for all three responses should mimic small hydrophilic, large nitrogen-containing, and hydrophobic/low polarity amino acids 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Peptides fulfilling these criteria were 1–1.6-fold improved in all three responses. Thus, both mimetics and peptides with differential proliferation and adhesion activities may be generated for evaluation in biofilm models. Oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii proteolytically cleave the salivary PRP-1 polypeptide into an RGRPQ innate peptide. The Arg and Gln termini are crucial for RGRPQ-mediated ammonia production and proliferation by S. gordonii SK12 and adhesion inhibition and desorption by Actinomyces naeslundii T14V, respectively. Here we have applied (i) a multivariate approach using RGRPQ-related peptides varied at amino acids 2, 3, and 4 simultaneously and (ii) size and N- and C-terminal modifications of RGRPQ to generate structure activity information. While the N-terminal arginine motif mediated ammonia production independent of peptide size, other responses required more or less full-length peptide motifs. The motifs for adhesion inhibition and desorption were the same. The adhesion and proliferation motifs required similarily a hydrophobic/low polarity amino acid 4 but differentially a hydrophilic or hydrophobic character of amino acids 2/3, respectively; polar peptides with small/hydrophilic and hydrophilic amino acids 2 and 3, respectively, had high adhesion inhibition/desorption activity, and lipophilic peptides with large/hydrophobic amino acids 2 and 3 had high proliferation activity. Accordingly, while RIWWQ had increased proliferation but abolished adhesion/desorption activity, peptides designed with hydrophilic amino acids 2 and 3 were predicted to behave in the opposite way. Moreover, a RGRPQ mimetic for all three responses should mimic small hydrophilic, large nitrogen-containing, and hydrophobic/low polarity amino acids 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Peptides fulfilling these criteria were 1–1.6-fold improved in all three responses. Thus, both mimetics and peptides with differential proliferation and adhesion activities may be generated for evaluation in biofilm models. Saliva confers infection resistance and wound healing to oral tissue surfaces (1Lamkin M.S. Oppenheim F.G. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol.

The saliva innate defense resides in general properties, such as clearance and pH, and specific innate (poly)peptide functions. These innate peptide functions control adhesion and colonization of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms as well as tissue homeostasis (1Lamkin M.S. Oppenheim F.G. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol.

These interactions occur through the C-terminal, proline-rich middle and phosporylated N-terminal domains, respectively (1Lamkin M.S. Oppenheim F.G. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). PRPs are subject to endogenous and bacterial proteolysis, generating a wide range of peptide derivatives in saliva (6Hay D.I.

Both allelic PRP variants and small size peptides derived thereof coincide with susceptibility or resistance to caries (11Ayad M. Van Wuyckhuyse B.C. Minaguchi K. Raubertas R.F. Bedi G.S.

The other acidic PRP variants (e.g. PRP-1 and PRP-2) coincide with resistance to caries and adhesion of commensal streptococci and actinomycetes (12Stenudd C. Nordlund Å. Ryberg M. Johansson I. KällestÅl C. Strömberg N. J. Dent. Res. 2001; 80: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, commensal Streptococcus gordonii SK12 proteolytically cleave PRP-1 into a multipotent RGRPQ peptide that regulates plaque pH in situ, stimulates proliferation of the same organism, and inhibits adhesion of Actinomyces naeslundii T14V, which competes for acidic PRP binding sites (10Li T.

Strömberg N. Bacterial Adhesion and Innate Immunity in Oral Biofilm Formation. UmeÅ University, UmeÅ, Sweden2001Google Scholar). The effect on plaque pH by RGRPQ resides in inhibition of bacterial acid production from sucrose and catabolism of arginine to ammonia. The RGRPQ peptide could, similar to the ERGMT and ARNQT peptide signals that affect intra- or extracellular receptors and gene expression in Bacillus subtilis (14Lazazzera B.A. Grossman A.D. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 288-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), mimic natural peptide signaling substances in the streptococcal biofilm. In S. gordonii challis, genes encoding peptide pheromone receptors are present (15Havarstein L.S. Gaustad P. Nes I.F. Morrison D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We have shown that the Arg and Gln termini of the RGRPQ peptide are crucially, though differentially, linked to the various innate responses by systematically replacing one amino acid after another with alanine and comparing the activities of designed and wild type peptides (13Li T. Lohilahti M. Kilian M. Strömberg N. Bacterial Adhesion and Innate Immunity in Oral Biofilm Formation. UmeÅ University, UmeÅ, Sweden2001Google Scholar). Such alanine, proline, or serine scans represent simple and easy strategies to uncover structure-activity relationships. A more powerful approach is to use statistical molecular design (SMD), an experimental design approach (16Linusson A. Wold S. Norden B. Mol. Divers. 1999; 4: 103-114Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Linusson A. Gottfries J. Lindgren F. Wold S. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), in combination with quantitative structure activity-relationship (QSAR) analyses based on quantitative amino acid descriptors (18Dunn III, W.J. Chemom. Intell. Lab. Syst. 1989; 6: 181-190Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19Eriksson L. Johansson E. Chemom. Intell. Lab. Syst. 1996; 34: 1-19Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). QSARs are modeled using multivariate data analysis techniques, such as partial least squares projection to latent structures (PLS) (20Wold S. Geladi P. Esbensen K. Öhman J. J. Chemom. 1987; 1: 41-56Crossref Google Scholar, 21Höskuldsson A. J. Chemom. 1995; 9: 91-123Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In SMD and QSAR, several amino acid positions are varied simultaneously. The SMD and QSAR approach reveals both amino acid properties and interactions between amino acids pertinent to activity and, consequently, forms a platform for the generation of peptide mimetics. This approach has, for example, been used to develop mimetics that inhibits pili assembly and urinary tract infections based on the interaction of pili chaperones with peptides from the cell surface pilus subunit of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (22Larsson A. Johansson S.M. Pinkner J.S. Hultgren S.J. Almqvist F. Kihlberg J. Linusson A. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Emtenas H. Ahlin K. Pinkner J.S. Hultgren S.J. Almqvist F. J. Comb. Chem. 2002; 4: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to apply (i) SMD and PLS to establish QSARs for a set of RGRPQ-related peptides varied at amino acids 2–4 simultaneously and (ii) size and N- and C-terminal modifications of RGRPQ to generate structure activity information. The results were used to design new peptides with differential adhesion inhibition/desorption and proliferation activities. Moreover, this SMD approach extracted which properties in the various positions in the peptides that controlled the various biological responses. The results therefore constitute a solid platform for extended studies toward novel peptidomimetics. Peptides—Peptides were synthesized, purified using high performance liquid chromatography, and characterized by mass spectrometry (Thermo Electron GmbH, Ulm, Germany). Peptides were dissolved in sterile water, adjusted to pH 6.8–7.0, and frozen as aliquots at –20 °C prior to the experiments. All peptides were fully soluble at the concentrations used for the biological assays. SMD—SMD (16Linusson A. Wold S. Norden B. Mol. Divers. 1999; 4: 103-114Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Linusson A. Gottfries J. Lindgren F. Wold S. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) is an approach for selection of subsets of compounds from large virtual compound libraries. It can, for instance, be used to select well balanced compound sets and thereby reducing the number of compounds required for establishing QSARs. An initial step in SMD and QSAR is to quantitatively describe the compounds, i.e. peptide sequences, with molecular descriptors. Here the z-scales for hydrophilizity (z1), size (z2), and electronic effects (z3) were used to quantitatively describe the separate amino acids in the sequence (26Hellberg S. Sjöström M. Skagerberg B. Wold S. J. Med. Chem. 1987; 30: 1126-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In addition, lipophilicity (SlogP) and total polar surface area (TPSA) (26Hellberg S. Sjöström M. Skagerberg B. Wold S. J. Med. Chem. 1987; 30: 1126-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) were calculated in MOE (27Chemical Computing Group Inc. (2002) MOE Software, 2002.03 Ed., MontrealGoogle Scholar), for the entire peptide, resulting in a so-called descriptor matrix with 11 variables for each peptide sequence (Fig. 1). In this work, a D-optimal design (28deAguiar P.F. Bourguignon B. Khots M.S. Massart D.L. PhanThanLuu R. Chemom. Intell. Lab. Syst. 1995; 30: 199-210Crossref Scopus (310) Google Scholar) was used to select a set of 14 diverse peptides for QSAR modeling. While amino acids 2–4 of the RGRPQ peptide were varied simultaneously using all 20 natural amino acids in the candidate set used for SMD, the functionally crucial Arg and Gln were kept constant. This resulted in a candidate set of 203, or 8,000, RXXXQ peptides. The candidate set was reduced to 7,600 peptides by exclusion of the most distant or extreme five percent of the peptides, as estimated by their distances to the RGHPQ center point of the SMD. A test set of 14 peptides, including the center point RGHPQ peptide, was then selected from the descriptor matrix using D-optimal design (28deAguiar P.F. Bourguignon B. Khots M.S. Massart D.L. PhanThanLuu R. Chemom. Intell. Lab. Syst. 1995; 30: 199-210Crossref Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 29Dumouchel W. Jones B. Technometrics. 1994; 36: 37-47Google Scholar) as implemented in MODDE 6.0 (30Umetrics MODDE 6.0 Software.7.0 Ed. Umetrics, UmeÅ, Sweden2001Google Scholar). Hence, a diverse selection of peptides covering a representative range of each z-scale was made. The RGHPQ center point peptide was the peptide closest to a calculated middle point between the highly active RGRPQ and RGAPQ peptides (13Li T. Lohilahti M. Kilian M. Strömberg N. Bacterial Adhesion and Innate Immunity in Oral Biofilm Formation. UmeÅ University, UmeÅ, Sweden2001Google Scholar). Earlier tested peptides were added as inclusions in the D-optimal design, and RGRPQ was added and used as a reference. QSAR Modeling—The method of PLS was used to calculate the QSAR model for the 14 test peptides and three biological responses (SIMCA-p + 10.0) (31Umetrics SIMCA-p + 10.0 Software.10.0.2.0 Ed. Umetrics, UmeÅ, Sweden2002Google Scholar). The PLS method identifies the information in X (amino acid properties) that relates to the variation in Y (biological responses), i.e. the amino acid properties that result in a change in response. R2 and Q2 are used to diagnose the model. R2 is a measure of how much of the variation in Y that is explained by the model, and Q2 is a measure of the cross-validated predictive ability of the model. R2 and Q2 values can also be generated for each separate response in the model. The QSAR model was used to predict the biological activity for the remaining 7,585 pentapeptides in the candidate set not selected by the D-optimal design. Six of these peptides were tested to verify the reliability of the QSAR-model, i.e. external validation of the model. Bacterial Strains—S. gordonii SK12 and A. naeslundii T14V (8Li T. Khah M.K. Slavnic S. Johansson I. Strömberg N. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7224-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Kilian M. Mikkelsen L. Henrichsen J. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1989; 39: 471-484Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar) were grown overnight on Columbia-II-agar base plates (BD Biosciences), supplemented with 30 ml of a human erythrocyte suspension per liter, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The strains intended for adhesion inhibition tests were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (8Li T. Khah M.K. Slavnic S. Johansson I. Strömberg N. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7224-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Growth-inducing Capacity (Proliferation)—The ability of RGRPQ-related peptides to induce growth of S. gordonii strain SK12 (referred to as proliferation) was measured by culturing SK12 in a minimum growth medium supplemented with peptide. The minimum growth medium, generated by dilution eight times of a chemically defined medium (free amino acid pool; Ref. 33Terleckyj B. Willett N.P. Shockman G.D. Infect. Immun. 1975; 11: 649-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were filter-sterilized (Millipore) and aliquoted (100 μl/well) into a 96-well microtiter plate. Prior to inoculation of strain SK12 to the minimum growth medium, SK12 was cultured twice and consecutively in chemically defined medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The second culture was grown for 14 h and used as an inoculum (1%, 1/100 μl) to the minimum growth medium supplemented with 150 μm peptide (peptide/free amino acid pool ratio was 1:20). The effect by RGRPQ on growth was dose-dependent between 25 and 250 μm peptide, and 150 μm RGRPQ increased the regeneration time from 4.35 to 1.85 h. The inoculated wells were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Bacterial cell numbers were established by recording the absorbance at 550 nm using a SpectraMAX 340 spectrometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) before and during culturing. Absorbance values within the range of the assay were linearly proportional to the bacterial cell concentration, as established by correlating the absorbance values and bacterial cell numbers obtained from counting of cells on agar plates. Adhesion Inhibition—Inhibition of adhesion of A. naeslundii T14V to PRP-1 was performed by preincubation of cells with peptides (final concentration of 10 mm) for 20 min at room temperature prior to adhesion tests. The adhesion test of 35S-labeled A. naeslundii T14V to PRP-1 coated onto hydroxyapatite beads was performed essentially as described (8 mg of beads, 5 × 108 cells/ml and 1-h adhesion) (8Li T. Khah M.K. Slavnic S. Johansson I. Strömberg N. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7224-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Reversal of Aggregates of Bacteria and PRP-1-coated Beads (Desorption)—The ability of RGRPQ-related peptides to reverse aggregates between A. naeslundii T14V and PRP-1-coated latex beads (referred to as desorption) was measured by adding peptides to preformed aggregates. Aggregates of A. naeslundii T14V and PRP-1-coated latex beads were formed as described (10Li T. Bratt P. Jonsson A.P. Ryberg M. Johansson I. Griffiths W.J. Bergman T. Strömberg N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5425-5429Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), except for the use of 6 × 109 cells/ml of bacterial suspension. Bovine serum albumin-coated latex beads served as a control and did not induce aggregates. Untreated control strain T14V induced strong aggregation (i.e. clumping of aggregates in clear solution, score 0 below) of bacteria and PRP-1-latex beads. Aggregates were reversed by adding peptide at a total concentration of 5.06 mm, and the degree of desorption was related to the T14V control (without peptide) and visually scored from 0 to 5 (no, weak, moderate, strong, very strong, and complete desorption, respectively) based on the following criteria: 0, clumping of aggregates in clear solution; 1, large aggregates in clear solution; 2, moderate aggregates in clear solution; 3, moderate aggregates in unclear solution; 4, small aggregates in unclear solution; and 5, no visible aggregates. Ammonia Production—An overnight culture of S. gordonii SK12 was washed once in 10 ml sterile water, adjusted to 4.8 × 109 cells/ml with water, and kept on ice for a minimum of 30 min before use (34Wijeyeweera R.L. Kleinberg I. Arch. Oral Biol. 1989; 34: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Bacterial cells (90 μl) were mixed with test peptide, and sterile water was added to give a final volume of 100 μl at a final peptide concentration of 0.5 mm. The mixture and control cell suspension were incubated at 37 °C aerobically, and pH was measured using a pH-electrode. QSARs of RGRPQ-related Peptides for Three Biological Responses—The PLS method was used to generate a QSAR model from a set of 14 RGRPQ-related peptides varied at amino acids 2–4 simultaneously and their proliferation, adhesion inhibition, or desorption activities (Figs. 1 and 2). The 14 diverse, and for the quantitative properties representative, designed test peptides are shown in Fig. 3A. The PLS (QSAR) model (R2 = 89%, Q2 = 69%) showed the relationship of single (linear terms) or interacting (interaction terms) amino acid properties of the peptides with the three biological responses (Fig. 2). Molecular structures and a schematic representation of the structure activity relationships are given in Figs. 4 and 5.FIGURE 3A, PLS score plot showing the predicted activity of six peptides (▴ and encircled), selected for verification of the model, when the activity of the 7,600 candidate peptides (data not shown), including the 14 test peptides and the RGRPQ reference peptide (▪ or •, circled peptides are selected for illustration of proliferation in Fig. 1B), were predicted using the PLS (QSAR) model. The direction of the arrowheads indicate positions of peptides (when projected down to the dotted line) with increasing proliferation (upper arrowhead) or adhesion inhibition/desorption (lower arrowhead) activity, respectively. The axes in the PLS score plot show the predicted positions of peptides in the first (tPS1) and second (tPS2) score dimensions. B, effect of the six selected peptides used for verification of the model on proliferation, adhesion inhibition, and desorption. Two of the peptides selected for high proliferation activity (RPWCQ and RWWHQ) and two selected for high adhesion inhibition/desorption activity (RGRCQ and RGWAQ) displayed improved activity compared with RGRPQ and the corresponding responses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Molecular structures of peptides with high or low proliferation or adhesion inhibition/desorption activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5A, molecular structures and schematic illustration of amino acid properties of peptides with differential proliferation versus adhesion inhibition/desorption activity.

Note that the schematically depicted properties refer to the amino acid rather than to its R-group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The R2 and Q2 for the separate responses showed similar values, leading to the conclusion that they were all explained well by the model: proliferation (R2 = 92%, Q2 = 71%), adhesion inhibition (R2 = 86%, Q2 = 69%) and desorption (R2 = 87%, Q2 = 60%). Amino Acid and RGRPQ Characteristics Influencing Proliferation Activity—The proliferation response depended on similar properties as for adhesion inhibition/desorption for amino acid 4 but different properties for amino acids 2 and 3 (Fig. 2). The following properties of amino acids 2–4 or the overall peptide correlated with a high proliferation activity (Fig. 2A): (i) large (z2) and hydrophobic (z1) amino acids 2 and 3 as illustrated by the potent RWWCQ and RIWWQ peptides with hydrophobic tryptophan (Trp) or isoleucine (Ile) groups at these positions, (ii) a hydrophobic and low polarity of amino acid 4 (z3-4) (e.g. cysteine), and (iii) a high overall peptide lipophilicity, SlogP, as illustrated by the low potency of the RKKKQ peptide with a charged residue in all three positions. Some amino acid or peptide properties interacted (i.e. interaction terms) with a large size of amino acid 3 (z2-3) to generate a high proliferation activity (Fig. 2A): (i) a high peptide lipophilicity (SlogP*z2-3), (ii) high hydrophobicity for amino acid 3 (z1-3*z2-3), and (iii) low polarity of amino acid 4 (z2-3*z3-4). The strength of these interactions and the highly influential and linear dependence on hydrophobic properties of amino acid 3 (z1-3) emphasizes the primary importance of a large and hydrophobic amino acid 3 that largely guides the properties of amino acids 2 and 4 (e.g. if increasing the size of amino acid 3 above a threshold level, the size of amino acid 4 should be diminished to retain high activity). Some peptides mediated 1–1.6-fold increased proliferation (e.g. RWWCQ and RIWWQ) compared with RGRPQ, while others (e.g. RKKKQ or RDDDQ) displayed reduced but still some proliferation activity (Fig. 1). Virtually Identical RGRPQ Properties Determine Adhesion Inhibition and Desorption Activity—The PLS (QSAR) model showed adhesion inhibition and desorption to depend on virtually identical amino acid properties (Fig. 2, B and C), as illustrated by RGHPQ and RGRPQ showing high adhesion inhibition and desorption activities, while other peptides were less potent for both responses. The following amino acid properties coincided accordingly with both a high adhesion inhibition and desorption activity (Fig. 2, B and C): (i) a hydrophobicity and low polarity of amino acid 4, (ii) a large size and hydrophilicity of amino acid 3, as illustrated by the potent RGRPQ and RGHPQ peptides with a bulky and nitrogen-containing arginine (Arg) or histidine (His), and (iii) hydrophilicity and small size of amino acid 2, as illustrated for the potent RGRPQ and RGHPQ peptides with a glycine at this position. Substitution of glycine with sterically demanding or charged residues as for RIWWQ and RDDDQ, respectively, abolished accordingly the activity. Some amino acid or peptide properties interacted (i.e. interaction terms) with a small size of amino acid 2 (z2-2) to generate a high adhesion inhibition or desorption activity (Fig. 2, B and C): a hydrophilic amino acid 3 (z2-2*z1-3) and amino acid 2 (z1-2*z2-2) and high total polar surface area (TPSA*z2-2). Accordingly, the positive z1-2*z2-2 terms for both adhesion inhibition/desorption and proliferation, which show inversed correlations for the corresponding linear properties, emphasize that size and hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of amino acid 2 affects the two responses differently. Similarly, while a hydrophilic character of amino acid 3 (TPSA*z1-3) correlates with a high adhesion/desorption activity, high proliferation activity depends on a large and hydrophobic character of the same amino acid (SlogP*z2-3 and z1-3*z2-3). Thus, peptides with differential proliferation and adhesion inhibition activities can be designed. Peptides Designed from the QSAR Model Behaved as Expected—To verify the QSAR model and delineated structure-activity relationships, we tested the activity of six peptides predicted to have either a high proliferation or adhesion inhibition activity (Fig. 3, A and B). The RPWCQ and RWWHQ peptides mediated as predicted high proliferation but not adhesion inhibition/desorption and contained a large hydrophobic proline (Pro) or tryptophan (Trp) in position 2, tryptophan in position 3, and low polarity cysteine or histidine (His) in position 4, respectively. The RGWAQ and RGRCQ peptide, on the other hand, showed as predicted a high adhesion inhibition and desorption activity and, accordingly, contained a small glycine (Gly) in position 2, a large nitrogen containing tryptophan (Trp), or arginine (Arg) in position 3 and a low polarity alanine (Ala) or cysteine (Cys) at position 4 (see Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, peptides with differential proliferation and adhesion inhibition/desorption activities were found. In addition, the RGRCQ and RGWAQ verification peptides and RGHPQ test peptide were improved in all three responses as compared with RGRPQ (Fig. 3B and supplemental Table 1). The three peptides are characterized by (i) a small amino acid 2 (Gly), (ii) a large, hydrophobic and nitrogen-containing amino acid 3 (Trp), and (iii) a hydrophobic (Ala) or low polarity (Cys) amino acid 4 (Fig. 5). Effects of N- and C-terminal and Size Modifications of RGRPQ on Its Innate Properties—We next used N- and C-terminal and size modifications of the RGRPQ peptide to further explore peptide characteristics essential to the RGRPQ innate properties (Table 1).TABLE 1Effect of N- and C-terminal and size modifications of RGRPQ on its innate propertiesPeptideaCH3CO means N-terminal acetylation, and CONH2 means C-terminal amidation.S. gordonii SK12A. naeslundii T14VProliferation increasebPercentage increase of cell numbers (A550) when culturing SK12 for 15 h in a minimum growth medium supplemented with peptide.

Open table in a new tab Adhesion inhibition and desorption resided largely in the GRPQ sequence, since both PQ and RPQ lacked inhibitory activity and since the N-terminal Arg marginally increased the activity of the RGRPQ peptide. Moreover, the unmodified RGRPQ peptide was more active than the C- or N-terminally modified peptides, although the C-terminal amidation of Gln, which removes its negative charge, reduced the activity more profoundly than the N-terminal acetylation. Stimulation of proliferation resided more or less in the full-length RGRPQ sequence, since PQ lacked activity, and since high but somewhat increasing activity occurred in the order of RGRPQ > GRPQ > RPQ. The RPQ tripeptide had markedly high proliferation activity compared with its low adhesion activity. Both C- and N-terminal modifications of RGRPQ reduced the proliferation activity dramatically. Moreover, di- or tri-repetitive RGRPQ peptides (RGRPQ2 and RGRPQ3) were as potent stimulators as the RGRPQ peptide. Ammonia production occurred rather independently of size. The RG and AGR peptides and the di- or tri-repetitive RGRPQ peptides (RGRPQ2 and RGRPQ3) showed activities rather similar to full-length RGRPQ. Moreover, ammonia production occurred rather independently of an N- or C-terminal location of the Arg residue. Finally, while the activity was completely blocked by acetylation of the N-terminal Arg residue, amidation of the C terminus of RGRPQ did not affect activity. This study shows that multivariate design and evaluation of small sized RGRPQ-related peptides generates valuable information on amino acid properties essential for its activity and for the generation of peptide mimetics or mimetic building blocks. The RGRPQ peptide is challenging for mimetic development as it affects proliferation, adhesion, and local pH, which all are key components in biofilm formation and should be retained by a peptidomimetic. An RGRPQ mimetic platform for all three responses should mimic a small hydrophilic, a large nitrogen-containing (potentially involved in H-bonding), and a hydrophobic/low polarity amino acids 2, 3, and 4, respectively, as well as arginine (Arg) and glutamine (Gln) at positions 1 and 5 (Fig. 5). The RGHPQ, RGRCQ, and RGWAQ peptides, which fulfilled these criteria, showed slightly enhanced activities for proliferation and adhesion inhibition/desorption. Moreover, the specific mimetic platforms for inhibition/desorption and proliferation are similar for amino acids 4 and 5, while different for amino acids 2 and 3 (Fig. 5). The QSAR model from the small panel of designed peptides allowed accordingly a large volume of information, and to our delight, peptides predicted from the model showed the expected activity. An even larger set of peptides with systematic variations at amino acids 1–5 would, consequently, provide an even better guidance to the generation of RGRPQ mimetics to control microbial ecology and disease development. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the RGRPQ peptide supports oral colonization of S. gordonii SK12 in rats in vivo (13Li T. Lohilahti M. Kilian M. Strömberg N. Bacterial Adhesion and Innate Immunity in Oral Biofilm Formation. UmeÅ University, UmeÅ, Sweden2001Google Scholar), potentially by inducing a more rapidly growing bacterial phenotype (14Lazazzera B.A. Grossman A.D. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 288-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The present results suggest a blend of complex and simple peptide motifs for proliferation, adhesion inhibition, and ammonia production. The complex, though differential, peptide motifs for proliferation and adhesion inhibition/desorption involved more or less the full-length RGRPQ peptide. A high proliferation activity is mediated by RGRPQ, GRPQ, and RPQ (RGRPQ and GRPQ > RPQ) and peptides with unmodified glutamine (Gln), large and hydrophobic properties of amino acids 2 and 3, and hydrophobic and low polarity properties of amino acid 4 (Fig. 5). The importance of a high overall peptide lipophilicity, largely involving amino acid 3, may relate to uptake of the peptide at the cellular membrane or to the character of intra or extra cellular receptors. Moreover, a high adhesion inhibition/desorption activity is mediated by GRPQ with an unmodified Gln terminus, a small amino acid at position 2 (Gly) and a hydrophobic/low polarity (Pro or Cys) amino acid at position 4. Position 3, on the other hand, allowed a variety of substituents but should favorable be slightly hydrophilic (Fig. 5). The PQ and RPQ peptides lacked inhibitory activity and conformational features of glycine at position 2, potentially guiding a cis or trans configuration of proline (Pro), may accordingly contribute to the high GRPQ activity. The virtually identical requirements for adhesion inhibition and desorption are consistent with two related phenomena but surprising, since they are surface versus solution reactions, respectively. Bacterial desorption or release of multiple fimbriae-receptor interactions may, however, follow solution kinetics in general or reflect the aggregation assay used, as opposed to irreversible protein ligand interactions at surfaces, e.g. antibody-antigen surface reactions (24Stenberg M. Nygren H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 113: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Finally, ammonia production required only a simple arginine (Arg) motif independent of peptide size or N- and C-terminal localization. It is possible that arginine protrudes from the rest of the RGRPQ peptide, which largely accounts for proliferation and adhesion inhibition/desorption (i.e. GRPQ), and that the arginine deaminease (involved in the catabolism of arginine to ammonia by bacteria) recognizes the protruding arginine (Fig. 5). Adhesion and proliferation of microorganisms and local conditions, such as pH, are key factors in biofilm formation (25O'Toole G. Kaplan H.B. Kolter R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). In oral biofilm formation, frequent intakes of sugar induce acid production from bacteria and a pH decrease changing the biofilm ecology and its potential to cause caries. It is certainly interesting that the RGRPQ peptide is capable of affecting adhesion, proliferation, and pH and that the present findings show the possibility of designing peptides that affects these properties selectively. While RIWWQ increased proliferation but lacked adhesion inhibition/desorption activity, the QSAR model predicts peptides with even larger differences and with the opposite behaviors. While a hydrophobic amino acid 3 and peptide character promotes proliferation selectively, a hydrophilic amino acid 3 and peptide character promotes adhesion inhibition selectively (Fig. 5). There has been a long standing question of whether compounds affecting proliferation versus adhesion are more effective in controlling biofilm formation and infectious diseases in vivo. This study enlightens the possibility to design RGRPQ derivatives with differential adhesion and proliferation activities for evaluation in biofilm models. In conclusion, this study has drug development implications and provides an example of statistical molecular design as a platform to extract important structure activity relationships from peptides with a multitude of biological properties.
