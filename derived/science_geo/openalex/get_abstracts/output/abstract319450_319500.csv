https://openalex.org/W1999097138,"A criterion is suggested for discrimination between ferromanganese oxide minerals, deposited after the introduction of manganese and associated elements in sea water solution at submarine vulcanism, and minerals which are slowly formed from dilute solution, largely of continental origin. The simlultaneous injection of thorium into the ocean by submarine vulcanism is indicated, and its differentiation from continental thorium introduced into the ocean by runoff is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1996220523,"The disaccharide trehalose is the main carbohydrate constituent in the hemolymph of the house cricket, Gryllus domesticus L. At different times of day the blood sugar in the hemolymph of crickets showed a fluctuation in trehalose concentration, which reached a peak value about 3 hours before dawn."
https://openalex.org/W1966746786,"Transport of calcium-45 in 20-mm root segments is basipetal and requires metabolic maintenance. Such transport reaches a maximum rate after immersion of the roots in tracer solution for approximately 12 hours and is still pronounced after 50 hours. Acropetal movement is slight, probably non-metabolic, and essentially constant. Amounts transported are linearly dependent on the absorbing area exposed to tracer solution."

https://openalex.org/W2069037308,"Microscopic investigation of drops of brine evaporating in air revealed crystal forms of sodium chloride other than the cube, when cysteine, creatinine, papain, monosodium glutamate, sodium hexametaphosphate, a combination of sodium hexametaphosphate and aluminum salt, or aluminon were added to the brine in small amounts. Some of these have a definite effect in parts per million concentration."

https://openalex.org/W1994484505,"When an insulator, sandwiched between metals of dissimilar work functions, is irradiated with x-radiation, a voltage related to the contact potential difference of the metals is observed. This phenomenon, known as the bulk photovoltaic effect, has been demonstrated in a variety of metal-insulator-metal combinations. Evidence that the voltage is not generated by junctions, barrier layers, or similar other phenomena is presented."
