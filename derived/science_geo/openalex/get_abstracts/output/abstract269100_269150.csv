https://openalex.org/W2013945133,"Two male and two female chimpanzees were each taught ten signs of American Sign Language. The acquisition rates of the signs were compared on the basis of the number of minutes required in training to reach a criterion of five consecutive unprompted correct responses. After the ten signs had been acquired, the chimpanzees were tested in a double-blind procedure for nine of the signs. All four chimpanzees acquired all of the signs. Some signs were consistently easier to acquire than others, and individual differences between the four chimpanzees were found in the acquisition rates and tests."

Dust storms on earth become electrified, with accompanying breakdown phenomena. Martian dust storms may reduce the atmospheric conductivity by capturing fast ions on particles, and, by electrifying, may cause discharges in the relatively low pressure atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W1995736772,"Algal bioassays were used to demonstrate the high efficiency of a comnbined tertiary wastewater treatment and marine aquaculture system in removing inorganic nitrogen, and to show that the coastal waters off Woods Hole, Massachusetts, are limited in nitrogen for marine phytoplankton growth. When nutrients were removed from secondarily treated domestic wastewater through assimilation by phytoplankton in an outdoor growth pond, the pond effluent, in varying dilutions with seawater, could not support more phytoplankton growth than the seawater alone. However, when nitrogen was added back to the mixtures of pond effluent and seawater, the phytoplankton growth response was similar to that with a mixture of wastewater and seawater. This is similar to the findings of other researchers, and suggests that nitrogen may be the key growth-limiting nutrient in many coastal marine waters. The combined tertiary treatment-marine aquaculture system appears to be an effective means of removing nitrogen from secondarily treated wastewater and controlling eutrophication of coastal marine waters."

The lists were 10, 20, and 40 pictures in length. Recall failed to show the primacy and recency effects seen with verbal materials, but was lower for pictures in longer lists. This argues for serial-position effects based in short-term memory and independent list-length effects arising during retrieval from long-term memory."
https://openalex.org/W2054270707,An unusually well-preserved Ordovician fossil from Czechoslovakia shows that the enigmatic paired structures once thought to be outgrowths of the operculum of Hyolithes are really independent structures lying between the operculum and the aperture of the shell. The find seems to provide conclusive proof of the morphologic uniqueness of hyolithids.
https://openalex.org/W1994133093,"Surface meteorological observations and salinity and temperature profiles were made in the intertropical convergence zone during July 1972. Over an 18-hour period, estimates of the heat budget in the top layer of the ocean and estimates of the total heat flux made by using aerodynamic parameterization equations balance within 10 percent. The salinity budget provides a precipitation estimate. Due to the stable stratification established by the salinity dilution in the wave-mixed layer by rain, the total heat flux to the atmosphere is being extracted from this shallow layer. As a result, large sea surface temperature drops occur regionally and may be capable of inhibiting atmospheric convection."
https://openalex.org/W2082111697,"Analogs of the purines, adenine and guanine, and of the pyrimidines, cytosine and uracil, completely inhibited two-dimensional differentiation in the gametophytes of the fern, Asplenium nidus L. Analogs of thymine caused a nonspecific growth inhibition without suppressing two-dimensional growth. The effects of the analogs were reversed by the respective bases or their derivatives."

https://openalex.org/W2092695662,"Laser microbeam studies reveal that postembryonic development of the free-living nematode Panagrellus silusiae is under the control of specific regions. Growth is regulated by the hindgut, and ecdysis by nerve cell bodies situated anterior to the nerve ring, and gonad development is under the control of the nerve ring. This latter event is presumably neuronally mediated, while the other events are under hormonal control."
https://openalex.org/W2045186070,"The polonium-210 activity of the lunar surface is significantly larger than the activity of its progenitor radon-222. This result establishes unequivocally that radon emanation from the present-day moon varies considerably within the 21-year half-life of lead-210, the parent nuclide of polonium-210. There are large variations and well-localized enhancements in polonium-210 activity over much of the moon's surface."

https://openalex.org/W2075847246,A helium-neon gas laser has been successfully used in conjunction with an automatic fringe-counting interferometer to measure the length of a meter bar. The agreement obtained was 7 parts in 100 million with respect to the assigned length of the bar.

https://openalex.org/W2060240256,"The American nation is in process of assuming, through the power of her military, naval, and air forces, and the technological organization requisite to that power, a position of major responsibility for peace and civilization in the post-war era. Adequately to meet the commitments which such a responsibility entails, the United States will, of necessity, be forced to enlarge both political and social horizons and at the same time to develop, to a degree hitherto unrealized, the scientific bases which that enhanced influence in the counsels of the world will, in large measure, require. The progress of science and the technological changes that have resulted therefrom have proceeded with auto-accelerating pace over the last thirty years. Some concept of what the coming decades may hold can be learned from the history of this country during World War I and the interwar years with respect to scientific achievement, and the pattern there revealed will be a miniature of what must inevitably follow from the revolutionary changes in technology that the present war has produced. In 1914 American science looked to Europe for leadership. As Dr. C. M. Stine noted in an address to American chemists one year ago:"
