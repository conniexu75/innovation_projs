Analysis of these data reveals that, contrary to previous literature, the world population is unlikely to stop growing this century. There is an 80% probability that world population, now 7.2 billion people, will increase to between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion in 2100. This uncertainty is much smaller than the range from the traditional UN high and low variants. Much of the increase is expected to happen in Africa, in part due to higher fertility rates and a recent slowdown in the pace of fertility decline. Also, the ratio of working-age people to older people is likely to decline substantially in all countries, even those that currently have young populations."
https://openalex.org/W2108371618,"Spatial and temporal dissection of the genomic changes occurring during the evolution of human non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may help elucidate the basis for its dismal prognosis. We sequenced 25 spatially distinct regions from seven operable NSCLCs and found evidence of branched evolution, with driver mutations arising before and after subclonal diversification. There was pronounced intratumor heterogeneity in copy number alterations, translocations, and mutations associated with APOBEC cytidine deaminase activity. Despite maintained carcinogen exposure, tumors from smokers showed a relative decrease in smoking-related mutations over time, accompanied by an increase in APOBEC-associated mutations. In tumors from former smokers, genome-doubling occurred within a smoking-signature context before subclonal diversification, which suggested that a long period of tumor latency had preceded clinical detection. The regionally separated driver mutations, coupled with the relentless and heterogeneous nature of the genome instability processes, are likely to confound treatment success in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2036785515,"Neurogenesis is restricted in the adult mammalian brain; most neurons are neither exchanged during normal life nor replaced in pathological situations. We report that stroke elicits a latent neurogenic program in striatal astrocytes in mice. Notch1 signaling is reduced in astrocytes after stroke, and attenuated Notch1 signaling is necessary for neurogenesis by striatal astrocytes. Blocking Notch signaling triggers astrocytes in the striatum and the medial cortex to enter a neurogenic program, even in the absence of stroke, resulting in 850 ± 210 (mean ± SEM) new neurons in a mouse striatum. Thus, under Notch signaling regulation, astrocytes in the adult mouse brain parenchyma carry a latent neurogenic program that may potentially be useful for neuronal replacement strategies."

Understanding the thermal structures and appearances of these planets requires investigating how their atmospheres respond to such extreme stellar forcing. We present spectroscopic thermal emission measurements as a function of orbital phase (“phase-curve observations”) for the highly irradiated exoplanet WASP-43b spanning three full planet rotations using the Hubble Space Telescope. With these data, we construct a map of the planet’s atmospheric thermal structure, from which we find large day-night temperature variations at all measured altitudes and a monotonically decreasing temperature with pressure at all longitudes.

https://openalex.org/W2117501673,"Introduction The ability to manufacture inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) with arbitrarily prescribed three-dimensional (3D) shapes and positional surface modifications is essential to enabling diverse applications (e.g., in nano-optics and biosensing). However, it is challenging to achieve 3D arbitrary user-specified shapes with sub–5-nm resolution. Top-down lithography has limited resolution, particularly for 3D shapes; capping ligands can be used to tune the energy difference of selected crystallographic facets, but typically only for highly symmetric shapes with identical surface facets. Rationale We developed a framework to program arbitrary 3D inorganic NPs using DNA, which serves both as an informational “genome” to encode the 3D shape of a NP and as a physical “fabricator” to retrieve the information and execute the instruction to manufacture the NP. Specifically, our method uses a computationally designed, mechanically stiff synthetic DNA nanostructure with a user-specified cavity as a “mold” to cast the target inorganic NP. The mold encloses a small gold (Au) “seed.” Under mild conditions, the Au seed grows into a larger metal NP that fills the entire cavity, thereby replicating its prescribed 3D shape. The remaining DNA mold additionally acts as a spatially programmable functionalization surface. Results Using this DNA nanocasting method, we constructed three distinct sub–25-nm 3D cuboid silver (Ag) NPs with three independently tunable dimensions. The shape versatility of DNA-based nanocasting was further demonstrated via the synthesis of Ag NPs with equilateral triangular, right triangular, and circular cross sections. The material versatility was demonstrated via synthesis of a Au cuboid in addition to the Ag NPs. The DNA mold served as an addressable coating for the casted NP and thus enabled the construction of higher-order composite structures, including a Y-shaped Ag NP composite and a quantum dot (QD)–Ag-QD sandwiched structure through one-step casting growth. We investigated the key design parameters for stiff DNA molds through mechanical simulations. Multilayered DNA molds provided higher mechanical stiffness for confining NP growth within the mold than single-layer DNA molds, as confirmed by experimental observation. We additionally characterized plasmonic properties of the designer equilateral Ag triangle and Ag sphere through electron energy loss spectroscopy. Tuning of particle symmetry produced a shape-specific spectrum, which is consistent with the predictions of electromagnetism-based simulations. Conclusion DNA nanocasting represents a new framework for the programmable digital fabrication of 3D inorganic nanostructures with prescribed shapes, dimensions, and surface modifications at sub– 5-nm resolution. The key design strategy is to encode linear sequences of DNA with the sophisticated user-specified 3D spatial and surface information of an inorganic NP, as well as to retrieve and execute the information to physically produce this structure via geometric confinement. Such a method may lead to computationally designed functional materials for the digital manufacture of optical nanocircuits, electronic nanocomputers, and perhaps even sophisticated inorganic nanorobots, each with their blueprints (or “genomes’’) encoded in the DNA molecules that constitute their “nanofabricators.”"

In particular, desert-dwelling sidewinder rattlesnakes ( Crotalus cerastes ) operate effectively on inclined granular media (such as sand dunes) that induce failure in field-tested limbless robots through slipping and pitching. Our laboratory experiments reveal that as granular incline angle increases, sidewinder rattlesnakes increase the length of their body in contact with the sand. Implementing this strategy in a physical robot model of the snake enables the device to ascend sandy slopes close to the angle of maximum slope stability. Plate drag experiments demonstrate that granular yield stresses decrease with increasing incline angle. Together, these three approaches demonstrate how sidewinding with contact-length control mitigates failure on granular media."

We present a possible local analog that has an escape fraction of ionizing flux of 21%. Our detection confirms the existence of gaps in the neutral gas enveloping the starburst region. The candidate contains a massive yet highly compact star-forming region. The gaps are most likely created by the unusually strong winds and intense ionizing radiation produced by this extreme object. Our study also validates the indirect technique of using the residual flux in saturated low-ionization interstellar absorption lines for identifying such leaky galaxies. Because direct detection of ionizing flux is impossible at the epoch of reionization, this represents a highly valuable technique for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2046079579,"Longer lives and fertility far below the replacement level of 2.1 births per woman are leading to rapid population aging in many countries. Many observers are concerned that aging will adversely affect public finances and standards of living. Analysis of newly available National Transfer Accounts data for 40 countries shows that fertility well above replacement would typically be most beneficial for government budgets. However, fertility near replacement would be most beneficial for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. And fertility below replacement would maximize per capita consumption when the cost of providing capital for a growing labor force is taken into account. Although low fertility will indeed challenge government programs and very low fertility undermines living standards, we find that moderately low fertility and population decline favor the broader material standard of living."
https://openalex.org/W2030104183,"During animal cell division, the cleavage furrow is positioned by microtubules that signal to the actin cortex at the cell midplane. We developed a cell-free system to recapitulate cytokinesis signaling using cytoplasmic extract from Xenopus eggs. Microtubules grew out as asters from artificial centrosomes and met to organize antiparallel overlap zones. These zones blocked the interpenetration of neighboring asters and recruited cytokinesis midzone proteins, including the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) and centralspindlin. The CPC was transported to overlap zones, which required two motor proteins, Kif4A and a Kif20A paralog. Using supported lipid bilayers to mimic the plasma membrane, we observed the recruitment of cleavage furrow markers, including an active RhoA reporter, at microtubule overlaps. This system opens further approaches to understanding the biophysics of cytokinesis signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2041184972,"Cycloaddition is an essential tool in chemical synthesis. Instead of using light or heat as a driving force, marine sponges promote cycloaddition with a more versatile but poorly understood mechanism in producing pyrrole–imidazole alkaloids sceptrin, massadine, and ageliferin. Through de novo synthesis of sceptrin and massadine, we show that sponges may use single-electron oxidation as a central mechanism to promote three different types of cycloaddition. Additionally, we provide surprising evidence that, in contrast to previous reports, sceptrin, massadine, and ageliferin have mismatched chirality. Therefore, massadine cannot be an oxidative rearrangement product of sceptrin or ageliferin, as is commonly believed. Taken together, our results demonstrate unconventional chemical approaches to achieving cycloaddition reactions in synthesis and uncover enantiodivergence as a new biosynthetic paradigm for natural products."

https://openalex.org/W2144999739,"The human cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1) enzyme operates at a key juncture of human steroidogenesis, controlling the levels of mineralocorticoids influencing blood pressure, glucocorticoids involved in immune and stress responses, and androgens and estrogens involved in development and homeostasis of reproductive tissues. Understanding CYP17A1 multifunctional biochemistry is thus integral to treating prostate and breast cancer, subfertility, blood pressure, and other diseases. CYP17A1 structures with all four physiologically relevant steroid substrates suggest answers to four fundamental aspects of CYP17A1 function. First, all substrates bind in a similar overall orientation, rising ∼60° with respect to the heme. Second, both hydroxylase substrates pregnenolone and progesterone hydrogen bond to Asn202 in orientations consistent with production of 17α-hydroxy major metabolites, but functional and structural evidence for an A105L mutation suggests that a minor conformation may yield the minor 16α-hydroxyprogesterone metabolite. Third, substrate specificity of the subsequent 17,20-lyase reaction may be explained by variation in substrate height above the heme. Although 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is only observed farther from the catalytic iron, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone is also observed closer to the heme. In conjunction with spectroscopic evidence, this suggests that only 17α-hydroxypregnenolone approaches and interacts with the proximal oxygen of the catalytic iron-peroxy intermediate, yielding efficient production of dehydroepiandrosterone as the key intermediate in human testosterone and estrogen synthesis. Fourth, differential positioning of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone offers a mechanism whereby allosteric binding of cytochrome b5 might selectively enhance the lyase reaction. In aggregate, these structures provide a structural basis for understanding multiple key reactions at the heart of human steroidogenesis.

The cytochrome P450 superfamily of heme monooxygenases performs diverse physiological functions, ranging from drug and xenobiotic metabolism to hormone and vitamin biosynthesis. The human cytochrome P450 (P450) 3The abbreviations used are: P450cytochrome P450b5cytochrome b5RMSDroot mean square deviation. enzyme 17A1 (CYP17A1) functions specifically at a critical juncture in human steroidogenesis (1Miller W.L. Auchus R.J. The molecular biology, biochemistry, and physiology of human steroidogenesis and its disorders.Endocr. Rev. 2011; 32: 81-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Its initial substrates are also substrates for mineralocorticoid biosynthesis by other enzymes. CYP17A1 catalysis leads to either steroid precursors of glucocorticoids like cortisol that regulate immune response or androgens like testosterone that drive the development and maintenance of male characteristics or are converted to estrogens in females (2Gilep A.A. Sushko T.A. Usanov S.A. At the crossroads of steroid hormone biosynthesis: the role, substrate specificity and evolutionary development of CYP17.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1814: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In later life, however, androgens drive the development of prostate cancer, the cancer of highest incidence and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men, whereas estrogens are a long recognized driver of hormone-responsive breast cancer (3Edwards B.K.

Thus this enzyme has garnered substantial interest as a relatively new drug target, validated by successful use of the CYP17A1 inhibitor abiraterone in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (4Ferraldeschi R. de Bono J.

Abiraterone acetate, the Food and Drug Administration-approved prodrug form of this CYP17A1 inhibitor, improves overall survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, including patients for whom the disease has progressed following chemotherapy, with compounds such as docetaxel and the androgen receptor blocker enzalutamide (5de Bono J.S.

Structures of cytochrome P450 17A1 with prostate cancer drugs abiraterone and TOK-001.Nature. 2012; 482: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) that is essential for catalysis, which effectively and systemically prevents androgen production. However, by doing so, this inhibitor also increases the pool of precursors for mineralocorticoid production and halts CYP17A1-mediated production of glucocorticoids, which occurs in the same active site and also requires the heme iron. The resulting steroid imbalances in patients treated with abiraterone can frequently lead to hypertension, hypokalemia, and adrenocortical insufficiency, which must then be monitored and treated with additional drugs (9Pia A. Vignani F. Attard G. Tucci M. Bironzo P. Scagliotti G. Arlt W. Terzolo M. Berruti A. Strategies for managing ACTH dependent mineralocorticoid excess induced by abiraterone.Cancer Treat. Rev. 2013; 39: 966-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is some evidence that the increase in mineralocorticoids associated with complete inhibition of CYP17A1 may facilitate the flow of androgen precursors through a “backdoor” androgen biosynthesis pathway (10Attard G. Reid A.H. Auchus R.J. Hughes B.A. Cassidy A.M. Thompson E. Oommen N.B. Folkerd E. Dowsett M. Arlt W. de Bono J.S. Clinical and biochemical consequences of CYP17A1 inhibition with abiraterone given with and without exogenous glucocorticoids in castrate men with advanced prostate cancer.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2012; 97: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), proposed to provide a possible escape route that could permit cancer progression. Selective inhibition of the CYP17A1-mediated androgen biosynthesis proven to increase overall survival, whereas sparing CYP17A1-mediated glucocorticoid biosynthesis to prevent corticosteroid imbalances would ameliorate both of these clinically relevant issues for prostate cancer patients. CYP17A1 impairment has also been associated with Cushing's syndrome (11Ogo A. Haji M. Ohashi M. Nawata H.

Some new thoughts on the pathophysiology and genetics of polycystic ovary syndrome.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 997: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Substantial potential for improving prostate cancer treatment and therapies for these other diseases thus lies in an improved understanding of the mechanisms whereby CYP17A1 performs catalysis. In general, CYP17A1 hydroxylates the mineralocorticoid precursor steroids pregnenolone and progesterone to yield 17α-hydroxypregnenolone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, respectively (see Fig. 1). These resulting C17-hydroxylated steroids can serve as substrates for glucocorticoid biosynthesis or for the subsequent CYP17A1-mediated 17,20-lyase reaction to yield the androgens dehydroepiandrosterone or androstenedione (see Fig. 1). Functional variations on this general pathway for different substrates provide clues to key protein/small molecule interactions that direct catalysis. First, although human CYP17A1 hydroxylates pregnenolone (a Δ5,3-ol steroid) only at carbon 17, progesterone (the corresponding Δ4,3-keto steroid) is hydroxylated at C17 as the major product, but also at C16 to generate an additional minor product (see Fig. 1) (14Arlt W. Martens J.W. Song M. Wang J.T. Auchus R.J. Miller W.L.

Metab. 1993; 77: 98-102PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that in other species CYP17A1 with Leu at position 105 generates much less 16α-hydroxyprogesterone (14Arlt W. Martens J.W. Song M. Wang J.T.

Biol. 2010; 119: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Suggested to somehow alter substrate position in the CYP17A1 active site or alter protein flexibility, the structural basis for the effects of the A105L mutation on substrate and regioselectivity of hydroxylation have not been elucidated experimentally. Second, CYP17A1 also performs a carbon-carbon bond cleavage, which is unusual for cytochrome P450 enzymes (18Sohl C.D. Guengerich F.P. Kinetic analysis of the three-step steroid aromatase reaction of human cytochrome P450 19A1.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For human CYP17A1, this 17,20-lyase reaction proceeds far less efficiently for the Δ4,3-keto 17α-hydroxyprogesterone substrate than for its counterpart, the Δ5,3-ol 17α-hydroxypregnenolone (see Fig. 1). As a result, the Δ5,3-ol 17α-hydroxypregnenolone 17,20-lyase product dehydroepiandrosterone (see Fig. 1) is the physiologically relevant intermediate in the formation of all human androgens and estrogens (19Flück C.E.

Metab. 2003; 88: 3762-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although hydroxylation is well established to occur by the Groves hydrogen abstraction/oxygen rebound mechanism mediated by an Fe(IV)-oxo catalytic intermediate called Compound I (20Guengerich F.P.

Recent data, however, favors a ferric peroxy anion intermediate (see Fig. 1) (22Akhtar M. Corina D. Miller S. Shyadehi A.Z. Wright J.N.

Compartmentalization of b5 and developmental changes in b5 levels control the tissue specificity and timing of androgen production in humans. Individuals with nonfunctional b5 are unable to perform the lyase reaction and produce sex steroids, although the hydroxylase reaction required for glucocorticoid synthesis is operational (29Idkowiak J.

Facilitation of the lyase reaction by b5 occurs without electron delivery (25Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L.

Thus it has been suggested that b5 might selectively stabilize the intermediate in the lyase reaction or cause substrates to assume orientations in the CYP17A1 active site more favorable for the lyase chemistry, but the mechanism remains unresolved (31Naffin-Olivos J.L. Auchus R.J. Human cytochrome b5 requires residues E48 and E49 to stimulate the 17,20-lyase activity of cytochrome P450c17.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The structural basis for each of these effects—hydroxylase substrate regioselectivity, lyase reaction selectivity for the Δ4,3-keto versus Δ5,3-ol 17-hydroxylated substrate, and cytochrome b5 facilitation of the lyase versus hydroxylase reaction—is unknown. Homology models and docking studies have suggested that substrates were likely to orient essentially parallel to the plane of the heme (32Auchus R.J. Miller W.L.

The only known structures of CYP17A1, in the presence of the steroidal inhibitors abiraterone or TOK-001, were published recently (8DeVore N.M. Scott E.E. Structures of cytochrome P450 17A1 with prostate cancer drugs abiraterone and TOK-001.Nature. 2012; 482: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). These steroidal inhibitors both orient more nearly perpendicular to the heme, evoking the prediction of a similar binding mode for substrates (8DeVore N.M. Scott E.E. Structures of cytochrome P450 17A1 with prostate cancer drugs abiraterone and TOK-001.Nature. 2012; 482: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), but the actual binding of CYP17A1 substrates is unknown. To probe the binding orientations of the physiologically relevant substrates and the structural basis of CYP17A1 function, a series of experimental x-ray structures were generated for CYP17A1 in complexes with both hydroxylase and both lyase substrates with the mutation A105L. Comparisons among these structures identify steric and hydrogen bonding interactions between CYP17A1 and distal portions of the substrate that play key roles in modulating spatial relationships between sites of metabolism on the opposite end of substrates and the catalytic heme iron. A steric rationale is provided for hydroxylase regioselectivity, whereas differences observed for hydrogen bonding and substrate positioning may form the basis for substrate selectivity of the lyase reaction. This new information informs a working hypothesis for how cytochrome b5 might selectively facilitate the lyase reaction. The CYP17A1 gene in the pCWori+ vector has an N-terminal truncation of residues 1–19, a slight modification of the new N terminus, and a C-terminal 4× histidine tag, as described (8DeVore N.M. Scott E.E. Structures of cytochrome P450 17A1 with prostate cancer drugs abiraterone and TOK-001.Nature. 2012; 482: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The A105L mutation was incorporated using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). The resulting pCW17A1Δ19H plasmid containing either the wild type or A105L sequence was transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 cells by heat shock at 42 °C, spread on lysogeny broth agarose plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37 °C. To select for the pCWori+ vector, all expression media were supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Lysogeny broth (5 ml) was inoculated with a single colony from the aforementioned plate and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm for 6 h. Overnight cultures (200 ml of lysogeny broth) were inoculated with 50 μl of the initial culture and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h with 250 rpm shaking. Terrific Broth (1 liter/2.8-liter Fernbach flask) was inoculated with 10 ml of the overnight culture. This culture was grown at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until reaching an optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm. Overexpression was then induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm). The heme precursor δ-aminolevulinic acid was added to 0.61 mm. Cultures were grown at 28 °C with shaking at 140 rpm for an additional 72 h. The cells were then collected by centrifugation at 6300 × g for 10 min. Cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 300 mm NaCl and stored at −80 °C until purification. Cells were thawed and lysed by sonication (six times for 30 s at 1-min intervals on ice). The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 9900 × g for 15 min. Membrane proteins were extracted by stirring this lysate in the presence 2% (v/v) Emulgen 913 (Desert Biologicals) for 90 min, followed by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h). The resulting supernatant was loaded on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with Ni buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.2% (v/v) Emulgen 913). The resin was subsequently washed with 2 column volumes of Ni buffer, 6 column volumes of Ni buffer supplemented with 100 mm glycine, and eluted using 4 column volumes of Ni buffer supplemented with 100 mm glycine and 80 mm histidine. Elution fractions were pooled based on absorbance of the heme Soret peak, diluted 4.2-fold in CM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 mm glycine), supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) Emulgen 913, and loaded onto a 5-ml carboxymethyl-Sepharose fast-flow column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with CM buffer. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of CM buffer and eluted with CM buffer supplemented with 500 mm NaCl. Fractions were pooled based on the heme Soret absorbance and concentrated to ∼1 ml. Concentrated protein was injected onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm glycine, and 500 mm NaCl. The major peak with absorbance for the heme was collected and concentrated. All purification was performed at 4 °C. CYP17A1 A105L protein generated for crystallization studies was purified with 50 μm of one of the ligands present in all purification buffers. CYP17A1 A105L was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion. Purified protein (∼29 mg/ml) containing either 50 μm of one of the substrates or 10 μm abiraterone and 0.5% (v/v) Emulgen 913 was mixed 1:1 to form 2-μl drops that were then equilibrated against precipitant solution at 20 °C. The precipitant solution used to crystallize CYP17A1 A105L with progesterone, pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, and abiraterone consisted of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 25% (v/v) PEG 4000 (Hampton Research), 150 mm magnesium chloride hexahydrate, and 4–6% (v/v) glycerol. The precipitant solution used to crystallize CYP17A1 A105L with 17α-hydroxyprogesterone contained 175 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 30% (v/v) PEG 3350 (Hampton Research), 250 mm lithium sulfate, and 3% (v/v) glycerol. Crystals were cryoprotected in a 7:3 mixture of mother liquor and 80% (v/v) glycerol and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen.

Hydrogens were modeled in the riding positions for protein and substrates. Reference model restraints were incorporated only for the 3.0 Å 17α-hydroxypregnenolone data set, to avoid overfitting. After the protein structures were essentially completed, ligands were added. The ligand omit 2Fo − Fc maps shown were calculated in PHENIX. Ligand models were obtained from the Hetero-compound Information Center at Uppsala (HIC-Up) or constructed using the PRODRG2 server.

https://openalex.org/W2015979373,"Previous Mendelian randomization studies have suggested that, while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and triglycerides are causally implicated in coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) may not be, with causal effect estimates compatible with the null.The causal effects of these three lipid fractions can be better identified using the extended methods of 'multivariable Mendelian randomization'. We employ this approach using published data on 185 lipid-related genetic variants and their associations with lipid fractions in 188,578 participants, and with CAD risk in 22,233 cases and 64,762 controls. Our results suggest that HDL-c may be causally protective of CAD risk, independently of the effects of LDL-c and triglycerides. Estimated causal odds ratios per standard deviation increase, based on 162 variants not having pleiotropic associations with either blood pressure or body mass index, are 1.57 (95% credible interval 1.45 to 1.70) for LDL-c, 0.91 (0.83 to 0.99, p-value = 0.028) for HDL-c, and 1.29 (1.16 to 1.43) for triglycerides.Some interventions on HDL-c concentrations may influence risk of CAD, but to a lesser extent than interventions on LDL-c. A causal interpretation of these estimates relies on the assumption that the genetic variants do not have pleiotropic associations with risk factors on other pathways to CAD. If they do, a weaker conclusion is that genetic predictors of LDL-c, HDL-c and triglycerides each have independent associations with CAD risk."
https://openalex.org/W2038770923,"The orbits of giant extrasolar planets often have surprisingly small semimajor axes, large eccentricities, or severe misalignments between their orbit normals and their host stars' spin axes. In some formation scenarios invoking Kozai-Lidov oscillations, an external planetary companion drives a planet onto an orbit having these properties. The mutual inclinations for Kozai-Lidov oscillations can be large and have not been confirmed observationally. Here we present evidence that observed eccentric warm Jupiters with eccentric giant companions have mutual inclinations that oscillate between 35° and 65°. Our inference is based on the pairs’ observed apsidal separations, which cluster near 90°. The near-orthogonality of periapse directions is effected by the outer companion's quadrupolar and octupolar potentials. These systems may be undergoing a stalled version of tidal migration that produces warm Jupiters over hot Jupiters, and they provide evidence for a population of multiplanet systems that are not flat and have been sculpted by Kozai-Lidov oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W1987713053,"Neuroinflammation has been implicated in hypertension, and microglia have been proposed to play an important role in the progression of this disease. Here, we have studied whether microglia are activated within cardiovascular regulatory area(s) of the brain during hypertension, especially in high blood pressure that is associated with chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin-system. In addition, we determined whether prorenin, an essential component of the renin-angiotensin-system, exerts direct pro-inflammatory effects on these microglia. Our data indicate that two rodent models which display neurogenic hypertension and over activation of the renin-angiotensin-system in the brain (sRA mice and spontaneously hypertensive rats) exhibit microglial activation, and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, an area crucial for regulation of sympathetic outflow. Further, the renin-angiotensin-system component prorenin elicits direct activation of hypothalamic microglia in culture and induction of pro-inflammatory mechanisms in these cells, effects that involve prorenin receptor-induced NFκB activation. In addition, the prorenin-elicited increases in cytokine expression were fully abolished by microglial inhibitor minocycline, and were potentiated by pre-treatment of cells with angiotensin II. Taken together with our previous data which indicate that pro-inflammatory processes in the paraventricular nucleus are involved in the hypertensive action of renin-angiotensin-system, the novel discovery that prorenin exerts direct stimulatory effects on microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production provides support for the idea that renin-angiotensin-system -induced neurogenic hypertension is not restricted to actions of angiotensin II alone."

Considering the integral role of lysosomes in autophagy and cell death, it was important to assess the effect of Dp44mT on autophagy to further understand its mechanism of action. Notably, Dp44mT affected autophagy by two mechanisms. First, concurrent with its antiproliferative activity, Dp44mT increased the expression of the classical autophagic marker LC3-II as a result of induced autophagosome synthesis. Second, this effect was supplemented by a reduction in autophagosome degradation as shown by the accumulation of the autophagic substrate and receptor p62. Conversely, the classical iron chelator desferrioxamine induced autophagosome accumulation only by inhibiting autophagosome degradation. The formation of redox-active iron or copper Dp44mT complexes was critical for its dual effect on autophagy. The cytoprotective antioxidant N-acetylcysteine inhibited Dp44mT-induced autophagosome synthesis and p62 accumulation. Importantly, Dp44mT inhibited autophagosome degradation via lysosomal disruption. This effect prevented the fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes to form autolysosomes, which is crucial for the completion of the autophagic process.

https://openalex.org/W2032118563,"Rho GTPases are frequent targets of virulence factors as they are keystone signaling molecules. Herein, we demonstrate that AMPylation of Rho GTPases by VopS is a multifaceted virulence mechanism that counters several host immunity strategies. Activation of NFκB, Erk, and JNK kinase signaling pathways were inhibited in a VopS-dependent manner during infection with Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Phosphorylation and degradation of IKBα were inhibited in the presence of VopS as was nuclear translocation of the NFκB subunit p65. AMPylation also prevented the generation of superoxide by the phagocytic NADPH oxidase complex, potentially by inhibiting the interaction of Rac and p67. Furthermore, the interaction of GTPases with the E3 ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and XIAP was hindered, leading to decreased degradation of Rac and RhoA during infection. Finally, we screened for novel Rac1 interactions using a nucleic acid programmable protein array and discovered that Rac1 binds to the protein C1QA, a protein known to promote immune signaling in the cytosol. Interestingly, this interaction was disrupted by AMPylation. We conclude that AMPylation of Rho Family GTPases by VopS results in diverse inhibitory consequences during infection beyond the most obvious phenotype, the collapse of the actin cytoskeleton."

https://openalex.org/W2047915156,"Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is considered as an effective modality for renal replacement therapy in hemodynamically unstable patients within intensive care units (ICUs). However, the role of heparin anticoagulation, which is used to maintain circuit patency, is equivocal due to the risk of bleeding and morbidity. Among various alternative anticoagulants, nafamostat mesilate has been shown to be an effective anticoagulant in patients prone to bleeding. Hence, we conducted a prospective, randomized controlled study investigating the effect of nafamostat mesilate on mortality, CRRT filter life span and adverse events in patients with bleeding tendency. Seventy-three Patients were randomized into either the futhan or no-anticoagulation group. Thirty-six subjects in the futhan group received nafamostat mesilate, while thirty seven subjects in the no-anticoagulation group received no anticoagulants. Baseline characteristics and appropriate laboratory tests were taken from each group. The mortality between the two groups was not significantly different. Nevertheless, between the futhan group and the no-anticoagulation group, the overall number of filters used during CRRT (2.71 ± 2.12 vs. 4.50 ± 3.25; p = 0.042) and the number of filters changed due to clots per 24 hours (1.15 ± 0.81 vs. 1.74 ± 1.62; p = 0.040) were significantly different. When filter life span was subdivided into below and over 12 hours, the number of filters functioning over 12 hours was significantly higher in the futhan group than in the no-anticoagulation group (p = 0.037, odds ratio 1.84). There were no significant differences in transfusion, mortality, or survival between the two groups, and no adverse events related to nafamostat mesilate were noted. Hence, nafamostat mesilate may be used as an effective and safe anticoagulant, without increasing the risk of major bleeding complications, in patients prone to bleeding.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01761994."
https://openalex.org/W2015815276,"MMP-12, a macrophage-secreted elastase, is elevated in fibrotic diseases, including systemic sclerosis (SSc) and correlates with vasculopathy and fibrosis. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of MMP-12 in cardiac and cutaneous fibrosis induced by angiotensin II infusion. Ang II-induced heart and skin fibrosis was accompanied by a marked increase of vascular injury markers, including vWF, Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and MMP-12, as well as increased number of PDGFRβ+ cells. Furthermore Ang II infusion led to an accumulation of macrophages (Mac3+) in the skin and in the perivascular and interstitial fibrotic regions of the heart. However, alternatively activated (Arg 1+) macrophages were mainly present in the Ang II infused mice and were localized to the perivascular heart regions and to the skin, but were not detected in the interstitial heart regions. Elevated expression of MMP-12 was primarily found in macrophages and endothelial cells (CD31+) cells, but MMP-12 was not expressed in the collagen producing cells. MMP-12 deficient mice (MMP12KO) showed markedly reduced expression of vWF, TSP1, and PDGFRβ around vessels and attenuation of dermal fibrosis, as well as the perivascular fibrosis in the heart. However, MMP-12 deficiency did not affect interstitial heart fibrosis, suggesting a heterogeneous nature of the fibrotic response in the heart. Furthermore, MMP-12 deficiency almost completely prevented accumulation of Arg 1+ cells, whereas the number of Mac3+ cells was partially reduced. Moreover production of profibrotic mediators such as PDGFBB, TGFβ1 and pSMAD2 in the skin and perivascular regions of the heart was also inhibited. Together, the results of this study show a close correlation between vascular injury markers, Arg 1+ macrophage accumulation and fibrosis and suggest an important role of MMP-12 in regulating these processes."
https://openalex.org/W2023248068,"A number of different enzymatic pathways have evolved to ensure that DNA replication can proceed past template base damage. These pathways include lesion skipping by the replisome, replication fork regression followed by either correction of the damage and origin-independent replication restart or homologous recombination-mediated restart of replication downstream of the lesion, and bypass of the damage by a translesion synthesis DNA polymerase. We report here that of two translesion synthesis polymerases tested, only DNA polymerase IV, not DNA polymerase II, could engage productively with the Escherichia coli replisome to bypass leading strand template damage, despite the fact that both enzymes are shown to be interacting with the replicase. Inactivation of the 3' → 5' proofreading exonuclease of DNA polymerase II did not enable bypass. Bypass by DNA polymerase IV required its ability to interact with the β clamp and act as a translesion polymerase but did not require its ""little finger"" domain, a secondary region of interaction with the β clamp. Bypass by DNA polymerase IV came at the expense of the inherent leading strand lesion skipping activity of the replisome, indicating that they are competing reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1983491043,"ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), ABCG1, and ABCG4 are lipid transporters that mediate the efflux of cholesterol from cells. To analyze the characteristics of these lipid transporters, we examined and compared their distributions and lipid efflux activity on the plasma membrane. The efflux of cholesterol mediated by ABCA1 and ABCG1, but not ABCG4, was affected by a reduction of cellular sphingomyelin levels. Detergent solubility and gradient density ultracentrifugation assays indicated that ABCA1, ABCG1, and ABCG4 were distributed to domains that were solubilized by Triton X-100 and Brij 96, resistant to Triton X-100 and Brij 96, and solubilized by Triton X-100 but resistant to Brij 96, respectively. Furthermore, ABCG1, but not ABCG4, was colocalized with flotillin-1 on the plasma membrane. The amounts of cholesterol extracted by methyl-β-cyclodextrin were increased by ABCA1, ABCG1, or ABCG4, suggesting that cholesterol in non-raft domains was increased. Furthermore, ABCG1 and ABCG4 disturbed the localization of caveolin-1 to the detergent-resistant domains and the binding of cholera toxin subunit B to the plasma membrane. These results suggest that ABCA1, ABCG1, and ABCG4 are localized to distinct membrane meso-domains and disturb the meso-domain structures by reorganizing lipids on the plasma membrane; collectively, these observations may explain the different substrate profiles and lipid efflux roles of these transporters."
https://openalex.org/W1992683562,"Background People aged 85 and over are often excluded from research on the grounds of being difficult to recruit and problematic to retain. The Newcastle 85+ study successfully recruited a cohort of 854 85-year-olds to detailed health assessment at baseline and followed them up over 3 phases spanning 5 years. This paper describes the effectiveness of its retention strategies. Methods Primary retention strategies involved meticulous management of contact information and active maintenance of contact with participants between research visits and between phases of the study. For statistical analysis, data on post-inclusion attrition over the 3 follow-up phases was separated into ‘death’ and ‘withdrawal’ categories, with sub-categories ‘health’ and ‘non-health’ reasons created for ‘withdrawal’. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine if particular socio-demographic and health characteristics were associated with post-inclusion attrition due to withdrawal at each of the 3 phase-to-phase transition points. Results For both sexes, at successive follow-up phases there was a decrease in attrition due to withdrawal and an increase due to death. Withdrawal was most prevalent between baseline and phase 2. Across the 5 years of the study total post-inclusion (post-baseline) attrition due to death accounted for a 40% (344/854) loss to cohort and total post-inclusion attrition due to withdraw a 19% (166/854) loss to cohort, with health reasons for withdrawal becoming more dominant over time. Adjusting for sex, parsimonious modelling showed only occupational class (National Statistics Socio-economic Classification) to be associated with withdrawal and only between baseline and phase 2 (routine/manual compared to managerial (OR 3.41; 95% CI [1.23 to 9.44]). Conclusion Following successful recruitment, we retained a high proportion of participants from a very old age group over 5 years of longitudinal research. No strong predictors of post-inclusion attrition due to withdrawal were found, suggesting the general effectiveness of our retention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2027562875,"Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the fifth most common cancer type and the third highest cause of cancer death worldwide, develops in different types of liver injuries, and is mostly associated with cirrhosis. However, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease often causes HCC with less fibrosis, and the number of patients with this disease is rapidly increasing. The high mortality rate and the pathological complexity of liver diseases and HCC require blood biomarkers that accurately reflect the state of liver damage and presence of HCC. Methods and Findings Here we demonstrate that a circulating protein, apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM) may meet this requirement. A large-scale analysis of healthy individuals across a wide age range revealed a mean blood AIM of 4.99±1.8 µg/ml in men and 6.06±2.1 µg/ml in women. AIM levels were significantly augmented in the younger generation (20s–40s), particularly in women. Interestingly, AIM levels were markedly higher in patients with advanced liver damage, regardless of disease type, and correlated significantly with multiple parameters representing liver function. In mice, AIM levels increased in response to carbon tetrachloride, confirming that the high AIM observed in humans is the result of liver damage. In addition, carbon tetrachloride caused comparable states of liver damage in AIM-deficient and wild-type mice, indicating no influence of AIM levels on liver injury progression. Intriguingly, certain combinations of AIM indexes normalized to liver marker score significantly distinguished HCC patients from non-HCC patients and thus could be applicable for HCC diagnosis.

Methods Forty virgin eyes and 42 post-PRK eyes underwent CorVis ST measurements performed by two technicians. Repeatability was evaluated by comparing three consecutive measurements by technician A. Reproducibility was determined by comparing the first measurement by technician A with one performed by technician B. Intraobserver and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated. Univariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare measured parameters between virgin and post-PRK eyes. Results The intraocular pressure (IOP), central corneal thickness (CCT) and 1st applanation time demonstrated good intraobserver repeatability and interobserver reproducibility (ICC≧0.90) in virgin and post-PRK eyes. The deformation amplitude showed a good or close to good repeatability and reproducibility in both groups (ICC≧0.88). The CCT correlated positively with 1st applanation time (r = 0.437 and 0.483, respectively, p<0.05) and negatively with deformation amplitude (r = −0.384 and −0.375, respectively, p<0.05) in both groups. Compared to post-PRK eyes, virgin eyes showed longer 1st applanation time (7.29±0.21 vs. 6.96±0.17 ms, p<0.05) and lower deformation amplitude (1.06±0.07 vs. 1.17±0.08 mm, p<0.05). Conclusions CorVis ST demonstrated reliable measurements for CCT, IOP, and 1st applanation time, as well as relatively reliable measurement for deformation amplitude in both virgin and post-PRK eyes. There were differences in 1st applanation time and deformation amplitude between virgin and post-PRK eyes, which may reflect corneal biomechanical changes occurring after the surgery in the latter."
https://openalex.org/W2086793679,"Sarcolipin (SLN) is a regulatory peptide present in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) from skeletal muscle of animals. We find that native rabbit SLN is modified by a fatty acid anchor on Cys-9 with a palmitic acid in about 60% and, surprisingly, an oleic acid in the remaining 40%. SLN used for co-crystallization with SERCA1a (Winther, A. M., Bublitz, M., Karlsen, J. L., Moller, J. V., Hansen, J. B., Nissen, P., and Buch-Pedersen, M. J. (2013) Nature 495, 265-2691; Ref. 1) is also palmitoylated/oleoylated, but is not visible in crystal structures, probably due to disorder. Treatment with 1 m hydroxylamine for 1 h removes the fatty acids from a majority of the SLN pool. This treatment did not modify the SERCA1a affinity for Ca(2+) but increased the Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase activity of SR membranes indicating that the S-acylation of SLN or of other proteins is required for this effect on SERCA1a. Pig SLN is also fully palmitoylated/oleoylated on its Cys-9 residue, but in a reverse ratio of about 40/60. An alignment of 67 SLN sequences from the protein databases shows that 19 of them contain a cysteine and the rest a phenylalanine at position 9. Based on a cladogram, we postulate that the mutation from phenylalanine to cysteine in some species is the result of an evolutionary convergence. We suggest that, besides phosphorylation, S-acylation/deacylation also regulates SLN activity."
https://openalex.org/W2084064806,"Cotranscriptional methylation of histone H3 lysines 4 and 36 by Set1 and Set2, respectively, stimulates interaction between nucleosomes and histone deacetylase complexes to block cryptic transcription in budding yeast. We previously showed that loss of all H3K4 and H3K36 methylation in a set1Δset2Δ mutant reduces interaction between native nucleosomes and the NuA4 lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) complex. We now provide evidence that NuA4 preferentially binds H3 tails mono- and dimethylated on H3K4 and di- and trimethylated on H3K36, an H3 methylation pattern distinct from that recognized by the RPD3C(S) and Hos2/Set3 histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs). Loss of H3K4 or H3K36 methylation in set1Δ or set2Δ mutants reduces NuA4 interaction with bulk nucleosomes in vitro and in vivo, and reduces NuA4 occupancy of transcribed coding sequences at particular genes. We also provide evidence that NuA4 acetylation of lysine residues in the histone H4 tail stimulates SAGA interaction with nucleosomes and its recruitment to coding sequences and attendant acetylation of histone H3 in vivo. Thus, H3 methylation exerts opposing effects of enhancing nucleosome acetylation by both NuA4 and SAGA as well as stimulating nucleosome deacetylation by multiple HDACs to maintain the proper level of histone acetylation in transcribed coding sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1970308773,"Background and Aims Endothelial small- and intermediate-conductance KCa channels, SK3 and IK1, are key mediators in the endothelium-derived hyperpolarization and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and also in the modulation of endothelial Ca2+ signaling and nitric oxide (NO) release. Obesity is associated with endothelial dysfunction and impaired relaxation, although how obesity influences endothelial SK3/IK1 function is unclear. Therefore we assessed whether the role of these channels in the coronary circulation is altered in obese animals. Methods and Results In coronary arteries mounted in microvascular myographs, selective blockade of SK3/IK1 channels unmasked an increased contribution of these channels to the ACh- and to the exogenous NO- induced relaxations in arteries of Obese Zucker Rats (OZR) compared to Lean Zucker Rats (LZR). Relaxant responses induced by the SK3/IK1 channel activator NS309 were enhanced in OZR and NO- endothelium-dependent in LZR, whereas an additional endothelium-independent relaxant component was found in OZR. Fura2-AM fluorescence revealed a larger ACh-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in the endothelium of coronary arteries from OZR, which was inhibited by blockade of SK3/IK1 channels in both LZR and OZR. Western blot analysis showed an increased expression of SK3/IK1 channels in coronary arteries of OZR and immunohistochemistry suggested that it takes place predominantly in the endothelial layer. Conclusions Obesity may induce activation of adaptive vascular mechanisms to preserve the dilator function in coronary arteries. Increased function and expression of SK3/IK1 channels by influencing endothelial Ca2+ dynamics might contribute to the unaltered endothelium-dependent coronary relaxation in the early stages of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1979944006,"Mesotrypsin is an isoform of trypsin that is uniquely resistant to polypeptide trypsin inhibitors and can cleave some inhibitors rapidly. Previous studies have shown that the amyloid precursor protein Kunitz protease inhibitor domain (APPI) is a specific substrate of mesotrypsin and that stabilization of the APPI cleavage site in a canonical conformation contributes to recognition by mesotrypsin. We hypothesized that other proteins possessing potential cleavage sites stabilized in a similar conformation might also be mesotrypsin substrates. Here we evaluated a series of candidate substrates, including human Kunitz protease inhibitor domains from amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2), bikunin, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 2 (HAI2), tissue factor pathway inhibitor-1 (TFPI1), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI2), as well as E-selectin, an unrelated protein possessing a potential cleavage site displaying canonical conformation. We find that Kunitz domains within APLP2, bikunin, and HAI2 are cleaved by mesotrypsin with kinetic profiles of specific substrates. TFPI1 and TFPI2 Kunitz domains are cleaved less efficiently by mesotrypsin, and E-selectin is not cleaved at the anticipated site. Cocrystal structures of mesotrypsin with HAI2 and bikunin Kunitz domains reveal the mode of mesotrypsin interaction with its canonical substrates. Our data suggest that major determinants of mesotrypsin substrate specificity include sequence preferences at the P1 and P'2 positions along with conformational stabilization of the cleavage site in the canonical conformation. Mesotrypsin up-regulation has been implicated previously in cancer progression, and proteolytic clearance of Kunitz protease inhibitors offers potential mechanisms by which mesotrypsin may mediate pathological effects in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1989089037,"Background Resistance to cephalosporins in Enterobacteriaceae is mainly due to the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Little is known about ESBL-producing bacteria in Bangladesh. Therefore, the study presents results of phenotypic and molecular characterization of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli from hospitals in Bangladesh. Methods A total of 339 E. coli isolated from patients with urinary tract and wound infections attending three different medical hospitals in urban and rural areas of Bangladesh between 2003–2007 were screened for ESBL-production by the double disk diffusion test. Isolates with ESBL-phenotype were further characterized by antibiotic susceptibility testing, PCR and sequencing of different β-lactamase and virulence genes, serotyping, and XbaI-macrorestriction followed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results We identified 40 E. coli with ESBL phenotype. These isolates were resistant to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, aztreonam, cefepime, and nalidixic acid but remained susceptible to imipenem. All but one isolate were additionally resistant to ciprofloxacin, and 3 isolates were resistant to cefoxitin. ESBL genes of blaCTX-M-1-group were detected in all isolates; blaTEM-type and blaOXA-1-type genes were detected in 33 (82.5%) and 19 (47.5%) isolates, respectively. Virulence genes that are present in diarrhoeagenic E. coli were not found. Class-1 integron was present in 20 (50%) isolates. All the ESBL-producing E. coli isolates harbored plasmids ranging between 1.1 and 120 MDa. PFGE-typing revealed 26 different pulsotypes, but identical pulsotype showed 6 isolates of serotype O25:H4. Conclusion The prevalence of multidrug-resistant ESBL-producing E. coli isolates appears to be high and the majority of the isolates were positive for blaCTX-M. Although there was genetic heterogeneity among isolates, presence of a cluster of isolates belonging to serotype O25:H4 indicates dissemination of the pandemic uropathogenic E. coli clone in Bangladesh."

Understanding the role that PG-Gs play in a biological setting has been difficult because of their sensitivity to enzymatic hydrolysis. By comparing PG-G hydrolysis across human cancer cell lines to serine hydrolase activities determined by activity-based protein profiling, we identified lysophospholipase A2 (LYPLA2) as a major enzyme responsible for PG-G hydrolysis. The principal role played by LYPLA2 in PGE2-G hydrolysis was confirmed by siRNA knockdown. Purified recombinant LYPLA2 hydrolyzed PG-Gs in the following order of activity: PGE2-G > PGF2α-G > PGD2-G; LYPLA2 hydrolyzed 1- but not 2-arachidonoylglycerol or arachidonoylethanolamide. Chemical inhibition of LYPLA2 in the mouse macrophage-like cell line, RAW264.7, elicited an increase in PG-G production. Our data indicate that LYPLA2 serves as a major PG-G hydrolase in human cells. Perturbation of this enzyme should enable selective modulation of PG-Gs without alterations in endocannabinoids, thereby providing a means to decipher the unique functions of PG-Gs in biology and disease.

https://openalex.org/W1980469423,"The key member of the MOZ (monocyticleukaemia zinc finger protein), Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2, and TIP60 acetyltransferases family, Tat-interactive protein, 60 kD (TIP60), tightly modulates a wide array of cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, gene transcription, apoptosis, DNA repair, and cell cycle arrest. The function of TIP60 can be regulated by SIRT1 through deacetylation. Here we found that TIP60 can also be functionally regulated by HDAC3. We identified six lysine residues as its autoacetylation sites. Mutagenesis of these lysines to arginines completely abolishes the autoacetylation of TIP60. Overexpression of HDAC3 increases TIP60 ubiquitination levels. However, unlike SIRT1, HDAC3 increased the half-life of TIP60. Further study found that HDAC3 colocalized with TIP60 both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, which could be the reason why HDAC3 can stabilize TIP60. The deacetylation of TIP60 by both SIRT1 and HDAC3 reduces apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Knockdown of HDAC3 in cells increased TIP60 acetylation levels and increased apoptosis after DNA damage. Together, our findings provide a better understanding of TIP60 regulation mechanisms, which is a significant basis for further studies of its cellular functions."

BMS-791325 is a novel direct antiviral agent specifically targeting HCV NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Robust viral clearance of HCV was observed in infected patients treated with BMS-791325 in combination with other anti-HCV agents in Phase 2 clinical studies. Biochemical and biophysical studies revealed that BMS-791325 is a time-dependent, non-competitive inhibitor of the polymerase. Binding studies with NS5B genetic variants (WT, L30S, and P495L) exposed a two-step, slow binding mechanism, but details of the binding mechanism differed for each of the polymerase variants. For the clinically relevant resistance variant (P495L), the rate of initial complex formation and dissociation is similar to WT, but the kinetics of the second step is significantly faster, showing that this variant impacts the final tight complex. The resulting shortened residence time translates into the observed decrease in inhibitor potency. The L30S variant has a significantly different profile. The rate of initial complex formation and dissociation is 7–10 times faster for the L30S variant compared with WT; however, the forward and reverse rates to form the final complex are not significantly different. The impact of the L30S variant on the inhibition profile and binding kinetics of BMS-791325 provides experimental evidence for the dynamic interaction of fingers and thumb domains in an environment that supports the formation of active replication complexes and the initiation of RNA synthesis.

Resistance selection in the replicon system identified substitutions at proline 495, an amino acid 30 Å from the active site, as responsible for resistance. Based on the mechanistic and resistance selection results, the authors proposed that the allosteric thumb site 1 inhibitors interact with the enzyme-RNA complex and impact a slow conformational transition, preceding nucleotide binding, which is required for the formation of productive initiation complexes. When co-crystal structures of NS5B and two structurally similar inhibitors confirmed the site of binding (17Di Marco S. Volpari C. Tomei L. Altamura S. Harper S. Narjes F. Koch U. Rowley M.

Enzymes were stored at −80 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50% glycerol. RNA synthesis was measured by detecting the incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotides. Regardless of the assay format used to measure activity, inhibition by BMS-791325 was detected as a decrease in the incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotides compared with an untreated control. In all assay formats, BMS-791325 and control compounds were serially diluted 1:3 in DMSO and transferred to 96-well assay plates (Corning 3365) for a final DMSO concentration of 2%. In all assay formats, except for the assay performed in the presence of scintillation proximity assay beads, the newly synthesized RNA product was precipitated by 10% TCA and quantified on the Packard Top Count NXT scintillation/luminescence counter.

After a 1-h preincubation of NS5B polymerase, template, and compound, primer-dependent RNA synthesis was initiated by the addition of NTP. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h. The half-maximal inhibition values (IC50) were determined using seven different inhibitor concentrations, [I], and calculated using the formula, y = ymin + ((ymax − ymin)/(1 + IC50/x))n, where x is the inhibitor concentration and n is the Hill coefficient. Inhibition modality was determined using a poly(C) template and dinucleotide (pGpG) primer assay.

The precipitated RNA was washed and detected on a Packard Top Count NXT. Experiments to determine the mode of inhibition were also carried out using a poly(A)·dT12·UTP assay, using similar conditions. Because the potency determined for BMS-791325 was close to the enzyme concentration used in the reactions (2.8 nm), Ki, app values were determined by fitting the inhibition data to the Morrison equation in order to account for the depletion of inhibitor in solution (33Morrison J.F.

Because these fatty acids are primarily provided by diet, FAS is normally expressed at low levels; however, it is highly up-regulated in many cancers. Human enoyl-acyl carrier protein-reductase (hER) is one of the FAS catalytic domains, and its inhibition by drugs like triclosan (TCL) can increase cytotoxicity and decrease drug resistance in cancer cells. We have determined the structure of hER in the presence and absence of TCL. TCL was not bound in the active site, as predicted, but rather at the protein-protein interface (PPI). TCL binding induces a dimer orientation change that causes downstream structural rearrangement in critical active site residues. Kinetics studies indicate that TCL is capable of inhibiting the isolated hER domain with an IC50 of ∼55 μm. Given the hER-TCL structure and the inhibition observed in the hER domain, it seems likely that TCL is observed in the physiologically relevant binding site and that it acts as an allosteric PPI inhibitor.

Acid secretion into the lumen is triggered by activation of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) cascade, which ultimately results in the insertion of gastric H,K-ATPases into the apical plasma membranes of parietal cells. A coupling protein is ezrin whose phosphorylation at Ser-66 by PKA is required for parietal cell activation. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism(s) by which ezrin operates in gastric acid secretion. Here we show that phosphorylation of Ser-66 induces a conformational change of ezrin that enables its association with syntaxin 3 (Stx3) and provides a spatial cue for H,K-ATPase trafficking. This conformation-dependent association is specific for Stx3, and the binding interface is mapped to the N-terminal region. Biochemical analyses show that inhibition of ezrin phosphorylation at Ser-66 prevents ezrin-Stx3 association and insertion of H,K-ATPase into the apical plasma membrane of parietal cells. Using atomic force microscopic analyses, our study revealed that phosphorylation of Ser-66 induces unfolding of ezrin molecule to allow Stx3 binding to its N terminus.

https://openalex.org/W2070591219,"Background Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) expression is decreased in placenta of some cases of preeclampsia (PE) which may result in free fatty acid (FFA) increased. High FFA level will induce oxidative stress, so abnormal long-chain fatty acid-oxidation may participate in the pathogenesis of PE through oxidative stress pathway. Methods PE-like groups were ApoC3 transgenic mice with abnormal fatty acid metabolism, classical PE-like models with injection of Nw-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) mouse model with β2GPI injection (ApoC3+NS, ApoC3+L-NA, L-NA, LPS and β2GPI groups). The control group was wild-type mice with normal saline injection. Except for β2GPI mice, the other mice were subdivided into pre-implantation (Pre) and mid-pregnancy (Mid) subgroups by injection time. Results All PE-like groups showed hypertension and proteinuria except ApoC3+NS mice only showed hypertension. Serum FFA levels increased significantly except in LPS group compared to controls (P<0.05). LCHAD mRNA and protein expression in the liver and placenta was significantly higher for ApoC3+NS, ApoC3+L-NA and β2GPI mice and lower for L-NA mice than controls (P<0.05) but did not differ between LPS mice and controls. P47phox mRNA and protein expression in the liver significantly increased in all PE-like groups except LPS group, while P47phox expression in the placenta only significantly increased in L-NA and β2GPI groups. Conclusions Abnormal long-chain fatty acid-oxidation may play a different role in different PE-like models and in some cases participate in the pathogenesis of PE through oxidative stress pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2015047016,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has two membrane-bound acetyltransferases responsible for the endoluminal N(ϵ)-lysine acetylation of ER-transiting and -resident proteins. Mutations that impair the ER-based acetylation machinery are associated with developmental defects and a familial form of spastic paraplegia. Deficient ER acetylation in the mouse leads to defects of the immune and nervous system. Here, we report that both ATase1 and ATase2 form homo- and heterodimers and associate with members of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. In contrast to the OST, the ATases only modify correctly folded polypetides. Collectively, our studies suggest that one of the functions of the ATases is to work in concert with the OST and ""select"" correctly folded from unfolded/misfolded transiting polypeptides."

https://openalex.org/W1966608666,"Molecular markers are a highly valuable tool for creating genetic maps. Like in many other crops, sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) breeding is increasingly supported by the application of such genetic markers. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based markers have a high potential for automated analysis and high-throughput genotyping. We developed a bioinformatics workflow that uses Sanger and 2nd-generation sequence data for detection, evaluation and verification of new transcript-associated SNPs from sugar beet. RNAseq data from one parent of an established mapping population were produced by 454-FLX sequencing and compared to Sanger ESTs derived from the other parent. The workflow established for SNP detection considers the quality values of both types of reads, provides polymorphic alignments as well as selection criteria for reliable SNP detection and allows painless generation of new genetic markers within genes. We obtained a total of 14,323 genic SNPs and InDels. According to empirically optimised settings for the quality parameters, we classified these SNPs into four usability categories. Validation of a subset of the in silico detected SNPs by genotyping the mapping population indicated a high success rate of the SNP detection. Finally, a total of 307 new markers were integrated with existing data into a new genetic map of sugar beet which offers improved resolution and the integration of terminal markers."
https://openalex.org/W2074315198,"The cellular response to mitogens is tightly regulated via transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms to rapidly induce genes that promote proliferation and efficiently attenuate their expression to prevent malignant growth. RNase L is an endoribonuclease that mediates diverse antiproliferative activities, and tristetraprolin (TTP) is a mitogen-induced RNA-binding protein that directs the decay of proliferation-stimulatory mRNAs. In light of their roles as endogenous proliferative constraints, we examined the mechanisms and functional interactions of RNase L and TTP to attenuate a mitogenic response. Mitogen stimulation of RNase L-deficient cells significantly increased TTP transcription and the induction of other mitogen-induced mRNAs. This regulation corresponded with elevated expression of serum-response factor (SRF), a master regulator of mitogen-induced transcription. RNase L destabilized the SRF transcript and formed a complex with SRF mRNA in cells providing a mechanism by which RNase L down-regulates SRF-induced genes. TTP and RNase L proteins interacted in cells suggesting that RNase L is directed to cleave TTP-bound RNAs as a mechanism of substrate specificity. Consistent with their concerted function in RNA turnover, the absence of either RNase L or TTP stabilized SRF mRNA, and a subset of established TTP targets was also regulated by RNase L. RNase L deficiency enhanced mitogen-induced proliferation demonstrating its functional role in limiting the mitogenic response. Our findings support a model of feedback regulation in which RNase L and TTP target SRF mRNA and SRF-induced transcripts. Accordingly, meta-analysis revealed an enrichment of RNase L and TTP targets among SRF-regulated genes suggesting that the RNase L/TTP axis represents a viable target to inhibit SRF-driven proliferation in neoplastic diseases."

Pluripotent stem (PS) 2The abbreviations used are: PSpluripotent stemYAPYes-associated proteinLIFleukemia inhibitory factorESembryonic stemiPSinduced PSIαIinter-α-inhibitorECMextracellular matrixHCheavy chain. cells, i.e. embryonic stem (ES) cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, can self-renew indefinitely in culture while retaining the potential to differentiate into any cell type in an organism. To successfully maintain pluripotency and self-renewal, PS cells depend on different signals: Mouse PS (mPS) cells respond to the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and either serum or bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) (reviewed in Ref. 1Chambers I. Smith A. Self-renewal of teratocarcinoma and embryonic stem cells.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7150-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), while human PS (hPS) cells need fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF-β, Activin A) (2Xiao L.

The extracellular matrix has also been proven to be important for PS cells, in particular hPS cells, which depend on either feeder cells or extracellular matrix-derived coating for attachment and subsequent survival in culture. The extracellular environment has been linked to both maintenance and directed differentiation (4Miyazaki T. Futaki S. Suemori H. Taniguchi Y. Yamada M. Kawasaki M. Hayashi M. Kumagai H. Nakatsuji N.

LIF has been described to activate several intracellular pathways in mES cells, namely the JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K, and Src-family pathways (reviewed in Ref. 9Annerén C. Tyrosine kinase signalling in embryonic stem cells.Clin. Sci. 2008; 115: 43-55Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Downstream of these pathways an intricate transcriptional network decides the stem cell fate. Some of these transcriptional factors have been designated as stem-cell markers, e.g. Nanog, Oct3/4, Tfe3, Sox2, and Esrrb (10Betschinger J. Nichols J. Dietmann S. Corrin P.D. Paddison P.J. Smith A. Exit from pluripotency is gated by intracellular redistribution of the bHLH transcription factor Tfe3.Cell. 2013; 153: 335-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In addition, the YAP-TEAD transcription factor complex has been reported to be important for mES cell self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency (11Tamm C. Bower N. Annerén C.

We have shown that LIF signaling through the LIF-receptor activates Yes, which in turn induces nuclear translocation of YAP. Nuclear YAP forms a complex with members of the TEAD transcription factor family (11Tamm C. Bower N. Annerén C.

TEAD/TEF transcription factors utilize the activation domain of YAP65, a Src/Yes-associated protein localized in the cytoplasm.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Yes, YAP, and TEAD2 are highly expressed in self-renewing mES cells and are down-regulated when cells are induced to differentiate. In addition, the Yes kinase has been shown to suppress differentiation and block embryoid body maturation when overexpressed in mES cells (15Zhang X. Meyn 3rd, M.A. Smithgall T.E. c-Yes tyrosine kinase is a potent suppressor of ES cell differentiation and antagonizes the actions of its closest phylogenetic relative, c-Src.ACS chemical biology. 2014; 9: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, TEAD2 can directly associate with the Oct3/4 promoter and activation of the Yes pathway induces, whereas suppression inhibits, Oct3/4 and Nanog promoter activities. In addition to LIF, we have previously demonstrated that Yes can be activated by fetal bovine serum (FBS) but the specific factor(s) in serum responsible for this effect was not identified (13Annerén C. Cowan C.A. Melton D.A. The Src family of tyrosine kinases is important for embryonic stem cell self-renewal.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31590-31598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have successfully isolated and identified Inter-α-inhibitor (IαI) as one of the components in serum capable of activating the Yes-YAP-TEAD pathway in mES cells. The IαI protein family is a group of protein-glycosaminoglycan-protein complexes that are present in plasma at high concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 mg/ml in humans (16Josic D. Brown M.K. Huang F. Lim Y.P. Rucevic M. Clifton J.G. Hixson D.C. Proteomic characterization of inter-α inhibitor proteins from human plasma.Proteomics. 2006; 6: 2874-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). They consist of alternate combinations of heavy chains (HC1-HC5) and a light chain called bikunin linked together by a chondroitin 4-sulfate chain, or as unassembled proteins. IαI is the most abundant family member in human serum and consists of the HC1, HC2, and Bk domains. It is mainly produced by the liver and is considered to be inactive until it reaches the target tissue where it is cleaved by TNF-stimulated gene 6 protein (TSG-6), which in turn forms a transient covalent bond with the HCs and transfers them to hyaluronan (HA), a major constituent of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (17Jessen T.E. Ødum L. Role of tumour necrosis factor stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6) in the coupling of inter-α-trypsin inhibitor to hyaluronan in human follicular fluid.Reproduction. 2003; 125: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Up until recently all medium for culturing mouse and human PS cells have included serum or derivatives thereof, such as Knock-Out Serum Replacement (KOSR) or bovine serum albumin (BSA), and thereby also contain IαI proteins. We here show that IαI purified from human plasma, as well as cleaved HC2, but not HC1, activate the Yes/YAP/TEAD2 pathway and induce expression of the pluripotent stem cell transcription factors Nanog and TEAD target genes Oct3/4, Cyr61, and CTGF.

The E14 and E14/T mES cell lines were cultured on 0,1% gelatin in 10% serum in the absence of feeder cells as previously described (18Smith A. Culture and differentiation of embryonic stem cells.Methods in Cell Science. 1991; 13: 89-94Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, mES cells were plated and grown overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until 70–80% confluence and then serum-starved for 4–24 h in minimal GMEM-based medium (serum-free medium, here-in called “No FBS”) before treatment with different factors. The mES cells were also cultured in 2i medium (19Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A.

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs), human kidney cells HEKBlue, and human liver carcinoma cell line HepG2 were expanded in ATCC-formulated Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. FBS was treated with a mild acetonitrile (ACN) precipitation to separate smaller proteins from its carriers as previously described (22Lei T. He Q.Y. Wang Y.L. Si L.S. Chiu J.F.

The supernatant was diluted into 2 m ammonium sulfate containing binding buffer for a modified Blue-Sepharose chromatography, described previously (23Arakawa T. Tsumoto K. Ejima D. Kita Y.

Methods. 2007; 70: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and eluted using 2 m NaCl (Eluate 1) and 1 m arginine (Eluate 2). The eluted fractions were concentrated and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using Vivaspin 6 columns (GE Healthcare) and then tested for induction of TEAD activity using luciferase assay (described below). Eluate 1 was further purified using Heparin-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) and eluted stepwise with an NaCl gradient. The eluted fractions were again dialyzed against PBS and tested for their ability to induce TEAD-dependent transcription. The isolation of IαI and the heavy chains HC1 and HC2 was performed as described previously (24Blom A.M. Mörgelin M. Oyen M. Jarvet J. Fries E. Structural characterization of inter-α-inhibitor. Evidence for an extended shape.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 298-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, a side fraction from the commercial production of factor IX (Pharmacia-Upjohn, Stockholm, Sweden) was subjected to gel filtration on a HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-400 HR column using the ÄKTA system (both from GE Healthcare), generating more than 95% pure IαI. For the release of the heavy chains, 2 m NaOH treatment followed by anion exchange chromatography (MonoQ 5/50 GL; GE Healthcare) was performed as described before (25Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Analysis of inter-α-trypsin inhibitor and a novel trypsin inhibitor, pre-α-trypsin inhibitor, from human plasma. Polypeptide chain stoichiometry and assembly by glycan.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15975-15981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions were run on an 8% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue followed by mass spectrometry analysis (MS-MALDI-TOF) for assessment of purity. Unless specified differently, protein concentrations were determined by UV measurements and the absorbance coefficients for the protein moieties of IαI, HC1, and HC2 were obtained from Bloom et al. (24Blom A.M. Mörgelin M. Oyen M. Jarvet J. Fries E. Structural characterization of inter-α-inhibitor. Evidence for an extended shape.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 298-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The protein solutions were concentrated and dialyzed against PBS on Vivaspin 20 columns and stored at −20 °C. Protein samples from the purification were loaded on 8% acrylamide gels. The gels were subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue staining and the selected bands were excised and subjected to MS-MALDI TOF analysis (Mass Spectrometry platform, Uppsala University). Luciferase expression constructs (final concentration 1–2 μg DNA/cm2) were introduced into mES cells by transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (LP2000, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, cells were incubated in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), plasmids and LP2000 mixture at 37 °C for 4 h. The transfection was stopped with 10:1 V/V of serum-free medium. The constructs used were pCS GT-IIC-luciferase (GTIIC) (26Jiang S.W. Eberhardt N.L. Involvement of a protein distinct from transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) in mediating human chorionic somatomammotropin gene enhancer function through the GT-IIC enhanson in choriocarcinoma and COS cells.J.

Imao Y. Nishino K. Hattori N. Ohgane J. Yagi S. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Epigenetic regulation of Nanog gene in embryonic stem and trophoblast stem cells.Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and the pCMV β-gal reference plasmid containing a bacterial β-galactosidase gene. The cells were serum-starved for up to 18 h after transfection and exposed for 6 up to 18 h to the different factors. The different samples were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities in a microplate luminometer and photometer reader (Wallac VICTOR 1420 Multilabel Counter; Perkin Elmer). Cells were fixed with cold 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 15 min and then blocked with PBS 0.5% BSA and 0.3% Triton-X100 (Sigma). The cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies anti-YAP (1:300) and anti-Oct3/4 (1:300), and subsequently incubated with Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies and co-stained with Hoechst (DAPI). Coverslips were mounted using fluoromount (Sigma), and analyzed with inverted confocal fluorescent microscopy (LSM700, Zeis). YAP nuclear localization was measured using ImageJ freeware (NIH). Shortly, DAPI staining was used to determine the limits of nuclear localization and Oct3/4 staining confirmed pluripotent stem cell colonies. Relative YAP nuclear staining was calculated by dividing YAP nuclear staining relative to area divided by cytoplasmic staining relative to area. Cells were incubated 15 min with 100 μm Na3VO4 and harvested in lysis buffer as previously described (13Annerén C. Cowan C.A. Melton D.A. The Src family of tyrosine kinases is important for embryonic stem cell self-renewal.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31590-31598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The lysates were sonicated, and total protein concentration was measured using BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). 10 μg anti-Yes antibody (BD Biosciences) or anti-YAP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were coupled to Protein A Dynabeads according to the manufacturer's recommendations using the Immunoprecipitation Dynabeads Protein A kit (Life Technologies) and then incubated end-over-end with 1 mg of protein extract overnight at 4 °C. The bound proteins were eluted in blotting loading buffer containing SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitated fractions and total lysates were run on 7.5% acrylamide gels under denaturing conditions, and the proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-FL membrane (Millipore). The membranes were blotted with anti-phospho-Src family (Tyr-416, 1:500), anti-phopsho tyrosine (P-Tyr100, 1:500), total YAP (1:250), βactin (1:5000), total Yes (1:1000), P-Ser127 YAP (1:1000), or P-Tyr357 YAP (1:500). The membranes were then incubated with Alexa Fluor anti-rabbit 680 (1:1000) and IRDye 800CW anti-mouse (1:1000). Immunosignals were imaged using an Odyssey fluorescent imaging scanner and band intensity quantification was analyzed using Odyssey 2.1 software (LI-COR Biosciences). Total RNA was extracted and purified with Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was reverse-transcribed from 1 μg of total RNA using iScript (Bio-Rad). First-strand cDNAs were amplified by Quantitative real-time PCR using the Miniopticon Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad), SsoFast Evagreen Supermix and specific primers. The average Ct value for each gene was normalized against GAPDH or 18 S ribosomal RNA (18 S) gene expression and the comparative Ct value (fold change) was calculated using 2−ΔΔC(t). Transcript level comparison was based on primer efficiency estimated from five-point dilution curves and used for comparative Ct computation according to the PFAFFL method (28Pfaffl M.W. A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25504) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR the first-strand cDNAs were amplified using the SsoFast Evagreen Supermix (Bio-Rad) and specific primers. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel with GelRed (Biotum) staining, and photographed using the UVP BioImaging system (Bio-Rad). The PCR primers used are: mouse HC1 (forward: aggctgacgttcgggctcgt, reverse: ggcccagagcctctccacatga), mouse HC2 (forward: agtgatcttgtggaactggcccca, reverse: acagtgtccgtctcctctccgg), mouse TSG-6 (forward: cgtccacggctttgtaggaagatac, reverse: agcctccagccgtgacggat), mouse Oct3/4 (forward: gatgctgtgagcccaaggcaag, reverse: ggctcctgatcaacagcatcac), mouse Nanog (forward: ctttcacctattaaggtgcttgc, reverse: tggcat cggttcatcatggtac), mouse Cyr61 (forward: cagctc actgaagaggcttcct, reverse: gcgtgcagagggttgaaaa), mouse CTGF (forward: cttctgcgatttcggctcc, reverse: tacaccgacccaccgaaga), mouse 18 S (forward: agtccctgccctttgtacaca, reverse: gatccga- gggcctcactaaac), human HC1 (forward: gcctggtgttatcctgagcc, reverse: cggggttcagcgtaatgttc), human HC2 (forward: ctcacctaaagcccacggac, reverse: ggcttctcagggtcctttcc), human TSG-6 (forward: aagcacggtctggcaaatacaagc, reverse: atccatccagcagcacagacatga), human GAPDH (forward: gaaggtgaaggtcggagtc, reverse: gaagatggtgatgggatttc). Experiments were performed at least in three independent experiments, and data are presented as mean ± S.E. When applicable, statistical analysis was done using One-way ANOVA with Dunnett's test on GraphPad Prism version 5.00d for Mac (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), * = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.001, and *** = p < 0.001. We have previously shown that FBS induces auto-phosphorylation activity of the Src-family member Yes (13Annerén C. Cowan C.A. Melton D.A. The Src family of tyrosine kinases is important for embryonic stem cell self-renewal.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31590-31598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine whether FBS also activates TEAD-dependent transcription, mES cells were transfected with a reporter gene construct expressing the firefly luciferase gene driven by the human chorionic somatomammotropin (CS) promoter with multiple (24Blom A.M. Mörgelin M. Oyen M. Jarvet J. Fries E. Structural characterization of inter-α-inhibitor. Evidence for an extended shape.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 298-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) copies of the TEAD-binding GTIIC enhanson (pGTIIC-Luc), as previously described (11Tamm C. Bower N. Annerén C. Regulation of mouse embryonic stem cell self-renewal by a Yes-YAP-TEAD2 signaling pathway downstream of LIF.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The TEAD-binding enhanson region binds all four TEAD family transcription factors (TEAD1-TEAD4) and therefore measures induction of TEAD family-dependent transcription (26Jiang S.W. Eberhardt N.L. Involvement of a protein distinct from transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) in mediating human chorionic somatomammotropin gene enhancer function through the GT-IIC enhanson in choriocarcinoma and COS cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13906-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we demonstrated only minimal luciferase activity in mES cells transfected with the control luciferase construct containing only the CS promoter (11Tamm C. Bower N. Annerén C. Regulation of mouse embryonic stem cell self-renewal by a Yes-YAP-TEAD2 signaling pathway downstream of LIF.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). After transfection, the mES cells were serum and LIF-starved, stimulated with increasing concentrations of FBS and harvested at different time points. The TEAD-dependent luciferase expression was subsequently analyzed. Total protein values were used to normalize luciferase levels. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, FBS significantly activates TEAD-dependent transcription in a dose and time-dependent manner. The highest TEAD activity was achieved with 5% FBS and for 6-h exposure time, and therefore all subsequent experiments to assess activation of TEAD-dependent transcription were performed using these conditions, unless stated otherwise. BMP4 can replace FBS in mES cell cultures (29Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. BMP induction of Id proteins suppresses differentiation and sustains embryonic stem cell self-renewal in collaboration with STAT3.Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that YAP binds to SMAD1 in response to BMP signaling and contributes to mES cell maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency by inducing Id gene transcription (30Varelas X. Sakuma R. Samavarchi-Tehrani P. Peerani R. Rao B.M. Dembowy J. Yaffe M.B. Zandstra P.W. Wrana J.L. TAZ controls Smad nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and regulates human embryonic stem-cell self-renewal.Nature Cell Biology. 2008; 10: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered BMP4 as a potential component of serum capable of activating TEAD transcription. However, BMP4 did not induce TEAD-dependent transcription. Moreover, the addition of the BMP inhibitor Noggin did not inhibit the capacity of FBS to induce TEAD, suggesting that another factor present in serum activates TEAD-dependent transcription (Fig. 1C). To assess whether the TEAD activity could be induced by other growth factors present in serum, we tested a panel of commercially available growth factors for their ability to affect TEAD family-dependent transcription, in serum-starved cells. However, no noticeable effect on TEAD-dependent transcription was detected after stimulation with the different factors, except for EGF, which caused a small yet insignificant increase in TEAD dependent-transcription (Fig. 1D). Because none of the tested growth factors affected TEAD-dependent transcription, a reverse approach was initiated with the aim of isolating and identifying one or more components in serum that can induce TEAD-dependent transcription. Thus, FBS was separated by chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the eluted fractions were tested for their ability to induce TEAD-dependent transcription. Mouse ES cells co-transfected with pGTIIC-Luc and pCMV β-gal constructs were then serum- and LIF-starved and subsequently stimulated with the eluted fractions. The luciferase activity was normalized to the β-gal transcription level to remove transfection rate variations between samples and overall activation induced by the complex mix of growth factors, cytokines, and other molecules present in FBS. The fractions were also separated with SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue to assess protein content. Fig. 2A shows the stained gels and the respective fraction's ability to induce TEAD-dependent transcription. Eluate 1 from the first Blue-Sepharose chromatography step was found to induce the highest level of TEAD activation, and was therefore used for further separation by heparin chromatography. The eluted fractions were again analyzed for TEAD-dependent activation as described above (Fig. 2B). By correlating band intensity with lucifer"
https://openalex.org/W2017094092,"A new type of pyoderma was detected in Finnish fur animals in 2007. The disease continues to spread within and between farms, with severe and potentially fatal symptoms. It compromises animal welfare and causes considerable economic losses to farmers. A case-control study was performed in 2010-2011 to describe the entity and to identify the causative agent. Altogether 99 fur animals were necropsied followed by pathological and microbiological examination. The data indicated that the disease clinically manifests in mink (Neovison vison) by necrotic dermatitis of the feet and facial skin. In finnraccoons (Nyctereutes procyonoides), it causes painful abscesses in the paws. Foxes (Vulpes lagopus) are affected by severe conjunctivitis and the infection rapidly spreads to the eyelids and facial skin. A common finding at necropsy was necrotic pyoderma. Microbiological analysis revealed the presence of a number of potential causative agents, including a novel Streptococcus sp. The common finding from all diseased animals of all species was Arcanobacterium phocae. This bacterium has previously been isolated from marine mammals with skin lesions but this is the first report of A. phocae isolated in fur animals with pyoderma. The results obtained from this study implicate A. phocae as a potential causative pathogen of fur animal epidemic necrotic pyoderma (FENP) and support observations that the epidemic may have originated in a species-shift of the causative agent from marine mammals. The variable disease pattern and the presence of other infectious agents (in particular the novel Streptococcus sp.) suggest a multifactorial etiology for FENP, and further studies are needed to determine the environmental, immunological and infectious factors contributing to the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2067527713,"Understanding the spatial characteristics of dengue fever (DF) incidences is crucial for governmental agencies to implement effective disease control strategies. We investigated the associations between environmental and socioeconomic factors and DF geographic distribution, are proposed a probabilistic risk assessment approach that uses threshold-based quantile regression to identify the significant risk factors for DF transmission and estimate the spatial distribution of DF risk regarding full probability distributions. To interpret risk, return period was also included to characterize the frequency pattern of DF geographic occurrences. The study area included old Kaohsiung City and Fongshan District, two areas in Taiwan that have been affected by severe DF infections in recent decades. Results indicated that water-related facilities, including canals and ditches, and various types of residential area, as well as the interactions between them, were significant factors that elevated DF risk. By contrast, the increase of per capita income and its associated interactions with residential areas mitigated the DF risk in the study area. Nonlinear associations between these factors and DF risk were present in various quantiles, implying that water-related factors characterized the underlying spatial patterns of DF, and high-density residential areas indicated the potential for high DF incidence (e.g., clustered infections). The spatial distributions of DF risks were assessed in terms of three distinct map presentations: expected incidence rates, incidence rates in various return periods, and return periods at distinct incidence rates. These probability-based spatial risk maps exhibited distinct DF risks associated with environmental factors, expressed as various DF magnitudes and occurrence probabilities across Kaohsiung, and can serve as a reference for local governmental agencies."
https://openalex.org/W2021789303,"Background Despite the large number of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) cases in China, few studies have comprehensively analyzed the drug resistance-associated gene mutations and genotypes in relation to the clinical characteristics of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates. Methodology/Principal Findings We thus analyzed the phenotypic and genotypic drug resistance profiles of 115 Mtb clinical isolates recovered from a tuberculosis referral hospital in Beijing, China. We also performed genotyping by 28 loci MIRU-VNTR analysis. Socio-demographic and clinical data were retrieved from medical records and analyzed. In total, 78 types of mutations (including 42 previously reported and 36 newly identified ones) were identified in 115 Mtb clinical isolates. There was significant correlation between phenotypic and genotypic drug resistance rates for first-line anti-TB drugs (P<0.001). Genotyping revealed 101 MIRU-VNTR types, with 20 isolates (17.4%) being clustered and 95 isolates (82.6%) having unique genotypes. Higher proportion of re-treatment cases was observed among patients with clustered isolates than those with unique MIRU-VNTR genotypes (75.0% vs. 41.1%). Moreover, clinical epidemiological links were identified among patients infected by Mtb strains belonging to the same clusters, suggesting a potential of transmission among patients. Conclusions/Significance Our study provided information on novel potential drug resistance-associated mutations in Mtb. In addition, the genotyping data from our study suggested that enforcement of the implementation of genotyping in diagnostic routines would provide important information for better monitor and control of TB transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2015887003,"The impact of exogenic testosterone (T): 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg.bw) and 19-nortestosterone 17-decanoate (ND): 1.5 and 7.5 mg/kg.bw) in castrated male rats was evaluated based on: (a) weight increase of the androgen target tissues, respecting the Hershberger methodology; (b) the 17α and β-testosterone, 17 α and β-estradiol and 17 α and β-nortestosterone levels using the GC-MS/MS technique; and (c) observation of the serum free thyroxine levels (T4). Results revealed that T and ND significantly increased the weight of androgen target tissues as follows: ND was more influential on seminal vesicles, levator ani-bulbocavernosus muscle (LABC) and Cowper's glands and T (at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg.bw) influenced the weight of the ventral prostate and glans penis. Serum samples analyzed for steroid hormone levels showed the presence of 17β-testosterone, 17β-estradiol and 17β-nor-testosterone, in castrated male rats injected with testosterone and nortestosterone, but no significant differences were found between thyroid responses and thyroid hormone levels. The results of this research proved the disrupting activity of T and ND when administered in high doses and the useful application of the Hershberger bioassay in the case of ND."
https://openalex.org/W2053352335,"Background Studies in populations unexposed to folic acid (FA) fortification have demonstrated that MTHFR C677T polymorphism is associated with increased risk of higher grades of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2+). However, it is unknown whether exposure to higher folate as a result of the FA fortification program has altered the association between MTHFR C677T and risk of CIN, or the mechanisms involved with such alterations. The current study investigated the following in a FA fortified population: 1) The association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and risk of CIN 2+; 2) The modifying effects of plasma folate concentrations on this association; and 3) The modifying effects of plasma folate on the association between the polymorphism and degree of methylation of long interspersed nucleotide elements (L1s), in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA, a documented biomarker of CIN risk. Methods The study included 457 US women diagnosed with either CIN 2+ (cases) or ≤ CIN 1 (non-cases). Unconditional logistic regression models were used to test the associations after adjusting for relevant risk factors for CIN. Results The 677CT/TT MTHFR genotypes were not associated with the risk of CIN 2+. Women with CT/TT genotype with lower folate, however, were more likely to be diagnosed with CIN 2+ compared to women with CT/TT genotype with higher folate (OR = 2.41, P = 0.030). Women with CT/TT genotype with lower folate were less likely to have a higher degree of PBMC L1 methylation compared to women with CT/TT genotype with higher folate (OR = 0.28, P = 0.017). Conclusions This study provides the first evidence that the MTHFR 677CT/TT genotype-associated lower degree of PBMC L1 methylation increases the risk of CIN 2+ in women in the US post-FA fortification era. Thus, even in the post-FA fortification era, not all women have adequate folate status to overcome MTHFR 677CT/TT genotype-associated lower degree of L1 methylation."
https://openalex.org/W2092127860,"The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase functions as a central node in the DNA damage response signaling network. The mechanisms by which ATR activity is amplified and/or maintained are not understood. Here we demonstrate that BRIT1/microcephalin (MCPH1), a human disease-related protein, is dispensable for the initiation but essential for the amplification of ATR signaling. BRIT1 interacts with and recruits topoisomerase-binding protein 1 (TopBP1), a key activator of ATR signaling, to the sites of DNA damage. Notably, replication stress-induced ataxia telangiectasia-mutated or ATR-dependent BRIT1 phosphorylation at Ser-322 facilitates efficient TopBP1 recruitment. These results reveal a mechanism that ensures the continuation of ATR-initiated DNA damage signaling. Our study uncovers a previously unknown regulatory axis of ATR signaling in maintaining genomic integrity, which may provide mechanistic insights into the perturbation of ATR signaling in human diseases such as neurodevelopmental defects and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2073163071,"In this study we explored the mode of action of KR-72, a 9-O-butyl-13-(4-isopropylbenzyl)berberine derivative previously shown to exhibit potent antifungal activity against a variety of human fungal pathogens. The DNA microarray data revealed that KR-72 treatment significantly changed the transcription profiles of C. neoformans, affecting the expression of more than 2,000 genes. Genes involved in translation and transcription were mostly upregulated, whereas those involved in the cytoskeleton, intracellular trafficking, and lipid metabolism were downregulated. KR-72 also exhibited a strong synergistic effect with the antifungal agent FK506. KR-72 treatment regulated the expression of several essential genes, including ECM16, NOP14, HSP10 and MGE1, which are required for C. neoformans growth. The KR-72-mediated induction of MGE1 also likely reduced the viability of C. neoformans by impairing cell cycle or the DNA repair system. In conclusion, KR-72 showed antifungal activity by modulating diverse biological processes through a mode of action distinct from those of clinically available antifungal drugs such as polyene and azole drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2082875823,"It has been hypothesized in the literature that exposure to extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (50 or 60 Hz) may lead to human health effects such as childhood leukemia or brain tumors. In a previous study investigating multiple types of cells from brain and kidney of the mouse (Acta Neuropathologica 2004; 107: 257-264), we found increased unrepaired nuclear DNA single strand breaks (nDNA SSB) only in epithelial cells of the choroid plexus in the brain using autoradiographic methods after a continuous eight-week 50 Hz magnetic field (MF) exposure of adult mice with flux density of 1.5 mT.In the present study we tested the hypothesis that MF exposure with lower flux densities (0.1 mT, i.e., the actual exposure limit for the population in most European countries, and 1.0 mT) shows similar results to those in the previous study. Experiments and data analysis were carried out in a similar way as in our previous study.Continuous eight-week 50 Hz MF exposure with 0.1 mT or 1.0 mT did not result in increased persisting unrepaired nDNA SSB in distinct types of cells in the brain, kidney, and liver of adult mice. MF exposure with 1.0 mT led to reduced unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in epithelial cells in the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle in the brain (EC-CP) and epithelial cells of the cortical collecting duct in the kidney, as well as to reduced mtDNA synthesis in neurons of the caudate nucleus in the brain and in EC-CP.No evidence was found for increased persisting unrepaired nDNA SSB in distinct types of cells in the brain, kidney, and liver of adult mice after continuous eight-week 50 Hz magnetic field exposure with flux density of 0.1 mT or 1.0 mT."
