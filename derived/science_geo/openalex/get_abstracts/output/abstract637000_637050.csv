To understand their cell type specificities and pathways of action, we generate an atlas of 366,650 cells from the colon mucosa of 18 UC patients and 12 healthy individuals, revealing 51 epithelial, stromal, and immune cell subsets, including BEST4+ enterocytes, microfold-like cells, and IL13RA2+IL11+ inflammatory fibroblasts, which we associate with resistance to anti-TNF treatment. Inflammatory fibroblasts, inflammatory monocytes, microfold-like cells, and T cells that co-express CD8 and IL-17 expand with disease, forming intercellular interaction hubs. Many UC risk genes are cell type specific and co-regulated within relatively few gene modules, suggesting convergence onto limited sets of cell types and pathways. Using this observation, we nominate and infer functions for specific risk genes across GWAS loci. Our work provides a framework for interrogating complex human diseases and mapping risk variants to cell types and pathways.

Our work provides a framework for interrogating complex human diseases and mapping risk variants to cell types and pathways. Tissues function through the coordinated actions of diverse epithelial, immune, and stromal cell types. Breakdown in any compartment can lead to disease, either because of intrinsic cell dysfunction or the compensatory actions of other cells attempting to restore homeostasis. This interplay can make it difficult to nominate the causal mechanisms that underlie disease. In the specific case of the colonic mucosa, disruptions can lead to ulcerative colitis (UC), a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Xavier and Podolsky, 2007Xavier R.J. Podolsky D.K. Unravelling the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.Nature. 2007; 448: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (3255) Google Scholar). Known disease risk alleles highlight key pathways in the pathogenesis of IBD, including innate and adaptive immunity, gut barrier function, and pathogen sensing and response (Liu et al., 2015Liu J.Z. van Sommeren S.

Moreover, although histological analysis following endoscopy is the current standard of care (Magro et al., 2017Magro F. Gionchetti P. Eliakim R. Ardizzone S. Armuzzi A. Barreiro-de Acosta M. Burisch J. Gecse K.B. Hart A.L. Hindryckx P. et al.European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation [ECCO]Third European Evidence-based Consensus on Diagnosis and Management of Ulcerative Colitis.

Crohn’s Colitis. 2017; 11: 649-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar), it fails to capture fine details of disease—e.g., cell proportions, cell type-specific expression, and cell-cell interactions—and does not distinguish between pathways associated with chronic inflammation versus disease restitution. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is helping to advance our understanding of human disease by comprehensively mapping the cell types and states within a tissue, disentangling changes in the expression of gene programs from those in cell frequencies, and connecting them through cell-cell interactions (Tanay and Regev, 2017Tanay A. Regev A. Scaling single-cell genomics from phenomenology to mechanism.Nature. 2017; 541: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Here we apply scRNA-seq to UC, using intestinal biopsies collected from healthy individuals and UC patients to generate and query a single-cell atlas of the healthy and diseased colon. We generated 366,650 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes from 68 biopsies (each ∼2.4 mm2) from colonoscopic examinations of 18 UC patients under different treatment regimens and 12 healthy individuals (Figure 1A; STAR Methods; Table S1). We conducted the study in two phases: 115,517 single-cell profiles were collected from 34 colon biopsies of 7 UC patients and 10 healthy individuals as a training set (Figure 1A; STAR Methods; Table S1); another 251,133 were then collected from 34 biopsies of 11 UC patients and 2 healthy individuals as a test set. To investigate the transitions between healthy and chronically inflamed mucosa while mitigating patient-specific variability, we collected paired samples from each subject in a single procedure. For UC patients, these were endoscopically assessed as adjacent normal tissue (“non-inflamed”) and inflamed or ulcerated tissue (“inflamed”) (Figure 1A; STAR Methods). To estimate intra-subject variation, we obtained two location-matched samples (distance of ∼1–2 cm) from each of the 12 healthy subjects as well as from both non-inflamed and inflamed regions of 3 UC patients. We then separated the “epithelial” (EPI) and “lamina propria” (LP) fractions from each sample and performed scRNA-seq (STAR Methods). We confirmed that expression of an inflammation-associated gene set increased from healthy to non-inflamed to inflamed samples (Figure 1B). The single-cell profiles partitioned into 51 subsets by clustering (Figure 1C, after correction for technical and biological variation; STAR Methods), which we annotated by known markers (Figure 1D). The subsets were robust and reproducible because nearly all were represented by all specimens (Figure 1E) and proportionally distributed across patients (Figures S1A and S1B). The discovery and validation cohorts were highly congruent (Figures S1B–S1D), as were replicates collected from the same and even different individuals within the same disease state (Figure S1E; STAR Methods). The 51 subsets include 15 epithelial subsets, ordered along the differentiation trajectory from intestinal stem cells (ISCs) to mature cell fates (Haber et al., 2017Haber A.L. Biton M. Rogel N. Herbst R.H. Shekhar K. Smillie C. Burgin G. Delorey T.M. Howitt M.R. Katz Y. et al.A single-cell survey of the small intestinal epithelium.Nature. 2017; 551: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar; Figure 1F; STAR Methods). They also include 8 fibroblast, 4 endothelial cell, 1 glial cell, 7 myeloid cell, 4 B cell, 10 T cell (CD4+ conventional T helper cell [Tconv], regulatory T [Treg], CD8+, and γδ), 1 innate lymphoid cell (ILC), and 1 natural killer (NK) cell subsets (Figure 1C). Missing cell types include submucosal enteric neurons, which require isolation by single-nucleus RNA-seq (Habib et al., 2016Habib N. Li Y. Heidenreich M. Swiech L. Avraham-Davidi I. Trombetta J.J.

Div-Seq: Single-nucleus RNA-Seq reveals dynamics of rare adult newborn neurons.Science. 2016; 353: 925-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs), and neutrophils (Schelker et al., 2017Schelker M. Feau S. Du J. Ranu N. Klipp E. MacBeath G. Schoeberl B. Raue A. Estimation of immune cell content in tumour tissue using single-cell RNA-seq data.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Each subset is supported by known and novel markers (Figure 1D; Table S2), including transcription factors (TFs), G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and cytokines (Figures S2A–S2C; Table S3). In most cases, further sub-clusters could not be distinguished by an additional round of clustering (Table S2; STAR Methods). Exceptions included immunoglobulin A (IgA)+ and IgG+ plasma cells, and Treg cells co-expressing TNFRSF4/OX40 and TNFRSF18/GITR, which may reflect activated versus resting Treg cells. Our census revealed that enterocytes expressing BEST4 are distinct from other epithelial cells (Parikh et al., 2019Parikh K. Antanaviciute A. Fawkner-Corbett D. Jagielowicz M. Aulicino A. Lagerholm C. Davis S. Kinchen J. Chen H.H. Alham N.K. et al.Colonic epithelial cell diversity in health and inflammatory bowel disease.Nature. 2019; 567: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and are enriched in genes related to pH sensing and electrolyte balance (validated in situ; Figures 1G, 1H, and S1D). These include the otopetrins 2 and 3 (OTOP2/3), proton channels that detect pH and underlie sour taste perception (Tu et al., 2018Tu Y.H. Cooper A.J. Teng B. Chang R.B. Artiga D.J. Turner H.N. Mulhall E.M. Ye W. Smith A.D. Liman E.R. An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels.Science. 2018; 359: 1047-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar); carbonic anhydrase VII (CA7), which catalyzes bicarbonate formation; and bestrophin-4 (BEST4), which may export bicarbonate (Qu and Hartzell, 2008Qu Z. Hartzell H.C. Bestrophin Cl- channels are highly permeable to HCO3-.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C1371-C1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). BEST4+ enterocytes comprised ∼1% of the ileal epithelium from two Crohn’s disease (CD) patients (11,473 cells; data not shown). Multiple fibroblast subsets differ by expression of WNT/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling genes, likely reflecting distinct positions along the crypt-villus axis (Powell et al., 2011Powell D.W. Pinchuk I.V. Saada J.I. Chen X. Mifflin R.C. Mesenchymal cells of the intestinal lamina propria.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2011; 73: 213-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, Shoshkes-Carmel et al., 2018Shoshkes-Carmel M. Wang Y.J. Wangensteen K.J. Tóth B. Kondo A. Massasa E.E. Itzkovitz S. Kaestner K.H. Subepithelial telocytes are an important source of Wnts that supports intestinal crypts.Nature. 2018; 557: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Some are enriched for WNT2B, WNT4, and DKK3, suggesting that they reside near the crypt, whereas others are enriched for BMP4, BMP5, and WNT5A/B and may reside near the villus (Figure 1I). Many of these genes are reported markers of subepithelial telocytes, a rare population of fibroblasts that support the epithelium (Shoshkes-Carmel et al., 2018Shoshkes-Carmel M. Wang Y.J. Wangensteen K.J. Tóth B. Kondo A. Massasa E.E. Itzkovitz S. Kaestner K.H. Subepithelial telocytes are an important source of Wnts that supports intestinal crypts.Nature. 2018; 557: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar); however, in our data, they are broadly distributed across all subsets (e.g., FOXL1, DKK3, and WNT5B; Figure 1I). One subset of WNT2B+ fibroblasts may support the ISC niche by expression of R-spondin-3 (validated in situ, Figures 1G–1I), which interacts with the ISC receptor LGR5 (de Lau et al., 2011de Lau W. Barker N. Low T.Y. Koo B.K. Li V.S. Teunissen H. Kujala P. Haegebarth A. Peters P.J. van de Wetering M. et al.Lgr5 homologues associate with Wnt receptors and mediate R-spondin signalling.Nature. 2011; 476: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). RSPO3+ fibroblasts express other WNT/BMP signaling genes and several distinct chemokines (Figures 1G and 1I), which may recruit immune cells to the ISC niche (Biton et al., 2018Biton M. Haber A.L. Rogel N. Burgin G. Beyaz S. Schnell A. Ashenberg O. Su C.W. Smillie C.

They are also enriched for genes predictive of poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) (Calon et al., 2015Calon A. Lonardo E. Berenguer-Llergo A. Espinet E. Hernando-Momblona X. Iglesias M. Sevillano M. Palomo-Ponce S. Tauriello D.V. Byrom D. et al.Stromal gene expression defines poor-prognosis subtypes in colorectal cancer.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) and may support tumor growth by promoting a stem-like microenvironment (Figure S5A). The proportions of many cell subsets significantly differed in non-inflamed or inflamed samples versus healthy controls, using both a multivariate test accounting for compositional dependencies (Figure 2A) and univariate tests (Figures S3A and S3B; STAR Methods). These include many known changes in UC patients, such as increases in the proportions of mast cells (King et al., 1992King T. Biddle W. Bhatia P. Moore J. Miner Jr., P.B. Colonic mucosal mast cell distribution at line of demarcation of active ulcerative colitis.Dig. Dis. Sci. 1992; 37: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), CD8+IL-17+ T cells (Tom et al., 2016Tom M.R. Li J. Ueno A. Fort Gasia M. Chan R. Hung D.Y. Chenoo S. Iacucci M. Jijon H.B.

IAFs that express WNT2B+ markers typically do not express WNT5B+ markers (and vice versa). Microfold (M) cells are typically associated with lymphoid tissue in the human small intestine, where they are important for recognition of the gut microbiota (Mabbott et al., 2013Mabbott N.A. Donaldson D.S. Ohno H. Williams I.R. Mahajan A. Microfold (M) cells: important immunosurveillance posts in the intestinal epithelium.Mucosal Immunol. 2013; 6: 666-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In the colon, M-like cells were rarely found in healthy individuals but expanded 17-fold during inflammation (validated in situ; Figures S3A and S3D). They highly express several chemokines (e.g., CCL20 and CCL23; Figure 1G), suggesting involvement in recruiting immune cells to sites of inflammation. Mucus layer defects (Xavier and Podolsky, 2007Xavier R.J. Podolsky D.K. Unravelling the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.Nature. 2007; 448: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (3255) Google Scholar) were not explained by changes in expression (below), suggesting that they may arise post-transcriptionally. Although the frequency of goblet cells did not change, goblet cell progenitors were reduced during inflammation, both as a discrete cell subset (Figure 2A) and along the continuum of differentiation (Figures 1F and 2D; STAR Methods). Although the overall number of immune cells increased with disease (Danese and Fiocchi, 2011Danese S. Fiocchi C. Ulcerative colitis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 365: 1713-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar), within the B cell lineage, there was a shift from plasma to follicular (FO) cells (validated in situ; Figures 2A and 2B). Among plasma cells, the frequencies of IgA+ relative to IgG+ cells decreased (Figure S3C), suggesting that inflammation is associated with immunoglobulin class switching (Scott et al., 1986Scott M.G. Nahm M.H. Macke K. Nash G.S. Bertovich M.J. MacDermott R.P. Spontaneous secretion of IgG subclasses by intestinal mononuclear cells: differences between ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and controls.Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1986; 66: 209-215PubMed Google Scholar). Although most fibroblast subsets were present in both healthy individuals and UC patients, a subset we termed inflammation-associated fibroblasts (IAFs) expanded 189-fold in inflamed tissue of some patients (>1% of LP cells, validated in situ; Figures 2A and 2C). IAFs are enriched for expression of many genes associated with colitis, fibrosis, and cancer, including IL11, IL24, and IL13RA2 (Figure 1G). Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a regulator of fibrosis in mice and potentially humans (Schafer et al., 2017Schafer S. Viswanathan S. Widjaja A.A. Lim W.W. Moreno-Moral A. DeLaughter D.M. Ng B. Patone G. Chow K. Khin E. et al.IL-11 is a crucial determinant of cardiovascular fibrosis.Nature. 2017; 552: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). IAFs comprise WNT2B+ and WNT5B+ subsets (Figure S3E), suggesting that they may reflect a distinct state along the crypt-villus axis. IAFs express markers of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) (Figure 1G), including FAP, TWIST1, and WNT2 (Erez et al., 2010Erez N. Truitt M. Olson P. Arron S.T. Hanahan D.

Crncec I. et al.Autocrine WNT2 signaling in fibroblasts promotes colorectal cancer progression.Oncogene. 2017; 36: 5460-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The expression levels of IAF markers are correlated between IAFs and 414 bulk RNA-seq CRC samples (Cancer Genome Atlas, 2012Cancer Genome Atlas NetworkComprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer.Nature. 2012; 487: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (5937) Google Scholar; Figure S5B; Spearman’s ρ = 0.67), more than controls (ρ = 0.33; p < 10−10; Mann-Whitney test), suggesting an expansion of IAFs in tumors (also consistent with increased expression of IAF markers in CRC versus controls; Figure S5B). To identify changes in expression associated with disease, we modeled expression as the sum of components reflecting cell subset, disease state (healthy, non-inflamed, or inflamed), and technical covariates while correcting for ambient RNA contamination (Macosko et al., 2015Macosko E.Z. Basu A. Satija R. Nemesh J. Shekhar K. Goldman M. Tirosh I. Bialas A.R. Kamitaki N.

We distinguished between changes shared across cell subsets in epithelial, innate, or adaptive compartments (Figures 3A–3C and S4A–S4C, Table S4) and those unique to each subset (Figures 3D–3F and S4D–S4F; Table S4; STAR Methods).Figure S4Cell- and Lineage-Specific Expression Changes in Inflamed versus Non-Inflamed Tissues, Related to Figure 3Show full captionVolcano plots of genes that are differentially expressed in inflamed cells relative to non-inflamed cells, showing the effect size in inflammation (i.e., discrete DE coefficient, x axis) and statistical significance (y axis).

(D-F) Unique changes that were specific to cell subsets within these compartments. Selected genes are highlighted, all genes are reported in Table S4. Despite their endoscopic assessments, non-inflamed and inflamed tissue had similar differentially expressed (DE) gene signatures (Figure 3G; Table S4), suggesting that the transcriptional signature of UC precedes inflammation or persists after resolution. Across epithelial cells, DE genes reflect attempts to restore homeostasis by activating innate immunity, such as antimicrobial and antioxidant defense pathways, mucin biosynthesis, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II machinery (validated in situ; Figures 3A, 3D, and 3H; Biton et al., 2018Biton M.

Within the stroma, fibroblasts induced genes for inflammation, fibrosis, and tissue repair (Gieseck et al., 2018Gieseck 3rd, R.L. Wilson M.S. Wynn T.A. Type 2 immunity in tissue repair and fibrosis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), whereas changes in endothelial cells supported tissue vascularization (Figures 3B and 3E). Among immune cells, myeloid and T cells activated co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory genes, and B cells upregulated genes for IgG class switching and affinity maturation (Figures 3C and 3F). Comparison between non-inflamed and inflamed UC tissue (Figures S4A–S4F; Table S4) revealed several metabolic changes in epithelial cells accompanying inflammation. For example, changes in purine metabolism (e.g., XDH and URAD) may yield uric acid, associated with epithelial damage (Chiaro et al., 2017Chiaro T.R. Soto R. Zac Stephens W. Kubinak J.L. Petersen C. Gogokhia L. Bell R. Delgado J.C. Cox J. Voth W. et al.A member of the gut mycobiota modulates host purine metabolism exacerbating colitis in mice.Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9 (eaaf9044)Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells also induced the kynurenine pathway (Figure 4A), associated with disease severity (Sofia et al., 2018Sofia M.A. Ciorba M.A. Meckel K. Lim C.K. Guillemin G.J. Weber C.R. Bissonnette M. Pekow J.R. Tryptophan Metabolism through the Kynurenine Pathway is Associated with Endoscopic Inflammation in Ulcerative Colitis.Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2018; 24: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). GPR35, a kynurenic acid receptor, is a putative risk gene (Huang et al., 2017Huang H. Fang M. Jostins L. Umićević Mirkov M. Boucher G. Anderson C.A. Andersen V. Cleynen I. Cortes A. Crins F. et al.International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics ConsortiumFine-mapping inflammatory bowel disease loci to single-variant resolution.Nature. 2017; 547: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Mapping changes in 239 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways during inflammation (Figures 4B and S5C; STAR Methods) revealed other metabolic alterations in enterocytes, including a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, induction of arginine biosynthesis enzymes (e.g., NOS2 and ASS1), and downregulation of enzymes for the degradation of branched-chain amino acids, particularly AUH, a putative risk gene (Liu et al., 2015Liu J.Z. van Sommeren S. Huang H. Ng S.C. Alberts R. Takahashi A. Ripke S. Lee J.C. Jostins L. Shah T. et al.International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics ConsortiumInternational IBD Genetics ConsortiumAssociation analyses identify 38 susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease and highlight shared genetic risk across populations.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Enterocytes also induced HIF1 pathways, a contributor to the glycolytic shift in monocytes (Kelly and O’Neill, 2015Kelly B. O’Neill L.A. Metabolic reprogramming in macrophages and dendritic cells in innate immunity.Cell Res. 2015; 25: 771-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar).

Among T cells, several CD4+ subsets upregulated IL17A (Figure 3C), which may reflect both a per-cell increase in IL17A expression as well as an expansion of Th17 cells. Surprisingly, a CD8+ subset had the strongest overall induction of IL17A across both disease states (Figures 4C–4E). In situ analysis revealed both CD4− and CD4+ cells that co-express CD8 and IL17A (Figures 4D and 4E). Although CD8+IL-17+ T cells have been reported (Cortez et al., 2014Cortez V.S.

https://openalex.org/W2803095812,"The roles of different nodes within a network are often understood through centrality analysis, which aims to quantify the capacity of a node to influence, or be influenced by, other nodes via its connection topology. Many different centrality measures have been proposed, but the degree to which they offer unique information, and whether it is advantageous to use multiple centrality measures to define node roles, is unclear. Here we calculate correlations between 17 different centrality measures across 212 diverse real-world networks, examine how these correlations relate to variations in network density and global topology, and investigate whether nodes can be clustered into distinct classes according to their centrality profiles. We find that centrality measures are generally positively correlated to each other, the strength of these correlations varies across networks, and network modularity plays a key role in driving these cross-network variations. Data-driven clustering of nodes based on centrality profiles can distinguish different roles, including topological cores of highly central nodes and peripheries of less central nodes. Our findings illustrate how network topology shapes the pattern of correlations between centrality measures and demonstrate how a comparative approach to network centrality can inform the interpretation of nodal roles in complex networks."

Mucin 1 kidney disease (MKD) results from a frameshift mutation in the MUC1 gene (MUC1-fs). Here, we show that MKD is a toxic proteinopathy. Intracellular MUC1-fs accumulation activated the ATF6 unfolded protein response (UPR) branch. We identified BRD4780, a small molecule that clears MUC1-fs from patient cells, from kidneys of knockin mice and from patient kidney organoids. MUC1-fs is trapped in TMED9 cargo receptor-containing vesicles of the early secretory pathway. BRD4780 binds TMED9, releases MUC1-fs, and re-routes it for lysosomal degradation, an effect phenocopied by TMED9 deletion. Our findings reveal BRD4780 as a promising lead for the treatment of MKD and other toxic proteinopathies. Generally, we elucidate a novel mechanism for the entrapment of misfolded proteins by cargo receptors and a strategy for their release and anterograde trafficking to the lysosome."

The DNA replication machinery in all forms of life contains a helicase at the prow of the replication fork that couples ATP hydrolysis to the separation of parental DNA duplexes (Alberts, 2003Alberts B. DNA replication and recombination.Nature. 2003; 421: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). While bacterial and archaeal replicative helicases are homohexameric rings, their eukaryotic counterpart is more complex, consisting of a Mcm2-7 heterohexameric ATPase forming a two-tiered ring and an additional five accessory factors—Cdc45 and the GINS heterotetramer (Sld5, Psf1, Psf2, and Psf3)—that brace the N-terminal tier of the Mcm ring (Costa et al., 2011Costa A.

This tightly assembled 11-subunit complex is referred to as CMG (Cdc45, Mcm2-7, GINS) (Ilves et al., 2010Ilves I. Petojevic T. Pesavento J.J. Botchan M.R.

CMG formation occurs at origins of replication and is mediated by a multitude of factors (Bell and Labib, 2016Bell S.P. Labib K. Chromosome Duplication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2016; 203: 1027-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Helicase loading and activation are segregated into two phases of the cell cycle to ensure that no origin can be fired more than once per cell cycle (Siddiqui et al., 2013Siddiqui K. On K.F.

In G1 phase, the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 assemble two Mcm2-7 ring hexamers around origin double-stranded (ds)DNA through the Mcm2/5 interface (Bochman and Schwacha, 2008Bochman M.L.

These assembly steps are controlled by two cell-cycle-regulated kinases, CDK and DDK, and result in two CMGs that are oriented on dsDNA in a head-to-head manner (Douglas et al., 2018Douglas M.E.

USA. 2017; 114: E697-E706Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The final stage of origin activation requires melting of the origin dsDNA and opening of the two Mcm2-7 rings to encircle opposite single-stranded (ss)DNAs. This transition enables the two CMGs to move past one another, after which they nucleate assembly of replisome components and establish two diverging replication forks. The essential Mcm10 protein is required for CMGs to leave the origin (Baxley and Bielinsky, 2017Baxley R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Mcm10: A Dynamic Scaffold at Eukaryotic Replication Forks.Genes (Basel). 2017; 8: E73Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), possibly by enabling transition from dsDNA to ssDNA. However, the mechanism by which the topologically closed CMG switches from dsDNA to ssDNA binding and the exact role of Mcm10 in CMG activation remain enigmatic. Once underway, CMG resides at the ss-ds DNA forked junction, unwinding dsDNA by tracking along the leading ssDNA strand in the 3′-to-5′ direction while excluding the lagging strand from its central channel (Fu et al., 2011Fu Y.V.

Duplication of the leading and lagging strands is carried out by DNA polymerases Pol ε and Pol δ, respectively (Georgescu et al., 2015Georgescu R.E. Schauer G.D. Yao N.Y. Langston L.D. Yurieva O.

Cell. 2008; 30: 137-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). During normal synthesis, CMG associates with the polymerases, as well as various other factors, and acts as the central scaffold of the replisome progression complex (Gambus et al., 2006Gambus A. Jones R.C. Sanchez-Diaz A. Kanemaki M. van Deursen F. Edmondson R.D. Labib K. GINS maintains association of Cdc45 with MCM in replisome progression complexes at eukaryotic DNA replication forks.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Analogous to its assembly, disassembly of CMG is also a highly regulated process (Dewar and Walter, 2017Dewar J.M. Walter J.C. Mechanisms of DNA replication termination.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). When two opposing forks converge upon replication termination, CMG is ubiquitylated and subsequently unloaded from DNA (Deegan et al., 2019Deegan T.D. Baxter J. Ortiz Bazan M.Á. Yeeles J.T.P.

Cdc48 and a ubiquitin ligase drive disassembly of the CMG helicase at the end of DNA replication.Science. 2014; 346: 1253596Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Regular fork progression is often interrupted by DNA damage, recombination intermediates, and other obstacles existing in the chromosome (Berti and Vindigni, 2016Berti M. Vindigni A. Replication stress: getting back on track.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Upon encountering a lesion, Pol ε stalls and uncouples from CMG, and the helicase needs to vacate the replication fork so that repair factors can gain access. Moreover, damaged forks can collapse and undergo fork reversal, in which the two nascent daughter strands pair and push the forked nexus backward to form a fourth arm, a structure incompatible with CMG encircling ssDNA (Amunugama et al., 2018Amunugama R. Willcox S. Wu R.A. Abdullah U.B. El-Sagheer A.H. Brown T. McHugh P.J. Griffith J.D. Walter J.C.

Cortez D. RPA and RAD51: fork reversal, fork protection, and genome stability.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The fate of CMG during fork stalling and reversal has not been investigated. Moreover, if CMG dissociates from DNA during repair, it is presumed incapable of rebinding DNA, and therefore, replication restart must await a fork from another origin. However, it remains unclear if CMG can remain on DNA during repair of a fork or if restart always requires another replisome traveling from a neighboring origin. In this work, we used correlative single-molecule fluorescence and force microscopy to directly observe the behavior of individual CMGs on DNA substrates. We found that CMG possesses the ability to open its closed ring and load onto ssDNA. Following successful ssDNA loading, CMG undergoes unidirectional translocation. Mcm10 promotes this process by enhancing the affinity of CMG to DNA. Furthermore, CMG-Mcm10 can assemble onto a ss-ds DNA fork junction and mediate fork progression and DNA replication. Unexpectedly, we discovered that when uncoupled from an active replisome, CMG-Mcm10 can depart a DNA fork and switch to a rapidly diffusive mode on dsDNA. Upon encountering a new fork, the diffusing CMG can switch back to ssDNA and nucleate a replisome. Together, these results reveal the existence of a ssDNA gate in CMG, which may enable the ring helicase to vacate the fork under replication stress and quickly restart DNA synthesis following repair. The presence of a ssDNA gate in CMG, and the requirement of Mcm10 for robust ss-ds switching, are also uniquely qualified to explain how CMG may transition from encircling dsDNA to encircling ssDNA at an origin. We prepared Saccharomyces cerevisiae CMG labeled with a Cy3 fluorophore on Cdc45 (Figure S1). We then used a single-molecule instrument that combines confocal fluorescence microscopy, optical tweezers, and automated microfluidics (Hashemi Shabestari et al., 2017Hashemi Shabestari M. Meijering A.E.C. Roos W.H. Wuite G.J.L. Peterman E.J.G. Recent Advances in Biological Single-Molecule Applications of Optical Tweezers and Fluorescence Microscopy.Methods Enzymol. 2017; 582: 85-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) to follow the interaction of CMG with DNA in real time (Figure 1A; STAR Methods). We first examined CMG on a ssDNA substrate prepared from biotinylated phage λ genomic dsDNA (48.5 kilobase pairs [kbp] in length) and tethered between two optically trapped beads (Figures S2A and S2B). We found that, when supplemented with ATP and Mcm10, CMG can readily bind to ssDNA and exhibit unidirectional translocation (Figure 1B). The rate of CMG translocation was measured to be 10.4 ± 0.9 nt/s (mean ± SEM, n = 62) with 1 mM ATP at room temperature. CMG moves on ssDNA in a 3′-to-5′ direction, as confirmed by determining the tether orientation with an oligo probe (Figure S2C; Table S1). The velocity distribution shows a single peak, and no obvious pausing was observed (Figures S2D–S2F). In the absence of ATP, CMG is able to bind but remains stationary on ssDNA (Figures 1C and 1D). Such ATP-dependent directed movement most likely requires strand encirclement via interactions between DNA and the central pore of the Mcm2-7 ring, as supported by structural studies of CMG and replicative hexameric helicases of all cell types (O’Donnell and Li, 2018O’Donnell M.E.

Struct. Biol. 2014; 25: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, loaded CMG can withstand high salt (0.5 M NaCl) and high tether tension (>80 piconewton [pN]) (Figure S2G), further suggesting that it is topologically linked to ssDNA. These results provide direct evidence that CMG can bind and encircle ssDNA without a free end and translocate in a directional and processive manner, suggesting the existence of a “ssDNA gate” in CMG that allows strand passage.Figure 1CMG Undergoes Directional Translocation on ssDNAShow full caption(A) Schematic of the experimental setup.

(H) Representative kymograph demonstrating that LD650-Mcm10 (red) alone stably binds to ssDNA without CMG. Next, we assessed the role of Mcm10 in CMG interaction with ssDNA. We found that omission of Mcm10 dramatically decreased the loading efficiency of CMG on ssDNA by 65-fold (Figure 2A) and moderately reduced the speed of CMG movement by 2-fold (5.2 ± 1.6 nt/s, n = 15). These results suggest that Mcm10 plays a critical role in the ability of CMG to encircle and translocate on ssDNA, presumably by forming a complex with CMG. To test this idea, we labeled Mcm10 with an LD650 fluorophore and used dual-color imaging to simultaneously detect CMG and Mcm10 fluorescence signals. Indeed, we observed that CMG and Mcm10 co-localize and co-migrate on ssDNA (Figure 2B). We also performed a bulk helicase assay to corroborate the single-molecule data. Without Mcm10, CMG can unwind a 32P-oligonucleotide with a 5′ flap annealed to circular M13 ssDNA (Ilves et al., 2010Ilves I. Petojevic T. Pesavento J.J. Botchan M.R.

Due to the 3′-5′ unwinding polarity of CMG, the helicase must open and close to load and encircle the circular ssDNA in order to unwind this flap. We also examined the interaction of LD650-Mcm10 with ssDNA and found that Mcm10 alone can stably bind DNA but does not display directed motion (Figure S2H). Taken together, these single-molecule and bulk results demonstrate the existence of an intrinsic ssDNA gate in the CMG ring that enables strand passage. Moreover, Mcm10 greatly promotes CMG loading, likely by enhancing its affinity to DNA. Thus, unless noted otherwise, Mcm10 was included throughout this study, and we hereafter refer to the CMG-Mcm10 complex as CMGM. We next examined the behavior of CMGM on dsDNA. CMGM in solution displayed minimal affinity to a tethered phage λ dsDNA at low force; by contrast, CMGM binding was readily observed upon application of high tension (>65 pN) to the tether (Figure 3A). We posited that this is due to binding of CMGM to force-induced ssDNA regions. To confirm this interpretation, we used the eukaryotic ssDNA-binding protein RPA labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (A488) to mark ssDNA regions of the tether. Areas of RPA fluorescence emerged when high tension was applied to the tether (Figure 3B), indicating that stretches of dsDNA are melted into ssDNA as characterized previously (King et al., 2013King G.A. Gross P. Bockelmann U. Modesti M. Wuite G.J. Peterman E.J. Revealing the competition between peeled ssDNA, melting bubbles, and S-DNA during DNA overstretching using fluorescence microscopy.Proc.

USA. 2009; 106: 18231-18236Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Notably, lowering the tension back to 10 pN led to strand reannealing and ejection of RPA from DNA, which is demonstrated by disappearance of the RPA fluorescence signal (Figure 3B). The observation that RPA rapidly dissociates in favor of DNA rehybridization entails that RPA alone cannot keep two complementary ssDNA strands separated unless the chromosome is under high tension or at least one strand is occupied with other proteins or nucleic acids—a concept that may have important implications for transactions involving RPA-ssDNA during repair or recombination and/or in signaling the DNA damage response. We then used two-color fluorescence detection to directly analyze the co-localization of Cy3-CMGM and A488-RPA. We found that CMGM preferentially (82%, n = 71) binds near the edges of RPA-coated ssDNA regions (i.e., within ∼300 nm or ∼500 nt of ss-ds DNA junctions given the spatial resolution of our assay; Figure 3C). We further performed three-color experiments to concomitantly visualize A488-RPA, Cy3-CMG, and LD650-Mcm10 and showed that CMGM stably interacts with RPA-coated ssDNA (Figure 3D). The ss-ds DNA junctions formed by force stretching mimic replication forks. If the loaded CMGM encircles ssDNA at the forked junction and functions as a replicative helicase, it is expected to support replisome assembly and DNA synthesis. To test this, we complemented Cy3-CMGM with the numerous protein factors required for replisome-mediated DNA synthesis in vitro (STAR Methods) (Georgescu et al., 2015Georgescu R.E. Schauer G.D.

Mammals, unlike budding yeast, depend on the histone H3 variant, CENP-A, to epigenetically specify the location of the centromere—the locus essential for chromosome segregation. Prior human artificial chromosomes (HACs) required large arrays of centromeric α-satellite repeats harboring binding sites for the DNA sequence-specific binding protein, CENP-B. We report the development of a type of HAC that functions independently of these constraints. Formed by an initial CENP-A nucleosome seeding strategy, a construct lacking repetitive centromeric DNA formed several self-sufficient HACs that showed no uptake of genomic DNA. In contrast to traditional α-satellite HAC formation, the non-repetitive construct can form functional HACs without CENP-B or initial CENP-A nucleosome seeding, revealing distinct paths to centromere formation for different DNA sequence types. Our developments streamline the construction and characterization of HACs to facilitate mammalian synthetic genome efforts."

Here, we dissected the role of a nociceptin peptide circuit in reward seeking. We generated a prepronociceptin (Pnoc)-Cre mouse line that revealed a unique subpopulation of paranigral ventral tegmental area (pnVTA) neurons enriched in prepronociceptin. Fiber photometry recordings during progressive ratio operant behavior revealed pnVTAPnoc neurons become most active when mice stop seeking natural rewards. Selective pnVTAPnoc neuron ablation, inhibition, and conditional VTA nociceptin receptor (NOPR) deletion increased operant responding, revealing that the pnVTAPnoc nucleus and VTA NOPR signaling are necessary for regulating reward motivation. Additionally, optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of this pnVTAPnoc nucleus caused avoidance and decreased motivation for rewards. These findings provide insight into neuromodulatory circuits that regulate motivated behaviors through identification of a previously unknown neuropeptide-containing pnVTA nucleus that limits motivation for rewards."

There are no updated data in Spain with a representative sample about disability.Cross-sectional study with 25,465 non-institutionalized older people who participated in the European Health Survey in 2009 and 2014 and the National Health Survey in 2011/12 and 2017 in Spain. The prevalence rates of disability were evaluated using the Katz Scale and Lawton and Brody Scale. Logistic regression was used to determine if there was an association between basic and instrumental activities of daily living and sociodemographic characteristics.More individuals had disability for instrumental activities of daily living (31.9%) than disability for basic activities of daily living (11.1%). The most predominant disability for instrumental activities of daily living was performing severe housework (34%). The prevalence of disabilities decreased from 2009 to 2017. In general, disability was associated with female gender, advanced age, lower education, restricted daily activity, being bedridden and higher pain levels.There is a considerable prevalence of disabilities for basic and instrumental activities of daily living in older people in Spain. Although the disability prevalence has decreased slowly from 2009 to 2017, it continues to remain a health problem. Gender may influence the disabilities for basic and instrumental activities of daily living.

To understand how broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can be elicited, we identified, characterized, and tracked five neutralizing Ab lineages targeting the HIV-1-fusion peptide (FP) in vaccinated macaques over time. Genetic and structural analyses revealed two of these lineages to belong to a reproducible class capable of neutralizing up to 59% of 208 diverse viral strains. B cell analysis indicated each of the five lineages to have been initiated and expanded by FP-carrier priming, with envelope (Env)-trimer boosts inducing cross-reactive neutralization. These Abs had binding-energy hotspots focused on FP, whereas several FP-directed Abs induced by immunization with Env trimer-only were less FP-focused and less broadly neutralizing. Priming with a conserved subregion, such as FP, can thus induce Abs with binding-energy hotspots coincident with the target subregion and capable of broad neutralization."

https://openalex.org/W2964323059,"Group II introns are a class of retroelements that invade DNA through a copy-and-paste mechanism known as retrotransposition. Their coordinated activities occur within a complex that includes a maturase protein, which promotes splicing through an unknown mechanism. The mechanism of splice site exchange within the RNA active site during catalysis also remains unclear. We determined two cryo-EM structures at 3.6-Å resolution of a group II intron reverse splicing into DNA. These structures reveal that the branch-site domain VI helix swings 90°, enabling substrate exchange during DNA integration. The maturase assists catalysis through a transient RNA-protein contact with domain VI that positions the branch-site adenosine for lariat formation during forward splicing. These findings provide the first direct evidence of the role the maturase plays during group II intron catalysis. The domain VI dynamics closely parallel spliceosomal branch-site helix movement and provide strong evidence for a retroelement origin of the spliceosome."
https://openalex.org/W2964587182,"Hypoxia occurs in many human solid tumors and activates multiple cellular adaptive-response pathways, including the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a critical role in tumorigenesis, and β-catenin has been shown to enhance hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α)-activated gene expression, thereby supporting cell survival during hypoxia. However, the molecular interplay between hypoxic ER stress, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and HIF1α-mediated gene regulation during hypoxia remains incompletely understood. Here, we report that hypoxic ER stress reduces β-catenin stability, which, in turn, enhances the activity of spliced X-box–binding protein 1 (XBP1s), a transcription factor and signal transducer of the UPR, in HIF1α-mediated hypoxic responses. We observed that in the RKO colon cancer cell line, which possesses a Wnt-stimulated β-catenin signaling cascade, increased ER stress during hypoxia is accompanied by a reduction in low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), and this reduction in LRP6 decreased β-catenin accumulation and impaired Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Of note, β-catenin interacted with both XBP1s and HIF1α, suppressing XBP1s-mediated augmentation of HIF1α target gene expression. Furthermore, Wnt stimulation or β-catenin overexpression blunted XBP1s-mediated cell survival under hypoxia. Together, these results reveal an unanticipated role for the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in hindering hypoxic UPR-mediated responses that increase cell survival. Our findings suggest that the molecular cross-talks between hypoxic ER stress, LRP6/β-catenin signaling, and the HIF1α pathway may represent an unappreciated mechanism that enables some tumor subtypes to survive and grow in hypoxic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2965465841,"Introduction Ovarian tumors are the most common diagnostic challenge for gynecologists and ultrasound examination has become the main technique for assessment of ovarian pathology and for preoperative distinction between malignant and benign ovarian tumors. However, ultrasonography is highly examiner-dependent and there may be an important variability between two different specialists when examining the same case. The objective of this work is the evaluation of different well-known Machine Learning (ML) systems to perform the automatic categorization of ovarian tumors from ultrasound images. Methods We have used a real patient database whose input features have been extracted from 348 images, from the IOTA tumor images database, holding together with the class labels of the images. For each patient case and ultrasound image, its input features have been previously extracted using Fourier descriptors computed on the Region Of Interest (ROI). Then, four ML techniques are considered for performing the classification stage: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Discriminant (LD), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Results According to our obtained results, the KNN classifier provides inaccurate predictions (less than 60% of accuracy) independently of the size of the local approximation, whereas the classifiers based on LD, SVM and ELM are robust in this biomedical classification (more than 85% of accuracy). Conclusions ML methods can be efficiently used for developing the classification stage in computer-aided diagnosis systems of ovarian tumor from ultrasound images. These approaches are able to provide automatic classification with a high rate of accuracy. Future work should aim at enhancing the classifier design using ensemble techniques. Another ongoing work is to exploit different kind of features extracted from ultrasound images."

A prospective cohort study in 57 hemodialysis patients was conducted. The patients were assigned to the MCO dialyzer group or the high-flux dialyzer group, according to the HD machine they used. The reduction ratio (RR) and one-year changes in small and middle molecules and CFH were analyzed. Over a 12-month follow-up, MCO HD did not reduce the serum levels of middle molecules (lambda free light chain [FLC], from 135.7 ± 39.9 to 132.0 ± 39.1 mg/L; kappa FLC, from 168.2 ± 58.5 to 167.7 ± 65.8 mg/L; β2-microglobulin, from 25.6 ± 9.6 to 28.4 ± 4.8 mg/L) or albumin (from 3.96 ± 0.31 to 3.94 ± 0.37 g/dL). MCO HD provided excellent RR of lambda FLC (49.3 ± 10.3%), kappa FLC (69.6 ± 10.4%) and β2-microglobulin (80.9 ± 7.3%), compared to high-flux HD. CFH was also removed well during an MCO HD session (RR of CPH, 85.5 [78.7–97.3] %), but long-term change was not significant (from 57.8 [46.2–79.1] to 62.0 [54.6–116.7] mg/L). The MCO dialyzer can be used effectively and safely in conventional HD settings, but long-term effects on large middle molecules and CFH were not significant.

The O-glycosylation of at least 23 proteins with an uncharacterized predicted trisaccharide glycan, mediated by the OTase PglL, was previously identified in B. cenocepacia (21.Lithgow K.V. Scott N.E. Iwashkiw J.A. Thomson E.L. Foster L.J. Feldman M.F. Dennis J.J. A general protein O-glycosylation system within the Burkholderia cepacia complex is involved in motility and virulence.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 92 (24673753): 116-13710.1111/mmi.12540Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the genes and gene products for the B. cenocepacia glycosylation machinery and the chemical structure of the glycan moiety were not elucidated. In this study, we report the identification of the Burkholderia O-glycosylation (ogc) cluster, which includes genes in chromosome 1 of B. cenocepacia (BCAL3114 to BCAL3118) encoding the enzymes required for the stepwise assembly of the lipid-linked O-glycan in the cytoplasm and its flipping across the inner membrane. We also discovered these genes are present in all species of Burkholderia and confirm biochemically the presence of O-linked proteins in several species of Burkholderia, suggesting protein O-glycosylation is a conserved feature of this genus. To elucidate the biosynthesis of the O-linked glycan, we generated knockout mutants in the ogc genes characterizing their effect on glycosylation and assessing the function of the epimerase within this cluster. From these studies, we have confirmed the predicted role of the ogc genes and also established the structure of the trisaccharide glycan. We also show that O-glycosylation is required for bacterial fitness in vitro and survival in a larvae infection model. Finally, we demonstrate that individuals previously infected with B. cenocepacia, Burkholderia multivorans, B. pseudomallei, and B. mallei develop anti-O-glycan serum antibodies, suggesting Burkholderia glycoproteins display a common epitope perceived by the human immune system. Previous work identified PglL (BCAL0960) as the OTase catalyzing the addition of an uncharacterized trisaccharide O-glycan to least 23 B. cenocepacia proteins (21.Lithgow K.V. Scott N.E. Iwashkiw J.A. Thomson E.L. Foster L.J. Feldman M.F. Dennis J.J. A general protein O-glycosylation system within the Burkholderia cepacia complex is involved in motility and virulence.Mol.

In OTase-dependent glycosylation pathways, the lipid-linked glycan precursor is assembled on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, translocated across the membrane, and then transferred onto acceptor proteins at the periplasmic side (22.Hug I. Feldman M.F. Analogies and homologies in lipopolysaccharide and glycoprotein biosynthesis in bacteria.Glycobiology. 2011; 21 (20871101): 138-15110.1093/glycob/cwq148Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that at least four genes encoding a phosphoglycosyltransferase (initiating enzyme that mediates the synthesis of a lipid-linked sugar) (23.Lukose V. Walvoort M.T.C. Imperiali B. Bacterial phosphoglycosyl transferases: initiators of glycan biosynthesis at the membrane interface.Glycobiology. 2017; 27 (28810664): 820-83310.1093/glycob/cwx064Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24.Valvano M.A. Common themes in glycoconjugate assembly using the biogenesis of O-antigen lipopolysaccharide as a model system.Biochemistry. 2011; 76 (21999533): 729-73510.1134/S0006297911070029PubMed Google Scholar), two additional glycosyltransferases, and a flippase protein would be required for the synthesis and translocation of a B. cenocepacia lipid-linked trisaccharide glycan (22.Hug I. Feldman M.F.

Chromosome 1 of B. cenocepacia has a putative five-gene operon flanked by the O-antigen synthesis cluster and lipid A-core biosynthesis genes (Fig. 1A) (25.Ortega X. Hunt T.A. Loutet S. Vinion-Dubiel A.D. Datta A. Choudhury B. Goldberg J.B. Carlson R.

These genes were previously annotated, according to their predicted functions, as wecA (BCAL3118, phosphoglycosyltransferase), galE (BCAL3117, UDP-glucose epimerase), wbxA and wbxB (BCAL3116 and BCAL3115, glycosyltransferases, GT2 family forming β-glycosidic bonds and GT4 family forming α-glycosidic bonds, respectively), and wzx (BCAL3114, flippase) (25.Ortega X.

The last ogc gene, BCAL3118, which encodes a predicted UDP–N-acetylhexosamine-1-P transferase homologous to WecA-like initiating enzymes for O-antigen synthesis, was renamed ogcI (for initiating transferase). The immediately upstream gene, BCAL3117, encodes a protein similar to UDP-glucose-4-epimerases of the NAD-dependent epimerase/dehydratase family, and it was renamed ogcE. The two predicted glycosyltransferase-encoding genes, BCAL3115 and BCAL3116, were renamed ogcA and ogcB, respectively. BCAL3114, renamed ogcX, encodes a predicted flippase protein belonging to the Wzx-like polysaccharide transporter family. Therefore, the ogc cluster encodes proteins whose predicted functions fit well with the required enzymatic activities to assemble the lipid-linked trisaccharide glycan for protein glycosylation, according to the model depicted in Fig. 1B. Using the SyntTax web server (26.Oberto J. SyntTax: a web server linking synteny to prokaryotic taxonomy.BMC Bioinformatics. 2013; 14 (23323735): 410.1186/1471-2105-14-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the Burkholderia genome database (27.Winsor G.L. Khaira B. Van Rossum T. Lo R. Whiteside M.D. Brinkman F.S. The Burkholderia genome database: facilitating flexible queries and comparative analyses.Bioinformatics. 2008; 24 (18842600): 2803-280410.1093/bioinformatics/btn524Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we discovered the ogc cluster is conserved in the majority of Burkholderia and Paraburkholderia species whose genomes have been sequenced (Fig. 1C). Most species retain the five-gene cluster with the genes arranged as in B. cenocepacia. In a reduced number of species, ogcXABE remain together, whereas ogcI appears as a single monocistronic gene separated from the cluster by a variable number of genes depending on the species examined (Fig. 1C). In Paraburkholderia rhizoxinica, ogcB is present as a monocistronic gene, whereas the rest of the genes, ogcXAEI, form a putative operon (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the ogc cluster appears to be a highly-conserved loci encoding the minimal set of gene products to produce the trisaccharide O-linked glycan observed in B. cenocepacia. To validate the ogc cluster’s role in protein glycosylation, we constructed an unmarked deletion mutant (Δogc) in the B. cenocepacia strain K56-2 and a ΔpglL mutant as a control. We also generated the individual unmarked, nonpolar deletion mutants ΔogcX, ΔogcI, ΔogcAB, and ΔogcE. In parallel, we constructed recombinant plasmids expressing His-tagged fusion forms of BCAL2640 and the DsbA1 protein from Neisseria meningitidis. BCAL2640 is a native glycosylated protein in B. cenocepacia, whereas the heterologously expressed DsbA1 is glycosylated by PglL (21.Lithgow K.V. Scott N.E. Iwashkiw J.A. Thomson E.L. Foster L.J. Feldman M.F. Dennis J.J. A general protein O-glycosylation system within the Burkholderia cepacia complex is involved in motility and virulence.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 92 (24673753): 116-13710.1111/mmi.12540Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and also by several different OTases (28.Gebhart C. Ielmini M.V. Reiz B. Price N.L. Aas F.E. Koomey M. Feldman M.F. Characterization of exogenous bacterial oligosaccharyltransferases in Escherichia coli reveals the potential for O-linked protein glycosylation in Vibrio cholerae and Burkholderia thailandensis.Glycobiology. 2012; 22 (22391990): 962-97410.1093/glycob/cws059Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Expression of BCAL2640 and DsbA1 was examined in the K56-2 parental strain and its isogenic Δogc and ΔpglL mutants. The purified BCAL2640 polypeptide obtained from Δogc and ΔpglL had increased relative mobility compared with that obtained from the parental strain, suggesting loss of glycosylation (Fig. 1D, left panel). Similarly, examination of DsbA1 mobility by immunoblot with anti-His tag antibodies also revealed DsbA1 polypeptides of lower apparent mass in samples purified from Δogc and ΔpglL, as well as from ΔogcX, ΔogcI, ΔogcAB, and ΔogcE mutants (Fig. 1D, right panel). Conversely, no difference in protein mobility was observed in DsbA1 expressed in an O-antigen synthesis deletion mutant ΔBCAL3119–BCAL3131, ruling out any contribution of the O-antigen genes to protein glycosylation (Fig. 1D, right panel). To directly monitor the glycosylation status of purified BCAL2640 expressed in strains K56-2, Δogc, and ΔpglL, the purified protein was digested with trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS. The trypsin-derived BCAL2640 peptide 152YAPPPAAVPVAATSGAQGGAAAAAAPAGTKPANAPR187, previously shown to be glycosylated (at the underlined serine residue) (21.Lithgow K.V. Scott N.E. Iwashkiw J.A. Thomson E.L. Foster L.J. Feldman M.F. Dennis J.J. A general protein O-glycosylation system within the Burkholderia cepacia complex is involved in motility and virulence.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 92 (24673753): 116-13710.1111/mmi.12540Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), was readily observable. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation (CID) confirms the peptide is modified with at least two glycans corresponding to HexNAc–HexNAc-262 (Fig. 2A) and HexNAc–HexNAc–Hex (Fig. 2B), whereas higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation confirmed the peptide sequence (Fig. 2C). The glycosylated form of this peptide was 15-fold more abundant than the unglycosylated form, indicating the majority of BCAL2640 was glycosylated (Fig. 2D). In contrast, this glycopeptide was absent in the purified protein obtained from ΔpglL or Δogc mutants (Fig. 2, E and F). Therefore, deletion of the ogc cluster causes the same defect in protein glycosylation as the loss of the OTase PglL, demonstrating it contains the genes encoding functions for the synthesis and assembly of the protein glycan. To determine the structure of the B. cenocepacia O-glycan, glycopeptides modified with the trisaccharide were generated from glycosylated DsbA1 by digestion with proteinase K and enriched by size-exclusion chromatography. This glycopeptide fraction was identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analysis by both homo- and heteronuclear two-dimensional NMR experiments (Fig. 3A and Table S1). The heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum (Fig. 3B) showed three main anomeric signals with 1H/13C values at 5.07/94.5, 4.63/101.7, and 4.45/106.3 ppm (Fig. 3A), each labeled with a capital letter. For the A spin system, total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) displayed three correlations that connected H-1 up to H-4 (Fig. 3C and Table S1). The attribution of these densities to the right proton in the sequence was inferred by analyzing the homonuclear correlation (COSY) spectrum, whereas the position of H-5 was identified by the H-4/H-5 correlation in the transverse rotating-frame Overhauser enhancement (T-ROESY) spectrum, which in turn defined the position of the two H-6 protons at 3.76 ppm. These results, together with those derived from the HSQC spectrum (Fig. 3B) and the H-2/C-2 values (4.38/51.0 ppm) along with the presence of an acetyl group in the proton spectrum, indicated that A was GalNAc. The 3JH1, H2 value (3.3 Hz) pointed to an α-configuration for the anomeric center. In addition, the downfield displacement of C-3 (79.1 ppm) with respect to the standard value (72.3 ppm) (29.Bock K. Pedersen C. Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of monosaccharides.Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41 (10.1016/S0065-2318(08)60055-4): 27-66Crossref Scopus (1457) Google Scholar) indicated a substitution at this position. For B and C residues, their 3JH1, H2 values (8.4 and 8.0 Hz, respectively) disclosed their β-configuration at the anomeric center. Using the same approach as described for residue A, residue B was identified as GalNAc (H-2/C-2 values at 4.11/52.0 ppm) and residue C as galactose (H2/C-2 values at 3.51/71.6 ppm). The comparison of the carbon chemical shifts of these two residues with those taken as in Ref. 29.Bock K. Pedersen C. Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of monosaccharides.Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41 (10.1016/S0065-2318(08)60055-4): 27-66Crossref Scopus (1457) Google Scholar showed that C-3 of B (75.8 ppm) and C-6 of C (64.4 ppm) were shifted downfield with respect to the standard values (72.3 and 62.0 ppm, respectively), suggesting the presence of a substitution at these positions. The sequence of the three units was inferred by NOE contacts found in the T-ROESY spectrum among H-1 of A and both H-3 and H-4 of B, and H-1 of C with H-3 of A (Fig. 3C). Therefore, combining data from the nuclear Overhauser effects with the 13C chemical shift displacement observed allowed us to build the sequence C-(1→3)–A-(1→3)–B. Importantly, H-1 of B did not correlate with any sugar-related signal but only with protons related to the peptide moiety, for which we conclude the glycan structure is β-Gal-(1→3)–α-GalNAc-(1→3)–β-GalNAc-(1→) directly linked to the protein (Fig. 3B). The T-ROESY spectrum did not contain cross-peaks connecting to any of the two H-6s of C to the substituent at O-6, but the type of chemical displacement of C-6 and C-5, along with the 1H chemical shift of both H-6s, suggested the presence of an acyl substituent that was consistent with a succinylated hexose residue, observed as a mass of 262 Da by MS analysis, but it remains to be structurally identified by NMR. The predicted OgcE epimerase (Fig. 1A) could be required for the synthesis of UDP-GalNAc, UDP-Gal, or both, which are the expected precursors for the assembly of the trisaccharide glycan. However, the O-antigen in B. cenocepacia K56-2 is composed of a GalNAc–GalNAc–Rha repeating unit (25.Ortega X. Hunt T.A. Loutet S. Vinion-Dubiel A.D. Datta A. Choudhury B. Goldberg J.B. Carlson R.

To determine whether gcE is also required for O-antigen synthesis, we examined the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) profile of K56-2, ΔpglL, Δogc, and various deletion mutants in ogc genes. Only the Δogc and ΔogcE mutants produced truncated O-antigen, as indicated by a strong band migrating above the band corresponding to lipid A-core and the loss of bands corresponding to polymeric O-antigen (Fig. 4A). The O-antigen in B. cenocepacia K56-2 is synthesized via the ABC export pathway (25.Ortega X. Hunt T.A. Loutet S. Vinion-Dubiel A.D. Datta A. Choudhury B. Goldberg J.B. Carlson R.

https://openalex.org/W2966261526,"Background More than 230,000 veterans—about 1/3 of US personnel deployed in the 1990–1991 Persian Gulf War—developed chronic, multi-symptom health problems now called “Gulf War illness” (GWI), for which mechanisms and objective diagnostic signatures continue to be sought. Methods Targeted, broad-spectrum serum metabolomics was used to gain insights into the biology of GWI. 40 male participants, included 20 veterans who met both Kansas and CDC diagnostic criteria for GWI and 20 nonveteran controls without similar symptoms that were 1:1 matched to GWI cases by age, sex, and ethnicity. Serum samples were collected and archived at -80° C prior to testing. 358 metabolites from 46 biochemical pathways were measured by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Results Veterans with GWI, compared to healthy controls, had abnormalities in 8 of 46 biochemical pathways interrogated. Lipid abnormalities accounted for 78% of the metabolic impact. Fifteen ceramides and sphingomyelins, and four phosphatidylcholine lipids were increased. Five of the 8 pathways were shared with the previously reported metabolic phenotype of males with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). However, 4 of the 5 shared pathways were regulated in opposite directions; key pathways that were up-regulated in GWI were down-regulated in ME/CFS. The single pathway regulated in the same direction was purines, which were decreased. Conclusions Our data show that despite heterogeneous exposure histories, a metabolic phenotype of GWI was clearly distinguished from controls. Metabolomic differences between GWI and ME/CFS show that common clinical symptoms like fatigue can have different chemical mechanisms and different diagnostic implications. Larger studies will be needed to validate these findings."

https://openalex.org/W2965582409,"Caesarean section (CS) can prevent maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. However, it involves risks and high costs that can be a burden, especially in low and middle income countries. The aim of this study is to assess its magnitude and correlates among women of reproductive age in the urban and rural areas of Vietnam. We analyzed microdata from the national Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) conducted in 2014 by using a representative sample of households at the national level in both urban and rural areas. A total of 1,350 women who delivered in institutional settings in the two years preceding the survey were included. Frequency and percentage distributions of the variables were performed. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were undertaken to identify the factors associated with CS. Odds ratios with a 95% confidence interval were used to ascertain the direction and strength of the associations. The overall CS rate among the women who delivered in healthcare facilities in Vietnam has rapidly increased and reached a high level (29.2%). After controlling for significant characteristics, living in urban areas doubles the likelihood of undergoing a CS (OR = 1.98; 95% CI 1.48 to 2.67). Maternal age at delivery over 35 years is a major positive correlate of CS. Beyond this common phenomenon, different distinct lines of socioeconomic and demographic cleavage operate in urban compared with rural areas. The differences regarding the correlates of CS according to the place of residence suggest that specific measures should be taken in each setting to allow women to access childbirth services that are appropriate to their needs."
https://openalex.org/W2965921109,"Objectives To provide baseline information on inappropriate prescribing (IP), and to evaluate whether potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), as defined by STOPP (Screening Tool of Older Persons' potentially inappropriate Prescriptions) criteria, were associated with preventable adverse drug events (ADEs) and/or hospitalization. Methods We prospectively studied older patients (n = 301) admitted to three urban, public-funded hospitals. We scrutinized their medical records and used STOPP-START (Screening Tool to Alert Prescribers to Right Treatment) criteria to determine PIM and potential prescribing omissions (PPO) respectively- together these constitute IP. Prescriptions with PIM(s) were subjected to a pharmacist medication review, aimed at detecting cases of ADE(s). The vetted cases were further assessed by an expert consensus panel to ascertain: i) causality between the ADE and hospitalization, using, the World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Centre criteria, and, ii) whether the ADEs were avoidable (using Hallas criteria). Finally, percentages of PIM-associated ADEs that were both preventable and linked to hospitalization were calculated. Results IP prevalence was 58.5% (n = 176). A majority (49.5%, n = 150) had moderate to severe degree of comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index score ≥ 3). Median age was 72 years. Median number of medications was 6 and 30.9% (n = 93) had ≥8 medications. PIM prevalence was 34.9% (117 PIMs, n = 105) and PPO 37.9% (191 PPOs, n = 114). Most PIMs and PPOs involved overuse of aspirin and underuse of both antiplatelets and statins respectively. With every increase in the number of medications prescribed, the likelihood of PIM occurrence increased by 20%, i.e.1.2 fold (OR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.1–1.3). Among the 105 patients with PIMs, 33 ADEs (n = 33); 31 ADEs (n = 31) considered “causal” or “contributory” to hospitalization; 27 ADEs (n = 27) deemed “avoidable” or “potentially avoidable”; and 25 PIM-associated ADEs, preventable, and that induced hospitalization (n = 25), were identified: these equated to prevalence of 31.4%, 29.5%, 25.7%, and 23.8% respectively. The most common ADEs were masked hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleed. With every additional PIM prescribed, the odds for ADE occurrence increased by 12 folds (OR 11.8, 95% CI 5.20–25.3). Conclusion The majority of the older patients who were admitted to secondary care for acute illnesses were potentially exposed to IP. Approximately a quarter of the patients were prescribed with PIMs, which were plausibly linked with preventable ADEs that directly caused or contributed to hospitalization."
https://openalex.org/W2965221937,"Replication protein A (RPA) is the major eukaryotic ssDNA-binding protein and has essential roles in genome maintenance. RPA binds to ssDNA through multiple modes, and recent studies have suggested that the RPA–ssDNA interaction is dynamic. However, how RPA alternates between different binding modes and modifies ssDNA structures in this dynamic interaction remains unknown. Here, we used single-molecule FRET to systematically investigate the interaction between human RPA and ssDNA. We show that RPA can adopt different types of binding complexes with ssDNAs of different lengths, leading to the straightening or bending of the ssDNAs, depending on both the length and structure of the ssDNA substrate and the RPA concentration. Importantly, we noted that some of the complexes are highly dynamic, whereas others appear relatively static. On the basis of the above observations, we propose a model explaining how RPA dynamically engages with ssDNA. Of note, fluorescence anisotropy indicated that RPA can also associate with RNA but with a lower binding affinity than with ssDNA. At the single-molecule level, we observed that RPA is undergoing rapid and repetitive associations with and dissociation from the RNA.

As a stable heterotrimer, RPA is composed of a 70-kDa subunit (RPA1), a 32-kDa subunit (RPA2), and a 14-kDa subunit (RPA3), and a trimerization core is formed through the interaction between each subunit (Fig. 1A) (9Fanning E.

In addition, RPA has six structurally related oligonucleotide-binding (OB) folds that interact with DNA and a winged helix domain that primarily interacts with protein partners.

It is generally agreed that RPA binds tightly to ssDNA with a defined 5′–3′ polarity (12Iftode C.

A study using small-angle X-ray scattering showed that RPA engages ssDNA in two different modes either with the tandem high-affinity 70A-B domains if only 10 nt of ssDNA is available or with both 70A-B and the trimerization core on the 20-nt or longer ssDNA because of the C and D domains of RPA (2Brosey C.A.

Moreover, the stability of the interaction between RPA and ssDNA depends on the length of ssDNA available. Similarly, several other studies revealed that RPA associates with ssDNA in a low-affinity mode in which 70A-B of RPA1 binds ∼10-nt ssDNA and a high-affinity mode in which 70A-B and the trimerization core cover ∼30 nt of ssDNA (14Bochkareva E.

An overview of the molecular mechanisms of recombinational DNA repair.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect.

During HR, DSB formation is followed by end-processing reactions in which long 3′ ends of ssDNA are produced. These ends are quickly bound by RPA in eukaryotes to protect the ssDNA from degradation and to remove any secondary structures. Therefore, RPA must be capable of binding very tightly to ssDNA. However, RPA must also be displaced from ssDNA so that the ssDNA can be accessed by other downstream proteins. Recently, several studies have proposed dynamic models for the RPA function in DNA-processing pathways (2Brosey C.A. Yan C. Tsutakawa S.E. Heller W.T. Rambo R.P. Tainer J.A. Ivanov I. Chazin W.J.

However, more work is still required to fully understand the rich dynamics of RPA in complex with DNA; in particular, the mechanisms by which RPA navigates between its different DNA-binding states and remodels the structure of ssDNA in the dynamic process remain unknown. RPA functions as a key sensor of ssDNA at stalled replication forks and DNA damage sites. Therefore, in addition to the 3′ partial duplex in the HR process as described above, RPA binding to ssDNA may also occur at a variety of structures such as the 5′ partial duplex and the DNA fork, which mimics the stalled replication fork structure. How the identity of the DNA substrates influences the binding of RPA also needs to be determined. Recently, RPA has been found downstream of the promoter in transcribed regions of genes (33Sikorski T.W. Ficarro S.B. Holik J. Kim T. Rando O.J. Marto J.A. Buratowski S. Sub1 and RPA associate with RNA polymerase II at different stages of transcription.Mol.

Genome-wide ChIP analysis shows that RPA localization strongly correlates with RNA polymerase II throughout the genome. In addition, RPA has also been reported to be involved in the suppression of R-loops (34Ohle C. Tesorero R. Schermann G. Dobrev N. Sinning I. Fischer T. Transient RNA-DNA hybrids are required for efficient double-strand break repair.Cell. 2016; 167 (27881299): 1001-1013.e710.1016/j.cell.2016.10.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 35Nguyen H.D.

This study revealed that RPA is a sensor of R-loops, extending the versatile role of RPA in suppression of genomic instability. The aforementioned tantalizing links among transcription, R-loops, and RPA raise the interesting question of whether RPA can associate with single-stranded RNA similarly to its interaction with ssDNA. In this study, we investigated the dynamic binding of human RPA on ssDNA or RNA by single-molecule FRET (smFRET), fluorescence anisotropy, and gel filtration. First, we demonstrated that RPA can adopt different types of binding complexes with different lengths of ssDNA, leading to the straightening or bending of ssDNA. Importantly, some of these complexes are highly dynamic, and others appear relatively static. Second, we discovered that the properties of the complexes vary with the identity of the substrate (i.e. 3′ versus 5′ overhang, DNA fork, etc.), suggesting that RPA may bind differently to ssDNA in different DNA-processing pathways. Third, using the fluorescence anisotropy assay, we found that RPA can associate with RNA and that the binding affinity is lower with RNA than with ssDNA. At the single-molecule level, we observed that RPA is undergoing rapid and repetitive association and dissociation on RNA. This study is expected to help us to understand how RPA navigates between different binding modes and remodels the structure of ssDNA in different DNA-processing pathways, including those of replication and homologous recombination. In addition, the newly identified RNA-binding activity may provide important clues in understanding how RPA senses R-loops and associates with RNA polymerase in cells. Human RPA is composed of a 70-kDa subunit, a 32-kDa subunit, and a 14-kDa subunit (Fig. 1A). The result of the gel filtration analysis presented in Fig. S1A confirms that, in free solution, RPA exists in a single form in which the three subunits are tightly associated. The DNA-binding properties of RPA were also characterized by fluorescence anisotropy measurements under equilibrium conditions. The apparent dissociation constant, KD, was obtained by fitting the binding curve with the Hill equation (Fig. S1B). Fig. S1C shows that the KD value increases only slightly from 0 to 100 mm KCl; however, in 200 mm KCl, the binding affinity is reduced, possibly due to increased electrostatic screening. Therefore, 100 mm KCl was adopted in all of the experiments. In addition, the KD value for the 200 mm KCl experiment was 4.83 ± 0.2 nm, consistent with that previously reported, 5.8 ± 0.4 nm, in similar buffer (2Brosey C.A. Yan C. Tsutakawa S.E. Heller W.T. Rambo R.P. Tainer J.A. Ivanov I. Chazin W.J. A new structural framework for integrating replication protein A into DNA processing machinery.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 (23303776): 2313-232710.1093/nar/gks1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After examining the purity and binding properties of RPA, we next characterized the dynamic binding process between RPA and ssDNA at the single-molecule level using smFRET. The substrate contained ssDNA at the 3′ end of a 29-bp duplex that mimics the DNA structure after the end resection process in the early stage of DNA recombination, and it was anchored on a coverslip by a biotin–streptavidin link (Fig. 1B). The 3′ end of the ssDNA and the 5′ end of the stem strand were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively. As RPA may bind to ssDNA by different modes in a length-dependent manner (2Brosey C.A. Yan C.

We first tested a short 10-nt ssDNA, dT10. In 2 nm RPA (Fig. 1C, panel 1), the population at E0.95 (EFRET represents the state with the subscript FRET value), which corresponds to the free-ssDNA state, decreased slightly, whereas the populations at lower EFRET values, which reflect the RPA-bound state, simultaneously increased. The individual FRET trajectories showed that, in 2 nm RPA, the FRET value fluctuated frequently between ∼E0.95 and ∼E0.6 in abrupt steps (Fig. 1D, panel 1), reflecting the rapid association and dissociation of RPA on dT10. The above results also indicate that RPA binding can induce the straightening of dT10, as the RPA-bound ssDNA has a lower EFRET value than the free ssDNA. With increases in RPA concentrations, the FRET distribution shifted significantly from E0.95 to E0.6 (Fig. 1C), suggesting the likelihood that the dT10 association with RPA increased. Furthermore, the stable FRET level at ∼E0.6 indicated that almost all DNA molecules were extended in 100–200 nm RPA (Fig. 1D, panels 3 and 4). Fig. S2, A and B, display the fluorescence signals of dT10 in the presence of 20 nm RPA for a substrate labeled with both Cy3 and Cy5 or in control reactions using dT10 substrates labeled with only Cy5 or only Cy3. These controls verify that the RPA-dependent changes in fluorescence emission we observed were due to distance-dependent differences and not due to changes in fluorophore emission properties such as protein-induced enhancing or quenching. After the free RPA is flushed from the fluidic chamber with buffer (Fig. S2C), the FRET level of the dT10 returned to the original value of free DNA (E0.95), suggesting the dissociation of RPA from the 10-nt ssDNA. The gel filtration results suggest that RPA forms one type of complex with dT10 in a broad range of protein concentrations (Fig. S3A), most likely due to the reported 10-nt mode in which only the 70A-B domains in RPA1 make contact with the ssDNA (2Brosey C.A.

Occasionally, a subtle intermediate state could be observed by smFRET (Fig. S2D), and it may represent the sequential engagement of the two domains. Taken together, these findings indicate that the binding of RPA to dT10 is highly dynamic with very rapid association and dissociation from the ssDNA, consistent with the low ssDNA affinity in the 10-nt mode (2Brosey C.A. Yan C. Tsutakawa S.E. Heller W.T. Rambo R.P. Tainer J.A. Ivanov I. Chazin W.J.

As RPA binds to ssDNA with different modes depending on the length of the ssDNA that it contacts (2Brosey C.A. Yan C. Tsutakawa S.E. Heller W.T. Rambo R.P. Tainer J.A. Ivanov I. Chazin W.J.

In 2 nm RPA, the FRET histogram of dT20 shows a shift from ∼E0.6 to a lower band at ∼E0.25, indicating the straightening of the ssDNA (Fig. 2A, panel 1). In addition, from the individual trace (Fig. 2B, panel 1), two different FRET states, one at ∼E0.45 and one at ∼E0.25, can be observed. The distributions of dwell time at E0.45 and E0.25 followed a single-exponential decay with time constants of 2.1 and 18.1 s, respectively (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the E0.25 state is much more stable than the E0.45 state. More importantly, dT20 dynamically switched between those two states, instead of remaining static, in the presence of 2 nm RPA. With the increase in RPA concentration, the FRET histogram of dT20 shifts significantly from ∼E0.6 to ∼E0.25, indicating that almost all the DNA molecules are straightened (Fig. 2, A and B, panels 2–4). The gel filtration results suggest that RPA may form two different types of complexes with dT20 with different molecular weights, depending on the protein concentration (Fig. S3B). Therefore, it is likely that, at high protein concentrations, two RPAs may bind side-by-side to the dT20. We also determined the fractions of the FRET traces that show dynamic properties after association with RPA within the 2-min recording time due to RPA dissociation or navigation between different binding modes (Fig. 2D). In 2 nm RPA, almost each trace is highly dynamic; however, with increases in protein concentration, the majority of these traces become static, possibly indicating the stable association of dT20 by two RPAs. Taken together, the above results suggest that the 20-nt ssDNA may adopt different types of binding complexes with RPA; additionally, some of the complexes are highly dynamic, whereas some are static. To further characterize the binding of RPA to the longer ssDNA, we designed a DNA substrate, dT30, with a 30-nt ssDNA strand. When 2 nm RPA was used, we detected both a decrease in FRET values from E0.4 to E0.2 and an increase in FRET values from E0.4 to E0.85 (Fig. 3, A and B, panel 1), reflecting straightening as well as bending of the ssDNA. As the FRET increase was not observed for dT10 or dT20 at the same protein concentrations, this increase may reflect the appearance of the 30-nt-binding mode of RPA in which RPA is fully engaged to 24–30 nt of the ssDNA, and the complex is curved (2Brosey C.A.

The c-di-GMP–mediated signaling pathways and mechanisms that control flagellar output remain to be fully unveiled. Studying surface-tethered and free-swimming P. aeruginosa PAO1 cells, we found that the overexpression of an exogenous diguanylate cyclase (DGC) raises the global cellular c-di-GMP concentration and thereby inhibits flagellar motor switching and decreases motor speed, reducing swimming speed and reversal frequency, respectively.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a potentially lethal pathogenic bacterium for immune-compromised patients, relies on a single polar flagellum to swim in liquid and swarm across solid surfaces. Flagellum-dependent motility is essential for P. aeruginosa in establishing acute and chronic bacterial infections and evading host immune systems. Flagellum-dependent swimming motility enables the rapid dissemination of P. aeruginosa from the initial infection site of burn patients to cause potentially life-threatening systemic infections (1Lyczak J.B.

The swimming motility also enables P. aeruginosa cells to navigate through mucus and interact with epithelial membranes to establish respiratory tract infection (2Feldman M. Bryan R. Rajan S.

P. aeruginosa strains isolated from the airway of cystic fibrosis patients often lack the flagellum (8Luzar M.A. Thomassen M.J. Montie T.C.

Lovewell R.R. O'Toole G.A. Hogan D.A. Berwin B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa evasion of phagocytosis is mediated by loss of swimming motility and is independent of flagellum expression.Infect.

Hence, flagellum-dependent motility is considered a key pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognized by phagocytes to initiate engulfment. Given the importance of flagellum-dependent motility in bacterial pathogenesis and host–pathogen interaction, P. aeruginosa has evolved sophisticated regulatory systems to control flagellar output.

Existing data suggest that P. aeruginosa has evolved multiple c-di-GMP–dependent signaling pathways to regulate flagellum biosynthesis and motor output. Several c-di-GMP–metabolizing diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs) have been shown to impact flagellum-dependent motility in P. aeruginosa (11Ha D.G. Richman M.E. O'Toole G.A.

Although it was inferred that high cellular c-di-GMP levels would inhibit flagellar motor switching, the effect of elevated cellular c-di-GMP levels on motor switching has not been demonstrated. In this report, we present data to support the view that elevated cellular c-di-GMP concentrations inhibit flagellar motor switching and swimming reversal in a MapZ-dependent manner. We further reveal that 3 of 22 putative c-di-GMP PDEs of P. aeruginosa PAO1 act upstream of MapZ to exert control on flagellar motor switching. The results advance our understanding of how c-di-GMP regulates flagellum-dependent motility and disclose the unexpected roles of the three PDEs, DipA, NbdA, and RbdA, in controlling flagellar motor switching and bacterial motility. To determine how elevated cellular c-di-GMP concentrations impact flagellar motor activity, we transformed P. aeruginosa PAO1 cells with an overexpression plasmid that harbors the gene encoding the highly active Escherichia coli DGC protein YedQ.

Remarkably, most mapZR13A/pYedQ cells exhibited similar bidirectional flagellar motor as the PAO1 cells (Fig. 1B). When the average motor speed of the motile cells was measured, we found that the PAO1/pYedQ cells also exhibited a 3.1-fold lower motor speed than the PAO1 cells (Fig. 1C). The differences in motor output between the PAO1 and PAO1/pYedQ strains suggest that an elevated global c-di-GMP concentration can suppress both motor speed and motor switching. In contrast, the mapZR13A/pYedQ cells exhibited suppressed motor rotational speed, but normal motor switching behavior like the PAO1 cells (Fig. 1C). These observations strongly suggest that the suppression of motor speed is independent of MapZ. By using the well-established HPLC method (29Petrova O.E. Sauer K. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based detection and quantitation of cellular c-di-GMP.Methods Mol. Biol. 2017; 1657 (28889284): 33-4310.1007/978-1-4939-7240-1_4Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Roy A.B. Petrova O.E. Sauer K. Extraction and quantification of cyclic di-GMP from P. aeruginosa.Bio. Protoc. 2013; 3 (25429368): e828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we confirmed that the cellular c-di-GMP concentration of the PAO1/pYedQ strain is much higher than that of PAO1 (16-fold increase) (Fig. 1D). We noticed that the global cellular c-di-GMP level of the mapZR13A/pYedQ strain seemed to be slightly lower than that of the PAO1/pYedQ strain, whereas introducing the R13A mutation into the mapZ gene in PAO1 did not cause a significant decrease in the c-di-GMP level (Fig. 1D). Taken together, the results confirm that MapZ is indispensable for c-di-GMP to exert its effect on motor switching and further suggest that MapZ does not seem to be required for motor speed control. Because the suppression on motor speed does not require MapZ, the dampening effect of c-di-GMP on motor speed is most likely exerted through another c-di-GMP–binding effector in the YedQ-expressing cells. The single-flagellated P. aeruginosa cells swim following a “run–reverse–turn” pattern, which is distinct from the “run–tumble–run” pattern observed for E. coli cells (31Wadhams G.H. Armitage J.P. Making sense of it all: bacterial chemotaxis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5 (15573139): 1024-103710.1038/nrm1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa cells move forward (“run”) when the motor undergoes CCW rotation and backward (“reversal”) when the flagellum undergoes CW rotation (28Qian C. Wong C.C. Swarup S. Chiam K.H. Bacterial tethering analysis reveals a “run-reverse-turn” mechanism for Pseudomonas species motility.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2013; 79 (23728820): 4734-474310.1128/AEM.01027-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Considering the effect of high cellular c-di-GMP concentration on motor switching and rotational speed, it is logical to expect that the rise of cellular c-di-GMP concentration would influence flagellum-dependent swimming motility. By examining the trajectory of swimming bacterial cells using an inverted microscope, we observed that the PAO1 cells exhibit the typical run–reverse–turn trajectories that features sharp turn or reversal to change direction (Fig. 2A). On the contrary, most PAO1/pYedQ cells exhibited no turn or reversal and only ran in a single direction. This swimming pattern is consistent with the unidirectional motor rotation of the cells observed in the cell-tethering assays. Meanwhile, the mapZR13A/pYedQ cells are similar to the PAO1 cells by exhibiting frequent reversal of swimming direction, which is consistent with the frequent motor switching observed for the mapZR13A/pYedQ cells (Fig. 2A). From the swimming trajectories, we extracted the average swimming speed and persistence of runs, which is inversely proportional to the frequency of directional reversal. PAO1 cells exhibited 2.4-fold higher swimming speed than the other two mutant strains (Fig. 2B), in accordance with the different motor speed observed for the three strains (Fig. 1C). The PAO1/pYedQ cells have a greater average persistence of runs than the PAO1 and mapZR13A/pYedQ cells (Fig. 2C), further supporting the role played by MapZ in inhibiting swimming reversal. The swimming behaviors of the three strains agree well with the motor speed and motor switching pattern observed in the cell-tethering assays. The results further support that elevated cellular c-di-GMP concentrations inhibit motor switching to decrease the frequency of swimming reversal via the MapZ-mediated mechanism. Having demonstrated that expression of an exogenous DGC can raise the global c-di-GMP level to inhibit motor switching, we next asked which endogenous DGCs or PDEs of P. aeruginosa are involved in the regulation of motor switching. Identifying the PDEs that control motor switching can be achieved by screening pde knockout mutants for inhibited motor switching, assuming the PDEs are constitutively expressed and active. However, identifying the DGCs that regulate motor switching is not so straightforward because we found that it is not possible to draw convincing conclusion from the dgc mutants because the effect of dgc deletion on flagellar switching seemed to be very subtle and rather difficult to reproduce among different batches of cultivated cells. Although the deletion of a pde gene can have a very strong phenotype because of the drastically suppressed motor switching as we show below, the deletion of a dgc gene does not alter the motor switching and swimming trajectory in a significant manner. For this reason, here we only focus on identifying the PDEs that regulate flagellar motor switching. In P. aeruginosa, there are 22 proteins that are known or predicted to contain an enzymatically active EAL or HD-GYP–based PDE domain for degrading c-di-GMP (32Rao F. Yang Y. Qi Y. Liang Z.X.

We performed cell-tethering assays for this comprehensive set of 22 pde transposon mutant strains to identify the ones that exhibit inhibited motor switching. We found that although a majority of pde::Tn mutants exhibited similar motor switching behavior as PAO1, with the cells capable of switching stochastically between the CW and CCW rotation modes (Fig. 3A), the three mutant strains dipA::Tn, nbdA::Tn, and rbdA::Tn exhibited drastically decreased frequency of motor switching as shown by the bimodal or trimodal pattern observed (Fig. 3, A and B). The dipA::Tn strain showed the greatest deviation from PAO1, with ∼30% of the cells exhibiting unidirectional rotation and 70% exhibiting highly biased CW or CCW rotation. Also, unlike the PAO1 cells, the rbdA::Tn and nbdA::Tn cells exhibited highly biased CW or CCW rotation. Native promoter-driven expression of dipA, nbdA, and rbdA in the respective Tn mutant relieved the inhibition on motor switching (Fig. 3C), confirming that the suppression on motor switching is attributed to the absence of the PDEs. The three pde genes code for the multidomain proteins RbdA, NbdA, and DipA, respectively, with RbdA and NbdA containing a transmembrane domain (Fig. 3D). All three proteins were shown to contain an enzymatically active EAL domain and only function as c-di-GMP–degrading PDE without detectable DGC activity (37Roy A.B. Petrova O.E. Sauer K.

The aim was to investigate whether high perceived stress among young adults is associated with social interaction behaviour both via face-to-face interaction and via smartphone interaction. The data was derived from the Copenhagen Network Study, where 535 first-year students (mean age 21.3, 77% male) self-reported on perceived stress at baseline and were subsequently followed for three months with continuous Bluetooth recordings of face-to-face interactions and smartphone interactions (calls and texts) measuring the network size, frequency, and duration of interactions. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between perceived stress (high/low) and social interactions adjusting for sex, age, and personality traits. Participants with high perceived stress were more likely to engage in a larger call and text network and have a higher call and text frequency compared to individuals with low perceived stress. We found a non-statistically significant tendency that participants with a high perceived stress level spend less time meeting face to face with peers. Stressed students engage in frequent smartphone interaction which may be explained by a social support seeking behaviour, or it may be that accommodating a large network via the smartphone is stress-inducing."
https://openalex.org/W2965071456,"A knowledge brokering (KB) intervention was implemented in Burkina Faso. By creating partnerships with health system actors in one district, the broker was expected to assess their knowledge needs, survey the literature to provide the most recent research evidence, produce various knowledge translation tools, and support them in using research to improve their actions. The purpose of this study was to analyze the key factors that influenced the KB project and to make recommendations for future initiatives.The qualitative design involved a single case study in which the KB intervention implementation was evaluated retrospectively. Data came from interviews with the intervention team (n = 4) and with various actors involved in the intervention (n = 16). Data from formative evaluations conducted during the KB implementation and observation data from a two-month field mission were also used. Two conceptual frameworks were combined to guide the analysis: the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (Damschroder et al., 2009) and the Ecological Framework (Durlak & DuPre, 2008).Various KB activities were conducted during the first two years of implementation at the local level. The project came to an early end following vain efforts to relocate the intervention at the central level in order to further influence the policy process. Certain shortcomings in the implementation team negatively influenced the implementation: inadequate leadership, no shared vision regarding the reorientation of the intervention, challenges related to the KB role, and lack of frank communications internally. Other impediments to the intervention's deployment included local actors' lack of decision-making authority, the unavailability of resources and of organizational incentives for involvement in the KB intervention, and contextual challenges in accessing the central level. However, the KB strategy presented several strengths: collaborative development, support provided to local partners by the broker, and training opportunities and support provided to the broker.More attention must be paid to intervention planning, partners' engagement, human, financial and technical resources availability, continuous development of skills and of communications within the KB team, and periodic assessment of potential obstacles related to the complexity of the system within which the intervention has been implemented. Using implementation science frameworks when developing KB strategies in the West African context should be promoted."

The Ecological Model of Active Living was proposed to examine whether individuals participate in active living. The purpose of this study was to understand the determinants of physical activity and create a predictive path model of the intrapersonal, perceived environment, behavior settings, and policy environment domains. Data were obtained from open government data and questionnaires, including the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Health Belief Model Inventory, Physical Activity Neighborhood Environment Survey, and Accessibility of Open Spaces. Participants comprised 1085 healthy adults who completed a self-reported internet survey. An analysis of the intrapersonal domain revealed that the variables of female, an older age, and a low educational level, and individuals with obesity or cardiometabolic diseases presented lower odds ratios for active living. We found significant statistical support for our path model (The Ecological Model of Active Living), with a predictive power of 23.1%. The predictive path model is a good approach to quantitatively measure the impacts of various determinants on active living that suggests further lines of research in approaches for modeling relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2966567791,"To present a three-dimensional non-parametric method for detecting scleral asymmetry using corneoscleral topography data that are free of edge-effect artefacts.The study included 88 participants aged 23 to 65 years (37.7±9.7), 47 women and 41 men. The eye topography data were exported from the Eye Surface Profiler software in MATLAB binary data container format then processed by custom built MATLAB codes entirely independent from the profiler software. Scleral asymmetry was determined initially from the unprocessed topography before being determined again after removing the edge-effect noise. Topography data were levelled around the limbus, then edge-effect was eliminated using a robust statistical moving median technique. In addition to comparing raw elevation data, scleral elevation was also compared through fitting a sphere to every single scleral surface and determining the relative elevation from the best-fit sphere reference surface.When considering the averaged raw topography elevation data in the scleral section of the eye at radius 8 mm, the average raw elevations of the right eyes' sclera were -1.5±1.77, -1.87±2.12, -1.36±1.82 and -1.57±1.87 mm. In the left eyes at the same radius the average raw elevations were -1.62±1.78, -1.82±2.07, -1.28±1.76 and -1.68±1.93 mm. While, when considering the average raw elevation of the sclera after removing the edge effect, the average raw elevations of the right eyes were -3.71±0.25, -4.06±0.23, -3.95±0.19 and -3.95±0.23 mm. In the left eyes at the same radius the average raw elevations were -3.71±0.19, -3.97±0.22, -3.96±0.19 and -3.96±0.18 mm in the nasal, temporal, superior and inferior sides respectively. Maximum raw elevation asymmetry in the averaged scleral raw elevation was 1.6647±0.9015 mm in right eyes and 1.0358±0.6842 mm in left eyes, both detected at -38° to the nasal side. Best-fit sphere-based relative elevation showed that sclera is more elevated in three main meridians at angles -40°, 76°, and 170° in right eyes and -40°, 76°, and 170° in left eyes, all measured from the nasal meridian. Maximum recorded relative elevation asymmetries were 0.0844±0.0355 mm and 0.068±0.0607 mm at angular positions 76° and 63.5° for right and left eyes in turn.It is not possible to use corneoscleral topography data to predict the scleral shape without considering a method of removing the edge-effect from the topography data. The nasal side of the sclera is higher than the temporal side, therefore, rotationally symmetric scleral contact lenses are more likely to be translated towards the temporal side. The scleral shape is best described by levelled raw elevation rather than relative elevation."
https://openalex.org/W2965077646,"In the alcoholic fermentation process, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains present differences in their nitrogen consumption profiles, these phenotypic outcomes have complex genetic and molecular architectures. In this sense, variations in nitrogen signaling pathways regulated by TORC1 represent one of the main sources of phenotypic diversity in nitrogen consumption. This emphasizes the possible roles that allelic variants from the TORC1 pathway have in the nitrogen consumption differences observed in yeast during the alcoholic fermentation. Here, we studied the allelic diversity in the TORC1 pathway across four yeast strains and determined how these polymorphisms directly impact nitrogen consumption during alcoholic fermentation. Using a reciprocal hemizygosity approach combined with phenotyping under fermentative conditions, we found that allelic variants of GTR1, TOR2, SIT4, SAP185, EAP1, NPR1 and SCH9 underlie differences in the ammonium and amino acids consumption phenotypes. Among these, GTR1 alleles from the Wine/European and West African genetic backgrounds showed the greatest effects on ammonium and amino acid consumption, respectively. Furthermore, we identified allelic variants of SAP185, TOR2, SCH9 and NPR1 from an oak isolate that increased the amino acid consumption preference over ammonium; representing putative candidates coming from a non-domesticated strain that could be used for genetic improvement programs. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that a large number of allelic variants within the TORC1 pathway significantly impacts on regulatory mechanisms of nitrogen assimilation during alcoholic fermentation."
https://openalex.org/W2966185215,"Recoding of UGA codons as selenocysteine (Sec) codons in selenoproteins depends on a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) in the 3′-UTR of mRNAs of eukaryotic selenoproteins. SECIS-binding protein 2 (SECISBP2) increases the efficiency of this process. Pathogenic mutations in SECISBP2 reduce selenoprotein expression and lead to phenotypes associated with the reduction of deiodinase activities and selenoprotein N expression in humans. Two functions have been ascribed to SECISBP2: binding of SECIS elements in selenoprotein mRNAs and facilitation of co-translational Sec insertion. To separately probe both functions, we established here two mouse models carrying two pathogenic missense mutations in Secisbp2 previously identified in patients. We found that the C696R substitution in the RNA-binding domain abrogates SECIS binding and does not support selenoprotein translation above the level of a complete Secisbp2 null mutation. The R543Q missense substitution located in the selenocysteine insertion domain resulted in residual activity and caused reduced selenoprotein translation, as demonstrated by ribosomal profiling to determine the impact on UGA recoding in individual selenoproteins. We found, however, that the R543Q variant is thermally unstable in vitro and completely degraded in the mouse liver in vivo, while being partially functional in the brain. The moderate impairment of selenoprotein expression in neurons led to astrogliosis and transcriptional induction of genes associated with immune responses. We conclude that differential SECISBP2 protein stability in individual cell types may dictate clinical phenotypes to a much greater extent than molecular interactions involving a mutated amino acid in SECISBP2."

As proof of concept, this work presents testosterone production from 4-androstene-3,17-dione by tailoring innate catabolic enzymes of the steroid catabolism inside the strain. A R. ruber quadruple mutant was constructed in order to avoid the breakage of the steroid nucleus. At the same time, an inducible expression vector for this strain was developed. The 17-ketoreductase gene from the fungus Cochliobolus lunatus was cloned and overexpressed in this vector. The engineered strain was able to produce testosterone from 4-androstene-3,17-dione using glucose for cofactor regeneration with a molar conversion of 61%. It is important to note that 91% of the testosterone was secreted outside the cell after 3 days of cell biotransformation. The results support the idea that Rhodococcus ruber Chol-4 can be metabolically engineered and can be used for the production of steroid intermediates."

https://openalex.org/W2966476223,"Background The provision of health care in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) is recognized as a significant contributor to economic growth and also impacts individual families at a microeconomic level. The primary goal of our study was to examine the relationship between surgical conditions in children and the poverty trajectories of either falling into or coming out of poverty of families across Somaliland. Methods This work used the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) tool, a validated household, cross-sectional survey designed to determine the burden of surgical conditions within a community. We collected information on household demographic characteristics, including financial information, and surgical condition history on children younger than 16 years of age. To assess poverty trajectories over time, we measured household assets using the Stages of Progress framework. Results We found there were substantial fluxes in poverty across Somaliland over the study period. We confirmed our study hypothesis and found that the presence of a surgical condition in a child itself, regardless of whether surgical care was provided, either reduced the chances of moving out of poverty or increased the chances of moving towards poverty. Conclusion Our study shows that the presence of a surgical condition in a child is a strong singular predictor of poverty descent rather than upward mobility, suggesting that this stressor can limit the capacity of a family to improve its economic status. Our findings further support many existing macroeconomic and microeconomic analyses that surgical care in LMICs offers financial risk protection against impoverishment."
https://openalex.org/W2965928287,"The hippocampus is a well-known target of thyroid hormone (TH; e.g., 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine-T3) and glucocorticoid (GC; e.g., corticosterone-CORT) action. Despite evidence that TH and GC play critical roles in neural development and function, few studies have identified genes and patterns of gene regulation influenced by the interaction of these hormones at a genome-wide scale. In this study we investigated gene regulation by T3, CORT, and T3 + CORT in the mouse hippocampus-derived cell line HT-22. We treated cells with T3, CORT, or T3 + CORT for 4 hr before cell harvest and RNA isolation for microarray analysis. We identified 9 genes regulated by T3, 432 genes by CORT, and 412 genes by T3 + CORT. Among the 432 CORT-regulated genes, there were 203 genes that exhibited an altered CORT response in the presence of T3, suggesting that T3 plays a significant role in modulating CORT-regulated genes. We also found 80 genes synergistically induced, and 73 genes synergistically repressed by T3 + CORT treatment. We performed in silico analysis using publicly available mouse neuronal chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing datasets and identified a considerable number of synergistically regulated genes with TH receptor and GC receptor peaks mapping within 1 kb of chromatin marks indicative of hormone-responsive enhancer regions. Functional annotation clustering of synergistically regulated genes reveal the relevance of proteasomal-dependent degradation, neuroprotective effect of growth hormones, and neuroinflammatory responses as key pathways to how TH and GC may coordinately influence learning and memory. Taken together, our transcriptome data represents a promising exploratory dataset for further study of common molecular mechanisms behind synergistic TH and GC gene regulation, and identify specific genes and their role in processes mediated by cross-talk between the thyroid and stress axes in a mammalian hippocampal model system."
https://openalex.org/W2966739599,"With the advent of continuous antiretroviral therapy, HIV has become a complex chronic, rather than acute, condition. The Chronic Care Model (CCM) provides an integrated approach to the delivery of care for people with chronic conditions that could therefore be applied to the delivery of care for people living with HIV. Our objective was to assess the alignment of HIV care settings with the CCM. We conducted a mixed methods study to explore structures, organization and care processes of Canadian HIV care settings. The quantitative results of phase one are published elsewhere. For phase two, we conducted semi-structured interviews with key informants from 12 HIV care settings across Canada. Irrespective of composition of the care setting or its location, HIV care in Canada is well aligned with several components of the CCM, most prominently in the areas of linkage to community resources and delivery system design with inter-professional team-based care. We propose the need for improvements in the availability of electronic clinical information systems and self-management support services to support better care delivery and health outcomes among people living with HIV in Canada."
https://openalex.org/W2966819939,"The FMR1 premutation (PM) is relatively common in the general population. Evidence suggests that PM carriers may exhibit subtle differences in specific cognitive and language abilities. This study examined potential mechanisms underlying such differences through the study of gaze and language coordination during a language processing task (rapid automatized naming; RAN) among female carriers of the FMR1 PM. RAN taps a complex set of underlying neuropsychological mechanisms, with breakdowns implicating processing disruptions in fundamental skills that support higher order language and executive functions, making RAN (and analysis of gaze/language coordination during RAN) a potentially powerful paradigm for revealing the phenotypic expression of the FMR1 PM. Forty-eight PM carriers and 56 controls completed RAN on an eye tracker, where they serially named arrays of numbers, letters, colors, and objects. Findings revealed a pattern of inefficient language processing in the PM group, including a greater number of eye fixations (namely, visual regressions) and reduced eye-voice span (i.e., the eyes' lead over the voice) relative to controls. Differences were driven by performance in the latter half of the RAN arrays, when working memory and processing load are the greatest, implicating executive skills. RAN deficits were associated with broader social-communicative difficulties among PM carriers, and with FMR1-related molecular genetic variation (higher CGG repeat length, lower activation ratio, and increased levels of the fragile X mental retardation protein; FMRP). Findings contribute to an understanding of the neurocognitive profile of PM carriers and indicate specific gene-behavior associations that implicate the role of the FMR1 gene in language-related processes."
https://openalex.org/W2965246344,"Micro-RNA (miR)-122 is a promising exploratory biomarker for detecting liver injury in preclinical and clinical studies. Elevations in serum or plasma have been associated with viral and autoimmune hepatitis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatocellular carcinoma, and drug-induced liver injury (DILI). However, these associations were primarily based upon population differences between the disease state and the controls. Thus, little is known about the variability and subsequent variance components of circulating miR-122 in healthy humans, which has implications for the practical use of the biomarker clinically. To address this, we set out to perform variance components analysis of miR-122 in a cohort of 40 healthy volunteers. Employing a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay to detect miR-122 and other circulating miRNAs in human serum, the relative expression of miR-122 was determined using two different normalization approaches: to the mean expression of a panel of several endogenous miRNAs identified using an adaptive algorithm (miRA-Norm) and to the expression of an exogenous miRNA control (Caenorhabditis elegans miR-39). Results from a longitudinal study in healthy volunteers (N = 40) demonstrated high variability with 117- and 111-fold 95% confidence reference interval, respectively. This high variability of miR-122 in serum appeared to be due in part to ethnicity, as 95% confidence reference intervals were approximately three-fold lower in volunteers that identified as Caucasian relative to those that identified as Non-Caucasian. Variance analysis revealed equivalent contributions of intra- and inter-donor variability to miR-122. Surprisingly, miR-122 exhibited the highest variability compared to other 36 abundant miRNAs in circulation; the next variable miRNA, miR-133a, demonstrated a 45- to 62-fold reference interval depending on normalization approaches. In contrast, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity levels in this population exhibited a 5-fold total variance, with 80% of this variance due to inter-donor sources. In conclusion, miR-122 demonstrated higher than expected variability in serum from healthy volunteers, which has implications for its potential utility as a prospective biomarker of liver damage or injury."
https://openalex.org/W2966674042,"The flavin transferase ApbE plays essential roles in bacterial physiology, covalently incorporating FMN cofactors into numerous respiratory enzymes that use the integrated cofactors as electron carriers. In this work we performed a detailed kinetic and structural characterization of Vibrio cholerae WT ApbE and mutants of the conserved residue His-257, to understand its role in substrate binding and in the catalytic mechanism of this family. Bi-substrate kinetic experiments revealed that ApbE follows a random Bi Bi sequential kinetic mechanism, in which a ternary complex is formed, indicating that both substrates must be bound to the enzyme for the reaction to proceed. Steady-state kinetic analyses show that the turnover rates of His-257 mutants are significantly smaller than those of WT ApbE, and have increased Km values for both substrates, indicating that the His-257 residue plays important roles in catalysis and in enzyme-substrate complex formation. Analyses of the pH dependence of ApbE activity indicate that the pKa of the catalytic residue (pKES1) increases by 2 pH units in the His-257 mutants, suggesting that this residue plays a role in substrate deprotonation. The crystal structures of WT ApbE and an H257G mutant were determined at 1.61 and 1.92 Å resolutions, revealing that His-257 is located in the catalytic site and that the substitution does not produce major conformational changes.

https://openalex.org/W2964499279,"Bile acid reflux is known to be associated with the development of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), yet the role of specific bile acids and the mechanism behind the metaplastic changes is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that multi-layered glandular structures at the squamo-columnar junction in mice contain multiple cell lineages, which resemble the human esophageal submucosal gland ducts. Exposing mice to patient's refluxates induced expansion of multi-layered glandular structures and development of columnar metaplasia at the squamo-columnar junction. The glycine conjugated bile acids induced an intestinal type of metaplasia more typical for Barrett's esophagus. Through lineage tracing, we excluded the involvement of K5+, DCLK1+, and LGR5+ progenitor cells as the primary source in the development of the glandular metaplastic epithelium. We show that the mechanism behind development of metaplasia involves crypt fission and may be independent of stem cell proliferation. Our findings support the hypothesis that in humans, BE arises from non-squamous cells residing in submucosal gland ducts and that induction of intestinal type of metaplasia is most effectively induced by glycine-conjugated bile acids. These novel insights may lead to more effective strategies to prevent development of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2964652959,"High-resolution structural analysis of flexible proteins is frequently challenging and requires the synergistic application of different experimental techniques. For these proteins, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) allows for a quantitative assessment and modeling of potentially flexible and heterogeneous structural states. Here, we report SAXS characterization of the condensin HEAT-repeat subunit Ycg1Cnd3 in solution, complementing currently available high-resolution crystallographic models. We show that the free Ycg1 subunit is flexible in solution but becomes considerably more rigid when bound to its kleisin-binding partner protein Brn1Cnd2. The analysis of SAXS and dynamic and static multiangle light scattering data furthermore reveals that Ycg1 tends to oligomerize with increasing concentrations in the absence of Brn1. Based on these data, we present a model of the free Ycg1 protein constructed by normal mode analysis, as well as tentative models of Ycg1 dimers and tetramers. These models enable visualization of the conformational transitions that Ycg1 has to undergo to adopt a closed rigid shape and thereby create a DNA-binding surface in the condensin complex."
https://openalex.org/W2964505745,"Biological systems manifest continuous weak autoluminescence, which is present even in the absence of external stimuli. Since this autoluminescence arises from internal metabolic and physiological processes, several works suggested that it could carry information in the time series of the detected photon counts. However, there is little experimental work which would show any difference of this signal from random Poisson noise and some works were prone to artifacts due to lacking or improper reference signals. Here we apply rigorous statistical methods and advanced reference signals to test the hypothesis whether time series of autoluminescence from germinating mung beans display any intrinsic correlations. Utilizing the fractional Brownian bridge that employs short samples of time series in the method kernel, we suggest that the detected autoluminescence signal from mung beans is not totally random, but it seems to involve a process with a negative memory. Our results contribute to the development of the rigorous methodology of signal analysis of photonic biosignals."

Three substantive themes, namely, the need to obtain health-related knowledge, the need to obtain care and support, and the needs of those who cannot perform self-care, were identified from the qualitative data. The participants shared valuable insights into their needs during home-based rehabilitation after hip replacement and provided potential suggestions.Patients undergoing home-based rehabilitation after hip replacement have several strong needs and lack proper guidance. The initial and continuous engagement of rehabilitation professionals and the establishment of related policies based on patient's needs are potential approaches for improving the effectiveness of home-based rehabilitation after hip replacement."
https://openalex.org/W2966620203,"This study explored gender differences in correct response rates and response times on a task involving left or right arrow selection and another involving the transformation of mental rotation of the hand. We recruited 15 healthy, right-handed men (age 24.5 ± 6.4) and 15 healthy, right-handed women (age 21.3 ± 4.9). For the tasks, we used pictures of left and right arrows and 32 hand pictures (left and right, palm and back) placed in cons (each at 45° from 0° to 315°). Hand and arrow pictures alternated and were shown at random. Participants decided as quickly as possible whether each picture was left or right. To compare the time taken for the transformation of mental rotation of the hand, we subtracted the average arrow response time from that for the left and right hand pictures for each participant. Correct response rates did not differ significantly between men and women or left and right for either arrow or hand pictures. Regardless of gender, the response time was longer for the left arrow picture than right arrow picture. The response time for the hand picture was longest for both men and women for pictures at rotation angles that were most difficult to align with participants' hands. While there was no difference between men's responses for left and right hand pictures, the responses of women were longer for left than right hand pictures and also than those of men. These findings suggest that both men and women mainly perform the hand mental rotation task with implicit motor imagery. On the other hand, the gender difference in performance might be explained by the difference in balance with other strategies, such as visual imagery, and by cognitive, neurophysiological, and morphological differences."
https://openalex.org/W2966646280,"Background Ageing is becoming a considerable public health burden in China, which produces great societal development challenges. Healthy and active longevity could ease the ageing burden on families and communities. To date, most studies of the oldest-old distribution are focused on a simple scale from spatial perspective, and the multi-scale spatio-temporal clusters trend in the oldest-old population has not yet been determined. Thus, the objective in present study is to use a new method to evaluate the spatio-temporal pattern and detect the risk clusters in the oldest-old population from three scales. Methods Individuals aged 65 years or older and individuals aged 80 years or older on three scales in China from 2000 to 2010 were used. The exploratory spatial data analysis was performed using Moran’s I statistic, and the pattern of the oldest-old clusters among humans was examined by using the spatial scan statistical method. Then, spatial stratified heterogeneity was used to explore the factors affecting the spatial heterogeneity of the oldest-old population. Results The oldest-old index in the southeast coastal areas is higher than that in the northwest inland areas in China. A three-ladder terrain distribution of the oldest-old index from west to east is obvious. The overall pattern of the oldest-old index evolves from a “concave” shape to an “east-west uplift, and northern collapse” shape. Space-time analysis revealed that high-risk areas were concentrated in five regions: the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, the Southeast Coast, Sichuan and Chongqing, and the Central Plains. The oldest-old cluster at different scales shows a similar pattern, but local differences exist. The risk at the prefecture scale and county scale is greater than at the interprovincial scale; the sublevel can identify clusters that have not been identified at the previous level, especially the bordering areas of prefectures and counties; and more risk units and greater relative risk are found in urban areas than in rural areas. Conclusions The results emphasized that spatial scan statistics can be used to estimate the spatial clusters of the oldest-old people. The detection of these clusters might be highly useful in the surveillance of the ageing phenomenon, thus helping local public health authorities measure the population burden at all locations, identifying geographical areas that require more attention, and evaluating the impacts of intervention programs."

Research on social identity and stereotypes has documented that when individuals feel that their social group is negatively stereotyped in a domain, their performance declines, which can reinforce discrimination. In an effort to break the cycle of negative stereotypes, we remind Roma subjects of either Roma or non-Roma role models. We find that the activation of a Roma’s ethnicity reduces cognitive performance. In contrast, Roma exposed to Roma role models outperform those reminded of their ethnicity and of non-Roma role models. We then attempt to understand the channels through which social identity and role models affect performance. We show that priming the identity of a Roma has a direct effect on confidence, decreasing performance."

A growing number of heritage sites employ technologies, such as cameras and electronic ticket-checking systems, to monitor user levels, but data collected by these monitoring technologies are often under-utilized. In this study, we illustrated how to integrate data from hot spots by camera-captured monitoring and entrance counts to manage use levels at a World Heritage Site in Southeastern China. 6,930 photos of a congestion hotspot (scenic outlook on a trail) were collected within the park at a 10-minute interval over 105 days from January to November 2017. The entrance counts were used to predict daily average and maximum use level at the hotspots. Results showed that the average use level at the congestion hotspot did not exceed the use limit mandated by the park administration agency. However, from 9:20 am to 12:00 pm, the use level at hotspots exceeded visitor preferred use level. Visitor use level was significantly higher at the hotspot during a major Chinese “Golden Week”. The daily entrance counts significantly predicted the average and maximum use level at the hotspot. Based on our findings, park managers can achieve the management goals by permitting the corresponding number of visitors passing the entrances. The gap manifested the complexities in visitor capacity management at high-use World Heritage Sites and other protected areas and calls for innovative monitoring and management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2965242927,"Sensorineural hearing loss (HL) is one of the most common public health problems, and its prevalence increases with increasing life expectancy. An association between HL and metabolic syndrome (MetS) is suspected. Although previous epidemiological studies have investigated the association between the two variables, there have been conflicting conclusions. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between the presence of MetS-and individual components of MetS-and HL, using a longitudinal design and a large-scale population.A total of 17,513,555 individuals who underwent national health screening between January 2009 and December 2010 were identified. Subject data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service were reviewed. A total of 11,457,931 subjects were ultimately included in the analysis. Baseline comorbidities were defined according to the ICD-10 code from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service data. If the participants had an ICD-10 code for HL during the follow-up, they were defined as having incident HL. Criteria for MetS adhered to the revised National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III.There were 7,574,432 subjects without MetS and 3,883,499 with MetS. The incidence of HL in subjects without MetS and with MetS was 1.3% and 1.8% at 1 year, 4.1% and 5.2% at 3 years, and 6.8% and 8.6% at 5 years, respectively (P < 0.001). However, multivariate analyses revealed a negative association. Analyses according to the components of MetS demonstrated a positive association for those associated with dyslipidemia; however, the others exhibited an inverse association with HL. We also performed analyses using 4 groups according to the presence of MetS and the components of dyslipidemia. Univariate analysis revealed a positive association between the presence of MetS and HL; however, multivariate analysis revealed a positive association between the presence of dyslipidemia components and HL, regardless of the presence of MetS.Among the components of MetS, the association between low HDL or high TG levels and HL was most apparent. It is useful to evaluate each MetS component in isolation, such as the presence of low HDL or high TG levels, rather than the presence of MetS as a cluster of components."

Structural analysis of a Vibrio phospholipase reveals an unusual Ser–His–chloride catalytic triadJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 294Issue 30PreviewPhospholipases can disrupt host membranes and are important virulence factors in many pathogens. VvPlpA is a phospholipase A2 secreted by Vibrio vulnificus and essential for virulence. Its homologs, termed thermolabile hemolysins (TLHs), are widely distributed in Vibrio bacteria, but no structural information for this virulence factor class is available. Herein, we report the crystal structure of VvPlpA to 1.4-Å resolution, revealing that VvPlpA contains an N-terminal domain of unknown function and a C-terminal phospholipase domain and that these two domains are packed closely together. Full-Text PDF Open Access Hydrolytic reactions in biology are ubiquitous and essential counterparts of the condensation reactions that drive the assembly of complex molecules from their building blocks. Fifty years ago, two groups studying the structural basis for the hydrolysis of proteins by the archetypical but structurally dissimilar proteases chymotrypsin (1Blow D.M. Birktoft J.J. Hartley B.S. Role of a buried acid group in the mechanism of action of chymotrypsin.Nature. 1969; 221 (5764436): 337-34010.1038/221337a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar) and subtilisin (2Wright C.S. Alden R.A. Kraut J. Structure of subtilisin BPN′ at 2.5 angstrom resolution.Nature. 1969; 221 (5763076): 235-24210.1038/221235a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) described what has come to be known as the “catalytic triad.” This configuration of Ser, His, and Asp residues, first reported in the context of two very different protein folds, provides the machinery for hydrolysis of peptide bonds, with the His accepting a proton from the Ser hydroxyl group to generate a strong nucleophile and the Asp positioned to stabilize the developing charge on the His. Twenty years later, the same constellation of amino acids was described for a lipase (3Blow D. Enzymology: more of the catalytic triad.Nature. 1990; 343 (2304545): 694-69510.1038/343694a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and over the years numerous variations on this biochemistry textbook classic have been observed. For example, Cys can substitute for Ser, or Glu for Asp; in some enzymes, only a dyad is necessary. More recently, the substrate itself has been proposed to provide the nucleophile in a novel variation on the catalytic triad theme: An enzyme that catalyzes the inactivating acetylation of the aminoglycoside antibiotic sisomicin provides the His and Glu of this unconventional catalytic triad, and the substrate -NH2 is the nucleophile (4Kumar P. Serpersu E.H. Cuneo M.J. A low-barrier hydrogen bond mediates antibiotic resistance in a noncanonical catalytic triad.Sci. Adv. 2018; 4 (29632894)eaas866710.1126/sciadv.aas8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Now another adaptation is described in this issue of the Journal of Biological Chemistry, in which a Cl− comes to the rescue of an incomplete triad and sits precisely where one would expect the carboxylate of an Asp to be located in the canonical catalytic triad (5Wan Y. Liu C. Ma Q. Structural analysis of a vibrio phospholipase reveals an unusual Ser-His-chloride catalytic triad.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 (31073025): 11391-1140110.1074/jbc.RA119.008280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Wan et al. had taken interest in the VvPlpA phospholipase from the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus, an opportunistic pathogen that unfortunately is occasionally found in oysters harvested from the Gulf Coast of the United States. Some VvPlpA homologs are thought to be virulence factors. However, no structures were available for these proteins, which are annotated as thermolabile hemolysins. Sequence lineups revealed that in VvPlpA and a few other members of this subgroup of the Ser-Glu-Asn-His (SGNH) hydrolase superfamily, which also harbor the catalytic triad first described for chymotrypsin, there is a Gly, rather than the typical Asp. To gain insight into thermolabile hemolysins and to potentially inform antibacterial design, the authors solved the crystal structure of VvPlpA. Their 1.4 Å resolution structure revealed nonprotein spherical density, which could not be attributed to an oxygen atom of a water molecule, as the peak height was consistent with something with more than 8 electrons. After ruling out metal ions (the usual suspects when one is trying to interpret nonprotein, spherical density), the investigators attributed the density to Cl−. This assignment is consistent with the peak height in the electron density map, an anomalous signal that could be due to Cl−, and the observed coordination geometry. In addition, the investigators were able to substitute bromide for the chloride and collect the X-ray data at the Br absorption edge. Indeed, the spherical density gave the expected high σ peaks in both the difference Fourier and anomalous maps calculated with the Br-soaked crystal X-ray diffraction data. The investigators next explored whether the ion plays a role in catalysis. Their data indicate that enzyme activity depends upon chloride concentration. In what can be described as essentially a “reverse” chemical rescue experiment, they also generated the G389D mutant. Consistent with their hypothesis, the activity of the mutant enzyme is not dependent on the presence of chloride. Moreover, the structure revealed the classic catalytic triad with the carboxylate occupying the position of the Cl− in the WT enzyme. A quick search of the Protein Data Bank reveals thousands of structures in which Cl− has been ascribed to a ligand density. Given that chloride concentrations can range from 5 to 200 mm in the cell and that NaCl is often present in buffers, the identification of chloride ions as ligands in protein structures is logical. Although the anion has been suggested to play accessory roles in catalysis in other enzymes (6Maurus R. Begum A. Kuo H.H. Racaza A. Numao S. Andersen C. Tams J.W. Vind J. Overall C.M. Withers S.G. Brayer G.D. Structural and mechanistic studies of chloride induced activation of human pancreatic alpha-amylase.Protein Sci. 2005; 14 (15722449): 743-75510.1110/ps.041079305Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), this report appears to be the first account of Cl− serving as an essential part of catalytic machinery. This observation gives one pause to wonder if there might be more instances where Cl− is an active participant in catalysis, instances that are easily overlooked because the ion is often present in enzyme assays as a buffer component. A more systematic approach to analyzing the depositions in the Protein Data Bank might reveal additional Cl ions suspiciously occupying active site cavities. As the Vibrio phospholipase promotes lysis of the host cells and is a virulence factor, it is tempting to speculate that the need for chemical rescue by chloride might be exploited to engineer a highly specific inhibitor for this particular serine hydrolase by incorporating the halogen into a substrate mimic. Halogens are commonly employed in medicinal chemistry and are staples in drug development (7Shinada N.K. de Brevern A.G. Schmidtke P. Halogens in protein-ligand binding mechanism: a structural perspective.J. Med. Chem. 2019; (31117513)10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b01453Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For additional specificity, one might also exploit the fact that in this hydrolase structure, which lacks substrate or a substrate mimic, the requisite oxyanion hole, a key feature of catalytic triad active sites, is obscured by an atypical conformation of one the invariant amino acids that define it (Asn-247). Thus, an inhibitor might also incorporate motifs that lock the enzyme into this inactive conformation. On this fiftieth anniversary of the discovery of the catalytic triad, a wonderfully adaptable and powerful hydrolytic apparatus, we find yet another example of how it can be modified, one in which enzyme activity is rescued by a common chemical component of the cell."

It is thought that by administering IL15 in complex with its cognate receptor alpha chain (IL15Rα) its biological activity could be increased manifold. We produced a fusion protein of mouse IL15Rα and the F8 antibody, that targets the alternatively-spliced extra-domain A (EDA) of fibronectin, which is overexpressed in many types of cancer. The fusion protein F8IL15Rα was cloned, expressed and characterized in vitro and its ability to bind to mouse IL15 was assessed with both size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments. Furthermore, mouse and human IL15 and their corresponding Fc fused IL15Rα subunits were purchased, characterized and used to compare the capacity of F8IL15Rα to generate complexes. Surprisingly, none of the IL15Rα fusion proteins showed IL15 complexation on SEC. However, on SPR, F8IL15Rα displayed the ability to bind IL15. In a cell-based activity assay none of the IL15Rα fusions were able to increase cellular proliferation in combination with IL15 compared to IL15 alone. A better understanding of the molecular requirements for effective IL15 signalling are likely to be important for the development of IL15-based biopharmaceuticals."

Various dynamic changes in the infectious bacteria inside the peritoneal cavity after CLP were found. While knockout of Tlr5 and NF-κB impaired the ability of bacterial clearance inside the peritoneal cavity for some kinds of bacteria found in the C57BL/6 mice, the knockout of Tlr4 enhanced clearance for other kinds of bacteria, and they presented excessive abundance in the peritoneal cavity despite their scarce abundance in the stool.NF-κB and TLRs are involved in bacterial clearance and in the expression pattern of the bacterial abundance inside the peritoneal cavity during polymicrobial infection."

These movies, which are often a delightful mix of science fiction and classic themes of good versus evil, captivate and entertain moviegoers the world over. Like the drama and intrigue of a good superhero movie, biology is full of stories that harken similar themes of immortality, epic journeys, and dazzling imagery that engage the curiosity of scientists across the globe. With studies touching upon the origins of villainous superpowers, dark transformations, and augmented sensory abilities, over the past several months some compelling stories along these lines have graced the pages of a number of journals. Tumors are the epitome of a biological supervillain. Fueled by infamous superpowers that include resistance to death, evasion of surveillance, and remodeled metabolism, the destructive path that malignancy leaves on humanity is undeniable. In certain cancers, nerve innervation has been shown to supercharge tumor initiation and jumpstart metastasis. Where these nerves come from, however, has been a mystery until now. The origin story of prostate tumor-associated nerve fibers was revealed in a recent paper published in Nature from Magnon and colleagues, and just like the origin stories of infamous supervillains, it has some rather exciting twists (Mauffrey et al., 2019Mauffrey P. Tchitchek N. Barroca V. Bemelmans A. Firlej V. Allory Y. Roméo P.H. Magnon C. Progenitors from the central nervous system drive neurogenesis in cancer.Nature. 2019; 569: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Using a mouse model of prostate cancer, Mauffrey et al., probed prostate tumors for a classic marker of neural progenitors. Then, through a series of experiments, they discovered that brain-derived neuroblasts journey from the central nervous system, traverse the blood brain barrier, and travel via blood vessel highways to ultimately infiltrate prostate tumors and drive neo-neurogenesis. While this preclinical study in mice certainly provides some tantalizing insights into the origin of tumor-associated nerves, further investigation will be needed to answer the question of how the findings relate to the development of nerves in human cancer. Every villain has a backstory that explains their transformation toward the dark side, and in the fight against cancer, the more we understand these forces of transformation, the better equipped we are to eventually prevent its villainous wrath. Just as many villains have a cunning ability to evade being caught, cancer is a shifty foe, and in small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, understanding the molecular mechanisms driving their reprogramming to neuroendocrine phenotypes could inform more effective treatments for these aggressive cancers with bleak prognoses. It was recently reported that both lung and prostate epithelial tissues develop deadly neuroendocrine features in a common reprogramming process (Park et al., 2018Park J.W. Lee J.K. Sheu K.M. Wang L. Balanis N.G. Nguyen K. Smith B.A. Cheng C. Tsai B.L. Cheng D. et al.Reprogramming normal human epithelial tissues to a common, lethal neuroendocrine cancer lineage.Science. 2018; 362: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Given that distinct human epithelial tissues use a shared mechanism, this opens up the possibility that a common arsenal of clinical weapons could be developed to combat this deadly foe. Villains and superheroes alike often benefit from creative scientists who bend the limits of technology to augment their superhuman abilities. In a study where science fiction appears to meet reality, a group of clever researchers developed nanoparticles that impart upon mice the ability to see in near-infrared (Ma et al., 2019Ma Y. Bao J. Zhang Y. Li Z. Zhou X. Wan C. Huang L. Zhao Y. Han G. Xue T. Mammalian Near-Infrared Image Vision through Injectable and Self-Powered Retinal Nanoantennae.Cell. 2019; 177: 243-255.e15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The injectable technology works by binding photoreceptors in the retina and converting normally invisible near-infrared light into a wavelength within the visible spectrum. Developing this kind of technology further could someday hold promise for repairing color blindness. While this year has proved to be a big year for superhero smash hits in the box office, intriguing developmental biology and the real-life wonders that it affords have likewise provided some inspiring stories over the past year. The researchers behind this exciting science are superheroes in their own right, and it will be interesting to see how these stories develop in the coming years to ultimately benefit humanity."
