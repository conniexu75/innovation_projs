https://openalex.org/W2046387002,"Here, we present a unifying hypothesis about how messenger RNAs, transcribed pseudogenes, and long noncoding RNAs ""talk"" to each other using microRNA response elements (MREs) as letters of a new language. We propose that this ""competing endogenous RNA"" (ceRNA) activity forms a large-scale regulatory network across the transcriptome, greatly expanding the functional genetic information in the human genome and playing important roles in pathological conditions, such as cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2126524529,"Most tumors exhibit increased glucose metabolism to lactate, however, the extent to which glucose-derived metabolic fluxes are used for alternative processes is poorly understood. Using a metabolomics approach with isotope labeling, we found that in some cancer cells a relatively large amount of glycolytic carbon is diverted into serine and glycine metabolism through phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). An analysis of human cancers showed that PHGDH is recurrently amplified in a genomic region of focal copy number gain most commonly found in melanoma. Decreasing PHGDH expression impaired proliferation in amplified cell lines. Increased expression was also associated with breast cancer subtypes, and ectopic expression of PHGDH in mammary epithelial cells disrupted acinar morphogenesis and induced other phenotypic alterations that may predispose cells to transformation. Our findings show that the diversion of glycolytic flux into a specific alternate pathway can be selected during tumor development and may contribute to the pathogenesis of human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2147900600,"New noncoding RNAs can be discovered by assembling transcripts from RNA-Seq data. Prensner et al. apply this approach across >100 prostate cancer samples to find noncoding RNAs that distinguish localized tumors from benign forms of the disease. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are emerging as key molecules in human cancer, with the potential to serve as novel markers of disease and to reveal uncharacterized aspects of tumor biology. Here we discover 121 unannotated prostate cancer–associated ncRNA transcripts (PCATs) by ab initio assembly of high-throughput sequencing of polyA+ RNA (RNA-Seq) from a cohort of 102 prostate tissues and cells lines. We characterized one ncRNA, PCAT-1, as a prostate-specific regulator of cell proliferation and show that it is a target of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). We further found that patterns of PCAT-1 and PRC2 expression stratified patient tissues into molecular subtypes distinguished by expression signatures of PCAT-1–repressed target genes. Taken together, our findings suggest that PCAT-1 is a transcriptional repressor implicated in a subset of prostate cancer patients. These findings establish the utility of RNA-Seq to identify disease-associated ncRNAs that may improve the stratification of cancer subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W1971659434,"Laura Pasqualucci and Riccardo Dalla-Favera and colleagues report exome sequencing and copy-number analyses of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Their analyses identified mutations in genes not previously implicated in DLBCL pathogenesis, such as genes encoding chromatin modifiers such as MLL2. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of human lymphoma. Although a number of structural alterations have been associated with the pathogenesis of this malignancy, the full spectrum of genetic lesions that are present in the DLBCL genome, and therefore the identity of dysregulated cellular pathways, remains unknown. By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show that the DLBCL coding genome contains, on average, more than 30 clonally represented gene alterations per case. This analysis also revealed mutations in genes not previously implicated in DLBCL pathogenesis, including those regulating chromatin methylation (MLL2; 24% of samples) and immune recognition by T cells. These results provide initial data on the complexity of the DLBCL coding genome and identify novel dysregulated pathways underlying its pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2142895007,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a cause of proteinuric kidney disease, compromising both native and transplanted kidneys. Treatment is limited because of a complex pathogenesis, including unknown serum factors. Here we report that serum soluble urokinase receptor (suPAR) is elevated in two-thirds of subjects with primary FSGS, but not in people with other glomerular diseases. We further find that a higher concentration of suPAR before transplantation underlies an increased risk for recurrence of FSGS after transplantation. Using three mouse models, we explore the effects of suPAR on kidney function and morphology. We show that circulating suPAR activates podocyte β(3) integrin in both native and grafted kidneys, causing foot process effacement, proteinuria and FSGS-like glomerulopathy. Our findings suggest that the renal disease only develops when suPAR sufficiently activates podocyte β(3) integrin. Thus, the disease can be abrogated by lowering serum suPAR concentrations through plasmapheresis, or by interfering with the suPAR-β(3) integrin interaction through antibodies and small molecules targeting either uPAR or β(3) integrin. Our study identifies serum suPAR as a circulating factor that may cause FSGS."
https://openalex.org/W2089216231,"An ongoing outbreak of exceptionally virulent Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli O104:H4 centered in Germany, has caused over 830 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and 46 deaths since May 2011. Serotype O104:H4, which has not been detected in animals, has rarely been associated with HUS in the past. To prospectively elucidate the unique characteristics of this strain in the early stages of this outbreak, we applied whole genome sequencing on the Life Technologies Ion Torrent PGM™ sequencer and Optical Mapping to characterize one outbreak isolate (LB226692) and a historic O104:H4 HUS isolate from 2001 (01-09591). Reference guided draft assemblies of both strains were completed with the newly introduced PGM™ within 62 hours. The HUS-associated strains both carried genes typically found in two types of pathogenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Phylogenetic analyses of 1,144 core E. coli genes indicate that the HUS-causing O104:H4 strains and the previously published sequence of the EAEC strain 55989 show a close relationship but are only distantly related to common EHEC serotypes. Though closely related, the outbreak strain differs from the 2001 strain in plasmid content and fimbrial genes. We propose a model in which EAEC 55989 and EHEC O104:H4 strains evolved from a common EHEC O104:H4 progenitor, and suggest that by stepwise gain and loss of chromosomal and plasmid-encoded virulence factors, a highly pathogenic hybrid of EAEC and EHEC emerged as the current outbreak clone. In conclusion, rapid next-generation technologies facilitated prospective whole genome characterization in the early stages of an outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W2093343938,"Since 1987, immortalized cells from the ovary of a Chinese hamster have been the workhorse for producing recombinant therapeutics, including monoclonal antibodies, blood factors, hormones, growth factors and enzymes. Xu et al. provide the genome sequence of the ancestral CHO-K1 cell line, which should aid in the optimization of current production cell lines. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)–derived cell lines are the preferred host cells for the production of therapeutic proteins. Here we present a draft genomic sequence of the CHO-K1 ancestral cell line. The assembly comprises 2.45 Gb of genomic sequence, with 24,383 predicted genes. We associate most of the assembled scaffolds with 21 chromosomes isolated by microfluidics to identify chromosomal locations of genes. Furthermore, we investigate genes involved in glycosylation, which affect therapeutic protein quality, and viral susceptibility genes, which are relevant to cell engineering and regulatory concerns. Homologs of most human glycosylation-associated genes are present in the CHO-K1 genome, although 141 of these homologs are not expressed under exponential growth conditions. Many important viral entry genes are also present in the genome but not expressed, which may explain the unusual viral resistance property of CHO cell lines. We discuss how the availability of this genome sequence may facilitate genome-scale science for the optimization of biopharmaceutical protein production."

However, challenging this view, differentiated somatic cell types from humans and other organisms have been reprogrammed to the pluripotent state by forced expression of a set of transcription factors (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S.

Additionally, by lineage reprogramming through ectopic expression of selected genes or cell fusion, a few studies have demonstrated that an adult cell type can be directly converted to another adult cell type (Cobaleda et al., 2007Cobaleda C.

Extreme makeover: converting one cell into another.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 382-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, all these studies involve conversion of one cell type to another within the same lineage, a major limitation for many applications. For cell-replacement therapies, the idea of reprogramming across lineages is fascinating because of its potential to rapidly generate a variety of therapeutically important and immunologically matched cell types directly from one's own easily accessible tissues, such as skin or blood. In this context, Vierbuchen et al., 2010Vierbuchen T. Ostermeier A. Pang Z.P. Kokubu Y. Südhof T.C. Wernig M. Direct conversion of fibroblasts to functional neurons by defined factors.Nature. 2010; 463: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar demonstrated that differentiated mouse cells have the capacity for changing lineage by showing direct conversion of dermal fibroblasts to functional “induced neurons” (iNs). Recently, the same group extended these findings to human fetal and postnatal fibroblasts to produce human iN (hiN) cells (Pang et al., 2011Pang Z.P. Yang N. Vierbuchen T. Ostermeier A. Fuentes D.R. Yang T.Q. Citri A. Sebastiano V. Marro S. Südhof T.C. Wernig M. Induction of human neuronal cells by defined transcription factors.Nature. 2011; Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, these hiNs formed functional synapses only when cocultured with mature mouse cortical neurons, which potentially provided additional differentiation factors. Here we show that a combination of a microRNA (miR-124) and two transcription factors (MYT1L and BRN2) is sufficient to directly reprogram postnatal and adult human primary dermal fibroblasts (mesoderm) to functional neurons (ectoderm) under precisely defined conditions without a requirement for “helper” cells from a different species. These hiNs exhibit typical neuronal morphology and marker gene expression, fire action potentials, and form functional synapses. Given the known critical roles of specific transcription factors, signaling molecules, and microRNAs in neuronal lineage determination during development or cell fate regulation, we selected 11 transcription factors (Table S1 available online) and a microRNA (miR-124) to test for their ability to convert primary postnatal human fibroblasts, BJ or CRL2097, to functional neurons. After confirming the absence of any contaminating neural or neuronal cells in BJ and CRL2097 cell cultures by immunostaining (Figure S1A available online) and RT-PCR (Figure S1B), we transduced them with lentiviruses carrying the 12 factors pooled together (12F pool, with equal representation of each). The subsequent culture conditions are depicted in the schematic diagram in Figure 1A and in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures section. Infected cells were monitored by the presence of red fluorescent protein (RFP) coexpressed with the miRNA vector (pLemiR). Immunocytochemistry for the early neuronal marker βIII-tubulin (Tuj1), performed 18 days after infection, revealed a few Tuj1/RFP double-positive cells that manifested typical neuronal morphology in the 12F-infected cultures (Figure 1B), while no such cells were observed in uninfected or GFP-control cultures (Figures S1A and S1C). These findings suggested that at least some of the factors in the 12F pool had the capacity to convert fibroblasts to human neuronal-like cells. To test whether any single factor among the 12F pool was sufficient to induce the neuronal phenotype, we transduced BJ cells with the individual factors. Although on day 18 none of these cultures displayed cells with distinctive neuronal morphology, in cultures transduced with miR-124 alone we observed a few Tuj1-positive cells with multiple, small processes that resembled neurites emanating from the soma (Figures S1D and S1E). However, even after continued culturing for over 1 month, these cells did not mature further to produce a characteristic neuronal phenotype (data not shown). Such changes resembled those observed previously when miR-124 was overexpressed in nonneuronal cells (Yu et al., 2008Yu J.Y. Chung K.H. Deo M. Thompson R.C. Turner D.L. MicroRNA miR-124 regulates neurite outgrowth during neuronal differentiation.Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 2618-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Next, we tested two-factor combinations and found that cultures transduced with miR-124 plus BRN2 (designated miB) or PAX 6 (miP) exhibited cells that were morphologically similar to those observed with miR-124 alone, but with >20-fold better efficacy (Figure S1F). Cells infected with miR-124 plus MYT1L (miM) showed a distinctive elongated morphology, unique among the combinations that we used (Figure S1G). Reasoning that some of these four factors might complement one other, we tested three-factor (3F) combinations. Remarkably, within 3 days of transduction with miBM, many RFP-positive BJ cells exhibited small, compact cell bodies with monopolar or bipolar projections and weak βIII-tubulin expression (Figure 1C). A characteristic neuronal morphology, consisting of multiple neuritic extensions and elaborate branching, became progressively obvious when these cells were allowed to mature for an additional 15 days (Figures 1D–1F). The majority of these cells displayed positive immunoreactivity for the mature neuronal markers MAP2 (55%, n = 100) (Figure 1G) and NeuN (46%, n = 100) (Figure 1H). In contrast, we did not observe any neuronal-like cells in cultures transduced with any other 3F combinations (data not shown) or in control cultures where miR-124 was replaced with scrambled, nonspecific small RNAs (Figure 1I). Also, the addition of more factors to miBM did not substantially improve the process. CRL2097 fibroblasts produced similar results to BJ cells (data not shown). An EdU incorporation assay suggested that fibroblasts destined to become hiN cells were most likely postmitotic within 24 hr of transgene induction, and thus it is likely that hiN conversion occurred in the absence of a mitotic progenitor cell stage (Figures S1H–S1P). By dividing the number of Tuj1-positive hiN cells on day 18 by the total number of cells in the starting fibroblast population, we estimated an efficiency of 4%–8% for hiN generation from BJ or CRL2097 human fibroblast cells (Figure S1Q). Furthermore, and importantly, using a doxycycline or cumate-inducible system, we found that expression of miBM for 7 days was sufficient to produce hiN cells at a frequency comparable to that of our earlier experiments (Figure 1A and Figures S2A–S2G). To functionally characterize hiN cells derived with miBM, we examined their electrophysiological properties on day 25 when the vast majority of cells displayed synapsin immunoreactivity (Figures 2A and 2B ), a marker associated with functional maturation of neuronal synapses. During whole-cell recording in voltage-clamp mode, the majority of hiN cells (60%, n = 10) exhibited rapidly inactivating inward current with a rise time of 2–3 ms, followed by outward currents, most likely corresponding to opening of voltage-dependent Na+ and K+ channels, respectively (Figure 2C). The inward current was inhibited by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (Figure 2D). In current-clamp mode, the resting membrane potential averaged about −45 mV, and with increasing time in culture the majority of cells (81%, n = 29) fired action potentials with amplitudes of ∼110 mV in response to injection of 10 to 20 pA currents (Figure 2E). Some hiN cells (∼15%) exhibited spontaneous action potentials (Figure 2F, left panel), and others (∼20%), repetitive trains of evoked action potentials (Figure 2F, right panel). We also monitored additional electrophysiological parameters, including membrane capacitance, access resistance, and total membrane resistance (Table S2A); these values are consistent with the notion that the hiN cells were maturing neurons. We next examined whether the hiN cells manifested functional neurotransmitter properties by testing for specific markers and corresponding ligand-gated currents. Immunostaining revealed that about 8% of hiN cells (n = 50) were positive for the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (Figures 2G and 2H), and 12% manifested punctuate staining for VGAT (data not shown), a protein involved in vesicular transport of GABA. Importantly, hiN cells responded to exogenous application of GABA (60%, n = 5), producing whole-cell currents (Figure 2I). Furthermore, we recorded slowly decaying NMDA-evoked current in 67% (n = 6) of hiN cells (Figure 2J). Moreover, a high percentage of hiN cells displayed presynaptic properties of excitatory glutamatergic neurons, as indicated by positive VGLUT1 staining (44%, n = 50) (Figures 2K and 2L), a marker for the vesicular glutamate transporter. While we observed rare hiN cells of dopaminergic-like phenotype, as evidenced by tyrosine hydroxylase staining (Figures 2M and 2N), none stained for peripherin, choline acetyltransferase, or serotonin (data not shown). By day 30 postinfection, patch-clamp recordings revealed miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), indicative of functional synapses, in 25% (n = 8) of hiN cells (Figure 2O, top panel). These currents were sensitive to NBQX, an AMPA-type glutamate receptor antagonist, but not bicuculline, a competitive inhibitor of GABAA receptors (Figure 2O, bottom panel), thus further confirming their excitatory nature. These results further substantiate the functional neurotransmitter properties of hiN cells derived from postnatal human fibroblasts, and collectively provide strong evidence that the cells had become functional neurons that generated synaptic connections. Finally, to examine whether adult human fibroblasts could generate hiN cells, we tested dermal fibroblasts derived from abdominal skin of a 55-year-old Caucasian female (aHDF-1) and breast skin of a 41-year-old Caucasian female (aHDF-2). After confirming that these cells were free of contaminating neural or spinal progenitor cells, neurons, or epidermal keratinocytes (Figures S1A and S1B), we transduced them with viruses carrying the miBM transgenes. Similar to our observations on postnatal fibroblasts, these adult human fibroblasts were converted to hiN cells with an efficiency of 1.5%–2.9% (aHDF-1) or 9.5%–11.2% (aHDF-2) (Figure S1Q), and displayed characteristic mature neuronal morphology and marker gene expression (Figures 2P–2R). When tested on day 25 postinfection, hiN cells derived from adult fibroblasts also exhibited rapidly inactivating Na+ currents (47%, n = 17) and fired action potentials (12%, n = 25) (Figures 2S and 2T). The mean action potential amplitude was 73.4 ± 18.3 mV (mean ± SEM). Values for resting membrane potential, membrane capacitance, access resistance, and total membrane resistance (Table S2B) were comparable to those of BJ or CRL2097-derived hiN cells, except that the greater membrane resistance probably reflected their more immature nature. Moreover, many of these cells exhibited VGLUT1 immunoreactivity (28%, n = 50) (Figure 2U) and NMDA-evoked responses (60%, n = 5) (Figure 2V), thus displaying excitatory neuronal properties. Additionally, when plated at high density, but not low density, aHDF-hiN cells displayed excitatory synaptic currents (43%, n = 7) (Figure 2W), reflecting functional contacts with neighboring hiNs. Therefore, we have demonstrated here that a combination of miR-124, BRN2, and MYT1L can induce rapid reprogramming of postnatal and adult human fibroblasts into functional neurons. While other combinations of transcription factors have recently been reported to produce neuronal-like cells from human fibroblasts (Pang et al., 2011Pang Z.P. Yang N. Vierbuchen T. Ostermeier A. Fuentes D.R. Yang T.Q. Citri A. Sebastiano V. Marro S. Südhof T.C. Wernig M. Induction of human neuronal cells by defined transcription factors.Nature. 2011; Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) and dopaminergic neurons (Pfisterer et al., 2011Pfisterer U. Kirkeby A. Torper O. Wood J. Nelander J. Dufour A. Björklund A. Lindvall O. Jakobsson J. Parmar M. Direct conversion of human fibroblasts to dopaminergic neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Roncaglia P. Colciago G. et al.Direct generation of functional dopaminergic neurons from mouse and human fibroblasts.Nature. 2011; Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar), an important development with our combined microRNA/transcription factor approach is that we have been able to produce neurons with mature functional synapses between adult fibroblast-derived hiNs in the absence of other cell types. Along these lines, in our study reprogramming was ineffective for combinations of factors lacking miR-124. miR-124, the most abundant microRNA in the mammalian CNS (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002Lagos-Quintana M.

Biol. 2002; 12: 735-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar), is markedly upregulated in differentiating and mature neurons (Deo et al., 2006Deo M. Yu J.Y. Chung K.H.

MicroRNA-mediated switching of chromatin-remodelling complexes in neural development.Nature. 2009; 460: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Moreover, miR-124 targets more than 1000 genes, many of which are downregulated during neuronal differentiation (Lewis et al., 2005Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Conserved seed pairing, often flanked by adenosines, indicates that thousands of human genes are microRNA targets.Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9835) Google Scholar). Interestingly, introduction of miR-124 to HeLa cells could transform their gene expression pattern to resemble that of brain tissue (Lim et al., 2005Lim L.P. Lau N.C. Garrett-Engele P. Grimson A. Schelter J.M. Castle J. Bartel D.P. Linsley P.S. Johnson J.M. Microarray analysis shows that some microRNAs downregulate large numbers of target mRNAs.Nature. 2005; 433: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (3995) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of miR-124 by itself seems to be insufficient to induce neurogenesis, but rather ensured that nonneuronal genes were posttranscriptionally inhibited in neurons (Cao et al., 2007Cao X. Pfaff S.L. Gage F.H. A functional study of miR-124 in the developing neural tube.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In line with these observations, in our experiments miR-124 only effected neuronal reprogramming in the presence of other key factors. The reprogramming platform described here provides rapid conversion of adult cell types directly into neurons, as opposed to more time-consuming and labor-intensive iPSC or ESC-based methods. Our findings also provide a technology that can use patient-specific cells for the rapid production of models of various human neurodegenerative “diseases in a dish,” including diseases that are only manifest later in life.

https://openalex.org/W1992011929,"Mussel adhesion is mediated by foot proteins (mfps) rich in a catecholic amino acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa), capable of forming strong bidentate interactions with a variety of surfaces. A tendency toward facile auto-oxidation, however, often renders dopa unreliable for adhesion. We demonstrate that mussels limit dopa oxidation during adhesive plaque formation by imposing an acidic, reducing regime based on the thiol-rich mfp-6, which restores dopa by coupling the oxidation of thiols to dopaquinone reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2056785199,"FlAsH fluorescence and thioflavin-to-FlAsH FRET are used to distinguish amyloid-β oligomer formation from fibril formation, supporting rapid oligomer formation prior to fibril formation—consistent with a nucleated conformational conversion mechanism—that can be modulated by certain Alzheimer's disease–linked mutations or lipids. Amyloid-β amyloidogenesis is reported to occur via a nucleated polymerization mechanism. If this is true, the energetically unfavorable oligomeric nucleus should be very hard to detect. However, many laboratories have detected early nonfibrillar amyloid-β oligomers without observing amyloid fibrils, suggesting that a mechanistic revision may be needed. Here we introduce Cys-Cys-amyloid-β1–40, which cannot bind to the latent fluorophore FlAsH as a monomer, but can bind FlAsH as an nonfibrillar oligomer or as a fibril, rendering the conjugates fluorescent. Through FlAsH monitoring of Cys-Cys-amyloid-β1–40 aggregation, we found that amyloid-β1–40 rapidly and efficiently forms spherical oligomers in vitro (85% yield) that are kinetically competent to slowly convert to amyloid fibrils by a nucleated conformational conversion mechanism. This methodology was used to show that plasmalogen ethanolamine vesicles eliminate the proteotoxicity-associated oligomerization phase of amyloid-β amyloidogenesis while allowing fibril formation, rationalizing how low concentrations of plasmalogen ethanolamine in the brain are epidemiologically linked to Alzheimer's disease."

Through a genome-wide association study and a replication study consisting of a total of 7,171 individuals with adult asthma (cases) and 27,912 controls in the Japanese population, we identified five loci associated with susceptibility to adult asthma. In addition to the major histocompatibility complex and TSLP-WDR36 loci previously reported, we identified three additional loci: a USP38-GAB1 locus on chromosome 4q31 (combined P = 1.87 × 10(-12)), a locus on chromosome 10p14 (P = 1.79 × 10(-15)) and a gene-rich region on chromosome 12q13 (P = 2.33 × 10(-13)). We observed the most significant association with adult asthma at rs404860 in the major histocompatiblity complex region (P = 4.07 × 10(-23)), which is close to rs2070600, a SNP previously reported for association with FEV(1)/FVC in genome-wide association studies for lung function. Our findings offer a better understanding of the genetic contribution to asthma susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2148856565,"Fork-head transcription factors are required for the maintenance of somatic stem cells. FOXO1 is now found to directly control the expression of pluripotency regulators in human embryonic stem cells, with a FOXO1 orthologue performing a similar function in mouse embryonic stem cells. Pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is defined by their ability to differentiate into three germ layers and derivative cell types1,2,3 and is established by an interactive network of proteins including OCT4 (also known as POU5F1; ref. 4), NANOG (refs 5, 6), SOX2 (ref. 7) and their binding partners. The forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors are evolutionarily conserved regulators of longevity and stress response whose function is inhibited by AKT protein kinase. FoxO proteins are required for the maintenance of somatic and cancer stem cells8,9,10,11,12,13; however, their function in ESCs is unknown. We show that FOXO1 is essential for the maintenance of human ESC pluripotency, and that an orthologue of FOXO1 (Foxo1) exerts a similar function in mouse ESCs. This function is probably mediated through direct control by FOXO1 of OCT4 and SOX2 gene expression through occupation and activation of their respective promoters. Finally, AKT is not the predominant regulator of FOXO1 in human ESCs. Together these results indicate that FOXO1 is a component of the circuitry of human ESC pluripotency. These findings have critical implications for stem cell biology, development, longevity and reprogramming, with potentially important ramifications for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2048549637,"Neural circuits are shaped by experience during periods of heightened brain plasticity in early postnatal life. Exposure to acoustic features produces age-dependent changes through largely unresolved cellular mechanisms and sites of origin. We isolated the refinement of auditory thalamocortical connectivity by in vivo recordings and day-by-day voltage-sensitive dye imaging in an acute brain slice preparation. Passive tone-rearing modified response strength and topography in mouse primary auditory cortex (A1) during a brief, 3-d window, but did not alter tonotopic maps in the thalamus. Gene-targeted deletion of a forebrain-specific cell-adhesion molecule (Icam5) accelerated plasticity in this critical period. Consistent with its normal role of slowing spinogenesis, loss of Icam5 induced precocious stubby spine maturation on pyramidal cell dendrites in neocortical layer 4 (L4), identifying a primary locus of change for the tonotopic plasticity. The evolving postnatal connectivity between thalamus and cortex in the days following hearing onset may therefore determine a critical period for auditory processing."
https://openalex.org/W2051299739,"PICT1 (also known as GLTSCR2) is considered a tumor suppressor because it stabilizes phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), but individuals with oligodendrogliomas lacking chromosome 19q13, where PICT1 is located, have better prognoses than other oligodendroglioma patients. To clarify the function of PICT1, we generated Pict1-deficient mice and embryonic stem (ES) cells. Pict1 is a nucleolar protein essential for embryogenesis and ES cell survival. Even without DNA damage, Pict1 loss led to p53-dependent arrest of cell cycle phase G(1) and apoptosis. Pict1-deficient cells accumulated p53, owing to impaired Mdm2 function. Pict1 binds Rpl11, and Rpl11 is released from nucleoli in the absence of Pict1. In Pict1-deficient cells, increased binding of Rpl11 to Mdm2 blocks Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53. In human cancer, individuals whose tumors express less PICT1 have better prognoses. When PICT1 is depleted in tumor cells with intact P53 signaling, the cells grow more slowly and accumulate P53. Thus, PICT1 is a potent regulator of the MDM2-P53 pathway and promotes tumor progression by retaining RPL11 in the nucleolus."
https://openalex.org/W2145109396,"Notch, a molecule widely known for its role in development and cancer, regulates hepatic glucose metabolism by offsetting excessive glucose production. Given that a series of Notch antagonists are in clinical trials against cancer, they could also be useful against type 2 diabetes. Transcription factor FoxO1 promotes hepatic glucose production. Genetic inhibition of FoxO1 function prevents diabetes in experimental animal models, providing impetus to identify pharmacological approaches to modulate this function. Altered Notch signaling is evident in tumorigenesis, and Notch antagonists are in clinical testing for application in cancer. Here we report that FoxO1 and Notch coordinately regulate hepatic glucose metabolism. Combined haploinsufficiency of FoxO1 and Notch1 markedly raises insulin sensitivity in diet-induced insulin resistance, as does liver-specific knockout of the Notch transcriptional effector Rbp-Jκ. Conversely, Notch1 gain-of-function promotes insulin resistance in a FoxO1-dependent manner and induces glucose-6-phosphatase expression. Pharmacological blockade of Notch signaling with γ-secretase inhibitors raises insulin sensitivity after in vivo administration in lean mice and in obese, insulin-resistant mice. The data identify a heretofore unknown metabolic function of Notch and suggest that Notch inhibition is beneficial in diabetes treatment, in part by helping to offset excessive FoxO1-driven hepatic glucose production."
https://openalex.org/W2051639780,"Although thousands of new neurons are generated during adult life, only a few survive, and the dying neurons are removed by phagocytosis. Ravichadran and colleagues find that in mice a specific class of neuronal progenitor cells expressing doublecortin is responsible for a significant proportion of the phagocytic activity within the neurogenic zones, through activation of the ELMO1–Rac pathway. Disruption of this process impairs neurogenesis. Whereas thousands of new neurons are generated daily during adult life, only a fraction of them survive and become part of neural circuits; the rest die, and their corpses are presumably cleared by resident phagocytes. How the dying neurons are removed and how such clearance influences neurogenesis are not well understood. Here, we identify an unexpected phagocytic role for the doublecortin (DCX)-positive neuronal progenitor cells during adult neurogenesis. Our in vivo andex vivo studies demonstrate that DCX+ cells comprise a significant phagocytic population within the neurogenic zones. Intracellular engulfment protein ELMO1, which promotes Rac activation downstream of phagocytic receptors, was required for phagocytosis by DCX+ cells. Disruption of engulfment in vivo genetically (in Elmo1-null mice) or pharmacologically (in wild-type mice) led to reduced uptake by DCX+ cells, accumulation of apoptotic nuclei in the neurogenic niches and impaired neurogenesis. Collectively, these findings indicate a paradigm wherein DCX+ neuronal precursors also serve as phagocytes, and that their phagocytic activity critically contributes to neurogenesis in the adult brain."

https://openalex.org/W2018384320,"We determined the impact of three factors on mortality in HIV-infected patients who had been on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least one year: (1) insufficient response to (HAART) and presence of AIDS-defining diseases, (2) comorbidity, and (3) drug and alcohol abuse and compared the mortality to that of the general population.In a Danish nationwide, population-based cohort study, we used population based registries to identify (1) all Danish HIV-infected patients who started HAART in the period 1 January 1998-1 July 2009, and (2) a comparison cohort of individuals matched on date of birth and gender (N = 2,267 and 9,068, respectively). Study inclusion began 1 year after start of HAART. Patients were categorised hierarchically in four groups according to the three risk factors, which were identified before study inclusion. The main outcome measure was probability of survival from age 25 to 65 years. The probability of survival from age 25 to age 65 was substantially lower in HIV patients [0.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.55)] compared to the comparison cohort [0.88 (0.86 to 0.90)]. However, in HIV patients with no risk factors (N = 871) the probability of survival was equivalent to that of the general population [0.86 (95% CI 0.77-0.92)]. In contrast, the probability of survival was 0.58 in patients with HIV risk factors (N = 704), 0.30 in patients with comorbidities (N = 479), and 0.03 in patients with drug or alcohol abuse (N = 313).The increased risk of death in HIV-infected individuals is mainly attributable to risk factors that can be identified prior to or in the initial period of antiretroviral treatment. Mortality in patients without risk factors on a successful HAART is almost identical to that of the non-HIV-infected population."
https://openalex.org/W2038701138,"Cellular regulation is believed to evolve in response to environmental variability. However, this has been difficult to test directly. Here, we show that a gene regulation system evolves to the optimal regulatory response when challenged with variable environments. We engineered a genetic module subject to regulation by the lac repressor (LacI) in E. coli, whose expression is beneficial in one environmental condition and detrimental in another. Measured tradeoffs in fitness between environments predict the competition between regulatory phenotypes. We show that regulatory evolution in adverse environments is delayed at specific boundaries in the phenotype space of the regulatory LacI protein. Once this constraint is relieved by mutation, adaptation proceeds toward the optimum, yielding LacI with an altered allosteric mechanism that enables an opposite response to its regulatory ligand IPTG.

Phenotype fitness landscape for lac regulation in variable environments Maladapted lac response evolves to the predicted optimal response Genetic constraints impact the trajectory, and selection determines the outcome Inversion of the allosteric lac response mechanism underlies the evolved state The capability to regulate behavior and physiological state in response to the environment is a fundamental property of all living systems. How novel regulatory phenotypes emerge and adapt in populations challenged by the conflicting demands of variable environments has long fascinated biologists (Agrawal, 2001Agrawal A.A. Phenotypic plasticity in the interactions and evolution of species.Science. 2001; 294: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, Pigliucci, 2001Pigliucci M.

Phenotypic Plasticity: Functional and Conceptual Approaches. Oxford University Press, Oxford2004Google Scholar). The general prediction from theory is that regulatory responses are favored to evolve when the selective environment fluctuates more slowly than the typical timescale of responses (Scheiner, 1993Scheiner S.M. Genetics and Evolution of Phenotypic Plasticity.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 1993; 24: 35-68Crossref Scopus (1231) Google Scholar, Pigliucci, 2001Pigliucci M. Phenotypic Plasticity: Beyond Nature and Nurture. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore2001Google Scholar). However, the outcome of evolution in variable environments may depend on various unknown factors, such as constraints of physical, biochemical, and genetic origin (Maynard Smith et al., 1985Maynard Smith J. Burian R. Kauffman S. Alberch P. Campbell J. Goodwin B. Lande R. Raup D. Wolpert L. Developmental constraints and evolution: A perspective from the Mountain Lake conference on development and evolution.Q. Rev.

Generalists, Specialists, and the Evolution of Phenotypic Plasticity in Sympatric Populations of Distinct Species.Evolution. 1997; 51: 1372-1380Crossref Google Scholar); and the precise strength and direction of selection on regulation (Scheiner, 1993Scheiner S.M.

Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore2001Google Scholar). Therefore, even though experiments have shown that regulation can be beneficial (Pigliucci, 2001Pigliucci M. Phenotypic Plasticity: Beyond Nature and Nurture. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore2001Google Scholar) and can be altered by phenotypic screening (Scheiner, 1993Scheiner S.M. Genetics and Evolution of Phenotypic Plasticity.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 1993; 24: 35-68Crossref Scopus (1231) Google Scholar), most experimental work on the evolution of regulation by mutation and natural selection has remained indecisive and difficult to explain in terms of the causal selective forces and constraint (Scheiner, 2002Scheiner S.M. Selection experiments and the study of phenotypic plasticity.J. Evol. Biol. 2002; 15: 889-898Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Conceptually, addressing this issue is straightforward. Selection at the phenotypic level can be revealed by quantifying the dependence of fitness on the relevant phenotypic parameters (Lunzer et al., 2005Lunzer M. Miller S.P. Felsheim R. Dean A.M. The biochemical architecture of an ancient adaptive landscape.Science. 2005; 310: 499-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, Weinreich et al., 2006Weinreich D.M. Delaney N.F.

Weinreich D.M. Tans S.J. Empirical fitness landscapes reveal accessible evolutionary paths.Nature. 2007; 445: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Constraints may be identified by experimental evolution: an evolutionary response according to selection indicates adaptation, whereas conversely, a lack of such a response points to a constraint (Miller et al., 2006Miller S.P. Lunzer M. Dean A.M. Direct demonstration of an adaptive constraint.Science. 2006; 314: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In practice, however, it is nontrivial to determine the relation between regulation and fitness. The overall growth rates of two known Escherichia coli regulatory mutants have been measured in a variable environment (Suiter et al., 2003Suiter A.M. Bänziger O. Dean A.M. Fitness consequences of a regulatory polymorphism in a seasonal environment.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 12782-12786Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but our limited insight into the genetic basis of regulatory changes hampers extending this approach to systematically assay the full range of possible regulatory responses. To overcome these obstacles, we have developed a synthetic approach. Synthetic systems (Benner and Sismour, 2005Benner S.A. Sismour A.M. Synthetic biology.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) can be engineered to contain the two core elements of regulatory evolution: a cellular phenotype that confers a benefit in one environment and a burden in another and a regulation system that senses the environment and modulates the phenotype. By designing a sensed environmental cue that can be varied separately from the environmental factor that confers the burden or benefit, one can quantify the relation between expression regulation and fitness, prior to adaptation and without the need for a comprehensive library of regulatory mutants. Using this approach, we present a case study of optimality in evolution in variable environments throughout the various levels of biological organization, from the environment down to molecular mechanisms and genotype. To quantify the selective forces and evolutionary change of regulation in variable environments, we constructed an experimental system in Escherichia coli consisting of two genetic modules (Figures 1A and 1B ). The first module comprises an operon that harbors the sacB and cmR genes, which affect the growth rate, as well as the lacZα gene, which is used to quantify the operon expression level E. E is controlled by the lac repressor, LacI, which constitutes the regulatory module. The system as constructed (termed WT hereafter) responds to increasing concentrations of the environmental cue isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) by increasing E. In media containing sucrose, expression of the operon by induction with IPTG leads to a reduced growth rate (Figure 1C and Figure S1 available online), as determined by monitoring the optical density of growing populations. Before inoculation in the sucrose media, the cells were grown without sucrose but with the IPTG concentration of interest in order to achieve the steady-state expression levels. The observed negative effect on growth rate is due to the sucrose-polymerizing activity of levansucrase encoded by sacB, which leads to the accumulation of large polysaccharide chains that interfere with cell wall formation (Gay et al., 1985Gay P. Le Coq D. Steinmetz M. Berkelman T. Kado C.I. Positive selection procedure for entrapment of insertion sequence elements in gram-negative bacteria.J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 918-921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the highest levels of operon expression, we observed negative growth rates. The corresponding decrease in the number of viable cells was quantified using competition and plating assays (Extended Experimental Procedures). We note that the cells lack the genes to metabolize sucrose and use it as a carbon and energy source. Thus, sucrose-containing media confer a selective pressure to decrease operon expression. For media that contain the antibiotic chloramphenicol (Cm), the growth rate is suppressed at low operon expression levels (Figure 1D and Figure S1). When operon expression is increased by induction, the growth rate is progressively restored. This beneficial effect of operon expression is due to the inactivation of the antibiotic by the CmR gene product. Cm media thus confer a selective pressure to increase expression. Increasing the Cm or sucrose concentrations predominantly shifts the point of half-maximum growth along the expression axis and does not significantly affect the maximum growth rate. We find that the growth expression data in sucrose and in Cm media are well-described by the functions Fsucrose(E) and FCm(E), which are based on a simple model of the underlying reaction kinetics (Extended Experimental Procedures). Environments that vary in time between sucrose and Cm result in fluctuating demands on operon expression. The simplest phenotype is one that exhibits a single fixed expression level in both the sucrose and the Cm environment (Figure 2A ). Variable environments confront such unregulated phenotypes with a tradeoff: high fitness in sucrose media—resulting from low operon expression levels—will be at the expense of low fitness in Cm media. Conversely, high fitness in Cm media—due to high expression levels—will entail low fitness in sucrose media. To gain insight into the optimization of the total fitness of fixed expression phenotypes in sucrose-Cm variable environments, we plotted Fsucrose(E) versus FCm(E) for a range of E (Figure 2B). We find that, for the lower Cm and sucrose concentrations, this so-called tradeoff curve (Figure 2B, red line) is concave and bulges outward toward optimal growth in both environments (Figure 2B, cross), whereas for the high concentrations, it is convex and bulges inward away from optimal growth (Figure 2B, blue line). Shapes of tradeoff curves and their consequences for selection have been extensively analyzed on a theoretical level. As pointed out by Levins, who originally introduced the idea in the 1960s (Levins, 1968Levins R. Evolution in Changing Environments. Princeton University Press, Princeton1968Crossref Google Scholar), concave tradeoff curves favor intermediate expression phenotypes that do averagely well in both environments, whereas convex tradeoff curves favor extreme expression phenotypes that perform well just in one environment (Figure 2C). In our study, these contrasting cases depend on the Cm and sucrose concentrations that may be viewed as the amplitude of the environmental variations. The observed change in convexity is a direct consequence of the nonlinear biochemical processes that underlie growth and may well be a general feature of fitness tradeoffs in biological systems. Regulated phenotypes, which can sense changes in the environment and respond by adjusting their expression, can escape from tradeoff curves for unregulated phenotypes (Figure 2B) and acquire higher fitness. When Cm is supplemented with the cue IPTG (1 mM; see Figure 3A ), the WT phenotype in fact exhibits a nearly optimal response: with IPTG, the high expression level E1 is favorable in Cm, whereas without IPTG, the resulting low expression level E0 is favorable in sucrose. As observed in the previous section, however, the best unregulated phenotypes perform almost as well for the lower Cm and sucrose concentrations due to the concave tradeoff curve (Figure 2B, red line). The resulting limited advantage of regulation is not caused by weak selection in each medium separately, as evidenced by the large growth rate differences (Figures 1C and 1D, red curves) but, rather, by the precise shape of the growth expression curves Fsucrose(E) and FCm(E). For higher sucrose and Cm concentrations though, the tradeoff curve becomes convex (Figure 2B, blue curve), thus lowering the maximally attainable fitness for unregulated phenotypes and consequently increasing the selective advantage of regulated phenotypes. To compare the performance of different phenotypes systematically, we consider their overall growth rate in variable environments as a function of E0, the expression level in the environment without IPTG (and with sucrose), and P = E1/E0, the fold change in expression when switching to the environment with 1 mM IPTG (and with Cm). The separate growth rates in the sucrose and Cm media are then found by substituting the value for E0 in the function Fsucrose(E) and E1 in FCm(E) (Figures 1C and 1D). We determine the overall growth rate, Ftot, as the arithmetic mean of the separate growth rates weighted by the fraction of time spent in each environment. We use the arithmetic mean (as opposed to the geometric mean) of the local growth rates because growth rates—unlike the number of offspring—are Malthusian fitness parameters (Roff, 2001Roff D.A. Life History Evolution. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). In Figure 3B, we plot Ftot as a function of E0 and P for the high sucrose and Cm concentrations. This fitness function contains a single optimum near WT (low E0 and high P). The peak is well separated from P = 1, consistent with the strong selection for regulated over nonregulated phenotypes. Having determined the relation between expression phenotype and fitness (Figure 3B), the question is whether it accurately captures the competition between different regulatory mutants in variable environments. We tested this in two ways. First, we competed lacI mutants one to one. We employed lacI mutants that were generated using error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and displayed contrasting expression phenotypes (Figure 3B, crosses). The different alleles were cloned into our plasmid, and pairs of them were grown in sucrose and Cm environments, either with or without IPTG, whereas their relative abundance was followed by plating. Again, cells were grown nonselectively before and after selection, and care was taken that growth was not limited by other growth factors such as carbon or oxygen. These competition results were compared to fitness differences predicted by the fitness function Ftot(E0,P), based on the uninduced (E0) and induced (E1) expression levels of each mutant, which showed a good agreement (Figure 3C). Second, we investigated the competition within a large population of cells with randomly mutated regulatory systems. For this purpose, we again mutated the lacI coding sequence with error-prone PCR. Sequencing indicated an average mutation rate of ∼3 × 10−3 per base pair. The mutated lacI coding regions were placed back into the original plasmid, resulting in a diverse population of ∼106 variants. Note that only the regulatory system was genetically diversified. The rest of the plasmid, including the selection genes, as well as the chromosomal background, remained identical. To characterize the phenotypic diversity prior to selection, 35 clones were randomly picked from the population and mapped in phenotype space based on their measured E0 and P values. The phenotypes did not appear distributed equally throughout the E0-P plane but were, rather, located toward higher E0 and lower P down to P = 1 (Figure 3B), consistent with the expectation that most random mutations in the repressor will deteriorate the ability to repress. The original WT phenotype was not present in this sample of 35 variants. We then exposed the population of ∼106 random variants to a variable-purifying selection. In short, the cells were first grown in the sucrose medium (0.4% w/v) for 6 hr. From the end population, 1/500th was taken and then grown nonselectively at 1 mM IPTG for 3 hr to induce the cells. Next, Cm was added (at 80 μg/ml), and the population continued to grow for another 6 hr. Experiments indicated that the 3 hr of nonselective growth was sufficient to reach steady-state expression and did not significantly influence the overall fitness (Figure S1C). From the final population, we again took isolates randomly, assayed their E0 and E1 values, and mapped them onto the E0-P plane. The group of isolates was clustered at the WT phenotype (Figure 3B). These results indicate that the simple fitness function Ftot(E0,P) captures the competition between diverse regulatory variants, which involves the integration of the different fitness gains and losses experienced by the competing variants as they experience the environmental changes, into an overall total fitness. They also confirm that that the expression E is the key phenotypic parameter in determining fitness in our system. In order to study adaptation to a novel regulatory function, we defined a variable environment in which the WT phenotype is maladapted and can improve by changing the regulatory response. We exploit the decoupling in the system, which allows one to impose a controlled mismatch between cue and selective agent. Here, a medium with sucrose plus IPTG (1 mM) alternates with a medium with Cm (Figure 4A ). In the presence of sucrose and IPTG, the high induced operon expression is burdensome, whereas in Cm media without IPTG, a high operon expression would be beneficial but is repressed. Mirroring the case of the unregulated phenotypes, changing expression overall (in both E0 and E1) gives rise to a tradeoff: an increase in expression leads to gains in Cm but losses in sucrose, whereas conversely, a decrease in expression yields gains in sucrose but losses in Cm. Improvements in both environments may be realized by changes in the regulatory response, namely when IPTG would lead to repression, and an absence of IPTG to expression. Such an inverse regulatory response is, in fact, observed for the LacI homolog PurR, which represses in the presence of the corepressor guanine (Choi and Zalkin, 1992Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Structural characterization and corepressor binding of the Escherichia coli purine repressor.J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6207-6214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that such inversions have occurred in evolutionary history. The fitness function corresponding to this variable environment is displayed in Figures 4B and 4C. E1 and E0 here, respectively, denote the expression level in the medium with sucrose plus IPTG and the medium with Cm. The WT phenotype here maps onto a fitness valley at P > 1, indicating its poor performance in both environments. The peak is located at P < 1, which reflects the inverse nature of the corresponding phenotype (E1 < E0). Next, we monitored evolution of the WT system using the same directed evolution approach. In brief, we prepared randomly mutated lacI variants and then grew a starting population of ∼106 cells in a sucrose medium (0.4% w/v) with IPTG (1 mM) for 6 hr. From the end population, 1/500th was taken and grown nonselectively without IPTG for 3 hr. Then Cm was added (to reach 80 μg/ml), and the population was grown for an additional 6 hr. After selection, a random sample of 35 isolates was mapped within the E0-P plane, which showed that the population mean had shifted toward higher fitness as expected (Figures 4B and 4C, blue spheres). However, no isolates were found below P = 1, suggesting that there exists an adaptive constraint that renders crossing of the P = 1 boundary a rare or impossible event. Note that P < 1 phenotypes might be present in the population at low numbers and absent in the isolates due to insufficient sampling. However, the fitness function does indicate strong selection for P < 1 phenotypes: the growth rate of the optimal phenotypes is more than 1.4 dbl/hr higher than the best isolates at P = 1, making their initial presence very unlikely (p < 0.02, given the relative enrichment factor of 2(1.4·12) ∼1.1 × 105). Selection also affected the shape of the phenotypic distribution, which was now spread out broadly along the E0 axis (P = 1) and had become narrow along the P axis (Figures 4B and 4C). The expansion along E0 can be understood from the constraint: with paths to P < 1 poorly accessible, the paths offering higher fitness lead along the E0 axis toward high or low expression values (Figure 4B, black line). These fixed expression phenotypes may represent evolutionary dead ends, as they can be achieved by simply abolishing repressor-operator binding or IPTG binding capabilities. To test whether P < 1 phenotypes could still emerge before the population was taken over by evolutionary dead ends, we performed a new cycle: 1/500th of the previous culture was taken, and the plasmid DNA was extracted; lacI was randomly mutated as before and placed back into fresh plasmids and hosts, which were subsequently grown in the same sucrose-Cm variable environment. The resulting isolates indicated that, whereas about half of the population remained at P = 1, the other half emerged below (Figures 4B and 4C, gray spheres), showing that P = 1 constituted not a global but a local (breakable) constraint. These results indicate a capacity of the system to evolve a fundamentally altered response to inducer before getting trapped in specialization. The evolved inverse phenotypes were distributed along a downward diagonal, indicating that they all had similar E1 and differed mainly in E0. After a third cycle of the same lacI mutagenesis and variable selection, the mean fitness of the population had further increased, first of all through decreased frequencies of fixed expression (P = 1) phenotypes, which were no longer observed among the isolates (Figures 4B and 4C, red spheres). In addition, the subpopulation of inverse phenotypes showed further fine-tuned improvements of the response toward smaller E0 and smaller P. Figures 5A and 5B show induction profiles of evolved inverse phenotypes. The isolates were now distributed near the effective fitness optimum, which is taken as the average of the maximum observed growth rates in the two environments (1.85 db/hr). Some evolved phenotypes (4 out of 35) had a fitness within 10% of the optimum, which is comparable to the variability that we observed between the predicted fitness and results from competition experiments (Figure 3C). Also note that small fitness increases near an optimum entail long fixation times, given the limited number of isolates that can be assayed. For example, a single mutant with a 10% fitness improvement over the rest of the population (of 106 cells) would require more than 80 hr of growth to be detected in the sampled isolates, as the required enrichment factor is about 104 (which is equal to 2(0.1·1.85·80)). In conclusion, we find no evidence for global constraint in E0 or P, nor a rigid correlation between the two, that prevents access to the landscape optimum. Tracking evolution within phenotype fitness landscapes can identify local adaptive constraints but does not reveal the genetic architecture from which they originate. We sequenced several inverse lacI alleles to provide some insight into the genetic causes of the observed constraint at P = 1 (Table S1). S97P appeared to be a key substitution: it occurred in the majority of genotypes and was essential for achieving the optimal inverse response. In a WT background, however, S97P yielded a P = 1 phenotype, as was determined by constructing this mutant using site-directed mutagenesis, and as was also corroborated by previous studies (Suckow et al., 1996Suckow J. Markiewicz P. Kleina L.G. Miller J. Kisters-Woike B. Müller-Hill B. Genetic studies of the Lac repressor.

Allosteric transition pathways in the lactose repressor protein core domains: asymmetric motions in a homodimer.Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2523-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this serine residue, which is located at the dimer interface of the repressor, is central to the IPTG-induced allosteric transition in LacI (Flynn et al., 2003Flynn T.C. Swint-Kruse L. Kong Y. Booth C. Matthews K.S. Ma J.

Positions 94-98 of the lactose repressor N-subdomain monomer-monomer interface are critical for allosteric communication.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 8636-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This may explain the observed interference with induction by the S97P mutation. Unlike the recurring S97P substitution, other genetic changes found in the inverse lacI alleles were diverse. For instance, one inverse phenotype harbored the mutations S69Y, Q131P, M242I, and a stop at L346 in addition to S97P, whereas another contained K108N, E235D, and Q352E together with S97P (Table S1). Though we could not identify a specific pattern or known functional effect for these additional mutations, their diversity indicated the presence of different possible mutational routes from S97P and P = 1 to the optimum inverse phenotype. In order to study the functional relevance of the observed mutations and their interactions, we engineered lacI variants containing subsets of the mutations found in one evolved inverse phenotype (M-inv-5; see Table S1). We found that, out of the six nonsynonymous mutations, three (S97P, R207L, and T258A) were sufficient in a WT background to confer an inverse phenotype (P ∼0.02). Next, we engineered the double mutants S97P-R207L and S97P-T258A, which both gave a value for P of order 1, as did the single mutant S97P. Thus, in the S97P background, R207L and T258A individually were nearly neutral but together conferred inversion, which indicates epistasis between R207L and T258A. R207L also exhibited epistasis with S97P; in the T258A background that displayed a WT phenotype (P of order 10), R207L was again neutral, but in the S97P-T258A background, R207L transformed a P = 1 phenotype into the inverted phenotype. Overall, the results suggest that S97P is a rare and unique gateway at P = 1 from WT at P > 1 to the optimum at P < 1 and support the notion that the phenotypic clustering at P = 1 was due to genetic constraint. Next, we questioned what molecular mechanism could underlie the regulatory change. One might imagine that the transcription factor now activates rather than represses by binding elsewhere in the regulatory region. However, no mutations were found in the DNA recognition domain of LacI, which would be required for this scenario. The inversion could also be explained by a mechanism in which the nonspecific affinity to DNA is increased, as has been shown previously for LacI inversion (Pfahl, 1976Pfahl M. lac Repressor-operator interaction. Analysis of the X86 repressor mutant.J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 106: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, Miller and Schmeissner, 1979Miller J.H. Schmeissner U. Genetic studies of the lac repressor. X. Analysis of missense mutations in the lacI gene.J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 223-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An increased overall affinity then leads to binding to other cellular DNA, titrating transcription factor away from the operator and thus producing expression without IPTG. In this scenario, the allosteric effect of IPTG on LacI actually remains the same as fo"
https://openalex.org/W2097712502,"The physiological and pathophysiological implications of the expression of vimentin, a type III intermediate filament protein, in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) are unknown. We provide data demonstrating that vimentin is regulated by TGFβ1, a major cytokine released in response to acute lung injury and that vimentin is required for wound repair and remodeling of the alveolar epithelium. Quantitative real-time PCR shows a 16-fold induction of vimentin mRNA in TGFp1-treated transformed AECs. Luciferase assays identify a Smad-binding element in the 5' promoter of vimentin responsible for TGFβ1-induced transcription. Notably, TGFβ1 induces vimentin protein expression in AECs, which is associated with a 2.5-fold increase in cell motility, resulting in increased rates of migration and wound closure. These effects are independent of cell proliferation. TGFβ1-mediated vimentin protein expression, cell migration, and wound closure are prevented by a pharmacological inhibitor of the Smad pathway and by expression of Ad-shRNA against vimentin. Conversely, overexpression of mEmerald-vimentin is sufficient for increased cell-migration and wound-closure rates. These results demonstrate that vimentin is required and sufficient for increased wound repair in an in vitro model of lung injury.—Rogel, M. R., Soni, P. N., Troken, J. R., Sitikov, A., Trejo, H.

https://openalex.org/W1966197218,"Over the past decade, investigators have attempted to establish the pathophysiological mechanisms by which non-penetrating injuries damage the brain. Several studies have implicated either membrane poration or ion channel dysfunction pursuant to neuronal cell death as the primary mechanism of injury. We hypothesized that traumatic stimulation of integrins may be an important etiological contributor to mild Traumatic Brain Injury. In order to study the effects of forces at the cellular level, we utilized two hierarchical, in vitro systems to mimic traumatic injury to rat cortical neurons: a high velocity stretcher and a magnetic tweezer system. In one system, we controlled focal adhesion formation in neurons cultured on a stretchable substrate loaded with an abrupt, one dimensional strain. With the second system, we used magnetic tweezers to directly simulate the abrupt injury forces endured by a focal adhesion on the neurite. Both systems revealed variations in the rate and nature of neuronal injury as a function of focal adhesion density and direct integrin stimulation without membrane poration. Pharmacological inhibition of calpains did not mitigate the injury yet the inhibition of Rho-kinase immediately after injury reduced axonal injury. These data suggest that integrin-mediated activation of Rho may be a contributor to the diffuse axonal injury reported in mild Traumatic Brain Injury."
https://openalex.org/W1976797314,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) is a gene expressed in the nervous system that encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase commonly known for its oncogenic function in various human cancers. We have determined that Alk is associated with altered behavioral responses to ethanol in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, in mice, and in humans. Mutant flies containing transposon insertions in dAlk demonstrate increased resistance to the sedating effect of ethanol. Database analyses revealed that Alk expression levels in the brains of recombinant inbred mice are negatively correlated with ethanol-induced ataxia and ethanol consumption. We therefore tested Alk gene knockout mice and found that they sedate longer in response to high doses of ethanol and consume more ethanol than wild-type mice. Finally, sequencing of human ALK led to the discovery of four polymorphisms associated with a low level of response to ethanol, an intermediate phenotype that is predictive of future alcohol use disorders (AUDs). These results suggest that Alk plays an evolutionary conserved role in ethanol-related behaviors. Moreover, ALK may be a novel candidate gene conferring risk for AUDs as well as a potential target for pharmacological intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1992392338,"Background Treatment with tenofovir is sometimes associated with renal dysfunction. Limited information is available on this side effect in patients with small body weight, although the use of tenofovir will spread rapidly in Asia and Africa, where patients are likely to be of smaller body weight. Methods In a single-center cohort, Japanese patients with HIV infection who started tenofovir-containing antiretroviral therapy were retrospectively analyzed. The incidence of tenofovir-associated renal dysfunction, defined as more than 25% decrement of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from the baseline, was determined. The effects of small body weight and body mass index (BMI) on tenofovir-associated renal dysfunction, respectively, were estimated in univariate and multivariate Cox hazards models as the primary exposure. Other possible risk factors were evaluated by univariate analysis and those found significant were entered into the multivariate analysis. Results The median weight of 495 patients was 63 kg. Tenofovir-related renal dysfunction occurred in 97 (19.6%) patients (incidence: 10.5 per 100 person-years). Univariate analysis showed that the incidence of tenofovir-related renal dysfunction was significantly associated with smaller body weight and BMI, respectively (per 5 kg decrement, HR = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.10–1.37; p<0.001)(per 1 kg/m2 decrement, HR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.05–1.23; p = 0.001). Old age, high baseline eGFR, low serum creatinine, low CD4 count, high HIV viral load, concurrent nephrotoxic drugs, hepatitis C infection, and current smoking were also associated with tenofovir-related renal dysfunction. Multivariate analysis identified small body weight as a significant risk (adjusted HR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01–1.27; p = 0.039), while small BMI had marginal significance (adjusted HR = 1.07; 95% CI 1.00–1.16; p = 0.058). Conclusion The incidence of tenofovir-associated renal dysfunction in Japanese patients was high. Small body weight was identified as an independent risk factor for tenofovir-associated renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function is advocated for patients with small body weight treated with tenofovir."
https://openalex.org/W2020765082,"Background Chronic lung diseases are the third leading cause of death in the United States due in part to an incomplete understanding of pathways that govern the progressive tissue remodeling that occurs in these disorders. Adenosine is elevated in the lungs of animal models and humans with chronic lung disease where it promotes air-space destruction and fibrosis. Adenosine signaling increases the production of the pro-fibrotic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that IL-6 signaling contributes to tissue destruction and remodeling in a model of chronic lung disease where adenosine levels are elevated. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested this hypothesis by neutralizing or genetically removing IL-6 in adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient mice that develop adenosine dependent pulmonary inflammation and remodeling. Results demonstrated that both pharmacologic blockade and genetic removal of IL-6 attenuated pulmonary inflammation, remodeling and fibrosis in this model. The pursuit of mechanisms involved revealed adenosine and IL-6 dependent activation of STAT-3 in airway epithelial cells. Conclusions/Significance These findings demonstrate that adenosine enhances IL-6 signaling pathways to promote aspects of chronic lung disease. This suggests that blocking IL-6 signaling during chronic stages of disease may provide benefit in halting remodeling processes such as fibrosis and air-space destruction."

https://openalex.org/W2029286913,"Neuroimaging studies in late life depression have reported decreased structural integrity of white matter tracts in the prefrontal cortex. Functional studies have identified changes in functional connectivity among several key areas involved in mood regulation. Few studies have combined structural and functional imaging. In this study we sought to examine the relationship between the uncinate fasciculus, a key fronto-temporal tract and resting state functional connectivity between the ventral prefrontal cortex ((PFC) and limbic and striatal areas.The sample consisted of 24 older patients remitted from unipolar major depression. Each participant had a magnetic resonance imaging brain scan using standardized protocols to obtain both diffusion tensor imaging and resting state functional connectivity data. Our statistical approach compared structural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus and functional connectivity data.We found positive correlations between left uncinate fasciculus (UF) fractional anisotropy (FA) and resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the left ventrolateral PFC and left amygdala and between the left ventrolateral PFC and the left hippocampus. In addition, we found a significant negative correlation between left ventromedial PFC-caudate rsFC and left UF FA. The right UF FA did not correlate with any of the seed region based connectivity.These results support the notion that resting state functional connectivity reflects structural integrity, since the ventral PFC is structurally connected to temporal regions by the UF. Future studies should include larger samples of patients and healthy comparison subjects in which both resting state and task-based functional connectivity are examined."
https://openalex.org/W1977527516,"Phosphorylation of heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20) by protein kinase A (PKA) is now recognized as an important regulatory mechanism modulating contractile activity in the human myometrium. Thus agonists that stimulate cyclic AMP production may cause relaxation with resultant beneficial effects on pathologies that affect this tissue such as the onset of premature contractions prior to term. Here we describe for the first time that acetylation of Hsp20 is also a potent post-translational modification that can affect human myometrial activity. We show that histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) is a non-nuclear lysine deacetylase (KDAC) that can interact with Hsp20 to affect its acetylation. Importantly, use of a selective linkerless hydroxamic acid HDAC8 inhibitor increases Hsp20 acetylation with no elevation of nuclear-resident histone acetylation nor marked global gene expression changes. These effects are associated with significant inhibition of spontaneous and oxytocin-augmented contractions of ex vivo human myometrial tissue strips. A potential molecular mechanism by which Hsp20 acetylation can affect myometrial activity by liberating cofilin is described and further high-lights the use of specific effectors of KDACs as therapeutic agents in regulating contractility in this smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1990517556,"Background Transgenic mice with low levels of global insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) throughout their life span, including pre- and postnatal development, have increased longevity. This study investigated whether specific deficiency of liver-derived, endocrine IGF-I is of importance for life span. Methods and Findings Serum IGF-I was reduced by approximately 80% in mice with adult, liver-specific IGF-I inactivation (LI-IGF-I-/- mice), and body weight decreased due to reduced body fat. The mean life span of LI-IGF-I-/- mice (n = 84) increased 10% vs. control mice (n = 137) (Cox's test, p<0.01), mainly due to increased life span (16%) of female mice [LI-IGF-I-/- mice (n = 31): 26.7±1.1 vs. control (n = 67): 23.0±0.7 months, p<0.001]. Male LI-IGF-I-/- mice showed only a tendency for increased longevity (p = 0.10). Energy expenditure, measured as oxygen consumption during and after submaximal exercise, was increased in the LI-IGF-I-/- mice. Moreover, microarray and RT-PCR analyses showed consistent regulation of three genes (heat shock protein 1A and 1B and connective tissue growth factor) in several body organs in the LI-IGF-I-/- mice. Conclusions Adult inactivation of liver-derived, endocrine IGF-I resulted in moderately increased mean life span. Body weight and body fat decreased in LI-IGF-I-/- mice, possibly due to increased energy expenditure during exercise. Genes earlier reported to modulate stress response and collagen aging showed consistent regulation, providing mechanisms that could underlie the increased mean life span in the LI-IGF-I-/- mice."
https://openalex.org/W2134052560,"We provide novel functional data that posttranscriptional silencing of gene RPL19 using RNAi not only abrogates the malignant phenotype of PC-3M prostate cancer cells but is selective with respect to transcription and translation of other genes. Reducing RPL19 transcription modulates a subset of genes, evidenced by gene expression array analysis and Western blotting, but does not compromise cell proliferation or apoptosis in-vitro. However, growth of xenografted tumors containing the knocked-down RPL19 in-vivo is significantly reduced. Analysis of the modulated genes reveals induction of the non-malignant phenotype principally to involve perturbation of networks of transcription factors and cellular adhesion genes. The data provide evidence that extra-ribosomal regulatory functions of RPL19, beyond protein synthesis, are critical regulators of cellular phenotype. Targeting key members of affected networks identified by gene expression analysis raises the possibility of therapeutically stabilizing a benign phenotype generated by modulating the expression of an individual gene and thereafter constraining a malignant phenotype while leaving non-malignant tissues unaffected."
https://openalex.org/W2013142360,"Background Bacterial sRNAs are a class of small regulatory RNAs involved in regulation of expression of a variety of genes. Most sRNAs act in trans via base-pairing with target mRNAs, leading to repression or activation of translation or mRNA degradation. To date, more than 1,000 sRNAs have been identified. However, direct targets have been identified for only approximately 50 of these sRNAs. Computational predictions can provide candidates for target validation, thereby increasing the speed of sRNA target identification. Although several methods have been developed, target prediction for bacterial sRNAs remains challenging. Results Here, we propose a novel method for sRNA target prediction, termed sTarPicker, which was based on a two-step model for hybridization between an sRNA and an mRNA target. This method first selects stable duplexes after screening all possible duplexes between the sRNA and the potential mRNA target. Next, hybridization between the sRNA and the target is extended to span the entire binding site. Finally, quantitative predictions are produced with an ensemble classifier generated using machine-learning methods. In calculations to determine the hybridization energies of seed regions and binding regions, both thermodynamic stability and site accessibility of the sRNAs and targets were considered. Comparisons with the existing methods showed that sTarPicker performed best in both performance of target prediction and accuracy of the predicted binding sites. Conclusions sTarPicker can predict bacterial sRNA targets with higher efficiency and determine the exact locations of the interactions with a higher accuracy than competing programs. sTarPicker is available at http://ccb.bmi.ac.cn/starpicker/."

Some aspects of the quality and reproducibility of UDPS have been previously evaluated, but comprehensive studies are still needed.In this study the UDPS technology (FLX platform) was evaluated by analyzing a 120 base pair fragment of the HIV-1 pol gene from plasma samples from two patients and artificial mixtures of molecular clones. UDPS was performed using an optimized experimental protocol and an in-house data cleaning strategy. Nine samples and mixtures were analyzed and the average number of reads per sample was 19,404 (range 8,858-26,846). The two patient plasma samples were analyzed twice and quantification of viral variants was found to be highly repeatable for variants representing >0.27% of the virus population, whereas some variants representing 0.11-0.27% were detected in only one of the two UDPS runs. Bland-Altman analysis showed that a repeated measurement would have a 95% likelihood to lie approximately within ±0.5 log(10) of the initial estimate. A similar level of agreement was observed for variant frequency estimates in forward vs. reverse sequencing direction, but here the agreement was higher for common variants than for rare variants. UDPS following PCR amplification with alternative primers indicated that some variants may be incorrectly quantified due to primer-related selective amplification. Finally, the in vitro recombination rate during PCR was evaluated using artificial mixtures of clones and was found to be low. The most abundant in vitro recombinant represented 0.25% of all UDPS reads.This study demonstrates that this UDPS protocol results in low experimental noise and high repeatability, which is relevant for future research and clinical use of the UDPS technology. The low rate of in vitro recombination suggests that this UDPS system can be used to study genetic variants and mutational linkage."

Here we showed that in podocytes 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) markedly stimulated nephrin mRNA and protein expression. ChIP scan of the 6-kb 5' upstream region of the mouse nephrin gene identified several putative vitamin D response elements (VDREs), and EMSA confirmed that the VDRE at -312 (a DR4-type VDRE) could be bound by vitamin D receptor (VDR)/retinoid X receptor. Luciferase reporter assays of the proximal nephrin promoter fragment (-427 to +173) showed strong induction of luciferase activity upon 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment, and the induction was abolished by mutations within -312VDRE. ChIP assays showed that, upon 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) activation, VDR bound to this VDRE leading to recruitment of DRIP205 and RNA polymerase II and histone 4 acetylation. Treatment of mice with a vitamin D analog induced nephrin mRNA and protein in the kidney, accompanied by increased VDR binding to the -312VDRE and histone 4 acetylation. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) reversed high glucose-induced nephrin reduction in podocytes, and vitamin D analogs prevented nephrin decline in both type 1 and 2 diabetic mice. Together these data demonstrate that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) stimulates nephrin expression in podocytes by acting on a VDRE in the proximal nephrin promoter. Nephrin up-regulation likely accounts for part of the renoprotective activity of vitamin D."

https://openalex.org/W1988186235,"Background The small molecule Eeyarestatin I (ESI) inhibits the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-cytosol dislocation and subsequent degradation of ERAD (ER associated protein degradation) substrates. Toxins such as ricin and Shiga/Shiga-like toxins (SLTx) are endocytosed and trafficked to the ER. Their catalytic subunits are thought to utilise ERAD-like mechanisms to dislocate from the ER into the cytosol, where a proportion uncouples from the ERAD process, recovers a catalytic conformation and destroys their cellular targets. We therefore investigated ESI as a potential inhibitor of toxin dislocation. Methodology and Principal Findings Using cytotoxicity measurements, we found no role for ESI as an inhibitor of toxin dislocation from the ER, but instead found that for SLTx, ESI treatment of cells was protective by reducing the rate of toxin delivery to the ER. Microscopy of the trafficking of labelled SLTx and its B chain (lacking the toxic A chain) showed a delay in its accumulation at a peri-nuclear location, confirmed to be the Golgi by examination of SLTx B chain metabolically labelled in the trans-Golgi cisternae. The drug also reduced the rate of endosomal trafficking of diphtheria toxin, which enters the cytosol from acidified endosomes, and delayed the Golgi-specific glycan modifications and eventual plasma membrane appearance of tsO45 VSV-G protein, a classical marker for anterograde trafficking. Conclusions and Significance ESI acts on one or more components that function during vesicular transport, whilst at least one retrograde trafficking pathway, that of ricin, remains unperturbed."
https://openalex.org/W2035897845,"GABA (γ-amino-butylic acid)-mediated inhibition in the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons was characterized by two-photon uncaging of a caged-GABA compound, BCMACM-GABA, and one-photon uncaging of RuBi-GABA in rat hippocampal slice preparations. Although we found that GABA(A)-mediated currents were diffusely distributed along the dendrites, currents elicited at the branch points of the apical dendritic trunk were approximately two times larger than those elsewhere in the dendrite. We examined the inhibitory action of the GABA-induced currents on Ca(2+) transients evoked with a single back-propagating action potential (bAP) in oblique dendrites. We found that GABA uncaging selectively inhibited the Ca(2+) transients in the region adjacent (<20 µm) to the uncaging site, and that GABA uncaging was effective only within a short period after bAP (<20 ms). The strength of inhibition was linearly related to the amplitudes of the GABA currents, suggesting that the currents inhibited a sustained, subthreshold after-depolarization without preventing propagation of bAP. GABA uncaging at the dendritic branch points inhibited Ca(2+) transients farther into dendritic branches (>20 µm). Our data indicate that GABA inhibition results in spatially confined inhibition of Ca(2+) transients shortly after bAP, and suggest that this effect is particularly potent at the dendritic branch points where GABA receptors cluster."
https://openalex.org/W1966279539,"Background Auditory feedback has been demonstrated to play an important role in the control of voice fundamental frequency (F0), but the mechanisms underlying the processing of auditory feedback remain poorly understood. It has been well documented that young adults can use auditory feedback to stabilize their voice F0 by making compensatory responses to perturbations they hear in their vocal pitch feedback. However, little is known about the effects of aging on the processing of audio-vocal feedback during vocalization. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we recruited adults who were between 19 and 75 years of age and divided them into five age groups. Using a pitch-shift paradigm, the pitch of their vocal feedback was unexpectedly shifted ±50 or ±100 cents during sustained vocalization of the vowel sound/u/. Compensatory vocal F0 response magnitudes and latencies to pitch feedback perturbations were examined. A significant effect of age was found such that response magnitudes increased with increasing age until maximal values were reached for adults 51–60 years of age and then decreased for adults 61–75 years of age. Adults 51–60 years of age were also more sensitive to the direction and magnitude of the pitch feedback perturbations compared to younger adults. Conclusion These findings demonstrate that the pitch-shift reflex systematically changes across the adult lifespan. Understanding aging-related changes to the role of auditory feedback is critically important for our theoretical understanding of speech production and the clinical applications of that knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W1970213505,"Background Our previous study revealed that administration of syngeneic female BALB/c mice with excessive self activated lymphocyte-derived DNA (ALD-DNA) could induce systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease, indicating that overload of self-DNA might exceed normal clearance ability and comprise the major source of autoantigens in lupus mice. Serum amyloid P component (SAP), an acute-phase serum protein with binding reactivity to DNA in mice, was proved to promote the clearance of free DNA and prevent mice against self-antigen induced autoimmune response. It is reasonable to hypothesize that SAP treatment might contribute to alleviation of SLE disease, whereas its role in ALD-DNA-induced lupus nephritis is not fully understood. Methodology/Principal Findings The ratios of SAP to DNA significantly decreased and were negatively correlated with the titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies in ALD-DNA-induced lupus mice, indicating SAP was relatively insufficient in lupus mice. Herein a pcDNA3-SAP plasmid (pSAP) was genetically constructed and intramuscularly injected into BALB/c mice. It was found that SAP protein purified from the serum of pSAP-treated mice bound efficiently to ALD-DNA and inhibited ALD-DNA-mediated innate immune response in vitro. Treatment of ALD-DNA-induced lupus mice with pSAP in the early stage of SLE disease with the onset of proteinuria reversed lupus nephritis via decreasing anti-dsDNA autoantibody production and immune complex (IC) deposition. Further administration of pSAP in the late stage of SLE disease that had established lupus nephritis alleviated proteinuria and ameliorated lupus nephritis. This therapeutic effect of SAP was not only attributable to the decreased levels of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies, but also associated with the decreased infiltration of lymphocytes and the reduced production of inflammatory markers. Conclusion/Significance These results suggest that SAP administration could effectively alleviated lupus nephritis via modulating anti-dsDNA antibody production and the inflammation followed IC deposition, and SAP-based intervening strategy may provide new approaches for treating SLE disease."
https://openalex.org/W2030676026,"The identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccines that elicit a protective immune response in the lungs is important for the development of an effective vaccine against tuberculosis.In this study, a comparison of intranasal (i.n.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination with the BCG vaccine demonstrated that a single moderate dose delivered intranasally induced a stronger and sustained M. tuberculosis-specific T-cell response in lung parenchyma and cervical lymph nodes of BALB/c mice than vaccine delivered subcutaneously. Both BCG and a multicomponent subunit vaccine composed of nine M. tuberculosis recombinant proteins induced strong antigen-specific T-cell responses in various local and peripheral immune compartments. Among the nine recombinant proteins evaluated, the alanine proline rich antigen (Apa, Rv1860) was highly antigenic following i.n. BCG and immunogenic after vaccination with a combination of the nine recombinant antigens. The Apa-induced responses included induction of both type 1 and type 2 cytokines in the lungs as evaluated by ELISPOT and a multiplexed microsphere-based cytokine immunoassay. Of importance, i.n. subunit vaccination with Apa imparted significant protection in the lungs and spleen of mice against M. tuberculosis challenge. Despite observed differences in the frequencies and location of specific cytokine secreting T cells both BCG vaccination routes afforded comparable levels of protection in our study.Overall, our findings support consideration and further evaluation of an intranasally targeted Apa-based vaccine to prevent tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2150309719,"We investigated the physiological role of Gβ5, a unique G protein β subunit that dimerizes with regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins of the R7 family instead of Gβ. Gβ5 is essential for stability of these complexes, so that its knockout (KO)causes degradation of the entire Gβ5-R7 family. We report that the Gβ5-KO mice remain leaner than the wild type (WT) throughout their lifetime and are resistant to a high-fat diet. They have a 5-fold increase in locomotor activity, increased thermogenesis, and lower serum insulin, all of which correlate with a higher level of secreted epinephrine. Heterozygous (HET) mice are 2-fold more active than WT mice. Surprisingly, with respect to body weight, the HET mice display a phenotype opposite to that of the KO mice: by the age of 6 mo, they are ≥15% heavier than the WT and have increased adiposity, insulin resistance, and liver steatosis. These changes occur in HET mice fed a normal diet and without apparent hyperphagia, mimicking basic characteristics of human metabolic syndrome. We conclude that even a partial reduction in Gβ5-R7 level can perturb normal animal metabolism and behavior. Our data on Gβ5 haploinsufficient mice may explain earlier observations of genetic linkage between R7 family mutations and obesity in humans.—Wang, Q., Levay, K., Chanturiya, T., Dvoriantchikova, G., Anderson, K.

https://openalex.org/W2026727018,"AT1G78690, a gene found in Arabidopsis thaliana, has been reported to encode a N-acyltransferase that transfers an acyl chain from acyl-CoA to the headgroup of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to form N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (N-acyl-PE). Our investigation suggests that At1g78690p is not a PE-dependent N-acyltransferase but is instead a lysoglycerophospholipid O-acyltransferase. We overexpressed AT1G78690 in Escherichia coli, extracted the cellular lipids, and identified the accumulating glycerophospholipid as acylphosphatidylglycerol (acyl-PG). Electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis yielded [M − H]− ions, corresponding by exact mass to acyl-PG rather than N-acyl-PE. Collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry (MS/MS) yielded product ions consistent with acyl-PG. In addition, in vitro enzyme assays using both 32P- and 14C-radiolabeled substrates showed that AT1G78690 acylates 1-acyllysophosphatidylethanolamine (1-acyllyso-PE) and 1-acyllysophosphatidylglycerol (1-acyllyso-PG), but not PE or phosphatidylglycerol (PG), to form a diacylated product that co-migrates with PE and PG, respectively. We analyzed the diacylated product formed by AT1G78690 using a combination of base hydrolysis, phospholipase D treatment, ESI-MS, and MS/MS to show that AT1G78690 acylates the sn-2-position of 1-acyllyso-PE and 1-acyllyso-PG.

In animals, N-acyl-PE synthesis is catalyzed by two distinct biochemical activities. A Ca2+-dependent membrane-associated protein has been characterized in brain, testis, and heart (14Schmid H.H. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This enzyme has been shown to catalyze the transfer of an acyl chain from the sn-1-position of a diacylated GPL, functions most efficiently at alkaline pH, and requires divalent cations (13Ueda N.

The gene encoding this enzyme has yet to be identified. A lecithin retinol acyltransferase-like protein from rats, RLP-1, has been shown to encode a Ca2+-independent N-acyltransferase (NAT) (17Jin X.H. Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3614-3623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is predominantly expressed in testis and is, therefore, thought to be distinct from the Ca2+-dependent NAT. Ca2+-independent NAT activity is detected in both the soluble and membrane fractions when overexpressed in COS-7 cells and does not show preference for transfer of the sn-1 or sn-2 acyl chain to the amine of PE (17Jin X.H.

In plants, N-acyl-PE is proposed to be synthesized from PE and unesterified fatty acids by a membrane-bound N-acyl-PE synthase (3Chapman K.D. Moore Jr., T.S.

Recently, Faure et al. (20Faure L. Coulon D. Laroche-Traineau J. Le Guedard M. Schmitter J.M. Testet E. Lessire R. Bessoule J.J. J. Biol.

They reported that overexpression of AT1G78690 in E. coli led to the accumulation of N-acyl-PE in cells and the presence of acyl-CoA-dependent N-acyl-PE synthase activity in membranes. AT1G78690 has homology to lysoglycerophospholipid (lyso-GPL) acyltransferases such as the lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase Slc1 from A. thaliana and the lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase YPR140wp from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (20Faure L.

Multiple attempts to detect N-acyl-PE synthase activity from cell-free extracts prepared from E. coli induced to overexpress AT1G78690 were unsuccessful. Therefore, we reinvestigated the biochemical activity of AT1G78690 in E. coli. In this work, we show that this enzyme is a lyso-GPL acyltransferase and that its overexpression in E. coli leads to the accumulation of acylphosphatidylglycerol (acyl-PG), not N-acyl-PE.

Single colonies were restreaked on LB-amp and grown at 37 °C overnight. Overnight cultures were inoculated from a single colony into liquid LB-amp containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, grown shaking at 225 rpm at 37 °C overnight, and then diluted into LB-amp medium to an A600 of 0.01. The culture was grown at 37 °C, shaking at 225 rpm until the A600 was about 0.4–0.5. Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and cells were cultured an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 2600 × g and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4) when cells were used for lipid extraction or with 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, when cells were used for preparation of protein extracts. Cell pellets were frozen at −80 °C until further use. The final cell pellet from a 50-ml growth of E. coli was resuspended in 0.8 ml of PBS and transferred to a disposable glass centrifuge tube equipped with Teflon-lined lids. The cellular lipids were extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar), as described previously (24Garrett T.A. Raetz C.R. Richardson T. Kordestani R. Son J.D. Rose R.L. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 1589-1599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of CHCl3 and 2 ml of CH3OH were added to the cell suspension to generate a single phase extraction mixture of CHCl3/CH3OH/PBS (1:2:0.8, v/v/v). After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 2600 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and converted to a two-phase Bligh-Dyer extraction mixture (CHCl3/CH3OH/PBS, 2:2:1.8, v/v/v) by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform and 1 ml of PBS. The extraction mixture was centrifuged as above to resolve the phases. The upper phase was removed, and the lower phase was washed with 2 ml of pre-equilibrated neutral upper phase. The resulting two-phase extraction mixture was centrifuged as described above. The upper phase was discarded, and the resulting lower phase was dried under N2 gas. Dried lipid films were stored at −20 °C. Two solvent systems were used to display lipids on silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates. Solvent system A was CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (65:25:4, v/v/v) and was used to display mono-, di-, and triacylated lipids. Solvent system B was C6H12/CH3CH2OCH2CH3/(CH3)2CO:CH3COOH (50:40:10:1, v/v/v/v) and was used to distinguish monoacylglycerol from N-acylethanolamine (9Chapman K.D. Moore Jr., T.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Lipids were visualized by exposure to iodine vapors, by charring with 10% H2SO4 in CH3CH2OH, or by phosphorimaging using a Bio-Rad Personal Molecular Imager. Total lipid extracts were redissolved in CHCl3/CH3OH, (2:1, v/v) and spotted continuously along the bottom of a 10 × 10-cm HPTLC plate. The plate was developed in solvent A, and lipids were visualized by exposure to iodine vapors. The region of the TLC plate containing the lipid of interest was wetted with water, and the silica chips were scraped from the plate and placed in a glass centrifuge tube. 2 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v) were added to the chips, and the silica chips were dispersed using a bath sonicator (Laboratory Supplies Co., Hicksville, NY). The dispersed silica chips were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min in a clinical centrifuge. The supernatant was filtered through glass wool and transferred to a glass tube. The pelleted silica chips were re-extracted two additional times to maximize yield of the lipid of interest. All three supernatants were combined and dried under N2. Dried lipid films were stored at −20 °C. S. chromofuscus phospholipase D was used following the methods of Imamura and Horiuti (25Imamura S. Horiuti Y. J. Biochem. 1978; 83: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Each reaction contained 0.08 units/μl S. chromofuscus phospholipase D resuspended in 0.05% BSA and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mg/ml Triton X-100 detergent, and 12.5 μg/μl lipid substrate. Reactions were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C and terminated by plating onto a TLC plate. The dried lipid film was redissolved in 100 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v) to a concentration of ∼5 mg/ml. This solution was directly infused into the turbo electrospray ionization source of a QSTAR XL quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (ABI/MDS-Sciex, Toronto, Canada) at 6 μl/min. Mass spectra were obtained scanning from 200 to 2000 Da in negative ion mode with the electrospray ionization source operating at the following settings: nebulizer gas, 21 kilopascals; curtain gas, 27 kilopascals; ion spray voltage, −4500 V; declustering potential, −55 V; focusing potential, −265 V; declustering potential 2, −15 V. The instrument was calibrated using polypropylene glycol (Applied Biosystems). Under normal operating conditions, the resolution of the instrument was 10,000–15,000. The mass accuracy of the instrument was between 5 and 20 ppm, and therefore measured masses are given to three decimal places. Collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was performed with a collision energy of −50.0 V (laboratory frame of reference) and N2 as the collision gas. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using the Analyst QS 1.1 software. Exact masses of lipid species and product ions were obtained using CS Chem Draw Pro, version 11.0. A culture of BLR(DE3)pLysS/pET15b and BLR(DE3)pLysS/pAt1g78690p was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB-amp. This overnight was used to start a 10-ml culture in LB-amp containing 100 μCi of [32P]PO4. This culture, as well as an unlabeled culture for monitoring growth, was incubated at 37 °C. When the A600 reached 0.4–0.5, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mm IPTG. The culture was grown for 3 h, and cells were harvested, extracted, and dried as described above. In vivo labeled lipids from BLR(DE3)pLysS/pET15b and BLR(DE3)pLysS/pAt1g78690p (1000 dpm) were redissolved in CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v), treated with NaOH (final concentration 0.2 m), and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The reaction was spotted to TLC with an equivalent amount of untreated samples, developed in solvent system A, and phosphorimaged as described above. E. coli BLR(DE3)pLysS/pET15b and BLR(DE3)pLysS/pAt1g78690p were grown and induced as described above. The cell pellet from a 50-ml culture was resuspended in 2 ml of 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and cells were lysed in a French pressure cell at 18,000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 2600 × g to pellet unlysed cells. The resulting cell-free extract was transferred to a fresh tube and stored at −80 °C. Washed membranes were prepared by centrifuging the cell-free extract at 4 °C, 100,000 × g for 1 h. The membrane pellet was resuspended by homogenization in 2 ml of 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and centrifuged again as described above. The final washed membrane pellet was resuspended by homogenization in 2.0 ml of 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4. For membrane solubilization, Triton X-100, Tris-HCl, and double-distilled H2O were added to washed membranes to yield a final concentration of 1% Triton X-100, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 1 mg/ml protein. The samples were incubated on ice with periodic inversion for 30 min and then spun at 100,000 × g, 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube to yield solubilized membranes. The concentration of all protein samples was determined using the bicinchoninic acid reagent (Thermo Scientific) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. All protein samples were stored at −80 °C. E. coli MG1655 cells were cultured as described above. A 10-ml culture was inoculated to A600 of 0.01, and 1 mCi of [32P]PO43− was added to the culture. Cells were grown to an A600 of ∼1.0 and harvested by centrifugation for 15 min in a clinical centrifuge. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 0.4 ml of PBS and extracted as described above. All extraction volumes were adjusted to maintain the proper Bligh-Dyer extraction mixture ratios (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). The total lipid extract, which contains primarily [32P]PE and [32P]PG, was spotted along the bottom of a 20 × 20-cm TLC plate and developed in solvent A. [32P]PE and [32P]PG were identified by phosphorimaging. The silica chips were scraped and extracted as described above. The dried lipid films were resuspended by sonication in 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, for use in aqueous reactions. Following this procedure, the [32P]PE and [32P]PG were ∼95% pure as evaluated by PhosphorImager analysis. 1-Acyllyso-[32P]PG and 1-acyllyso-[32P]PE were generated enzymatically using porcine pancreas phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (26Janssen M.J. van de Wiel W.A. Beiboer S.H. van Kampen M.D. Verheij H.M. Slotboom A.J. Egmond M.R. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (100 μl) containing [32P]PE or [32P]PG, 15 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml of PLA2 was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was converted to an acidic two-phase Bligh Dyer by the addition of 3 μl of 6 n HCl, 200 μl of CHCl3, and 200 μl of CH3OH (final proportions of CHCl3, CH3OH, and 0.1 n HCl were 2:2:1.8 (v/v/v)). The phases were resolved by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 1 min. The lower phase was removed to a fresh tube, and the upper phase was washed two times with 300 μl of pre-equilibrated acidic lower phase. The lower phases were combined and dried under N2. The dried lipids were stored at −20 °C. 32P-GPLs or lyso-32P-GPLs were tested as substrates for the AT1G78690 enzyme. Reactions contained 100 μm acyl acceptor (GPL or lyso-GPL), ∼1000 cpm/μl 32P-GPL or lyso-32P-GPL, 100 μm palmitoyl-CoA, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.001–1 mg/ml protein. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated, and the reaction was stopped by spotting a 5-μl portion onto a silica gel 60 TLC plate. TLC plates were developed in solvent A and imaged using a PhosphorImager. Reactions were also carried out with [14C]palmitoyl-CoA (60.0 mCi/mmol) as the labeled substrate. Reactions contained 100 μm acceptor GPL, 100 μm palmitoyl-CoA, ∼2000 dpm/μl [14C]palmitoyl-CoA, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.001–1 mg/ml protein. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated, and the reaction was stopped by spotting a 5-μl portion onto a TLC plate. TLC plates were developed in solvent A and imaged using a PhosphorImager. In vitro products were generated in a 2-ml reaction that contained 117 μm arachidonyl-CoA, 2 mm 1-oleoyllyso-PE or 1-oleoyllyso-PG, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.46 mg/ml solubilized membranes from BLR(DE3)pLysS/pET15b or BLR(DE3)pLysS/pAt1g78690p. The reaction was incubated for 160 min at 37 °C and terminated by Bligh-Dyer extraction as described above. The lower phase was dried under N2 gas and stored at −20 °C until further analysis. The products of the in vitro reaction were resuspended in 100 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v) and analyzed using a normal phase liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer. The normal phase chromatography was performed using a Zorbax Rx-SIL (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) column on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system as described previously (24Garrett T.A. Raetz C.R. Richardson T. Kordestani R. Son J.D. Rose R.L. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 1589-1599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The HPLC effluent (0.5 ml/min) was analyzed using an Agilent 6520 quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Samples were ionized by electrospray ionization in the negative or positive mode as indicated. Mass spectra were obtained scanning from 100 to 2000 at 1 spectrum/s with the following instrument parameters: fragmentor voltage, 175 V; drying gas temperature, 325 °C; drying gas flow, 11 liters/min; nebulizer pressure, 45 p.s.i.g.; capillary voltage, 4000 V. Data were collected with the instrument set to 3200 mass range under high resolution conditions at a 4-GHz data acquisition rate. Data were collected in profile mode. For MS/MS analysis, spectra were obtained scanning from 100 to 2000 at 1 spectrum/s with an isolation width of ∼4 m/z. The collision energy was −40.0 V (laboratory frame of reference), and N2 was the collision gas. The instrument was calibrated using Agilent ESI-L low concentration tuning mix, and under normal operating conditions the resolution of the instrument was ∼15,000. The mass accuracy of the instrument was between 1 and 5 ppm, and therefore measured masses are given to three decimal places. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Agilent MassHunter Work station Acquisition software and Agilent MassHunter Workstation Qualitative Analysis software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), respectively. BLR(DE3)pLysS/pET and BLR(DE3)pLysS/pAt1g78690p were grown and induced with IPTG to express proteins under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter (27Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted and displayed on HPTLC plates (Fig. 1). A prominent band with an Rf higher than the major diacylated lipids, PE and PG, accumulated in cells induced to express AT1G78690 as compared with the lipid extract from the uninduced and vector control cells. This result is consistent with a previous report from Faure et al. (20Faure L. Coulon D. Laroche-Traineau J. Le Guedard M. Schmitter J.M. Testet E. Lessire R. Bessoule J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18734-18741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), from which they concluded that this accumulating lipid was N-acyl-PE. As shown in Fig. 1 (lanes 2 and 3), the accumulating lipid nearly co-migrated with an authentic N-acyl-PE standard but also with an authentic acyl-PG standard (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). Negative ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was performed on the total lipid extracts from BLR(DE3)pLysS/pET15b and BLR(DE3)pLysS/pAt1g78690p (Fig. 2, A and B). The predominant ions between m/z 650 and 800 represent doubly charged species [M − 2H]2− of cardiolipin and singly charged species [M − H]− of PE and PG by exact mass and MS/MS analysis (24Garrett T.A.

In the 900–1200 atomic mass units range, the negative ions at m/z 915.702, 943.736, 953.743, 955.757, 971.768, 983.769, 985.771, 995.769, 997.780, 1011.780, 1013.799, 1023.786, and 1025.787 are enriched in total lipid extracts from cells overexpressing AT1G78690. These ions correspond by exact mass and MS/MS to acyl-PG (see Table 1). The accumulating lipid was purified from lipid extracts of BLR(DE3)pLysS/pAt1g78690p by prep-TLC and analyzed by negative ion ESI-MS (Fig. 2C). The predominant [M − H]− ions in the 870–1060 atomic mass units range correspond by exact mass to the m/z expected for acyl-PGs with acyl chains shown in Table 1. MS/MS verified that these ions corresponded to acyl-PG. Fig. 2D shows the results for the ion at m/z 983.5. The product ions are consistent with a GPL, as indicated by the product ion at m/z 152.996 that corresponds to C3H6O5P− (29Pulfer M. Murphy R.C. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2003; 22: 332-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 31Hsu F.F. Turk J. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed.

Mass Spectrom. 2004; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Acyl chains corresponding to palmitate (16:0, m/z 255.233) and 12-methylene-palmitoleate (17cp, m/z 267.234) are also seen (33Wang A.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The product ion at m/z 733.501 corresponds to the loss of one of the 17cp acyl chains. The ions at m/z 391.225 and 403.228 correspond to the loss of the acylated headgroup and the 17cp acyl chain or the 16:0 acyl chain as a fatty acid (RCO2H), respectively. The MS/MS spectrum of a synthetic 54:3 (total number of carbons in the acyl chains/total number of unsaturations) acyl-PG standard yields analogous product ions (supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, the exact masses of the major [M − H]− ions do not match the exact mass predicted for N-acyl-PE molecular species, nor are the product ions observed consistent with those of N-acyl-PE (4Mileykovskaya E.

https://openalex.org/W2113916248,"Cellular DExD/H-box RNA-helicases perform essential functions during mRNA biogenesis. The closely related human proteins UAP56 and URH49 are members of this protein family and play an essential role for cellular mRNA export by recruiting the adaptor protein REF to spliced and unspliced mRNAs. In order to gain insight into their mode of action, we aimed to characterize these RNA-helicases in more detail. Here, we demonstrate that UAP56 and URH49 exhibit an intrinsic CRM1-independent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity. Extensive mapping studies identified distinct regions within UAP56 or URH49 required for (i) intranuclear localization (UAP56 aa81-381) and (ii) interaction with REF (UAP56 aa51-428). Moreover, the region conferring nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity was mapped to the C-terminus of UAP56, comprising the amino acids 195-428. Interestingly, this region coincides with a domain within Uap56p of S. pombe that has been reported to be required for both Rae1p-interaction and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. However, in contrast to this finding we report that human UAP56 shuttles independently from Rae1. In summary, our results reveal nucleocytoplasmic shuttling as a conserved feature of yeast and human UAP56, while their export receptor seems to have diverged during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1967958729,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B cell neoplasm characterized by bone marrow infiltration with malignant plasma cells. IGF-1 signalling has been explored as a therapeutic target in this disease. We analyzed the effect of the IKK2 inhibitor AS602868, in combination with a monoclonal antibody targeting IGF-1 receptor (anti-IGF-1R) in human MM cell lines. We found that anti-IGF-1R potentiated the apoptotic effect of AS602868 in LP1 and RPMI8226 MM cell lines which express high levels of IGF-1R. Anti-IGF-1R enhanced the inhibitory effect of AS602868 on NF-κB pathway signalling and potentiated the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential caused by AS602868. These results support the role of IGF-1 signalling in MM and suggest that inhibition of this pathway could sensitize MM cells to NF-κB inhibitors."

IntroductionIn the periphery, the neurotransmitter dopamine modulates blood pressure and blood flow and regulates sodium and water excretion (1McDonald Jr., R.H. Goldberg L.I. McNay J.L. Tuttle Jr., E.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1964; 43: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In the kidney, dopamine is produced locally in the tubular cells (2Hussain T. Lokhandwala M.F. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Dopamine receptors are divided into two broad categories on the basis of their structural and functional properties: the D1-like receptors (D1R and D5R) and the D2-like receptors (D2R, D3R, and D4R) (3Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that regulate dopamine receptor expression in pathophysiological conditions are not well understood. The D1-like receptors link to stimulatory Gs/Golf proteins and activate adenylyl cyclase to increase intracellular cAMP. In contrast, the D2-like receptors are coupled to inhibitory Gi/Go proteins and decrease cAMP levels (3Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). The activation of renal D1 dopamine receptors by locally produced dopamine inhibits sodium-potassium-ATPase and sodium-hydrogen exchanger promoting renal sodium excretion (4Aperia A.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 621-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Thus, pathological conditions that decrease expression or function of D1 receptors in the kidney will increase sodium retention, potentially leading to the development of hypertension. Indeed, mice lacking functional D1 receptors develop hypertension (5Albrecht F.E. Drago J. Felder R.A. Printz M.P. Eisner G.M. Robillard J.E. Sibley D.R. Westphal H.J. Jose P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2283-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Several studies have also shown a defect in D1 receptor function in hypertension (2Hussain T. Lokhandwala M.F. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).Previous studies have shown that in both type I and type II diabetes, renal D1 receptor gene expression is reduced >50%, resulting in increased sodium retention (6Marwaha A. Banday A.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F451-F457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Hussain T. Beheray S.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that down-regulate renal D1 receptor gene expression in diabetes are not well understood. We have previously shown that expression of D1 receptors in the Cath A-derived catecholaminergic mouse neuronal cell line is down-regulated by the extracellular cAMP-adenosine (ECA) 2The abbreviations used are: ECAextracellular cAMP-adenosineAMP-CPα,β-methyleneadenosine 5′-diphosphate5′-Ecto-NT5′-ectonucleotidaseSNKStudent-Newman-KeulsSTZstreptozotocinTNAPtissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. signaling pathway (8Do T. Sun Q. Beuve A. Kuzhikandathil E.V. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because the ECA signaling pathway proteins are highly expressed in the kidney (9Jackson E.K. Dubey R.K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F597-F612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and their expression levels are altered in diabetes, we developed a hypothesis that the down-regulation of renal D1 dopamine receptor expression in diabetes is mediated by the ECA signaling pathway.Secretion of cAMP by mammalian cells in response to stimuli that increase intracellular cAMP was described originally in 1963 by Davoren and Sutherland (10Davoren P.R. Sutherland E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3009-3015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Secretion of cAMP has since been reported in numerous cells and tissues (9Jackson E.K. Dubey R.K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F597-F612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Efflux of cAMP has also been reported in vivo in the brain of awake behaving rats (11Stone E.A. John S.M. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1942-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), liver (12Kuster J. Zapf J. Jakob A. FEBS Lett. 1973; 32: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and kidney (13Levy M. Starr N.L. Kidney Int. 1972; 2: 76-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Exton J.H. Robison G.A. Sutherland E.W. Park C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6166-6177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological effects of extracellular cAMP in mammals, in the kidney and other tissues, are primarily mediated by its conversion first to AMP by ectophosphodiesterases and then to adenosine via 5′-ectonucleotidases (5′-Ecto-NT) and/or tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) (9Jackson E.K. Dubey R.K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F597-F612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adenosine is also generated from extracellular ATP by a family of ectonucleotidases (15Latini S. Pedata F. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 463-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 16Matsuoka I. Ohkubo S. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 94: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Adenosine activates G protein-coupled adenosine receptors that stimulate or inhibit, among other effectors, adenylyl cyclase. These proteins together with the ectophosphodiesterases, 5′-Ecto-NT, and TNAP make up the ECA signaling pathway (9Jackson E.K. Dubey R.K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F597-F612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Latini S. Pedata F. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 463-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar).The pancreato-hepato-renal axis primarily provides the extracellular cAMP that activates the renal ECA signaling pathway. Glucagon secreted from the pancreas stimulates adenylyl cyclase in the liver to form cAMP which is released into the hepatic vein (17Broadus A.E. Kaminsky N.I. Northcutt R.C. Hardman J.G. Sutherland E.W. Liddle G.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1970; 49: 2237-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The kidney filters cAMP into the tubular lumen where it is concentrated in the proximal tubule due to the reabsorption of water. The proximal tubule expresses all components of the ECA signaling pathway necessary to form adenosine from the liver-generated cAMP (18Jackson E.K. Raghvendra D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In animals and people with obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia, oral glucose administration instead of inhibiting, stimulates pancreatic glucagon secretion (19Velliquette R.A. Koletsky R.J. Ernsberger P. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2002; 227: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Iannello S. Campione R. Belfiore F. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 63: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The excessive glucagon secreted from the pancreas, under these pathological conditions, increases the cAMP synthesized and secreted from the liver (17Broadus A.E. Kaminsky N.I. Northcutt R.C. Hardman J.G. Sutherland E.W. Liddle G.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1970; 49: 2237-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The chronically elevated extracellular cAMP results in stimulation of abnormally high adenosine production in the renal tubules which contributes to development of hypertension (18Jackson E.K. Raghvendra D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the streptozotocin (STZ)-treated diabetic rats, the extracellular concentration of adenosine is elevated (21Angielski S. Jakubowski Z. Pawelczyk T. Piec G. Redlak M. Contrib. Nephrol. 1989; 73: 52-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and levels of the adenosine-metabolizing enzyme, adenosine kinase, are reduced by 50% (22Pawelczyk T. Sakowicz M. Szczepanska-Konkel M. Angielski S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The plasma and urine levels of cAMP in STZ-treated rats have not been reported previously.To test the hypothesis that the down-regulation of renal D1 dopamine receptor expression in diabetes is mediated by the ECA signaling pathway, we determined the expression of D1 receptors and various components of the ECA pathway both in cAMP-treated primary renal cell culture and in the kidney of STZ-induced diabetic rats. Our results suggest that whereas the renal D1 receptor expression is down-regulated, the expression of key proteins in the ECA pathway is up-regulated both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, inhibitors of Ecto-5′-NT and TNAP blocked the down-regulation of renal D1 receptors both in vitro and in vivo. The results support our hypothesis that the ECA signaling pathway regulates the expression of the renal D1 dopamine receptor.DISCUSSIONThe results support our hypothesis that the ECA pathway down-regulates the expression of D1 dopamine receptor in STZ-induced diabetic rats. The ECA pathway has been described in several organ systems, including, the brain, kidney, cardiac tissue, and ovaries (11Stone E.A. John S.M. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1942-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Jackson E.K. Raghvendra D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 29Dubey R.K.

Reprod. 2003; 69: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated the ability of this signaling pathway to regulate D1 receptor gene expression directly in the Cath A-derived catecholaminergic cell line (8Do T. Sun Q. Beuve A. Kuzhikandathil E.V. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here, we present novel evidence that the expression of renal D1 receptor is regulated by the ECA pathway in vitro and in vivo in a rat model of type I diabetes. Extensive work by several groups has characterized the ECA pathway and its component proteins in the kidney (18Jackson E.K. Raghvendra D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Jackson E.K. Zacharia L.C. Zhang M. Gillespie D.G. Zhu C. Dubey R.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 317: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, a pancreato-hepato-renal cascade has been proposed which links pancreatic release of glucagon and elevated hepatic cAMP release with renal adenosine formation (9Jackson E.K. Dubey R.K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F597-F612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jackson E.K. Raghvendra D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the STZ-treated rats, extracellular concentration of adenosine is elevated (21Angielski S. Jakubowski Z. Pawelczyk T. Piec G. Redlak M. Contrib. Nephrol. 1989; 73: 52-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and levels of the adenosine-metabolizing enzyme, adenosine kinase, are reduced by 50% (36Hendy G.N. Tomlinson S. O'Riordan J.L. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 7: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our results, showing elevated plasma and urine levels of cAMP in STZ-induced diabetic rat (Fig. 4), support these studies and suggest that the pancreato-hepato-renal cascade is hyperactivated in pathological conditions such as diabetes. This is also consistent with the observation that, in animals and people with obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia, oral glucose administration instead of inhibiting, stimulates pancreatic glucagon secretion (19Velliquette R.A. Koletsky R.J. Ernsberger P. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2002; 227: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Iannello S. Campione R. Belfiore F. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 63: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The excessive glucagon secreted from the pancreas, under these pathological conditions, increases the cAMP synthesized and secreted from the liver (17Broadus A.E. Kaminsky N.I. Northcutt R.C. Hardman J.G. Sutherland E.W. Liddle G.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1970; 49: 2237-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Early studies in normal humans showed that administration of glucagon causes large release of cAMP from the liver with plasma levels reaching ∼450 nm (36Hendy G.N. Tomlinson S. O'Riordan J.L. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 7: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 4 show that the steady-state plasma cAMP levels in STZ-induced diabetic rats was ∼40 nm, which corresponds to a 30% increase compared with control animals. In the urine of diabetic rats, the increase in cAMP levels was even higher; there was a ∼250% increase in cAMP levels compared with control rats. As the stability of cAMP is significantly greater than adenosine, the chronically elevated cAMP level in the diabetic rats promotes the sustained activation of the ECA signaling pathway.Previous studies have shown that the renal dopaminergic system plays an important role in modulating sodium level, particularly during increases in dietary sodium intake. The renal D1 dopamine receptor is a key component of this regulatory system, controlling the function of sodium-potassium-ATPase and sodium-hydrogen exchanger. A decrease in the expression or function of D1 dopamine receptor will result in increased sodium retention (6Marwaha A. Banday A.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F451-F457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Hussain T. Beheray S.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which, if chronically elevated, can potentially lead to the development of hypertension. Indeed, studies have shown that in D1 dopamine receptor knock-out mice the systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures are higher (5Albrecht F.E. Drago J. Felder R.A. Printz M.P. Eisner G.M. Robillard J.E. Sibley D.R. Westphal H.J. Jose P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2283-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Several studies have also shown a defect in D1 receptor function in hypertension (2Hussain T. Lokhandwala M.F. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In both type I and type II diabetes, renal D1 dopamine receptor gene expression is reduced >50%, resulting in increased sodium retention (6Marwaha A. Banday A.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F451-F457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Hussain T. Beheray S.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 5 showing a significant reduction in expression of D1 receptor mRNA and protein in the cortex and medulla of kidneys from STZ-treated rats are consistent with these previous studies. The mechanisms that down-regulate D1 dopamine receptor gene expression in diabetes, in the kidney, are not well understood. The results presented here suggest that the ECA pathway is involved in the down-regulation of renal D1 receptor expression in diabetic rats.The key proteins of the ECA pathway are expressed in the kidney. 5′-Ecto-NT (also called CD73) is expressed in the kidney (37Vekaria R.M. Shirley D.G. Sévigny J. Unwin R.J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F550-F560Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and its activity and expression are increased in hypertensive and diabetic-hypertensive patients (38Lunkes G.I. Lunkes D. Stefanello F. Morsch A. Morsch V.M. Mazzanti C.M. Schetinger M.R. Thromb. Res. 2003; 109: 189-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), in platelets of alloxan-induced diabetic rats (39Lunkes G.I. Lunkes D.S. Morsch V.M. Mazzanti C.M. Morsch A.L. Miron V.R. Schetinger M.R. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 2004; 65: 1-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and in adipose tissue of STZ-treated rats and mice (40Jamal Z. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our results suggest differential regulation of 5′-Ecto-NT in the kidney cortex versus medulla of STZ-treated diabetic rats. 5′-Ecto-NT mRNA and protein are down-regulated in the kidney cortex and up-regulated in the kidney medulla (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). TNAP is expressed in the kidney (41Nouwen E.J. De Broe M.E. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1994; 47: S43-S51PubMed Google Scholar, 42Hoshi K. Amizuka N. Oda K. Ikehara Y. Ozawa H. Histochem. Cell. Biol. 1997; 107: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); however, its renal expression level in diabetic animal models was not known. The results in FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7 suggest that TNAP expression in the kidney cortex but not medulla is significantly increased in STZ-treated diabetic rats. The complementary regulation of 5′-Ecto-NT and TNAP in the kidney cortex and medulla of diabetic rats is intriguing and likely determines their individual contribution to regulation of renal D1 receptor by the ECA pathway.In the kidney, adenosine regulates several physiological functions including renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, transport function, and urine flow (43McCoy D.E. Bhattacharya S. Olson B.A. Levier D.G. Arend L.J. Spielman W.S. Semin. Nephrol. 1993; 13: 31-40PubMed Google Scholar). Adenosine activates four known P1 adenosine receptor subtypes that include the A1, A2a, A2b, and A3. The A1 and A3 adenosine receptors exhibit inhibitory coupling to adenylyl cyclase and decrease cAMP levels whereas A2a and A2b receptors couple to adenylyl cyclase via stimulatory G proteins (Gs/Golf) and increase cAMP levels (44Jacobson K.A. Gao Z.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Compared with other tissues and organs, the various adenosine receptor isoforms are expressed at relatively low levels in normal kidneys (45Yaar R. Jones M.R. Chen J.F. Ravid K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 202: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In STZ-treated diabetic rats the expression level of adenosine A1, A2a, and A3 receptors in the kidney is increased (35Pawelczyk T. Grden M. Rzepko R. Sakowicz M. Szutowicz A. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 167: 315-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our current studies did not identify the adenosine receptor subtype involved in the down-regulation of renal D1 receptors in diabetic rats. In this paper, we evaluated A2a adenosine receptors because our previous study in the Cath A-derived cell line showed that down-regulation of D1 dopamine receptors is mediated by A2a and not A1 adenosine receptors (8Do T. Sun Q. Beuve A. Kuzhikandathil E.V. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A previous study has shown that the level of A2a receptors in the diabetic kidney cortex is increased 3-fold (35Pawelczyk T. Grden M. Rzepko R. Sakowicz M. Szutowicz A. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 167: 315-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 6C are consistent with this observation; moreover, the results show that the up-regulation of adenosine A2a receptor in the diabetic rats is reversed by the AMP-CP treatment (Fig. 9C), suggesting that the A2a receptor is also likely to be regulated by the ECA pathway.In summary, we have demonstrated that the down-regulation of renal D1 dopamine receptor expression in STZ-induced diabetic rats is mediated by the ECA pathway. Although the D1 receptor is down-regulated in the kidney cortex and medulla, the mechanism underlying the down-regulation is different in the two kidney regions. The results suggest that the 5′-Ecto-NT or CD73 protein mediates the D1 receptor down-regulation in the medulla whereas the TNAP protein is involved in the down-regulation observed in the cortex. Given the role of the renal dopaminergic system and D1 receptors in maintaining sodium homeostasis and blood pressure, the identification of the ECA pathway as a key regulator of renal D1 receptor expression will help develop novel therapeutic approaches to modulate renal D1 receptor expression. IntroductionIn the periphery, the neurotransmitter dopamine modulates blood pressure and blood flow and regulates sodium and water excretion (1McDonald Jr., R.H. Goldberg L.I. McNay J.L. Tuttle Jr., E.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1964; 43: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In the kidney, dopamine is produced locally in the tubular cells (2Hussain T. Lokhandwala M.F. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Dopamine receptors are divided into two broad categories on the basis of their structural and functional properties: the D1-like receptors (D1R and D5R) and the D2-like receptors (D2R, D3R, and D4R) (3Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that regulate dopamine receptor expression in pathophysiological conditions are not well understood. The D1-like receptors link to stimulatory Gs/Golf proteins and activate adenylyl cyclase to increase intracellular cAMP. In contrast, the D2-like receptors are coupled to inhibitory Gi/Go proteins and decrease cAMP levels (3Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). The activation of renal D1 dopamine receptors by locally produced dopamine inhibits sodium-potassium-ATPase and sodium-hydrogen exchanger promoting renal sodium excretion (4Aperia A.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 621-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Thus, pathological conditions that decrease expression or function of D1 receptors in the kidney will increase sodium retention, potentially leading to the development of hypertension. Indeed, mice lacking functional D1 receptors develop hypertension (5Albrecht F.E. Drago J. Felder R.A. Printz M.P. Eisner G.M. Robillard J.E. Sibley D.R. Westphal H.J. Jose P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2283-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Several studies have also shown a defect in D1 receptor function in hypertension (2Hussain T. Lokhandwala M.F. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).Previous studies have shown that in both type I and type II diabetes, renal D1 receptor gene expression is reduced >50%, resulting in increased sodium retention (6Marwaha A. Banday A.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F451-F457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Hussain T. Beheray S.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that down-regulate renal D1 receptor gene expression in diabetes are not well understood. We have previously shown that expression of D1 receptors in the Cath A-derived catecholaminergic mouse neuronal cell line is down-regulated by the extracellular cAMP-adenosine (ECA) 2The abbreviations used are: ECAextracellular cAMP-adenosineAMP-CPα,β-methyleneadenosine 5′-diphosphate5′-Ecto-NT5′-ectonucleotidaseSNKStudent-Newman-KeulsSTZstreptozotocinTNAPtissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. signaling pathway (8Do T. Sun Q. Beuve A. Kuzhikandathil E.V. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because the ECA signaling pathway proteins are highly expressed in the kidney (9Jackson E.K. Dubey R.K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F597-F612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and their expression levels are altered in diabetes, we developed a hypothesis that the down-regulation of renal D1 dopamine receptor expression in diabetes is mediated by the ECA signaling pathway.Secretion of cAMP by mammalian cells in response to stimuli that increase intracellular cAMP was described originally in 1963 by Davoren and Sutherland (10Davoren P.R. Sutherland E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3009-3015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Secretion of cAMP has since been reported in numerous cells and tissues (9Jackson E.K. Dubey R.K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F597-F612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Efflux of cAMP has also been reported in vivo in the brain of awake behaving rats (11Stone E.A. John S.M. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1942-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), liver (12Kuster J. Zapf J. Jakob A. FEBS Lett. 1973; 32: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and kidney (13Levy M. Starr N.L. Kidney Int. 1972; 2: 76-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Exton J.H. Robison G.A. Sutherland E.W. Park C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6166-6177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological effects of extracellular cAMP in mammals, in the kidney and other tissues, are primarily mediated by its conversion first to AMP by ectophosphodiesterases and then to adenosine via 5′-ectonucleotidases (5′-Ecto-NT) and/or tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) (9Jackson E.K. Dubey R.K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F597-F612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adenosine is also generated from extracellular ATP by a family of ectonucleotidases (15Latini S. Pedata F. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 463-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 16Matsuoka I. Ohkubo S. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 94: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopu"
https://openalex.org/W2128485362,"Background Emerging evidence suggests that vascular disease confers vulnerability to a late-onset of depressive illness and the impairment of specific cognitive functions, most notably in the domains of memory storage and retrieval. Lower limb athero-thrombosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) have both been previously associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms possibly due to associated intracerebral vascular disease or systemic inflammation, hence suggesting that these illnesses may be regarded as models to investigate the vascular genesis of neuropsychiatric symptoms. The aim of this study was to compare neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety and a variety of cognitive domains in patients who had symptoms of peripheral athero-thrombosis (intermittent claudication) and those who had an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm AAA. Methodology/Principal Findings In a cross-sectional study, 26 participants with either intermittent claudication or AAA were assessed using a detailed neuropsychiatric assessment battery for various cognitive domains and depression and anxiety symptoms (Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Scales). Student t test and linear regression analyses were applied to compare neuropsychiatric symptoms between patient groups. AAA participants showed greater levels of cognitive impairment in the domains of immediate and delayed memory as compared to patients who had intermittent claudication. Cognitive dysfunction was best predicted by increasing aortic diameter. CRP was positively related to AAA diameter, but not to cognitive function. AAA and aortic diameter in particular were associated with cognitive dysfunction in this study. Conclusions/Significance AAA patients are at a higher risk for cognitive impairment than intermittent claudication patients. Validation of this finding is required in a larger study, but if confirmed could suggest that systemic factors peculiar to AAA may impact on cognitive function."
https://openalex.org/W2012678416,"During isometric contractions, slow twitch soleus muscles (SOL) from rats with chronic heart failure (chf) are more fatigable than those of sham animals. However, a muscle normally shortens during activity and fatigue development is highly task dependent. Therefore, we examined the development of skeletal muscle fatigue during shortening (isotonic) contractions in chf and sham-operated rats. Six weeks following coronary artery ligation, infarcted animals were classified as failing (chf) if left ventricle end diastolic pressure was >15mmHg. During isoflurane anaesthesia, SOL with intact blood supply was stimulated (1s on 1s off) at 30Hz for 15 min and allowed to shorten isotonically against a constant afterload. Muscle temperature was maintained at 37°C. In resting muscle, maximum isometric force (Fmax) and the concentrations of ATP and CrP were not different in the two groups. During stimulation, Fmax and the concentrations declined in parallel sham and chf. Fatigue, which was evident as reduced shortening during stimulation, was also not different in the two groups. The isometric force decline was fitted to a bi-exponential decay equation. Both time constants increased transiently and returned to initial values after approximately 200 s of the fatigue protocol. This resulted in a transient rise in baseline tension between stimulations, although this effect which was less prominent in chf than sham. Myosin light chain 2s phosphorylation declined in both groups after 100 s of isotonic contractions, and remained at this level throughout 15 min of stimulation. In spite of higher energy demand during isotonic than isometric contractions, both shortening capacity and rate of isometric force decline were as well or better preserved in fatigued SOL from chf rats than in sham. This observation is in striking contrast to previous reports which have employed isometric contractions to induce fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W2164374277,"Transcriptional control of gene regulation is an intricate process that requires precise orchestration of a number of molecular components. Studying its evolution can serve as a useful model for understanding how complex molecular machines evolve. One way to investigate evolution of transcriptional regulation is to test the functions of cis-elements from one species in a distant relative. Previous results suggested that few, if any, tissue-specific promoters from Drosophila are faithfully expressed in C. elegans. Here we show that, in contrast, promoters of fly and human heat-shock genes are upregulated in C. elegans upon exposure to heat. Inducibility under conditions of heat shock may represent a relatively simple ""on-off"" response, whereas complex expression patterns require integration of multiple signals. Our results suggest that simpler aspects of regulatory logic may be retained over longer periods of evolutionary time, while more complex ones may be diverging more rapidly."
