https://openalex.org/W1507638890,"Optoelectronic devices are increasingly important in communication and information technology. To achieve the necessary manipulation of light (which carries information in optoelectronic devices), considerable efforts are directed at the development of photonic crystals--periodic dielectric materials that have so-called photonic bandgaps, which prohibit the propagation of photons having energies within the bandgap region. Straightforward application of the bandgap concept is generally thought to require three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystals; their two-dimensional (2D) counterparts confine light in the crystal plane, but not in the perpendicular z direction, which inevitably leads to diffraction losses. Nonetheless, 2D photonic crystals still attract interest because they are potentially more amenable to fabrication by existing techniques and diffraction losses need not seriously impair utility. Here we report the fabrication of a waveguide-coupled photonic crystal slab (essentially a free-standing 2D photonic crystal) with a strong 2D bandgap at wavelengths of about 1.5 microm, yet which is capable of fully controlling light in all three dimensions. These features confirm theoretical calculations on the possibility of achieving 3D light control using 2D bandgaps, with index guiding providing control in the third dimension, and raise the prospect of being able to realize unusual photonic-crystal devices, such as thresholdless lasers."

https://openalex.org/W1516922092,"The shape and chemical composition of solid surfaces can be controlled at a mesoscopic scale. Exposing such structured substrates to a gas that is close to coexistence with its liquid phase can produce quite distinct adsorption characteristics compared to those of planar systems, which may be important for technologies such as super-repellent surfaces or micro-fluidics. Recent studies have concentrated on the adsorption of liquids on rough and heterogeneous substrates, and the characterization of nanoscopic liquid films. But the fundamental effect of geometry on the adsorption of a fluid from the gas phase has hardly been addressed. Here we present a simple theoretical model which shows that varying the shape of the substrate can exert a profound influence on the adsorption isotherms of liquids. The model smoothly connects wetting and capillary condensation through a number of examples of fluid interfacial phenomena, and opens the possibility of tailoring the adsorption properties of solid substrates by sculpting their surface shape."

PPARδ is expressed in preadipocytes, but the importance of this PPAR subtype in adipogenesis has been a matter of debate. Here we present a critical evaluation of the role of PPARδ in adipocyte differentiation. We demonstrate that treatment of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing PPARδ with standard adipogenic inducers led to induction of PPARγ2 expression and terminal adipocyte differentiation in a manner that was strictly dependent on simultaneous administration of a PPARδ ligand and methylisobutylxanthine (MIX) or other cAMP elevating agents. We further show that ligands and MIX synergistically stimulated PPARδ-mediated transactivation. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, simultaneous administration of a PPARδ-selective ligand and MIX significantly enhanced the early expression of PPARγ and ALBP/aP2, but only modestly promoted terminal differentiation as determined by lipid accumulation. Finally, we provide evidence that synergistic activation of PPARδ promotes mitotic clonal expansion in 3T3-L1 cells with or without forced expression of PPARδ. In conclusion, our results suggest that PPARδ may play a role in the proliferation of adipocyte precursor cells, whereas activation of endogenous PPARδ in 3T3-L1 cells appears to have only minor impact on the processes leading to terminal adipocyte differentiation.

The PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that bind as heterodimers with members of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) subfamily to PPAR response elements (PPREs) in the promoters/enhancers of responsive genes. The PPARs are activated by a large variety of fatty acids and fatty acid metabolites, and direct binding of many of these activators to PPARs has been demonstrated (9Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M.

Whereas the role of PPARγ in adipocyte differentiation is well documented, the function of PPARδ has been a matter of dispute. In 3T3-F442A, 3T3-L1, and Ob1771 preadipocytes, PPARδ is expressed at the inception of differentiation, prior to the induction of PPARγ expression (28Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2367-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of PPARδ in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts was shown not to promote adipocyte differentiation (34Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). However, ectopic expression of PPARδ in 3T3-C2 cells has been shown to confer fatty acid-dependent expression of adipocyte marker genes (33Amri E.-Z. Bonino F. Ailhaud G. Abumrad N.A. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2367-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fatty acid treatment of 3T3-C2 cells with forced expression of PPARδ was demonstrated to promote both the expression of PPARγ and adipose conversion, the latter in a manner depending on the combined treatment with fatty acids and a selective PPARγ ligand (35Bastie C. Holst D. Gaillard D. Jehl-Pietri C. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21920-21925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that gonadal adipose tissue mass was reduced in PPARδ knockout female mice, suggesting a modulatory function of PPARδ in preadipocyte proliferation and/or adipogenesis in vivo (36Peters J.M. Lee S.S.T. Li W. Ward J.M. Gavrilova O. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Hudson L.D. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5119-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). However, the role of PPARδ in normal preadipocyte gene expression and differentiation, if any, is poorly understood. In this report we present a critical evaluation of the potential of PPARδ as an adipogenic inducer and the effect of activation of endogenous PPARδ in adipose conversion of preadipocytes. We provide evidence that PPARδ-mediated transactivation is synergistically enhanced by combined treatment with ligand and a cAMP-elevating agent, and that this combination allowed adipocyte differentiation of NIH-3T3 cells with forced expression of PPARδ. We show that activation of endogenously or ectopically expressed PPARδ in 3T3-L1 and NIH-3T3 cells promoted mitotic clonal expansion. However, even though synergistic activation of endogenous PPARδ in preadipocytes enhanced the expression of the key adipogenic regulator PPARγ, terminal differentiation was only modestly promoted, indicating that PPARδ activation is not a decisive factor in terminal differentiation of adipocytes, but rather plays a role in the expansion of the pool of precursor cells. The retroviral expression vector pBabe-mPPARδ (gift from B. M. Spiegelman) has been described (34Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M.

NIH-3T3 cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method in six-well plates. Fifty percent confluent cells per well were transfected with reporter plasmid (3 μg), PPARδ and RXRα expression vectors (1 μg of each), and pSV-β-galactosidase (0.5 μg). Empty expression vectors were added to a total of 5.5 μg of DNA/well.

Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and/or MIX (Sigma). The total concentration of vehicle was kept constant by the addition of Me2SO (to 0.1%) and/or potassium hydroxide (1% 0.1n potassium hydroxide). Cells were analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities by standard procedures. Phoenix cells were transfected with viral DNA at 50% confluence. Forty-eight h after transfection, virus supernatant was harvested and filtered. Fifty percent confluent NIH-3T3 or 3T3-L1 cells were transduced with virus supernatant diluted with one volume of fresh growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% bovine serum) in the presence of 6 μg/ml Polybrene. The following day, the cells were split and subjected to puromycin (Sigma) selection (2 μg/ml). Approximately 5 days later, the selected clones were pooled and replated for differentiation. Selected NIH-3T3 cells were grown to confluence in DMEM containing 10% bovine serum and puromycin. At confluence, puromycin was withdrawn and cells were left for 2 days in DMEM with 10% bovine serum. Two-day postconfluent cells (designated day 0) were induced to differentiate with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), dexamethasone (1 μm) (Sigma), and insulin (1 μg/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). MIX (0.5 mm) and PPAR ligands were added as indicated. After 48 h, the cells were refed with DMEM containing 10% FBS supplemented with 1 μg/ml insulin and ligand (when added). From day 4, medium consisted of DMEM with 10% FBS and ligand (when added) and cells were refed every other day. Cells not treated with PPAR ligands or MIX received similar volumes of vehicle (0.05% Me2SO and 1% 0.1 n potassium hydroxide, respectively). Ligands used for NIH-PPARδ and NIH-vector cells were 2-bromopalmitate,l-165041, and BRL49653 (kindly provided by Novo Nordisk). Untransduced 3T3-L1 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% bovine serum. Two-day postconfluent 3T3-L1 cells (designated day 0) were induced to differentiate by exposure for 4 days to DMEM with 10% FBS and insulin (5 μg/ml) and the combinations of MIX and PPAR ligands described in the legend to Fig. 6. Cells not treated with PPAR ligands and MIX received similar volumes of vehicle (0.05% Me2SO and 1% 0.1 n potassium hydroxide, respectively). From day 4 to day 8, cells were exposed to DMEM with 10% FBS. Medium was replenished on days 2, 4, and 6. Oil Red O staining was performed as described (39Hansen J.B. Petersen R.K. Larsen B.M.

Shown is a quantification of DNA content in a representative experiment (± S.E.). B, 3T3-L1-PPARδ cells were treated as indicated and labeled with BrdUrd (BrdU) in the period between 12 and 24 h after the start of the treatment. Cells incorporating BrdUrd in this 12-h period were detected by incubating fixed cells with monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (upper panel).

All reactions contained the TBP or the β-actin primer sets as internal standards together with up to two additional primer sets. A representative result for β-actin and/or TBP is shown in all figures. Relative cell numbers were determined by fluorometry using Hoechst 33258-staining of sonicated cells. Briefly, selected 3T3-L1 and NIH-3T3 cells treated for the indicated periods of time were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended and frozen in high salt buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 2m NaCl) (pH 7.4). Before measurement, the cells were thawed, sonicated and diluted in high salt buffer (with only 2 mm EDTA) containing Hoechst 33258 (0.1 μg/ml). Samples were measured using a DyNA Quant™ 200 (Hoefer). All samples were diluted to be in the linear range upon measurement. BrdUrd incorporations were carried out using the 5-Bromo-2′-deoxy-uridine Labeling and Detection Kit I according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Previous work has established PPARγ as a major regulator of adipocyte differentiation (28Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar). Forced expression of PPARδ was found not to support adipocyte differentiation of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (34Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), whereas forced expression of PPARδ in 3T3-C2 cells was reported to promote adipocyte differentiation in a manner depending on the sequential administration of fatty acids and a PPARγ-selective ligand (35Bastie C. Holst D. Gaillard D. Jehl-Pietri C. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21920-21925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we decided to re-investigate the differentiation potential of PPARδ in NIH-3T3 cells using retrovirus-mediated expression together with a standard differentiation protocol including the combined treatment with dexamethasone, MIX, and insulin (in this study referred to as DMI treatment). Expression of PPARδ in the selected NIH-3T3 cells was verified by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Cells transduced with the empty virus (NIH-vector cells) expressed moderate and low levels of endogenous PPARδ mRNA and protein, respectively, and the cells transduced with virus encoding PPARδ exhibited a significant increase in the levels of PPARδ mRNA and protein (data not shown). Initially, we employed 2-bromopalmitate as ligand in the treatment of NIH-PPARδ cells. DMI treatment alone or in combination with 2-bromopalmitate promoted no accumulation of lipid in NIH-vector cells as determined by Oil Red O staining (Fig.1, middle row ofdishes). This shows that no differentiation of the NIH-3T3 cells occurred in the absence of ectopic expression of PPARs when treated with the DMI differentiation protocol in combination with 2-bromopalmitate or other ligands (Fig. 1 and see below). However, we observed a strong ligand-dependent lipid accumulation in NIH-PPARδ cells in response to treatment with DMI and 2-bromopalmitate (Fig. 1, upper row ofdishes). Thus, forced expression of PPARδ promotes adipocyte differentiation of NIH-3T3 cells. To molecularly characterize the adipose conversion of PPARδ-expressing NIH-3T3 cells, we performed a time-course analysis of gene expression by multiplex RT-PCR and Western blotting. In accordance with the lipid-accumulating phenotype of the NIH-PPARδ cells treated with DMI and 2-bromopalmitate, induction of PPARγ2 and GPDH mRNAs was observed (Fig.2 A). At the protein level, this was accompanied by induction of PPARγ2 and adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP)/aP2 (Fig. 2 B). It is noteworthy that no PPARγ1 mRNA was detectable, implying that only the PPARγ2 promoter was active in the NIH-PPARδ adipocytes (Fig.2 A). C/EBPα mRNA is induced to only very low levels in the differentiated NIH-PPAR cells, an observation consistent with previous findings (40El-Jack A.K. Hamm J.K. Pilch P.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 41Wu Z. Xie Y. Morrison R.F. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A slight induction of PPARγ2 mRNA was observed in NIH-PPARδ cells treated with DMI in the absence of ligand, but protein accumulation was below the detection limit as determined by Western blotting. In NIH-vector cells treated with DMI and 2-bromopalmitate (or other ligands), expression of adipocyte marker genes was very low, consistent with the lack of differentiation (data not shown and see Fig. 3).Figure 3Expression of adipocyte markers during differentiation of NIH-PPARδ cells induced by a selective PPAR δ ligand. NIH-vector and NIH-PPARδ cells were induced to differentiate with DMI in the absence or presence of ligands. RNA was isolated on the indicated days of the differentiation program, and the expression of PPARγ2 (22 cycles), PPARγ1 (22 cycles) (not detectable and not shown), C/EBPα (25 cycles), ALBP/aP2 (17 cycles), GPDH (18 cycles), β-actin (17 or 18 cycles), and TBP (22 or 25 cycles) was analyzed by multiplex RT-PCR.

DMSO, Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ligand used above to demonstrate adipose conversion of NIH-PPARδ cells was 2-bromopalmitate, an activator of all three PPAR subtypes (34Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Although 2-bromopalmitate did not promote the differentiation of NIH-vector cells (see Fig. 1), it has been shown to cause adipose conversion of NIH-3T3 cells ectopically expressing PPARγ (34Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine to what extent the adipogenic effect of 2-bromopalmitate on NIH-PPARδ cells was mediated by the activation of ectopically expressed PPARδ relative to endogenous PPARγ, we next employed a ligand selective for PPARδ.l-165041 is a nonthiazolidinedione agonist of PPARs with selectivity toward PPARδ (15Berger J. Leibowitz M.D. Doebber T.W. Elbrecht A. Zhang B. Zhou G. Biswas C. Cullinan C.A. Hayes N.S. Li Y. Tanen M. Ventre J. Wu M.S. Berger G.D. Mosley R. Marquis R. Santini C. Sahoo S.P. Tolman R.L. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6718-6725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We used l-165041 at a concentration shown to activate only the PPARδ subtype in COS-1 cells (15Berger J. Leibowitz M.D. Doebber T.W. Elbrecht A. Zhang B. Zhou G. Biswas C. Cullinan C.A. Hayes N.S. Li Y. Tanen M. Ventre J. Wu M.S. Berger G.D. Mosley R. Marquis R. Santini C. Sahoo S.P. Tolman R.L. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. J. Biol.

The majority of NIH-PPARδ cells treated with DMI and 0.5 μml-165041 underwent adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 1, upper row ofdishes). In a separate experiment, we demonstrated that treatment with DMI and 0.1 μm L165041 also induced significant adipose conversion of NIH-PPARδ cells (data not shown). Even though 0.5 μml-165041 is a more potent PPARδ activator than 30 μm 2-bromopalmitate (see Fig.5 A), 2-bromopalmitate apparently was a more potent inducer of terminal differentiation as visualized by Oil Red O staining (Fig.1, upper row of dishes). This most likely relates to the ability of 2-bromopalmitate to activate both PPARδ and PPARγ, whereby 2-bromopalmitate first activates the ectopically expressed PPARδ, which in turn promotes the expression of PPARγ. PPARγ is then also activated by 2-bromopalmitate, thereby strongly promoting terminal differentiation. As a further control, we treated NIH-PPARδ cells with the PPARγ-selective ligand BRL49653. Interestingly, when BRL49653 was added at a concentration sufficient to activate only PPARγ (0.5 μm) (13Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol.

The mechanisms responsible for this paradoxical regulation of 5-HT2A receptors are unknown. In this study, the arrestin and dynamin dependences of agonist- and antagonist-mediated internalization were investigated in live cells using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged 5-HT2A receptors (SR2-GFP). Preliminary experiments indicated that GFP tagging of 5-HT2A receptors had no effect on either the binding affinities of several ligands or agonist efficacy. Likewise, both the native receptor and SR2-GFP were internalized via endosomes in vitro. Experiments with a dynamin dominant-negative mutant (dynamin K44A) demonstrated that both agonist- and antagonist-induced internalization were dynamin-dependent. By contrast, both the agonist- and antagonist-induced internalization of SR2-GFP were insensitive to three different arrestin (Arr) dominant-negative mutants (Arr-2 V53D, Arr-2-(319–418), and Arr-3-(284–409)). Interestingly, 5-HT2A receptor activation by agonists, but not antagonists, induced greater Arr-3 than Arr-2 translocation to the plasma membrane.

Neurobiol. 1998; 12: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 5-HT2Areceptors also mediate the actions of hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide, 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine, andN,N-dimethyltryptamine by activating 5-HT2A receptors located on cortical pyramidal neurons (2Aghajanian G.K.

For many years, it has been clear that a large number of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including opiate receptors (5Roth B.L. Laskowski M. Coscia C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are found in coated vesicles and various intracellular vesicles associated with endocytic pathways. Studies with the β-adrenergic receptor in particular have delineated a general pathway for agonist-mediated internalization by which agonist-induced activation of receptors leads to receptor phosphorylation and then the binding of arrestin to phosphorylated receptors (10Ferguson S.S.

Arrestin binding appears to facilitate translocation of phosphorylated GPCRs to clathrin-coated pits and the eventual internalization of GPCRs via the endosome pathway. Interactions of the C terminus of arrestin with clathrin (12Goodman O. Krupnick J. Santini F. Gurevich V. Penn R. Gagnon A. Keen J. Benovic J. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar) and the AP-2 adaptor protein (13Laporte S. Oakley R. Holt J. Barak L. Caron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) appear to be essential for arrestin-mediated internalization of many GPCRs. 5-HT2A receptors are subject to unique modes of regulation compared with other GPCRs. Thus, as previously reported, both agonists and antagonists induce down-regulation and internalization of 5-HT2A receptors in vitro and in vivo(14Berry S. Shah M. Khan N. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 306-313PubMed Google Scholar, 15Willins D. Berry S. Alsayegh L. Backstrom J. Sanders-Bush E. Roth B.L.

Since antagonist binding does not lead to receptor activation, it is difficult to imagine how antagonists could induce either internalization or arrestin binding, assuming that the process delineated for β-adrenergic receptors is universal for GPCRs. Accordingly, in this set of studies, we examined the arrestin and dynamin sensitivities for the agonist- and antagonist-mediated internalization of 5-HT2A receptors in vitro. As we report, both the agonist- and antagonist-induced internalization of 5-HT2A receptors are dynamin-dependent and arrestin-independent. Furthermore, we report that even though the agonist-induced internalization is arrestin-independent, activation of 5-HT2A receptors leads to a redistribution of βArr-1 (Arr-2), β-Arr-2 (Arr-3), and truncated Arr-2 (Arr-2(319–418)) into plasma membrane domains and intracellular vesicles distinct from those containing 5-HT2A receptors. Our results imply a novel and distinct sorting pathway for Arr-2 and Arr-3 that occurs independently of 5-HT2A receptor internalization. A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged rat 5-HT2A fusion protein (SR2-GFP) was constructed by amplifying the entire coding region of the 5-HT2A receptor including 15 base pairs of the 5′-untranslated region in-frame using Pfu polymerase and subcloning it into the vector pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH). Clones containing inserts in the appropriate orientation were verified by automated sequencing (Cleveland Genomics, Inc.) of the entire insert. A rat arrestin-2 dominant-negative mutant (Arr-2 V53D) was provided by Dr. Marc Caron (Duke University); the carboxyl-terminal arrestin-2 (Arr-2(319–418); CT-Arr-2) and arrestin-3 (Arr-3(284–409); CT-Arr-3) dominant-negative mutants were prepared as previously detailed, as were Arr-2 and Arr-3 full-length eukaryotic expression vectors (12Goodman O.

Mono- and polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies were from CLONTECH; polyclonal 5-HT2A receptor amino terminus-specific and arrestin-3-specific antibodies have been previously described (14Berry S. Shah M.

A rabbit polyclonal CT-Arr-2-specific antibody was generated using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing residues 357–418 of bovine arrestin-2 as antigen. The rat 5-HT2Areceptor was FLAG epitope-tagged on the amino-terminal extracellular domain by subcloning into pCMV-TAG2B (Stratagene) with the introduction of a consensus Factor Xa cleavage site (IEGR) between the FLAG epitope and the amino terminus of 5-HT2Ato yield FLAG-2A. In brief, polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-aaaggatccatcgagggccgcggaggtatggaaattctttgtgaag-3′ and 5′-tttggatcctcacacacagctaaccttttc-3′, introducing a BamHI cleavage site for in-frame insertion into pCMV-TAG2B. The entire insert was subjected to automated sequencing to confirm that the FLAG tag was in-frame and that no polymerase chain reaction-induced mutations occurred during the amplification. HEK-293 cells were plated onto 6-well, 35-mm plates at ∼0.5 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. At 24 h after plating, cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) exactly as described by the manufacturer. For cotransfection experiments, the total amount of DNA transfected was kept constant by the addition of empty vector (pcDNA3). At 24 h after transfection, cells were split into 24-well plates containing polylysine-coated coverslips and grown for an additional 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed serum. The next day, the medium was removed; and after washing with serum-free medium, the cells were incubated overnight with serum-free DMEM to remove 5-HT present in the serum. Following various treatments, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min, lightly permeabilized on ice (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 20 min, and incubated with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin and 1% gelatin in PBS) for 1 h. Cells were then incubated overnight with the following antibodies diluted in blocking buffer: a 5-HT2A receptor amino terminus-specific antibody (Ab51; 1:3000 dilution) (14Berry S. Shah M. Khan N. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 306-313PubMed Google Scholar), mono- and polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (1:5000 dilution), anti-CT-Arr-2 antibody (1:3000 dilution), and a monoclonal anti-arrestin-2 antibody (1:3000 dilution) (19Gelber E.I. Kroeze W.K. Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Sinar C.A. Hyde E.G. Gurevich V. Benovic J. Roth B.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After warming to room temperature and washing with PBS, cells were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of either BODIPY-FL-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody or Texas Red-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (diluted in blocking buffer) for 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and mounted for fluorescent confocal microscopic evaluation as previously detailed (14Berry S. Shah M. Khan N. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 306-313PubMed Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy, all images were taken at an overall magnification via the microscope of ×1000; and in selected images, electronic magnification greater than ×1000 was obtained. For these studies, HEK-293 cells were plated onto sterile 35-mm cell wells that contained coverslips affixed to the bottom in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were then transfected as described above, incubated with DMEM containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 24 h, and switched to serum-free DMEM for an additional 24-h incubation. On the day of the experiment, cells were switched to indicator-free HEPES-buffered serum-free DMEM and placed on the heated stage of a Zeiss confocal microscope. In addition to a heated stage, a plastic tent enclosed the stage and objective so that a stream of heated air maintained the microscope objective and air surrounding the stage at 37 °C for the duration of the experiment. Images were automatically collected at 30-s intervals, and subsequent image sequences were used to compose movies using Quick-time Pro. Internalization was quantified as previously described using a computer-based image analysis system (14Berry S. Shah M. Khan N. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 306-313PubMed Google Scholar,15Willins D. Berry S. Alsayegh L. Backstrom J. Sanders-Bush E. Roth B.L. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Typically, 30–100 cells were quantified per experiment in a blinded fashion, and all experiments were replicated at least three times. Data were analyzed via Student's t test for comparison of independent mean values, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Surface biotinylation was done as described previously (15Willins D. Berry S. Alsayegh L. Backstrom J. Sanders-Bush E. Roth B.L. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with modifications. In brief, HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with FLAG-2A and either Arr-2 or CT-Arr-2 as described above in 100-mm dishes. The next day, cells were split onto 6-well polylysine-coated plates with DMEM + 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum; and 24 h later, the medium replaced with serum-free DMEM. The next day, cells were incubated with 5-HT (10 μm) or vehicle (PBS) for 15 min, placed on ice, rinsed with 2 ml of ice-cold biotinylation buffer (10 mm boric acid, 154 mmNaCl, 7.2 mm KCl, and 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 8.4), and then surface-biotinylated in a total volume of 1.0 ml with 0.8 mm biotin disulfide N-hydroxysuccinimide ester for 15 min on ice. The reaction was quenched with 2 ml of quenching buffer (0.192 m glycine, 25 mm Tris, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 154 mm NaCl, pH 8.3), and the cells were then lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (−EDTA), pH 7.40) for 15 min on ice. After clarification of lysates by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), lysates were incubated in a total volume of 1.0 ml with 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. Biotinylated proteins were then purified by centrifugation, followed by three washes with lysis buffer at 4 °C. After the final wash, biotinylated FLAG-2A was liberated from the agarose by the addition of 100 μl of SDS sample buffer and heating at 65 °C for 1 min. Samples containing equivalent quantities of protein were then run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose as previously described (15Willins D. Berry S. Alsayegh L. Backstrom J. Sanders-Bush E. Roth B.L. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, blots were blocked with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.40; TBST) containing 5% nonfat dry milk (blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) in blocking buffer for 2 h. Following extensive washing with Tris-buffered saline, blots were incubated with secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse, 1:2000; Accurate Chemical and Science Corp.) in blocking buffer for 1 h, washed extensively with TBST, and washed twice with Tris-buffered saline. Blots were then incubated for 1 min with chemiluminescence substrate and visualized and quantified using a chemiluminescence imaging system (Kodak Digital Science). In initial studies, we characterized the pharmacology and functional activity of GFP-tagged 5-HT2A receptors (SR2-GFP) and compared SR2-GFP with wild-type receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells. Table I shows that SR2-GFP and wild-type 5-HT2A receptors have similar expression levels and agonist and antagonist pharmacologies. These results demonstrate that GFP tagging does not lead to detectable changes in 5-HT2A receptor pharmacology or functional activity. Our prior studies of agonist-induced internalization of 5-HT2Areceptors suggested an endosome-mediated process (14Berry S. Shah M. Khan N. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 306-313PubMed Google Scholar). To verify that GFP tagging did not alter the trafficking of 5-HT2Areceptors, we performed dual-label, real-time experiments with SR2-GFP and Texas Red-labeled transferrin. Preliminary studies (data not shown) indicated that SR2-GFP was internalized coincident with transferrin, in agreement with our prior studies on the native receptor (14Berry S. Shah M. Khan N. Roth B.L. Mol.

We next cotransfected SR2-GFP with a dynamin dominant-negative mutant (dynamin K44A) to investigate the dynamin dependences of agonist- and antagonist-mediated internalization. For these studies, image sequences were converted to Quick-time Movie Format (see Supplemental Material). These image sequences clearly demonstrate that 5-HT induced a rapid internalization of SR2-GFP in live cells (Image Sequence 1 in Supplemental Material) and that the process of internalization was abolished by cotransfection with dynamin K44A (Image Sequence 2 in Supplemental Material). These image sequences also show that 5-HT induced a change in shape (Image Sequence 1 in Supplemental Material), which was unaffected by cotransfection with dynamin K44A (Image Sequence 2 in Supplemental Material). Further image sequences of live cells (Image Sequence 3 in Supplemental Material) demonstrate that clozapine induced internalization of 5-HT2A receptors without inducing a change in shape. By contrast, cells exposed to vehicle (Image Sequence 4 in Supplemental Material) showed neither shape change nor receptor internalization. These results indicate that shape change and agonist-mediated receptor internalization are independent processes. Analysis of a large number of cells from several experiments is shown in Fig. 1. As shown, 5-HT and clozapine induced similar degrees of internalization and were both equally sensitive to dynamin K44A. These results indicate that both agonist- and antagonist-induced internalization of 5-HT2A receptors are dynamin-dependent. We next examined the effects of agonist and antagonist exposure on arrestin subcellular distribution using Arr-2 and SR2-GFP. As shown in Fig. 2, agonist exposure induced minimal Arr-2 translocation. Similar results were obtained with cells expressing GFP-Arr-2 and native 5-HT2Areceptors (data not shown). After longer time periods of agonist exposure, a redistribution of Arr-2 became evident. As shown in Fig. 2, by 5 min of agonist exposure, a punctate redistribution of Arr-2 in the cytoplasm became evident, which was pronounced by 15 min of agonist exposure. At this time period as well, punctate accumulations of Arr-2 at the plasma membrane were also evident, although it was clear that these punctate accumulations were distinct from those containing SR2-GFP. No redistribution of Arr-2 was seen in cells that were exposed to 5-HT but not cotransfected with 5-HT2A receptors (data not shown). We next examined the arrestin dependences of agonist- and antagonist-induced internalization using three dominant-negative arrestins: 1) the carboxyl-terminal clathrin-binding domain of arrestin-2 (Arr-2-(319–418); CT-Arr-2) (20Krupnick J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar); 2) the Arr-2 V53D mutant, which has been used by many others (22Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar); and 3) an arrestin-3 dominant-negative mutant (Arr-3-(284–409); CT-Arr-3) (17Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34616-34622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the agonist quipazine (100 μm) and the antagonist clozapine (10 μm) both induced internalization of SR2-GFP, which was unaffected by coexpressing CT-Arr-2. We also quantified results from a large number of cells that were transfected with SR2-GFP + pcDNA3 (empty vector; negative control), SR2-GFP + dynamin K44A (positive control), or SR2-GFP + CT-Arr-2. As shown in Fig. 4, cotransfection with CT-Arr-2 had no significant effect on either agonist- or antagonist-induced internalization of SR2-GFP. Similar negative results were found with the dominant-negative mutant Arr-2 V53D (data not shown). As a positive control, the dynamin K44A mutant inhibited both agonist- and antagonist-induced internalization. Fig.5 shows that CT-Arr-3, an Arr-3 dominant-negative mutant, also had no effect on agonist-induced internalization of 5-HT2A receptors.Figure 5Agonist-induced internalization of 5-HT2A receptors is insensitive to an arrestin-3 dominant-negative mutant. HEK-293 cells were transfected with pRcCMV-SR2 + GFP-Arr-3 or pRcCMV-SR2 + Arr-3-(284–409). Shown are the means ± S.E. from experiments in which 50–100 cells were imaged and internalization of the 5-HT2A receptors was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A closer examination of the confocal images revealed a distinctive redistribution of Arr-2, Arr-3, and 5-HT2A receptors. Thus, after 5 min of agonist exposure, a redistribution of CT-Arr-2 to the plasma membrane and distinct presumably endocytotic vesicles was apparent. As shown at the 5-min time point in Fig.6, minimal colocalization of CT-Arr-2 and SR2-GFP was seen in endocytotic vesicles, even though therewas apparent translocation of CT-Arr-2 to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the CT-Arr-2 immunofluorescent puncta were clearly distinct from those in which SR2-GFP was localized (Fig. 6). Separate dual-label studies using a polyclonal CT-Arr-2-specific antibody and a monoclonal anti-AP-2 antibody indicated that the vesicles in which CT-Arr-2 is localized are AP-2 containing organelles (data not shown), in verification of prior studies (18Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the effect of quipazine on Arr-3 translocation. As shown in Fig. 7, quipazine (100 μm) induced a modest and rapid translocation of Arr-3 to the plasma membrane of cells transfected with GFP-Arr-3 and native 5-HT2A receptors. At later time periods, a redistribution of GFP-Arr-3 into intracellular vesicles distinct from those containing 5-HT2A receptors was evident (Fig. 7). No colocalization of GFP-Arr-3 and 5-HT2A receptors to intracellular vesicles was evident at any of the time points studied. Additionally, clozapine exposure led to neither GFP-Arr-3 translocation nor colocalization of GFP-Arr-3 with 5-HT2A receptors (Fig. 7). These results indicate that the agonist-induced internalization of 5-HT2Areceptors leads to a redistribution of GFP-Arr-3 to subcellular domains that are distinct from those occupied by 5-HT2A receptors. These results also indicate that clozapine induces internalization of 5-HT2A receptors without inducing Arr-3 translocation. Control experiments were performed with HEK-293 cells cotransfected with GFP-Arr-3 and β2-adrenergic receptors. In agreement with prior studies (23Barak L.S. Warabi K. Feng X. Caron M.G. Kwatra M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7565-7569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), isoproterenol (10 μm) exposure induced a rapid translocation of GFP-Arr-3 to the plasma membrane (data not shown). Additionally, in cells transfected only with GFP-Arr-3, 5-HT exposure did not change GFP-Arr-3 distribution (data not shown). Additionally, we sought to determine the effect of CT-Arr-2 on 5-HT2A receptor internalization using a biochemical assay of internalization. For these studies, we cotransfected HEK-293 cells with FLAG-2A and either Arr-2 or CT-Arr-2. Internalization of FLAG-2A was quantified by measuring the loss of surface-biotinylated FLAG-2A by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.8, FLAG-2A was internalized to a similar extent in cells cotransfected with either Arr-2 (61 ± 7%) or CT-Arr-2 (59 ± 6%). Additionally, the extent of internalization induced by 5-HT (61%) was quite similar to that measured by our image analysis technique (45–61%). To determine whether the differential sorting of 5-HT2Areceptors, Arr-2, and CT-Arr-2 was due to some artifact related to GFP tagging of 5-HT2A receptors, we did additional experiments using a FLAG-tagged 5-HT2A receptor (FLAG-2A). For these experiments, we cotransfected FLAG-2A with either Arr-2 or CT-Arr-2 and visualized FLAG-2A with a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody and Arr-2/CT-Arr-2 with a polyclonal CT-Arr-2-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 9 (A–C), after 5 min of 5-HT exposure, differential sorting of FLAG-2A and Arr-2 was seen. A similar pattern of differential sorting was seen for FLAG-2A and CT-Arr-2 (Fig. 9, D–F) following 5 min of 5-HT exposure. These studies indicate that FLAG-2A and SR2-GFP are sorted in an identical manner. The major findings of this study are that 1) agonist- and antagonist-induced internalization of 5-HT2A receptors in HEK-293 cells are dynamin-dependent and arrestin-independent and 2) the agonist-induced internalization of 5-HT2A receptors leads to a differential sorting of 5-HT2A receptors and β-arrestin-1 (Arr-2) and β-arrestin-2 (Arr-3) into distinct plasma membrane and intracellular compartments. These results demonstrate that novel sorting pathways exist for arrestins and 5-HT2A receptors. Additionally, since 5-HT2A receptor activation leads to a redistribution of Arr-2 and Arr-3, our findings imply that internalization-independent functions exist for Arr-2 and Arr-3. In addition to these novel observations, the results are important because they clarify a long-standing conundrum related to the study of 5-HT2A receptors. Since 1980 (24Peroutka S.J. Snyder S.H. Science. 1980; 210: 88-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar), it has been noted by a large number of investigators that various 5-HT2Aantagonists can induce 5-HT2A receptor down-regulationin vivo and in vitro (see Refs. 1Roth B.L. Berry S.A. Kroeze W.K. Willins D.L. Kristiansen K. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1998; 12: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and 25Roth B.L. Willins D.L. Kroeze W.K. Drug Alcohol Depend. 1998; 51: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar for reviews). Our prior studies (26Roth B.L. Ciaranello R.D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharmacol. Sec. 1991; 207: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), as well as those of others (16Newton R.A. Elliott J.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1031-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), have clearly demonstrated that the antagonist-induced down-regulation of 5-HT2A receptors occurs without significant changes in 5-HT2A receptor gene transcription. These results imply that the antagonist-induced down-regulation of 5-HT2Areceptors occurs via post-transcriptional mechanisms. Our recentin vivo and in vitro studies, in which we demonstrated that antagonists induce 5-HT2A receptor internalization in vivo and in vitro, imply that antagonist-mediated internalization is a prominent pathway for 5-HT2A receptor down-regulation (15Willins D. Berry S. Alsayegh L. Backstrom J. Sanders-Bush E. Roth B.L. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Studies delineating the cellular mechanisms responsible for GPCR internalization, however, have implied that antagonists cannot induce internalization and/or down-regulation because the internalization process is dependent upon receptor activation, followed by subsequent receptor phosphorylation and arrestin binding. 5-HT2Aantagonists do not activate 5-HT2A receptors using any measure of receptor activity (phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis or arachidonic acid release) and do not induce shape change (present findings). In fact, clozapine, the antagonist used in these studies, has been demonstrated to be a potent antagonist withnegative intrinsic activity at 5-HT2Areceptors (27Egan C.T. Herrick-Davis K. Teitler M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 85-90PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is difficult to reconcile a large number of prior findings that 5-HT2A antagonists can induce receptor internalization and down-regulation with most of the current models of GPCR regulation. Our present results, which indicate that both the clozapine- and quipazine-induced internalization are sensitive to a dynamin dominant-negative mutant (dynamin K44A) and insensitive to three different arrestin dominant-negative mutants (Arr-2 V53D, Arr-2-(319–418), and Arr-3-(284–409)), show that 5-HT2Aagonists and antagonists induce internalization via anarrestin-independent pathway. Since the pathway is dynamin-sensitive and since 5-HT2A receptors internalize via clathrin-coated vesicles (28Willins D.L. Alsayegh L. Berry S.A. Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. Friedman L. Khan N. Roth B.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 861: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and transferrin-containing endosomes (Ref. 14Berry S. Shah M. Khan N. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 306-313PubMed Google Scholar and present results), it is clearly an endosome-mediated process. It is unlikely that internalization occurs via caveolae since the present studies demonstrated that agonist-induced internalization occurs coincident with transferrin receptor internalization, which is a well accepted marker of endosome-mediated internalization. Additionally, our prior studies demonstrated that internalized receptors do not colocalize with caveolin in vitro (14Berry S. Shah M. Khan N. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 306-313PubMed Google Scholar,28Willins D.L. Alsayegh L. Berry S.A. Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. Friedman L. Khan N. Roth B.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 861: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our results also show that, although arrestins are not involved in 5-HT2A receptor internalization, activation of 5-HT2A receptors by agonists induces a translocation/redistribution of Arr-2 and Arr-3. Intriguingly, although Arr-2 and truncated Arr-2 (Arr-2-(319–418)) were redistributed to intracellular vesicles, minimal colocalization with 5-HT2Areceptors was detected. Prior studies have implicated the C terminus of Arr-2 as containing both clathrin-binding (20Krupnick J. Goodman O. Keen J. Benovic J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and AP-2 adaptor protein-binding (13Laporte S. Oakley R. Holt J. Barak L. Caron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) motifs. Our results imply that the C terminus of Arr-2 may be recruited to distinct plasma membrane and endocytic subcellular domains independently of GPCR internalization. This conclusion is supported by preliminary findings from triple-label studies in which we found that Arr-2 and CT-Arr-2 are redistributed, in part, to AP-2 containing vesicles that are distinct from those containing 5-HT2A receptors (data not shown). Quite recent studies (29Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) suggest that at least two distinct classes of GPCRs exist, depending upon their affinities for Arr-2 and Arr-3. The 5-HT2A receptor appears to fall into Group B since 5-HT2A receptors induce a very modest redistribution of Arr-2 and Arr-3. Prior studies by us (19Gelber E.I. Kroeze W.K. Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Sinar C.A. Hyde E.G. Gurevich V. Benovic J. Roth B.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Arr-2 and Arr-3 can bind to the purified third intracellular loop of the 5-HT2A receptor in vitro and that 5-HT2A receptors are colocalized with Arr-2 and Arr-3 in some, but not all, cortical neurons. The present studies imply that unknown neuron-specific factors regulate the interactions of Arr-2 and Arr-3 with 5-HT2A receptors in cortical neurons because minimal colocalization of Arr-2/Arr-3 and 5-HT2A receptors was evident in HEK-293 cells. If Arr-2 and Arr-3 are induced to redistribute by 5-HT2Areceptor stimulation, but fail to regulate internalization, what is the role for redistribution of Arr-2 to punctate domains on the plasma membrane and distinct intracellular vesicles? The present studies do not answer these important questions, although work in progress suggests that the C terminus of Arr-2 may regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42/44) activation via a pathway distinct from that used to internalize 5-HT2Areceptors. 2J. Woods and B. L. Roth, manuscript in preparation. Several control experiments were performed to verify that the results we obtained were not due to artifacts related to GFP tagging of 5-HT2A receptors or to the presence of endogenous 5-HT receptors in HEK-293 cells. Thus, we found that native 5-HT2A receptors and FLAG-tagged and GFP-tagged 5-HT2A receptors were differentially sorted from Arr-2 and Arr-3 during endocytosis. Additionally, we verified that CT-Arr-2 did not inhibit 5-HT2A receptor internalization using a biochemical assay of internalization (surface biotinylation). In fact, the extent of internalization induced by 5-HT was the same whether internalization was measured by confocal microscopy or by surface biotinylation (∼60% in both cases). Finally, in untransfected cells, no redistribution of Arr-2 or Arr-3 was seen after 5-HT exposure. Taken together, these results demonstrate that 5-HT2Areceptors may induce plasma membrane and intracellular sorting of Arr-2 and Arr-3 distinct from that of internalized 5-HT2Areceptors. Importantly, internalization per se is not a sufficient signal for Arr-2 or Arr-3 redistribution since clozapine, which induces internalization but does not activate 5-HT2Areceptors, does not alter the subcellular distribution of Arr-2 or Arr-3. Additionally, our results demonstrate that the dynamin-dependent, arrestin-independent modes of GPCR internalization occur coincident with redistribution of Arr-2 and Arr-3 to the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results are sufficient to conclude that novel internalization-independent modes of arrestin redistribution occur following 5-HT2A receptor activation."

We have used thisin vitro model and representational difference analysis to identify genes involved in the formation of new blood vessels.

HESR1 is detectable in all adult tissues and at high levels in well vascularized organs such as heart and brain. Its expression is also enriched in aorta and purified capillaries. Overexpression of HESR1 in endothelial cells down-regulates vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) mRNA levels and blocks proliferation, migration, and network formation. Interestingly, reduction of expression of HESR1 by antisense oligonucleotides also blocks endothelial cell network formation in vitro. Finally, HESR1 expression is altered in several breast, lung, and kidney tumors. These data are consistent with a temporal model for HESR1 action where down-regulation at the initiation of new vessel budding is required to allow VEGFR2-mediated migration and proliferation, but re-expression of HESR1 is necessary for induction of tubular network formation and continued maintenance of the mature, quiescent vessel.

Angiogenesis is a multistep sequence of distinct cellular processes beginning with degradation of extracellular matrix, then proliferation, and migration of endothelial cells (EC),1 followed by lumen formation and functional maturation (3Risau W.

Currently, two families of EC-specific growth factors are known to regulate these steps. The vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), together with the more widely expressed and pleiotropic fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), promote EC migration, proliferation, and tube formation (5Neufeld G.

The second family is composed of angiopoietins (Ang) 1–5, of which Ang-1 and Ang-2, acting through the Tie-2 receptor tyrosine kinase, are known to be critical for the later processes of vessel maturation and stabilization (10Suri C.

The VEGFs, which can drive all of the early stages of angiogenesis, act through two tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGFR1 (flt-1) (13de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar) and VEGFR2 (KDR/flk-1) (14Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D. Armellino D.C. Gospodarowicz D. Bohlen P.

In particular, it is not clear how sequential cellular processes can be triggered by continued or repeated exposure to the same stimulus, although a model for reiterative signaling has been proposed to explain FGF-induced branching morphogenesis in lung development (18Metzger R.J. Krasnow M.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1635-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar).To aid in further understanding the process of vessel formation, we wish to identify genes up-regulated in cultured EC induced to differentiate into capillary-like tubular networks. As a first step we have used the well characterized system of cultured EC forming networks in collagen gels (three-dimensional cultures) (19Montesano R. Orci L. Vassali P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 20Villaschi S. Nicosia R.F. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 291-299PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pepper M.S. Ferrara N. Orci L.

This system models the temporally regulated angiogenic processes of migration, alignment, and tube formation and likely involves many of the same genes.

The gene will be referred to asHESR1 in this report.HESR1 is widely expressed in the developing vasculature as well as in the presomitic mesoderm, brain, and limbs (23Kokubo H. Lun Y. Johnson R.L.

It is specifically expressed in atrial precursors, in the cardiac outflow tract, in aortic arch arteries, and in the dorsal aorta (24Nakagawa O. Nakagawa M. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 25Leimeister C. Externbrink A. Klamt B. Gessler M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 85: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In adult tissues HESR1 has been detected in heart, brain, and lung but was not localized to particular cells (24Nakagawa O. Nakagawa M. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Recently, the gene responsible for the gridlock mutation in zebrafish was cloned and shown to be identical to Hey-2 (Hrt-2, CHF-1), the second member of this family. Mutation of gridlock disrupts caudal blood flow due to failure of the anterior lateral dorsal aortae to merge into the single midline aorta (27Zhong T.P. Rosenberg M. Mohideen M.A. Weinstein B. Fishman M.C. Science. 2000; 287: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar).There is a high degree of homology in the bHLH domain between HESR1, HES, and Hairy; however, homology outside of the bHLH is low until the C terminus. HESR1 has a C-terminal tetrapeptide YRPW sequence homologous to the WRPW motif in the Hairy/HES family and the WRPY motif in the Runt family (28Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This domain interacts with groucho in flies (29Paroush Z. Finley Jr., R.L. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1994; 79: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) and the TLE family in mammals (30Grbavec D. Stifani S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and is necessary for transcriptional repression of downstream targets such as achaete-scute in flies and MASH in mammals.We have now analyzed the function of HESR1 in cultured EC and show that expression is essential for capillary-like network formation.RESULTSHuman EC, seeded into three-dimensional collagen gels, formed capillary-like networks within 18–24 h (Fig.1 B), whereas cells growing on top of collagen continued to proliferate and eventually formed a monolayer (Fig. 1 A). Network-forming cells retain their EC phenotype as shown by their continued expression of CD34 (Fig.1 C), a commonly used immunohistochemical blood vessel marker. The networks are composed of tubes as evidenced by the presence of lumens (Fig. 1 D), outlined by staining for the extracellular matrix protein βigh3 (36Skonier J. Neubauer M. Madisen L. Bennett K. Plowman G.D. Purchio A.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Significantly, when the gels containing the neovessels are transplanted into a skin pocket on a SCID mouse, the human vessels anastomose with ingrowing mouse vessels and are perfused with blood, indicating that the cultured cells are fully competent to form mature vascular networks 2J.

Several well characterized “angiogenic” genes were obtained, including the αv integrin and plasminogen activator inhibitor, suggesting overlap in gene expression between tube-forming cells in vitro and in vivo. 3M. Aitkenhead, S.-J. Wang, J. Mestas, C. Heard, and C. C. W. Hughes, submitted for publication. A highly represented fragment (27/138 clones) we obtained after three rounds of subtraction showed homology to human and Drosophila Hairy protein and mammalian hes genes and was further characterized. The A21 cDNA contained a single large open reading frame coding for a protein of 304 amino acids and was recently independently named HESR1 (23Kokubo H. Lun Y. Johnson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We also cloned and sequenced the mouse homologue, which has been variously named HEY-1 (25Leimeister C. Externbrink A. Klamt B. Gessler M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 85: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), HRT-1 (24Nakagawa O. Nakagawa M. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and CHF-2 (26Chin M.T. Maemura K. Fukumoto S. Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hsieh C.M. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6381-6387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).To confirm the differential expression of HESR1 in EC-forming tubes compared with migrating and proliferating EC growing in two dimensions, we isolated poly(A)+ mRNA from three- and two-dimensional cultures and used this for Northern blotting. A single species of ∼2.0–2.5 kb was detected in the three-dimensional tube but not in the two-dimensional cultures (Fig.2 A) consistent with the cDNA size of 2.2 kb and the reported transcript size for mouse of ∼2.3 kb (24Nakagawa O. Nakagawa M. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To analyze the time course of HESR1 expression during network formation, we harvested RNA and performed RT-PCR (Fig.2 B). In migrating and proliferating cells (two-dimensional cultures) HESR1 was absent or present at very low levels. Induction was rapid when the cells were embedded in collagen gels (three-dimensional) with expression peaking by 2 h. Expression then fell slowly over the next 15–18 h to a level still considerably higher than that seen in two-dimensional cultures.Figure 2Expression of HESR1. A,Northern blot of poly(A)+ mRNA (1 μg) from tube-forming (T) and migrating/proliferating (M) EC hybridized with psoralen-biotin-labeled HESR1. A single species of ∼2.5 kb, corresponding to the predicted HESR1 mRNA, was present in the tube forming EC but absent in migrating/proliferating EC. Equal loading was demonstrated using a GAPDH probe (bottom panel).B, time course of HESR1 expression. RNA was harvested from migrating/proliferating cells (two-dimensional) and from network-forming cells at the indicated times after plating into collagen gels (three-dimensional). RT-PCR was performed for HESR1, and this was normalized to GAPDH expression. Data are plotted in arbitrary units normalized to two-dimensional culture.One of four similar experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate tissue distribution in the adult, we used RT-PCR on mRNA prepared from several adult mouse tissues. A single band of the predicted size was detected (Fig.3 A), and its identity as mouse HESR1 was confirmed by sequencing. No bands were present when the RT step was omitted, confirming the absence of genomic contamination (data not shown). As a semi-quantitative estimate of relative abundance, we normalized HESR1 band intensities to those of GAPDH amplified in parallel and compared these to the tissue expressing the lowest level of HESR1 (kidney). This revealed a dramatic enrichment of HESR1 transcripts in well vascularized tissues such as brain (7.5 times) and heart (4.8 times), as well as high levels in aorta (4.5 times). These data are consistent with recently published data showing expression in brain and heart by multiple tissue Northern blot. The high level of sensitivity provided by RT-PCR allowed us to detect transcripts in other tissues not revealed by Northern blotting. So far we have been unable to detect HESR1 mRNA in adult tissues by in situhybridization, presumably due to low levels of transcript. All previousin situ hybridization studies have been on embryos. As an alternative strategy to confirm vascular expression of HESR1 in vivo, we used RT-PCR on mRNA prepared from highly purified, freshly isolated adipose-derived capillaries (Fig. 3 B). We obtained a strong signal indicating that HESR1 is indeed expressed in capillaries in vivo, most likely by EC; however, expression in both EC and pericytes cannot be ruled out by our data. No signal was obtained in the absence of the RT step (data not shown). We also wished to determine whether levels of HESR1 are altered in the vasculature of tumors, but again in situ hybridization proved too insensitive. We therefore analyzed HESR1 expression in a multiple tissue tumor blot spotted with amplified cDNA from matched normal and tumor tissue. A potential problem with this kind of analysis is that up- or down-regulation of a gene may only be occurring in a discrete subset of cells and at discrete time points. In an analysis of bulk RNA, therefore, a signal may be masked by background noise. We believe this to be the case for HESR1 as we saw up-regulation in 3 of 3 lung tumors but down-regulation in 11 of 15 kidney tumors and 5/9 breast tumors (data not shown). This variation may reflect site of sampling (angiogenic edge or quiescent middle of the tumor), state of the tumor (rapidly growing compared with static or slow growing), or may reflect tissue-specific effects. More sensitive in situhybridization will help resolve this question.Figure 3Expression pattern of HESR1 in different adult tissues. A, RT-PCR performed on cDNA derived from various mouse tissues, using HESR1-specific primers, amplified a 355-bp fragment (upper panel). Expression of HESR1 was highest in brain, heart, thymus, and aorta and detectable in all organs tested. Amplification of a GAPDH fragment was used to confirm equal target cDNA from each of the organs (lower panel). TheMW lanes contain a 100-bp ladder, where the double intensity band is 600 bp long.

MWmarker lanes contain a 100-bp ladder, where the double intensity band is 600 bp long.One of three similar experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that in the adult HESR1 is expressed in mature vessels in all tissues, is decreased during migration and proliferation (two-dimensional cultures), and is re-expressed during the tube-forming stage of new vessel formation (three-dimensional cultures). This temporal expression pattern suggests that the level of HESR1 may regulate the phenotype of the EC, high levels acting to maintain quiescence while reduced levels may allow migration and proliferation. To test this hypothesis we constructed a HESR1 expression vector and used this to test the effect of HESR1 overexpression on EC phenotype. As a test of the plasmid, we performed in vitro transcription/translation of the pcDNA3-HESR1 plasmid, which revealed a single band of 31–33 kDa, consistent with the predicted size of 32,627 kDa for the conceptually translated protein (Fig. 4 A). To examine the effect of HESR1 on cell proliferation, ECs were transfected with pcDNA3-HESR1 or pcDNA3 control, along with pEGFPN-1 to monitor transfection efficiency, and cell number was monitored over 3 days by direct counting or XTT assay. By both assays there was a reproducible decrease in cell proliferation at all time points. In the XTT assay shown (Fig. 4 B) the decrease in proliferation was consistent with the transfection efficiency for this experiment of ∼10%. To confirm that HESR1 overexpression was not killing cells by inducing apoptosis, we stained HESR1 and control-transfected cells with 7AAD (35Philpott N.J. Turner A.J. Scopes J. Westby M. Marsh J.C. Gordon-Smith E.C. Dalgleish A.G. Gibson F.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 2244-2251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By FACS, transfected and apoptotic cells appear GFP bright and 7AAD bright, respectively. This population represented 2.9% of the total in control-transfected cells and 2.1% of the HESR1-transfected cells (data not shown). Salicylate-induced apoptosis was used as a positive control and yielded 27% positive cells. These data indicate that there is no increase in apoptosis in response to HESR1 expression. Finally, we counted floating (dead) cells directly, and again there was no significant difference at 3 days between control and HESR1-transfected cells (data not shown).Figure 4Overexpression of HESR1 suppresses proliferation.

A band corresponding to a 31–33-kDa protein was detected in lanes 1 and 3 but was absent in lane 2. B, EC were transfected with pcDNA3 control or pcDNA3-HESR1 and plated in 96-well plates. Transfection efficiency was assessed by cotransfection of pEGFPN-1 and for the experiment shown was 9%. At the indicated times cell number was assessed by XTT assay against a standard curve. Each data point is the mean of 12 replicate wells, and error bars fall within the symbol.

As shown in Fig. 5, HESR1 overexpression decreased migration by 25%. Taken with the effect on proliferation, these data suggest that HESR1 maintains EC quiescence and that HESR1 down-regulation may be essential to allow expression of the angiogenic phenotype.Figure 5Overexpression of HESR1 suppresses migration. EC were transfected with pcDNA3 control or pcDNA3-HESR1 and plated into transwells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transfection efficiency was assessed by cotransfection of pEGFPN-1 and for the experiment shown was 13%.

Our prediction was that, given the importance of EC migration in the early stages of angiogenesis, preventing migration by overexpression of HESR1 would block migration and proper alignment of the EC and therefore disrupt formation of the network. This indeed was the case. EC were transfected with control or pIRES2-EGFP-HESR1 and then sorted for GFP expression. When compared with EC transfected with a control plasmid, HESR1-overexpressing cells survived but were unable to generate extensive branching networks (Table I). There appeared to be a failure of “islands” of cells to interconnect, due to a lack of budding and branching. When the cultures were quantitated the data revealed an ∼50% decrease in the number of branch points in HESR1-transfected cells (Table I).Table IHESR1 overexpression suppresses network formationBranch pointsInterbranch distanceVectorHESR1VectorHESR1Exp. 141 ± 8.6 1-aMean ± S.E. of buds/branch points per field.21 ± 5.511.7 ± 1.0 1-bMean ± S.E. of interbranch distance in arbitrary units.12.0 ± 2.4Exp. 240 ± 4.021.8 ± 2.411.1 ± 0.68.3 ± 0.4EC were transfected with either pIRES2-EGFP control or pIRES2-EGFP-HESR1 and sorted for GFP expression.

Open table in a new tab Both EC migration and proliferation are driven by VEGF acting through VEGFR2, and consequently the receptor has a critical role in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Moreover, the promoter of VEGFR2 contains several E boxes, including one at position −175 that has been suggested to bind an EC-specific factor (38Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We wondered, therefore, whether VEGFR2 is a downstream target of HESR1 and whether HESR1 overexpression might down-regulate VEGFR2 expression. To test this, ECs were transfected with control vector or pcDNA3-HESR1 expression vector and harvested for RNA isolation 24 h later. Northern analysis revealed that overexpression of HESR1 in EC led to a dramatic down-regulation of VEGFR2 mRNA levels (Fig.6). Preliminary experiments suggest that HESR1 is acting at the transcriptional level as cotransfection of pcDNA3-HESR1 into EC blocks VEGFR2 promoter-driven luciferase expression. A similar effect is seen with theVEGFR1 promoter. 4A. M. Henderson and C. C. W. Hughes, unpublished observations. HESR1, like Hairy, HES, and E(spl), therefore appears to have a role in negative regulation of gene expression. These data suggest that HESR1-mediated inhibition of EC migration and proliferation is due, at least in part, to down-regulation of VEGFR2 and loss of responsiveness to VEGF. This interpretation is supported by our antisense experiments (see below) where we used a VEGFR2 antisense oligonucleotide as a positive control to block network formation.Figure 6HESR1 expression down-regulates VEGFR2 expression. Total RNA was isolated from HUVEC transfected with either control (pcDNA3) or HESR1 expression vector (pcDNA3-HESR1) and cultured for 24 h. The blot was probed with a fragment of the VEGFR2 gene generated by PCR. Intensity of the 18 S rRNA bands confirms approximately equal loading in each lane. One of two similar experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)By having determined that HESR1 is expressed in mature, quiescent vessels and that its down-regulation is necessary for the early stages of angiogenesis, namely migration and proliferation, we next wanted to determine whether re-expression of HESR1 is required for the later stages of EC alignment, tube formation, and network maturation.

Its activity is generally elevated in rapidly proliferating tissues, and nuclear matrix (NM) is an important subnuclear locale of its functional signaling. In the prostate, nuclear CK2 is rapidly lost commensurate with induction of receptor-mediated apoptosis after growth stimulus withdrawal. By contrast, chemical-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer and other cells (by etoposide and diethylstilbestrol) evokes an enhancement in CK2 associated with the NM that appears to be because of translocation of CK2 from the cytoplasmic to the nuclear compartment. This shuttling of CK2 to the NM may reflect a protective response to chemical-mediated apoptosis. Supporting evidence for this was obtained by employing cells that were transiently transfected with various expression plasmids of CK2 (thereby expressing additional CK2) prior to treatment with etoposide or diethylstilbestrol. Cells transfected with the CK2α or CK2αβ showed significant resistance to chemical-mediated apoptosis commensurate with the corresponding elevation in CK2 in the NM. Transfection with CK2β did not demonstrate this effect. These results suggest, for the first time, that besides the commonly appreciated function of CK2 in cell growth, it may also have a role in protecting cells against apoptosis.

It is a ubiquitous protein Ser/Thr kinase, localized in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus, existing as a heterotetramer consisting of α, α′, and β subunits (∼ 42, 38, and 28 kDa, respectively) with the possible α2β2, αα′β2, or α′α′β2 configuration. A number of putative substrates for CK2 have been identified in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Many of these are based on in vitro phosphorylation studies although a number of them have also been shown to be substrates for CK2in vivo. Among the nuclear substrates are proteins involved in growth including RNA polymerases, topoisomerase II, protein B23, nucleolin, SV40 large T antigen, certain proto-oncogene products, and growth factors, as well as certain nonhistone proteins, which might include transcription factors, etc. (for examples see Refs.1Ahmed K.

In previous work, we have demonstrated that CK2 is dynamically regulated with respect to its nuclear localization, such that chromatin and NM appear to be its preferential sites of association within the nucleus. The association of CK2 in these compartments is profoundly responsive to the status of growth stimuli (1Ahmed K. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1999; 9: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Tawfic S. Faust R.A. Gapany M. Ahmed K. J. Cell.

To that end, we have employed androgen action in the prostate epithelial cells that is mediated via the androgen-receptor system as an experimental model. It is well known that withdrawal of androgenic growth signal via castration of adult rats induces rapid apoptosis in the epithelial cells of the gland and that this process is reversed on androgen administration to castrated rats (14Berges R.R.

The treatment of castrated rats with androgen, and consequent induction of gene activity and cell growth in the prostatic epithelial cells, concurred with a rapid translocation of the CK2 from cytoplasm to the nuclear compartment such that the enhancement in the NM-associated CK2 was the most prominent (1Ahmed K.

The above studies also point to a hitherto unappreciated functional role of CK2, namely that growth stimulus-mediated changes in nuclear CK2 were associated not only with early growth responses but also with changes in apoptotic activity in the cells, depending on the availability of physiological growth factor signals such as androgens or other mitogenic growth factors (1Ahmed K. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1999; 9: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Guo C. Davis A.T., Yu, S. Tawfic S. Ahmed K. Mol. Cell.

Thus, under conditions of androgenic stimulation in the prostate the growth-related activities would predominate, whereas under conditions of growth stimulus withdrawal the apoptosis would predominate. This would imply that the presence or absence of CK2 in the nucleus may exert a significant effect on apoptotic activity. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, has been increasingly appreciated to play a significant role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis (for examples see Refs. 17Cohen G.M. Biochem.

The process of apoptosis can be initiated by either the receptor-mediated or chemical-mediated pathway. The former relates to withdrawal of growth stimuli (e.g. on androgen deprivation in the prostate), whereas the latter type of apoptosis is induced by physical agents such as γ-radiation or by chemicals such as etoposide. Some of the apoptosis-inducing chemical agents are known to induce DNA damage as an initial step, which is a distinguishing feature from receptor-mediated apoptosis (21Sun X.-M. MacFarlane M.

Our previous work employing receptor-mediated apoptosis in the prostate epithelial cells has shown a distinct response of NM-associated CK2 such that a rapid loss of CK2 from the NM compartment temporally precedes the appearance of apoptosis (1Ahmed K.

However, no such studies have been reported on the response of the CK2 signal in relation to chemical-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells. Considering the distinct nature of the receptor-mediated and chemical-mediated apoptosis, we decided to examine the nature of CK2 dynamics in the NM under the latter conditions. In the present paper we report that etoposide and diethylstilbestrol (DES), employed as models for chemical-induced apoptosis, demonstrate a distinctly different response of CK2 in the NM when compared with the previous observations on receptor-mediated induction of apoptosis. Unlike the latter, which evoked a rapid loss of CK2 from the NM in the prostate epithelial cells preceding apoptosis, the chemical-induced apoptosis mediated by etoposide or DES treatment of cells resulted in a dramatic initial increase in the CK2 association with the NM. A possible explanation of these results is that the presence of CK2 in the nuclear compartment may exert a protective role against apoptosis, in addition to its previously suggested role in activities related to stimulation of growth. A direct support for this notion was obtained from the observation that overexpression of CK2 by transient transfection of cells with expression plasmids of catalytic subunit CK2α or bicistronic holoenzyme CK2αβ resulted in a significant protection against chemical-induced apoptosis. The specificity of this action appears to reside in the catalytic subunit α of CK2, because transfection with the regulatory subunit CK2β did not afford such a protection. 2An abstract based on aspects of this work was presented at the 18th International Congress of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

Commun. 1994; 198: 898-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was purchased from Peptide Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD). Etoposide and DES were purchased from Sigma. Cell proliferation reagent WST-1 was supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The expression plasmids pCI-CK2α, pCI-CK2β, and bicistronic pCI-CK2αβ were prepared as detailed previously (26Yu S. Davis A.T. Guo C. Green J.E. Ahmed K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Anti-CK2α antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). TRIZOL reagent was from Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. Human prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). They were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, 10% defined FBS (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Culture medium for LNCaP cells also included 10−10m5α-dihydrotestosterone. Human prostate carcinoma cell line ALVA-41 was obtained from Dr. Richard C. Ostenson (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, 6% defined FBS in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. A cell line from squamous carcinoma of head and neck CA-9–22 was a gift from Dr. T. Kuroki, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. These cells were also maintained in the same medium used for ALVA-41 cells. Shionogi mouse mammary cancer cells were kindly supplied by Dr. John Isaacs of Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. They were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, 10−8m5α-dihydrotestosterone, 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped defined FBS in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The CHO cell line was purchased from CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA. They were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 6% defined FBS in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cell viability and proliferation was determined by employing the cell proliferation reagent WST-1, a tetrazolium salt that is cleaved by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells. Briefly, 100 μl of cell suspension (containing 0.5 to 2 × 104 cells) was plated in each well of 96-well plates. Cells were cultured for 24 h to allow reattachment. Following the treatment of cells with etoposide or DES, 10 μl of WST-1 was added to each well, and incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. An automated plate reader was employed to measureA 450. The transient transfection with expression plasmids pCI-CK2α, pCI-CK2β, and pCI-CK2αβ was carried out in PC-3 cells as described previously (26Yu S. Davis A.T. Guo C. Green J.E. Ahmed K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The period of transfection was 24 h, yielding a transfection efficiency of about 50–60%. These cells were treated with etoposide for varying periods of time as described in the text and figure legends. Control cells carrying only the pCI vector were treated in parallel in a similar manner. Similar approaches were followed for transfection of ALVA-41 cells. Subfractionation of cells to isolate NM was carried out as described previously (16Guo C., Yu, S. Davis A.T. Ahmed K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1146-1151PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yu S. Davis A.T. Guo C.

Biochem. 1997; 64: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All the procedures were performed at 4 °C except where indicated otherwise. Cells were scraped from the flasks after various treatments, washed twice with cold 0.9% saline solution, and then suspended in CSK Buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mmNaCl, 0.3 m sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 4 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complex, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for preparation of the cytosolic and NM fractions as described previously (16Guo C., Yu, S. Davis A.T. Ahmed K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1146-1151PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yu S. Davis A.T. Guo C. Green J.E. Ahmed K. J. Cell.

Biochem. 1997; 64: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The final NM fraction was suspended in a buffer consisting of 0.2 mNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. Protein content of these preparations was assayed as described previously (28Ahmed R.L. Davis A.T. Ahmed K. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 237: 76-79Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Synthetic dodecapeptide was used as the substrate to assess CK2 activity associated with various cell fractions (cytosol and NM) as described previously (16Guo C., Yu, S. Davis A.T. Ahmed K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1146-1151PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yu S. Davis A.T. Guo C. Green J.E. Ahmed K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Tawfic S. Davis A.T. Faust R.A. Gapany M. Ahmed K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction buffer consisted of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm synthetic dodecapeptide substrate, 0.05 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific radioactivity, 3 × 106 dpm/nmol of ATP). The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme source, generally as 20 μl of sample (equivalent to 2–10 μg of protein) and was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C. Control experiments were carried out to ensure that linear rates of reaction were obtained with respect to time and amount of the enzyme source. Samples were denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in a sample buffer consisting of 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 4 m urea, 2.5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and were subjected to SDS/urea/10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (16Guo C., Yu, S. Davis A.T. Ahmed K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1146-1151PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yu S. Davis A.T. Guo C. Green J.E. Ahmed K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose sheet. After blocking the sheet with a medium consisting of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl, 3% dry milk, the blot was successively incubated with mouse anti-human CK2α IgM and goat anti-mouse IgM-alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody. Immobilized alkaline phosphatase was visualized using 5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium as described previously (16Guo C., Yu, S. Davis A.T. Ahmed K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1146-1151PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yu S. Davis A.T. Guo C. Green J.E. Ahmed K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells subjected to various treatments were collected for total RNA isolation using TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Different amounts (0.2, 1, and 5 μg) of total RNA from each sample were used for hybridization with CK2α and CK2β cDNA probes as described previously (26Yu S. Davis A.T. Guo C. Green J.E. Ahmed K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated at least three times and included multiple replicates for each condition. The S.E. was determined for all assays, and where appropriate, statistical analyses were carried out to establish the significance of the results using ANOVA. To investigate the dynamics of CK2 in response to chemical-induced apoptosis, we have employed LNCaP, PC-3, and ALVA-41, three prostate cancer cell lines of diverse biological properties. Further, to confirm the general nature of these responses, we have also included three diverse nonprostate cell lines, which are Shionogi mouse mammary carcinoma, CA-9–22 (a squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck), and CHO (a noncarcinoma cell line). For induction of chemical-mediated apoptosis we have utilized two well established agents, namely etoposide (22Deptala A. Li X. Bedner E. Cheng W. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 861-871PubMed Google Scholar) and DES (29Robertson C.N. Roberson K.M. Padilla G.M. O'Brien E.T. Cook J.M. Kim C-S. Fine R.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); these drugs have also been employed as cancer chemotherapeutic agents. The results represented in Fig. 1 show that etoposide is a potent inducer of cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner in the three diverse prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, and ALVA-41. For example, the viability was most markedly reduced at concentrations of etoposide between 50 and 100 μm in the culture medium and was apparent within 20 h of treatment with the drug. The nature of the cell death under these conditions was confirmed by DNA ladder analysis, and Fig.2 shows a representative result of the effect of 48-h treatment of ALVA-41 cells with varying concentrations of etoposide (Fig. 2 A) and the effect of 30 μmetoposide over a period of 1 to 96 h (Fig. 2 B). These results confirmed that etoposide-induced cell death was via apoptosis; similar results were observed with the other two prostate cancer cell lines (result not shown).Figure 2Analysis of genomic DNA, CK2 activity, and immunoreactive CK2α in ALVA-41 cells treated with etoposide. A, DNA was isolated after a 48-h treatment with varying concentrations of etoposide. Lane a, no etoposide; lane b, 10 μm etoposide;lane c, 30 μm etoposide; and lane d, 100 μm etoposide. B, DNA was isolated from cells treated with 30 μm etoposide for various periods of time. Lane a, 0 h; lane b, 1 h; lane c, 8 h; lane d, 24 h;lane e, 48 h; and lane f, 96 h. Treatment of cells, isolation of genomic DNA, and agarose gel electrophoresis were as described under “Methods.” The amount of DNA in each lane is 10 μg. Arrows indicate the markers for size of the DNA fragments. C, ALVA-41 cells were treated with 30 μm etoposide for the periods of time shown, after which the CK2 activity was measured in the isolated fractions of cytosol (●) and NM (▿) as described under “Methods.” CK2 activity associated with NM of control ALVA-41 cells was 33.9 ± 3.1 nmol of 32P/mg of protein/h. CK2 activity in the cytosol of control ALVA-41 cells was 21.6 ± 2.0 nmol of 32P/mg of protein/h. CK2 activity in fractions from etoposide-treated cells is expressed as a percentage of that in the corresponding fractions from untreated controls ± S.E. D, ALVA-41 cells were treated with etoposide at varying concentrations for a period of 48 h, after which cytosolic and NM fractions were isolated. Cytosolic fractions (20 μg of protein each) and NM fractions (50 μg of protein each) were fractionated by gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot analysis by employing anti-CK2α antibodies. Lane a, controls (no etoposide added); lane b, 10 μm etoposide; lane c, 30 μm etoposide; and lane d, 100 μm etoposide. The relative densitometric values for cytosolic fractions were 1.00, 0.96, 0.25, and 0.19 for lanes a–d, respectively. The relative densitometric values for the NM fractions were 1.00, 1.28, 1.81, and 2.69 for lanes a–d, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 2 C shows that ALVA-41 cells treated with 30 μm etoposide over time evoked a marked change in NM-associated CK2 activity compared with the corresponding controls. This effect was time-dependent and was maximally apparent at about 48 h following the etoposide treatment of cells. Western blot analysis was undertaken to determine whether the change in the NM-associated CK2 in response to etoposide treatment was explained by translocation of CK2 from the cytoplasmic compartment, as observed previously when prostatic cells were subjected to changes in growth stimuli (1Ahmed K. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1999; 9: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Tawfic S. Faust R.A. Gapany M. Ahmed K. J. Cell.

Fig. 2 D shows a representative result employing ALVA-41 cells treated with varying concentrations of etoposide for a period of 48 h. The results suggested that etoposide treatment produced a dose-dependent change in the immunoreactive CK2α in the cytosolic and NM fractions such that a decrease was observed in the former compartment with a corresponding significant increase in the latter. Interestingly, a comparison of the relative change in the immunoreactive CK2 with that of the CK2 activity in the NM of cells treated with the highest concentration of etoposide suggested that the change in CK2 activity was somewhat greater than that in the immunoreactive CK2 (Fig. 2, C compared withD). This implies additional means that might influence the NM-associated CK2 activity under these conditions, as considered subsequently under “Discussion.” Fig. 3 shows the effect of varying concentrations of etoposide on ALVA-41, LNCaP, and PC-3 cells with respect to CK2 activity in the cytosolic and NM fractions. A small change was observed in the cytosolic compartment of each cell line; however, a remarkable dose-dependent change was apparent in the NM-associated CK2 in each cell line although the sensitivity of the three cell lines to etoposide varied somewhat. Thus, whereas the maximal effect was noted at 48 h of treatment with etoposide at a concentration of 30 μm for ALVA-41 cells, the concentration of etoposide required for similar effects on LNCaP and PC-3 cells was 100 μm. This correlated with the sensitivity of these various cell lines to induction of apoptosis by etoposide shown in Fig. 1. The effects of etoposide on growth of Shionogi, CA-9–22, and CHO cell lines were also studied (Fig. 4 A). The results indicated that cell growth was affected in a manner similar to that observed for prostate cancer cell lines (Fig. 1). Measurement of NM-associated CK2 activity in these cell lines showed an enhancement in CK2 in response to etoposide analogous to that observed for the prostate cancer cell lines (Fig. 4 B compared with Fig.3). In control experiments we established that treatment of ALVA-41 cells with etoposide at 10, 30, and 100 μm did not evoke a significant change in the expression of CK2α or CK2β mRNA over a time course of 0 to 48 h, as examined by slot blot analysis using CK2-specific cDNA probes. This suggests that the above-described effects were not due to changes at the transcriptional level. Likewise, addition of etoposide at these concentrations to isolated nuclei or nuclear matrix or purified CK2 had no influence on the enzyme activity thus ruling out a direct effect of this agent on the enzyme activity itself (results not shown). The effect of DES, another agent for induction of chemical-mediated apoptosis (29Robertson C.N. Roberson K.M. Padilla G.M. O'Brien E.T. Cook J.M. Kim C-S. Fine R.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), on growth of ALVA-41, PC-3, and LNCaP cell lines was examined. The results represented in Fig.5 A show that DES affects the growth of ALVA-41 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner similar to that observed for the effects of etoposide (Fig.1 A). Further, PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines also respond similarly to DES in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 B compared with Fig. 1 B). The nature of the cell death induced in these cell lines by DES as being due to apoptosis was confirmed by DNA ladder analysis (Fig. 5 C). The above results, taken together with our previous observations on receptor-mediated apoptosis in prostate cells and the associated changes in CK2 (1Ahmed K. Crit. Rev.

Our results confirm the key roles of Cys129 and Cys131 in CaR dimerization.

Thus there is currently no consensus as to the key cysteine residues within the CaR extracellular domain that mediate dimerization.

We showed that under reducing conditions, most mutant receptors, including those with almost undetectable mature forms such as R66C and R680C, show substantial amounts of SDS-resistant dimeric forms in addition to monomeric forms in SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels. In contrast, P747frameshift, a single-base deletion in codon 747 resulting in a truncated receptor lacking the second extracellular loop and the remainder of the C terminus, including the fifth, sixth, and seventh transmembrane domains, shows only a single monomeric species and no detectable higher molecular weight forms. Interestingly, a consensus dimerization motif (9Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) for noncovalent hydrophobic interactions is present in the CaR within TM5, that is missing in the P747frameshift. In the present studies, we have examined the roles of Cys101, Cys129, Cys131, and Cys236 in mediating disulfide-linked dimerization of the CaR and of covalent dimerization in the functional interactions between CaR monomers within the dimeric CaR. Mutating both Cys129and Cys131 slightly reduces cell surface expression of the CaR and abolishes most of the sulfhydryl-sensitive CaR dimerization on the cell surface. In contrast, mutating Cys101 and Cys236 severely reduces surface and overall expression of the receptor with no substantial conversion of dimers to monomers detected under nonreducing conditions. Furthermore, we show that the CaR still forms functional dimers even in the absence of these intermolecular disulfide linkages. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the approach described by Kunkel (10Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) to produce mutated receptors in which one or two cysteine residues present in the extracellular domain of the human CaR were mutated to serines. The dut-1 ung-1 strain of Escherichia coli, CJ236, was transformed separately with mutagenesis cassettes, as described previously (7Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R.

Uracil-containing, single-stranded DNA was produced by infecting the cells with the helper phage, VCSM13 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The single-stranded DNA was then annealed to a mutagenesis primer that contained the desired nucleotide change encoding a single point mutation flanked on both sides by wild type sequences. The primer was subsequently extended around the entire single-stranded DNA and ligated to generate closed circular heteroduplex DNA. DH5α- or DH10B-competent cells were transformed with these DNA heteroduplexes, and incorporation of the desired mutations was confirmed by sequencing the mutated cassettes. The resultant mutated cassettes were cloned into the FLAG-tagged or nontagged receptor in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), as described previously (7Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R.

Cassette 1, carrying C101S, was doubly digested withBsp EI and Nhe I, and the larger fragment obtained from the above digestions was ligated to the smaller fragment resulting from digestion of the CaR carrying C236S with Bsp EI andNhe I. Cassette 1 carrying C129S/C131S was doubly digested with Kpn I and Bsp EI, and the smaller fragment obtained from the above digestion was ligated to the larger fragment resulting from digestion of the CaR carrying E297K or A877Stop withKpn I and Bsp EI. The DNA for transfection was prepared using the Midi Plasmid Kit (Qiagen). LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was employed as a DNA carrier for transfection (11Hawley-Nelson P. Ciccarone V. Gebeyehu G. Jessee J. Felgner P.L. Focus. 1993; 15: 73-79Google Scholar). The human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells used for transient transfection were provided by NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). The DNA-liposome complex was prepared by mixing DNA and LipofectAMINE in OPTI-MEM I reduced serum medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubating the mixture at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA-lipofectAMINE mixture was then diluted with OPTI-MEM I reduced serum medium and added to 90% confluent HEK293 cells plated on 13.5 × 20.1-mm glass coverslips using 2.5 μg of DNA. After a 5 h incubation at 37 °C, equivalent amounts of OPTI-MEM I reduced serum medium with 20% fetal bovine serum were added to the medium overlying the transfected cells, and the latter was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 24 h after transfection. The expressed [Ca2+]o-sensing receptor protein was assayed 48 h after the start of transfection. To perform coexpression of two receptors, 1.25 μg of each of the two cDNAs were mixed and used to transfect HEK293 cells. Before preparing whole cell lysates, intact HEK293 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged CaR were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 1 mm ImmunoPure Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce), a membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent, at room temperature with constant agitation for 30 min to biotinylate the proteins on the cell surface. The reaction was then quenched by incubating the cells in 1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 5 min. For cross-linking experiments, we added an appropriate amount of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3), a noncleavable, membrane-impermeant cross-linker, into the labeling solution with ImmunoPure Sulfo-NHS-Biotin. The surface-biotinylated and/or cross-linked HEK293 cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors including 83 μg/ml aprotinin, 30 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), 50 μg/ml calpain inhibitor, 50 μg/ml bestatin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin (1× immunoprecipitation buffer) at room temperature. Insoluble material was removed by centrifuging the cell lysates at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected as total cell lysates. The protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay (Pierce). To a microcentrifuge tube, 5 μg of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, 400 μl of H2O, 500 μl of 2× immunoprecipitation buffer (see above), and 100 μl of total lysate containing ∼250 or 500 μg of total proteins were added. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. To the mixture was then added 5 μl of an anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). The incubation was continued for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. To the mixture was subsequently added 50 μl of 10% protein A agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) for a further 30-min incubation at 4 °C. The protein A-agarose was washed three times with 1× immunoprecipitation buffer, and the immunoreactive species were subsequently eluted in 45 or 60 μl of 2× electrophoresis sample buffer at 65 °C for 30 min. In a given experiment, the same amount of total protein for each sample was used for immunoprecipitation and was eluted with the same volume of SDS-sample buffer. The receptor of interest was detected by Western analysis. If not specified, 15 μl of eluted, immunoprecipitated sample was subjected to SDS-containing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar) using a linear gradient of polyacrylamide (3–10%). The proteins on the gel were subsequently electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% milk, the forms of the receptor present on the cell surface were detected using an avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) followed by visualization of the biotinylated bands with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After removal of the avidin using the recommended procedure for stripping the blots (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), all forms of the CaR on the same blot were detected using an anti-CaR antiserum (4641 or 4637, polyclonal antisera raised against two peptides within the extracellular domain of the CaR, kindly provided by Drs. Forrest Fuller and Rachel Simin at NPS Pharmaceuticals, Salt Lake City, UT) followed by a secondary, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and then an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Coverslips with HEK293 cells previously transfected with the appropriate CaR cDNAs were loaded for 2 h at room temperature with fura-2/AM in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 125 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% dextrose and then washed once with a bath solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 125 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% dextrose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C for 20 min. The coverslips were then placed diagonally in a thermostatted quartz cuvette containing the bath solution, using a modification of the technique employed previously in this laboratory (13Fajtova V.T. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E151-E158PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular calcium was increased stepwise to give the desired final concentrations with additions of [Ca2+]o in increments of 1 mm, which were followed by 5 mm increments after achieving a level of 5.5 mm [Ca2+]o and 10 mmincrements after reaching a level of 20 mm[Ca2+]o. Excitation monochrometers were centered at 340 and 380 nm, and emission light was collected at 510 ± 40 nm through a wide-band emission filter. The 340/380 excitation ratio of emitted light was used to calculate [Ca2+]i as described previously (13Fajtova V.T. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E151-E158PubMed Google Scholar). The mean EC50 values for the various wild type or mutant receptors determined in response to increasing concentrations of [Ca2+]o were calculated from the EC50 values for all of the individual experiments and were expressed with the S.E. as the index of dispersion. Comparison of the EC50 values was performed using analysis of variance or Duncan's multiple comparison test (14Duncan D.B. Biometrics. 1955; 11: 1-42Crossref Google Scholar) (p ≤ 0.05). Each of the experiments described above in the experimental protocols was generally performed at least three times. To examine the role of cysteines in the formation of functional CaR dimers, we first looked at single Cys mutations of the CaR. We constructed CaRs in which one of nine cysteines in the extracellular domain (Cys60, Cys101, Cys129, Cys131, Cys236, Cys437, Cys449, Cys482, or Cys598) was mutated to Ser. Transient expression of these CaRs in HEK293 cells showed that the mutations have varied effects on [Ca2+]o-elicited [Ca2+]i responses (TableI). Two of the mutant receptors, C129S and C131S, become substantially more sensitive to [Ca2+]o, with EC50 values that are 0.6 and 1.2 mm lower than the EC50 of wt, respectively, but with significant reductions in their maximal responses, which are 77 ± 4% and 54 ± 3% that of wt, respectively. One of the mutations, C482S, does not significantly affect receptor function. Others become less sensitive to [Ca2+]o than wt or are completely inactive (TableI). Most of the mutant receptors that have decreased sensitivities to [Ca2+]o also exhibit reduced maximal responses. The mutant receptors containing C236S and C598S have no detectable activity.Table I[Ca2+]o-elicited [Ca2+]i responses in cells transfected with CaRs carrying one or more cysteine to serine mutationsMutationsEC50[Ca2+]oMaximal Ca2+i responsemm%wt3.10 ± 0.071-aValues are means ± S.E.; values marked with asterisks are significantly (p< 0.05) different from the wild type CaR.

Open table in a new tab Consistent with the results of a previous study (15Fan G.F. Ray K. Zhao X.M. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), one group of mutant receptors carrying C129S, C131S, C437S, C449S, or C482S (Group I mutations in Fig. 1), exhibit nearly normal levels of expression on the cell surface and in whole cell lysates (Fig. 1, lanes 2, 3, and5–7). Of these receptors, C437S and C482S (Fig. 1A,lanes 5 and 7) have slightly higher cell surface expression than wt (Fig. 1 A, lane 1), whereas C129S, C131S, and C449S (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 3, and6) have somewhat lower cell surface expression than wt. In contrast, another group of mutant receptors carrying C60S, C101S, C236S, or C598S (Group II mutations in Fig.2), have marked reductions in their surface expression (Fig. 2 A). In Fig. 2, lanes 3–6, twice as much of the samples were loaded as those inlanes 1 and 2. The low apparent immunoreactivity of C236S toward the anti-CaR antibody, 4641, in Fig. 2 B,lane 5, is likely due to the fact that Cys236 is the last amino acid in the peptide (Ala214–Cys236) against which 4641 was raised and may be important for the binding of 4641 to the receptor. As shown below, C236S has a similar level of overall expression to that of C598S when it was detected with another anti-CaR antibody, 4637, which was raised against a peptide consisting of amino acids 344–358 in the extracellular domain of the CaR. Whereas C598S (Fig. 2 B,lane 2) had a much lower mature form than wt, two other mutant receptors, C60S and C101S, were even lower (Fig. 2 B,lanes 3 and 4). Note that twice the amount of eluted, immunoprecipitated samples were loaded in Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4, as in Fig. 2, lanes 1 and2. The mature forms of these mutant receptors areN-glycosylated with complex carbohydrates, corresponding to the upper bands of the doublets between 127 and 200 kDa (7Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Under nonreducing conditions, all of the mutant receptors with a single point mutation, behaving like wt, were present mostly as dimers or higher multimeric forms on SDS-PAGE (Fig.3 and 4) when we detect either only the surface forms or all forms of the receptor. However, longer exposure reveals trace amounts of monomeric CaRs for some of the mutant receptors (e.g. C129S, C131S, and C482) on blots stained for cell surface receptor proteins (Fig.3 A, lanes 2, 3, and 6). In contrast to previous studies with C60S, C101S, and C236S (5Pace A.J. Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11629-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Fan G.F. Ray K. Zhao X.M. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), no significant amounts of the monomeric species of these three mutant receptors were detected either on the cell surface or in the whole cell lysates (Fig. 4, lanes 2–4). As shown in Fig.4 B, lanes 4 and 5, C236S, has a similar level of overall expression to that of C598S when it was detected with 4637. Thus dimerization of wt appears to involve more than one intermolecular disulfide bond, necessitating mutation of two or more cysteines to identify those forming intermolecular disulfide bonds.Figure 4Detection of intermolecular disulfide-linked dimeric CaRs carrying one or two of the Group II mutations under nonreducing conditions. The samples were prepared as in Fig. 3. The same amount of total proteins, 250 μg, were immunoprecipitated and eluted with 45 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT in each case. The CaRs on the cell surface were determined using avidin (panel A) as in Fig. 1. The CaRs in the whole cell lysates were then detected with an anti-CaR antibody (4637) recognizing a different epitope from antibody 4641 after removal of the avidin (panel B). The samples in lanes 1–6 are wt (lane 1), C60S (lane 2), C101S (lane 3), C236S (lane 4), C598S (lane 5), and C101S/C236S (lane 6). Lanes 2–6 were loaded with 30 μl of the eluted, immunoprecipitated proteins, whereas lane 1 was loaded with 15 μl of the eluted, immunoprecipitated proteins. The monomeric and dimeric CaRs are indicated as M and D, respectively, on the right hand side of the figure and are marked with arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify cysteines forming intermolecular disulfide bonds, we constructed mutant receptors with two or more mutations of cysteines to serines but focused on those that had no detrimental effects on either receptor expression or function when studied as single mutations. We found that the mutant receptor, C129S/C131S, had a substantial level of expression on the cell surface (Fig. 1A, lane 4), although it was slightly lower than those of the mutant receptors with C129S or C131S alone (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 3). The activity of the mutant receptor, C129S/C131S, was also affected more than those of the two singly mutated receptors, C129S and C131S (TableI). C129S/C131S became even more sensitive to [Ca2+]o, with a lower EC50 than that of C129S and similar to that of C131S. The cumulative maximal response of C129S/C131S was significantly lower than those of the singly mutated receptors. Under nonreducing conditions, a substantial amount of monomeric C129S/C131S was detected when assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5, lane 2). Detection of the cell surface form of this receptor (Fig.5 A, lane 2) revealed that the monomeric receptor is the major species, unlike wt (Fig. 5 A, lane 1). In contrast, reprobing of the same blot with an anti-receptor antibody, detecting both cell surface and intracellular forms of the receptor (Fig. 5 B, lane 2), showed that the monomeric form of the receptor is a minor species. Thus, whereas a large fraction of the mutant receptor, C129S/C131S, no longer forms intermolecular disulfide bonds on the cell surface, the majority of intracellular receptor species either still forms intermolecular disulfide bonds or is resistant to dissociation of dimers to monomers during SDS-PAGE despite the lack of intermolecular disulfide linkages. When we examined mutant receptors carrying triple, quadruple, or quintuple mutations, we found that, like C129S/C131S (Fig.5 A, lane 2), substantial amounts of receptors containing both C129S and C131S no longer form intermolecular disulfide-linked dimers on the cell surface (Fig. 5 A,lanes 3 and 4). However, the major species in the whole cell lysates are still multimers (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3 and 4). Other receptors with multiple Cys to Ser mutations, containing either Cys129 or Cys131, still form exclusively disulfide-linked dimers on the cell surface and in whole cell lysates (data not shown). We also examined the properties of the mutant receptor with the two mutations, C101S and C236S (Figs. 2 and 4, lane 6). In contrast to a previously published study (5Pace A.J. Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11629-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the overall expression level of C101S/C236S (Fig. 4 B, lane 6) is equivalent to that of C101S (Fig. 4 B, lane 3) and much less than that of C236S (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). In addition, we found the surface expression level of C101S/C236S (Fig.2 A, lane 6), although detectable, much less than the mutant receptor carrying either mutation alone (Fig. 2 A,lanes 4 and 5). Under nonreducing conditions, there are no detectable mature monomeric species of the CaR in whole cell lysates even though we detected a trace amount of its immature form when the blot for Fig. 4 B was exposed for a much longer period of time (data not shown). This mutant receptor does show slight activity (Table I). Thus Cys129 and Cys131 appear essential for formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds in most of the cell surface forms of the CaR, similar to the result of Ray et al. (6Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27642-27650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, we still detect a substantial amount of dimeric C129S/C131S on the cell surface (Fig. 5 A,lane 2), even though it is a minor species relative to its monomeric counterpart. Next we examined whether the mutant receptor, C129S/C131S, which appears as a monomeric receptor in SDS-containing buffer without any dithiothreitol, may exist on the cell surface as noncovalently linked dimers. We utilized cross-linking of cell surface receptors and coimmunoprecipitation of cotransfected receptors as described previously (4Bai M. Trivedi S. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23605-23610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To determine whether the mutant receptor, C129S/C131S, forms cell surface dimers, we stabilized any preexisting dimeric or higher multimeric forms of the receptor by covalently linking them with BS3, a noncleavable, membrane impermeant cross-linker, and surface-labeled the cells with Sulfo-NHS-Biotin. The surface-biotinylated and cross-linked cells were then lysed in the presence of iodoacetamide. The FLAG-tagged C129S/C131S and wt were then immunoprecipitated, and the immunopurified CaRs were eluted with DTT-containing SDS sample buffer. Increasing the concentration of cross-linker causes a progressive rise in the ratio of dimer to monomer for both wt (Fig. 6,lanes 1–3) and C129S/C131S (Fig"

H. (1999) Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 14, 141–52), also known as EDG-8, binds sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) with high affinity and specificity. In this paper we examined the signal transduction pathways regulated by the binding of S1P to EDG-8. In Chinese hamster ovary cells heterologously expressing EDG-8, S1P inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation and activated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Surprisingly, S1P inhibited serum-induced activation of extracellular regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Treatment with pertussis toxin, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Gi, blocked S1P-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation, but had no effect on c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation or inhibition of ERK1/2. The inhibitory effect of S1P on ERK1/2 activity was abolished by treatment with orthovanadate, suggesting the involvement of a tyrosine phosphatase. A subunit selective [35S] guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding assay demonstrates that EDG-8 activated Gi/o and G12 but not Gs and Gq/11 in response to S1P. In agreement, EDG-8 did not stimulate phosphoinositide turnover or cAMP accumulation. The ability of S1P to induce mitogenesis in cells expressing the EDG-1 subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors is well characterized. In contrast, S1P inhibited proliferation in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing EDG-8 but not empty vector. The antiproliferative effect, like S1P-mediated ERK1/2 inhibition, was orthovanadate-sensitive and pertussis toxin-insensitive. Our results indicate that EDG-8, a member of the EDG-1 subfamily, couples to unique signaling pathways. The previously cloned rat nerve growth factor-regulated G protein-coupled receptor NRG-1 (Glickman, M., Malek, R. L., Kwitek-Black, A. E., Jacob, H. J., and Lee N. H. (1999) Mol. Cell.

A subunit selective [35S] guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding assay demonstrates that EDG-8 activated Gi/o and G12 but not Gs and Gq/11 in response to S1P. In agreement, EDG-8 did not stimulate phosphoinositide turnover or cAMP accumulation. The ability of S1P to induce mitogenesis in cells expressing the EDG-1 subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors is well characterized. In contrast, S1P inhibited proliferation in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing EDG-8 but not empty vector. The antiproliferative effect, like S1P-mediated ERK1/2 inhibition, was orthovanadate-sensitive and pertussis toxin-insensitive. Our results indicate that EDG-8, a member of the EDG-1 subfamily, couples to unique signaling pathways. sphingosine-1-phosphate lysophosphatidic acid sphingosylphosphorylcholine G protein coupled receptor pertussis toxin Chinese hamster ovary endothelial differentiation gene mitogen-activated protein extracellular regulated protein kinase phosphoinositide stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate hemagglutinin angiotensin II type 1 angiotensin II type 2 The lysophospholipids sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)1 and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) are endogenous ligands of the EDG family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (1An S.

Osborne N. Waldron S. Stainier D.Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Interestingly, EDG-8 is closely related to EDG-5, exhibiting 40–44% sequence identity.Edg-8, which was initially cloned from rat pheochromocytoma cells as the nerve growth factor-regulated orphan GPCR nrg-1(6Glickman M.

Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), possibly because of a gene duplication event. Thus, it is of great interest to examine the signaling pathways regulated by S1P binding to EDG-8 and its potential biological consequences. Unexpectedly we found that EDG-8 is mainly coupled to Gi/o and G12 and inhibits, rather than stimulates, ERK activation in CHO cells. Moreover, S1P markedly inhibits proliferation in CHO cells overexpressing EDG-8 in a Gi/o-independent manner.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that EDG-8, originally cloned as a GPCR termed NRG-1 (6Glickman M. Malek R.L. Kwitek-Black A.E. Jacob H.J. Lee N.H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), binds and is activated by S1P when heterologously expressed in CHO cells. CHO cells were selected to characterize EDG-8 because this cell line does not readily respond to S1P in the absence of exogenous EDG gene transfer (20Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Gonda K. Okazaki H. Chang K.

Furthermore, many studies relating to EDG-1, -3, and -5 signaling have been performed in CHO cells, thereby providing a common background for direct comparison to EDG-8 signaling (Tables I and II). The affinity of S1P for EDG-8 (K d = 6 nm) is similar to previously reported affinity values obtained for EDG-1, -3, and -5 (K d = 8–26 nm) (15Van Brocklyn J.R. Tu Z. Edsall L.C. Schmidt R.R.

Based upon the lysophospholipid ligands that were tested for their ability to displace [32P]S1P binding, the pharmacological profile of EDG-8 closely resembles other S1P-binding EDG-1 receptors. Moreover, similar to our previous results with EDG-1, -3, and -5, SPC (15Van Brocklyn J.R. Tu Z. Edsall L.C. Schmidt R.R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4626-4632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 36Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.

This is not surprising because recently a unique receptor for SPC, known as ORG1, has been identified (50Xu Y.Z.K. Hong G. Wu W. Baudhuin L.M Xiao Y. Damron D.S. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast, others have previously demonstrated that SPC activates endogenous Gi in HEK293 cells heterologously expressing EDG-1 (30Windh R.T. Lee M.J. Hla T. An S. Barr A.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27351-27358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and induces Ca2+mobilization in CHO cells transfected with EDG-5 (23Gonda K. Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yatomi Y. Okazaki H. Sakurai T. Kimura S. Sillard R. Harii K. Takuwa Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Taken together, the binding data presented here establish that EDG-8 is a specific S1P and dihydro-S1P receptor.EDG-8 resembles EDG-1 by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase via a PTX-sensitive mechanism in CHO cells, implicating Gi/Go proteins in the signaling process. [35S]GTPγS binding assays corroborate the coupling of EDG-8 with Gi. Interestingly, LPA at a relatively high concentration (1 μm) was able to weakly inhibit cAMP formation in CHO cells expressing EDG-8. The ability of LPA to weakly inhibit cAMP formation but not displace [32P]S1P binding in EDG-8-transfected cells (present study) is reminiscent of findings that LPA does not displace [32P]S1P binding in EDG-1-transfected cells but promotes ERK1/2 activation (51Lee M.J. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Thompson B.D. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22105-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that EDG-1 contains distinct sites for S1P and LPA (51Lee M.J. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Thompson B.D. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22105-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our data with EDG-8 supports a similar two-site model. However, this hypothesis awaits definitive characterization of the binding sites by site-directed mutagenesis. Notwithstanding, our displacement binding studies suggest that EDG-8 is not an LPA receptor. Identical results were obtained in HEK293T cells overexpressing EDG-8 (14Im D.-S. Heise C.E. Ancellin N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), examples of GPCR-mediated repression of ERK1/2 activity have been reported (48Huang X.C. Richards E.M.

Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In cultured neurons, AT1 receptors activate ERK1/2, whereas AT2receptors inhibit serum-activated ERK1/2 (48Huang X.C. Richards E.M. Sumners C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15635-15641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Considering that the MAP kinases are important in growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (52Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that the antagonistic modulation of ERK activity by different receptors within the same gene family acts as a molecular counterbalance system (48Huang X.C. Richards E.M. Sumners C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15635-15641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Hence, the ability of EDG-1, -3, and -5 to stimulate ERK1/2 activity and EDG-8 to repress it parallels the AT1/AT2 receptor system. The finding that expression of EDG-8 but not EDG-1 or EDG-3 in PC12 cells is chronically down-regulated by growth factors (6Glickman M. Malek R.L. Kwitek-Black A.E. Jacob H.J. Lee N.H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) provides a potential mechanism for fine tuning this counterbalance system. Such a scenario has been demonstrated in the AT receptor family, where AT2 receptor expression is up-regulated following cellular injury to antagonize AT1 signaling (53Horiuchi M. Lehtonen J.Y. Daviet L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 391-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The exact physiological role of ERK inhibition by GPCRs remains to be elucidated. EDG-1, -3, and -5 have been demonstrated to mediate PTX-sensitive cell proliferation (28Goodemote K.A. Mattie M.E. Berger A. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Kuwabara A. Kanda T. Kobayashi I. Ohta H. Ui M. Okajima F. Biochem. J. 2000; 384: 71-79Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, in endothelial cells, growth factor- and S1P-induced DNA synthesis and ERK activation are inhibited by PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK signaling (27Kimura T. Watanabe T. Sato K. Kon J.

These observations suggest that the binding of S1P to EDG-8 might negatively regulate cellular proliferation by reducing ERK1/2 activity via a protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Analogously, AT1 receptors promote cell proliferation and ERK activation, whereas AT2receptors exert antiproliferative effects and suppress ERK activation (48Huang X.C. Richards E.M. Sumners C. J.

Physiol. 1998; 275: 906-916PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type, the protein phosphatases SHP-1, PP2A, and MKP-1 have each been implicated in inhibition of ERK1/2 activity. The decrease in ERK1/2 activity by AT2 receptors in cultured neurons occurs through a PTX- and okadaic acid-sensitive pathway, implicating the involvement of PP2A (48Huang X.C. Richards E.M. Sumners C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15635-15641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, AT2 receptors act through a PTX-insensitive and orthovanadate-sensitive pathway, suggesting the involvement of SHP-1 (49Bedecs K. Elbaz N. Sutren M. Masson M. Susini C. Strosberg A.D. Nahmias C. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Inhibition of ERK1/2 activity by S1P in CHO cells overexpressing EDG-8 was PTX-insensitive, orthovanadate-sensitive, and only weakly inhibited by okadaic acid. Future studies are warranted to define the exact nature of the phosphatase involved in EDG-8-mediated inhibition of the ERKs.To determine whether potential inhibitory effects on ERK1/2 activity by activation of EDG-1, -3, or -5 might be masked by the interactions of these receptors with Gi (resulting in ERK1/2 activation), we treated CHO cells with PTX. Regardless of which EDG receptor was expressed, PTX treatment did not facilitate S1P-mediated repression of serum-activated ERK1/2. These findings were not totally unexpected because EDG-1 appears to couple only to Gi (30Windh R.T. Lee M.J. Hla T. An S. Barr A.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

The cortical cytoskeleton plays a role in phenomenon such as cellular morphology, membrane domain specialization, and cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions (1Hitt A.L. Luna E.J. Curr. Opin.

A major portion of the cortical cytoskeleton is made up actin filaments whose physiological state is governed by actin-binding proteins.

Further discovery and characterization of cortical actin-binding proteins will be important in elucidating the in vivo roles that the eukaryotic cell cortex and its binding partners play within the cell.Annexin II is a member of the annexin family of proteins that are well characterized by their ability to bind to acidic phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner (18Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149–150: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In addition to their phospholipid binding activity, most family members discovered to date bind F-actin in a Ca2+-dependent manner (19Khanna N.C. Helwig E.D. Ikebuchi N.W. Fitzpatrick S. Bajwa R. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4852-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Annexin II is unique among the annexins in that it exists as both a monomer and a tetramer within the cell. Annexin II tetramer (AIIt) consists of two copies of annexin II bound to a dimer of p11, a member of the S-100 family of Ca2+-binding proteins. Within the cell, it has been established that annexin II is localized throughout the cell, whereas AIIt is localized to the plasma membrane-actin cytoskeleton interface (20Sagot I. Regnouf F. Henry J.P. Pradel L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Harder T. Thiel C. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1109-1117PubMed Google Scholar, 22Glenney J.R.J.

It has been suggested that intracellular AIIt acts as a link between the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane, although the physiological consequences of this proposed interaction are unknown (24Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar).Although both annexin II and AIIt bind F-actin in vitro, only AIIt bundles F-actin (25Ikebuchi N.W. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3392-3400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bundling of F-actin by AIIt was rapid and reversible (t 0.5 = 6 s) and of moderate affinity (apparent K d (AIIt) of 0.18 μm). This process was dependent on the presence of Ca2+, with half-maximal values obtained near 2 μm Ca2+. The region of annexin II that contributes to the bundling activity of AIIt bundling activity was a region of α-helix in the fourth domain of annexin II that exhibited homology to an actin-binding site of myosin (26Jones P.G. Moore G.J. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13993-13997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this region of annexin II was critical for the F-actin bundling activity of AIIt, it did not participate in F-actin binding. In contrast to the F-actin bundling domain of AIIt, the F-actin binding domain of annexin II has remained elusive.Here we present evidence establishing that the C terminus of the annexin II subunit of AIIt comprises an F-actin binding domain. Interestingly, the last 9 amino acid residues of the C terminus of the annexin II subunit appear to be entirely responsible for the F-actin binding activity of AIIt.DISCUSSIONAnnexin II tetramer (AIIt) is a multifunctional protein that interacts in a Ca2+-dependent manner with anionic phospholipids, F-actin, and heparin (18Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149–150: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Due to its ability to bind simultaneously to actin and acidic phospholipids, it is thought to act within cells as a membrane-cytoskeleton linking protein (24Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It is well established that the annexin II subunit of the protein complex houses the binding sites for the aforementioned ligands, as well as the sites for Ca2+ coordination (18Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149–150: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, the exact location of the F-actin-binding sites within the protein has remained elusive. The similarity in function between the ERM proteins and AIIt, and the presence of the F-actin binding domain within the C terminus of the ERM proteins, led us to suspect that the C-terminal region of the annexin II subunit of AIIt might be involved in F-actin binding. It is known that the N terminus of annexin II is responsible for binding of p11 (23Zokas L. Glenney J.R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2111-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 46Glenney J.R.J. Tack B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1986; 261: 10485-10488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however, a role has not been attributed to the C-terminal region of the protein. Therefore, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to truncate the C terminus of annexin II to assess its possible function in F-actin binding.We initially observed that truncation of the last 16 amino acid residues of the C terminus of the annexin II subunit of AIIt inhibited the F-actin bundling activity of the protein by about 90%. This led us to suspect that the C terminus was involved in the interaction with F-actin. We then examined the F-actin binding activity of the isolated annexin II subunit. Analysis of the F-actin binding properties of several C-terminal truncations of annexin II revealed that removal of 16 or even as few as 9 amino acid residues also inhibited the F-actin binding activity of the protein. Furthermore, the truncations in the C terminus of annexin II had no effect on the interaction of annexin II with phospholipid vesicles or heparin. The C-terminally truncated annexin II mutant proteins bound to and aggregated acidic phospholipid vesicles in a Ca2+-dependent manner with a similar affinity and capacity as WT annexin II. Furthermore, mutant annexin II bound to a heparin-Sepharose affinity column in a similar manner as WT annexin II (data not shown). Finally, to determine whether the annexin II monomer behaved similarly to annexin II that was complexed with p11, we assessed the ability of the AIIt, composed of wild-type p11 subunits and C-terminally truncated annexin II subunits to bundle F-actin filaments. Clearly, AIIt composed of wild-type p11 subunits and C-terminally truncated annexin II subunits was unable to bundle F-actin. Further investigation revealed that the loss in F-actin bundling was due to a decrease in the binding of the mutant AIIt to F-actin.Our results therefore identify for the first time that the C-terminal sequence of the annexin II subunit of AIIt, LLYLCGGDD, contains an F-actin binding domain of AIIt. The localization of the F-actin binding domain to the C-terminal 9 amino acid residues of annexin II represents one of the smallest F-actin binding domains discovered to date. Thymosin β4 also contains a relatively small actin-binding site. In this protein, a region comprising the first 12 amino acid residues of the protein forms the actin-binding site (48Feinberg J. Heitz F. Benyamin Y. Roustan C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 49Van Troys M. Dewitte D. Goethals M. Carlier M.F. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, thymosin β4 is a well-characterized G-actin-sequestering protein, with only a weak affinity for F-actin (50Carlier M.F. Didry D. Erk I. Lepault J. Van Troys M.L. Vandekerckhove J. Perelroizen I. Yin H. Doi Y. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9231-9239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 51Devineni N. Minamide L.S. Niu M. Safer D. Verma R.

Known F-actin binding domains, however, are quite variable in length, with no consensus sequence length among them. For example, the F-actin-binding sites of the ERM proteins vary from 22 to 34 amino acids (14Mackay D.J. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 38Turunen O. Wahlstrom T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). As well, an F-actin binding domain recently localized in myosin light-chain kinase spans amino acid residues 2–42 of the protein (53Gallagher P.J. Stull J.T. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 173: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Even in light of the above examples, most F-actin-binding sites encompass substantially larger portions of the protein. For example, the F-actin-binding site of vinculin is 123 amino acid residues in length (35Menkel A.R. Kroemker M. Bubeck P. Ronsiek M. Nikolai G. Jockusch B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, the three identified F-actin-binding sites within the D. discoideum 34-kDa F-actin-bundling protein vary in length from 16 to 123 amino acid residues in length, although the 16-amino acid residue domain has only weak binding to F-actin (34Lim R.W. Furukawa R. Eagle S. Cartwright R.C. Fechheimer M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 800-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Although the overall length of the F-actin-binding site of annexin II is relatively small compared with known sites, other requirements for F-actin binding within this site appear to be met. For example, the structural requirements of prototypical F-actin-binding sites are fulfilled when discussing the C terminus of annexin II. It is known that the majority of F-actin-binding sites consist mostly of an α-helical structure (8Pollard T.D. Almo S. Quirk S. Vinson V. Lattman E.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 207-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the region of annexin II that we propose contains the F-actin-binding site known to be comprised of mainly α-helical secondary structure (54Burger A. Berendes R. Liemann S. Benz J. Hofmann A. Gottig P. Huber R. Gerke V. Thiel C. Romisch J. Weber K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).We expected that a peptide to the C-terminal 16 amino acid residues of annexin II would inhibit the binding of annexin II or AIIt to F-actin. However we found that the peptide to the C-terminal 16 amino acid residues of annexin II was unable to inhibit F-actin binding by either annexin II or AIIt (data not shown). We therefore examined the possibility that this peptide was conformationally distinct to the C-terminal region of annexin II. It was very likely that this peptide was not in the same conformation as the C-terminal region of annexin II, because circular dichroism spectra of this peptide revealed a large portion of random coil structure, with very little α-helical structure (data not shown).The inability of a peptide to the C-terminal 16 amino acids of annexin II to directly bind to F-actin presents two possibilities. First, it is possible that the C-terminal 9 amino acid residues of annexin II may only be part of the F-actin-binding site and other amino acids residues, contributed by distinct regions of annexin II, may participate in assembly of the intact site. Second, although the C-terminal region of annexin II binds F-actin, it is possible that the C terminus requires interaction with other amino acids residues to stabilize a conformation that allows these C-terminal amino acid residues to bind F-actin. Although speculative, it is reasonable to suspect that the peptide was unable to assume the expected α-helical structure, because it required the presence of amino acid residues from other regions of annexin II to stabilize its α-helical structure.It was also interesting that the C-terminal truncations of annexin II most dramatically affected the F-actin binding activity of AIIt compared with the monomeric annexin II. This was an important observation, because it is AIIt and not annexin II that has been localized to the subcortical F-actin cytoskeleton. Thus, the binding of the p11 subunit to annexin II may place the C-terminal region of annexin II in a conformation that allows the 9 amino acid residues to more autonomously form the F-actin-binding site. In other words, it is possible that the proposed requirement for distal amino acids to stabilize the interaction of the 9 C-terminal amino acid residues with F-actin is minimized by the binding of p11 to annexin II.The data obtained from x-ray crystallography is consistent with our localization of the F-actin-binding site of annexin II to the C terminus. It is known that annexin II has an overall curved, planar shape with opposing concave and convex surfaces. The convex side of the molecule is thought to face the plasma membrane and is known to contain the Ca2+-binding sites and presumably the phospholipid binding domains (54Burger A. Berendes R. Liemann S. Benz J. Hofmann A. Gottig P. Huber R. Gerke V. Thiel C. Romisch J. Weber K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The concave face of the protein is postulated to face the cytosol and contains both the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein. It is well established that the N terminus interacts with p11 to form AIIt, and the fact that the C terminus also faces the cytosol places it in an ideal proximity to interact with the actin cytoskeleton within the cell. Thus, if AIIt is fulfilling its proposed role as a membrane-cytoskeletal linker, the C-terminal domain of annexin II appears to be in the correct orientation to bind to and potentially modulate the actin cytoskeleton. The cortical region of eukaryotic cells is made up of the plasma membrane and the underlying protein meshwork of the cytoskeleton. The cortical cytoskeleton plays a role in phenomenon such as cellular morphology, membrane domain specialization, and cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions (1Hitt A.L. Luna E.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 2Luna E.J. Hitt A.L. Science. 1992; 258: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In addition, the cortical cytoskeleton is involved in signal transduction events that regulate membrane trafficking, cell migration, and growth regulation (3Yin H.L. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32529-32530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Aspenstrom P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Keely P.J.

Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 285-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A major portion of the cortical cytoskeleton is made up actin filaments whose physiological state is governed by actin-binding proteins. These actin-binding proteins control actin filament polymerization, filament-filament interaction, and filament-plasma membrane interaction (reviewed in Ref. 8Pollard T.D. Almo S. Quirk S. Vinson V. Lattman E.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 207-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The proteins that link the actin cytoskeleton with the plasma membrane are particularly diverse in their actions. An example is the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)1family of proteins (9Bretscher A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). These proteins are known to be involved in cytoskeletal-membrane events such as cell adhesion (10Hiscox S. Jiang W.G.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7300-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Further discovery and characterization of cortical actin-binding proteins will be important in elucidating the in vivo roles that the eukaryotic cell cortex and its binding partners play within the cell. Annexin II is a member of the annexin family of proteins that are well characterized by their ability to bind to acidic phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner (18Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149–150: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In addition to their phospholipid binding activity, most family members discovered to date bind F-actin in a Ca2+-dependent manner (19Khanna N.C. Helwig E.D. Ikebuchi N.W. Fitzpatrick S. Bajwa R. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4852-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Annexin II is unique among the annexins in that it exists as both a monomer and a tetramer within the cell. Annexin II tetramer (AIIt) consists of two copies of annexin II bound to a dimer of p11, a member of the S-100 family of Ca2+-binding proteins. Within the cell, it has been established that annexin II is localized throughout the cell, whereas AIIt is localized to the plasma membrane-actin cytoskeleton interface (20Sagot I. Regnouf F. Henry J.P. Pradel L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Harder T. Thiel C. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1109-1117PubMed Google Scholar, 22Glenney J.R.J.

It has been suggested that intracellular AIIt acts as a link between the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane, although the physiological consequences of this proposed interaction are unknown (24Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Although both annexin II and AIIt bind F-actin in vitro, only AIIt bundles F-actin (25Ikebuchi N.W. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3392-3400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bundling of F-actin by AIIt was rapid and reversible (t 0.5 = 6 s) and of moderate affinity (apparent K d (AIIt) of 0.18 μm). This process was dependent on the presence of Ca2+, with half-maximal values obtained near 2 μm Ca2+. The region of annexin II that contributes to the bundling activity of AIIt bundling activity was a region of α-helix in the fourth domain of annexin II that exhibited homology to an actin-binding site of myosin (26Jones P.G. Moore G.J. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13993-13997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this region of annexin II was critical for the F-actin bundling activity of AIIt, it did not participate in F-actin binding. In contrast to the F-actin bundling domain of AIIt, the F-actin binding domain of annexin II has remained elusive. Here we present evidence establishing that the C terminus of the annexin II subunit of AIIt comprises an F-actin binding domain. Interestingly, the last 9 amino acid residues of the C terminus of the annexin II subunit appear to be entirely responsible for the F-actin binding activity of AIIt. DISCUSSIONAnnexin II tetramer (AIIt) is a multifunctional protein that interacts in a Ca2+-dependent manner with anionic phospholipids, F-actin, and heparin (18Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149–150: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Due to its ability to bind simultaneously to actin and acidic phospholipids, it is thought to act within cells as a membrane-cytoskeleton linking protein (24Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It is well established that the annexin II subunit of the protein complex houses the binding sites for the aforementioned ligands, as well as the sites for Ca2+ coordination (18Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149–150: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, the exact location of the F-actin-binding sites within the protein has remained elusive. The similarity in function between the ERM proteins and AIIt, and the presence of the F-actin binding domain within the C terminus of the ERM proteins, led us to suspect that the C-terminal region of the annexin II subunit of AIIt might be involved in F-actin binding. It is known that the N terminus of annexin II is responsible for binding of p11 (23Zokas L. Glenney J.R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2111-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 46Glenney J.R.J. Tack B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7884-7888Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 47Glenney J.R.J. Boudreau M. Galyean R. Hunter T. Tack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10485-10488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however, a role has not been attributed to the C-terminal region of the protein. Therefore, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to truncate the C terminus of annexin II to assess its possible function in F-actin binding.We initially observed that truncation of the last 16 amino acid residues of the C terminus of the annexin II subunit of AIIt inhibited the F-actin bundling activity of the protein by about 90%. This led us to suspect that the C terminus was involved in the interaction with F-actin. We then examined the F-actin binding activity of the isolated annexin II subunit. Analysis of the F-actin binding properties of several C-terminal truncations of annexin II revealed that removal of 16 or even as few as 9 amino acid residues also inhibited the F-actin binding activity of the protein. Furthermore, the truncations in the C terminus of annexin II had no effect on the interaction of annexin II with phospholipid vesicles or heparin. The C-terminally truncated annexin II mutant proteins bound to and aggregated acidic phospholipid vesicles in a Ca2+-dependent manner with a similar affinity and capacity as WT annexin II. Furthermore, mutant annexin II bound to a heparin-Sepharose affinity column in a similar manner as WT annexin II (data not shown). Finally, to determine whether the annexin II monomer behaved similarly to annexin II that was complexed with p11, we assessed the ability of the AIIt, composed of wild-type p11 subunits and C-terminally truncated annexin II subunits to bundle F-actin filaments. Clearly, AIIt composed of wild-type p11 subunits and C-terminally truncated annexin II subunits was unable to bundle F-actin. Further investigation revealed that the loss in F-actin bundling was due to a decrease in the binding of the mutant AIIt to F-actin.Our results therefore identify for the first time that the C-terminal sequence of the annexin II subunit of AIIt, LLYLCGGDD, contains an F-actin binding domain of AIIt. The localization of the F-actin binding domain to the C-terminal 9 amino acid residues of annexin II represents one of the smallest F-actin binding domains discovered to date. Thymosin β4 also contains a relatively small actin-binding site. In this protein, a region comprising the first 12 amino acid residues of the protein forms the actin-binding site (48Feinberg J. Heitz F. Benyamin Y. Roustan C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 49Van Troys M. Dewitte D. Goethals M. Carlier M.F. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, thymosin β4 is a well-characterized G-actin-sequestering protein, with only a weak affinity for F-actin (50Carlier M.F. Didry D. Erk I. Lepault J. Van Troys M.L. Vandekerckhove J. Perelroizen I. Yin H. Doi Y. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9231-9239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 51Devineni N. Minamide L.S. Niu M. Safer D. Verma R.

Known F-actin binding domains, however, are quite variable in length, with no consensus sequence length among them. For example, the F-actin-binding sites of the ERM proteins vary from 22 to 34 amino acids (14Mackay D.J. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 38Turunen O. Wahlstrom T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). As well, an F-actin binding domain recently localized in myosin light-chain kinase spans amino acid residues 2–42 of the protein (53Gallagher P.J. Stull J.T. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 173: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Even in light of the above examples, most F-actin-binding sites encompass substantially larger portions of the protein. For example, the F-actin-binding site of vinculin is 123 amino acid residues in length (35Menkel A.R. Kroemker M. Bubeck P. Ronsiek M. Nikolai G. Jockusch B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, the three identified F-actin-binding sites within the D. discoideum 34-kDa F-actin-bundling protein vary in length from 16 to 123 amino acid residues in length, although the 16-amino acid residue domain has only weak binding to F-actin (34Lim R.W. Furukawa R. Eagle S. Cartwright R.C. Fechheimer M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 800-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Although the overall length of the F-actin-binding site of annexin II is relatively small compared with known sites, other requirements for F-actin binding within this site appear to be met. For example, the structural requirements of prototypical F-actin-binding sites are fulfilled when discussing the C terminus of annexin II. It is known that the majority of F-actin-binding sites consist mostly of an α-helical structure (8Pollard T.D. Almo S. Quirk S. Vinson V. Lattman E.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 207-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the region of annexin II that we propose contains the F-actin-binding site known to be comprised of mainly α-helical secondary structure (54Burger A. Berendes R. Liemann S. Benz J. Hofmann A. Gottig P. Huber R. Gerke V. Thiel C. Romisch J. Weber K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).We expected that a peptide to the C-terminal 16 amino acid residues of annexin II would inhibit the binding of annexin II or AIIt to F-actin. However we found that the peptide to the C-terminal 16 amino acid residues of annexin II was unable to inhibit F-actin binding by either annexin II or AIIt (data not shown). We therefore examined the possibility that this peptide was conformationally distinct to the C-terminal region of annexin II. It was very likely that this peptide was not in the same conformation as the C-terminal region of annexin II, because circular dichroism spectra of this peptide revealed a large portion of random coil structure, with very little α-helical structure (data not shown).The inability of a peptide to the C-terminal 16 amino acids of annexin II to directly bind to F-actin presents two possibilities. First, it is possible that the C-terminal 9 amino acid residues of annexin II may only be part of the F-actin-binding site and other amino acids residues, contributed by distinct regions of annexin II, may participate in assembly of the intact site. Second, although the C-terminal region of annexin II binds F-actin, it is possible that the C terminus requires interaction with other amino acids residues to stabilize a conformation that allows these C-terminal amino acid residues to bind F-actin. Although speculative, it is reasonable to suspect that the peptide was unable to assume the expected α-helical structure, because it required the presence of amino acid residues from other regions of annexin II to stabilize its α-helical structure.It was also interesting that the C-terminal truncations of annexin II most dramatically affected the F-actin binding activity of AIIt compared with the monomeric annexin II. This was an important observation, because it is AIIt and not annexin II that has been localized to the subcortical F-actin cytoskeleton. Thus, the binding of the p11 subunit to annexin II may place the C-terminal region of annexin II in a conformation that allows the 9 amino acid residues to more autonomously form the F-actin-binding site. In other words, it is possible that the proposed requirement for distal amino acids to stabilize the interaction of the 9 C-terminal amino acid residues with F-actin is minimized by the binding of p11 to annexin II.The data obtained from x-ray crystallography is consistent with our localization of the F-actin-binding site of annexin II to the C terminus. It is known that annexin II has an overall curved, planar shape with opposing concave and convex surfaces. The convex side of the molecule is thought to face the plasma membrane and is known to contain the Ca2+-binding sites and presumably the phospholipid binding domains (54Burger A. Berendes R.

In other words, it is possible that the proposed requirement for distal amino acids to stabilize the interaction of the 9 C-terminal amino acid residues with F-actin is minimized by the binding of p11 to annexin II. The data obtained from x-ray crystallography is consistent with our localization of the F-actin-binding site of annexin II to the C terminus. It is known that annexin II has an overall curved, planar shape with opposing concave and convex surfaces. The convex side of the molecule is thought to face the plasma membrane and is known to contain the Ca2+-binding sites and presumably the phospholipid binding domains (54Burger A. Berendes R. Liemann S. Benz J. Hofmann A. Gottig P. Huber R. Gerke V. Thiel C. Romisch J. Weber K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The concave face of the protein is postulated to face the cytosol and contains both the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein. It is well established that the N terminus interacts with p11 to form AIIt, and the fact that the C terminus also faces the cytosol places it in an ideal proximity to interact with the actin cytoskeleton within the cell. Thus, if AIIt is fulfilling its proposed role as a membrane-cytoskeletal linker, the C-terminal domain of annexin II appears to be in the correct orientation to bind to and potentially modulate the actin cytoskeleton.

https://openalex.org/W2079139843,"It is believed that the critical step in the pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies is a transition of prion protein (PrP) from an α-helical conformation, PrPC, to a β-sheet-rich form, PrPSc. Native prion protein contains a single disulfide bond linking Cys residues at positions 179 and 214. To elucidate the role of this bridge in the stability and folding of the protein, we studied the reduced form of the recombinant human PrP as well as the variant of PrP in which cysteines were replaced with alanine residues. At neutral pH, the reduced prion protein and the Cys-free mutant were insoluble and formed amorphous aggregates. However, the proteins could be refolded in a monomeric form under the conditions of mildly acidic pH. Spectroscopic experiments indicate that the monomeric Cys-free and reduced PrP have molten globule-like properties, i.e. they are characterized by compromised tertiary interactions, an increased exposure of hydrophobic surfaces, lack of cooperative unfolding transition in urea, and partial loss of native (α-helical) secondary structure. In the presence of sodium chloride, these partially unfolded proteins undergo a transition to a β-sheet-rich structure. However, this transition is invariably associated with protein oligomerization. The present data argue against the notion that reduced prion protein can exist in a stable monomeric form that is rich in β-sheet structure.

The best known animal forms of the disease are scrapie in sheep and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle. The human versions include kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome. These disorders are characterized by vacuolation of neurons, astroglyosis, and cerebral accumulation of an abnormal (scrapie-like) form of prion protein, PrPSc.1 Although the molecular mechanism of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies is controversial (4Chesebro B. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), numerous observations point to the central role of PrPSc in the pathogenesis of these disorders (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl.

PrPSc is derived from a normal (cellular) prion protein, PrPC. Human PrPC is a 209-residue glycoprotein that has two N-glycosylation sites and a disulfide bridge linking Cys residues at positions 179 and 214. PrPC is transported through the secretory pathway and ultimately anchored to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The transition between PrPC and PrPSc occurs post-translationally on the cell surface and/or in an endocytic pathway (10Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Race R.E. J.

PrPC is soluble in mild detergents and easily degradable by proteinase K, whereas PrPSc is insoluble in mild detergents and highly resistant to proteinase K digestion (7Stahl N. Prusiner S.B.

Furthermore, spectroscopic studies have revealed that the two isoforms have markedly different secondary structures; PrPC consists largely of α-helices, whereas PrPSc is rich in β-sheet structure (15Pan K.M.

Because the critical step in the pathogenesis of spongiform encephalopathies appears to be a conformational transition of PrP, there is currently great interest in understanding the biophysical properties of the prion protein.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of conformational transition(s) underlying the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc still remains unknown. In a recent study (29Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L.P. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), it was reported that, upon reduction of a single disulfide bridge, the recombinant prion protein could reversibly switch between α-helical conformation and a monomeric form rich in β-sheet structure. It was also postulated that the latter form represents a key monomeric precursor of PrPSc. The notion that a monomeric protein could exist in two profoundly different conformations is highly intriguing and has potentially far reaching implications. To obtain further insight into the molecular basis of conformational transitions in prion protein, we have undertaken detailed studies on the effect of disulfide bridge on the folding and conformational stability of the recombinant human PrP. Our data show that the removal of a disulfide bridge greatly destabilizes the native structure of the protein. In the presence of salt, the reduced or Cys-free protein is highly prone to oligomerization. However, under no experimental conditions could we observe a monomeric β-sheet-rich form of the protein. Both in the presence (28Swietnicki W. Morillas M. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and absence of a disulfide bridge, β-structure was formed only upon oligomerization of the recombinant PrP. The plasmids encoding huPrP23–231 and huPrP90–231 with an N-terminal linker containing a His6 tail and a thrombin cleavage site were described previously (25Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Proteins obtained using these plasmids contain the N-terminal extension Gly-Ser-Asp-Pro (25Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To remove the last two residues of this extension, the plasmids were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers 5′-CCGCGTGGTTCGAAGAAGCGCCCG and 5′-CGGGCGCTTCTTCGAACCACGC GG for huPrP23–231 or 5′-GCGTGGTTCGGGTCAAGGAG and 5′-CTCCTTGACCCGAACCA CGC for huPrP90–231. The C179A/C214A variant of huPrP23–231 was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the primers 5′-C TTT GTG CAC GAC GCC GTC AAT ATC AC and 5′-GT GAT ATT GAC GGC GTC GTG CAC AAA G for Cys179 → Ala replacement and 5′-GTT GAG CAG ATG GCG ATC ACC CAG TAC and 5′-GTA CTG GGT GAT CGC CAT CTG CTC AAC for Cys214 → Ala replacement. All DNA manipulations were carried out according to standard protocols (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequences of the final constructs were verified by automated sequencing at the Case Western Reserve University Molecular Biology Core Facility. The wild type huPrP23–231 and huPrP90–231 were expressed and purified as described previously (25Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The C179A/C214A variant was expressed by the same procedure. However, the tendency of the mutant protein to precipitate at neutral pH required different purification strategy. After expression in BL21(DE3) cells, the latter protein was extracted by sonication in a buffer (10 mm Tris, 100 mmK2HPO4, pH 8.0) containing 6 mGdnHCl. The protein was then applied onto a nickel-nitriloacetic acid-agarose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Weakly bound proteins were removed by washing the column with 10 mm Tris, 100 mm K2HPO4, 50 mmimidazole, pH 8.0. The mutant huPrP23–231 was then eluted in 500 mm imidazole, 6 m GdnHCl, pH 5.8. Protein was then dialyzed against a 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6, and the His tail was cleaved by 15 h of treatment at room temperature with thrombin (10 units/mg of protein). The free peptide and thrombin were removed by selective precipitation of C179A/C214A huPrP23–231 in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The pellet was dissolved in 10 mm sodium acetate containing 8m urea, pH 4.0. Finally, the purified protein was refolded by 10-fold dilution in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, followed by extensive dialysis against the same buffer. To remove the residual aggregated protein, the dialyzed sample was filtered and ultracentrifuged for 3 h at 100,000 × g. Protein concentration was determined using a molar coefficient at 276 nm of 56,650 m−1cm−1. To reduce the disulfide bond, the wild type huPrP23–231 or huPrP90–231 was unfolded with 8m urea or 6 m GdnHCl in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and treated for 15 h at room temperature with 100 mm DTT. Upon reduction, the protein was refolded by dialysis against 10 mm sodium acetate, 1 mmDTT, pH 4.0. The dialyzed sample was filtered and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 3 h. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded in a 1-mm quartz cell at a protein concentration of 0.25 mg/ml. Near-UV CD spectra were obtained using a 1-cm cell at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. To obtain equilibrium unfolding curves, huPrP23–231, Cys-free huPrP23–231 and reduced huPrP23–231 were diluted (to a final concentration of 0.024 mg/ml) in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, containing different concentration of urea. Samples were incubated for 24 h at room temperature, and the ellipticity at 222 nm was measured in a 1-cm cell by averaging the signal over 1 min. The concentration of urea was determined by refractive index measurements. All CD measurements were carried out at room temperature on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. Protein samples were diluted to a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 10 μm ANS. After 1 h of incubation in the dark, fluorescence spectra were measured on an SLM 8100 spectrofluorimeter using the excitation wavelength of 375 nm. The hydrodynamic radius of monomeric forms of PrP was measured by quasi-elastic light scattering on a DynaPro-801 molecular size detector (Protein Solutions Inc.). Data were analyzed with the software provided by the manufacturer using appropriate viscosity and refractive index corrections. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed using Bio-Sil SEC-250 column (Bio-Rad) attached to a RAININ HPLC system. The column was pre-equilibrated with 10 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 4.0, and the protein was eluted using the same buffer at the flow rate of 1 ml/min. The elution of the protein was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The disulfide bridge in the folded huPrP is buried in a hydrophobic environment (18Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 19Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Lopez Garcia F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G.

However, the bridge could be readily reduced by DTT upon unfolding of the protein in 8 m urea or 6m GdnHCl. At neutral pH, attempts to refold the reduced huPrP23–231 by rapid dilution or dialysis against the denaturant-free buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 and 8.0 or Tris HCl, pH 8.0) consistently resulted in a massive precipitation of the protein, leaving no material in a soluble form. Very similar behavior was observed for prion protein variants in which the disulfide bridge was removed by a replacement of Cys residues with alanine (C179A/C214A huPrP23–231). In contrast to the results obtained at neutral pH, dialysis refolding of the disulfide bridge-free huPrP23–231 under acidic conditions (10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0) did not lead to visible precipitation of the protein. However, upon complete removal of urea the samples were slightly turbid, indicating that at least part of the protein was self-associated. The aggregated material could be removed by ultracentrifugation for 3 h at 100,000 × g. An analysis of the remaining fraction by quasi-elastic light scattering revealed the presence of a monomeric protein with an apparent Stokes radius of ∼2.8 nm. A comparison of the latter number with the Stokes radius of 2.4 nm for the oxidized wild-type huPrP23–231 suggests that the loss of the disulfide bridge in prion protein is associated with a transition to a less compact conformation. The recovery of the protein in a monomeric form was ∼20% for the reduced huPrP23–231 and less than 10% for the Cys-free mutant. It should be noted that under present experimental conditions, freshly prepared monomeric protein was stable for at least 10 h. However, upon longer incubation at room temperature the protein had a tendency to self-associate. The behavior of the reduced and Cys-free protein contrasts with that of the disulfide bridge-containing huPrP23–231. The latter protein could be unfolded reversibly and refolded both at neutral and acidic pH. The refolded species retained native α-helical conformation and was stable as a monomer for many days or even weeks. The effect of disulfide bridge on the secondary structure of huPrP23–231 was assessed by far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy. As shown in Fig.1, the spectrum at pH 4 for the wild-type protein with an intact disulfide bridge exhibits a double minimum at 208 and 222 nm (with a mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm, Θ222, of −8000° cm2dmol−1) typical for α-helix-rich proteins (31Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). This spectrum is consistent with the structure of PrP containing α-helical C-terminal domain and largely unstructured N-terminal region (19Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Lopez Garcia F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 21Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13452-13457Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of the monomeric huPrP23–231 with reduced disulfide bridge is profoundly different; it shows a minimum at ∼204 nm, whereas the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm is reduced to −3000° cm2 dmol−1 (Fig. 1). A very similar spectrum was obtained for the Cys-free variant of huPrP23–231, although in this case Θ222 is somewhat higher (approximately −4000° cm2dmol−1). The spectral data presented above indicate that in the absence of the disulfide bridge, prion protein refolds (as a monomer) into a conformation that is characterized by a major loss of α-helix and increased proportion of an unordered structure. The perturbation of structural integrity upon removal of the disulfide bridge in huPrP is also indicated by near-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy. Near-UV CD spectra provide a very sensitive probe of a global tertiary structure of proteins (31Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, upon removal of the disulfide bridge in huPrP23–231, there is a major reduction of the CD signal in the near UV region. This spectral change most likely reflects at least a partial collapse of native tertiary interactions in the protein (31Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). However, a small part of the signal reduction could also be due to the loss of spectral contribution from the disulfide bond. The conformational properties of the reduced and Cys-free variants of huPrP23–231 were further probed using the hydrophobic dye ANS. This dye, the fluorescence of which greatly increases upon binding to hydrophobic sites, has been used widely to assess the surface hydrophobicity of proteins (32Cardamone M. Puri N.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Fig. 3shows that there is very little fluorescence of ANS in the presence of huPrP23–231 with an intact disulfide bridge. However, incubation of the dye in the presence of the reduced PrP or the Cys-free variant results in a dramatic increase in the fluorescence intensity. This indicates binding of the probe to disulfide bridge-free proteins, most likely because of an increased exposure of hydrophobic patches (32Cardamone M. Puri N.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar,33Ptitsyn O.B. Pain R.H. Semisotnov G.V. Zerovnik E. Razgulyaev O.I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The effect of the disulfide bridge on the thermodynamic stability of prion protein was studied by equilibrium unfolding in urea. As shown in Fig. 4, the unfolding curve for the oxidized wild-type huPrP23–231 at pH 4 (10 mm sodium acetate) is highly cooperative. Analysis of this curve using a two-state transition model (34Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar) yields a midpoint unfolding urea concentration of 3.7 m and a free energy difference between the native and unfolded state of ∼12 kJ/m. In contrast to the disulfide bridge-containing protein, under similar experimental conditions the reduced huPrP23–231 and the Cys-free variant unfold over a very broad range of urea concentration, showing no well defined cooperative transition. The reduced (or Cys-free) PrP monomer with the properties described above was observed only at acidic pH in a low ionic strength buffer (10 mmsodium acetate) and in the absence of NaCl. Upon addition of NaCl, there was a rapid change in the CD spectrum to one with a minimum at ∼215 nm (Fig. 5), indicating a conformational transition to a form rich in β-sheet structure (31Woody R.W.

Under the present experimental conditions, this conformational transition was very fast, precluding detailed kinetic studies. For example, at a protein concentration of 0.25 mg/ml and a NaCl concentration of 50 mm, the changes in the spectrum were complete within less than 3 min. In contrast to the reduced and Cys-free proteins, the oxidized huPrP23–231 remained α-helical even after 24 h of incubation in the presence of 50 or 100 mm NaCl. The oligomerization state of different forms of huPrP23–231 was assessed by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig.6). Under the conditions corresponding to β-sheet formation (10 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm NaCl), the reduced and Cys-free proteins consistently eluted as high molecular aggregates larger than the 600 kDa fractionation limit of the Bio-Sil SEC-250 column. The elution profile presented above was highly reproducible, and repeated experiments provided no indication for the presence of a monomeric β-sheet-rich species. This is in contrast with the behavior of the oxidized (α-helical) huPrP23–231 that, under the same buffer conditions, eluted at a time corresponding to a monomeric prion protein. Attempts to obtain size exclusion data in the absence of NaCl were unsuccessful because, under these conditions, huPrP23–231 adsorbs to Bio-Sil column and other chromatographic media tested (Superdex, Sephacryl, Superose). However, the monomeric state of the oxidized, reduced, and Cys-free forms of huPrP23–231 in the NaCl-free buffer is clearly indicated by quasi-elastic light scattering experiments as described above. Experiments similar to those described above for huPrP23–231 were also performed with the reduced human prion protein fragment 90–231. In close resemblance to the full-length protein, formation of the β-sheet structure by the reduced huPrP90–231 was invariably associated with rapid oligomerization of the protein, with no indication of the presence of a stable monomeric β-sheet rich form (data not shown for brevity). The central event in the pathogenesis of spongiform encephalopathies is a profound conformational change of the prion protein from an α-helical form, PrPC, to a β-sheet-rich form, PrPSc (1Prusiner S.B.

It is believed that the propagation of the disease can be described according to the heterodimer (template-assistance type) model (35Prusiner S.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar) or the nucleation-dependent polymerization model (36Jarrett J.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of the conformational transition and potential folding intermediates underlying the PrPC→PrPSc conversion remain unknown. Within the context of the “protein folding problem,” the fundamental question is whether the β-sheet-rich form of PrP can exist in a stable monomeric state or, as implied by the nucleation-dependent polymerization model, the above form is stable only as a high molecular weight oligomer. Recently, we demonstrated that, under appropriate solvent conditions, the recombinant human PrP undergoes a transition from α-helix to a β-sheet-rich structure (28Swietnicki W. Morillas M. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The key requirements for this conversion include acidic pH, mildly denaturing conditions, and the presence of certain ions. 2M. Morillas, D. Vanik, and W. K. Surewicz, unpublished data. The formation of β-sheet structure was associated invariably with oligomerization of prion protein into high molecular weight aggregates. A transition to an oligomeric β-sheet-rich structure was also reported in a related study with a redacted chimeric mouse-hamster PrP consisting of 106 amino acids (37Baskakov I.V. Aagaard C. Mehlhorn I. Wille H. Groth D. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2792-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Importantly, the above two studies provide no evidence for the presence of a monomeric β-sheet-rich conformer of the prion protein. A markedly different behavior was reported for prion protein with a reduced disulfide bond. According to Jackson et al. (29Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L.P. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), at neutral pH the reduced huPrP90–231 exists as a native α-helical conformer, whereas at acidic pH it adopts a monomeric form rich in a β-sheet structure. These authors also proposed that the reduction of prion protein in intracellular compartments could play a crucial role in the PrPC → PrPSc conversion. However, this hypothesis is controversial (3Horiuchi M. Caughey B. Structure. 1999; 7: R231-R240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and certain observations argue against the involvement of disulfide bond reduction in the pathogenesis of prion disease (38Turk E. Teplow D.B. Hood L.E. Prusiner S.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar,39Herrmann L.M. Caughey B. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 2457-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the biophysical properties of the disulfide bridge-free recombinant full-length human prion protein. This protein provides a valuable model for probing the role of protein folding intermediates in the PrPC → PrPScconversion. The disulfide bond in huPrP23–231 was reduced by treatment with 100 mm DTT. However, some spectroscopic experiments are not feasible in the presence of concentrated DTT. Dilution (or removal) of the reducing agent could potentially lead to a recreation of the disulfide bond. Therefore, to avoid any ambiguity, in addition to using the reduced protein, the present experiments were also performed with a huPrP23–231 variant in which the two Cys residues were replaced with alanine. Our data show that at neutral pH both the reduced PrP as well as the Cys → Ala variant form insoluble aggregates. The proteins could be recovered in a monomeric form only under the conditions of acidic pH in a NaCl-free buffer. Compared with the PrP with an intact disulfide bond, the monomeric forms of the disulfide-free variants are characterized by a major loss of secondary structure, disruption of native tertiary interactions, a greatly increased affinity for hydrophobic dyes, and a loss of cooperative unfolding transition in urea. Some of these properties are reminiscent of a flexible folding intermediate often referred to as a “molten globule” state (40Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, typical molten globules are characterized by a substantially more ordered (native-like) secondary structure than observed for the disulfide bridge-free variants of the prion protein. The finding that removal of the disulfide bridge results in partial unfolding of PrP is not surprising, because disulfide bonds are known to stabilize the folded conformation of many proteins. The contribution of a single disulfide bond to the thermodynamic stability of proteins is usually in the range of several kJ/m(41Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1999Google Scholar), although in certain cases it may be as high as 20 kJ/m (42Bonander N. Leckner J. Guo H. Karlsson B.G. Sjolin L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4511-4519PubMed Google Scholar). The above described stabilizing effect is believed to be due largely to the reduction of conformational entropy of the unfolded state (41Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1999Google Scholar). Examples of proteins that upon reduction of one or more disulfide bonds adopt molten globule-like or partially unfolded conformation include α-lactalbumin (43Ewbank J.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3694-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and papain (44Edwin F. Jagannadham M.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 68-82Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It was reported previously that at acidic pH the reduced recombinant prion protein refolds to a stable monomeric form that is rich in β-sheet structure (29Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L.P. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). However, our present results are at odds with this report. We are also not aware of any other protein that would switch from a monomeric α-helical conformation in the oxidized state to a monomeric β-sheet structure in the reduced state. The present study demonstrates that, upon addition of NaCl, the molten-globule-like (disulfide-free) form of huPrP23–231 undergoes a transition to a β-sheet-rich structure. This transition was invariably associated with protein self-association. In contrast to the previous report (29Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L.P. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), no monomeric β-sheet-rich conformer could be detected in our experiments with huPrP23–231 and huPrP90–231. The protein self-association reaction and changes in CD spectra occurred very rapidly (within the dead-time of the present experiments), suggesting that the helix → β-sheet transition is an integral part of the oligomerization process. However, the present data do not allow us to exclude the possibility that the self-association step may be preceded by the formation of a transient monomeric β-sheet rich conformer. Such a conformer would be, however, very short-lived and highly prone to aggregation. The finding that the reduced PrP at acidic pH adopts an oligomeric β-sheet structure is in line with previous observations for huPrP90–231 with an intact disulfide bond (28Swietnicki W. Morillas M. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, compared with the latter protein, the reduced form is characterized by a substantially increased propensity to form a polymeric β-sheet-rich form. In contrast to the disulfide bridge-containing PrP, the conversion of the reduced (molten globule-like) protein is triggered by salt alone and does not require denaturing agents such as guanidine HCl or urea. This suggests that destabilization or partial unfolding of the native α-helical conformation is a key factor in the conversion of PrP into a scrapie-like form. The view expressed above is consistent with recent findings that the helix → β-sheet transition of the nonreduced PrP may be modulated by changes in the concentration of urea.2"

The two predominant forms, PlGF-1 and PlGF-2 (also known as PlGF-131 and PlGF-152, respectively), differ only by the insertion of a highly basic 21-amino acid stretch at the carboxyl end of the protein. This additional basic region confers upon PlGF-2 the ability to bind to heparin (13Hauser S. Weich H.A. Growth Factors. 1993; 9: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 23Maglione D.

However, purification of PlGF-1 from overexpressing eukaryotic cells and measurement of angiogenic activity of the purified PlGF-1 in vivo in the rabbit cornea and chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays showed induction of a strong neovascularization process that was blocked by affinity-purified anti-PlGF-1 antibody. In the avascular cornea, PlGF-1 induced angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner and seemed to be at least as effective (if not more effective) as VEGF and bFGF under the same conditions and at the same concentration. PlGF-1 was shown to induce cell growth and migration of endothelial cells from bovine coronary postcapillary venules and from human umbilical veins (HUVECs). In these two in vitro assays, PlGF-1 seemed to have a comparable effect on the cultured microvascular endothelium (e.g. capillary venule endothelial cells, CVECs) to that of VEGF and bFGF. These results clearly demonstrate that PlGF-1 can induce angiogenesis in vivo and stimulate the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro (25Ziche M. Maglione D. Ribatti D. Morbidelli L. Lago C.T. Battisti M. Paoletti I. Barra A. Tucci M. Parise G. Vincenti V. Granger H.J. Viglietto G. Persico M.G. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 517-531PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of PlGF-2 it has been established that the recombinant, purified protein is able to stimulate bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC, Ref. 13Hauser S. Weich H.A. Growth Factors. 1993; 9: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and HUVECs but not the ECs from hepatic sinusoids (26Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Aonuma M. Shibuya M. Cell Growth and Differ. 1996; 7: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar).The VEGF homodimer binds to and induces autophosphorylation of two distinct kinase receptors: the fms-like tyrosine kinase, Flt-1 (also known as VEGFR-1) and the kinase insert domain-containing receptor/fetal liver kinase, KDR/Flk-1 (also known as VEGFR-2). Conversely, the PlGF-1 and -2 homodimer bind only to the Flt-1 receptor (22Cao Y.H. Chen H. Zhou L. Chiang M.K. Anand-Apte B. Weatherbee J.A. Wang Y.D. Fang F.Y. Flanagan J.G. Tsang M.L.S. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Likewise, VEGF-B also binds selectively to Flt-1 and hence appears to be a closer homolog of PlGF in its receptor-binding profile (29Olofsson B. Korpelainen E. Pepper M.S. Mandriota S.J. Aase K.

The extracellular portion of both receptors consists of seven immunoglobulin (IgG)-like domains, and the receptors share 44% amino acid sequence homology. The IgG-like domain 2 of the Flt-1 receptor is responsible for the binding specificity of PlGF-1 and -2 (30Davis-Smyth T. Chen H. Park J. Presta L.G. Ferrara N.

Ribatti D. Morbidelli L. Lago C.T. Battisti M. Paoletti I. Barra A. Tucci M. Parise G. Vincenti V. Granger H.J. Viglietto G. Persico M.G. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 517-531PubMed Google Scholar) (discussed above), raise the question of whether PlGF induces Flt-1 directly to transduce mitogenic and chemotactic signals inside the cell or whether PlGF acts indirectly through a mechanism of decoy, as previously proposed by Park et al. (14Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The recent observation that Flt-1 is able to mediate signaling in HUVECs in response to both PlGF and VEGF, leading to distinct biological responses, suggests that Flt-1 does not act as a decoy receptor but is indeed able to signal intracellularly (35Clauss M. Weich H. Breier G. Knies U. Rockl W. Waltenberger J. Risau W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17629-17634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PlGF translation by antisense mRNA in the human dermal microvascular endothelial cells in culture results in the inhibition of cell proliferation under hypoxic conditions (36Yonekura H. Sakurai S. Liu X. Migita H. Wang H. Yamagishi S. Nomura M. Abedin M.J. Unoki H. Yamamoto Y. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35172-35178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These new findings assign a role to PlGF in the direct control of endothelial cell proliferation, probably competing with VEGF for binding to Flt-1 and thereby forcing the binding of VEGF to the KDR/Flk-1 and activating cell proliferation. In addition, both PlGF and VEGF are able to induce migration of 39% and 51% of monocytes, respectively, through activation of Flt-1 (35Clauss M. Weich H. Breier G. Knies U. Rockl W. Waltenberger J.

Structure. 1997; 5: 1325-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This suggests that PlGF may induce EC migration and proliferation through activation of Flt-1, although the existence of a yet unknown PlGF receptor cannot be ruled out.A considerable amount of structural information is now available for VEGF (VEGF-A). Muller et al. (38Muller Y.A. Li B. Christinger H.W. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. de Vos A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7192-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 39Muller Y.A. Christinger H.W. Keyt B.A. de Vos A.M.

Also, Wiesmann et al. (40Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) have reported the crystal structure of VEGF in complex with domain 2 of Flt-1 (Flt-1D2). To understand the specific molecular details of the receptor binding site and critical components of the homodimer, which will consequently help in understanding the differences in specificity and cross-reactivity among the VEGF homologs, we have embarked on a three-dimensional structural study of PlGF. Here we report the crystal structure of PlGF-1 at 2.0 Å resolution. As anticipated, the structure is similar to that of VEGF. However, it shows subtle differences in molecular interactions at the receptor recognition site that appear to be relevant to signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and PurificationBy polymerase chain reaction, the region of the human PlGF-1 gene coding for the mature protein was cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector as described previously (11Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G. Delli-Bovi P. Persico M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9267-9271Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The recombinant vector was used to transform a DE3 Escherichia coli strain, and the synthesis of PlGF-1 was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-2-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After preparation and refolding of the inclusion bodies, the PlGF-1 protein was purified first by anion exchange chromatography followed by reverse phase chromatography. Final recovery of the active protein was about 140 mg per liter of initial bacterial culture. The identity of the protein was checked by various assays such as immunoblotting, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions, two-dimensional electrophoresis, reverse phase chromatography, and amino-terminal sequencing. The angiogenic activity was tested using a CAM assay (41Ribatti D. Vacca A. Roncali L. Dammacco F. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 40: 1189-1197PubMed Google Scholar); the purified bacterial-derived PlGF-1 was able to induce a strong and dose-dependent angiogenic response (42Maglione D. Battisti M. Tucci M. Il. Farmaco. 2000; 55: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).CrystallizationCrystals of recombinant PlGF-1 were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method from drops containing 8 mg/ml protein at pH 6.0 in 0.05 m MES buffer, 10 mm CaCl2 and 7.5% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) equilibrated against reservoirs containing 0.1 m MES buffer (pH 6.0), 20 mmCaCl2 and 15% (v/v) MPD. Single crystals appeared after 5–6 days at 16 °C. These crystals could be flash-frozen at 100 K using a cryoprotectant solution containing 0.1 MES buffer (pH 6.0), and 30% (v/v) MPD. The systematic absences and symmetry were consistent with the tetragonal space group P41 or P43, with unit cell dimensions a = b = 62.6 Å, and c = 84.1 Å. There was one PlGF-1 homodimer per crystallographic asymmetric unit and ∼50% of the crystal volume was occupied by solvent.Data Processing and ReductionX-ray diffraction data to 2.0 Å were collected at 100 K from a single crystal using the Synchrotron Radiation Source (station PX 9.5) at Daresbury (United Kingdom). Seventy images were collected (λ = 1.0 Å, oscillation range of 1.5°, 45 s exposure time) using a MAR-CCD detector system. Data processing was performed with the HKL package (43Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). Data reduction was carried out using the program TRUNCATE of the CCP4 suite (44Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar).

A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) using a polyalanine (homodimer) model based on the structure of VEGF at 1.93 Å resolution (PDB code2VPF, Ref. 39Muller Y.A. Christinger H.W. Keyt B.A. de Vos A.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1325-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Data in the range 15.0–3.0 Å were used for both the rotation and the translation function searches. No solution was found in space group P41. In space group P43, the best solution after FITING had a correlation coefficient of 56% and anR-factor of 51%. Rigid-body refinement with CNS version 0.9 (46Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). Procedures carried out with CNS included simulated annealing using a maximum likelihood target function, restrained individual B-factor refinement, conjugate gradient minimization, and bulk solvent correction. The behavior of theR free value (811 reflections) was monitored throughout refinement. Several rounds of refinement (using all reflections) and model building were performed until theR free for the model could not be improved any further. During the final stages of refinement, water molecules were inserted into the model at positions where peaks in the ‖F 0‖−‖F c‖ electron density maps had heights greater than 3ς and were at hydrogen bond forming distances from appropriate atoms. 2 ‖‖F 0‖−‖F c‖‖ φcalc maps were also used to verify the consistency in peaks. Water molecules with a temperature factor greater than 65 Å2 were excluded from the model and subsequent refinement. One bound MPD molecule per monomer from the crystallization medium was identified (interacting with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Thr-104 at one end and a water molecule at the other end) and was included in the final stages of the refinement. The details of refinement are presented in Table I. Map calculations were performed with CNS with the SigmaA protocol (47Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar), using all the reflections in the resolution range 40.0–2.0 Å. The program PROCHECK (48Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was used to assess the quality of the final structure. Analysis of the Ramachandran (ϕ-ψ) plot showed that all residues lie in the allowed regions. The program “O” (49Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) was used for map visualization and model building.Accession NumberFinal atomic coordinates of human PlGF-1 have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank under the accession code 1FZV.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONQuality of the StructureThe crystal structure of PlGF-1 was determined at 2.0 Å resolution. Details of the data collection and refinement statistics are shown in TableI. The protein crystallizes as a homodimer in the asymmetric unit. As in the VEGF structure (38Muller Y.A. Li B. Christinger H.W. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. de Vos A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7192-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), the first 17 amino-terminal residues of both monomers are not visible in the electron density map and were excluded from crystallographic refinement. Both monomers A and B contain residues 18–117. Also, residues Ser18, Glu51, Glu73, Asn74, and Ser94 in both molecules and residues Glu53 and Arg117 in molecule A have been modeled as alanines because of lack of sufficient density beyond Cβ atoms. The arrangement of the homodimer and the nomenclature used throughout the text are shown in Fig.1 A. The final model (homodimer) includes 1,546 non-hydrogen protein atoms, 132 water molecules, and two MPD molecules with a crystallographicR-factor (R cryst) of 21.6% in the resolution range 40.0–2.0 Å. The R free value is 24.7% with 4% of the reflections excluded from the refinement (50Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3849) Google Scholar). The mean coordinate error calculated from a plot of ln ςA versus (sinθ/λ)2 is 0.3 Å. The root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation in Cα atoms between each monomer of the pair is 0.43 Å (for 100 Cα atoms). Regions that deviate most include residues 18–19 from the amino-terminal tail, part of the loop connecting strands β3 and β4 (residues 72–73), and the carboxyl-terminal residue 117. Excluding these residues improves the r.m.s deviation to 0.17 Å (for 94 Cα atoms). Examination of the Ramachandran plot shows 91.5% of the residues in most favorable regions and no residues in disallowed regions.Figure 1Structural comparison of PlGF-1 and other members of the cysteine-knot super family.

https://openalex.org/W1974535915,"Triadin 1 is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), junctin, and calsequestrin. To better understand the role of triadin 1 in excitation-contraction coupling in the heart, we generated transgenic mice with targeted overexpression of triadin 1 to mouse atrium and ventricle, employing the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter to drive protein expression. The protein was overexpressed 5-fold in mouse ventricles, and overexpression was accompanied by cardiac hypertrophy. The levels of two other junctional SR proteins, the ryanodine receptor and junctin, were reduced by 55% and 73%, respectively, in association with triadin 1 overexpression, whereas the levels of calsequestrin, the Ca(2+)-binding protein of junctional SR, and of phospholamban and SERCA2a, Ca(2+)-handling proteins of the free SR, were unchanged. Cardiac myocytes from triadin 1-overexpressing mice exhibited depressed contractility; Ca(2+) transients decayed at a slower rate, and cell shortening and relengthening were diminished. The extent of depression of cell shortening of triadin 1-overexpressing cardiomyocytes was rate-dependent, being more depressed under low stimulation frequencies (0.5 Hz), but reaching comparable levels at higher frequencies of stimulation (5 Hz). Spontaneously beating, isolated work-performing heart preparations overexpressing triadin 1 also relaxed at a slower rate than control hearts, and failed to adapt to increased afterload appropriately. The fast time inactivation constant, tau(1), of the l-type Ca(2+) channel was prolonged in transgenic cardiomyocytes. Our results provide evidence for the coordinated regulation of junctional SR protein expression in heart independent of free SR protein expression, and furthermore suggest an important role for triadin 1 in regulating the contractile properties of the heart during excitation-contraction coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2033134651,"DNA polymerases contain active sites that are structurally superimposable and conserved in amino acid sequence. To probe the biochemical and structure-function relationship of DNA polymerases, a large library (200,000 members) of mutant Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase I (Taq pol I) was created containing random substitutions within a portion of the dNTP binding site (Motif A; amino acids 605–617), and a fraction of all selected active Taq pol I (291 out of 8000) was tested for base pairing fidelity; seven unique mutants that efficiently misincorporate bases and/or extend mismatched bases were identified and sequenced. These mutants all contain substitutions of one specific amino acid, Ile-614, which forms part of the hydrophobic pocket that binds the base and ribose portions of the incoming nucleotide. Mutant Taq pol Is containing hydrophilic substitution I614K exhibit 10-fold lower base misincorporation fidelity, as well as a high propensity to extend mispairs. In addition, these low fidelity mutants containing hydrophilic substitution for Ile-614 can bypass damaged templates that include an abasic site and vinyl chloride adduct ethenoA. During polymerase chain reaction, Taq pol I mutant I614K exhibits an error rate that is >20-fold higher relative to the wild-type enzyme and efficiently catalyzes both transition and transversion errors. These studies have generated polymerase chain reaction-proficient mutant polymerases containing substitutions within the active site that confers low base pairing fidelity and a high error rate.

Meselson M. Science. 2000; 288: 1211-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). However, in times of stress, the propensity to mutate and to rapidly create variants that can escape selection pressures facilitates survival of a small fraction of the original population (2Radman M. Matic I. Taddei F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 870: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, evolution may be characterized by periods of high fidelity DNA replication, as well as by the presence of transient mutators, which have a selective growth advantage during adverse conditions (3Mao E.F. Lane L. Lee J. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Identifying mechanisms of generating potential mutators is crucial toward understanding the dynamic processes that govern evolution, as well as toward devising effective chemotherapeutic strategies against pathogenic bacteria (4Oliver A. Canton R. Campo P. Baquero F. Blazquez J. Science. 2000; 288: 1251-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 5LeClerc J.E. Li B. Payne W.L. Cebula T.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1208-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) and cells (6Loeb L.A. Lindahl T. Genetic Instability in Cancer. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 329-342Google Scholar) that mutate at elevated rates.Cells have evolved multistep mechanisms to guarantee the exceptionally high fidelity of DNA replication that is required for the maintenance of species. The genetic sequence of organisms is maintained over prolonged evolution by the fidelity of DNA replication (7Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar), the efficiency of DNA repair processes (8Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), and the recombination-mediated lateral transfer events (9Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Quantitatively, nucleotide selection at the active site of DNA polymerases is the most significant contributor to the fidelity of DNA replication (10Kunkel T.A. Loeb L.A. Science. 1981; 213: 765-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Nucleotide selection includes correct Watson-Crick base pair formation between complementary bases; further discrimination of base selection occurs by a conformational change at the active site during each nucleotide addition step (11Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and preferential extension of the correct base pair by the addition of the next complementary nucleotide (12Perrino F.W. Preston B.D. Sandell L.L. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Together, these processes contribute ∼100,000-fold to the overall accuracy of DNA replication (one base change per 108–10 bases per generation (13Drake J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7160-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar)). Inefficient extension of mispaired bases in vivo would facilitate 3′-5′ exonuclease removal of the nascent nucleotide. Exonucleolytic (3′-5′) proofreading activity of most DNA polymerases occurs on a separate domain (alternatively, this activity could reside in a separate protein) and contributes, on average, 10-fold to the overall mutation rate (14Echols H. Lu C. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2189-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, errors in catalysis by DNA polymerases are subsequently corrected by a mismatch repair system, which contributes an additional 2–3 orders of magnitude to the overall accuracy of DNA replication (15Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6597-6600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of either mismatch repair system or polymerase 3′-5′ exonuclease function within cells leads to a mutator phenotype (16Fishel R. Lescoe M.K. Rao M.R.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Garber J.

Preston, personal communication.1B. Preston, personal communication. These studies provide direct evidence linking deficits in the fidelity of DNA synthesis with increased incidence of cancer.The structure of a DNA polymerase resembles the human right hand and contains three distinct subdomains (finger, palm, and thumb (19Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar)). High resolution crystal structures of DNA polymerase within the pol I2 family of enzymes indicate that the base of the incoming nucleotide stacks with the hydrophobic planar amino acids located in the fingers subdomain (Motif B), and the triphosphate portion is bonded through metal cations by ionic interactions with Asp-610 located in the palm subdomain (Motif A (20Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar,21Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar)). During nucleotide incorporation, DNA polymerases undergo a conformation change from open to a closed conformation, bringing the fingers subdomain in close proximity to the palm subdomain (21Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Planar hydrophobic residues of the fingers subdomain sense the binding of a properly templated incoming nucleotide, and this signal is transduced to the catalytic residues of the palm subdomain (22Patel P.H. Preston B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Among those residues that are located between the base and phosphate interacting amino acids and can participate in transducing this signal are the highly conserved DYSQIELR Motif A residues (in Taq pol I, amino acids 605–617). The nucleotides encoding these amino acids are conserved within DNA polymerase I of all prokaryotes and eubacteria sequenced (Fig. 1) (9Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The amino acids in this region are positioned to have a potentially important contribution toward DNA polymerase fidelity.The high contribution of the polymerase active site to the overall fidelity of DNA synthesis suggests that subtle alterations within the catalytic site should lead to polymerases with lower fidelity. This is especially true for polymerases lacking a 3′-5′ proofreading exonuclease activity that can excise misincorporated nucleotides. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified a conserved tyrosine located within the dNTP-binding pocket that, when substituted to nonplanar amino acids, reduce the fidelity of the polymerase by 5–10-fold, but these mutant polymerases also exhibit markedly reduced catalytic activity (23Carroll S.S. Cowart M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Joyce C.M. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D. J. Biol.

Previously, we established a library of ∼8000 different active Taq DNA polymerase mutants using random sequence mutagenesis and stringent selection protocol. Each mutant contained one or more substitutions within Motif A and maintained 10–200% of the wild-type activity. In this study, we screened 291 different mutant DNA polymerases containing substitutions within the dNTP binding site for altered polymerase fidelity. Many of the low fidelity mutants contained multiple substitutions; however, each contained a substitution at a single position. Mutants containing substitutions of one residue (Ile within the conserved DYSQIELR sequence), which can be substituted to diverse amino acids, yield an enzyme that introduces transition and transversion errors 20-fold more efficiently than the WT Taq polymerase. Alterations at the other sites did not have a significant effect on fidelity. Because this residue is conserved in structure and sequence in polymerases from prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archea (26Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 27Wang J. Sattar A.K. Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), it represents a potentially important target for the creation of mutator DNA polymerases.DISCUSSIONThe accuracy of DNA replication is crucial for maintaining genomic stability from one generation to the next (37Echols H. Biochimie (Paris). 1982; 64: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 38Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 429-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in times of crisis, it is beneficial for cells to exhibit diversity and thus mutate at higher rates. The fidelity of DNA replication is largely determined at the DNA polymerase active site, which is responsible for 5–6 orders of magnitude of the overall mutation rate of cells (11Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Thus far, the majority of the bacteria populations that mutate at high rates, which have been investigated, contain loss of specific DNA repair pathways (39Miller J.H. Mutat. Res. 1998; 409: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Studies with mutant DNA polymerases have mainly focused on analyzing the effects after the loss of 3′-5′ exonucleolytic proofreading activity. E. coli and yeast harboring DNA polymerases with loss of exonucleolytic activity exhibit a 10-fold elevated mutation rate (14Echols H. Lu C. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2189-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 40Schaaper R.M. Genetics. 1989; 121: 205-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Development of additional mutants, particularly those containing substitutions within the active site of polymerases, coupled with high resolution crystal structures, should advance our understanding of the determinants of polymerase accuracy, as well as facilitating studies of the phenotypes associated with mutated polymerases exhibiting poor fidelity. However, current structure-based site-directed mutagenesis studies have not been successful at producing mutant polymerases with WT-like activity that exhibit low fidelity.We have found, following random mutagenesis of a portion of the polymerase active site and stringent selection, a single amino acid residue (Ile-614) that, when substituted to a variety of hydrophilic amino acids, reduces the fidelity by at least 10-fold. No other amino acid within Motif A, when substituted, consistently exhibited such low base pairing fidelity. In addition, nonhydrophilic substitutions, including mutant I614M, did not alter the error rate during DNA synthesis (Table V). In reactions containing 3 nucleotides (Fig. 2), mutants containing substitutions at Ile-614 are able to misincorporate a base opposite the template position for which there is not a complementary dNTP. In addition, these mutant polymerases can also extend nascent primers containing mismatched DNA termini more efficiently than can WT Taq pol I. The ability for polymerases containing hydrophilic substitutions at position 614 to efficiently catalyze misincorporation was tested kinetically. Mutant I614K was shown to misincorporate nucleotides 10-fold more efficiently relative to WT enzyme; in addition, kinetic experiments showed that I614K mutant is also efficient at forming transversion errors by misextending pyrimidine-pyrimidine base pairs at higher rates relative to WT. These kinetic data suggest the mutant I614K Taq pol I should produce both transition and transversion errors, and WTTaq pol I and mutant 53 (I614K) should exhibit unique error spectrums following DNA replication of a specific sequence. We tested these predictions by conducting PCR amplification of a homogeneous sequence and measured the spectrum of mutations produced by mutant 53 (I614K). The results show that whereas WT Taq pol I and mutant 346 (A608D/E615D) contain very similar distribution of errors and that these errors mirror the published spectrum of WTTaq pol I (36Tindall K.R. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), mutant 53 (I614K) exhibits markedly elevated transversion errors, especially A:T → T:A and an error rate that is 20 times higher than WT Taq pol I. Interestingly, mutation spectrum of WT Taq pol I under mutagenic conditions in the presence of Mn2+ resembles that of mutant 53 (I614K) under normal conditions, although the error rate of mutant 53 is higher than that of Mn2+ catalyzed WT enzyme. 3P. H. Patel, H. Kawate, E. Adman, M. Ashbach, and L. A. Loeb, unpublished results.The fidelity of mutant Taq polymerase containing a hydrophilic substitution at Ile-614 is comparable to UmuC class of polymerase (34Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7447-7450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 35Tang M. Shen X. Frank E.G. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8919-8924Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). This class of polymerases contains members with modest DNA polymerase activity, yet these polymerases are particularly adept at bypassing template lesions (for reviews, see Refs. 41Friedberg E.C. Gerlach V.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 413-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar and 42Goodman M.F. Trends Biochem Sci. 2000; 25: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We find hydrophilic substitutions at Ile-614 result in highly active DNA polymerases that can also bypass damaged templates (abasic site and replication blocking vinyl chloride adduct ethenoA). In addition, hydrophilic substitutions at Ile-614 facilitate the incorporation of bulky fluorescent nucleotide analogs,3 and a wide variety of hydrophobic and hydrophilic substitutions at Ile-614 allow successive rNTP incorporation and synthesis of RNA (49Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40266-40272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The low fidelity, the ability to bypass template lesions, and an error spectrum that parallels incubations in the presence of manganese suggest that hydrophilic substitutions for Ile-614 should lead to a “wider” active site.Amino acid Ile-614 is located in a highly conserved DYSQIELR Motif A sequence; this Ile residue is maintained in large majority of prokaryotic pol I class of enzymes (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the Motif A nucleotide sequence is highly conserved within individual prokaryotic species of diverse genera (e.g. Thermus, Rickettsia, and Mycobacteria). High resolution x-ray crystal structure of Taq pol I complexed with DNA and an incoming nucleotide triphosphate suggests that three hydrophobic amino acids (Ile-614, Phe-667, and Tyr-671) pack near the ribose and base portions of the incoming nucleotide (Fig.5). Substitution of the homologous Tyr to a nonplanar amino acid within E. coli pol I (23Carroll S.S. Cowart M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Joyce C.M. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24485-24500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mammalian DNA pol α (43Dong Q. Copeland W.C. Wang T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24163-24174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) yields enzymes with 10-fold lower fidelity (and reduced catalytic activity). In the closed Taq pol I-DNA-ddNTP ternary form of the structure, this residue is not in contact with the nucleotide, but instead hydrogen bonds to Glu-615. In the open ternary form, this Tyr residue occupies the site of the template base, opposing the incoming nucleotide and hydrogen bonded to it. Substitutions of Phe-667 to Tyr within Taq pol I yields active enzymes capable of incorporating dideoxynucleotides (44Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6339-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In the closed form of Taq pol I, Phe-667 is >3.7 Å from the base, but in the open form, this residue packs near the ribose, the base, and the middle phosphate oxygen of the incoming nucleotide. Ile-614 packs against the ribose ring and the other free oxygen of the middle phosphate in both the closed and open forms of the Taq pol I-DNA-ddNTP ternary structure (21Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). We propose that diverse substitutions for Ile-614, and especially hydrophilic substitutions, lead to a more “open” pocket that can accommodate damaged templates, non-Watson-Crick base pairs, and diverse nucleotide analogs. This model proposes that stable stacking/packing interactions with the base and ribose rings are crucial for polymerase fidelity and is consistent with a model for nucleotide incorporation proposed for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (45Patel P.H. Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Raag R. Nanni R.G. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5351-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and other polymerases (46Goodman M.F. Fygenson K.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5Residues from Motif A in contact with incoming nucleotide. At different stages of the binding of the incoming nucleotide, Ile-614, Phe-667, and Tyr-671, and the aliphatic portion of Glu-615 contact the incoming nucleotide. Shown is the closed form of the Taq pol I-DNA-ddCTP complex, emphasizing the packing of Ile-614 (yellow). The metal ions are dark gray. Hydrophilic substitutions for Ile-614 residue result in polymerases with high DNA pol activity and can misincorporate nucleotides with a very high efficiency. Additional interactions (not shown) include triphosphate interactions with O-helix residues Lys and Arg and the interactions with Phe-667 and Tyr-671, which differ between open and closed forms of the complex. This drawing was made of salient residues from Taq pol I structure determined by Li et al. (PDB code 3ktq) (21Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G.

Substitution of Ile-614, an amino acid that is structurally conserved in all DNA polymerases, produces active DNA polymerase with very broad substrate specificity. These findings are consistent with models of adaptive evolution that 1) in times of stress, the inherent plasticity of enzyme active site facilitates the generation of beneficial mutants with altered substrate specificity, which could provide a selective advantage, and 2) following successful survival through periods of adverse conditions, WT nucleotide sequence (one that is fit and the most prevalent) can be generated through recombination-mediated lateral transfer (9Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This study suggests that other populations of mutators may contain substitutions within the polymerase catalytic site that confer low fidelity. Considering the vital role of DNA polymerases during DNA replication, repair, and recombination, it may be important to genotype tumors characterized by elevated mutation rates for polymorphic differences within the polymerase catalytic site. Prolonged survival of individual species depends on the accurate transmission of genetic material from one generation to the next (1Welch D.M. Meselson M. Science. 2000; 288: 1211-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). However, in times of stress, the propensity to mutate and to rapidly create variants that can escape selection pressures facilitates survival of a small fraction of the original population (2Radman M. Matic I. Taddei F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 870: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, evolution may be characterized by periods of high fidelity DNA replication, as well as by the presence of transient mutators, which have a selective growth advantage during adverse conditions (3Mao E.F. Lane L. Lee J. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Identifying mechanisms of generating potential mutators is crucial toward understanding the dynamic processes that govern evolution, as well as toward devising effective chemotherapeutic strategies against pathogenic bacteria (4Oliver A. Canton R. Campo P. Baquero F. Blazquez J. Science. 2000; 288: 1251-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 5LeClerc J.E. Li B. Payne W.L. Cebula T.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1208-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) and cells (6Loeb L.A. Lindahl T. Genetic Instability in Cancer. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 329-342Google Scholar) that mutate at elevated rates. Cells have evolved multistep mechanisms to guarantee the exceptionally high fidelity of DNA replication that is required for the maintenance of species. The genetic sequence of organisms is maintained over prolonged evolution by the fidelity of DNA replication (7Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar), the efficiency of DNA repair processes (8Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), and the recombination-mediated lateral transfer events (9Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Quantitatively, nucleotide selection at the active site of DNA polymerases is the most significant contributor to the fidelity of DNA replication (10Kunkel T.A. Loeb L.A. Science. 1981; 213: 765-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Nucleotide selection includes correct Watson-Crick base pair formation between complementary bases; further discrimination of base selection occurs by a conformational change at the active site during each nucleotide addition step (11Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and preferential extension of the correct base pair by the addition of the next complementary nucleotide (12Perrino F.W. Preston B.D. Sandell L.L. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Together, these processes contribute ∼100,000-fold to the overall accuracy of DNA replication (one base change per 108–10 bases per generation (13Drake J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7160-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar)). Inefficient extension of mispaired bases in vivo would facilitate 3′-5′ exonuclease removal of the nascent nucleotide. Exonucleolytic (3′-5′) proofreading activity of most DNA polymerases occurs on a separate domain (alternatively, this activity could reside in a separate protein) and contributes, on average, 10-fold to the overall mutation rate (14Echols H. Lu C. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2189-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, errors in catalysis by DNA polymerases are subsequently corrected by a mismatch repair system, which contributes an additional 2–3 orders of magnitude to the overall accuracy of DNA replication (15Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6597-6600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of either mismatch repair system or polymerase 3′-5′ exonuclease function within cells leads to a mutator phenotype (16Fishel R. Lescoe M.K. Rao M.R.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Garber J.

They are the terminal component of a three-kinase cascade that is evolutionarily conserved and whose arrangement appears to offer considerable flexibility in encompassing the diverse biological situations for which they are employed. Although multistep protein phosphorylation within mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades can dramatically influence the sensitivity of signal propagation, an investigation of the mechanism of multisite phosphorylation by a MAPK has not been reported. Here we report a kinetic examination of the phosphorylation of Thr-69 and Thr-71 of the glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein of thetrans-activation domain of activating transcription factor-2 (GST-ATF2-(1–115)) by p38 MAPKα (p38α) as a model system for the phosphorylation of ATF2 by p38α. Our experiments demonstrated that GST-ATF2-(1–115) is phosphorylated in a two-step distributive mechanism, where p38α dissociates from GST-ATF2-(1–115) after the initial phosphorylation of either Thr-69 or Thr-71. Whereas p38α showed similar specificity for Thr-71 and Thr-69 in the unphosphorylated protein, it displayed a marked difference in specificity toward the mono-phosphoisomers. Phosphorylation of Thr-71 had no significant effect on the rate of Thr-69 phosphorylation, but Thr-69 phosphorylation reduced the specificity,k cat/K M, of p38α for Thr-71 by approximately 40-fold. Computer simulation of the mechanism suggests that the activation of ATF2 by p38α in vivo is essentially Michaelian and provides insight into how the kinetics of a two-step distributive mechanism can be adapted to modulate effectively the sensitivity of a signal transduction pathway.

They are implicated in processes ranging from pheromone responses and cell wall formation in yeast to mitogenesis, apoptosis, and stress responses in mammalian cells (1Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 2Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2248) Google Scholar). They are the terminal components of a three-kinase cascade that is evolutionarily conserved and whose arrangement appears to offer considerable flexibility in encompassing the diverse biological situations for which they are employed.A MAP kinase cascade is generally composed of three protein kinases, a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), and a MAP kinase (MAPK) arranged in a linear hierarchical fashion as shown in Scheme FS1. Although there are a large number of MAPKKKs, which become activated through a variety of mechanisms, MAPKKKs are highly specific for their conjugate MAPKK, which they activate by dual phosphorylation. In turn MAPKKs activate their conjugate MAPKs, also by dual phosphorylation, whereas MAPKs, which are the least specific kinases in these modules, phosphorylate many proteins, typically at more than one site (3Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Although this simple picture is somewhat obscured by the existence of an abundance of different MAPKKKs and by the existence of MAPKK and MAPK isoforms, the three-tiered hierarchy appears to be well conserved. The kinases do not function in isolation, because protein phosphatases represent the force against which they labor to drive the steady-state concentrations of phosphorylated proteins beyond critical thresholds. There are several protein phosphatases, some such as the MAPK phosphatases are specific for certain MAPKs (4Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin.

The basic region-leucine zipper protein activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) is a substrate of p38α and other stress-activated MAPKs. It is a DNA-binding protein that forms a homodimer or heterodimer with c-Jun, binds to cyclic AMP-response elements (CREs), and stimulates CRE-dependent transcription of genes. Recently, it was also shown to be a histone acyltransferase, specific for histones H2B and H4 (31Kawasaki H. Schiltz L. Chiu R. Itakura K. Taira K. Nakatani Y. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 2000; 405: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Increases in its transcriptional activity (32van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12560-12564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) are associated with the dual phosphorylation of ATF2 on Thr-69 and Thr-71.We found that the kinetic mechanism for the dual phosphorylation of the two residues within GST-ATF2-(1–115), Thr-69 and Thr-71, occurs by a two-step mechanism where p38α dissociates from the protein after each phosphorylation event. The kinetics of this process is predicted to have important implications for the activation of ATF2 by p38αin vivo and highlights the potential that two-step distributive mechanisms have for controlling the amplitude sensitivity of signal transduction pathways.DISCUSSIONIn this study we show that the stress-activated MAPK, p38α, dually phosphorylates the transcription factor ATF2 by a two-step (double collision) distributive mechanism and not by a one-step (single collision) processive mechanism. Our observation was surprising, because the manner that substrates are recognized by MAPKs appears to be ideal to promote a processive mechanism of substrate phosphorylation. There are two possible mechanisms of dual phosphorylation that can be distinguished by the relative order of substrate binding (Scheme FS3). The upper pathway in Scheme FS3 represents a processive mechanism of phosphorylation, where the protein substratedoes not dissociate from the enzyme until after the second phosphoryl transfer, k′p, has occurred. The requirements for this mechanism are fairly stringent because nucleotide exchange, substrate repositioning, and phosphoryl transfer mustall occur faster than the dissociation of the mono-phosphorylated intermediate (S*) from the respective ternary or binary complexes. The lower pathway corresponds to the less stringent, two-step, distributive pathway, where S* dissociates from the enzyme after the first phosphorylation, k p, and then recombines before the second, k′p.MAPKs are believed to utilize substrate-docking interactions that appear to be well situated to provide a common platform for the phosphorylation of multiple residues within a substrate through a processive mechanism (3Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 43Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. Curr.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). By using a docking site to maintain contact with a substrate and then simply “sliding” the active site from one phosphorylation site to the next, an MAPK could phosphorylate several residues without dissociating fully from the substrate. The catalytic advantage of such a process, over a nonprocessive mechanism, while not expected to be large for the dual phosphorylation of a protein, could be significant within the context of a signal transduction cascade, where the efficient propagation of a signal through the cascade may be critical. 7Typically a one-step processive enzymatic mechanism will give 50% product ∼2.5-fold faster than a two-step distributive mechanism, assuming comparable rate constants for the binding and chemical steps. Interestingly, it has been proposed and also examined theoretically, although not proven experimentally, that scaffold proteins facilitate the processive phosphorylation of proteins in signal transduction cascades (45Levchenko A. Bruck J. Sternberg P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5818-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar).ATF2 contains a putative MAPK docking site that is similar to the DEJL docking sequence, (K/R)(K/R)(K/R)X (1–5)(L/I)X(L/I), found in many other MAPK substrates (3Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This DEJL-like sequence,46KHKHEMTL53, found N-terminal to the phosphorylation sites, Thr-69 and Thr-71, within the trans-activation domain of ATF2, probably interacts with Asp-313 and Asp-316 of p38α and is predicted to be a primary specificity determinant (41Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Whereas the DEJL-like domain appears to be ideally situated to promote a processive mechanism, it is clear from our data that this does not happen and that the mono-phosphorylated GST-ATF2-(1–115) dissociates from p38α with a rate constant greater than, or equal to 0.6 s−1, the magnitude of GST-ATF2-(1–115) turnover. Previous studies with p38α uncovered a dependence ofk cat, for the phosphorylation of a peptide, on viscosity and also a small thiol effect (46Chen G. Porter M.D. Bristol J.R. Fitzgibbon M.J. Pazhanisamy S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2079-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This suggests that phosphoryl transfer is not rate-limiting for the phosphorylation of a peptide substrate and that a viscosity-sensitive conformational change or a product dissociation step is rate-limiting instead. We are currently investigating the kinetic mechanism of p38α in more detail to determine the rate-limiting step for the phosphorylation of GST-ATF2-(1–115). There are several possible reasons why the mechanism of ATF2 phosphorylation by p38α is not processive. One possibility is that the putative docking interactions are not the only interactions required to form a stable p38α-ATF2 complex and that other interactions within or near the active site of p38α are also necessary. This is supported by mutagenesis experiments on p38 isoforms that showed that docking site interactions are not the only interactions that determine the specificity of the interactions between p38 isoforms and protein substrates (47Gum R.J. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). If other interactions are critical for complex formation and become disrupted after the first phosphoryl transfer, ATF2 dissociation might quickly ensue, leading to a distributive mechanism.It will be interesting to determine whether other MAPKs, which exhibit potentially tighter binding interactions, phosphorylate their substrates with a processive mechanism. There have been several reports that suggest that in some cases MAPKs can bind tightly to docking domains. For example, the binding of the MAPK ERK2 to a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein of the Ets domain transcription factor Elk-1 (GST-Elk1) immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads was shown to be strong enough to survive multiple washes by buffer (48Yang S.H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It was shown that the docking site interactions were both necessary and sufficient to maintain the ERK2-Elk-1 complex on the beads. Similar results were observed for several other MAPK/substrate interactions using a similar approach (49Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that the tight binding of MAPK-substrate complexes seen on glutathione-agarose beads are due to nonspecific binding associated with the matrix that increases the affinity of the interactions.Although p38α showed similar specificity for Thr-71 and Thr-69 in GST-ATF2-(1–115) (Fig. 2 A), it displayed a marked difference in the specificity toward the mono-phosphoisomers. This demonstrates that although local sequence is not the primary determinant of p38α specificity; it can be very important nevertheless. Cantley and co-workers (42Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) recently showed that ERK2 has a preference for a proline at the P-2 position, and therefore it is possible that phosphorylation of a threonine at this position can hinder binding of a substrate to p38α.Interestingly, many MAP kinase substrates appear to be phosphorylated, at least twice by a MAP kinase, before they become activated. Numerous examples of protein conformations regulated by single phosphorylations exist in the literature, so dual phosphorylation is not requiredper se. Why then is dual phosphorylation so common in MAPK cascades? It has been suggested that dual phosphorylation provides an added check against the inappropriate low rate activation by another protein kinase present in the cell (15Ferrell Jr., J.E. Bhatt R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This may be true for the activation of MAPK substrates, because different MAPKs, although similar in both structure and specificity, activate different proteins with different functions in vivo. Another possibility, however, is that multiple phosphorylation mechanisms (by the same enzyme) provide a simple and effective way of influencing the amplitude sensitivity of a pathway. The recent argument by Huang and Ferrell (17Huang C.Y. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar) that a two-step distributive mechanism can lead to anincrease in ultrasensitivity of a signaling pathway is compelling and could help explain the existence of the exquisite switch-like behavior of a MAPK cascade in Xenopus oocytes. Their laboratory investigated how the variable concentration of the maturation-inducing hormone progesterone, which activates the MAPKKK, Mos, is converted into a switch-like activation of MAPK. They concluded that the observed behavior is consistent with a model where at low concentrations of progesterone the MAPK remains inactive, but upon passing through a narrow concentration threshold of progesterone the MAPK becomes fully activated (50Ferrell Jr., J.E. Machleder E.M. Science. 1998; 280: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Sigmoidal stimulus-response curves are important because they provide a way of switching from off to on over a narrow range of input and provide a threshold that can filter out base-line noise.Computer simulation of our experimentally observed kinetic results (Fig. 4) shows, however, that a distributive mechanism does not necessarily result in an increase in ultrasensitivity in vivo. In fact it appears to offer the potential for considerable variation in the degree of sensitivity. We observed a 40-fold reduction in the specificity of p38α toward ATF2−71P in vitro, and we used this as the basis for our calculations. Rather than model the reaction of p38α specifically, we examined the effect of decreasing the specificity of a MAPK for one of two intermediates formed as part of a two-step distributive mechanism (Scheme FS2 A). We assumed that the intermediates were initially formed in equal amounts from the unphosphorylated substrate but that the MAPK displays a 10-fold decrease in specificity toward one of them. The decrease in specificity was predicted to lead to a 3-fold increase in the range of MAPK activation required to drive the formation of the product from 10% to 90% maximum, assuming that the phosphatase did not discriminate between the phosphorylated products (Fig. 4). This conclusion is qualitatively independent of the level of the contribution from zero-order ultrasensitivity and illustrates how the degree of activation of a system in response to a signal could be adapted by mutations that alter the kinetic parameters of activation.The kinetics of ATF2 activation by p38α suggests that a further increase in ultrasensitivity at this level of the pathway is unnecessary. It will be interesting to determine whether the activation of p38α displays “switch-like” ultrasensitivity in response to cell stresses or whether its response is more hyperbolic, where control is exerted over a wider range of stimulus. It will also be interesting to compare the activation of other p38α substrates such as the transcription factors MEF2 (51Wang X.Z. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) and CHOP (52Zhao M. New L. Kravchenko V.V. Kato Y. Gram H. di Padova F. Olson E.N. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), because in each case, activation is brought about by the phosphorylation of two sites that lie close together in primary sequence. It will also be fascinating to determine how the activation of ATF2 by the other subfamily of stress-activated MAPKs, the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinases (JNKs), compares to p38α. Differences in the specificity could reflect differences in the dependence of ATF2 activation on the activity of the two subfamilies.In summary, the dual phosphorylation of protein substrates by a two-step distributive mechanism appears to offer considerable flexibility in the control of the amplitude-sensitivity of a pathway and is likely to contribute significantly to the signal/response profiles of numerous signal transduction pathways. At one extreme a distributive mechanism of multiple phosphorylation can increase the ultrasensitivity of a pathway, as is probably the case for the activation of MAPK by MAPKK in Xenopus oocytes (17Huang C.Y. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). At the other extreme the same mechanism could help maintain a broader threshold, allowing the system to respond to a wider range of stimulus. These factors are likely to be important for the activation of a large number of enzymes and proteins regulated by MAPK cascades in eukaryotic organisms. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)1 are a family of enzymes conserved among eukaryotes that regulate cellular activities in response to numerous external signals. They are implicated in processes ranging from pheromone responses and cell wall formation in yeast to mitogenesis, apoptosis, and stress responses in mammalian cells (1Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 2Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2248) Google Scholar). They are the terminal components of a three-kinase cascade that is evolutionarily conserved and whose arrangement appears to offer considerable flexibility in encompassing the diverse biological situations for which they are employed. A MAP kinase cascade is generally composed of three protein kinases, a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), and a MAP kinase (MAPK) arranged in a linear hierarchical fashion as shown in Scheme FS1. Although there are a large number of MAPKKKs, which become activated through a variety of mechanisms, MAPKKKs are highly specific for their conjugate MAPKK, which they activate by dual phosphorylation. In turn MAPKKs activate their conjugate MAPKs, also by dual phosphorylation, whereas MAPKs, which are the least specific kinases in these modules, phosphorylate many proteins, typically at more than one site (3Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Although this simple picture is somewhat obscured by the existence of an abundance of different MAPKKKs and by the existence of MAPKK and MAPK isoforms, the three-tiered hierarchy appears to be well conserved. The kinases do not function in isolation, because protein phosphatases represent the force against which they labor to drive the steady-state concentrations of phosphorylated proteins beyond critical thresholds. There are several protein phosphatases, some such as the MAPK phosphatases are specific for certain MAPKs (4Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 5Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 6Keyse S.M. Free Radic.

Due to a gene duplication during insect evolution, Drosophila contains twoPax6 homologs, eyeless (ey) andtwin of eyeless (toy). Toy regulates an eye-specific enhancer of ey and thus acts above Ey in activating the eye developmental program (9Czerny T. Halder G. Kloter U. Souabni A. Gehring W.J. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 297-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Both these genes as well as mouse and zebrafish Pax6 induce ectopic eyes when overexpressed in the Drosophila embryo, indicating that the Pax6 proteins have not only a conserved structure but also a conserved function (9Czerny T.

Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 1999; 126: 4213-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in Pax6 cause the small eye phenotype in mice and aniridia and Peters anomaly in humans (13Glaser T.

Studies of transgenic mice with homozygous targeted disruption of either the LIM homeodomain protein Lhx2 or the paired-type homeodomain proteins Rax/Rx and Hesx1 have revealed that, in addition to Pax6, also loss of function of these homeobox genes lead to anophthalmic (eyeless) embryos (16Dattani M.T.

Rax is, similar toPax6, expressed in the developing forebrain and neuroretina (17Furukawa T. Kozak C.A. Cepko C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3088-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 18Mathers P.H. Grinberg A. Mahon K.A. Jamrich M.

Dev. 1997; 61: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) of mouse, Xenopus, and zebrafish. There are several reported isoforms of the Pax6 protein. One of these, Pax6-5a, has a 14-amino acid insertion in the N-terminal subunit of the PD generating an altered DNA-binding specificity (21Epstein J.A. Glaser T. Cai J. Jepeal L. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). This isoform is vertebrate-specific, since it is not found in invertebrates. Several additional isoforms of Pax6 have been reported in quail and bovine retina (22Carrière C. Plaza S. Martin P. Quatannens B. Bailly M. Stehelin D. Saule S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7257-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Jaworski C. Sperbeck S. Graham C. Wistow G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One of these is a 33/32-kDa isoform that lacks the PD due to the use of an alternative start codon for translation in the sequence between the PD and the HD (22Carrière C. Plaza S. Martin P. Quatannens B. Bailly M. Stehelin D. Saule S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7257-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in C. elegans there are two transcripts of the Pax6 gene, one that encodes the full-length protein and one initiated at an internal promoter producing a transcript that does not encode the PD (24Zhang Y.H. Emmons S.W. Nature. 1995; 377: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Together with the fact that there exist natural “P3” HD binding sites in promoters of many retina genes (25Wilson D.S. Guenther B. Desplan C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1995; 82: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), this indicates that the paired-less Pax6 isoform may play an important role in vivo during development and/or in the adult organism. The paired-type HD in Pax proteins is distinguished from other HDs by having a serine in position 50 instead of a glutamine or a lysine. The paired-type HDs are able to bind cooperatively to palindromic DNA sequences of the type TAATN2–3ATTA, named P2 or P3 after the number of base pairs separating the two TAAT/ATTA palindromic core sequences (26Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The HD of Pax6 is shown to bind preferentially to P3 sites (4Czerny T. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2858-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In contrast to the cooperative DNA binding/dimerization of other HDs (e.g. Hox), which relies on sequences extrinsic to the HD, the paired class HDs can rely entirely on the 60-amino acid-long HD to achieve cooperativity upon DNA binding (26Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Given the very conserved three-dimensional globular structure of HDs (25Wilson D.S. Guenther B. Desplan C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1995; 82: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 27Billeter M. Qian Y.Q. Otting G. Muller M. Gehring W. Wuthrich K. J. Mol.

Cell. 1991; 67: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), it seems reasonable that this structure is evolutionarily conserved not only for the purpose of DNA binding but also for preserving protein-protein contacts. Hence, the PD and HD ofDrosophila Prd can bind cooperatively to DNA when present in the same or different peptides (31Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, upon binding to DNA, the PD of Prd can interact with other paired-type HDs, and the same is true for the Prd HD regarding interactions with other PDs (31Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Engrailed-1 (En-1) interacts with the PD of Pax6 and prevents DNA binding (32Plaza S. Langlois M.C. Turque N. LeCornet S. Bailly M. Begue A. Quatannens B. Dozier C. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1115-1125PubMed Google Scholar). En-1 is not dependent on binding DNA to exert this function. Pax5 is shown to function as a cell type-specific docking protein for an ETS family transcription factor at the B cell-specific mb-1 promoter (33Fitzsimmons D. Hodsdon W. Wheat W. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2198-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Recruitment of Net and Elk-1, but not SAP1a, by Pax5 defines a functional difference between closely related Ets proteins. The interactions between the Pax5 PD and the ETS domain have not been found in the absence of DNA. Nutt et al. (34Nutt S.L. Morrison A.M. Dorfler P. Rolink A. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2319-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) have recently shown that the Pax5 PD alone is sufficient for transcriptional activation from the mb-1 promoter. The PD of Pax5 also interacts with PU.1, and Pax5 represses the immunoglobulin κ 3′ light chain enhancer by targeting PU.1 function (35Maitra S. Atchison M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The retinoblastoma protein, Rb, was shown to bind the HD of Pax3 (36Wiggan O. Taniguchi-Sidle A. Hamel P.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The HD of Pax6 and the partial HD of Pax5 can bind both Rb and TBP (37Cvekl A. Kashanchi F. Brady J.N. Piatigorsky J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1343-1350PubMed Google Scholar, 38Eberhard D. Busslinger M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1716.s-11724sGoogle Scholar). Finally, the paired-like HDs of Prd and Phox1 interact with the serum response factor (39Grueneberg D.A. Natesan S. Alexandre C. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1992; 257: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Here we describe an interaction between the Pax6 protein and the paired-less Pax6 isoform, Pax6ΔPD, which enhanced the transactivation activity of Pax6 from PD-binding sites. Rax behaved similarly to Pax6ΔPD, indicating a more general function of paired-like HD interactions in modulation of transcriptional activation. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) pull-down experiments showed thatin vitro these interactions were mediated by the paired-type HD of Pax6 by a DNA-independent mechanism. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments performed using extracts from transfected cells confirmed the existence of complexes between Pax6 and Pax6ΔPD, Pax6 and Rax, and Pax6ΔPD and Rax in vivo. Deletion of the HD indicated that other parts of Pax6 also could contribute to the interaction, and the C-terminal subdomain of the PD was identified as another interacting domain, whereas the C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) by itself was unable to interact with Pax6 in GST pull-downs. Rax was also able to interact with the Pax6 PD. Interestingly, the PD also interacted with itself. We were surprised to find that HDs from various other HD proteins were also able to interact with Pax6 in GST pull-down assays, indicating a more general capability of protein-protein interactions involving the HD. Several of these HD proteins also gave superactivation of Pax6-mediated transactivation upon cotransfection. The pCI-Pax6 and pP6CON-LUC plasmids have been described previously (11Nornes S. Clarkson M. Mikkola I. Pedersen M. Bardsley A. Martinez J.P. Krauss S. Johansen T. Mech. Dev. 1998; 77: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). pCI-Pax6ΔPD was made by deleting a Nhe I fragment including the paired domain from pCI-Pax6. To construct pCI-Rax, pBSK/mouse Rax (kindly provided by C. L. Cepko) was cut with Hin dIII (made blunt) and Xho I and cloned into the Nhe I (made blunt) and Xho I sites of the pCI-neo expression plasmid (Promega). pcDNA3-HA (kindly provided by J. Moscat) contains an influenza virus hemaglutinin (HA) epitope tag inserted into theHin dIII–Eco RI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). HA-Pax6 was constructed from a PCR product of full-length zebrafishPax6.1 cDNA (primers 6.HA.5 and 6.HA.3; Table I) made blunt at the 5′-end and cut with Xba I in the 3′-end before cloning into the Eco RV and Xba I sites of pcDNA3-HA. The HA-Pax6ΔPD construct was made exactly the same way by use of the 6ΔPD.HA.5 and 6.HA.3 PCR primers (Table I). The PCR product of the coding sequence from mouse Rax cDNA was obtained using the HA-rax.5 and HA-rax.3 primers. The PCR product was cut with Eco RI and Xho I and inserted into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3-HA. The constructs of Pax6 lacking all of the homeodomain (HA-Pax6ΔHD) were made by use of specific primers containing Xho I, that would provide an open reading frame upon self-ligation (Table I). HA-Pax6 was used as a template, and primers delA and delD were used to make HA-Pax6ΔHD. In vitro mutagenesis was performed according to the instruction manual for the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), but Xho I was added during the digestion withDpn I, and the PCR fragments were self-ligated before they were transformed into bacteria. HA-Pax6ΔHD was used as a template and 6ΔPD.HA.5 and 6.HA.3 were used as primers when the HA-Pax6ΔPDΔHD was constructed by PCR and cloned into the Eco RV andXba I sites of the pcDNA3-HA vector as described above for the same primer set. The expression construct for the Pax6 HD was made using PCR with primers HA-6HD.5 and HA-6HD.3 followed by digestion with Eco RI and Xba I and insertion into theEco RI–Xba I sites of pcDNA3-HA and pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To make vectors for expression of fusions of Pax6 or Pax6ΔPD to green fluorescent protein (GFP), a 1.7-kilobase pair Sma I–Xba I fragment (GFP-Pax6) or a 1.3-kilobase pair Pml I–Xba I fragment (GFP-Pax6ΔPD) from HA-Pax6 was inserted intoSma I–Xba I-cut pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH).

About 8 × 104 HeLa cells/well in six-well tissue culture dishes were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure using from 1 to 2.8 μg of DNA (see figure legends for details). To normalize for variations in transfection efficiency, 0.05 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase expressing β-galactosidase from a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was included in each transfection. Extracts were prepared 24 h following transfection using a Dual-Light luciferase and β-galactosidase reporter gene assay system (Tropix) and analyzed in a Labsystems Luminoskan RT dual injection luminometer. Transfections were repeated with different DNA preparations. GST fusion proteins were purified fromEscherichia coli LE392 extracts using glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proteins were not eluted but were left on the beads and stored at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 (PBT). The protocol for GST pull-down assays was adapted from Nead et al. (47Nead M.A. Baglia L.A. Antinore M.J. Ludlow J.W. McCance D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2342-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). One μg of pCI-neo or pcDNA3-HA plasmids containing the genes of interest was in vitro transcribed and translated using the TNT system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol in a total volume of 50 μl. For each pull-down experiment, 10 μl of in vitro translated 35S-labeled protein was diluted in 200 μl of ice-cold NET-N (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with one protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 10 ml of buffer). GST-glutathione-agarose beads were added, and the tubes were placed on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 15–30 min and then centrifuged at 1,600 rpm for 2 min in a microcentrifuge. Following this preincubation step, the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. About 2 μg of fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were added, and the interactions were allowed to proceed at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotating wheel. Both the GST beads used for preincubation and the GST fusion protein-containing beads were washed five times with NET-N, and as much as possible of the buffer was removed after the last wash before the beads were boiled in 25 μl of 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer. The samples were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which was vacuum-dried before 35S-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography and/or by the use of a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The protocol for harvesting cells was adapted from Nead et al. (47Nead M.A. Baglia L.A. Antinore M.J. Ludlow J.W. McCance D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2342-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cells were trypsinized and washed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. They were counted in the last wash with phosphate-buffered saline and washed once with 0.5 ml of buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) containing the following protease and phosphatase inhibitors: 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm NaF, 50 μm sodium vanadate, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were resuspended in 80 μl of buffer A containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 per 107 cells, placed on ice for 10 min, vortexed briefly, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet containing the nuclei was resuspended in 28 μl of buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing the same protease and phosphatase inhibitors as buffer A. After 15 min on ice, the samples were vortexed briefly and centrifuged as described above. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube containing 140 μl of buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and 60–100 μg of nuclear extracts were used for each immunoprecipitation. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were washed twice in gel shift buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA) and saturated with bovine serum albumin in gel shift buffer for 0.5–1 h on a rotator at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice in gel shift buffer and resuspended to a 50% gel slurry in gel shift buffer containing the protease and phosphatase inhibitors mentioned above. Thereafter, 120–200 μg of nuclear extracts were preincubated with the beads for 15–20 min at 4 °C, before they were split into two portions and incubated at 4 °C with either 10 μl anti-HA hybridoma supernatant, containing the monoclonal 12CA5 antibody, per 100 μg of nuclear extracts or 4 μl of affinity-purified PC6 polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal of Pax6 (48Macdonald R.

After 2 h, 20 μl of the bovine serum albumin-saturated protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the samples were left at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed three times in gel shift buffer containing 120 mm NaCl and boiled in 25 μl of 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer. The samples were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Mighty Small, Hoefer) in a Tris-glycine buffer (25 mm Tris, 250 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS), and Western blots were performed as described below. Mighty Small (Hoefer) 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were blotted onto Hybond nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the membranes were incubated with blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibody was diluted 1:800 for the PC6 anti-Pax6 antibody or 1:50 for the 12CA5 anti-HA antibody in blocking buffer and incubated with the membrane as described above. The membrane was then washed in TBST 5–6 times during 30 min before the secondary antibody (diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer) was applied. The secondary antibody was incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Transduction Laboratories) was used for the Pax6 primary antibody, whereas anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Transduction Laboratories) was used for the HA primary antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2069805041,"We recently reported that aging is accompanied by the emergence of CD4+CD28null T cells, a functionally aberrant lymphocyte subset rarely seen in individuals younger than 40 years. Here, we directly examined whether the lack of CD28 expression is due to a defect at the level of transcriptional initiation. Molecular studies reveal that CD28 gene transcription is controlled by two sequence motifs, sites α and β. In vitro transcription assays using initiator-dependent DNA templates revealed that reversed polarity or the deletion of either motif inhibited transcription, indicating that α/β sequences constitute a composite initiator. Moreover, nuclear extracts from CD28null cells failed to activate transcription of αβ-initiator DNA templates. Transcription of such templates was, however, restored with the addition of extracts from CD28+cells. Although previously described initiator elements have been defined by a consensus sequence, the αβ-initiator has no homology to such sequence. These studies demonstrate that initiators have functions other than positioning elements for the basal transcription complex. Rather, initiators can have a direct role in regulating the expression of specific genes. The gain or loss of initiator activity can be an important determinant of cell phenotypes.

T cell receptor initiator polymerase chain reaction terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase The cellular and molecular processes underlying immune dysfunctions during normal aging are complex. The immune system undergoes a constant turnover of cells and is highly dependent on the replenishment of new precursor cells. However, de novoproduction of T cells rapidly declines with the progressive involution of the thymus with age (1George A.J.T. Ritter M.A. Immunol.

Among T cells, senescence is accompanied by a characteristic loss of CD28, predominantly among CD8+ T cells (6Posnett D.N. Sinha R. Kabak S. Russo C. J. Exp.

Interestingly, CD4+CD28null T cells have also been found in patients with chronic inflammatory syndromes, such as those seen in rheumatoid arthritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and coronary artery disease (9Martens P.

Neither the triggering of the T cell receptor (TCR)1 nor signals generated by pharmacologic agents such as phorbol ester and calcium ionophore that bypass the TCR can restore CD28 expression (8Vallejo A.N.

Because CD28 is the dominant costimulatory molecule required for T cell activation, proliferation, and effector function (14Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar), elucidation of the molecular basis for CD28 deficiency is of paramount interest. Inasmuch as CD28null T cells uniformly lack specific mRNA of all known splice variants (8Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12Namekawa T. Wagner U.G. Goronzy J.J. Weyand C.M.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 6572-6579PubMed Google Scholar), we evaluated the hypothesis that the loss of CD28 is due to a transcriptional block. In previous work, we reported that CD28 expression is controlled by two sequences, sites α and β, that are surprisingly situated immediately downstream from the TATA box (8Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins that specifically bind to sites α and β are limited to lymphoid tissue, and their expression patterns are correlated with the presence or absence of CD28 on the surfaces of T and B cells (15Vallejo A.N. Brandes J.C. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6572-6579PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, random mutations in either site can sufficiently inactivate promoter activity in reporter gene bioassays (8Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The functional relevance of these sequence motifs is further indicated by the modulation of α/β-nuclear protein binding profiles by TCR triggering and during replicative senescence, two conditions that induce down-regulation of CD28 on the T cell surface (15Vallejo A.N. Brandes J.C. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6572-6579PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that sites α and β map downstream from the TATA box (8Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) suggests that the expression of CD28 might be controlled at the level of transcriptional initiation. Although the TATA box has been traditionally considered as the assembly site of the basal transcription complex, flanking initiator (INR) sequences have been found to be critical core promoter elements (16Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 17Weis L. Reinberg D.

In TATA-containing promoters, such INRs are thought to be positioning elements that tether TATA-binding protein, ensuring the fidelity of transcription from the TATA box (20Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). INR-binding proteins may also interact with TATA-binding protein-associated factors, resulting in improved efficiency of transcription, as has been demonstrated for immunoglobulin promoters (21Buchanan K.L. Smith E.A. Dou S. Corcoran L.M. Webb C.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1247-1254PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pelletier M.R. Hatada E.N. Scholz G. Scheidereit C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3995-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the existence of distinct INR-binding proteins is not clear, several proteins have been implicated in the activity of INRs. These include general transcription factors such as transcription factor II-I (23Roy A.L. Malik S. Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1993; 365: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell.

A. 1996; 93: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and USF (29Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 30Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the present work, the role of sites α and β as INRs was evaluated. Although these sequences have no homology with the consensus INR (18Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), sites α and β coincide with the putative transcription start site (31Lee K.P. Taylor C. Petryniak B. Turka L.A. June C.H. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 344-352PubMed Google Scholar). T cell lines and clones were established from peripheral blood as described previously (8Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M.

Briefly, CD4+CD28null and CD4+CD28+ T cells were isolated from blood mononuclear cells by standard fluorescence-activated cell sorting procedures. Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 (OKT3, ATCC, Manassas, VA) and γ-irradiated autologous monocytes for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were subjected to limited dilution cloning in 96-well plates with feeder cells consisting of γ-irradiated, neuraminidase-treated EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cells without additional stimulation. Clones were isolated, and phenotypes were ascertained by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry (see below). Primary CD4+ T cell lines were derived from unfractionated blood mononuclear cells that were similarly stimulated with anti-CD3. After 24 h, CD4+ T cells were isolated by the immunodepletion of CD8+ cells using the VarioMacs system (Biotec Miltenyi, Auburn, CA). Purity of the isolated cells was verified by flow cytometry. Cells were cultured on EBV-transformed B cell feeders and 20 units/ml recombinant human interleukin 2 (Proleukin, Chiron, Emeryville, CA). Sublines of CD4+CD28+ and CD4+CD28null T cells were subsequently established by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. All lines and clones were maintained by weekly stimulation with EBV-transformed B cell feeders and recombinant human interleukin 2 in a humidified 7.5% CO2 incubator as described previously (8Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Vallejo A.N. Brandes J.C. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6572-6579PubMed Google Scholar). The T cell lymphoma lines Jurkat and HUT78 (ATCC) were maintained at densities of about 5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HUT78 was cultured in the presence of 20 units/ml recombinant human interleukin 2. Cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. T cells were examined for cell surface expression of CD3, CD4, and CD28 by three-color immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry. The lack of CD28 expression in T cell clones or lines was also verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (reverse transcription-PCR) procedures for the splice variants of CD28 (12Namekawa T. Wagner U.G. Goronzy J.J. Weyand C.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 15Vallejo A.N. Brandes J.C. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6572-6579PubMed Google Scholar). Clonality of the T cell clones was established by standard nested reverse transcription-PCR for the BV-BJ segments of the TCR. PCR products were cloned into the TA vector and recombinants were used to transform One-ShotTM Escherichia coli(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Sequencing of plasmids prepared from at least three randomly selected bacterial colonies authenticated the clones. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a high salt extraction protocol described previously (8Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 33Vallejo A.N. Pease L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29813-29821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Extracts from the primary T cell lines and clones were prepared between 3 and 5 days after the last stimulation. Extracts from Jurkat and HUT78 cells were prepared during logarithmic growth. Protein concentrations of the extracts were determined by the Bradford method using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts were aliquoted, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Sequences of the human CD28 gene sites α and β,CGTTATATCCTGTGTGAAATGCTGCAGTCAGGATGCCTTGTGGTTTGAGTGCCTTGAT(the underlined 5′ and 3′ sequences correspond to α and β, respectively) (8Vallejo A.N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) were cloned into plasmid templates (provided by Dr. Jörg Kaufmann, Chiron Corp.) containing a 180-base pair G-less cassette downstream from a consensus TATA and the INR of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) (34Kaufmann J. Verrijzer C.P. Shao J. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 873-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Kaufmann J. Ahrens K. Koop R. Smale S.T. Müller R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Sites α and β were introduced into these plasmids as separate elements or as a contiguous unit replacing TdT-INR by the gene soeing technique (36Vallejo A.N. Pogulis R.J. Pease L.R. PCR Methods Applications. 1994; 4: S123-S130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Templates containing a reversed orientation of αβ were also made. Constructs were amplified in E. coli DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) by standard transformation procedures and randomly selected bacterial colonies were screened for recombinant plasmids by PCR using primers specifically designed to detect the inserted α and/or β sequence. Where PCR amplification of αβ was indicated, plasmids were prepared by a commercially available kit (EndoFree plasmid kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and subjected to DNA sequencing of the entire the region spanning TATA, INR, and the G-less cassette. Two clones of each construct were selected for these studies. Conditions of transcription reactions were as described previously (34Kaufmann J. Verrijzer C.P. Shao J. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 873-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with the following modification. Nuclear extracts were subjected to centrifugation dialysis (Microcon YM3 Amicon filter, Millipore, Bedford, MA) against 10 volumes of reaction buffer, and the total protein concentration was determined as above. Nuclear extracts were added at the indicated amounts to 300 ng of plasmid template and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. A mixture of 100 mm ATP, 100 mm CTP, and 50 μm[α-32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, the total reaction volume was adjusted to 100 μl, and the mixture was incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. Transcription products were digested with 60 units of RNase T1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), extracted with phenol-chloroform, size-fractionated on 8% polyacrylamide-6 m urea sequencing gels, and visualized by autoradiography. Nuclear extracts used in the in vitrotranscription assays were tested for the presence of α- and β-binding factors by gel shift assays by previously described procedures (8Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Vallejo A.N. Brandes J.C. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6572-6579PubMed Google Scholar). Centrifugation dialysis of extracts (see above) did not significantly affect the α/β binding profiles of the extracts (data not shown). As in previous studies, CD28+ T cells consistently showed α- and β-specific binding proteins. Additionally, competitive gel shift assays with α, β, or TdT-INR sequences revealed exquisite specificity of binding activities among these 3 promoter motifs, as they did not cross-compete each other (data not shown). Other studies indicate similar distinctiveness of the binding activities of TdT-INR from those of other INR sequences (37Folkers G.E. van der Burg B. van der Saag P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32200-32212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although the transcription factor that directly bind TdT-INR is not known, transcriptional activation of the TATA/TdT-INR template has been shown to be dependent on CIF150, a cofactor of transcription factor IID that appears to be ubiquitously expressed (35Kaufmann J. Ahrens K. Koop R. Smale S.T. Müller R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription-PCR experiments for CIF150 expression in T cells used in the present study uniformly showed the presence of specific transcripts. Direct sequencing of PCR products (data not shown) authenticated these CIF150 transcripts. We have shown previously that two sequence motifs, sites α and β, regulate the constitutive expression of CD28 (8Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The peculiar topographic location of these sequences immediately flanking the TATA box suggested that they might directly interact with the basal transcription complex. To evaluate this hypothesis, we adapted an in vitrotranscription system (35Kaufmann J. Ahrens K. Koop R. Smale S.T. Müller R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that measures transcription of a DNA cassette controlled by a consensus TATA box and TdT-INR. As shown in Fig.1, replacement of the TdT-INR element of the DNA template by the CD28 gene αβ sequence resulted in the production of cassette transcripts in the presence of nuclear extracts from Jurkat, a T cell lymphoma that expressed high levels of CD28 (15Vallejo A.N. Brandes J.C. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6572-6579PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of αβ-dependent transcription increased with the amounts of nuclear extract added in a manner similar to those seen with templates containing the TdT-INR. Consistent with previous studies (34Kaufmann J. Verrijzer C.P. Shao J. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 873-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Kaufmann J. Ahrens K. Koop R. Smale S.T. Müller R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the mutated variant of the TdT-INR yielded levels of cassette transcripts that were consistently and significantly lower than that seen with wild-type TdT-INR. Presumably, the low amounts of transcripts seen with the mutant TdT-INR represented the basal level of transcription from the upstream canonical TATA box. Experiments were also carried out to examine whether sites α and β can function independent of each other. As shown in Fig.2, neither α nor β alone elicited transcription at levels higher than the baseline seen with templates containing the TdT-INR mutant. As in the previous experiment, the composite αβ sequence elicited high levels of transcription in the presence of Jurkat nuclear extracts in a dose-dependent manner. The amounts of αβ-driven transcripts were equivalent to those seen with the wild-type TdT-INR. In TATA-containing promoters, INRs are known to synergize with the TATA box, resulting in levels of transcription that are significantly higher than those seen with INR or TATA alone (38Emani K.H. Jain A. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3007-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This synergy is distinguished from a classical enhancer in that the latter induces transcription regardless of its orientation or distance from the basal complex assembled on the TATA box. Thus, we examined whether a reversed polarity, from α → β to β → α, affects INR activity. As shown in Fig. 3, two independent clones of DNA templates containing the reversed β → α sequence indeed yielded only low amounts of cassette transcripts. In these template constructs, the levels of transcription were equivalent to those produced by constructs containing the mutant TdT-INR. In previous studies, α/β-specific complexes were found to be uniformly lacking in CD4+CD28null T cells. Gel shift assays revealed that neither contiguous αβ (8Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) nor separate α and β (15Vallejo A.N. Brandes J.C. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6572-6579PubMed Google Scholar) probes showed protein binding activities with nuclear extracts from CD28null cells. Therefore, we examined whether this lack of DNA-protein complexes correlates with the absence of transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig. 4, in vitro transcription assays using nuclear extracts from various activated CD28+ T cells yielded cassette transcripts from DNA templates containing αβ as the INR element. The amounts of transcripts produced were equivalent to those seen with Jurkat nuclear extracts. In contrast, none of the nuclear extracts from CD28null T cells elicited transcription above basal levels. Extracts from CD28+ and CD28null T cells were, however, indistinguishable in their ability to promote transcription of templates containing the TdT-INR. As expected, templates with the mutated TdT-INR produced equivalent low/basal amounts of transcripts regardless of the CD28 phenotype of the extracts used. The lack of αβ-INR activity in CD28null T cells could be due to the absence of αβ-specific transcription factors or to the presence of an inhibitor of αβ-proteins. To address this issue, reconstitution experiments were conducted using nuclear extracts from Jurkat and HUT78 cells as prototypes of CD28+ and CD28null T cells, respectively. As shown in Fig.5, transcription of two DNA templates containing the αβ-INR was at low/basal levels with HUT78 extracts. However, the addition of increasing amounts of Jurkat extracts effectively restored αβ-mediated transcription. The reconstitution of transcriptional activity was proportional to the amounts of Jurkat extracts added to the reaction. Such mixtures of Jurkat and HUT78 extracts did not alter the levels of transcription of templates containing TdT-INR. Reciprocal experiments were also conducted wherein HUT78 extracts were added in increasing amounts to a constant amount of Jurkat extracts. As shown in Fig. 6, the addition of HUT78 extracts did not affect αβ-driven transcription in Jurkat extracts. Transcription from TdT-INR templates were also unaffected by the titration of HUT78 extracts. The observation that αβ-INR activity required α and β sequences in tandem (Fig. 2) suggested that nuclear proteins binding to both motifs are essential to transcription. Although these α/β-binding proteins remain to be identified, previous studies indicate that α- and β-complexes are distinct from each other (8Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M.

Therefore, we examined the effect of depletion of either complex in the efficiency of transcription. As shown in Fig. 7, incubation of Jurkat nuclear extracts in oligonucleotides corresponding to either site α or β resulted in the significant reduction of transcription of DNA templates containing the composite αβ sequences as INR. The levels of αβ-driven transcription were effectively reduced to basal levels at oligonucleotide concentrations of 300 fmol. Similarly, incubation of extracts in oligonucleotides containing both α and β motifs also abrogated αβ-mediated transcription. As expected, none of the α/β oligonucleotides affected transcription of templates containing the TdT-INR. The present work provides functional evidence for the direct role of sites α and β in CD28 gene transcription. Because the assay system adapted in this study stringently gauges the induction of INR-driven transcription over the basal activity of a canonical TATA box (34Kaufmann J. Verrijzer C.P. Shao J. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 873-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Kaufmann J. Ahrens K. Koop R. Smale S.T. Müller R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the ability of α and β to function as a core promoter element in a heterologous DNA template (Fig. 1) is impressive. Moreover, the lack of INR activity in similar templates with either sequence motif isolated from the other, as well as in templates with reversed polarity from an α → β to a β → α orientation (Figs. 2 and 3), provides compelling evidence that α and β constitute a singular INR. Incidentally, the sequence stretch encompassing α/β overlaps the previously described, albeit equivocated, transcriptional start site of the CD28 gene (31Lee K.P. Taylor C. Petryniak B. Turka L.A. June C.H. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 344-352PubMed Google Scholar). The present data therefore authenticate this initiation site coinciding with αβ. Its peculiar location immediately flanking and downstream of the TATA box (8Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) lends further structural definition of αβ as an INR in a manner similar to other known INRs (25Chen H.

Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), they are the nucleation sites for the basal transcriptional complex in TATA-less promoters (41Zhou Q.

This is exemplified by the expression of lymphoid-specific genes such as TdT, the CD4 antigen, and the TCR Vβ chain, all of which lack a TATA box and utilize INR to initiate transcription (45Duncan D.D.

In yeast, two enzymes, the methionyl- and glutamyl-tRNA synthetases associate in vivo with the tRNA-binding protein Arc1p. To study the assembly and function of this complex, we have reconstituted it in vitro from individually purified recombinant proteins. Our results show that Arc1p can readily bind to either or both of the two enzymes, mediating the formation of the respective binary or ternary complexes. Under competition conditions, Arc1p alone exhibits broad specificity and interacts with a defined set of tRNA species. Nevertheless, thein vitro reconstituted Arc1p-containing enzyme complexes can bind only to their cognate tRNAs and tighter than the corresponding monomeric enzymes. These results demonstrate that the organization of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases with general tRNA-binding proteins into multimeric complexes can stimulate their catalytic efficiency and, therefore, offer a significant advantage to the eukaryotic cell.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The 20 different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, one for each amino acid, can be assigned to two classes (I and II), depending on the sequence and structure of their conserved catalytic domains (3Cusack S.

The enzymes also contain additional idiosyncratic domains that are attached to or inserted in the class-defining catalytic core and are responsible for binding the cognate tRNAs (5Ibba M. Curnow A.W. Soll D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 39-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Enzymes from yeast and higher eukaryotes are further characterized in comparison to the corresponding prokaryotic enzymes by the addition of extensions to the N or C termini, which are often dispensable for activity (6Mirande M.

Higher eukaryotes indeed contain a supramolecular multienzyme complex comprised of nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and three nonenzymatic polypeptides of 43, 38, and 18 kDa called p43 (pro-EMAPII), p38, and p18, respectively (21Filonenko V.V.

It is possible that the association of the synthetases with the other components of the complex may modulate their activity, as has been shown in the case of human ArgRS, whose activity can be stimulated by the interaction with p43 (25Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We previously identified in yeast a smaller complex of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases consisting of two class I enzymes, methionyl-tRNA (MetRS)1 and glutamyl-tRNA (GluRS) synthetases, and the protein Arc1p, which is the yeast homologue of p43 (26Simos G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32573-32579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that Arc1p associates with the two enzymes of the complex through its N-terminal domain, whereas its C-terminal part harbors a tRNA binding domain (TRBD) (28Simos G. Sauer A. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The biggest part of the TRBD is conserved between yeast Arc1p and mammalian p43 and is also found fused at the C-terminal end of the catalytic domain of the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (29Kleeman T.A. Wei D. Simpson K.L. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14420-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Human TyrRS as well as p43 can be targets of proteolytic enzymes during apoptosis (30Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This results in the release of the corresponding TRBDs, which can act as EMAP II (endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide)-like cytokines, possibly linking the progression of apoptosis to the inhibition of protein translation (reviewed in Ref.34Weiner A.M. Maizels N. Science. 1999; 284: 63-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of the TRBD of p43 has been solved, showing that it adopts an OB fold, an oligonucleotide binding structural motif also found in the anticodon binding domains of class IIb aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (35Kim Y. Shin J. Li R. Cheong C. Kim K. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27062-27068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Part of the TRBD of Arc1p is also conserved in prokaryotes as a domain of two synthetases, MetRS and PheRS (26Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), or as an independent polypeptide, Trbp111 (36Morales A.J. Swairjo M.A. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3475-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Trbp111 has indeed been characterized as a structure-specific tRNA-binding protein, which may stabilize the L-shape of tRNA (36Morales A.J. Swairjo M.A. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3475-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In yeast, the presence of TRBD in Arc1p is necessary for the stimulation of the catalytic efficiency of MetRS by increasing its apparent affinity for tRNAMet (28Simos G. Sauer A. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Arc1p is required for optimal cell growth and is essential for viability in the absence of the tRNA nuclear export factor Los1p (26Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Indeed, tRNA aminoacylation has been shown to be required for efficient nuclear tRNA export in yeast (37Grosshans H. Hurt E. Simos G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 830-840PubMed Google Scholar, 38Sarkar S. Azad A.K. Hopper A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14366-14371Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular details of the function of Arc1p in tRNA aminoacylation, we attempted the in vitro reconstitution of its complex with tRNA and/or the two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Our results show that the formation of the Arc1p·MetRS·GluRS complex can occur in vitro, requiring no other factors. Furthermore, although Arc1p has a broad specificity for tRNAs, its association with the synthetases facilitates the interaction exclusively with the corresponding cognate tRNAs and leads to stimulation of aminoacylation efficiency. These data can explain why eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are organized into multimeric complexes containing additional tRNA-binding proteins of broad specificity. To overproduce eight histidine-tagged MetRS and GluRS in yeast, the vector pEMBLyex4, with the selectable markers URA3 and the poorly expressed leu2-dallele of LEU2, which increases the copy number of the plasmid under leucine-selecting conditions (39Cesareni G. Murray J.A.H. Genet. Eng. 1987; 9: 135-154Crossref Google Scholar, 40Dente L. Cesareni G. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), was modified to create vector pEMBLyex4-His8. A small DNA piece, constructed by annealing two complementary synthetic oligonucleotides, was inserted at the BamHI site at the 5′ end of the polylinker of pEMBLyex4, adding the sequence 5′- GATCGATGCACCACCACCACC ACCACCACCACCTGGAGG-3′. This codes for the start methionine followed by eight histidines and contains a XhoI restriction site at the 3′ end (underlined) to facilitate the selection of the correctly ligated constructs. Only the BamHI site at the 3′ end of the new sequence was regenerated. The ORF of MetRS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using as template plasmid pUN100-MES1 (26Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and primers that created a BamHI restriction site before the second codon and a PstI restriction site in the 3′-untranslated region of the gene. The ORF was then cloned into pEMBLyex4-His8 previously cut withBamHI/PstI, which created a coding sequence for an in-frame fusion protein of eight histidine residues joined by a spacer Leu-Glu-Gly tripeptide to the amino acid immediately after the start methionine of the original MetRS ORF (plasmid pEMBLyex4-His8-MetRS). The ORF of GluRS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using as template yeast genomic DNA and primers that created a XbaI restriction site before the second codon and a PstI restriction site in the 3′-untranslated region of the gene. The ORF was then also cloned into pEMBLyex4-His8 previously cut withXbaI/PstI, which created a coding sequence for a fusion protein containing eight histidine residues joined by a spacer Leu-Glu-Gly-Ser-Ser-Arg hexapeptide to the amino acid immediately after the start methionine of the original GluRS ORF (plasmid pEMBLyex4-His8-GluRS). The inserts containing the fusion proteins were sequenced, and no mutations could be found. Purification of recombinant epitope (His6)-tagged Arc1p and Arc1p deletion mutants or Arc1p domains from Escherichia coli and untagged full-length MetRS from an overproducing yeast strain was performed as described previously (26Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 28Simos G. Sauer A. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Mol.

Biol. 1992; 225: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The epitope-tagged His8-MetRS and His8-GluRS were purified as follows: plasmids pEMBLyex4-His8-MetRS and pEMBLyex4-His8-GluRS were transformed to haploid RS453 yeast cells. Cultures of the transformed yeast cells were grown in SDC-leu medium to anA 600 nm between 0.5 and 1. The cells were then collected by centrifugation, re-suspended in 1 liter of galactose containing SGC-leu minimal medium at anA 600 nm of 0.4, and grown for 14 h to an A 600 nm of ∼1.7. The cells were collected by centrifugation, spheroplasted with Zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Corp.), and stored at −20 °C. 2 g of frozen spheroplasts were re-suspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (LB: 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete, EDTA-free from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 mm Pefabloc (Roth) and lysed with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 27000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was applied onto a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) column (bed volume: 0.5 ml) that was then washed with lysis buffer until no more protein could be detected in the eluate. Bound proteins were then eluted by 4 ml of LB containing 250 mm imidazole, dialyzed against MonoQ buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), loaded onto a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer and, eluted with a NaCl gradient. His8-MetRS was eluted with ∼230 mmNaCl, whereas His8-GluRS was eluted with ∼130 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 °C. In all purification steps the identity of the purified protein bands was verified with Western blotting using anti-MetRS polyclonal antibodies for the detection of His8-MetRS and monoclonal antibodies against the histidine tag (BAbCO, Berkeley, CA) for the detection of His8-GluRS. Protein-protein and protein-tRNA binding reactions were performed by mixing the individual proteins, yeast tRNAPhe (Sigma) or total yeast tRNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a total volume of 150–250 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol) and incubating at 30 °C for 30 min. After the end of the incubation, the mixture was spun at 14.000 rpm on an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C, and 100–200 μl of the supernatant were loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted with binding buffer at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The fractions that exhibited detectable absorption at 280 nm were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and, when appropriate, by RNA extraction followed by electrophoresis on 10% urea-polyacrylamide denaturing gels. To calculate apparent molecular masses from the elution volumes, the column was calibrated using the gel filtration standard by Bio-Rad. The aminoacylation activity of His8-GluRS alone or in complex with Arc1p was determined as follows. 50 nm of enzyme was added to 200 μl of reaction mixture containing 144 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, 6 mg/ml total yeast tRNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 0.1 mml-[1-14C]glutamic acid (specific activity 56 mCi/mmol), and the reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C. At various time intervals 40-μl aliquots were spotted onto Whatman paper discs pre-soaked with 5% trichloroacetic acid to quench the reaction. The filters were washed three times with cold trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm glutamic acid and three times with 70% ethanol, dried, and counted for radioactivity in scintillation liquid. Protein concentrations were determined using the protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad. SDS-PAGE, DNA manipulations (restriction digests, ligations, polymerase chain reaction amplifications, etc.), RNA extraction, and Northern analysis were performed according to standard protocols. Detection of tRNAs on Northern blots was done using end-labeled synthetic DNA oligonucleotides complementary to tRNA-specific sequences. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for polymerase chain reaction or Northern are available upon request. To reconstitute and isolate Arc1p complexes with tRNA or aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, we chose to use gel filtration as a method for separating the bound from the free complex components. We first analyzed the migration of recombinant Arc1p on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. According to its amino acid sequence, Arc1p has a predicted molecular mass of 42 kDa. However, recombinant Arc1p was eluted from the column as a symmetrical peak with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa (Fig.1 A). To find out which part of Arc1p may be responsible for this aberrant migration, we analyzed individual Arc1p domains or Arc1p deletion mutants. The results show that the N- and C-terminal domains of Arc1p behaved as monomers (TableI). The Arc1-ΔM mutant, lacking the middle (M) domain, migrated with an apparent molecular mass close to the theoretical one. In contrast, the mutants Arc1-ΔN and Arc1-ΔC, both containing the M domain, displayed a much higher apparent molecular mass than predicted. Therefore, the aberrant migration of Arc1p must be due to the presence of the M domain, which may cause formation of dimers (see also “Discussion”).Table IPredicted and apparent molecular masses of Arc1p, Arc1p domains, and Arc1p-complexes, as calculated from the amino acid sequences and the elution volumes of Superdex 200Protein or complexPredicted molecular massApparent molecular masskDakDaArc1p4385Arc1-N (1–133)1-aThe numbers in parenthesis indicate the amino acids that constitute the Arc1p domains.1719.5Arc1-ΔN (123–376)1-aThe numbers in parenthesis indicate the amino acids that constitute the Arc1p domains.3065Arc1-C (199–376)1-aThe numbers in parenthesis indicate the amino acids that constitute the Arc1p domains.2224Arc1-ΔC (1–211)1-aThe numbers in parenthesis indicate the amino acids that constitute the Arc1p domains.25.555Arc1-ΔM (1–133 + 199–376)1-aThe numbers in parenthesis indicate the amino acids that constitute the Arc1p domains.36.549Arc1p + tRNAPhe6891Arc1-ΔN + tRNAPhe5590MetRS85.589.5Arc1p + MetRS128.5219Arc1-N + MetRS102.5132Arc1p + MetRS + tRNA153.5212His8-GluRS84.592Arc1p + His8-GluRS127.5210Arc1-N + His8-GluRS101.5120Arc1p + His8-GluRS + tRNA152.5200Arc1p + His8-MetRS + His8-GluRS214.5335Arc1-N + His8-MetRS + His8-GluRS188.5270Arc1p + His8-MetRS + His8-GluRS + tRNA239.53241-a The numbers in parenthesis indicate the amino acids that constitute the Arc1p domains. Open table in a new tab To isolate a stable Arc1p·tRNA complex, recombinant Arc1p was incubated with yeast tRNAPhe, and the mixture was then loaded on the Superdex 200 column. Elution revealed two peaks (Fig.1 B), as compared with one peak when tRNA was analyzed alone (Fig. 1 C). Protein and RNA electrophoresis demonstrated that the 35-kDa peak contained only tRNAPhe, whereas the 90-kDa peak contained both Arc1p and tRNAPhe. Therefore, a significant amount of tRNA was bound to Arc1p. We then went on to investigate the specificity of Arc1p by challenging it with a population of different tRNAs. Arc1p was incubated with total yeast tRNA, and the mixture was then loaded onto the column (Fig. 1D). As a control, total yeast tRNA was also analyzed in the absence of Arc1p (Fig. 1 E). The Arc1-tRNA mixture gave two peaks, one corresponding to free tRNAs (Pool B) and one corresponding to Arc1p and the Arc1p·tRNA complexes (Pool A). RNA extraction followed by electrophoresis revealed the presence of several tRNA species in this latter peak. To identify the tRNAs that associate with Arc1p, we performed extensive Northern analysis using probes against 16 different major isoacceptor tRNAs. As can be seen in Fig.2 A, these tRNAs can be divided in three groups. The first group (“strong binders”) contains tRNAs that bind significantly to Arc1p and includes tRNAGlu, elongator tRNAMet, tRNAPhe, tRNALys, and tRNAArg. In the second group (“weak binders”), the amount of bound tRNA represents only a small fraction of the total tRNA. Finally, in the third group (“nonbinders”), no tRNA could be detected comigrating with Arc1p. To confirm these results and to check whether the N-terminal domain of Arc1p plays a role in tRNA binding specificity, we repeated the analysis using the Arc1-ΔN mutant form. We obtained exactly the same results (data not shown), showing that the relative affinity of Arc1p for the tRNA species is determined solely by the TRBD that comprises the middle (M) and C-terminal (C) parts of Arc1p. The TRBD recognizes structural features that are common to all tRNAs. However, under competition conditions, which better mimic the in vivosituation, the TRBD binds preferentially to a subset of tRNA species,i.e. it exhibits broad specificity. It is possible that the tRNA species that binds strongly to Arc1p contains certain elements that facilitate the TRBD-tRNA interaction. Indeed, examination of the sequences of these tRNAs revealed a combination of nucleotides in certain positions that is unique for the strong binders. Some of these nucleotides, which include C2, G10, C25, C32, A44, G45, G51, G57, C63, and G71(highlighted in Fig. 2 B) may actually act as positive determinants for the interaction with Arc1p (see also “Discussion”). We then tried to reconstitute the Arc1p·MetRS complex to test its tRNA binding abilities compared with monomeric MetRS. First, purified MetRS was applied to the gel filtration column. The elution profile shows that MetRS migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa, confirming its monomeric nature (Fig. 3 A). When MetRS was pre-mixed with recombinant Arc1p, they were both eluted together as a heterodimer (Fig. 3 A). This shows that Arc1p and MetRS can readily associate in vitro, forming a stable complex. The size of this complex as well as its composition as analyzed by SDS-PAGE strongly suggest that it contains equimolar amounts of Arc1p and MetRS. Previous in vivo data suggest that the Arc1p-MetRS interaction is mediated by the N domain of Arc1p (28Simos G. Sauer A. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To also show that in vitro, we used the N domain instead of full-length Arc1p. As can be shown in Fig. 3 B, Arc1-N and MetRS associate readily to form a 132-kDa complex (the second peak with a molecular mass of 20 kDa corresponds to free Arc1-N, which was added in excess). We then tested both monomeric MetRS and the Arc1p·MetRS complex for binding to tRNA by incubating them with total yeast tRNA. Analysis of the MetRS-tRNA mixture by gel filtration showed that no tRNA could be detected in the fractions containing MetRS, indicating a lack of stable binding (Fig. 4). In contrast, one or possibly two tRNA species coeluted with the Arc1p·MetRS complex. To identify these tRNA species, we used Northern analysis as described above. This analysis (Fig. 4 B) showed that elongator tRNAMet shifted completely from the fractions containing the free pool of tRNA to the fractions containing the Arc1p·MetRS complex, indicating high affinity binding of this tRNA to the complex. Initiator tRNAMet could also be detected in association with the Arc1p·MetRS complex; however, the amount was smaller compared with what remained in the free pool. This confirms the previous observation that initiator tRNAMet is a poor binder for Arc1p. Apart of elongator and initiator tRNAMet, none of the other 11 tRNAs that were tested could be significantly recovered in the Arc1p·MetRS peak. These results show that high affinity binding of the cognate tRNA to MetRS can only be achieved when the enzyme is associated with Arc1p. In the Arc1p·MetRS complex, therefore, MetRS determines the specificity, whereas Arc1p provides the affinity for the interaction with tRNA. To reconstitute the ternary Arc1p· MetRS·GluRS complex, we needed to produce GluRS, which had never been purified before from yeast, as well as additional amounts of MetRS. To facilitate purification, the two enzymes were tagged at their N termini with a stretch of eight histidines and overexpressed in yeast cells. Soluble cell lysates were passed through a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column, and elution by 250 mm imidazole led to the efficient recovery of His8-MetRS or His8-GluRS (Fig. 5). To ensure removal of minor contaminants, the proteins were further purified by ion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column (Fig. 5). The purification scheme proved to be very efficient since ∼1.2 mg of purified tagged MetRS or GluRS could be recovered from a 1-liter culture of the corresponding overexpressing yeast cells. Purified His8-MetRS and His8-GluRS were loaded onto the gel filtration column alone or after being mixed and incubated with one another or with roughly equimolar amounts of Arc1p. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 6 A and Table I. When applied alone, both enzymes were eluted from the column as monomers. When incubated together, His8-MetRS and His8-GluRS remained monomeric, showing that no direct interaction can take place between them in vitro. However, incubation with Arc1p resulted in the formation of stable dimeric and stoichiometric complexes, both, in the case of His8-MetRS and His8-GluRS. Finally, incubation of both enzymes together with Arc1p led to the assembly of all three components into a ternary complex with an apparent stoichiometry of 1:1:1. As in the case for the Arc1p·MetRS complex, the N domain of Arc1p was sufficient to convey association with His8-GluRS (Fig. 6 B and Table I). Moreover, the 20-kDa N domain of Arc1p could accommodate the interactions with both aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Fig. 6 B). Therefore, the N domain of Arc1p is the central component of the Arc1p-synthetase complex and must contain binding sites for both MetRS and GluRS. To test the effect of Arc1p on GluRS, monomeric His8-GluRS or the in vitro reconstituted Arc1p·His8-GluRS binary complex was incubated with total yeast tRNA and applied to the gel filtration column. As shown in Fig.7 A, a single tRNA species bound to and coeluted with His8-GluRS (Pool III). Northern analysis (Fig. 7 B) demonstrated that this tRNA species corresponds to the cognate tRNAGlu. As estimated by scanning the autoradiograms, almost 40% of the tRNAGlu in the total yeast tRNA mixture shifted to fractions containing His8-GluRS, showing that, unlike MetRS, monomeric His8-GluRS is able to form a stable complex with its cognate tRNA. The stability of this complex was significantly in"

During the last 10 years, there has been an increasing interest in their biogenesis, which involves the transport of both the apoprotein and prosthetic groups, their folding, and their subsequent assembly into the corresponding complexes. In the case ofc-type cytochromes, the covalent attachment of heme to the apoprotein occurs at the site of function, which is a different subcellular compartment from that in which synthesis of heme or apocytochromes occurs. These two characteristics add a further complexity to the post-translational maturation pathway of these heme-containing proteins. Genetic analysis of model organisms has led to the identification of three different systems for the maturation of c-type cytochromes (1Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 2Page M., D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S., J. Trends Biochem.

Although system I and system II share common elements, genome sequencing projects have shown that no homology could be found between systems I and III. InEscherichia coli (system I) at least eight genes,ccmA–ccmH 1, are essential for the production of holocytochrome c (3Thöny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Kunzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J.

In contrast, in yeast mitochondria (system III), only two proteins, cytochromec and cytochrome c 1 heme lyases were shown to be the central components of the formation of holocytochromes (5Dumont M. Ernst J. Hampsey D. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 6Zollner A. Rodel G. Haid A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Orthologues of fungal heme lyases were found in vertebrate and invertebrate nuclear genomes but not in plant genomes. Unexpectedly, land plant mitochondrial genomes encode orthologues of bacterialccm genes, namely ccmB, ccmC, andccmF (7Oda K. Yamato K. Ohta E. Nakamura Y. Takemura M. Nozato N. Akashi K. Kanegae T.

Genet. 1997; 15: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). These genes are also found in the mitochondrial genome of early diverging protists such as Reclinomonas americana (9Lang B.F. Burger G. O'Kelly C.J. Cedergren R. Golding G.B. Lemieux C. Sankoff D. Turmel M. Gray M.W. Nature. 1997; 387: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) but not in the mitochondrial or nuclear genomes of yeast. This finding reveals that at least two distinct routes forc-type cytochrome assembly were established during mitochondrial evolution as exemplified by yeast and land plants. Plant mitochondria have evolved unique strategies for the structure and expression of their genetic information (10Schuster W. Brennicke A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 61-78Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and have developed specific biochemical and physiological functions as organelles belonging to photosynthetic organisms (11Mackenzie S.A. McIntosh L. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The c-type cytochrome maturation pathway is an example of the specific features displayed by plant mitochondria compared with their mammalian or fungal counterparts. All mitochondria contain two c-type cytochromes: cytochromec 1 is part of complex III (cytochromec reductase), whereas cytochrome c shuttles from complex III to complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase). Both apoproteins are synthesized in the cytosol and are imported post-translationally into the mitochondrial inner membrane and intermembrane space. Heme needs to be translocated from the matrix side of the inner membrane where ferrochelatase, the last enzyme in its biosynthesis, is located (12Harbin B.M. Dailey H.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to the intermembrane space where ligation to apocytochrome takes place. In plants, δ-aminolevulinate, the universal precursor of tetrapyrroles (chlorophyll and heme) is formed in chloroplasts via the C5 (glutamate) pathway (13Jahn D. Verkamp E. Soll D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 215-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), whereas in yeast and mammals, it is synthesized by 5-δ-aminolevulinate synthase, a mitochondrial enzyme (14Jordan P., M. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, New York1990: 55-122Google Scholar). The next steps of protoporphyrin IX synthesis involve trafficking in cytosol, mitochondria, and plastids in the case of plant cells (15Grimm B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The trafficking of heme precursors in eukaryotic cells is poorly understood as is the intracellular transport of heme in the cytoplasm or to the nucleus where heme is implicated in transcriptional regulation. In animals and fungi, a short sequence called the “CPV” motif is conserved in cytochrome heme lyases and in other heme-binding proteins such as the transcription factor Hap1, 5-δ-aminolevulinate synthase or heme oxygenase-2 (16Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In cytochromec 1 heme lyase, this motif has been shown to bind heme in a reversible manner (17Steiner H. Zollner A. Haid A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32605-32611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanisms of the transient heme binding to the CPV motif is still unknown. In bacteria, CcmE is crucial for cytochrome c maturation. This periplasmic protein is anchored in the membrane by its N-terminal hydrophobic domain (18Ritz D. Thöny-Meyer L. Hennecke H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The CcmE protein from E. coli was shown to be a heme-binding protein (19Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Reid E. Eaves D.J. Cole J.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 166: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The bacterial CcmE protein is characterized by two stretches of conserved amino acids, of which one contains a strictly conserved histidine shown to bind heme covalently (19Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This protein is believed to capture heme in the periplasm in the presence of CcmC (21Schulz H. Fabianek R.

In this paper we present the characterization of Arabidopsis thalianaCCME, a plant orthologue of E. coliCcmE. We show that the nuclear gene AtCCME encodes a mitochondrial protein attached to the inner membrane and oriented toward the intermembrane space. We have tested the extent to which the plant mitochondrial CCME could substitute for its E. coli orthologue in vivo. AtCCME cDNA clone (GenBankTM accession number ATU72502) was obtained from F. Grellet (CNRS, Perpignan France). Plasmids expressing AtCCME under an arabinose-inducible promoter were constructed by PCR.1 To generate the plasmid pAT1, the coding region of AtCCME corresponding to Met79-Ser256 was amplified using O1 and O2 as 5′ and 3′ primers respectively. The PCR fragment was cloned in the BamHI site of pUC19. Clones with the correct orientation were checked by sequencing, theNdeI/EcoRI fragment was cut out and cloned into pISC-2. The His222 to Ala AtCCME mutant was generated by “overlap extension” PCR technique. Two overlapping complementary oligonucleotides, O3 and O4, were designed to introduce the mutation. Two amplifications were performed separately using O1-O3 and O4-O5 primer pairs. The purified PCR products were annealed and amplified with O1 and O5. The final PCR product was cut by NdeI andEcoRI and cloned into pISC-2, generating pAT2, as follows: O1, 5′-CGGGATCCATATGCAGAATCGCCGTTTATGG-3′; O2, 5′-CTCCGGATCCTAAGAAGCCGCAACTTCAGC-3′; O3, 5′-CTCATCAGCCTTAGCCAAAACTTCAGTC-3′; O4, 5′-GGCTAAGGCTGATGAGAAGTATATGCCA-3′; O5, 5′-GAAGAATTCAGGATCCTAAGAAGCCGCAACTTC-3′. Restriction sites are shown in italics. The E. coli ccmE gene was amplified by PCR and cloned as anNdeI-EcoRI fragment into pISC-2, resulting in pEC412, and the cloned DNA was sequenced.

Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1329-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The broken cells were diluted in a large volume of the extraction buffer, and differential centrifugations were carried out as described previously (33Day D.A. Neuburger M. Douce R. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1985; 12: 219-228Crossref Google Scholar). The chloroplast-enriched fraction was loaded onto a 40/80% Percoll step gradient, and intact chloroplast were collected as described (31Sakamoto W. Spielewoy N. Bonnard G. Murata M. Wintz H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 1157-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were layered onto a 13.5–21-45% Percoll step gradient and spun at 75,000 × g for 45 min. The mitochondria were collected at the 21/45% interface and washed in the extraction buffer without bovine serum albumin and dithiothreitol. Mitoplasts were prepared as described (34Sparace S.A. Moore T.S. Plant Physiol. 1979; 63: 963-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications (35Zhuo D.G. Bonen L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mitochondria were resuspended in a swelling buffer, and the outer membrane rupture was achieved by Dounce homogenization. Mitoplast and outer membrane fractions were isolated after centrifugation through a bovine serum albumin-free discontinuous gradient of 22, 33, and 47% sucrose. Outer membranes were collected at the 8.6/22% interface, diluted, and recovered by centrifugation at 38,000 rpm in a Ti-75 rotor. Intact mitoplasts were collected from the 33/47% interface, washed and resuspended in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml, and broken by three freeze/thaw cycles followed by sonication (5× 10 s, 300 W, Sonic Vibra Cells). The membrane (P) and soluble (S) fraction of mitoplasts were separated by a 30-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor. The soluble proteins were precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid. The membrane fraction was subjected to alkaline treatment (0.1m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, for 30 min at 4 °C) to extract peripheral proteins (36Fujiki Y. Fowler S. Shio H. Hubbard A.L. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). A 30-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor allows the separation of soluble (peripheral) from insoluble (integral) protein fractions. Freshly purified mitoplasts were subjected to proteinase K treatment. Mitoplasts (1 mg/ml) were incubated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K in 8.6% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 30 min at 4 °C. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added at the final concentration of 1 mm to stop the protease activity, and the mitoplasts were recovered by centrifugation through a 22% sucrose cushion at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Mitochondria were isolated from potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum, var. Bintje) with a juice extractor as described (37Fey J. Vermel M. Grienenberger J.M. Maréchal-Drouard L. Gualberto J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Proteins were synthesized from the corresponding cDNA clones in pBluescript vector by coupled transcription/translation in the presence of [35S]methionine according the supplier's instruction (Promega). Import assays were carried out as described (38Wischmann C. Schuster W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The physical and genetic analysis of a nuclear gene cluster on A. thalianachromosome 3 (39Sadowski J. Gaubier P. Delseny M. Quiros C.F. Mol. Gen.

Biol. 1999; 41: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), revealed the presence of AtCCME, a gene encoding a protein showing sequence similarity with the E. coli CcmE (3Thöny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Kunzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4321-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its orthologues for Gram-negative bacteria (4Thöny-Meyer L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

All cDNAs, isolated from a library prepared from growing cell suspensions, share the same 5′-end at only 5 nucleotides from the initiation codon, whereas two different polyadenylated ends were found at 226 and 268 nucleotides from the stop codon. 2F. Grellet, personal communication. No transcript could be detected by Northern experiments, but reverse transcription-PCR experiments allow detection of AtCCMEtranscripts in the roots, rosette leaves, stems, stem leaves and flowers of A. thaliana (data not shown). A radiolabeled probe generated from AtCCME cDNA (ATU72502) was used for Southern hybridization of A. thaliana total DNA. The probe hybridized to a single DNA fragment for each of the five restriction enzymes used. The sizes of the bands correspond to those deduced from the physical map of the AtCCME genomic locus (Fig.1, A and B). Therefore, inA. thaliana, CCME is a single-copy gene located on chromosome 3 and is expressed at a low level. AtCCME cDNA encodes a putative protein of 256 amino acids, which presents an N-terminal extension of about 70–80 amino acids when compared with bacterial proteins (Fig.2). An extension of a similar size is also present in the putative protein encoded by a CCMEhomologous gene of Oryza sativa (AC025783). In AtCCME, this extension is enriched in positively charged (Arg) and hydroxylated (Ser) residues and contains few acidic residues. Its first 20 amino acids could form an amphiphilic α-helix. These features are characteristic of the import domain of mitochondrial targeting sequences (42Gavel Y. Nilsson L. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 43Whelan J. Glaser E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 771-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The localization of AtCCME was checked first by immunodetection using purified polyclonal antibodies generated against an overexpressed fusion protein (from Phe111 to Ser256). The anti-AtCCME antibodies recognized a 27-kDa protein in mitochondria but not in chloroplast protein fractions prepared from A. thaliana protoplasts (Fig.3 A). CCME could also be detected in cauliflower, turnip, rapeseed, and radish mitochondria, but not in potato, pea, sunflower, wheat, and maize mitochondria, indicating that anti-AtCCME antibodies are rather specific toBrassica species (data not shown). To test whetherAtCCME encodes a precursor processed after import, we tried to import the radiolabeled protein in vitro into purified mitochondria. A major 32-kDa protein was obtained by in vitro coupled transcription/translation of AtCCMEcDNA (Fig. 3 B). After its incubation with mitochondria, a signal corresponding to a 27-kDa protein resistant to added proteinase K appeared. The protection was abolished when mitochondrial membrane proteins were extracted by Triton X-100 before proteinase K treatment. AtCCME import was inhibited in the presence of valinomycin, indicating the requirement of an electrochemical membrane potential, Δψ, to achieve AtCCME translocation (44Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). A 5-kDa reduction was observed between the apparent molecular weights of the precursor and the mature protein. For the mitochondrial processing peptidase domain, only a weak consensus has been found, mainly a conserved Arg in position-2 or-3 from the cleavage site. For plant mitochondrial precursors, two cleavage motifs were proposed (45Sjöling S. Glaser E. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 136-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar), of which one, an “R-2” motif (RX(A/S)(T/S)), is present at position 47–50 (RLSS, Fig. 2). Although the actual processing site has not been determined experimentally, the R-2 motif described above is a good candidate. A cleavage at this position would shorten the precursor protein by 48 amino acids, corresponding to a 5.4-kDa peptide, which is in agreement with the shift observed in import assays. The radioactive band of the in vitro processed protein and the immunodetected A. thaliana endogenous mitochondrial protein migrate at the same position (Fig. 3 C), which strongly suggests that in vitro processing in potato mitochondria reflects in vivo maturation of A. thaliana protein.Figure 3AtCCME is imported into mitochondria. A, Western blot analysis of Arabidopsis protein fractions (30 μg) of protoplast (P), chloroplast (C), and mitochondria (M), probed with antibodies directed against AtCCME, NAD9, LSU (large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase), and α-tubulin. B, in vitro translated AtCCME precursor (Pre, p) corresponds to a 32-kDa band (lane 1). In the presence of mitochondria (M), a smaller protein corresponding to the mature form appears at 27 kDa. This mature protein is resistant to proteinase K (PK) in intact mitochondria but is degraded when mitochondria membranes are disrupted by Triton X-100 (TX). The import process is abolished in the presence of valinomycin (Val). The precursor and the mature polypeptides are indicated by arrows. Lane 1 contains one-fifth of the amount of precursor included in each import reaction. 40 μg of purified potato mitochondria were used for each import assay. Proteins were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel; proteins labeled with [35S]Met were detected by autoradiography for 2 weeks at −80 °C. C, in vitro translated AtCCME precursor (lane 1), import assay of AtCCME in potato mitochondria (lane 2), and 20 μg of A. thalianatotal mitochondrial proteins (lane 3) were loaded on the same gel. After Western blotting, the membrane was cut in two pieces: one was exposed to a film (lanes 1 and 2), and the second probed with the purified anti-AtCCME antibody (lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Bacterial CcmE are mainly hydrophilic proteins except for a short hydrophobic region at the N-terminal domain, which is predicted to act as a noncleavable signal sequence and to anchor the protein in the membrane. Although its amino acid sequence is not conserved, such a hydrophobic domain is present in AtCCME (Fig. 2), which could, as for its bacterial counterparts, attach the protein in a membrane. AtCCME antibody recognized a protein of 27 kDa in the mitochondria (M) and mitoplasts fraction (MP), whereas no signal could be detected in the outer membrane fraction (OM), characterized by the presence of porin, a major protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane (25Heins L. Mentzel H. Schmid A. Benz R. Schmitz U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26402-26410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the absence of cytochrome c 1, a subunit of the mitochondrial inner membrane cytochrome bc 1 complex (Fig.4 A). The presence of porin in the mitoplast fraction indicated that, in the experimental conditions used, part of the outer membrane remains attached to the inner membrane, most likely at contact points between the two membranes. The mitoplasts were broken and further separated into soluble (S) and membrane (P) protein fractions; AtCCME was present in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4 B"

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these terminal Golgi carbohydrate modifications primarily involve mannose additions that utilize GDP-mannose as the substrate. The transport of GDP-mannose from its site of synthesis in the cytosol into the lumen of the Golgi is mediated by theVRG4 gene product, a nucleotide sugar transporter that is a member of a large family of related membrane proteins. Loss ofVRG4 function leads to lethality, but several viablevrg4 mutants were isolated whose GDP-mannose transport activity was reduced but not obliterated. Mutations in these alleles mapped to a region of the Vrg4 protein that is highly conserved among other GDP-mannose transporters but not other types of nucleotide sugar transporters. Here, we present evidence that suggest an involvement of this region of the protein in binding GDP-mannose. Most of the mutations that were introduced within this conserved domain, spanning amino acids 280–291 of Vrg4p, lead to lethality, and none interfere with Vrg4 protein stability, localization, or dimer formation. The null phenotype of these mutant vrg4 alleles can be complemented by their overexpression. Vesicles prepared from vrg4 mutant strains were reduced in luminal GDP-mannose transport activity, but this effect could be suppressed by increasing the concentration of GDP-mannose in vitro. Thus, either an increased substrate concentration, in vitro, or an increased Vrg4 protein concentration, in vivo, can suppress these vrg4 mutant phenotypes. Vrg4 proteins with alterations in this region were reduced in binding to guanosine 5′-[γ-32P]triphosphate γ-azidoanilide, a photoaffinity substrate analogue whose binding to Vrg4-HAp was specifically inhibited by GDP-mannose. Taken together, these data are consistent with the model that amino acids in this region of the yeast GDP-mannose transporter mediate the recognition of or binding to nucleotide sugar prior to its transport into the Golgi.

The substrates utilized by the luminal Golgi glycosyltransferases are nucleotide sugars, whose site of synthesis is the cytosol. Delivery of these molecules into the Golgi is mediated by membrane-bound nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs).1 A large and growing number of related membrane proteins in this family have been identified in eukaryotes. NSTs differ from one another in their substrate specificity and also in their cellular locations. Mammalian glycoconjugates are modified by many different types of sugars, requiring a correspondingly large number of different NSTs that are localized in the ER, Golgi, and even the nucleus (see Refs. 1Kawakita M. Ishida N. Miura N. Sun-Wada G.H. Yoshioka S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and 2Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar for reviews). Plants and lower eukaryotes also require nucleotide sugar uptake into compartments of the secretory pathway for the biosynthesis of certain extracellular polysaccharides that are structural components of their cell wall but whose synthesis, at least in part, occurs intracellularly. In plants, both hemicellulose and pectin are synthesized in the Golgi (3Zhang G.F. Staehelin L.A. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 1070-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 4White A.R. Xin Y. Pezeshk V. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and NST activities required for their synthesis, including UDP-glucose and GDP-fucose transporters have been characterized (5Munoz P. Norambuena L. Orellana A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6Neckelmann G. Orellana A.

Regulation of NST activity has been hypothesized to be an important mechanism to regulate glycosylation, through the provision of substrate. This idea is supported by the severe glycosylation phenotypes caused by mutations in various NST genes (8Descouteaux A. Luo Y. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Miura N. Ishida N. Hoshino M. Yamauchi M. Hara T. Ayusawa D. Kawakita M. J. Biochem.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20189-20195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The molecular details of nucleotide sugar recognition by the NSTs remain unresolved. Early studies established that NSTs recognize both the nucleotide and sugar portions of nucleotide sugars, although the primary determinant for specificity resides in the nucleotide (13Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 777: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although it was believed that each NST recognizes only one type of nucleotide sugar, recent studies of the Leishmania GDP-mannose transporter suggest that this notion may apply to only a subclass of NSTs. The Leishmania GDP-mannose transporter, whose physiological substrate is GDP-mannose, is capable of transporting GDP-mannose, GDP-fucose, and GDP-arabinose in vitro (14Hong K. Ma D. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2013-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Functional analyses of several NSTs, including the yeast GDP-mannose transporter, the human UDP-galactose transporter, and the murine and human CMP-sialic acid transporters identified domains required for protein stability, folding, and transport (12Eckhardt M. Gotza B. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20189-20195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 15Aoki K. Sun-Wada G.-H. Segawa H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N.

However, virtually nothing is known about what contributes to the substrate specificity that distinguishes each of the NSTs. In the yeast, S. cerevisiae, proteins and lipids are modified in the Golgi primarily by the addition of mannose, using GDP-mannose as the substrate. The VRG4 gene encodes the yeast GDP-mannose transporter (18Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (31903, (1914)): 31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As expected for the sole provider of the substrate required for protein glycosylation in the Golgi,VRG4 is an essential gene. Several viable mutants of the yeast GDP-mannose transporter have been isolated that exhibit severe glycosylation defects (17Abe M. Hashimoto H. Yoda K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Dean N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1287-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Kanik-Enulat C. Montalvo E. Neff N. Genetics. 1995; 140: 933-943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we identify, by genetic and biochemical analysis of the mutant proteins encoded by vrg4 alleles, a motif that is critically important for glycosylation and nucleotide sugar transport but which, when mutated, does not interfere with Vrg4 protein stability, Golgi localization, or multimerization properties. This motif is highly conserved in GDP-mannose transporters but not in other types of nucleotide sugar transporters, implying a role in binding to nucleotide sugar or nucleoside monophosphate. Mutational analysis of this region demonstrated that an alteration of most of the nonvariant amino acids in this region are required for viability, but this phenotype can be complemented by overexpression of these vrg4 alleles as a consequence of producing higher levels of mutant Vrg4 protein in vivo. Biochemical analyses of these mutant Vrg4 proteins demonstrated that their reduced transport activity could also be overcome by increasing substrate concentration. These mutant proteins also display a reduced affinity toward the photo probe, [γ-32P]GTP-azidoanilide, implicating this domain in the mediation of substrate binding. Standard yeast media and genetic techniques were used (21Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Hygromycin B sensitivity was tested on yeast extract/peptone/adenine sulfate/dextrose plates (YPAD) supplemented with 30–50 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described (19Dean N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1287-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). NDY5 (MATα ura3–52 leu2–211 vrg4-2) (10Poster J.B. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3837-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was used as the source of genomic DNA for the cloning of the vrg4-2 allele. Its isogenic parental strain is RSY255 (MATα ura3–52 leu2–211). XGY13 is a derivative of RSY255 but contains an HA-tagged allele of VRG4 integrated at theura3–52 locus, driven by the TPI promoter (16Gao X.D. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17718-17727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). XGY14 was constructed from W303a (MATa ade2–1 ura3–1 his3–11 trp1–1 leu2–3, 112 can1–100) in which VRG4 is under the control of the GAL1 promoter. XGY15 and XGY16 are derivatives of XGY14 but contain, in addition, a TPI-driven HA-tagged allele of VRG4 or vrg4-A286D, respectively, integrated at the ura3–52 locus. JPY26–3d (MATα ura3–52 leu2–211 his3 dpm1 vrg4-2) or the VRG4 isogenic parental strain, JPY25–6c (MATα ura3–52 leu2–211 his3 dpm1) (18Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol.

A 1.35-kb fragment containing the vrg4-2 open reading frame and 237 base pairs of 5′-flanking and 72 base pairs of 3′-flanking sequences, was amplified by PCR using LA Taq thermophilic DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Shuzo, Japan) from genomic DNA isolated from the vrg4-2 strain, NDY5 (10Poster J.B. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3837-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These PCR products were directly cloned into the pCRII-TA cloning vector (InVitrogen) to generate pCRIIvrg4-2. Plasmids from three independent clones were isolated, and the sequence from each of these was compared with the VRG4 gene isolated by PCR from the isogenic parental strain and cloned in the same way to exclude PCR-derived mutations. DNA sequencing was performed as described (22Machida M. Chang Y.C. Manabe M. Yasukawa M. Kunihiro S. Jigami Y. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using the Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), using an automated LI-COR 4000L DNA sequencer. Standard molecular biology techniques were used for all plasmid constructions (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). To construct a series of equivalent expression plasmids containing either the VRG4 or vrg4-2 allele that differ only in the A286D mutation, at nucleotide position 857, a 251-base pair Hpa I/Mfe I fragment from pCRIIvrg4-2, containing this point mutation, was used to replace the same region in the wild type VRG4 gene. The plasmid, pRSvrg4-A286D was made by replacing thisHpa I/Mfe I fragment in pRHL (10Poster J.B. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3837-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which contains the VRG4 gene under its own promoter in pRS316, aCEN6/URA3 vector (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To introduce a C-terminal HA tag, the 3′-end of vrg4-A286D gene, lacking the point mutation, was substituted with a 0.5-kb Mfe I/Sac I fragment from SK−RHL-HA3 (18Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (31903, (1914)): 31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that contains the corresponding 3′-end of the VRG4 gene with the triple HA tag. This plasmid, pRSvrg4-A286D-HA3, encodes thevrg4-A286D mutant protein tagged with three copies of the HA epitope at the C terminus in pRS316. Using the same strategy, pRSvrg4-A286D-myc3 was constructed by replacement of theMfe I/Sac I fragment of pRSvrg4-A286D with that from SK−VRG4-myc3 (16Gao X.D. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17718-17727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which has three copies of the myc epitope at the C terminus. To construct pRS315vrg4-A286D-myc3, a Hin dIII/Sac I fragment from pRSvrg4-A286D-myc3 containing the entirevrg4-A286D-myc 3 ORF and VRG4 promoter sequences was subcloned into pRS315, a CEN6/LEU2 vector (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, pRS315-VRG4-myc3 was generated by subcloning a Hin dIII/Sac I fragment from pRS316VRG4-myc3 (16Gao X.D. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17718-17727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) into pRS315. YEpGAPvrg4-A286D-HA3 was made by replacing the 251-base pair Hpa I/Mfe I fragment from pCRIIvrg4-2, containing the A286D mutation, in YEpGAPVRG4-HA3 (16Gao X.D. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17718-17727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This plasmid encodes HA-tagged vrg4-A286D under the control of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (TDH3) promoter in the 2μ/URA3 vector YEpGAP (25Gao X.D. Kaigorodov V. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21450-21456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A series of plasmids containing mutant vrg4 alleles with a single missense mutations that affect amino acids within the consensus motif (spanning amino acids 280–291) were created as follows. AnEco RI/Sal I fragment containing the entire wild type VRG4-HA 3 gene was subcloned into pBluescript SK− (Stratagene) to generate pSK−VRG4-HA3. This SK−VRG4-HA3 plasmid was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis, using the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenic primers were designed to change Thr280, Ser282, Gly285, Leu287, Asn288, Lys289, or Pro291 to alanine and the Gly285 or Lys289 to aspartate. This generated a series of mutant vrg4 alleles in pBluescript SK−, including pSK−vrg4-T280A-HA3, pSK−vrg4-S282A-HA3, pSK−vrg4-G285A-HA3, pSK−vrg4-G285D-HA3, pSK−vrg4-L287A-HA3, pSK−vrg4-N288A-HA3, pSK−vrg4-K289A-HA3, pSK−vrg4-K289D-HA3, and pSK−vrg4-P291A-HA3. All of these mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. To express these mutant vrg4 alleles at physiological levels from the VRG4 promoter in a CEN-containing vector, the Hpa I/Xba I fragment in pRHL-HA3 (18Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (31903, (1914)): 31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was replaced with a 0.5-kbHpa I/Xba I fragment from each of the pSK− mutant vrg4 plasmid series. This generated a plasmid series in which each of the mutant HA-tagged vrg4 alleles was cloned in pRS316, including pRSvrg4-T280A-HA3, pRSvrg4-S282A-HA3, pRSvrg4-G285A-HA3, pRSvrg4-G285D-HA3, pRSvrg4-L287A-HA3, pRSvrg4-N288A-HA3, pRSvrg4-K289A-HA3, pRSvrg4-K289D-HA3, and pRSvrg4-P291A-HA3. Some of these mutant vrg4 alleles were also tagged with the myc epitope. These plasmids were constructed by replacing the 3′-end of each vrg4 mutant allele with the correspondingMfe I/Xba I fragment from pSK- VRG4-myc 3. The resulting plasmids contain the myc-tagged mutant vrg4 alleles in pRS316. To place these genes in a CEN6/LEU2 vector, a 1.3-kbHin dIII/Xba I fragment containing the entire mutant vrg4-myc 3 ORF and VRG4 promoter sequences was subcloned into pRS315 (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pRS315vrg4-G285D-myc3 and pRS315vrg4-K289A-myc3. To express these mutant vrg4 alleles in yeast at high copy, under the control of the TDH3 promoter in a 2μ vector,Eco RI/Xho I fragments containing the entire mutated vrg4-HA gene from each of these plasmids were ligated into YEpGAP. This generated the series of mutant HA-taggedvrg4 alleles, described above, in YEpGAP. To construct integration plasmids, an Eco RI/Sal I fragment from pSK−VRG4-HA or pSK−vrg4-HA, containing just the ORF was cloned into pTαO (26Dean N. Pelham H.R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which places their expression under the constitutive triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI) promoter. Linearization of these plasmids withXho I within the URA3 gene targets integration at the ura3–52 locus Exponentially growing yeast cells (A 600 = 1–3) were harvested and converted to spheroplasts with lyticase, as described (27Chi J.H. Roos J. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3132-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts from 3–4 OD units of cells were resuspended in 400 μl of ice cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing either 1% digitonin or 1% Triton X-100 to solubilize membrane proteins and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C at 14,000 × g to remove debris. These detergent extracts were used as the source for both Western blot analyses, performed as described (16Gao X.D. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17718-17727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and for the coimmunoprecipitation assays, described below. The HA-tagged or myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubating 400 μl of a detergent extract with 200 μl of a hybridoma cell culture supernatants containing the 12CA5 monoclonal anti-HA antibody and 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature for 2 h and processed for 10% SDS-PAGE as described (16Gao X.D. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17718-17727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed with anti-myc A-14 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used at a 1:3000 dilution and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham) followed by autoradiography. Indirect immunofluorescence of yeast cells expressing Vrg4-HAp or HA-tagged Vrg4 mutant proteins and data analyses were as described (18Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (31903, (1914)): 31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Permeabilized yeast cells were prepared as described (18Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (31903, (1914)): 31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Permeabilized yeast cells were quickly thawed at 37 °C and washed three times with 1.0 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Hepes (pH 6.8), 150 mm KoAc, 250 mm sorbitol) by a quick pulse in a microcentrifuge. Pelleted cells were resuspended in buffer A to ½ their original volume. Each reaction contained 40 μl of concentrated permeabilized yeast cells (about 7A 600 units), to which was added guanosine 5′-[γ-32P]triphosphate γ-azidoanilide (Affinity Labeling Inc., Lexington, KY) to a final concentration of 5 μm. Each reaction was incubated with the photo probe at room temperature for 1 min before exposing to short wave UV light, using a hand-held UV lamp (Photodyne, CA) for 90 s. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 2 μl of 0.5 mdithiothreitol, and samples were placed on ice. Free radioactive solutes were removed by washing the cells three times with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A. Proteins were solubilized with 500 μl of ice cold 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and centrifuged for 3 min at 14,000 ×g to remove debris. For the visualization of32P-labeled proteins, 20 μl of this Triton X-100 extract was directly applied to SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, aliquots were immunoprecipitated by the addition of anti-HA antibody and protein A-Sepharose for 1–2 h. The precipitated protein was washed with PBS plus 1% Triton three times, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated at 55 °C, and fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE. For visualizing32P-labeled proteins, polyacrylamide gels were dried down and directly exposed to x-ray film. For immunodetection of Vrg4-HA, proteins were transferred from the polyacrylamide gel to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) and detected by Western immunoblotting using anti-HA antibodies. Exponentially growing yeast cells (A 600 = 2–3) were harvested, resuspended in spheroplast buffer (1.0 m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm magnesium chloride, 0.14% 2-mercaptoethanol) and converted to spheroplasts by the addition of 5 units of lyticase/A 600 of cells, as described previously (16Gao X.D. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17718-17727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After washing twice with ice-cold spheroplast buffer, spheroplasts from 500 A 600 units of cells were suspended in 10 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.25 mmsorbitol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) including a protease inhibitor mixture (200 μm leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmchloro-(4-tosylamido)7-amino-2-heptanone-HCl, 1 μmpepstatin) and lysed by Dounce homogenization. After centrifugation at 3000 × g for 3 min to remove unbroken cells and debris, the supernatant (S3) was collected and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to yield a pellet (P17) and a supernatant (S17). The S17 supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min to produce a Golgi-enriched fraction (P100). The P100 fractions were resuspended into 200 μl of buffer 88 (0.25 m sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate), and their protein concentrations were determined by the BCA reagent (Pierce).The GDP-mannose transport assay was performed according to the procedure described by Roy et al. (28Roy S.K. Yoko-o T. Ikenaga H. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2583-2590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 500 μg of the P100 fraction was incubated in buffer 88 containing variable amounts of GDP-[3H]mannose (180 cpm/pmol) at 30 °C for 5 min in a final volume of 100 μl. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold buffer 88 and placed on ice. Diluted samples were filtrated and washed with 15 ml of buffer 88 on 24-mm diameter, 0.45-μm pore size HA filters (Millipore Corp.). After air drying, filters were dissolved in 1 ml of ethylene glycol methyl ether, and the radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting. Counts bound to membranes at time 0 were used to determine the amount of GDP-[3H]mannose that nonspecifically bound to the membrane. Although a deletion of the VRG4 gene is lethal, we previously isolated a viable allele of vrg4 that has a severe glycosylation phenotype both in vivo and in vitro. vrg4-2 strains are defective in glycoprotein and glycolipid glycosylation and display a level of nucleotide sugar transport activity in vitro that is about 25% reduced from those of wild type strains (18Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (31903, (1914)): 31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To identify the molecular basis for this mutant phenotype, the sequence of the vrg4-2 mutant allele was determined. The mutant gene was cloned by PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). A comparison of the DNA sequence from the mutant and wild type VRG4 gene revealed a single C to A base pair change at nucleotide position 857. This mutation results in the replacement of an alanine with an aspartate at position 286, whose location in the protein is shown graphically in the hydropathy plot in Fig. 1 A. This mutant protein will be referred to as Vrg4-A286Dp. Three other viable missense mutations in VRG4 with similar defects in glycosylation have also been mapped to this region. The vig4-1 allele contains an alteration of the same Ala286, but to Val; vig4-2 contains an amino acid substitution of Ser278 to Cys (17Abe M. Hashimoto H. Yoda K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The van2-93 mutation replaces Arg274 with His (20Kanik-Enulat C. Montalvo E. Neff N. Genetics. 1995; 140: 933-943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these amino acids are clustered in a region of the protein spanning amino acids 271–291 that is highly conserved in other GDP-mannose transporters, including those from Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, 2A. Nishikawa, J. Poster, and N. Dean, unpublished results. andLeishmania donovani (29Ma D. Russell D.G. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3799-3805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and putative NSTs fromArabidopsis, rice, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe that were identified through their strong sequence homology to Vrg4p (Fig. 1 B). The consensus motif surrounding Ala286 is WXXX TTYSX VG(A/S)LNK(L/I)P. We henceforth refer to this as the GALNK motif. An alignment of this region from proteins closely related to Vrg4p and GDP-mannose transporters (group I proteins) or to the UDP-sugar transporters (group II proteins) is shown in Fig. 1 B. The use of secondary structure algorithms and hydropathy analysis predicts that Vrg4p contains between 6 and 8 transmembrane-spanning domains. Since both the N and C termini of Vrg4p face the cytoplasm (16Gao X.D. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17718-17727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the GALNK-containing region is predicted to span the junction between the penultimate transmembrane-spanning domain and the preceding hydrophilic loop (see Fig. 1 A), with the conserved Ala286 just abutting the lipid bilayer at the cytosolic face. Strikingly, when this same predicted domain from the family of UDP-sugar transporters is aligned to Vrg4p (based on hydropathy profiles), certain amino acids are also invariantly conserved, including those aligning to Thr281, Lys289, and Phe300 of Vrg4p, but this GALNK motif is unique to Vrg4p and related GDP-mannose transporters. To examine whether mutations in this conserved region are important for Vrg4p function, site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter the invariant amino acids in this region to Ala, except for Gly285 and Lys289, which were changed to Ala or Asp. The mutations that were introduced and their resulting phenotypes, using each of the assays described below, are summarized in TableI.Table IPhenotypes of vrg4 “GALNK” mutantsMutation1-aThe position and amino acid residue altered in Vrg4p.Viability1-bGrowth complementation ofGAL1-VRG4 st"

Bach1 forms a heterodimer with MafK, a member of the small Maf protein family (MafF, MafG, and MafK), which recognizes the NF-E2/Maf recognition element, a cis-regulatory motif containing a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element. Here we describe the gene structure of human BACH1, including a newly identified promoter and an alternatively RNA-spliced truncated form of BACH1, designated BACH1t, abundantly transcribed in human testis. The alternate splicing originated from the usage of a novel exon located 5.6 kilobase pairs downstream of the exon encoding the leucine zipper domain, and produced a protein that contained the conserved BTB/POZ, Cap'n collar, and basic region domains, but lacked the leucine zipper domain essential for NF-E2/Maf recognition element binding. Subcellular localization studies using green fluorescent protein as a reporter showed that full-length BACH1 localized to the cytoplasm, whereas BACH1t accumulated in the nucleus. Interestingly, coexpression of BACH1 and BACH1t demonstrated interaction between the molecules and the induction of nuclear import of BACH1.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The Drosophila pipsqueak (psq) gene encodes a BTB/POZ-containing protein required for early oogenesis (34Horowitz H. Berg C.A. Development. 1996; 122: 1859-1871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This gene is large and complex, encoding multiple transcripts and protein isoforms. The structure of the gene product (PsqA) and the nature of the truncated form (psq PZ fusion protein) suggest that these proteins interact directly with other proteins, including Psq isoforms, through BTB domains. However, no BTB/POZ gene family members that encode multiple protein isoforms have been reported in mammals. In the present study, we identified an alternatively spliced isoform of human BACH1 (designated BACH1t). TheBACH1t isoform encoded a truncated form of BACH1 protein that lacked the leucine zipper domain, but retained the BTB domain, CNC domain, and basic region. Although both BACH1 andBACH1t transcripts were expressed in all tissues examined, both were most abundant in testis. In transfected cells, full-length BACH1 was localized to the cytoplasm, whereas BACH1t accumulated in the nucleus. BACH1t formed hetero-oligomers with BACH1 through the BTB/POZ domains, and induced nuclear accumulation of BACH1. Thus, the subcellular localization of BACH1 is regulated by its non-DNA-binding isoform BACH1t. A human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH) was plated on 150 mm Petri dishes at a density of 5 × 104plaque-forming units/plate, and 1 × 106plaque-forming units screened with the 1.5-kb PstI fragment of human BACH1 cDNA. Duplicate filters were made from each plate and hybridized to the probe in 6× SSC and 0.25% skim milk at 55 °C overnight. Following washing under high stringency conditions, positive clones were identified and purified by two additional rounds of plaque hybridization. All isolated clones were directly sequenced using primers λgt11+ (5′-CAGCGAATTCGGTGGCGACGACTCCTGGA GC-3′) and λgt11− (5′-CAGCGAATTCTTGACACCAGACCAACTGGTA-3′), the longest positive clone insert (clone 97) subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript KS (+) (Stratagene) and both strands sequenced using an ABI PRISM cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Genomic clones encoding BACH1 were isolated by screening a commercial P1 phage human genomic library (Genome inc.) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using primers B1geno+ (5′-AGGATGCTGCTCTGGCCTT GC-3′) and B1geno− (5′-CTACTATCTTCCCTGGTGCCC-3′). Following mapping of the restriction enzyme sites of the positive clone, exon-intron boundaries were determined by Southern blot analysis and DNA sequencing. Eukaryotic expression plasmids, GFP fusion protein expression plasmids, and FLAG-tagged expression plasmids were generated by ligating BACH1 or BACH1tcDNA into BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNAI/Neo (Invitrogene), EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-NI (CLONTECH), and EcoRI and SalI sites of pCMV2 (Sigma), respectively. To construct prokaryotic expression plasmids, BACH1 and BACH1tcDNA fragments encoding the CNC-basic region were inserted into pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs). The resulting plasmids encoded the C-terminal 187 and 74 amino acids of BACH1 and BACH1t, respectively. PCR was carried out using a multiple tissue cDNA panel (CLONTECH) as template, and primers to amplify glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTT-3′ and 5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′),BACH1 (B1-E4, 5′-TTCATGG CACAACGGATAATTTCACTG-3′; and F-GSP-A, 5′-GTAACGCCAGTTCACCATCAGGAGTACT-3′), and BACH1t(B1-E4 and T-GSP-A, 5′-TGAGACTCCAGCCTTATCTTAGCAGCTA-3′). TheBACH1 genomic DNA-derived amplicon was relatively large due to the presence of an intron. PCR reactions were carried out for 24–32 cycles to ensure linearity of and products resolved on 1.5% agarose/Tris borate electrophoresis buffer gels. 5′-RACE was carried out using human testis marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH) as template and primers designed to amplify the 5′-end of BACH1t (adapter primer 1, 5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACT ATAGGGC-3′; adapter primer 2, 5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGGCGGC-3′; T-GSP-A; and T-GSP-A2, 5′-TGCAACACTACTATCTTCCCTGGTGCCC-3′). PCR was carried out according to the supplier's recommendations. The first reaction was performed using adapter primer 1 and T-GSP-A, and incubated at 94 °C for 30 s, followed by 5 cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and 72 °C for 4 min; 5 cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and 70 °C for 4 min; 20 cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and 72 °C for 4 min. Nested PCR was then performed using adapter primer 2 and T-GSP-A2 and incubated at 94 °C for 30 s, followed by 5 cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and 72 °C for 4 min, and 20 cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and 70 °C for 4 min. Nested PCR products were subcloned to pCRII (Invitrogene) plasmids and DNA sequenced. Northern blots containing multiple human tissue RNA samples were purchased fromCLONTECH. Each tissue sample contained 2 μg of poly (A)+ RNA. Blots were hybridized with32P-labeled human BACH1 or rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probes, and subsequent washings carried out as described previously (17Marini M.G. Chan K.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from a quail fibroblast cell line, QT6 transfected withBACH1, or other expression vectors as described previously (16Toki T. Itoh J. Kitazawa J. Arai K. Hatakeyama K.

An oligonucleotide containing the chicken β-globin enhancer NF-E2 site (5′-CCCGAAAGGAGCTGACTCATGCTAGCCC-3′) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Binding reactions and electrophoresis on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (PAGE) were carried out as described previously (16Toki T. Itoh J. Kitazawa J. Arai K. Hatakeyama K. Akasaka J.

Cell. 1977; 11: 95-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and seeded in six-well dishes 24 h before transfection. Following replacement of the cell culture medium with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), cells were transfected with GFP fusion, Flag-tagged protein, or nontagged protein expression vectors by lipofection using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the supplier's recommendations. Binding site selection and PCR amplification were performed as described previously (37Inaba T. Shapiro L.H. Funabiki T. Sinclair A.E. Jones B.G. Ashmun R.A. Look A.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3403-3413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 69-base pair single-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were prepared with the sequences 5′-GCGGATCCTGCAGCTCGAC(n30)GTCGACAAGCTTCTAGAGCA-3′, where n30 represents a stretch of 30 random base pairs. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared with specific forward (5′-GCGGATCCTGCAGCTCGAG-3′) and reverse primers (5′-TGCTCTAGAAGCTTGTCGAC-3′) and the double-stranded oligonucleotide pool then incubated with recombinant maltose-binding protein (MBP)-BACH1, MBP-BACH1t, or MBP-LacZ fusion proteins bound to amylose resin in binding reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) on ice for 30 min. The resins were washed three times in binding reaction buffer and boiled to release bound oligonucleotides into the supernatant. The recovered oligonucleotides were amplified by PCR with the same forward and reverse primers. After this procedure had been repeated five times, the resultant PCR products were cloned into the pCRII (Invitrogen) plasmid vector, and nucleotide sequences of the inserts determined. Cell extracts were prepared from transfected QT6 cells by lysis with ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmNaCl, 50 mm NaF, 30 mmNa2P2O7, 1% Triton X-100, 100 μm NaVO4, 100 μmphneylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min and incubated with anti-FLAG antibody M2-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitated complexes were pelleted by brief centrifugation and washed five times with lysis buffer. Washed complexes were directly applied to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blotting analysis using anti-Bach antibody (F69-1) (23Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with GFP-tagged protein or other expression vectors were incubated for 16 h on coverslips. Cells were then fixed in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde for 30 min, followed by 0.1% Triton X-100 treatment for 15 min at room temperature. Following treatment with blocking reagent (Dako) for 5 min, cells were stained with 10 μg/ml biotin-labeled M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature, washed five times in Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2 (TBS/Ca), and stained with streptavidin-conjugated R-phycoerythrin (Dako) diluted 1:20 for 10 min at room temperature. After five washes with TBS/Ca, fluorochrome-labeled cells expressing GFP fusion proteins were visualized using a microscope equipped with fluorescence optics (Nikon) and images recorded using SensiaII Fujichrome film. In an attempt to clone the human homologue of murine Bach1, we screened a human endothelial cell cDNA library under nonstringent hybridization conditions with a 1.4-kb NcoI fragment of murine Bach1 cDNA as a probe, and isolated seven positive clones. Upon Southern blotting and sequence analysis, three clones (63, 67, and 71) were found to encode human BACH1, based on sequence similarity to murine BACH1. Clone 63 contained a 2.3-kb insert that covered the entire BACH1 open reading frame (ORF). During our characterization of human BACH1, Ohira et al. (38Ohira M. Seki N. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Ohara O. Genomics. 1998; 47: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and Blouin et al. (39Blouin J.L. Duriaux Sail G. Guipponi M. Rossier C. Pappasavas M.P. Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) reported the cloning of human BACH1 cDNA and gene localization at 21q22.1. Although the cDNA clone reported by Ohira et al.contained longer 3′- and 5′-noncoding regions than clone 63, coding region sequences were completely identical. Comparison with cDNA sequences isolated by Blouin et al. showed eight coding region mismatches, resulting in two amino acid differences at positions 158 and 171 (Thr → Ser and Gly → Glu, respectively). These differences may be due to allelic variation. Northern blot analysis using a multitissue blot (CLONTECH) and a 1.5-kb PstI fragment of clone 63, including CNC-bZip region sequence, as a probe revealed the existence of a smaller sized transcript in testis, as reported by the previous studies (data not shown) (38Ohira M. Seki N. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Ohara O. Genomics. 1998; 47: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Blouin J.L. Duriaux Sail G. Guipponi M. Rossier C. Pappasavas M.P. Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To clone this molecule, we screened a human testis cDNA library using the PstI fragment of clone 63 as a probe. Southern blot and DNA sequence analysis revealed that the eight isolated clones lacked sequences encoding the C-terminal region that contained the leucine zipper domain and instead possessed a novel sequence (Fig.1, A and B). We designated the truncated sequence as BACH1t. Eleven other isolated clones obtained by the same screening method included the leucine zipper domain. As none of the isolated clones were full-length, we performed 5′-RACE using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) and primer T-GSP-A, derived from BACH1t-specific sequence, to obtain the complete BACH1t ORF. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the sequence of the 5′-noncoding region from the isolated BACH1t clones was different to previously reported sequences (38Ohira M. Seki N. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Ohara O. Genomics. 1998; 47: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Blouin J.L. Duriaux Sail G. Guipponi M. Rossier C. Pappasavas M.P. Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility that the smaller transcript was an artifact of DNA manipulation or PCR amplification, we isolated a genomic clone encoding BACH1 by PCR using the primers B1geno+ and B1geno− (Genome inc.). The gene structure and exon-intron boundaries of BACH1 were determined by Southern blot hybridization and DNA sequence analysis (Fig. 1, D and E) and revealed that all spliced sites conformed to the GT/AG rule (40Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3292) Google Scholar). Analysis of the structure of the 3′-region BACH1t-specific exons revealed four exons (exons VI, VII, VIII, and IX) located downstream of exon V, which encoded the leucine zipper domain (Fig.1 D). The 5′-noncoding region of the BACH1t clones was located 16 kb upstream of the exon that contained the translation initiation codon. A data base search for related sequences identified a human genomic sequence (GenBank™ accession no. AF124731) that covered a 108-kb region. We identified three segments within this sequence that were identical to previously reported 5′-noncoding sequences ofBACH1 (38Ohira M. Seki N. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Ohara O. Genomics. 1998; 47: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Blouin J.L. Duriaux Sail G. Guipponi M. Rossier C. Pappasavas M.P. Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and to BACH1t, indicating that the segments were alternative exon I or noncoding exon sequences for theBACH1 gene. We designated these exons described by Ohiraet al. (38Ohira M. Seki N. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Ohara O. Genomics. 1998; 47: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), Blouin et al. (39Blouin J.L. Duriaux Sail G. Guipponi M. Rossier C. Pappasavas M.P. Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and by this present study, as Ia, Ib, and Ic, respectively (Fig.1 D). To examine the expression patterns of BACH1 and BACH1t in various tissues, we performed RT-PCR analysis using combinations of a primer located in exon IV (primer B1-E4) with primers in exons V (primer F-GSP-A) or VI (primer T-GSP-A), using a multitissue cDNA panel (CLONTECH) as template. Although bothBACH1 and BACH1t were transcribed in all tissues examined, expression profiles varied depended on tissue type (Fig.2 A). Both BACH1 andBACH1t mRNAs were most abundantly expressed in the testes. Because BACH1 cDNAs have three different 5′-noncoding sequences, we analyzed the tissue specificity of these putative first exons by RT-PCR with each isomer-specific primer and a primer common to all isomers located in exon V (Fig. 2 B). Results showed that, although the alternate first exons were all transcribed, tissue-specific usage remained unclear. Northern analysis showed that the short mRNA form was highly abundant in testis, but undetectable in other tissues (38Ohira M. Seki N. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Ohara O. Genomics. 1998; 47: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Blouin J.L. Duriaux Sail G. Guipponi M. Rossier C. Pappasavas M.P. Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, the long form was of similar abundance in several tissues, but higher in spleen and leukocytes than in testis. Thus, these results appeared to be disconcordant with the PCR results (see Fig.2 A). To clarify whether BACH1 andBACH1t accounted for the long and short forms, respectively, we performed Northern blot hybridization on multitissue blots (CLONTECH) probed with an ∼300-base pairPstI/EcoRI fragment of BACH1 cDNA (clone 63), corresponding to exon V, as a BACH1-specific probe. Unexpectedly, the results showed that the short form as well as the long form was detectable in testis (Fig. 2 C). Northern blot hybridization was performed using BACH1t-specific probes, but specific bands were not detected due to high background. Although BACH1t could not be distinguished fromBACH1 by Northern blot analysis, results suggested that the long RNA form contained both BACH1 and BACH1tsequence. To examine the DNA binding properties of BACH1t, we performed gel retardation analysis using labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing NF-E2 motifs and proteins extracted from QT6 fibroblasts transfected by various combinations of BACH1, BACH1t, MAFK, and MAFG expression constructs. As shown in Fig.3, the BACH1 and small MAF heterodimer recognized the NF-E2 motif (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). In contrast to BACH1, no interaction between BACH1t and NF-E2 sites was observed, irrespective of the presence of small MAFs (Fig. 3,lanes 9 and 10). To investigate the possibility that BACH1t recognized a unique motif, we then attempted to determine the optimal binding site for BACH1t by PCR-assisted selection of binding sites. Fusion proteins of the MBP-C-terminal fragment containing the basic region of BACH1t, or the MBP-C-terminal region containing the bZip domain of BACH1 were used for five rounds of selection. Although BACH1 exhibited binding preferences toward oligonucleotides containing the TRE consensus sequence, BACH1t showed no obvious binding activity to specific DNA sequences (Fig.4). These results suggest that BACH1t is a non-DNA-binding isoform. Previous studies have shown that Bach1 BTB domains mediate protein-protein interactions (31Igarashi K. Hoshino H. Muto A. Suwabe N. Nishikawa S. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11783-11790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To clarify interactions between BACH1t and the BACH1/small MAF heterodimer, we performed coimmunoprecipitation analysis using fibroblasts transfected with FLAG-labeled BACH1t expression construct. Cotransfections were performed using various combinations of FLAG-labeled BACH1t, murine Bach1-MafK fusion protein (B1K), and Bach1 lacking BTB domain-MafK fusion protein (ΔBTB) expression vectors into fibroblasts by lipofection. When cell lysates derived from fibroblasts expressing FLAG-labeled BACH1t and B1K were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody, anti-Bach antibody (F69-1) recognized the immunoprecipitated B1K (Fig. 5, lane 3). However, after cotransfection with ΔBTB, the fusion protein was not detected (Fig. 5, lane 5). These results suggested that interaction occurred between BACH1t and the BACH1-MafK heterodimer through the BTB domains. To examine the interaction between BACH1t and BACH1 at the subcellular level, GFP-labeled BACH1 or GFP-BACH1t, BACH1t expression vectors were transfected into fibroblasts and immunofluorescence analysis performed. Unexpectedly, BACH1 and BACH1t were distributed separately in the transfected QT6 cells, with the former cytoplasmically localized and excluded from the nucleus, and the latter accumulated in the nuclei (Fig. 6 A). However, when the FLAG-MAFK expression vector was transfected to QT6, MAFK was accumulated in the nucleus as expected. To further examine the interaction between BACH1t and BACH1, we cotransfected both expression constructs into QT6 cells. As shown in Fig. 6 B (a and b), although BACH1t localization was not affected, significant accumulation of GFP-labeled BACH1 was observed in the nucleus. To exclude the possibility that this was due to the presence of the GFP label, we performed the same transfection assay using FLAG-tagged BACH1 and GFP-labeled BACH1t, and GFP-labeled BACH1 and nontagged BACH1t, with the same changes in BACH1 localization observed in each experiment (data not shown). We then performed cotransfection of expression vectors for GFP-labeled BACH1 and FLAG-labeled BACH1t lacking BTB domain (FLAG-ΔBTB BACH1t) to examine whether nuclear accumulation of BACH1 depended on the interaction through the BACH1 and BACH1t BTB domains. As expected, the nuclear accumulation of BACH1 alone was markedly reduced compared with cotransfection of GFP-labeled BACH1 and FLAG-labeled BACH1t expression vectors (Fig. 6 B (c and d)). Nevertheless, a small amount of BACH1 still accumulated in nuclei and therefore we could not exclude the possibility that BACH1 and ΔBTB BACH1t interacted with each other outside the BTB domains. Indeed, we have previously found a weak BACH1 interaction mediated through a region between the BTB and bZip domains. 2K. Igarashi, data not shown. Because the DNA binding activity of BACH1 requires the presence of small MAF proteins, we examined the subcellular localization of BACH1 in the presence of MAFK. When GFP-labeled BACH1 and FLAG-tagged MAFK were coexpressed in QT-6 fibroblasts, a small amount of BACH1 accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 6 B, e andf). However, MAFK protein, localized in the nucleus in the absence of BACH1, showed very similar distribution to BACH1 when coexpressed, such that MAFK was also more abundant in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that interactions between small MAF and BACH1 influence subcellular localization. These observations were consistent with the results obtained by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, which showed that significant NF-E2 binding activities existed in nuclear extracts when small MAF and BACH1 expression vectors were cotransfected (Fig. 3). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that more NF-E2 binding activity existed in the cytoplasm of QT-6 cells. In the present study, we described the isolation and characterization of an alternatively spliced BACH1isoform, BACH1t, that originated from the usage of a novel exon located downstream of the exon encoding the leucine zipper domain. The BACH1t isoform encoded a truncated form of BACH1 protein that lacked a leucine zipper domain. Although both BACH1 andBACH1t transcripts were abundantly expressed in human testis, expression was observed in all tissues tested. In transfected cells, BACH1 was localized to the cytoplasm, whereas BACH1t accumulated in the nucleus. BACH1t formed hetero-oligomers with BACH1 through the BTB/POZ domains and induced the nuclear accumulation of BACH1. These results suggested that BACH1t may play an important role in the control of the subcellular localization of BACH1. Characterization of human BACH1 demonstrated a complex gene structure, with multiple differentially spliced transcripts and protein isoforms. The present results and data base information indicated that the BACH1 gene has three alternate exon I or noncoding exon sequences (Fig. 1 D), and RT-PCR analysis showed that all three alternate exons were transcribed (Fig. 2 B). Such complex structures of genes encoding BTB/POZ proteins have not been described previously in mammals. Recently, Hoshino et al. found that Bach2 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm through its evolutionarily-conserved C-terminal cytoplasmic localization signal (CLS) (41Hoshino H. Kobayashi A. Yoshida M. Kudo N. Oyake T. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15370-15376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The CLS directs leptomycin B-sensitive nuclear export of reporter proteins through the binding of leptomycin B to the nuclear exporter carrier protein Crm1/exportin 1. This inhibits a nuclear export signal, leading to Crm1/exportin 1-dependent nuclear export. As oxidative stressors diminished CLS activity and induced nuclear accumulation of Bach2, the resulting rapid nuclear accumulation may allow Bach2 to regulate gene expression in response to oxidative stress. The functional significance of the CLS is reinforced by the fact that this region is highly conserved between Bach1 and Bach2, which suggests that Bach1 activity may also be regulated by a similar mechanism. In the present study, we found that BACH1 was localized cytoplasmically in transfected cells, while the naturally occurring truncated form of BACH1, which lacks the CLS, was found to be localized in the nucleus. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that BACH1t recruited BACH1 to the nucleus. It is possible that the subcellular localization of BACH1 is determined by the net balance of nuclear localization signal (NLS) and CLS activities. Thus, if one molecule of BACH1 associated with one molecule of BACH1t through their BTB domains, the resulting heterodimer would have two NLS and one CLS, such that the NLS activity would be stronger than that of the CLS. The present data also showed that small MAF protein promoted the accumulation of BACH1 in nuclei, but to a far lesser extent than compared with BACH1t (Fig. 6). Interestingly, BACH1 influenced the subcellular localization of MAFK but not of BACH1t, suggesting that there are differences in NLS activity between BACH1t and MAFK. These results indicated that there may be at least two different pathways in the control of BACH1 subcellular localization: an oxidative stress pathway and a BACH1t pathway. To our knowledge, the control of subcellular localization by heterodimer formation with an alternate isoform has not been described for other CNC family members. Recently, it was reported that the BACH1 gene localized to an ∼400-kb region on 21q22.1 (38Ohira M. Seki N. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Ohara O. Genomics. 1998; 47: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Blouin J.L. Duriaux Sail G. Guipponi M. Rossier C. Pappasavas M.P. Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), within the potential Down's syndrome-associated gene region proposed by Korenberg et al.(42Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Schipper R. Sun Z. Gonsky R. Gerwehr S. Carpenter N. Daumer C. Dignan P. Disteche C. Graham J.M. Hudgins L. McGillivray B. Miyazaki K. Ogasawara N. Park J.P. Pagon R. Pueschel S. Sack G. Say B. Schuffenhauer S. Soukup S. Yamagata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4997-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the BACH1 gene is part of theAPP-SOD1 region involved in some of the features associated with monosomy 21. Down's syndrome, the most common birth defect causing mental retardation, is characterized by specific phenotypes including subfertility or sterility and hypogonadism in males. In contrast, several women with Down's syndrome have given birth to offspring. It has been proposed that the effect of trisomy 21 on spermatogenesis and fertility is a consequence of the behavior of the extra chromosome during the meiotic prophase (43Johannisson R. Gropp A. Winking H. Coerdt W. Rehder H. Schwinger E. Hum. Genet. 1983; 63: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, an abundant expression of BACH1 and BACH1t in testis suggests that these molecules may have an important role in this tissue and raises the possibility that overexpression of BACH1 andBACH1t caused by the presence of three gene copies may lead to some aspects of the Down's phenotype, including hypogonadism or sterility. Analysis of transgenic mice with an extra copy ofBACH1 or a targeted BACH1 gene knockout may provide further information to elucidate its function and involvement in Down's syndrome and monosomy 21. Part of this work was carried out using the facilities of the Department of Molecular Genetics at Hirosaki University School of Medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1971649416,"The ileal lipid-binding protein (ILBP) is the only physiologically relevant bile acid-binding protein in the cytosol of ileocytes. To identify the bile acid-binding site(s) of ILBP, recombinant rabbit ILBP photolabeled with 3-azi- and 7-azi-derivatives of cholyltaurine was analyzed by a combination of enzymatic fragmentation, gel electrophoresis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-mass spectrometry. The attachment site of the 3-position of cholyltaurine was localized to the amino acid triplet His100-Thr101-Ser102using the photoreactive 3,3-azo-derivative of cholyltaurine. With the corresponding 7,7-azo-derivative, the attachment point of the 7-position could be localized to the C-terminal part (position 112–128) as well as to the N-terminal part suggesting more than one binding site for bile acids. By chemical modification and NMR structure of ILBP, arginine residue 122 was identified as the probable contact point for the negatively charged side chain of cholyltaurine. Consequently, bile acids bind to ILBP with the steroid nucleus deep inside the protein cavity and the negatively charged side chain near the entry portal. The combination of photoaffinity labeling, enzymatic fragmentation, MALDI-mass spectrometry, and NMR structure was successfully used to determine the topology of bile acid binding to ILBP."
https://openalex.org/W2148498956,"Recently, we described a novel chick neural transmembrane glycoprotein, which interacts with the extracellular matrix proteins tenascin-C and tenascin-R. This protein, termed CALEB, contains an epidermal growth factor-like domain and appears to be a novel member of the epidermal growth factor family of growth and differentiation factors. Here we analyze the interaction between CALEB and tenascin-C as well as tenascin-R in more detail, and we demonstrate that the central acidic peptide segment of CALEB is necessary to mediate this binding. The fibrinogen-like globe within tenascin-C or -R enables both proteins to bind to CALEB. We show that two isoforms of CALEB in chick and rodents exist that differed in their cytoplasmic segments. To begin to understand the in vivo function of CALEB and since in vitro antibody perturbation experiments indicated that CALEB might be important for neurite formation, we analyzed the expression pattern of the rat homolog of CALEB during development of retinal ganglion cells, after optic nerve lesion and during graft-assisted retinal ganglion cell axon regeneration byin situ hybridization. These investigations demonstrate that CALEB mRNA is dynamically regulated after optic nerve lesion and that this mRNA is expressed in most developing and in one-third of the few regenerating (GAP-43 expressing) retinal ganglion cells.AF292101AF292102 Recently, we described a novel chick neural transmembrane glycoprotein, which interacts with the extracellular matrix proteins tenascin-C and tenascin-R.

These interactions occur between neural cells as well as between neural cells and their extracellular surroundings, the extracellular matrix (ECM)1 which is composed of a complex agglomerate of glycoproteins and proteoglycans with diverse functions (1Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). For example, some of these glycoproteins can support or inhibit axonal growth (2Bovolenta P. Fernaud-Espinosa I. Prog. Neurobiol. ( New York ). 2000; 61: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 3Fitch M.T. Silver J. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and others may modulate the function of proteins and peptides that are synthesized and released by neurons and glial cells (4Bernfield M. Götte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). One such example of the latter is the binding of acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity (ARIA, a specific isoform of neuregulin-1) to the glycosaminoglycan portion of proteoglycans due to charged interactions with its amino-terminal portion (5Fischbach G.D. Rosen K.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 429-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The EGF-like domain of ARIA that mediates its biological activity can be released by proteolysis from the transmembrane precursor and might become tethered to the ECM of developing synapses (6Loeb J.A. Fischbach G.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Due to regulated proteolysis, the active EGF-like domain of ARIA might become accessible to the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases and induce the synthesis of acetylcholine receptor subunits at the neuromuscular junction (7Altiok N. Altiok S. Changeux J.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Gassmann M. Lemke G. Curr. Opin.

In a screen to isolate novel molecules presumed to be involved in nervous system differentiation, we identified the transmembrane protein CALEB (chicken acidic leucine-richEGF-like domain containing brain protein) (11Schumacher S. Volkmer H. Buck F. Otto A. Tárnok A. Roth S. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 895-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We described three different forms of CALEB of molecular masses of 200, 140, and 80 kDa, all of which contain an EGF-like domain, which is most similar to the EGF-like domains of the members of the EGF family of transmembrane growth and differentiation factors. In addition to the EGF-like domain, a very acidic peptide segment is present in the extracellular part of all the three CALEB components. The 140- and 200-kDa components of CALEB additionally comprise an amino acid sequence enriched in leucines and prolines and potential attachment sites for chondroitin sulfate chains. CALEB is expressed in synapse and axon-rich areas in the developing nervous system, and in vitro antibody perturbation experiments revealed a participation of CALEB in neurite formation in a permissive growth environment. CALEB is able to interact both with tenascin-C (TN-C) and tenascin-R (TN-R), members of the tenascin family of ECM proteins. These are large glycoproteins composed of a cysteine-rich region at the amino terminus, multiple EGF-like repeats of the tenascin subtype, several fibronectin type III (FNIII)-like repeats, and a single carboxyl-terminal globe similar to the globular parts of the γ and β chains of fibrinogen (12Jones F.S.

TN-C and TN-R associate to hexamers and trimers, respectively, mediated by heptad repeats within the amino-terminal cysteine-rich segment. For TN-C, several variants have been reported that are generated by alternative splicing of the FNIII-like repeats whereas TN-R contains two sites of alternative splicing. Multiple ligands have been described for TN-C and TN-R including the cell surface proteins F11, axonin-1, neurofascin, RPTPβ/ζ, the β2 subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels, and different types of integrins (16Brümmendorf T.

Furthermore, both TN-C and TN-R can bind to other ECM glycoproteins and proteoglycans such as neurocan, phosphacan (a specific isoform of RPTPβ/ζ), versican, brevican, fibronectin, as well as to heparin (26Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Motoyuki S. Heinegard D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 27Chung C.Y.

Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Many functional features have been ascribed to TN-C and TN-R in the nervous system. For example, TN-C and TN-R contain both adhesive and counteradhesive sites for cell attachment. TN-C is able to stimulate neurite outgrowth (30Fischer D. Brown-Lüdi M. Schulthess T. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and TN-R has been shown to enhance neurite growth mediated by other substrates and to modulate the cellular receptor usage that is responsible for mediating the outgrowth effect (31Nörenberg U. Hubert M. Brümmendorf T. Tárnok A. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Zacharias U. Nörenberg U. Rathjen F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24357-24365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our previous investigations demonstrated that CALEB can interact with TN-C and TN-R, but it has not been defined which regions of CALEB or the tenascins are required (11Schumacher S. Volkmer H. Buck F. Otto A. Tárnok A. Roth S. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 895-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we report that the acidic peptide segment of CALEB is necessary for binding to TN-C and TN-R. Furthermore, we show that the fibrinogen-like module of TN-C and TN-R is responsible for the interaction with CALEB. We have investigated whether other isoforms of CALEB are generated in the chick, and we compared these sequences with mammalian homologs. In all species examined, two isoforms of CALEB exist, which are generated by alternative pre-mRNA splicing. These splicing events lead to two different cytoplasmic tails of CALEB. Since our previous in vitro investigations suggested a participation of CALEB in neurite formation, we examined the expression pattern of the rat homolog of CALEB during development, after optic nerve lesion, and during graft-assisted axon regeneration in the retina of adult rats. CALEB constructs C1, C2, and C3 were generated using PCR and the CALEB cDNA (11Schumacher S. Volkmer H. Buck F. Otto A. Tárnok A. Roth S. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 895-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For construct C1, C2, and C3, the upstream primers 5′-cacactagtcgagatcatcgacgttgactactac-3′, 5′-cacactagtggccgatttctaccccaccacctcc-3′, and 5′-cacactagtgccggagaacagcagtgagtgccg-3′ were used, respectively. The downstream primer in all cases was 5′-cacctcgaggtcggtgacgatggcctcgcagcg-3′. PCR products were introduced into vector pDELF-1 (33Brümmendorf T. Plagge A. Treubert U. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 319-342PubMed Google Scholar) using SpeI and XhoI sites. mCALEB/NGC constructs mC2 and mC3 were generated using mCALEB/NGC cDNA and PCR. For construct mC2 and mC3 the upstream primers were 5′-cacactagtgtctgatttctaccccaccacatcc-3′and 5′-cacactagttctcctgccctctcaaaagcctgg-3′, respectively. The downstream primer was 5′-cacctcgaggtccgtgatgatggactcacagcg-3′ in both cases. PCR products were subcloned into vector pDELF-1 using SpeI- andXhoI-cloning sites. The putative mouse homolog of CALEB was obtained by screening a cDNA library of P20 mouse brain (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) using a probe composed of the sequence that encodes the acidic peptide segment, the EGF-like domain, and the transmembrane region of CALEB. Different independent cDNA clones were obtained, which cover most of the coding sequence but lacked the 5′-end. 5′-RACE technology using the “5′-RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends, Version 2.0” (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the following modification was employed to establish the 5′-end. 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA for cDNA synthesis was used instead of total RNA, and the “gene-specific primer” was 5′-cacactagtcactgcagccgatgcctctag-3′. PCR products of four independent reactions were cloned and sequenced. The presumed rat homolog of CALEB was amplified by RT-PCR from poly(A)+ RNA prepared from rat brain using the upstream primers 5′-cacgaattctgggcagcttcccggggtcaccag-3′ and 5′-cacgaattcaagccgcgcgcaccggcaacagc-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-cacgaattctgcccgagaggagacaacagtccttc-3′, all of which were derived from the corresponding mouse sequence. Several independent amplification products were cloned and sequenced. A cDNA clone encoding CALEBb, the isoform not described so far, was obtained by screening an E16 chick brain library (34Plagge A. Brümmendorf T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 122: 215-225Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) using a probe, which is composed of the sequence encoding the EGF-like domain, the transmembrane region, and the cytoplasmic domain of CALEB. TN-C and TN-R were isolated from urea extracts of adult chicken brains by immunoaffinity chromatography as described using mAb M1 and mAb 23-13, respectively (35Chiquet M. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1937-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 36Rathjen F.G. Wolff J.M. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Development. 1991; 113: 151-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed with 7% acrylamide under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Western blots of CALEB components were analyzed using mAb 4/1 to CALEB. Recombinant chick TN-C variants (TN-C/190, FF−, EFb−, and EFn−) were cloned as detailed elsewhere and expressed in stably transfected HT 1080 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) (28Fischer D. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Bernasconi C. Chiquet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3378-3384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Fischer D. Brown-Lüdi M. Schulthess T. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The encoded recombinant proteins were purified from the conditioned medium of the HT 1080 cells. The chick TN-R construct EFn− (TN-R) corresponding to EFn−(TN-C) was cloned into the vector pFLAG-CMV-1 (Sigma) and expressed in COS7 cells (American Type Culture Collection). For this, the cysteine-rich region of TN-R together with a His tag was amplified using PCR with the primers 5′-gcgaattcacatcaccatcaccatcacgaggggggcctggccaactgc-3′ and 5′-gggagatctacggcacgactccaggct-3′ and cloned into pFLAG-CMV-1 usingEcoRI and BglII. In the next step the fibrinogen-like domain of TN-R was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-gggagatctggtggccgtgtcttt-3′ and 5′-cgcggatcctcagagctgtagggaccg-3′ and introduced into this modified vector using BglII andBamHI. Recombinant protein was purified from conditioned medium using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The purity of proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Purified TN-C and TN-R as well as the different recombinant proteins were coupled to red fluorescent microspheres of 0.5 μm diameter according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bioclean: Duke Scientific Corp., Palo Alto, CA). Proteins to be coupled were used in a concentration range of 20–50 μg/ml. The coupling reactions were performed in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at 24 °C or overnight at 4 °C. Residual binding sites were blocked with bovine serum albumin. For affinity chromatography using recombinant proteins TNC/EFb− and TNC/EFn− immobilized to CNBr-activated Sepharose, embryonic day 20 (E20) chick brains were homogenized in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, with protease inhibitor mixture). The 10,000 rpm pellet was solubilized in homogenization buffer containing 2% Chaps. After centrifugation (100,000 × g), half the volume of the supernatant was passed over the TNC/EFn−and the TNC/EFb− columns, respectively. Both columns were washed with homogenization buffer containing 2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Chaps. Columns were eluted with the same buffer without cations but with 10 mm EDTA. COS7 cells were transiently transfected using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (16Brümmendorf T. Hubert M. Treubert U. Leuschner R. Tárnok A. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 711-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 38Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). At day 1 after transfection, the cells were trypsinized, washed, and replated on collagen-coated 8-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International Corp., Naperville, IL). At day 2 after transfection, the supernatant was removed and replaced by 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. 1 μl of fluorescent microspheres was added per well. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed, fixed, and stained for CALEB construct expression by indirect immunofluorescence using rabbit anti-human IgG, Fcγ fragment (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Binding reactions were analyzed with a confocal microscope (MRC1000, Bio-Rad or Zeiss LSM, Oberkochen, Germany). Surgery and preparation of retinal explants were performed exactly as described (39Jung M. Petrausch B. Stuermer C.A.O. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 116-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To generate a cRNA probe, a 200-base pair fragment of mCALEB was amplified by PCR using the mCALEB cDNA with the primers 5′-cacgaattcttggcaaagaagacagtgagcatg-3′ and 5′-cacggatccccagctactgccacaacggc-3′. The generation of cRNA and the procedure of the in situ hybridization were carried out as detailed (39Jung M. Petrausch B. Stuermer C.A.O. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 116-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For double in situ hybridizations, the hybridization solution contained both a DIG- and a fluorescein-labeled riboprobe (150 ng/ml each). The DIG-labeled probe is detected first using anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase reaction developed with BM purple. After the washing steps, the alkaline phosphatase is inactivated by heat (80 °C for 20 min). The fluorescein-labeled riboprobe was then detected by incubation with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody to fluorescein followed by a color reaction with Fast Red (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In a screening procedure applied to characterize novel binding proteins of known axon-associated glycoproteins, we identified CALEB due to its interaction with the ECM glycoproteins TN-C and TN-R (11Schumacher S. Volkmer H. Buck F. Otto A. Tárnok A. Roth S. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 895-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Further independent assays confirmed the binding between CALEB and TN-C or TN-R. To map regions of CALEB that might be responsible for these interactions, we used different deletion constructs of the extracellular portion of CALEB cloned into the pDELF-1 vector (Fig. 1). This vector is a derivative of plasmid pSG5, which contains the SV40 early promoter/origin of replication and carries the signal peptide sequence of the neural cell adhesion molecule F11, a multiple cloning site, and the CH2 and CH3 domains of human IgG1 followed by the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attachment signal of F11 (33Brümmendorf T. Plagge A. Treubert U. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 319-342PubMed Google Scholar). The signal peptide of F11 results in a strong cell surface expression of CALEB domains, and the constant domains of IgG1 allowed us to compare the expression efficiency of the different CALEB constructs in COS7 cells by indirect immunofluorescence. Construct C1 contains amino acid residues 286 (EIIDV) to 476 (AIVTD) of CALEB (11Schumacher S. Volkmer H. Buck F. Otto A. Tárnok A. Roth S. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 895-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and therefore composes the acidic peptide segment and the EGF-like domain. In addition, it contains at its amino terminus a potential tyrosine sulfation motif, which might be important for binding TN-C or TN-R. Construct C2 lacks this potential tyrosine sulfation motif, starts with amino acid 338 of CALEB (ADFYP), and ends at position 476 as construct C1. Construct C3 is composed of the amino acid sequence starting from residue 411 (PENSS) and ending with residue 476 of CALEB. This construct encodes the EGF-like domain but not the acidic peptide segment of CALEB. These vectors were transfected into COS7 cells which, after 2 days of cultivation, were incubated with red fluorescent microspheres coated with purified TN-C or TN-R, respectively. Transfected COS7 cells were identified using an antibody to the Fcγ portion of human IgG1, followed by a secondary antibody, which contains a green fluorochrome. Red/yellow fluorescence indicates binding of the microspheres to the transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 1, microspheres coated with TN-C bind to COS7 cells transfected with CALEB construct C1 (Fig. 1 A), or with construct C2 (Fig. 1 C), but do not bind to COS7 cells transfected with construct C3 (Fig.1 D). No binding was observed to untransfected COS7 cells or to COS7 cells transfected with the pDELF plasmid on which the IgG1 domains without CALEB sequences are expressed (Fig. 1 B). These observations further demonstrate the specificity of the assay. The same results were obtained when using microspheres coated with TN-R instead of TN-C (Fig. 2 F and data not shown). These results demonstrate that the acidic peptide segment of CALEB is required for binding between CALEB and the tenascins, whereas the EGF-like domain of CALEB alone or the potential tyrosine sulfation motif is not important for this interaction.Figure 2Binding of recombinant TN-C (A–E) or TN-R (F–H) mutant polypeptides to CALEB fusion protein expressed on COS7 cells. In these experiments COS7 cells were transfected with CALEB construct C1 (see Fig. 1). The transfected cells were incubated with red fluorescent microspheres loaded with different recombinant proteins encoded by TN-C or TN-R constructs (see E and H). Areveals that recombinant TN-C (TN-C/190) binds to CALEB-transfected COS7 cells. Neither protein derived from construct FF− of TN-C (B), which lacks the FNIII-like repeats as well as the fibrinogen-like module (Fg), nor from the construct EFb− of TN-C (C), which does not contain both the EGF-like segment and the fibrinogen-like module, bind to CALEB-transfected cells. However, recombinant protein encoded by construct EFn− of TN-C, which contains the cysteine-rich domain (Cys-rich) as well as the fibrinogen-like module, but not the EGF-like repeats or FNIII-like repeats, does bind to COS7 cells that were transfected with CALEB construct C1 (D). Fand G show the binding of purified TN-R and the polypeptide derived from construct EFn− of TN-R, respectively. Both interact with COS7 cells transfected with CALEB construct C1. The results are summarized in E and H. Bars, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TN-C and TN-R are large ECM glycoproteins composed of a cysteine-rich region at the amino terminus followed by multiple EGF-like and FNIII-like domains. A fibrinogen-like module is located at the carboxyl terminus (12Jones F.S. Jones P.L. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 235-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 13Faissner A. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14Chiquet-Ehrismann R.

To identify domains of TN-C and TN-R responsible for binding to CALEB, we expressed CALEB construct C1 (Fig. 1 E), which does bind purified TN-C and TN-R, on COS7 cells. We then coupled proteins derived from different TN-C constructs (Fig. 2 E) onto red fluorescent microspheres, and we incubated the transfected COS7 cells with these microspheres. Microspheres coated with recombinant TN-C/190, the smallest occurring splice variant of TN-C in chick lacking the FNIII-like domains A–D, are able to bind to COS7 cells that had been transfected with CALEB construct C1 (Fig. 2 A). Microspheres coated with protein FF− (TN-C), which lacks both the FNIII-like domains as well as the fibrinogen-like module of TN-C, do not bind to COS7 cells transfected with CALEB construct C1 (Fig. 2 B). The same result was observed for microspheres coated with EFb−(TN-C), which composes the cysteine-rich region and the FNIII-like domains 1–5 and 6–8 of TN-C but lacks the fibrinogen-like module (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, recombinant protein derived from a construct that encodes only the cysteine-rich region and the fibrinogen-like globe of TN-C (EFn− (TN-C); Fig.2 E) is able to mediate the binding to transfected COS7 cells, when coupled to red fluorescent microspheres (Fig.2 D). On the basis of these findings using TN-C mutant polypeptides, we generated a similar deletion mutant of TN-R containing the cysteine-rich segment and the fibrinogen-like module, and we coated microspheres with the recombinant protein (EFn− (TN-R); Fig. 2 H). These beads were found to bind to COS7 cells that were transfected with CALEB construct C1 (Fig. 2 G). In summary, our investigations indicate that the fibrinogen-like module of either TN-C or TN-R mediates the interaction with the acidic peptide segment of CALEB. To confirm the importance of the fibrinogen-like globe in binding of TN-R or TN-C to CALEB, we prepared affinity columns with the recombinant polypeptides EFn− or EFb− of TN-C mentioned above. Equal amounts of a detergent extract from E20 chick brain as indicated by Coomassie Blue-stained gels in Fig.3 A were passed over both columns (load). After washing, the columns were eluted with 10 mm EDTA, and the resulting fractions (load (L), flow-through (F), wash (W), and eluate (E)) were separated on SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with mAb 4/1 to CALEB (Fig. 3 B). Two immunopositive bands (arrows) characteristic for CALEB from embryonic brain could be detected in the load. The flow-through of column EFn− (TN-C) contained a small amount of immunopositive CALEB bands, whereas most could be detected in the eluate. In contrast no CALEB components were observed in the eluate of the column EFb− (TN-C) but were present in the flow-through. The EDTA elution step followed by 1 m NaCl did not result in elution of any additional CALEB components (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the fibrinogen-like domain of TN-C or TN-R mediates the interaction to CALEB and support the binding studies using COS7 cells. Several members of the EGF family of differentiation factors such as the neuregulins are generated as multiple isoforms. We have therefore extensively screened for alternative forms of CALEB in cDNA libraries of embryonic chicken brain. By using a probe that encodes the EGF-like domain, the transmembrane region, and a part of the cytoplasmic domain of CALEB, we detected two isoforms of CALEB, designated as a and b forms, which differed in their cytoplasmic tails. The a form is identical to our original published sequence of CALEB (11Schumacher S. Volkmer H. Buck F. Otto A. Tárnok A. Roth S. Rathjen F.G. J.

This molecule belongs to the cadherin family of cell-cell adhesion receptors, for which molecular details of homotypic interactions are still lacking. In this study, a recombinant fragment encompassing the four N-terminal modules of VE-cadherin (VE-EC1–4) was shown to associate, in solution, as a stable Ca2+-dependent oligomeric structure. Cross-linking experiments combined with mass spectrometry demonstrated that this oligomer is a hexamer. Gel filtration chromatography experiments and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses revealed the existence of an equilibrium between the hexameric and monomeric species of VE-EC1–4. The concentration at which 50% of VE-EC1–4 is in its hexameric form was estimated as 1 μm. The dimensions of the hexamer, measured by cryoelectron microscopy to be 233 ± 10 × 77 ± 7 Å, are comparable to the thickness of adherens endothelial cell-cell junctions. Altogether, the results allow us to propose a novel homotypic interaction model for the class II VE-cadherin, in which six molecules of cadherin form a hexamer.

The junctions between endothelial cells play a crucial role in controlling this traffic. An adhesion receptor belonging to the cadherin superfamily, vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin)1 (1Lampugnani M.G. Resnati M. Raiteri M. Pigott R. Pisacane A. Houen G. Ruco L.P. Dejana E. J.

In fact, opening of VE-cadherin-mediated endothelial cell contacts was suggested to be a crucial step in neutrophil extravasation (5Del Maschio A. Zanetti A. Corada M. Rival Y. Ruco L.

VE-cadherin is also involved in determining the vascular architecture since recent studies demonstrated that targeted inactivation of VE-cadherin in transgenic mice leads to embryonic mortality due to severe vasculogenic defects (8Gory-Faure S.

Cadherins are Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion receptors that are able to bind cells together by means of homotypic interactions. In these interactions, only identical cadherin types interact. Consequently, cells expressing various cadherins segregate into like groups when mixed. Due to this selective cell-cell recognition property, cadherins are important regulators of morphogenesis (10Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar) by promoting clustering of cells with identical phenotypes. The extracellular part of cadherins consists of five homologous protein modules designated EC1–EC5, numbered from the N terminus to the C terminus. Various lines of evidence have implicated the N-terminal module EC1 in determining homotypic binding specificity (11Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M. Cell. 1990; 61: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 12Blaschuk O.W. Sullivan R. David S. Pouliot Y. Dev.

Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 16Ozawa M. Engel J. Kemler R. Cell. 1990; 63: 1033-1038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and is required for homotypic interactions (17Takeichi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains of cadherins are homologous and interact either with β- or γ-catenins in a mutually exclusive fashion. By connecting cadherins to the actin-based cytoskeleton, binding of α-catenin to β- or γ-catenins (18Kemler R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar) strengthens cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. Comparison of cadherin sequences provides evidence that VE-cadherin is structurally different from class I cadherins, which include N- and E-cadherins. For example, the EC1 module of VE-cadherin lacks the sequence motif HAV (1Lampugnani M.G. Resnati M. Raiteri M. Pigott R. Pisacane A. Houen G. Ruco L.P. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1511-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) involved in the adhesion activity of class I cadherins (11Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M. Cell. 1990; 61: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 12Blaschuk O.W. Sullivan R. David S. Pouliot Y. Dev. Biol. 1990; 139: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Consequently, VE-cadherin was classified in the class II cadherin group (19Tanihara H. Sano K. Heimark R.L. St. John T. Suzuki S. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), inferring that it might have particular adhesive properties. The elucidation of how the extracellular region of VE-cadherin assembles is fundamental to understanding the mechanism of cell-cell adhesion in the endothelium and to clarifying the process by which VE-cadherin modulates the transmigration of leukocytes. In this study, we focus on the behavior in solution of VE-EC1–4, a fragment consisting of the four N-terminal modules of VE-cadherin. The molecular determinants at the basis of homotypic interactions and organization of cadherins in the adherent structures at cell-cell junctions have been studied by analyzing the behavior in solution of cadherin fragments and by determining their high resolution structures. Some of the results are conflicting. For example, the E-cadherin N-terminal module (E-EC1) remains monomeric in solution (20Koch A.W. Pokutta S. Lustig A. Engel J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7697-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Overduin M. Tong K.I. Kay C.M. Ikura M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 173-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the equivalent fragment of N-cadherin (N-EC1) self-associates as dimers (14Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), suggesting that the homoassociation mechanism is different according to the cadherin type. Comparison of the crystal structures from various cadherin fragments is also ambiguous. Thus, the N-EC1 crystal structure revealed the presence of parallel dimer interfaces (cis-dimers) and antiparallel alignments (trans-dimers) (14Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). It was suggested that both types of association reflect the interactions occurring between cadherins at the cell surface. cis-Dimers were proposed to mimic the alignment of two molecules emerging from the same cell surface, whereastrans-dimers may correspond to molecules protruding from opposing cell surfaces. The presence of these parallel and antiparallel dimers inspired Shapiro et al. to build a zipper model for the molecular organization of cadherins at the cell surface, in which each extracellular module contributes to lateral dimerization (14Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 22Patel D.J. Gumbiner B.M. Nature. 1995; 374: 306-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Until now, no direct evidence for lateral dimerization of the EC2–EC5 modules has been presented. This model is in conflict with conclusions drawn from the crystal structures of the two module fragments of E-cadherin (E-EC1–2) (23Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar,24Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and N-cadherin (N-EC1–2) (25Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In fact, both EC1–2 fragments adopt twisted X structures maintained by a network of calcium-mediated interactions that fixes the orientation between the EC1 and EC2 modules (26Koch A.W. Bozic D. Pertz O. Engel J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Formation of the antiparallel dimers was not observed in the X-shaped E-EC1–2 and N-EC1–2 structures. Studies to elucidate mechanisms involved in homotypic interactions have essentially been performed on class I cadherins and more specifically on murine E- and N-cadherins or on Xenopus C-cadherin. In this study, we present results concerning the mechanism of homotypic adhesion for the class II VE-cadherin. We show that the recombinant fragment including the four N-terminal modules of VE-cadherin self-associates in a Ca2+-dependent hexameric structure. Its visualization by electron microscopy allows us to constrain models for homotypic VE-cadherin associations. Two oligonucleotides (oligonucleotide A, 5′-TATACAT ATG GAT TGG ATT TGG AAC CAG ATG CAC-3′; and B, 5′-CTCGAATTC TCA CTC CGG GGC ATT GTC ATT CTC ATC-3′) were synthesized and used as primers to produce, by polymerase chain reaction technology, a cDNA fragment containing the sequence from nucleotides 166 to 1458 and encoding VE-cadherin (Asp1–Glu431). The DNA template was isolated from Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue transformed with a full-length VE-cadherin cDNA inserted into the pBluescript vector (27Breviario F. Caveda L. Corada M. Martin-Padura I. Navarro P. Golay J. Introna M. Gulino D. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides A and B were designed to generate a 5′-Nde I restriction site containing an ATG start codon (boldface in sequence above) and a 3′-Eco RI restriction site (underlined) positioned immediately after an in-frame TGA stop codon (italic). The polymerase chain reaction fragments were ligated with plasmid pCR-Script (pCR-ScriptTM Amp SK(+) cloning kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and then inserted, after digestion with Nde I and Eco RI, into the pET-30b+ expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting pET-VE-cadherin vector contained the DNA sequences coding for VE-cadherin (amino acids 1–431) fused to an N-terminal methionine. Prior to the expression of the protein, the cDNA constructs were sequenced to verify that mutations had not arisen during the polymerase chain reaction. To obtain the fragment designated VE-EC1–4 (Asp1–Glu431),E. coli host strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with the pET-VE-cadherin plasmid and grown in Lennox broth base containing 30 mg/liter kanamycin. Production of the recombinant fragment was performed according to the supplier's instructions (Novagen, Madison, WI) using a 100 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction for 4 h. The cells were then harvested and resuspended in 40 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm EDTA and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete tablets, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, France). After sonication, the insoluble proteins were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with 0.5m urea and 0.5% Triton X-100 dissolved in Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The insoluble proteins were then dissolved in Tris-HCl containing 8 m urea and chromatographed on an anion-exchange Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Orsay, France) using a NaCl gradient (0–300 mm). Fractions, eluted at a NaCl concentration of 120 mm, were pooled and concentrated to 3 mg/ml prior to the refolding according to the following method. Purified urea-containing fractions were diluted in renaturing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) at 4 °C) so that the final concentrations of protein and urea were in the ranges of 20–50 μg/ml and 0.1–0.2 m, respectively. To facilitate the refolding of the protein, CaCl2 was then added at a 5 mmfinal concentration, and the solution was incubated overnight without stirring at 4 °C before addition of NaCl (150 mm final concentration). After concentration to 2 mg/ml, the protein solution was filtered (0.22 μm) and eluted on a Superdex S200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to eliminate aspecific aggregates. The absorbance coefficients for the VE-EC1–4 fragments, estimated from the amino acid composition using molar absorption coefficients of 5540m−1 cm−1for tryptophan residues and 1280m−1 cm−1for tyrosine residues (20Koch A.W. Pokutta S. Lustig A. Engel J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7697-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), were evaluated to 45,800m−1 cm−1. Multimers of VE-EC1–4 were fractionated on the Superdex S200 analytical gel filtration column (10,000–500,000 fractionation range) using a biologic chromatography system (Bio-Rad, Ivry/Seine, France). A molecular mass calibration curve was established using the following standard globular proteins: ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa; hydrodynamic radius (R h) = 20.9 Å), ovalbumin (43 kDa;R h = 30.5 Å), albumin (67 kDa;R h = 35.5 Å), aldolase (158 kDa;R h = 48.1 Å), catalase (232 kDa;R h = 52.2 Å), and ferritin (440 kDa;R h = 61 Å) (29Le Maire M. Aggerbeck L.P. Monteilhet C. Andersen J.P. Moller J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A plot of (−log K av)1/2 versus R h for the globular proteins previously mentioned allowed us to determine the hydrodynamic radius of the various VE-EC1–4 forms observed on chromatograms (K av = (V e −V o)/(V t− V o), where V e is the elution volume for the protein, V o is the column void volume, and V t is the total bed volume (24 ml)). A knowledge of the R h associated with the sedimentation coefficient allowed an accurate determination of the VE-EC1–4 monomer and multimer molecular masses (see “Analytical Ultracentrifugation”). The time required to reach equilibrium between the monomeric and hexameric forms, after dilution of VE-EC1–4 from 45 to 2 μm, was evaluated at 20 and 4 °C. The hexameric form rapidly decreased initially and stabilized after 30 h at 20 °C and after >2 weeks at 4 °C. The equilibrium between the monomeric (M) and hexameric (H) forms of VE-EC1–4 can be described as 6M ↔ H, with an apparent dissociation constant K D(H) = [M]6/[H], where [M] and [H] correspond to the concentrations of the monomer and hexamer, respectively. To estimateK D(H), serial dilutions of VE-EC1–4 were prepared from the 37.8 μm stock solution and equilibrated at 20 °C for periods longer than 48 h. 100 μl of each VE-EC1–4 dilution were injected onto the Superdex S200 column using a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and 20 mm Tris (pH 8.5) running buffer containing 200 mm NaCl and 5 mmCaCl2. To minimize hexamer dissociation during chromatographic runs, experiments were performed at 4 °C. To verify the stability of the hexamer during chromatographic runs, fractions containing the multimer were reinjected onto the column immediately after the first separation. No significant dissociation was noticed for VE-EC1–4 loading concentrations ranging 0.4 from 45 μm, despite dilution occurring during the chromatographic process. Thus, the very slow dissociation rate at 4 °C allowed us to estimate the percentage of the monomeric (% M) and hexameric (% H) forms from chromatographic profiles. Practically, they were calculated, from their respective chromatographic peaks, after fitting and integration with two gaussian curves. From these percentages, [M] and [H] were deduced using the following equations: [H] = (% H)C i/6) × 100 and [M] = (% M)C i/100, where C i corresponds to the total concentration of VE-EC1–4. Then, from the straight line ln[H] = f(ln[M]), K D(H)could be deduced. The unit μm+5 forK D(H) is dictated by the equationK D(H) = [M]6/[H]. This unusual unit of measurement for K D(H)does not allow direct comparison with previous results established for the monomer ↔ dimer equilibrium of E-cadherin. For comparison, we calculated the C 50% values for each equilibrium. (C 50% corresponds to the concentration at which 50% of the fragments by weight are in the multimeric form.) C 50% can be deduced fromK D using the following equation:C 50% = (2/n 1/n−1)(K D)1/n−1, where n corresponds to the degree of association. Whenn is equal to 2, the C 50% value corresponds to the K D for a monomer ↔ dimer equilibrium. In contrast, when n is equal to 6, theC 50% value becomes equal to 1.4 ×5KD for a monomer ↔ hexamer equilibrium. Mass spectra of the recombinant fragment VE-EC1–4, cross-linked or not, were obtained with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (VoyagerElite Xl, Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. Aliquots of 0.5 μl of the protein solution and 0.5 μl of the matrix solution were mixed on a stainless steel sample plate and dried in the air prior to mass spectrometry analysis. External calibration was performed with bovine serum albumin (m/z 66452; Sigma). All experiments were performed using a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid prepared in a 50% (v/v) solution of acetonitrile and aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The accuracy of MALDI molecular mass determinations is between 0.01 and 0.05%. The recombinant fragment VE-EC1–4 was partially cross-linked usingN-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDAC; Sigma) or ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) (EGS). The molar ratio between the recombinant fragment and the cross-linker reagent was adjusted by varying the concentrations of the cross-linking reagents from 1 to 3 mm and from 0.1 to 3 mm for EDAC and EGS, respectively. In fact, these experiments were performed at 20 °C in MES (pH 7.0) for 2 h and in 2 mm Tris (pH 8.5) for 15 min for EDAC and EGS, respectively; and the concentration of VE-EC1–4 was maintained at 110 μm. Electrophoresis analyses were then performed on 4–15% gradient Phast gels (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the oligomeric state of VE-EC1–4, the fragment was cross-linked with EGS used at a 3 mm final concentration in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.2) for 30 min at room temperature under gentle stirring. Prior to the reaction, the cross-linker was solubilized in Me2SO at a concentration of 50 mm to minimize pH and calcium concentration changes and to avoid addition of a large volume. To maintain the oligomeric state of the fragment, the concentrations of VE-EC1–4 and calcium were adjusted to 20 μm and 5 mm, respectively. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by adding 100 mmglycine and cooling the reaction flask in ice. Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed using a Beckman Model XL-A analytical centrifuge. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 20 °C in 1.2- or 0.3-cm path length double-sector cells with quartz windows and run at 42,000 rpm. The recombinant fragment was diluted at 1.2 and 26.2 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2 5 days before the sedimentation velocity experiments. Sample volumes of 400 μl were centrifuged, and radial scans were taken at 12-min intervals. Data analysis was performed using the computer programs SVEDBERG (30Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and DCDT (31Stafford III, W.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), provided by J. S. Philo and W. F. Stafford, respectively. The partial specific volume (v) for VE-EC1–4 (0.733 ml/g), the density (ρ, 1.0059 g/ml) and the viscosity (η, 1.022 centipoise) of the buffer were calculated according to the program Sedinterp, supplied by D.

By combining the sedimentation coefficient (S) and the hydrodynamic radius (R h) of VE-EC1–4 determined by ultracentrifugation and gel filtration chromatography experiments, the molar mass (m) of the multimer could be calculated using the following equation: S = m(1 − ρv)/6πNηR h, whereN is Avogadro's number. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in 1.2-cm double- and six-channel centerpieces at 4500, 6000, and 12,000 rpm at VE-EC1–4 concentrations of 3, 12.5, 25, and 40 μm. After 24–48 h of centrifugation, scans were compared at 2-h intervals to ensure that equilibrium had been reached. An experimental base line was determined at 42,000 rpm. Data of the absorbance (A) at 277 nm as a function of radial position (r) were analyzed considering a reversible self-associating system between monomers and hexamers using the Multifit analysis program (Version 4.01, Beckman Instruments). An apparent association constant (K app; in absorbance units) was obtained from the set of 12 profiles. For each profile, A 1(r 0), the absorbance for monomers at the radial positionr 0 (the first point of each data set), andE, the residual base line, were fitted as follows:A =A 1(r 0)exp(m 1(1 − ρv)ω2(r 2 −r 02)/2RT) +A 1(r 0)6 K appexp(6m 1(1 − ρv)ω2(r 2 −r 02)/2RT) + E, where m 1 is the molecular mass of the monomer, ω is the angular velocity in s−1,R is 8.31 J·K−1·mol−1(the gas constant), and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The dissociation constant K D(H) was calculated from K app using an extinction coefficient of 48,843 cm−1m−1. Negatively stained specimens of 0.05 mg/ml VE-EC1–4 were prepared using uranyl acetate by the mica floatation technique and observed with a Philips CM200 electron microscope operating at 120 kV. Frozen hydrated specimens of 0.4 mg/ml VE-EC1–4 were prepared on a holey carbon film supported on a 400-mesh copper grid. A 4-μl sample of the specimen was deposited onto the grid; the excess was blotted with filter paper for 1–2 s; and the grid was then rapidly plunged into liquid ethane at −175 °C. Specimens were observed at a temperature of approximately −180 °C using a Gatan 626 cryo-holder with a Phillips CM200 electron microscope operating at 200 kV. Images were obtained under low dose conditions (<10 electrons/Å2) at a nominal magnification of ×66,000. The images were recorded on Kodak SO163 electron image films and developed in full-strength D19 developer for 12 min at room temperature. The magnification was calibrated in independent experiments using the 23-Å pitch of tobacco mosaic virus. Micrographs were digitized using an Optronics microdensitometer with a step size of 25 mm, which corresponds to a pixel size of 3.69 Å for the specimen, taking into account the corrected microscope magnification of ×67,700. The length and width of the images of 100 particles were measured on a Silicon Graphics computer using the Semper 6 Plus image analysis package. Individual particles were selected, masked, and normalized by subtracting the mean and any density gradient present and normalizing the S.D. The particles were centered and aligned by cross-correlation procedures prior to averaging. The variation between particle images suggests that they are in different orientations about their long axis, so internal details are lost in the averaged image, but the overall shape is clear. A recombinant fragment of human VE-cadherin encompassing the four extracellular N-terminal modules (EC1–EC4) was expressed in E. coli in sufficient amounts for biophysical and biochemical studies (Fig.1). The boundary of this fragment, designated VE-EC1–4, was essentially defined according to the domain organization proposed by Tanihara et al. (19Tanihara H. Sano K. Heimark R.L. St. John T. Suzuki S. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To avoid cross-linking and the associated problems of insolubility, the fifth module of VE-cadherin (EC5), the only module that may contain disulfide bridges, was excluded (Fig. 1). Moreover, to increase solubility of the fragment, the hydrophobic amino acid Phe432 in the C-terminal region of the EC4 module was also deleted. Consequently, the fragment starts immediately after the 47-amino acid long signal peptide at Asp1 and ends at Glu431 of the mature VE-cadherin molecule. A foreign methionine was added as a start signal at the N terminus of the fragment. After purification of VE-EC1–4, a single 49-kDa band was observed by SDS electrophoresis. N-terminal sequencing (Fig. 1) gave a unique signal, confirming the purity and integrity of the extremity of the molecule. Moreover, the molecular mass of the purified fragment (48,948 Da), obtained by MALDI mass spectrometry, matches the calculated one (48,941 Da), indicating the absence of any internal cleavage within the molecule. Circular dichroic measurements attested that VE-EC1–4 possesses a large fraction of β-sheets and indicated that it is correctly folded (data not shown). The capacity of the recombinant fragment to self-associate was evaluated by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2). Purified VE-EC1–4 was first injected at a concentration of 1 μmonto an analytical gel filtration column (Fig. 2 A). Two peaks with elution volumes equal to 12.4 ± 0.1 ml (peak I;R h = 68 ± 1 Å) and 15.74 ± 0.05 ml (peak II; R h = 38.6 ± 0.8 Å) were detected on the chromatograms. SDS electrophoresis analysis of the chromatographic fractions corresponding to elution peaks I and II showed the presence of a unique 49-kDa band (Fig. 2 B). This attested that both elution peaks correspond to the VE-EC1–4 fragment, thus excluding the possibility that peak II was due to a contaminating protein. It can be predicted that peaks I and II contain the oligomeric and monomeric VE-EC1–4 forms, respectively. To determine the oligomeric state of VE-EC1–4 in solution, it was cross-linked using the homobifunctional cross-linking reagents EGS (which reacts covalently with amino groups) and EDAC (which reacts covalently with amino and carbo"

A new mutation, N16D, was of particular interest. Asn-16 is not seen in the crystal structure of the AraC dimerization domain determined in the absence of arabinose, because the N-terminal arm 18 residues are disordered, but in the presence of arabinose, residues 7–18 fold over the arabinose and make many interactions with it. In this state Asn-16 lies near two positively charged amino acids, Lys-43 and Arg-99. We propose that the introduction of the negatively charged aspartic residue at position 16 creates a charge-charge interaction network among Asp-16, Lys-43, and Arg-99 that holds the arm to the dimerization domain even in the absence of arabinose. This frees the DNA-binding domains and allows them to bind cis toI1-I2 half-sites and activate transcription. Mutating the two positively charged residues to alanines individually and collectively decreased or eliminated the constitutivity created by the N16D mutation.

Mutating the two positively charged residues to alanines individually and collectively decreased or eliminated the constitutivity created by the N16D mutation. The regulatory protein of the l-arabinose operon inEscherichia coli is thought to function by what is called the light switch mechanism (1Saviola B. Seabold R. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Reed W.L. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the absence of arabinose, the two DNA-binding domains of the dimeric AraC molecule are held not only by the eight amino acid peptide linkers between the dimerization domain and the DNA-binding domain but also by the N-terminal arms from the dimerization domains that bind to the DNA-binding domains. Even though each of these two connections may be flexible (3Eustance R.J. Bustos S.A. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 330-338PubMed Google Scholar), their combination restricts the orientations freely available to the DNA-binding domains. This restriction makes it energetically disadvantageous for the two domains to contact the adjacent I1 andI2 half-sites but rather easy for the two domains to contact the nonadjacent half-sites I1 and O2 and form a DNA loop, represented in Fig.1 (4Seabold R. Schleif R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The situation changes upon the binding of arabinose. The binding of arabinose in the dimerization domains favors binding of the arms to the dimerization domains rather than the DNA-binding domains. This relieves the constraints on the DNA-binding domains and allows them to bind to the adjacent direct repeat I1 and I2 half-sites. This mode of DNA binding allows AraC to activate RNA polymerase for transcription from pBAD (5Hendrickson W. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 611-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Hendrickson W. Schleif R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). According to the light switch mechanism, the binding of arabinose to the dimerization domain is normally required for the N-terminal arms to prefer to bind to the dimerization domains rather than the DNA-binding domains (1Saviola B. Seabold R. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Reed W.L. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This model predicts the existence of two kinds of mutations in AraC that would allow it to activate transcription in the absence of arabinose. In the first type, the interactions between the arms and DNA-binding domains are weakened by mutations in either the arm or domain. In the second type, the arms are kept from the DNA-binding domains as a result of strengthened interactions between the arms and the dimerization domains that lead the arm to bind to the dimerization domain even in the absence of arabinose. Because either type of mutation frees the DNA-binding domains in the absence of arabinose, AraC activates the pBAD promoter in the absence of arabinose, that is, it becomes constitutive. Although a sizeable number of constitutive mutations in AraC have been isolated (10Englesberg E. Irr J. Power J. Lee N. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 946-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Irr J. Englesberg E. Genetics. 1970; 65: 27-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wallace R. Constitutive Mutations in AraC.Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Santa Barbara, CA1982Google Scholar), no mutations of the second type have been identified. Although it is quite possible that among the known constitutive mutations, some do have the effect of strengthening the arm-dimerization domain interaction, none stands out as obviously being of this type as judged from simple inspection of the structure of the dimerization domain that has been determined in the presence of arabinose (13Soisson S.M. MacDougall-Shackleton B. Schleif R.F. Wolberger C. Science. 1997; 276: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We have therefore sought additional constitutive mutations in AraC in hopes of finding mutations possessing a clear mechanistic basis and that would either support or refute the light switch mechanism. For mutagenesis, plasmid pWR03 (2Reed W.L. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) containing the entire AraC coding region was transformed into mutator cells (endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17 supE44 relA1 lac mutD5 mutS mutT Tn10:Tetr ) (E. coli XL1-Red competent cells; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described by Stratagene. The mutagenized plasmids were harvested via resin-based mini-prep (Wizard Plus DNA Miniprep purification system;Promega) and transformed into SH321 (F−ΔaraC-leu1022 Δlac74 galK− Strr thi1) (14Hahn S. Dunn T. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Constitutive mutant candidates were selected based on their abilities to grow on minimal arabinose-fucose plates containing 0.1% arabinose and 0.2% fucose. Colonies that grew up in 2 days were further tested by in vivo arabinose isomerase assay. Cells were grown in M10 minimal salts medium plus 0.4% glycerol, 10 μg/ml thiamine, 0.02%l-leucine, and 0.2% casamino acids (15Schleif R.F. Wensink P.C. Practical Methods in Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, New York1981Crossref Google Scholar). When cells reached an A 600 of ∼0.8, they were harvested and assayed for their arabinose isomerase activities as described (15Schleif R.F. Wensink P.C. Practical Methods in Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, New York1981Crossref Google Scholar). When induction by arabinose was necessary, 0.2% arabinose was added to the culture 45 min before the assay. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Stratagene QuickChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The following reagents were mixed together: 125 ng each of the two primers, 50 ng of parental plasmid template, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP mix, 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 1 μl of Pfu DNA polymerase (2.5 units/μl; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and dH2O to a final volume of 50 μl. All the other steps were as described by the Stratagene manual. Induction of the arabinose operon is inhibited by the l-arabinose analogue,d-fucose (10Englesberg E. Irr J. Power J. Lee N. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 946-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wallace R. Constitutive Mutations in AraC.Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Santa Barbara, CA1982Google Scholar), but mutants can be isolated that are resistant to this inhibition by selecting for growth on medium where the only carbon sources are arabinose and fucose. Such mutants are frequently found to be constitutive (10Englesberg E. Irr J. Power J. Lee N. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 946-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Beverin S. Sheppard D.E. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 79-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To isolate constitutive mutants, we therefore passed a plasmid coding for the AraC gene through a mutator E. coli strain XL1-Red, which is deficient in three of the primary DNA repair pathways. After accumulating mutations during propagation in the mutator cells, the plasmid was transformed into an AraC− strain. Constitutive mutants, present at a frequency of ∼0.2% among the transformants, were selected on the basis of their abilities to grow on minimal arabinose-fucose plates. The arabinose isomerase activities of the candidates were then assayed after growth in minimal medium in the absence of arabinose, and those with isomerase levels at least 3-fold above the wild type basal level were sequenced. Four different mutations were found, all lying in the N-terminal arm of AraC. They were L9K, S14P, N16D, and L19P. Of these, L19P was isolated twice, and N16D was isolated three times; L9K and S14P were isolated only once. Constitutive mutations at positions 9, 14, and 19 have been isolated before (1Saviola B. Seabold R. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Wallace R. Constitutive Mutations in AraC.Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Santa Barbara, CA1982Google Scholar). The mutation N16D was new, however. Arabinose isomerase assay showed that, in the absence of arabinose, the N16D mutant activates the pBAD promoter 67%, as well as wild type AraC induces in the presence of arabinose. By comparison, wild type AraC induces the pBAD promoter less than 1% of the full induction level in the absence of arabinose. In the structure of the AraC dimerization domain determined in the absence of arabinose, residues 1–18 are not seen, because the arms are disordered. In the structure determined in the presence of arabinose, however, the arms starting from residue 7 are visible and are seen to fold over the bound sugar. Asn-16 is close to two positively charged amino acids, Lys-43 and Arg-99 (Fig. 2). The closest distances between the side chains of the three residues are as follows: Asn-16—Lys-43, 3.5 Å; Asn-16—Arg-99, 2.0 Å; and Lys-43—Arg-99, 5.6 Å. It is very likely that changing residue 16 from asparagine to negatively charged aspartic acid creates a charge-charge interaction network between it and Lys-43 and Arg-99. We expect that, with the additional binding energy provided by this interaction, the arms are held to the dimerization domains most of the time even in the absence of arabinose, and this leads the protein to behave as though arabinose were present. The hypothesis that in the N16D mutant the arms are held to dimerization domains through charge-charge interactions was tested by mutating the two positively charged amino acids Lys-43 and Arg-99 to alanines individually and collectively. If the electrostatic interactions increasing the strength of the binding of the arm to the core of the dimerization domain cause AraC to behave constitutively, then the phenotypes of the double or triple mutants should change accordingly. Alanine substitutions of Lys-43 and Arg-99 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The abilities of the mutants to activate thepBAD promoter were examined by the arabinose isomerase assay both in the absence and in the presence of arabinose. Table I shows that changing either Lys-43 or Arg-99 to alanine in N16D AraC resulted in a partial loss of the constitutivity and that when both were changed to alanines, AraC no longer displayed any constitutive behavior. The triple mutant, N16D,K43A,R99A, behaved almost the same as the wild type AraC. As shown in Table I, the alanine substitutions did not affect the activation ability of either the wild type AraC or N16D in the presence of arabinose. The results are consistent with the idea that mutation N16D creates stronger arm-dimerization domain interactions and that these make AraC constitutive.Table IActivating abilities of AraC on pBAD promoterAraC proteinActivityMinus ArabinosePlus ArabinoseWT404690N16D27404590N16D, K43A6104650N16D, R99A2603490N16D, K43A, R99A902150K43A205140R99A305240K43A, R99A704320Activation by N16D AraC and the alanine substitution mutants was measured from the p BAD promoter with the arabinose isomerase assay. Open table in a new tab Activation by N16D AraC and the alanine substitution mutants was measured from the p BAD promoter with the arabinose isomerase assay. We searched for and found constitutive mutations in AraC protein. One of the mutations found, N16D, was not only new, but its mechanism of action can be understood and is consistent with the light switch mechanism for AraC action. In the three-dimensional structure of the AraC dimerization domain, Asn-16 lies very close to the two positively charged residues Lys-43 and Arg-99. Presumably then, a salt-bridge triad arises among Asp-16, Lys-43, and Arg-99, and the extra energy provided by this electrostatic network holds the arms to the dimerization domain even in the absence of arabinose. Studies by both x-ray crystallography and NMR show that in almost all cases, the structural changes generated by changing the charge of a surface-exposed amino acid residue are confined to the immediate vicinity of the mutation (17Horovitz A. Serrano L. Avron B. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 1031-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 18Serrano L. Horovitz A. Avron B. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7142-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We expect this to be true of N16D, as well, although our attempts to crystallize the dimerization domain bearing the N16D mutation yielded only a crystal form with a space group that is unsuitable for structural determination. Under similar conditions wild type AraC dimerization domain also prefers to form these same unsuitable crystals but also occasionally forms crystallographically useful crystals (13Soisson S.M. MacDougall-Shackleton B. Schleif R.F. Wolberger C. Science. 1997; 276: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We think it likely that the salt bridges formed in the N16D mutant significantly stabilize the arm-domain interactions. Although some report that single salt bridges on the surfaces of protein contribute little stability (17Horovitz A. Serrano L. Avron B. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 1031-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 18Serrano L. Horovitz A. Avron B. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R.

Honig B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), it is worth pointing out that some of the cited studies involved engineered ion pairs that may not have been in configurations necessary for optimal salt bridges. Moreover, when salt bridges involve three charged amino acids rather than two, cooperativity ought to add to the stabilizing effects (17Horovitz A. Serrano L. Avron B. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 1031-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). For example, on the surface of barnase are two exposed salt bridges between the C-terminal Arg-110 and aspartic residues at positions 8 and 12 in the first α helix of the protein. The contribution to the stability of the protein by the salt bridge between Asp-12 and Arg-110 is 1.25 kcal/mol, whereas that of the salt bridge between Asp-8 and Arg-110 is 0.98 kcal/mol. The energy of each is reduced by 0.77 kcal/mol when the other is absent, indicating that the two salt bridges are coupled. Each of the two residues, Lys-43 and Arg-99, contributes to the constitutivity of the N16D mutant as shown by the fact that changing either of the two positively charged residues to alanine substantially reduced the level of constitutivity. Thus, a triad similar to the one found in barnase could form, and coupling between the two salt bridges would take place. The resulting stabilizing force is large enough for the arms to prefer binding to the core of the dimerization domain rather than to the DNA-binding domain or not binding to either domain."

A striking consequence is the inversion of the long (L) and short (S) components of the genome relative to each other (6Roizman B. Sears A.E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 2231-2295Google Scholar). Homologous recombination also appears to be enhanced by the HSV-11 replication machinery. It has been suggested that the replication process generates strand breaks that will initiate recombination (4Dutch R.E. Bianchi V. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3084-3089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological role of homologous recombination during the infectious cycle has not been studied. One might, however, speculate that it is involved in repair or editing of replication intermediates. It might also constitute one way to promote circularization of linear viral genomes containing extensive directly repeated sequences at the ends (7Messer L.I. Timbury M.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1979; 45: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). A recent study, on the other hand, demonstrates that circularization of the guinea pig cytomegalovirus genome is likely to proceed by a different mechanism (8McVoy M.A. Nixon D.E. Adler S.P. J.

Three distinct pathways involved in the repair of double-stranded breaks have been detected in eukaryotic cells. One of these, referred to as nonhomologous end joining, involves Ku and the DNA-dependent protein kinase (9Chu G. J. Biol.

Inside cells, it appears to yield products that contain an altered DNA sequence at the site of fusion. More recently, an in vitro system that depends on DNA ligase IV/Xrcc4 and requires Ku70, Ku86, and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase has been developed. This system produces accurate and efficient ligation of complementary ends (10Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). A second alternative is nonconservative homologous recombination using a single strand annealing mechanism. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an endonuclease formed by the rad10and rad1 gene products is strictly required (11Ivanov E.L. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2245-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologues are the ERCC1 and ERCC4 gene products. The loss of the ERCC1 gene in mammalian cells results in an increase of recombination-dependent deletions at tandemly repeated sequences and an increased instability of genomes (12Melton D. Ketchen A.M. Núñez F. Bonatti-Abbondandolo S. Abbondandolo A. Squires S. Johnson R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sargent R.G. Rolig R.L. Kilburn A.E. Adair G.M. Wilson J.H. Nairns R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13122-13127Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). XP-F cells that are devoid of the ERCC4 gene product show an impaired capacity to circularize linear DNA molecules with short direct repeats, but they can efficiently recombine long homologous sequences (14Yao X.-D. Matecic M. Elias P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The third pathway is homologous recombination, which in S. cerevisiae depends on the rad51 gene product and the other members of the rad52 epistasis group (15Petes T.D. Malone R.E. Symington L.S. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome Dynamics, Protein Synthesis and Energetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 407-521Google Scholar). The mammalian homologue, HsRad51, appears to be essential for viability of cells (16Lim D.S. Hasty P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7133-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 17Tsuzuki T. Fujii Y. Sakumi K. Tominaga Y. Nakao K. Sekiguchi M. Matsuhiro Y. Yoshimura Y. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6236-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). It is believed to act primarily in recombination repair during the late S-G2 phase of the cell cycle (18Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Rad51 protein increases the frequency of recombination events and the resistance of mammalian cells to ionizing radiation (19Vispe S. Cazaux C. Lesca C. Defais M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2859-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It has been observed that homologous recombination in mammalian cells is dependent on the length of the homologous regions (14Yao X.-D. Matecic M. Elias P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Roth D.B. Wilson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3355-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Rubnitz J. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 4: 2253-2258Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Ancient viruses that establish life-long infections in the host are likely to interact with the cellular pathways that control the replication and integrity of cellular chromosomes. We have performed a series of investigations aimed at identifying interactions between the DNA metabolism of herpes simplex virus type 1 and the infected cell. For example, we found that inhibition of topoisomerase II by ICRF-193 prevented efficient replication of HSV-1, indicating that decatenation of replication products was an early and essential step during virus replication (22Hammarsten O. Yao X. Elias P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4523-4529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also noted that direct repeats of the HSV-1 terminal a sequence were able to promote nonconservative homologous recombination not dependent on XP-F/ERCC4 (14Yao X.-D. Matecic M. Elias P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, linear DNA molecules containing the HSV-1 origin of replication, oriS, as well as directly repeated sequences replicated as efficiently as the corresponding circular molecule in BHK cells (14Yao X.-D. Matecic M. Elias P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now investigated if viral DNA synthesis or viral gene products are required for recombination to occur. We have also looked at the efficiency of homologous recombination in different cell types. A new assay that allowed us to monitor homologous recombination in the absence of HSV-1 DNA replication was developed. Briefly, a plasmid that supports the expression of luciferase was redesigned to contain the middle portion of the coding sequence as direct repeats. The repeated sequences were separated by a noncoding sequence derived from bacteriophage λ. Linear plasmid DNA was produced by restriction enzyme cleavage in the λ sequence and introduced by lipofection into cells. The correct open reading frame could now be restored by homologous recombination. This assay, referred to as recombination-dependent expression of luciferase, was combined with a described previously assay for oriS-dependent amplification of recombination products to monitor how a HSV-1 infection and the genetic background of cells affect the efficiency of homologous recombination. The results show that homologous recombination is mechanistically independent of HSV-1 but dependent on the properties of the cell. Interestingly, the small amounts of recombination products that are formed are very efficiently amplified by the HSV-1 DNA synthesis machinery, suggesting a structural or temporal coupling between these processes. BHK cells (clone 13 ATCC CCL 10) were grown in Glasgow modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 10% newborn calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. COS-7 (ATCC CRL 1651) cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. MEF p53 −/− was from Klas Wiman (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm). Wild type MEFs were from Maria Enge (Department of Medical Biochemistry, Göteborg University). Balb/c 3T3 cells (ATCC CLL-163) and Balb/c 3T3.SV-T2 cells (ATCC CCL 163–1) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 4.5 g/liter glucose. HSV-1 Glasgow strain 17 syn+ was propagated at 37 °C and the viral stocks were prepared as described previously (14Yao X.-D. Matecic M. Elias P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hammarsten O. Yao X. Elias P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4523-4529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HSV-1 tsK and tsS were obtained from Dr. Nigel Stow (MRC Virology Unit, Institute of Virology, Glasgow, United Kingdom). Titration of all viruses was performed on BHK cells. Phosphonoacetic acid, luciferin, and camptothecin were from Sigma. A series of plasmids containing repeated sequences has been described (Fig. 1; Refs. 2Dutch R.E. Bruckner R.C. Mocarski E.S. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 277-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 14Yao X.-D. Matecic M. Elias P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, the directly repeated sequences are separated by a spacer of λ DNA derived from the plasmid pRD105 (2Dutch R.E. Bruckner R.C. Mocarski E.S. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 277-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yao X.-D. Matecic M. Elias P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were designated p2aLORI, p2bLORI, and p2hLORI, depending on the source of the repeated sequences (Fig. 1 A). The repeated sequences were the 317-bpa sequence from the HSV-1 genome, a 341-bp sequence from BHK cells, and a 161-bp sequence of human origin. Another set of plasmids without the λ DNA spacer, p2aORI and p2bORI, was described previously (14Yao X.-D. Matecic M. Elias P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pBORI lacks repeated sequences (14Yao X.-D. Matecic M. Elias P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HSV-1 origin of replication, oriS, was included to allow transient replication in cells superinfected with HSV-1. Another series of plasmids, p2aLSV and p2hLSV, contains repeated sequences as well as the SV40 origin of replication. A new series of plasmids was designed to measure recombination-dependent expression of luciferase (Fig.1 B). The functional gene was divided into three parts starting from the 5′-end and ending with the SV40 polyadenylation signal. They were called LucI (612 bp), LucII (776 bp), and LucIII (1222 bp). These sequences were cloned into an expression vector, pCMV19K, from which E1B19K and the SV40 origin were removed byBamHI and EcoRI cleavage (23White E. Cipani R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9886-9890Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). HSV-1 oriS was cloned downstream of the luciferase gene. pXY1 contains the intact luciferase gene. In pXY2, LucII was duplicated, and the two copies were separated by a λ sequence. The restriction fragments Fr1, Fr2, and Fr3 contain only parts of the luciferase gene (Fig. 1). Fr1 and Fr2 were from pXY2. Fr3 was derived from a different plasmid. It contains LucII and LucIII but lacks the CMV promotor. The DNA molecules were used either as circular DNA or as linear DNA produced by restriction enzyme cleavage as shown in Fig. 1. Circular or linear plasmid DNA was introduced into cells using liposomes. BHK and COS-7 cells were transfected as described previously (14Yao X.-D. Matecic M. Elias P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hammarsten O. Yao X. Elias P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4523-4529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3T3 cells and MEFs were transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUS as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). 0.25–1 μg of DNA was mixed with 50 μl of Optimem and 3 μl of Plus reagent. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Then 2 μl of LipofectAMINE and 50 μl of Opti-MEM were added. The 105-μl suspension of liposomes was used for the transfection of cells together with 400 μl of Opti-MEM in 21-mm dishes. The frequency of transfection was determined using the plasmid pCMVβ (CLONTECH) encoding β-galactosidase. The transfected cells were stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside. For each monolayer, the frequency of cells expressing β-galactosidase was determined at several locations in the wells. An average of the values obtained for each well was used to construct Table II.Table IITransfection frequencyCellsTransfected cells 2-aCells transfected with 0.8 μg of circular or linear pCMVβ plasmid DNA.

Open table in a new tab Subconfluent monolayers of cells were transfected by circular or linear plasmid DNA using liposomes for 4 h. Superinfection with HSV-1 (5 pfu/cells) or cotransfection with a collection of expression plasmids encoding the seven viral replication genes provided the necessary trans-acting factors (24Stow N.D. Hammarsten O. Arbuckle M.I. Elias P. Virology. 1993; 196: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Total DNA was harvested either 18 h after superinfection or 48 h following cotransfection with expression plasmids. DNA was digested with restriction enzymes as indicated and subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. The enzymeDpnI was used to cleave input DNA. The DNA was blotted onto Hybond-H+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by the manufacturer. Hybridization was performed using randomly labeled pUC 19 probes (Megaprime; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This probe recognizes the oriS-containing plasmids as well as the pE series of expression plasmids. Probes from the fragments a, b, and h were used in the experiment shown in Fig. 2. The plasmid pXY2 was used as a substrate for recombination. The middle part of the luciferase gene, LucII, was present as direct repeats separated by a λ DNA sequence (Fig.1 B). Homologous recombination between the LucII repeats will create an intact luciferase gene, which can be monitored by a luciferase assay. Confluent or subconfluent monolayers of BHK cells in 15-mm dishes and Balb/c 3T3 or 3T3.SV-T2 cells in 21-mm dishes were lipofected as indicated. The cells were harvested after 24 h. The monolayers were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. They were suspended in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of the same solution. This suspension was repeatedly frozen and thawed three times. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugaton at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Luciferase activity was measured by taking 20 μl of the supernatant mixed with 0.36 ml of a buffer containing 5 mm ATP, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8. Then 100 μl of a solution containing 0.4 mmluciferase, 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, and 0.4 mm dithiothreitol was added. Luciferase activity was measured in a LUMAT LB 9501 luminometer. The results were expressed as relative luciferase units/μg of protein. Protein concentration of the extract was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. To verify the authenticity of luciferase, Western blotting was performed using an anti-luciferase antibody. BHK cells in 15-mm dishes were lipofected with plasmids containing the entire luciferase gene or parts thereof. After 24 h post-transfection, the monolayers were washed and suspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were collected by low speed centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and 40 μl of 2× loading buffer (50 μm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mdithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol) and boiled for 3 min. The samples were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoretic transfer was done onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.). The immunoreaction of the blotted membrane was performed by using Bio-Rad Immun-Blot assay kit (goat anti-rabbit IgG, alkaline phosphatase) and an anti-luciferase antibody (Promega). Monolayers of cells in 21-mm dishes were transfected with liposomes containing either circular or linear forms of the plasmid pCMVβ as indicated. The transfected cells were incubated for 20 h and subsequently stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside as described by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). The total number of blue cells expressing β-galactosidase and the number of apoptotic shrunken blue cells were determined by light microscopy. Apoptosis was also measured by staining cells with annexin V coupled to green fluorescent protein using the ApoAlertTM kit from CLONTECH. Balb/c 3T3 cells were grown on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes. The cells were lipofected at 80% confluency with 1.6 μg of circular or linear pCMVβ. The growth medium was collected at 8 h post-transfection, and the monolayers were rinsed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The nonadherent cells were collected by centrifugation. The adherent and nonadherent cells were stained separately by annexin V-EFGP as described by the manufacturer. The cells were washed after staining. The nonadherent cells were suspended in 20 μl of phosphate-buffered glycerol prior to fluorescence microscopy. To study mechanisms of recombination in mammalian cells, we have developed a transient replication assay to monitor the circularization of linear DNA (14Yao X.-D. Matecic M. Elias P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed plasmids that contained directly repeated sequences that in some instances were separated by a sequence of λ DNA. Furthermore, origins of DNA replication from either HSV-1 or SV40 were included (Fig. 1 A). Linear DNA was produced by restriction enzyme cleavage between the direct repeats. DNA was introduced into cells by lipofection. The use of calcium phosphate precipitation resulted in significant degradation of the transfected DNA, and the products of recombination were much more heterogenous (results not shown). In the initial phase of this investigation, we chose to work with BHK cells, since they have been widely used to study HSV-1 replication. Properties of BHK cells that are pertinent for the interpretation of our results are reviewed under “Discussion.” We initially examined the fate of transfected linear DNA in infected and uninfected BHK cells (Fig. 2). Total DNA was isolated from cells undergoing a transient replication experiment and cleaved with EcoRI prior to agarose gel electrophoresis. The two bands in the middle of the autoradiograph represent linear input DNA. Imprecise nonhomologous end joining or homologous recombination produces different products (14Yao X.-D. Matecic M. Elias P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecules formed by end joining are found in a slightly diffuse band in the upper part of the autoradiograph. The molecules formed by homologous recombination have lost one of the repeats as well as the intervening λ sequence. They are represented by a distinct band in the lower part of the autoradiograph. We estimate that in the absence of a virus infection less than 1% of the total amount of transfected DNA was converted to circular molecules by homologous recombination in BHK cells (Fig. 2). However, in infected cells much larger amounts of the recombination products were seen using the plasmids p2aLORI and p2bLORI (Fig. 2). In the presence of phosphonoacetate, there was no accumulation of recombined DNA, demonstrating that the recombination products were amplified by the HSV-1 replication machinery. Homologous recombination was sequence-independent inasmuch as the virala sequence and the b sequence derived from BHK DNA gave rise to similar amounts of recombination products. We also noted that the plasmid p2hLORI supported homologous recombination to a lesser extent. In this instance, a significant amount of DNA recombined by nonhomologous end joining was seen (Fig. 2). This finding is in agreement with a previous observation that homologous recombination that occurs in the absence of the XP-F/ERCC4 gene product is dependent on the length of the homologous sequences (14Yao X.-D. Matecic M. Elias P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that homologous recombination might assist in the assembly of productive replication forks, thereby serving as a link between replication and recombination (25Kogoma T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 212-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). However, we have transfected linear DNA without a viral origin of DNA replication but still containing directly repeated a sequences into BHK cells. We found that this DNA did not serve as a template for origin-independent DNA synthesis (results not shown). The finding indicates that the recombination process does not generate structures that can assemble the HSV-1 replisome. We have asked if the replication machineries assembled at either HSV-1 oriS or SV 40 origins of replication in BHK cells and COS-7 cells amplify recombination products differently. DNA was isolated from the cells and treated with DpnI to completely digest the unreplicated DNA (Fig. 3). When circular DNA was used in the transfection experiment only small amounts of recombination products were produced. Linear DNA supported circularization by the end joining pathway as well as by homologous recombination. Although the two replication systems are structurally completely distinct they appear to amplify molecules produced by end joining and homologous recombination in similar ways. The results argue that the outcome of the recombination reaction is not governed by the virus. To further elucidate the interdependence of DNA replication and recombination, we devised an assay that allowed us to measure recombination in the absence of DNA synthesis. A recombination substrate, pXY2, was made in which a luciferase gene was altered to contain directly repeated coding sequences separated by a λ DNA spacer (Fig. 1 B). Control DNA contained either a complete intact luciferase gene, pXY1, or different parts of the luciferase genes as in Fr1, Fr2, and Fr3 (Fig. 1 B). First, we introduced linear DNA molecules into BHK cells (Fig.4 A). We found that none of the DNA fragments containing incomplete luciferase genes supported luciferase expression when transfected into BHK cells (Fig.4 A). The linear form of the plasmid pXY1 containing the complete gene readily supported luciferase expression. We also found that linear pXY2 containing the disrupted luciferase resulted in high level expression of luciferase in BHK cells (Fig. 4 A). This demonstrates that homologous recombination efficiently can restore the proper open reading frame for luciferase. We then looked at luciferase expression from circular and linear forms of the plasmids pXY1 and pXY2 (Figs. 4 B and 7 A). Again luciferase was efficiently produced in cells transfected with circular and linear pXY1. Linear pXY2 also supported luciferase expression. Circular pXY2, on the other hand, gave rise to very little luciferase. Apparently, a double strand break greatly stimulated homologous recombination, leading to restoration of an intact luciferase gene. We could also verify using SDS gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with an anti-luciferase antibody that the molecular weights of luciferase enzyme produced from the plasmids pXY1 and pXY2 were identical (Fig.4 C). Moreover, similar amounts of luciferase were synthesized in cells transfected with linear pXY1 and pXY2 (Fig.4 C). Together, these results argue that homologous recombination is able to circularize linear DNA very efficiently in BHK cells.Figure 7Recombination-dependent expression of luciferase is cell type dependent. Circular and linear DNA was transfected into BHK cells (A), 3T3 cells (B), 3T3.SV-T2 cells (C), and MEF p53 −/− cells (D). Cell lysates were made 24 h after transfection, and the luciferase activity was measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It was noted in the previous paragraph that only a very small part of the transfected DNA was circularized by homologous recombination in the absence of DNA synthesis (Fig. 2). We now observe that a linear intact and a linear disrupted luciferase gene support the production of approximately the same amount of active enzyme. When combined, these observations argue that a subset of DNA molecules may have a high probability of simultaneously participating in homologous recombination, DNA replication, and transcription. An assay based on gene expression rather than DNA amplification allowed us to examine more directly the effects of viral DNA synthesis on homologous recombination. We compared luciferase expression from linear pXY1 and pXY2 in the presence and absence of HSV-1 (Fig.5). We found that superinfection with HSV-1 did not significantly affect recombination-dependent expression of luciferase. We also noticed that the inhibitor of viral DNA synthesis, phosphonoacetate, did not inhibit recombination-dependent expression of luciferase (Fig.5). We also examined the effects of viral gene expression using HSV-1 tsK and tsS strains at the nonpermissive temperature. The results demonstrated that recombination-dependent expression of luciferase was n"

The recently solved human BCKD structure at 2.7 Å showed that the two TDP-binding pockets are located at the interfaces between α and β′ subunits and between α′ and β subunits. In the present study, we show that the E76A-β′ mutation results in complete inactivation of BCKD. The result supports the catalytic role of the invariant Glu-76-β′ residue in increasing basicity of the N-4′ amino group during the proton abstraction from the C-2 atom on the thiazolium ring. A substitution of His-146-β′ with Ala also renders the enzyme completely inactive. The data are consistent with binding of the α-ketoacid substrate by this residue based on the Pseudomonas BCKD structure. Alterations in Asn-222-α, Tyr-224-α, or Glu-193-α, which coordinates to the Mg2+ ion, result in an inactive enzyme (E193A-α) or a mutant BCKD with markedly higher K m for TDP and a reduced level of the bound cofactor (Y224A-α and N222S-α). Arg-114-α, Arg-220-α, and His-291-α interact with TDP by directly binding to phosphate oxygens of the cofactor. We show that natural mutations of these residues in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) patients (R114W-α and R220W-α) or site-directed mutagenesis (H291A-α) also result in an inactive or partially active enzyme, respectively. Another MSUD mutation (T166M-α), which affects one of the residues that coordinate to the K+ ion on the α subunit, also causes inactivation of the enzyme and an attenuated ability to bind TDP. In addition, fluorescence measurements establish that Trp-136-β in human BCKD is the residue quenched by TDP binding. Thus, our results define the functional roles of key amino acid residues in human BCKD and provide a structural basis for MSUD.

BCKD is the E1 component of the macromolecular BCKD complex (M r = 4 × 106), which comprises multiple copies of BCKD or E1, dihydrolipoyl acyltransferase (E2), dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), a specific kinase, and a specific phosphatase (3Yeaman S.J.

In the oxidative decarboxylation reaction, BCKD or the E1 component catalyzes the TDP-mediated decarboxylation of a branched-chain α-ketoacid to produce an enamine-TDP, with concomitant reduction of the lipoamide moiety covalently attached to E2. This is followed by the reaction of enamine-TDP with the reduced dihydrolipoamide, which results in anS-acyldihydrolipoamide. E2 catalyzes the transfer of the acyl group from the tetrahedral intermediate to CoA to give rise to a branched-chain acyl-CoA. The nonconjugated dihydrolipoamide is subsequently reoxidized by E3, which is a flavoprotein, with NAD+ as the ultimate electron acceptor. The last step resets the cycle for oxidative decarboxylation of the branched-chain α-ketoacid. Mammalian BCKD is regulated by a reversible phosphorylation (inactivation)/dephosphorylation (activation) cycle under different hormonal and dietary stimuli (4Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Kedishvili N.Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In patients with heritable maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), activity of the BCKD complex is deficient. This results in the accumulation of α-ketoacids with severe clinical consequences including often fatal ketoacidosis, neurological derangement and mental retardation (2Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York2000: 1971-2006Google Scholar). To understand the structure and function of BCKD as well as the biochemical basis for MSUD, we have recently solved the three-dimensional structure of the human enzyme at 2.7-Å resolution (5Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.L. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 211-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The human BCKD structure reveals the presence of two TDP-binding pockets, with each formed at the interface between the α and β′ subunits or between the α′ and β subunits (5Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.L. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 211-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This topology is similar to the BCKD from Pseudomonas putida (6Ævarsson A. Seger K. Turley S. Sokatch J.R. Hol W.G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and is equivalent to the homodimeric transketolase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where its two TDP-binding sites are formed at the head-to-tail interfaces between the two identical subunits (7Lindqvist Y.

The cofactor binding fold in these TDP-dependent enzymes is located at the interface between the α domain of one subunit and the γ domain of the other. The physiological significance in doubling of the TDP-binding sites compared with transketolase and BCKD is not apparent at present. In addition, two novel K+ ion-binding sites in human BCKD, one on the α subunit and one on the β subunit, were identified. MSUD mutations that affect residues in the TDP-binding and the K+ ion-binding sites or residues involved in subunit assembly of BCKD have been described. These findings have provided a basis for understanding structure and function of human BCKD as well as how these properties are affected by naturally occurring MSUD mutations. In this report, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis on residues in the TDP-binding and K+ ion-binding sites as well as residues that are affected in MSUD patients. Both the wild-type and mutant BCKD proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli in the presence of cotransformed chaperonins GroEL and GroES. These properly assembled heterotetramers were characterized for their kinetic parameters and their ability to bind cofactor TDP. The results confirm the roles of key amino acid residues in catalysis as well as cofactor and metal ion binding as implicated by the crystal structure of human BCKD. Moreover, the study depicts the conservation and divergence among TDP-dependent enzymes, which catalyze the cofactor-mediated oxidative or nonoxidative decarboxylation reaction. The Altered Site in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to introduce desired mutations into the cDNA for the α or the β subunit. Detailed protocols for the mutant vector construction and subsequent mutagenesis were described previously (13Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Chinsky J.M. Wynn R.M. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 954-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides for the desired mutations and the β-lactamase repair primer were annealed to the single-stranded form of pAlter-α or pAlter-β vector. After the second strand synthesis and two rounds of ampicillin selection, clones harboring the correct mutations were isolated for plasmid preparation. DNA segments containing the mutations were used for cassette replacements of the expression vector pHis-TEV-E1 for wild-type BCKD (13Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Chinsky J.M. Wynn R.M. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 954-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The recombinant His6-tagged BCKD heterotetramer was efficiently expressed in E. coli strain CG-712 (ESts) by cotransformation of the pGroESL plasmid overproducing chaperonins GroEL and GroES as described previously (14Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12400-12403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant His6-tagged BCKD heterotetramers were isolated from cell lysates using a Ni2+-NTA-derivatized Sepharose CL-6B column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) as described previously (16Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). BCKD proteins were further purified on a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (2.6 × 60 cm) connected to an FPLC system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The column buffer consisted of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmdithioerythritol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. BCKD activity during purification was assayed spectrophotometrically (see below). Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus protein reagent from Pierce with absorbance read at 595 nm. Alternatively, during enzyme purification, protein concentrations were determined by the direct measurement of absorbance at 280 nm using a calculated molar extinction coefficient of 1.15 cm−1 mg−1 ml for the α2β2 heterotetramer. To determineK m for TDP, a radiochemical assay based on activity of the reconstituted BCKD complex was used (15Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The rate of decarboxylation of 0.2 mmα-keto[1-14C]isovalerate ([1-14C]KIV) by BCKD in the presence of an excess of E2 and E3 was measured at varying concentrations of TDP. Double reciprocal plots were used to determineK m and V max values for cofactor TDP. For the determination of kinetic parameters for substrate KIV, a spectrophotometric assay, also according to the reconstituted BCKD complex activity, was employed. The assay mixture contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm NAD+, 0.4 mm CoA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 400 μm TDP, 7 nmlipoylated recombinant bovine E2, and 0.4 μm recombinant human E3 (17Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 413-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of NAD+ absorbance at 340 nm at different substrate concentrations was used to derive thek obs value. The plots observed the pseudo-first order decay. The double-reciprocal plots of k obsvalues versus KIV concentrations were used to determineK m and k cat values for KIV. The purified recombinant human BCKD was essentially devoid of TDP. The residual bound TDP was removed by exhaustive dialysis in the presence of 0.2 mm EDTA. The wild-type or mutant apo-BCKD (500 μg each) was incubated for 30 min with 150 μm Mg-TDP at 4 °C. The holo-BCKD was re-extracted with Ni2+-NTA resin and eluted with 100 mmimidazole. The BCKD-bound TDP was measured after oxidation to its fluorescent derivative thiochrome diphosphate in the presence of ferricyanide. The thiochrome diphosphate derivative was measured in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences model LS50B luminescence spectrometer (excitation wavelength, 375 nm; emission wavelength, 430 nm) as described previously (18Diefenbach R.J. Duggleby R.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Emission spectra over a range of 300–400-nm wavelengths for bound TDP were obtained using the luminescence spectrometer at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm as described previously (19Hennig J. Kern G. Neef H. Bisswanger H. Hübner G. Bisswanger H. Schellenberger A Biochemistry and Physiology of Thiamin Diphosphate Enzymes. A. u. C. Intemann, Prien, Germany1966: 243-251Google Scholar). The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by Mg-TDP was studied by adding increments of Mg-TDP to the cuvette containing apo-BCKD. The range of final Mg-TDP concentrations studied was 5–400 μm. Cycles of Mg-TDP addition and fluorescence measurements were repeated until the fluorescence quenched by the TDP bound to BCKD reached a plateau. Circular dichroism measurements were carried out on an AVIV (Lakewood, NJ) model 62 DS spectrometer. In human BCKD, residues that form each Mg-TDP cofactor binding pocket are derived from two separate subunits. Fig.1 shows that residues from both the α and β′ subunits are involved in binding to TDP, and the Mg2+ ion is held in an octahedral coordination. This topology maintains TDP in a strained “V-shaped” conformation having torsion angles ΦT = 100°, and ΦP = −71° to facilitate the proton extraction from the C-2 carbon (5Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.L. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 211-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Most of these residues are conserved among TDP-dependent enzymes including Glu-193-α, Gly-194-α (not shown), and Asn-222-α in the TDP-binding motif GDGX 26–28NN (20Hawkins C.F. Borges A. Perham R.N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and the invariant catalytic residue Glu-76-β′. To establish the functional role of these active site residues, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out. His6-tagged wild-type and mutant BCKD carrying a single amino acid substitution were expressed in E. coli by cotransformation with chaperonins GroEL and GroES. The proteins were purified by Ni2+-NTA extraction followed by FPLC gel filtration on a HiLoad Superdex 200 column. The mutant BCKD used for this study uniformly formed heterotetramers, and no gross conformational changes were detected by circular dichroism spectroscopy (data not shown). The highly purified wild-type and mutant BCKD were used to determine their kinetic parameters and abilities to bind cofactor TDP. As shown in Fig. 1, Glu-76-β′ is directly bound to the N-1′ atom of the aminopyrimidine ring at a distance of 3.4 Å, whereas the main-chain carbonyl group of Ser-162-α coordinates to the N-4′ group on the opposite side of the ring, with the two entities being 3.0 Å apart. The electron withdrawal caused by the interaction between Glu-76-β′ and the N-1′ atom increases the basicity of the N-4′ amino group through tautomerization. This interaction is essential for efficient proton abstraction from the C-2 atom of the thiazolium ring of TDP, giving rise to the reactive ylide (21Kern D. Kern G. Neef H. Tittman K. Killenberg-Jabs M. Wikner C. Schneider G. Hübner G. Mattick J. Science. 1997; 275: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The nucleophilic attack of the α-ketoacid substrate at the reactive C-2 carbon of the ylide results in a tetrahedral adduct. Decarboxylation of this intermediate produces a 2-α-carbanion or enamine-TDP, which is stabilized by a neutral resonance. This mechanism for TDP-mediated decarboxylation is entirely conserved (22Jordan F. Nemeria N. Guo F. Baburina I. Gao Y. Kahyaoglu A. Li H. Wang J. Yi J. Guest J.R. Furey W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 287-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the case of human BCKD, the decarboxylated acyl moiety on the enamine-TDP is transferred to the E2 dithiolane ring to produce the tetrahedral adduct S-acyldihydrolipoamide. In the present study, substitution of Glu-76-β′ with Ala (E76A-β, Table I) renders BCKD completely inactive. The data establish Glu-76-β′ as an essential catalytic residue. On the other hand, the interaction between the carbonyl group of Ser-162-α and the N-4′ amino group is required to orient the latter for proton abstraction from the C-2 atom of the thiazolium ring. Since it involves a main-chain carbonyl group, a replacement with Ala is without effect on the catalytic efficiency for the TDP, although the same parameter for substrate KIV is significantly reduced.Table IKinetic parameters of BCKD mutants affecting residues involved in TDP-mediated decarboxylationEnzymeKIVTDPK mk catk cat/K m(×103)K mk catk cat/K m(×103)μms−1s−1μm−1μms−1s−1μm−1Wild type628.251400.668.1612,400E76A-β00S162A-α781.75220.456.414,200H146A-β00S292D-α00L164A-α2,8081.80.652732.38.3Y102A-β751.3171.92.21150 Open table in a new tab His-146-β′ aligns with His-131-β′ in BCKD from P. putida. The latter residue was shown to form an adduct with a substrate analog, α-chloroisocaproate, in the crystal structure of the Pseudomonas enzyme (6Ævarsson A. Seger K. Turley S. Sokatch J.R. Hol W.G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that binding of the substrate analog to His-131-β′ of the bacterial BCKD mimics a natural α-ketoacid substrate. The complete absence of enzyme activity in H146A-β′ (Table I) is consistent with the role of this residue in binding substrate KIV in human BCKD. The “isocaproate” moiety modeled into the His-146-β′ residue of human BCKD shows that the carboxylate oxygen is 4.3 Å away from the N-4′ amino group of TDP (Fig. 1). The data support the possible role of His-146-β′ in positioning a native ketoacid substrate (e.g. KIV) for the TDP-mediated decarboxylation. This point needs to be confirmed by co-crystallization of human BCKD with α-chloroisocaproate, which has not been successful to date. Recently, the structure of theDesulfovibrio africanus pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase in complex with pyruvate (23Chabriere E. Charon M.-H. Volbeda A. Pieulle L. Hatchikian E.C. Gontecilla-Camps J.-C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) demonstrates that a carboxylate oxygen from pyruvate interacts directly with the N-4′ amino group of TDP. Together, the data strongly imply that the polarization of the substrate carboxylate moiety by the N-4′ amino group of the cofactor is necessary for activation of the substrate. Ser-292-α and Ser-302-α are site 1 and site 2 for phosphorylation of human BCKD by the specific kinase. Phosphorylation at site 1 results in inactivation of BCKD, whereas phosphorylation at site 2 is silent. Introduction of a negatively charged Asp residue in the S292D-α mutant produces the same inactivation effect as phosphorylation at this residue (Table I). This result confirms an earlier study in which replacement of site 1 Ser with Glu in rat BCKD also results in an inactive enzyme (24Zhao Y. Hawes J. Popov K.M. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, Ser-292-α is positioned directly above the C-2 atoms of the thiazolium ring of TDP at an 8-Å distance. The introduction of a negatively charged phosphate group or amino acid residue is likely to interfere with the proton abstraction from the C-2 atom by the basic amino group at N-4′ position of the aminopyrimidine ring. Moreover, Ser-292-α is 9 Å away from His-146-β′ (Fig. 1). The presence of negative charges by phosphorylation or site-directed mutagenesis may also disrupt binding of the α-ketoacid substrate as suggested in earlier studies (24Zhao Y. Hawes J. Popov K.M. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18583-18587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,25Dean A.M. Koshland D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 1044-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The side chain of Tyr-102-β′ is packed against one side of the aminopyrimidine ring of the cofactor with the side chain of Leu-164-α approaching the other side of the ring, wedging in between the two rings of the cofactor (Fig. 1). The flanking of both sides of the aminopyrimidine ring by these two hydrophobic residues is important to orient the cofactor in the strained V conformation. Substitution of either residue with an Ala has adverse effects in the catalytic efficiency of the mutant enzymes (Table I). However, L164A-α is markedly more severely affected than Y102A-β′. The data suggest that Leu-164-α is more important in providing the hydrophobic environment for the aminopyrimidine and possibly the thiazolium ring of the cofactor. The amounts of TDP bound to His6-tagged wild-type and mutant BCKD were measured by incubating the enzymes with 150 μm of Mg-TDP. Following Ni2+-NTA extraction, the bound TDP was determined in the form of thiochrome pyrophosphate (18Diefenbach R.J. Duggleby R.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This method allowed for end point measurements of bound TDP in BCKD incubated at saturating concentrations of the cofactor. The results showed that each mole of wild-type BCKD binds ∼2 mol of TDP (Fig. 2 A). The data confirm the presence of two cofactor-binding sites in the BCKD heterotetramer. It is noteworthy that the active site residues involved in catalysis or substrate binding have little effect on TDP binding. This notion is supported by the slight decrease in TDP binding as observed with the E76A-β′, S162A-α, H146A-β′, and S292D-α mutants (Fig.2 A). In the S162A-α mutant, the near wild-typeK m for TDP agrees well with a TDP-binding stoichiometry that is also similar to wild-type. In contrast, the L164A-α mutant binds only a trace amount of TDP, which is consistent with an over 400-fold increase in K m for TDP relative to the wild-type. The data indicate that Leu-164-α that wedges in between the two aromatic rings of the cofactor is important for TDP binding. It is of interest that TDP binding in the Y102A-β′ mutant is not as severely affected as the L164A-α. The results confirm that Tyr-102-β′, which is across the aminopyrimidine ring planar from Leu-164-α, is less critical for the cofactor binding. As shown in Fig. 1, the Mg2+ ion is octahedrally coordinated between the cofactor phosphates, the carbonyl of Tyr-224-α (not shown) and the side chains of Asn-222-α and Glu-193-α. A substitution of Glu-193-α with Ala results in complete loss of BCKD activity (Table II). An E193K-α mutation recently identified in an MSUD patient also renders the enzyme inactive (data not shown). The N222S-α mutation, which was identified in an MSUD patient, results in marked increases inK m for KIV and TDP, whereas thek cat values are one half of the wild-type. These data, taken together, indicate that the carbonyl groups in the side chains of Glu-193-α and Asn-222-α are critical for Mg2+ion binding. The hydroxyl group of the Ser side chain in the N222S-α mutant is probably a poorer ligand than Asn for the Mg2+ion. The Oγ of a Ser residue would not be able to extend as far toward the Mg2+ ion as the Oδ1 of the Asn residue; this is likely to decrease affinity for the Mg2+ ion at this site. The less attenuated effect in affinity for KIV and TDP in the Y224A-α mutant, compared with the above two mutants is consistent with the fact that the main-chain carbonyl group of Tyr-224-α coordinates to the metal ion. The critical roles of Glu-193-α and Asn-222-α side chains in the metal ion binding is supported by the markedly diminished levels of bound TDP in the E193A-α, N222A-α, and Y224A-α mutants (Fig.2 B). The Y224A-α mutant also shows a markedly decreased ability to bind TDP despite an only moderate increase inK m for the cofactor.Table IIKinetic constants of BCKD mutants affecting residues involved in Mg2+ ion bindingEnzymeKIVTDPK mk catk cat/K m(×103)K mk catk cat/K m(×103)μms−1s−1μm−1μms−1s−1μm−1Wild type628.251400.668.1612,400E193A-α00N222S-α2-aNaturally occurring mutation in MSUD patients.3,2264.11.257714.56.16Y224A-α682.940254.04002-a Naturally occurring mutation in MSUD patients. Open table in a new tab Gln-112-α and Tyr-113-α are hydrogen-bonded to the proximal and the terminal phosphate oxygens of TDP, respectively (5Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.L. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 211-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Substitution of Gln-112-α with an Ala residue has marginal effects in catalytic efficiency of BCKD as well as K m values for KIV and TDP (Table III). The data suggest that either the side chain of the Gln-112-α is not an essential ligand to the Mg2+ ion or that a neighboring residue(s) can fill in this function. The introduction of an Ala residue into the Tyr-113-α position results in more than 50- and 100-fold increases in K m for KIV and TDP, indicating that Tyr-113-α is an important ligand to the terminal phosphate oxygen. Remarkably, a replacement of Arg-114-α, which also coordinates to the same terminal phosphate oxygen (Fig. 1), with an Ala residue results in a completely inactive BCKD. The R114W-α mutation, which occurs in MSUD patients, also renders the enzyme completely inactive. As for Arg-220-α, which coordinates to another distal phosphate oxygen, when changed to Ala, Lys or Trp (an MSUD mutation) also results in complete loss in enzyme activity. The combined results strongly suggest that the ionic interactions between positively charged Arg-114-α or Arg-220-α and the negatively charged phosphate oxygens are critical in maintaining the conformational integrity of the diphosphate group of TDP (Fig. 1). In the case of R220K-α, the positively charged Lys residue is pointing away from the distal phosphate oxygen in the BCKD structure. Therefore, the ionic interactions between the Lys side chain and the phosphate oxygen cannot occur.Table IIIKinetic constants of BCKD mutants affecting residues coordinating to diphosphate oxygens of TDPEnzymeKIVTDPK mk catk cat/K m(×103)K mk catk cat/K m(×103)μms−1s−1μm−1μms−1s−1μm−1Wild type628.251400.668.1612,400Q112A-α19.72.031001.33.02300Y113A-α3344.51470.57.5110R114A-α00R114W-α3-aNaturally occurring mutation in MSUD patients.00R220A-α00R220K-α00R220W-α3-aNaturally occurring mutation in MSUD patients.00H291A-α2060.582.8240.73313-a Naturally occurring mutation in MSUD patients. Open table in a new tab His-291-α coordinates to another distal phosphate oxygen in the TDP-binding pocket (Fig. 1). Substitution of this residue with Ala results in a trace amount of BCKD activity (Table III). A previous report showed that the same mutation in the rat BCKD is associated with complete absence of activity (26Hawes J.W. Schnepf R.J. Jenkins A.E. Shimomura Y. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31071-31076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); however, a spectrophotometric assay was used in the latter study, which is less sensitive than the radiochemical assay employed here. The combined results are thus consistent with His-291-α as an essential ligand to the diphosphate group of TDP. It is noteworthy that the K m for TDP with the His-291-α mutant is increased by 40-fold over the wild-type (Table III). This is consistent with about 15% of TDP bound to this mutant compared with the wild-type (Fig. 2 C). Modifications of the three other residues Arg-114-α, Arg-220-α, and Gln-112-α that coordinate to the diphosphate oxygens invariably yield marginal binding of TDP (Fig. 2 C). The data strongly suggest that the amino acid ligands to the diphosphate moiety of TDP are as important as the ligands to the aminopyrimidine ring in maintaining the V conformation of the cofactor. It should be mentioned that in addition to being a ligand for the TDP diphosphate group, His-291-α has been implicated to function as a catalytic residue (6Ævarsson A. Seger K. Turley S. Sokatch J.R. Hol W.G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As described above, BCKD functions as both a decarboxylase and a dehydrogenase during the oxidative decarboxylation of α-ketoacids. His-291-α is proposed to serve as a proton donor during the reduction of the disulfide bond of the E2-attached lipoamide, which occurs during acyltransfer from the enamine-TDP to E2. In the H291A-α mutant, the reduction of lipoamide on E2 by the dehydrogenase activity of BCKD may be disrupted. The additional role of His-291-α as a proton donor to the E2-attached lipoamide will require further studies. The crystal structure of human BCKD disclosed that the α and the β subunits each has a distinct K+ ion binding fold that has not been described previously in any TDP-dependent enzyme (5Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.L. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 211-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows that the K+ ion on the α subunit stabilizes a loop containing residues Ser-161-α, Thr-166-α, and Gln-167-α, which are directly involved in ligating to the metal ion through their side chains. The structural integrity of this loop structure is essential for ordering Ser-162-α and Leu-164-α for interactions of these residues with the cofactor TDP as described above. An MSUD mutation, T166M-α, is likely to abolish the coordination of the Thr side chain to the K+ ion, resulting in a disorder of this loop with a concomitant disruption of TDP binding. This accounts for the loss of both enzyme activity (TableIV) and the inability of the mutant enzyme to bind TDP (Fig. 2 D). It is of interest that the replacement of Thr-166-α with an Ala has little effect on the catalytic efficiency of BCKD. It is possible that the side chain of Ala, which is shorter than that of Met, does not aberrantly protrude into the K+ ion binding pocket. As a result, the octahedral coordination is not severely impaired by this substitution. This is reflected by near wild-type catalytic efficiency of the T166A-α mutant when assayed at saturating TDP concentrations (Table IV). However, the binding affinity of the mutant enzyme for the cofactor is still reduced as indicated by an elevated K m for TDP (Table IV) and by a significant decrease in the amount of the bound cofactor compared with the wild-type (Fig. 2).Table IVKinetic parameters of BCKD mutants affecting residues involved in K+ ion bindingEnzymeKIVTDPK mk catk cat/K m(×103)K mk catk cat/K m(×103)μms−1s−1μm−1μms−1s−1 μm−1Wild type628.251400.668.1612,400T166A-α9.851.11102.550.93370T166M-α4-aNaturally occurring mutation in MSUD patients.004-a Naturally occurring mutation in MSUD patients. Open table in a new tab One of the characteristics associated with TDP-dependent enzymes involves quenching of tryptophan fluorescence upon binding of the cofactor (19Hennig J. Kern G. Neef H. Bisswanger H. Hübner G. Bisswanger H. Schellenberger A Biochemistry and Physiology of Thiamin Diphosphate Enzymes. A. u. C. Intemann, Prien, Germany1966: 243-251Google Scholar). This property has been used as a means to determine the level of the cofactor binding by TDP-dependent enzymes (22Jordan F. Nemeria N. Guo F. Baburina I. Gao Y. Kahyaoglu A. Li H. Wang J. Yi J. Guest J.R. Furey W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 287-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Candy J.M. Duggleby R.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To identify the Trp residue quenched by BCKD-bound TDP, we replaced Trp-136-β, which is the Trp residue closest to the aminopyrimidine ring of the cofactor at 15–18 Å, with a Phe. As a control, a distal Trp-309-α was also converted to a Phe. The W136F-β mutant BCKD showed K m values for KIV and TDP, which are similar to those for the wild-type (data not shown). Therefore, Trp-136-β appears to be nonessential for efficient binding of both the substrate and the cofactor. The apoenzymes of the wild type, W136F-β, and W309F-α were excited at 280 nm. The fluorescence emission spectra of the wild-type and W309F-α apo-BCKD were similar (Fig. 4). The maximal fluorescence emissions at 340 nm for both proteins are progressively quenched when titrated with increasing concentrations of Mg-TDP. In contrast, the maximal emission at 340 nm of the W136F-β mutant enzyme is not quenched over the same concentration range of Mg-TDP. The result established that Trp-136-β is the residue that is quenched upon TDP binding. In pyruvate decarboxylase from Z. mobilis, the Trp-487 was shown to also be quenched by the bound TDP (28Diefenbach R.J. Candy J.M. Mattick J.S. Duggleby R.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of this bacterial pyruvate decarboxylase shows that Trp-487 is 18 Å away from the aminopyrimidine of a chemically modified cofactor, 2-(1-hydroxyethyl)-TDP (10Dobritzsch D. Konig S. Schneider G. Lu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20196-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, the Trp residues in human BCKD and the bacterial pyruvate decarboxylase, which are quenched upon TDP binding, are in similar conformations relative to the cofactor. In the related pyruvate dehydrogenase, Trp-135-β was reported to be the residue that is quenched in response to TDP binding using chemical modification and magnetic circular dichroism methods (29Ali M.S. Shenoy B.C. Eswaran D. Andersson L.A. Roche T.E. Patel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4570-4574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the structure of the pyruvate dehydrogenase has not yet been determined, Trp-135-β in this enzyme aligns with the Trp-136-β in human BCKD. The data show the conservation of the quenchable Trp residue in TDP-dependent enzymes. The present study defines the functional roles of active site residues in human BCKD, which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain α-ketoacids. The results depict a high degree of conservation in the structure and function of the TDP binding fold in TDP-dependent enzymes. These enzymes include those that catalyze the TDP-mediated oxidative decarboxylation, such as human BCKD (5Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.L. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 211-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the TDP-mediated nonoxidative decarboxylation, such as yeast pyruvate decarboxylase (8Dyda F. Furey W. Swaminathan S. Sax M. Farrenkopf B. Jordan F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6165-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and benzoylformate decarboxylate (12Hasson M.S. Muscate A. McLeish M.J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9918-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), as well as those that promote the two-carbon transfer, for example, yeast transketolase (7Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Ermler U. Sundstrom M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 30Nikkola M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 387-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Human BCKD is distinct among TDP-dependent enzymes in that the enzyme is both a decarboxylase and dehydrogenase. The enamine-TDP intermediate becomes a substrate for the acyltransfer reaction during the BCKD-mediated reduction of lipoamide covalently attached to the E2 core of the BCKD complex. The mechanism for the BCKD-catalyzed acyltransfer reaction remains to be elucidated at the structure level."

It is characterized by its Q00 (or α-) optical absorption band at 557 nm in the reduced form (Keightley, J. A., Sanders, D., Todaro, T. R., Pastuszyn, A., and Fee, J. A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 12006–12016). We report results of a broad ranging, biochemical and spectral characterization of this protein that reveals the presence of a free vinyl group on the porphyrin and a disulfide bond between the protomers and supports His-Met ligation in both valence states of the iron. A 3-Å resolution x-ray structure shows that, in comparison with the native protein, the heme moiety is rotated 180° about its α,γ-axis; cysteine 14 has formed a thioether bond with the 2-vinyl of pyrrole ring I instead of the 4-vinyl of pyrrole ring II, as occurs in the native protein; and a cysteine 11 from each protomer has formed an intermolecular disulfide bond. Numerous, minor perturbations exist within the structure of rC557 in comparison with that of native protein, which result from heme inversion and protein-protein interactions across the dimer interface. The unusual spectral properties of rC557 are rationalized in terms of this structure."

Perifusion experiments revealed that the first phase of insulin secretion was severely suppressed and that the second phase of secretion was completely abrogated. Removal of HAC from the perifusate immediately restored insulin secretion with a transient overshooting above the normal level. However, HAC failed to affect glucose-induced changes in d-[6-14C]glucose oxidation, levels of reduced forms of NAD and NADP, mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP content, cytosolic calcium concentration, or calcium influx into mitochondria.

The results of a co-immunoprecipitation study of lysates from insulin-secreting βHC9 cells using anti-syntaxin and anti-vesicle-associated membrane protein antibodies for immunoprecipitation or Western blotting suggested that HAC inhibited disruption of the SNARE complex, which is normally observed upon glucose challenge. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of HAC on glucose-induced insulin secretion is exerted at a site(s) distal to the elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+], possibly in the exocytotic machinery per se; and thus, HAC may serve as a useful tool for dissecting the molecular mechanism of insulin exocytotic processes.

The following cascade has been generally accepted as the glucose-induced insulin secretory pathway. When glucose is metabolized in the cytosol and mitochondria, ATP is generated to promote closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, and this depolarizes the plasma membrane potential. The depolarization of the plasma membrane leads to activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, with subsequent Ca2+ entry into the cytosol. The rise in [Ca2+]c is thought to finally trigger exocytosis of insulin from secretory vesicles (1Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. Smith P.A. Ammala C. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Cell.

Moreover, recent studies showed that the intramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]m) increases in accordance with the rise in [Ca2+]cupon glucose stimulation via a calcium transporter on the inner mitochondrial membrane (calcium uniporter) (15Tashmukhamedov B.A. Gagelgans A.I.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7071-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and that the increase in [Ca2+]m is closely associated with glucose-induced insulin secretion (17Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3833-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of [Ca2+]m in glucose-induced insulin secretion from isolated islets, we tested the effects of ruthenium red and hexamminecobalt(III) (HAC), both of which have been reported to be inhibitors of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (15Tashmukhamedov B.A. Gagelgans A.I. Mamatkulov K. Makhmudova E.M. FEBS Lett. 1972; 28: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B.

Ruthenium red was also reported to inhibit insulin secretion from permeabilized β cells through inhibition of the calcium uniporter (18Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3833-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We also observed that ruthenium red at 100 μm severely suppressed glucose-induced insulin secretion in mouse islets. However, under these conditions, Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane was almost completely inhibited. These results indicated that ruthenium red was not a suitable agent to study the relationship of [Ca2+]m to glucose-induced insulin secretion in intact cells, different from the case of permeabilized cells. In contrast, HAC at 2 mm suppressed glucose-induced insulin secretion to the same extent as 100 μm ruthenium red, without affecting the increase in [Ca2+]c in response to glucose. However, different from our initial expectations, HAC failed to affect glucose-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]m under these conditions. In this study, we tried to determine which step of the glucose-induced insulin secretory pathway was inhibited by HAC. HAC failed to suppress oxidation of glucose, glucose-stimulated generation of ATP, or Ca2+current through the plasma membrane, indicating that the inhibitory effect of HAC on insulin secretion was exerted distal to [Ca2+]c elevation. Our results suggested that the dissociation of the SNARE complex formed in the sequence of exocytotic events was prevented in the presence of HAC. Thus, HAC may serve as a useful probe to monitor steps distal to elevation of [Ca2+]c in the glucose-stimulated insulin secretory pathway. HAC, chlortetracycline, rhodamine 123, and the ATP bioluminescent assay kit were purchased from Sigma. Fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester was from Molecular Probes, Inc.

For monitoring of [Ca2+]c, islets were loaded with 15 μm fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester at 37 °C for 1 h. The fluorescence was excited in a dual-wavelength ratiometric mode at 340 and 380 nm. The emission wavelength was filtered at 500 nm. [Ca2+]c was expressed as the 340/380 nm emission ratio (5Mertz R.J. Worley J.F. Spencer B. Johnson J.H. Dukes I.D. J. Biol.

The immune complexes precipitated with agarose beads were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). All samples were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels; transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes; and probed with anti-VAMP or anti-syntaxin antibody, followed by detection with the ECL kit. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test for unpaired comparisons. Values are shown as means ± S.E. The effect of HAC on glucose-induced insulin secretion from isolated islets was measured in static incubations for 60 min (Fig.1 A). In the presence of 2.8 mm glucose, islets released 0.5 ± 0.1 ng of insulin/h/islet (n = 4), and HAC at 2 mmfailed to exert significant inhibition of insulin secretion under these conditions (0.4 ± 0.1 ng/h/islet, n = 4). In the presence of 22.2 mm glucose, insulin secretion from isolated islets increased to 3.2 ± 0.1 ng/h/islet (n = 4), and HAC inhibited this secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the inhibition by 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 mm HAC amounted to 0, 50, 71, and 90% of the glucose-stimulated increase in insulin secretion, respectively. Perifusion experiments revealed the effect of HAC on the kinetics of glucose-induced insulin secretion from isolated islets (Fig.1 B). An increase in glucose concentration from 2.8 to 16.7 mm induced a biphasic insulin secretion in control islets (Fig. 1 B, ○). In the presence of 2 mm HAC, the first phase of insulin secretion (0–10 min) over the basal values was inhibited by 80%, and the second phase was completely abrogated (Fig.1 B, ●). Removal of HAC from the perifusate at 20 min caused a prompt and full restoration of insulin secretion with a transient overshooting above the second phase level of the control (Fig. 1 B, ▴). To examine the effect of HAC on mitochondrial metabolism eventually leading to ATP generation, we measured glucose-induced changes in d-[6-14C]glucose oxidation, the level of NAD(P)H, mitochondrial inner membrane potential, and ATP content in islets. Oxidation ofd-[6-14C]glucose to14CO2, which well reflects the tricarboxylic acid cycle activity at the level of isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (24Schuit F. De Vos A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18572-18579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), was increased by 13-fold when extracellular glucose was raised from 2.8 to 22.2 mm in control islets (0.6 ± 0.1 and 8.5 ± 1.5 pmol/h/islet, respectively; n = 4) (TableI). HAC at 2 mm did not affect d-[6-14C]glucose oxidation in the presence of 2.8 mm glucose (0.6 ± 0.2 pmol/h/islet,n = 4). In the presence of 22.2 mm glucose, HAC also failed to significantly changed-[6-14C]glucose oxidation (11.5 ± 1.8 pmol/h/islet, n = 4) compared with control islets incubated at the same glucose concentration.Table IEffects of HAC on d-[6-14C]glucose oxidation and ATP generation in isletsd-[6-14C]Glucose oxidationATP content2.8 mmglucose22.2 mm glucose2.8 mmglucose22.2 mm glucosepmol/h/isletpmol/isletControl0.6 ± 0.18.5 ± 1.58.5 ± 0.412.0 ± 0.8HAC0.6 ± 0.211.5 ± 1.89.1 ± 0.514.5 ± 1.0Glucose oxidation was measured by generation of 14CO2from d-[6-14C]glucose.

ATP contents in these lysates were measured by a luminometric method. The results are expressed as means ± S.E. (n = 4). We then monitored the autofluorescence of NAD(P)H (Fig.2 A), which mainly reflects that of the mitochondrial NADH pool (29Duchen M.R. Smith P.A. Ashcroft F.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The autofluorescence of NAD(P)H was increased above basal levels by 22.2 mm glucose in control islets (396 ± 49 arbitrary units, n = 4). In the presence of 2 mm HAC, although the increase to a plateau in autofluorescence was delayed by 3 min, the magnitude of the increase at 10 min after glucose stimulation (393 ± 71 arbitrary units, n = 4) was not significantly different from that observed in control islets. Furthermore, we measured glucose-stimulated hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, which is formed by the respiratory chain function and in turn drives ATP synthesis, with the fluorescence of rhodamine 123 (Fig. 2 B). In control islets, the fluorescence of rhodamine 123 was decreased in response to glucose stimulation (578 ± 38 arbitrary units, n = 4), which reflects the shift in the mitochondrial membrane potential to hyperpolarization (18Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3833-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). HAC at 2 mm failed to cause any significant change in glucose-induced hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane (565 ± 10 units, n = 4). Next, we measured the ATP content of islets to directly monitor the efficiency of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. After a 1-h static incubation with 22.2 mm glucose at 37 °C, the ATP content was increased by 40% (12.0 ± 0.8 pmol/islet,n = 4) compared with that with 2.8 mmglucose in control islets (8.5 ± 0.4 pmol/islet,n = 4) (Table I). When 2 mm HAC was added, the ATP content of islets incubated with 2.8 mm glucose remained unchanged (9.1 ± 0.5 pmol/islet, n = 4), whereas a slight, but not significant increase in ATP content over the control islets was noted in the presence of 22.2 mm glucose (14.5 ± 1.0 pmol/islet, n = 4). These results indicated that HAC has no inhibitory effects on ATP generation through mitochondrial glucose metabolism. To investigate the effect of HAC on the increase in [Ca2+]c in response to glucose stimulation, we monitored the fluorescence of fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester excited at 340 and 380 nm in perifused islets (Fig. 2 C). When the glucose concentration was increased from 2.8 to 22.2 mm, [Ca2+]c, which was expressed as the 340/380 nm fluorescence ratio, was increased in control islets by 0.143 ± 0.023 (n = 5). In the presence of 2 mm HAC, [Ca2+]c also rose in response to glucose stimulation (0.123 ± 0.018, n = 6;p = 0.51 compared with control islets), although the time taken to increase to a plateau was delayed by 1 min compared with the controls. Moreover, the duration (2.6 ± 0.1 min,n = 6) and magnitude (0.024 ± 0.002,n = 6) of “phase 0” [Ca2+]cchange below a base-line level in islets treated with HAC were not different from those of controls (duration, 2.8 ± 0.1 min,n = 5; magnitude, 0.022 ± 0.003,n = 5). We also directly measured the plasma membrane potential and Ca2+ currents of single β cells with patch clamp techniques (30Bokvist K. Eliasson L. Ammala C. Renstrom E. Rorsman P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 31Kanno T. Suga S. Nakano K. Kamimura N. Wakui M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1741-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and found that HAC at 2 mm did not interfere with 22.2 mm glucose-responsive changes in this potential or currents (data not shown). It was previously reported that HAC inhibits the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, which mediates Ca2+ entry into the mitochondrial matrix in response to changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (15Tashmukhamedov B.A. Gagelgans A.I. Mamatkulov K. Makhmudova E.M. FEBS Lett. 1972; 28: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Litsky M.L. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7071-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It was also reported that [Ca2+]m, which rises in accordance with [Ca2+]c upon glucose stimulation, is associated with glucose-induced insulin secretion (17Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We thus measured [Ca2+]m with chlortetracycline. Chlortetracycline is a fluorescent Ca2+probe that allows continuous monitoring of an intramitochondrial Ca2+ pool bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane, possessing a substantial fluorescence intensity suitable for quantitative measurement (Fig. 2 D) (25Luthra R. Olson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 440: 744-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In control islets, chlortetracycline fluorescence was increased above the basal level by 233 ± 17 arbitrary units (n = 8) in response to 22.2 mm glucose. In the presence of 2 mm HAC, an increase in chlortetracycline fluorescence in response to glucose (234 ± 17 arbitrary units, n = 7) was also observed and was not significantly different in magnitude from that of control islets. However, the onset of the increase was delayed by 1 min compared with controls. A high concentration of extracellular KCl decreases K+ conductance and leads to depolarization of the plasma membrane, with subsequent activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (32Sehlin J. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240: C35-C38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect of KCl causes elevation of [Ca2+]c and results in insulin secretion by β cells. We examined whether HAC also inhibits this depolarization-induced insulin secretion, which does not require mitochondrial glucose metabolism or ATP synthesis. HAC did not affect insulin secretion at the basal concentration of KCl (4.8 mm). When 50 mm KCl was added to the medium, insulin secretion was increased to 3.6 ± 0.6 ng/h/islet (n = 4). However, 2 mm HAC decreased KCl-stimulated insulin secretion to 1.3 ± 0.1 ng/h/islet (n = 4) (Fig.3 A). Mastoparan, a tetradecapeptide purified from wasp venom, activates heterotrimeric G-proteins and stimulates insulin secretion from β cells even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (33Komatsu M. McDermott A.M. Gillison S.L. Sharp G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23297-23306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Konrad R.J. Young R.A. Record R.D. Smith R.M. Butkerait P. Manning D.

We examined the effect of HAC on mastoparan-stimulated insulin secretion in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig.3 B). Mastoparan at 10 μm increased insulin secretion to 3.5 ± 0.4 ng/h/islet (n = 4) in the absence of external Ca2+, whereas 22.2 mmglucose elicited no significant increase (0.6 ± 0.1 ng/h/islet,n = 4) under these Ca2+-free conditions. HAC at 2 mm inhibited mastoparan-stimulated insulin secretion by 80%.
