https://openalex.org/W3000922508,"Long-lasting, latently infected resting CD4+ T cells are the greatest obstacle to obtaining a cure for HIV infection, as these cells can persist despite decades of treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Estimates indicate that more than 70 years of continuous, fully suppressive ART are needed to eliminate the HIV reservoir1. Alternatively, induction of HIV from its latent state could accelerate the decrease in the reservoir, thus reducing the time to eradication. Previous attempts to reactivate latent HIV in preclinical animal models and in clinical trials have measured HIV induction in the peripheral blood with minimal focus on tissue reservoirs and have had limited effect2–9. Here we show that activation of the non-canonical NF-κB signalling pathway by AZD5582 results in the induction of HIV and SIV RNA expression in the blood and tissues of ART-suppressed bone-marrow–liver–thymus (BLT) humanized mice and rhesus macaques infected with HIV and SIV, respectively. Analysis of resting CD4+ T cells from tissues after AZD5582 treatment revealed increased SIV RNA expression in the lymph nodes of macaques and robust induction of HIV in almost all tissues analysed in humanized mice, including the lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, liver and lung. This promising approach to latency reversal—in combination with appropriate tools for systemic clearance of persistent HIV infection—greatly increases opportunities for HIV eradication. Activation of the non-canonical NF-κB signalling pathway by AZD5582 results in the induction of HIV and SIV RNA expression in the blood and tissues of antiretroviral-therapy-treated humanized mice and rhesus macaques."
https://openalex.org/W3002419408,"Abstract Our current knowledge about nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) is largely derived from viral isolates that are co-cultivated with protists and algae. Here we reconstructed 2,074 NCLDV genomes from sampling sites across the globe by building on the rapidly increasing amount of publicly available metagenome data. This led to an 11-fold increase in phylogenetic diversity and a parallel 10-fold expansion in functional diversity. Analysis of 58,023 major capsid proteins from large and giant viruses using metagenomic data revealed the global distribution patterns and cosmopolitan nature of these viruses. The discovered viral genomes encoded a wide range of proteins with putative roles in photosynthesis and diverse substrate transport processes, indicating that host reprogramming is probably a common strategy in the NCLDVs. Furthermore, inferences of horizontal gene transfer connected viral lineages to diverse eukaryotic hosts. We anticipate that the global diversity of NCLDVs that we describe here will establish giant viruses—which are associated with most major eukaryotic lineages—as important players in ecosystems across Earth’s biomes."
https://openalex.org/W3003002159,"Increased cardiac contractility during the fight-or-flight response is caused by β-adrenergic augmentation of CaV1.2 voltage-gated calcium channels1–4. However, this augmentation persists in transgenic murine hearts expressing mutant CaV1.2 α1C and β subunits that can no longer be phosphorylated by protein kinase A—an essential downstream mediator of β-adrenergic signalling—suggesting that non-channel factors are also required. Here we identify the mechanism by which β-adrenergic agonists stimulate voltage-gated calcium channels. We express α1C or β2B subunits conjugated to ascorbate peroxidase5 in mouse hearts, and use multiplexed quantitative proteomics6,7 to track hundreds of proteins in the proximity of CaV1.2. We observe that the calcium-channel inhibitor Rad8,9, a monomeric G protein, is enriched in the CaV1.2 microenvironment but is depleted during β-adrenergic stimulation. Phosphorylation by protein kinase A of specific serine residues on Rad decreases its affinity for β subunits and relieves constitutive inhibition of CaV1.2, observed as an increase in channel open probability. Expression of Rad or its homologue Rem in HEK293T cells also imparts stimulation of CaV1.3 and CaV2.2 by protein kinase A, revealing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that confers adrenergic modulation upon voltage-gated calcium channels. An in vivo approach to identify proteins whose enrichment near cardiac CaV1.2 channels changes upon β-adrenergic stimulation finds the G protein Rad, which is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, thereby relieving channel inhibition by Rad and causing an increased Ca2+ current."
https://openalex.org/W3000976129,"Empirical and anecdotal evidence has associated stress with accelerated hair greying (formation of unpigmented hairs)1,2, but so far there has been little scientific validation of this link. Here we report that, in mice, acute stress leads to hair greying through the fast depletion of melanocyte stem cells. Using a combination of adrenalectomy, denervation, chemogenetics3,4, cell ablation and knockout of the adrenergic receptor specifically in melanocyte stem cells, we find that the stress-induced loss of melanocyte stem cells is independent of immune attack or adrenal stress hormones. Instead, hair greying results from activation of the sympathetic nerves that innervate the melanocyte stem-cell niche. Under conditions of stress, the activation of these sympathetic nerves leads to burst release of the neurotransmitter noradrenaline (also known as norepinephrine). This causes quiescent melanocyte stem cells to proliferate rapidly, and is followed by their differentiation, migration and permanent depletion from the niche. Transient suppression of the proliferation of melanocyte stem cells prevents stress-induced hair greying. Our study demonstrates that neuronal activity that is induced by acute stress can drive a rapid and permanent loss of somatic stem cells, and illustrates an example in which the maintenance of somatic stem cells is directly influenced by the overall physiological state of the organism."

https://openalex.org/W3001801234,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) persists indefinitely in individuals with HIV who receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) owing to a reservoir of latently infected cells that contain replication-competent virus1–4. Here, to better understand the mechanisms responsible for latency persistence and reversal, we used the interleukin-15 superagonist N-803 in conjunction with the depletion of CD8+ lymphocytes in ART-treated macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Although N-803 alone did not reactivate virus production, its administration after the depletion of CD8+ lymphocytes in conjunction with ART treatment induced robust and persistent reactivation of the virus in vivo. We found viraemia of more than 60 copies per ml in all macaques (n = 14; 100%) and in 41 out of a total of 56 samples (73.2%) that were collected each week after N-803 administration. Notably, concordant results were obtained in ART-treated HIV-infected humanized mice. In addition, we observed that co-culture with CD8+ T cells blocked the in vitro latency-reversing effect of N-803 on primary human CD4+ T cells that were latently infected with HIV. These results advance our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for latency reversal and lentivirus reactivation during ART-suppressed infection. The interleukin-15 superagonist N-803, combined with the depletion of CD8+ lymphocytes, induced a robust and persistent reactivation of the virus in vivo in both antiretroviral-therapy-treated SIV-infected macaques and HIV-infected humanized mice."

https://openalex.org/W3001272727,"Gene transcription by RNA polymerase II is regulated by activator proteins that recruit the coactivator complexes SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase)1,2 and transcription factor IID (TFIID)2-4. SAGA is required for all regulated transcription5 and is conserved among eukaryotes6. SAGA contains four modules7-9: the activator-binding Tra1 module, the core module, the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) module and the histone deubiquitination (DUB) module. Previous studies provided partial structures10-14, but the structure of the central core module is unknown. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of SAGA from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and resolve the core module at 3.3 Å resolution. The core module consists of subunits Taf5, Sgf73 and Spt20, and a histone octamer-like fold. The octamer-like fold comprises the heterodimers Taf6-Taf9, Taf10-Spt7 and Taf12-Ada1, and two histone-fold domains in Spt3. Spt3 and the adjacent subunit Spt8 interact with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP)2,7,15-17. The octamer-like fold and its TBP-interacting region are similar in TFIID, whereas Taf5 and the Taf6 HEAT domain adopt distinct conformations. Taf12 and Spt20 form flexible connections to the Tra1 module, whereas Sgf73 tethers the DUB module. Binding of a nucleosome to SAGA displaces the HAT and DUB modules from the core-module surface, allowing the DUB module to bind one face of an ubiquitinated nucleosome."
https://openalex.org/W3001044055,"Many proteins exist naturally as symmetrical homooligomers or homopolymers1. The emergent structural and functional properties of such protein assemblies have inspired extensive efforts in biomolecular design2-5. As synthesized by ribosomes, proteins are inherently asymmetric. Thus, they must acquire multiple surface patches that selectively associate to generate the different symmetry elements needed to form higher-order architectures1,6-a daunting task for protein design. Here we address this problem using an inorganic chemical approach, whereby multiple modes of protein-protein interactions and symmetry are simultaneously achieved by selective, 'one-pot' coordination of soft and hard metal ions. We show that a monomeric protein (protomer) appropriately modified with biologically inspired hydroxamate groups and zinc-binding motifs assembles through concurrent Fe3+ and Zn2+ coordination into discrete dodecameric and hexameric cages. Our cages closely resemble natural polyhedral protein architectures7,8 and are, to our knowledge, unique among designed systems9-13 in that they possess tightly packed shells devoid of large apertures. At the same time, they can assemble and disassemble in response to diverse stimuli, owing to their heterobimetallic construction on minimal interprotein-bonding footprints. With stoichiometries ranging from [2 Fe:9 Zn:6 protomers] to [8 Fe:21 Zn:12 protomers], these protein cages represent some of the compositionally most complex protein assemblies-or inorganic coordination complexes-obtained by design."
https://openalex.org/W3002889477,"SAGA (Spt–Ada–Gcn5–acetyltransferase) is a 19-subunit complex that stimulates transcription via two chromatin-modifying enzymatic modules and by delivering the TATA box binding protein (TBP) to nucleate the pre-initiation complex on DNA, a pivotal event in the expression of protein-encoding genes1. Here we present the structure of yeast SAGA with bound TBP. The core of the complex is resolved at 3.5 Å resolution (0.143 Fourier shell correlation). The structure reveals the intricate network of interactions that coordinate the different functional domains of SAGA and resolves an octamer of histone-fold domains at the core of SAGA. This deformed octamer deviates considerably from the symmetrical analogue in the nucleosome and is precisely tuned to establish a peripheral site for TBP, where steric hindrance represses binding of spurious DNA. Complementary biochemical analysis points to a mechanism for TBP delivery and release from SAGA that requires transcription factor IIA and whose efficiency correlates with the affinity of DNA to TBP. We provide the foundations for understanding the specific delivery of TBP to gene promoters and the multiple roles of SAGA in regulating gene expression. Structural studies on the yeast transcription coactivator complex SAGA (Spt–Ada–Gcn5–acetyltransferase) provide insights into the mechanism of initiation of regulated transcription by this multiprotein complex, which is conserved among eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2995320028,"On infection of their host, temperate viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophages; hereafter referred to as phages) enter either a lytic or a lysogenic cycle. The former results in lysis of bacterial cells and phage release (resulting in horizontal transmission), whereas lysogeny is characterized by the integration of the phage into the host genome, and dormancy (resulting in vertical transmission)1. Previous co-culture experiments using bacteria and mutants of temperate phages that are locked in the lytic cycle have shown that CRISPR-Cas systems can efficiently eliminate the invading phages2,3. Here we show that, when challenged with wild-type temperate phages (which can become lysogenic), type I CRISPR-Cas immune systems cannot eliminate the phages from the bacterial population. Furthermore, our data suggest that, in this context, CRISPR-Cas immune systems are maladaptive to the host, owing to the severe immunopathological effects that are brought about by imperfect matching of spacers to the integrated phage sequences (prophages). These fitness costs drive the loss of CRISPR-Cas from bacterial populations, unless the phage carries anti-CRISPR (acr) genes that suppress the immune system of the host. Using bioinformatics, we show that this imperfect targeting is likely to occur frequently in nature. These findings help to explain the patchy distribution of CRISPR-Cas immune systems within and between bacterial species, and highlight the strong selective benefits of phage-encoded acr genes for both the phage and the host under these circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W3000951758,"Transcription challenges the integrity of replicating chromosomes by generating topological stress and conflicts with forks1,2. The DNA topoisomerases Top1 and Top2 and the HMGB family protein Hmo1 assist DNA replication and transcription3-6. Here we describe the topological architecture of genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. We found under-wound DNA at gene boundaries and over-wound DNA within coding regions. This arrangement does not depend on Pol II or S phase. Top2 and Hmo1 preserve negative supercoil at gene boundaries, while Top1 acts at coding regions. Transcription generates RNA-DNA hybrids within coding regions, independently of fork orientation. During S phase, Hmo1 protects under-wound DNA from Top2, while Top2 confines Pol II and Top1 at coding units, counteracting transcription leakage and aberrant hybrids at gene boundaries. Negative supercoil at gene boundaries prevents supercoil diffusion and nucleosome repositioning at coding regions. DNA looping occurs at Top2 clusters. We propose that Hmo1 locks gene boundaries in a cruciform conformation and, with Top2, modulates the architecture of genes that retain the memory of the topological arrangements even when transcription is repressed."
https://openalex.org/W3001329451,"We use a globally unique dataset that scores every individual academic’s holistic research performance in New Zealand to test several common explanations for the gender pay gap in universities. We find a man’s odds of being ranked professor or associate professor are more than double a woman’s with similar recent research score, age, field, and university. We observe a lifetime gender pay gap of ~NZ$400,000, of which research score and age explain less than half. Our ability to examine the full spectrum of research performance allows us to reject the ‘male variability hypothesis’ theory that the preponderance of men amongst the ‘superstars’ explains the lifetime performance pay gap observed. Indeed women whose research career trajectories resemble men’s still get paid less than men. From 2003–12, women at many ranks improved their research scores by more than men, but moved up the academic ranks more slowly. We offer some possible explanations for our findings, and show that the gender gap in universities will never disappear in most academic fields if current hiring practices persist."
https://openalex.org/W3001704210,"Background Cyberbullying is a global public health concern with tremendous negative impacts, not only on the physical and mental health of students but also on their well-being and academic performance. However, there are very few studies on cyberbullying among university students, especially in Myanmar. This study aims to determine the percentage of university students who suffered cyberbullying victimization in the last 12 months, and the association between students’ socio-demographic characteristics, adverse events following cyberbullying and cyberbullying victimization. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among university students aged 18 years and older at one medical university in Magway, Myanmar. A total of 412 students (277 males and 135 females) participated in the study. Data were collected from August to September, 2018 using a self-administered questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analyses (models I and II) were performed to estimate the unadjusted (UOR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results In total, 40.8% of males and 51.1% of females in the study had suffered cyberbullying victimization in the past 12 months. In model I, students who had been studying at the university for 3 years or less (AOR = 1.81; 95% CI 1.14–2.85), and who had witnessed psychological, physical or sexual violence, or cyberbullying in their neighborhoods, (AOR = 2.95; 95% CI 1.48–5.91) were more likely to have suffered cyberbullying victimization in the past 12 months. In model II, being a victim of cyberbullying was associated with difficulties in concentrating and understanding lectures (AOR = 3.96; 95% CI 1.72–9.11), and substance abuse (AOR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.02–5.49). Non-resident students were at a higher risk of being cyberbullying victims than their resident peers (AOR = 1.86; 95% CI 1.04–3.34). Conclusion Two out of five students had suffered cyberbullying victimization in the past 12 months, and only half of the victims discussed their experience(s) with someone else. Students who suffered cyberbullying victimization faced academic difficulties and started or increased smoking, betel chewing or alcohol drinking. Counter measures to prevent and mitigate the adverse events related to cyberbullying victimization are urgently needed among university students in Myanmar. Periodic screening for cyberbullying, counseling services, cyber-safety educational programs, and awareness raising campaigns should be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W3001945533,"Sea level rise in the United States will lead to large scale migration in the future. We propose a framework to examine future climate migration patterns using models of human migration. Our framework requires that we distinguish between historical versus climate driven migration and recognizes how the impacts of climate change can extend beyond the affected area. We apply our framework to simulate how migration, driven by sea level rise, differs from baseline migration patterns. Specifically, we couple a sea level rise model with a data-driven model of human migration and future population projections, creating a generalized joint model of climate driven migration that can be used to simulate population distributions under potential future sea level rise scenarios. The results of our case study suggest that the effects of sea level rise are pervasive, expanding beyond coastal areas via increased migration, and disproportionately affecting some areas of the United States."
https://openalex.org/W3003076934,"Corylin is a naturally occurring flavonoid isolated from the fruit of Psoralea corylifolia L. (Fabaceae), which is a Chinese medicinal herb in treating osteoporosis. Although a variety of pharmacological activities of corylin have been reported, its osteogenic action and the underlying mechanism in bone development remain unclear. In the present study, the involvement of bone-specific genes in corylininduced differentiated osteoblasts was analyzed by RT-PCR, promoter-reporter assay, and Western blotting. In cultured osteoblasts, corylin-induced cell differentiation and mineralization, as well as increased the expressions of vital biological markers for osteogenesis, such as Runx2, Osterix, Col1, and ALP. Corylin was proposed to have dual pathways in triggering the osteoblastic differentiation. First, the osteogenic function of corylin acted through the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The nuclear translocation of β-catenin of cultured osteoblasts, as determined by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, was triggered by applied corylin, and which was blocked by DKK-1, an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Second, the application of corylin-induced estrogenic response in a dose-dependent manner, and which was blocked by ICI 182 780, an antagonist of estrogen receptor. Furthermore, the activation of Runx2 promoter by corylin was abolished by both DKK-1 and ICI 182,780, indicating that the corylin exhibited its osteogenic effect via estrogen and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. In addition, corylin regulated the metabolic profiles, as well as the membrane potential of mitochondria, in cultured osteoblasts. Corylin also stimulated the osteogenesis in bone micromass derived from mesenchymal progenitor cells. This study demonstrated the osteogenic activities of corylin in osteoblasts and micromass, suggesting that corylin has the potential to be developed as a novel pro-osteogenic agent in targeting for the treatment of osteoblast-mediated osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W3001749980,"The intracellular NOD-like receptor nucleotide-binding domain-like receptors Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) is a pivotal regulator of intestinal homeostasis through regulating a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The Jumonji domain-containing 3 (Jmjd3) plays important role in inflammatory responses and thus has been proposed as a novel attractive epigenetic target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. We here investigated whether targeting Jmjd3 regulates NLRP3 inflammasome during experimental colitis. Jmjd3 specific inhibitor GSK J4 or knocking down Jmjd3 significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and nigericin-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR analysis validated that GSK J4 rescued the decreased repressive H3K27me3 recruitment level on the promotors of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in LPS plus nigericin-induced macrophages. Nrf2 knockdown abolished NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Notably, oral administration of GSK J4 attenuated the disease progression in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis mouse model, including reduced disease activity index, improved body weight, rescued bowel shortening and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Overall, our study reveals that Jmjd3 is a potential epigenetic regulator for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), suggesting that Nrf2 is a potential target gene of Jmjd3 by mediating methylation status of trimethylated H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) in the promotor and is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thereby providing the platform for potential future therapeutic interventions in IBD."
https://openalex.org/W3000906837,"Objectives Knee joint distraction (KJD) has been evaluated as a joint-preserving treatment to postpone total knee arthroplasty in knee osteoarthritis patients in three clinical trials. Since 2014 the treatment is used in regular care in some hospitals, which might lead to a deviation from the original indication and decreased treatment outcome. In this study, baseline characteristics, complications and clinical benefit are compared between patients treated in regular care and in clinical trials. Methods In our hospital, 84 patients were treated in regular care for 6 weeks with KJD. Surgical details, complications, and range of motion were assessed from patient hospital charts. Patient-reported outcome measures were evaluated in regular care before and one year after treatment. Trial patients (n = 62) were treated and followed as described in literature. Results Patient characteristics were not significantly different between groups, except for distraction duration (regular care 45.3±4.3; clinical trials 48.1±8.1 days; p = 0.019). Pin tract infections were the most occurring complication (70% regular care; 66% clinical trials), but there was no significant difference in treatment complications between groups (p>0.1). The range of motion was recovered within a year after treatment for both groups. WOMAC questionnaires showed statistically and clinically significant improvement for both groups (both p<0.001 and >15 points in all subscales) and no significant differences between groups (all differences p>0.05). After one year, 70% of patients were responders (regular care 61%, trial 75%; p = 0.120). Neither regular care compared to clinical trial, nor any other characteristic could predict clinical response. Conclusions KJD as joint-preserving treatment in clinical practice, to postpone arthroplasty for end-stage knee osteoarthritis patient below the age of 65, results in an outcome similar to that thus far demonstrated in clinical trials. Longer follow-up in regular care is needed to test whether also long-term results remain beneficial and comparable to trial data."
https://openalex.org/W2995750730,"We used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to investigate the evolutionary history of domesticated tetraploid wheats. With a panel of 189 wild and domesticated wheats, we identified 1,172,469 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a read depth ≥3. Principal component analyses (PCAs) separated the Triticum turgidum and Triticum timopheevii accessions, as well as wild T. turgidum from the domesticated emmers and the naked wheats, showing that SNP typing by GBS is capable of providing robust information on the genetic relationships between wheat species and subspecies. The PCAs and a neighbour-joining analysis suggested that domesticated tetraploid wheats have closest affinity with wild emmers from the northern Fertile Crescent, consistent with the results of previous genetic studies on the origins of domesticated wheat. However, a more detailed examination of admixture and allele sharing between domesticates and different wild populations, along with genome-wide association studies (GWAS), showed that the domesticated tetraploid wheats have also received a substantial genetic input from wild emmers from the southern Levant. Taking account of archaeological evidence that tetraploid wheats were first cultivated in the southern Levant, we suggest that a pre-domesticated crop spread from this region to southeast Turkey and became mixed with a wild emmer population from the northern Fertile Crescent. Fixation of the domestication traits in this mixed population would account for the allele sharing and GWAS results that we report. We also propose that feralization of the component of the pre-domesticated population that did not acquire domestication traits has resulted in the modern wild population from southeast Turkey displaying features of both the domesticates and wild emmer from the southern Levant, and hence appearing to be the sole progenitor of domesticated tetraploids when the phylogenetic relationships are studied by methods that assume a treelike pattern of evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2804819160,"Measuring the diffusion of innovations from textual data sources besides patent data has not been studied extensively. However, early and accurate indicators of innovation and the recognition of trends in innovation are mandatory to successfully promote economic growth through technological progress via evidence-based policy making. In this study, we propose Paragraph Vector Topic Model (PVTM) and apply it to technology-related news articles to analyze innovation-related topics over time and gain insights regarding their diffusion process. PVTM represents documents in a semantic space, which has been shown to capture latent variables of the underlying documents, e.g., the latent topics. Clusters of documents in the semantic space can then be interpreted and transformed into meaningful topics by means of Gaussian mixture modeling. In using PVTM, we identify innovation-related topics from 170, 000 technology news articles published over a span of 20 years and gather insights about their diffusion state by measuring the topic importance in the corpus over time. Our results suggest that PVTM is a credible alternative to widely used topic models for the discovery of latent topics in (technology-related) news articles. An examination of three exemplary topics shows that innovation diffusion could be assessed using topic importance measures derived from PVTM. Thereby, we find that PVTM diffusion indicators for certain topics are Granger causal to Google Trend indices with matching search terms."
https://openalex.org/W3002522802,"Background The incidence, prediction and mortality outcomes of intraoperative and postoperative cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in surgical patients are under investigated and have not been studied concurrently in a single study. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data between 2008 and 2012. Firth’s penalized logistic regression was used to study the incidence and identify risk factors for intra- and postoperative CPR and 30-day mortality. simplified prediction model was constructed and internally validated to predict the studied outcomes. Results Among about 1.86 million non-cardiac operations, the incidence rate of intraoperative CPR was 0.03%, and for postoperative CPR was 0.33%. The 30-day mortality incidence rate was 1.25%. The incidence rate of events decreased overtime between 2008–2012. Of the 29 potential predictors, 14 were significant for intraoperative CPR, 23 for postoperative CPR, and 25 for 30-day mortality. The five strongest predictors (highest odd ratios) of intraoperative CPR were the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)/sepsis, surgery type, urgent/emergency case and anesthesia technique. Intraoperative CPR, ASA, age, functional status and end stage renal disease were the most significant predictors for postoperative CPR. The most significant predictors of 30-day mortality were ASA, age, functional status, SIRS/sepsis, and disseminated cancer. The predictions with the simplified five-factor model performed well and was comparable to the full prediction model. Postoperative cardiac arrest requiring CPR, compared to intraoperative, was associated with much higher mortality. Conclusions The incidence of cardiac arrest requiring CPR in surgical patients decreased overtime. Risk factors for intraoperative CPR, postoperative CPR and perioperative mortality are overlapped. We proposed a simplified approach compromised of five-factor model to identify patients at high risk. Postoperative, compare to intraoperative, cardiac arrest requiring CPR was associated with much higher mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3003023841,"A round-trip human mission to Mars is anticipated to last roughly three years. Spaceflight conditions are known to cause loss of bone mineral density (BMD) in astronauts, increasing bone fracture risk. There is an urgent need to understand BMD progression as a function of spaceflight time to minimize associated health implications and ensure mission success. Here we introduce a nonlinear mathematical model of BMD loss for candidate human missions to Mars: (i) Opposition class trajectory (400–600 days), and (ii) Conjunction class trajectory (1000–1200 days). Using femoral neck BMD data (N = 69) from astronauts after 132-day and 228-day spaceflight and the World Health Organization’s fracture risk recommendation, we predicted post-mission risk and associated osteopathology. Our model predicts 62% opposition class astronauts and 100% conjunction class astronauts will develop osteopenia, with 33% being at risk for osteoporosis. This model can help in implementing countermeasure strategies and inform space agencies’ choice of crew candidates."
https://openalex.org/W3001266181,"Gram-positive bacteria, including major clinical pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, are becoming increasingly drug-resistant. Their cell walls are composed of a thick layer of peptidoglycan (PG) modified by the attachment of wall teichoic acid (WTA), an anionic glycopolymer that is linked to pathogenicity and regulation of cell division and PG synthesis. The transfer of WTA from lipid carriers to PG, catalyzed by the LytR–CpsA–Psr (LCP) enzyme family, offers a unique extracellular target for the development of new anti-infective agents. Inhibitors of LCP enzymes have the potential to manage a wide range of bacterial infections because the target enzymes are implicated in the assembly of many other bacterial cell wall polymers, including capsular polysaccharide of streptococcal species and arabinogalactan of mycobacterial species. In this study, we present the first crystal structure of S. aureus LcpA with bound substrate at 1.9 Å resolution and those of Bacillus subtilis LCP enzymes, TagT, TagU, and TagV, in the apo form at 1.6–2.8 Å resolution. The structures of these WTA transferases provide new insight into the binding of lipid-linked WTA and enable assignment of the catalytic roles of conserved active-site residues. Furthermore, we identified potential subsites for binding the saccharide core of PG using computational docking experiments, and multiangle light-scattering experiments disclosed novel oligomeric states of the LCP enzymes. The crystal structures and modeled substrate-bound complexes of the LCP enzymes reported here provide insights into key features linked to substrate binding and catalysis and may aid the structure-guided design of specific LCP inhibitors.

The discovery of penicillin nearly a century ago ushered in an era of targeting bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) 2The abbreviations used are: PGpeptidoglycanLCPLytR-CpsA-PsrWTAwall teichoic acidCPcapsular polysaccharidePBPpenicillin-binding proteinsC10-PPgeranyl-pyrophosphateC55-Pundecaprenyl phosphateMurNAcN-acetylmuramic acidManNAcN-acetylmannosaminetriGlcNAcN,N′,N″-triacetylchitotriosePDBProtein Data BankSeMetselenomethionineTMtransmembraneRMSDroot-mean-square deviation. biosynthesis as an effective approach to combat a wide variety of bacterial infections. To survive the onslaught of β-lactams and other classes of typically bactericidal antibiotics, bacteria have evolved a myriad of resistance countermeasures in parallel. As a result, new therapeutic agents are now urgently needed, and their development will rely on extensive research efforts on additional bacterial targets. Wall teichoic acid (WTA) is a Gram-positive bacterial cell wall polymer that is covalently attached to the N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) C6-hydroxyl group of PG (Fig. S1). The inhibition of WTA biosynthesis is an attractive therapeutic approach because methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus deficient in the production of WTAs are known to be resensitized to certain classes of β-lactam antibiotics (1Campbell J. Singh A.K. Santa Maria Jr., J.P. Kim Y. Brown S. Swoboda J.G. Mylonakis E. Wilkinson B.J. Walker S.

This intriguing phenomenon is believed to stem from the role of WTA in guiding PG cross-linking through spatiotemporal localization of certain penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (1Campbell J. Singh A.K. Santa Maria Jr., J.P. Kim Y. Brown S. Swoboda J.G. Mylonakis E. Wilkinson B.J. Walker S.

The absence of WTA disables these select classes of PBPs through mislocalization and sensitizes the organism to β-lactams that target unaffected PBPs. Another physiological role of WTA is the regulation of cell division through localization of autolysins to the division septum for PG breakdown (4Schlag M. Biswas R. Krismer B. Kohler T. Zoll S.

In addition, this polymer is linked to pathogenicity because WTA-deficient mutants are defective in biofilm formation, host cell adherence, and colonization (5Holland L.M. Conlon B. O'Gara J.P.

The ribitol-phosphate polymer of S. aureus WTA is anchored to PG through a sugar-based linkage unit comprised of phosphate–GlcNAc–N-acetylmannosamine–[glycerol-phosphate]2 (Fig. S1). The transfer of WTA to PG is catalyzed on the outer leaflet of the cytosolic membrane by members of the LytR–CpsA–Psr (LCP) protein family that are unique to predominantly Gram-positive bacteria (9Kawai Y.

The LCP family represents an attractive class of drug targets in that the soluble catalytic region is on the extracellular face of the cytosolic membrane, and there are no mammalian orthologs (13Hübscher J.

Furthermore, LCP enzymes are involved in the PG attachment of not only WTA but other secondary polymers of therapeutic interest, including Streptococcus pneumonia capsular polysaccharide (CP) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis arabinogalactan (14Eberhardt A.

Multiple copies of the lcp gene are often found in Gram-positive bacteria, and the gene products display catalytic and functional differences.

In S. aureus, LcpA was discovered to be the primary WTA transferase, whereas LcpC acts as the primary CP transferase (18Schaefer K. Matano L.M. Qiao Y. Kahne D. Walker S.

The disaccharide lipid-linked PG precursor, lipid II, was demonstrated to be a substrate of S. aureus LcpC but not for LcpA (18Schaefer K. Matano L.M. Qiao Y. Kahne D. Walker S.

In addition, S. aureus LcpB was found to be incapable of utilizing cross-linked S. aureus PG as the acceptor substrate, suggesting that the attachment of WTA occurs prior to cross-linking of PG strands (20Schaefer K. Owens T.W. Kahne D. Walker S. Substrate preferences establish the order of cell wall assembly in Staphylococcus aureus.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140 (29402087): 2442-244510.1021/jacs.7b13551Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast, a study conducted on B. subtilis LCP enzymes demonstrated WTA ligation to mature cross-linked B. subtilis PG in vitro (16Gale R.T. Li F.K.K. Sun T. Strynadka N.C.J. Brown E.D.

Given the observed functional variations among species, understanding the underlying molecular details becomes important. Prior crystallographic studies have been conducted on LCP enzymes with S. pneumoniae Cps2A and B. subtilis TagT characterized in complex with analogs of the polyprenyl substrate (Table S1). In the former, the bound lipids lack the saccharide headgroup that differentiates CP/WTA precursors from lipid II (9Kawai Y. Marles-Wright J. Cleverley R.M. Emmins R. Ishikawa S. Kuwano M. Heinz N. Bui N.K. Hoyland C.N. Ogasawara N. Lewis R.J. Vollmer W. Daniel R.A. Errington J.

More recently, C30-PP–GlcNAc and C30-PP–GlcNAc–ManNAc were successfully co-crystallized with B. subtilis TagT; however, the saccharide headgroups were found in different orientations, and the expected specificity determining polar contacts between the saccharide substrate moieties and the enzyme active site were not observed (20Schaefer K. Owens T.W. Kahne D. Walker S. Substrate preferences establish the order of cell wall assembly in Staphylococcus aureus.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140 (29402087): 2442-244510.1021/jacs.7b13551Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A notable structural variant of LCP enzymes is that of Actinomyces oris LcpA, which possesses unique structural features around the active site presumably associated with binding target proteins rather than PG for glycosylation (21Siegel S.D. Amer B.R. Wu C. Sawaya M.R. Gosschalk J.E. Clubb R.T. Ton-That H. Structure and mechanism of LcpA, a phosphotransferase that mediates glycosylation of a Gram-positive bacterial cell wall–anchored protein.MBio. 2019; 10 (30782654): e01580-18PubMed Google Scholar). Further structural characterization of LCP enzymes is required to investigate PG binding and to clarify the structural relationship between the donor lipid headgroup and the enzyme. In this study, we present four crystal structures of S. aureus and B. subtilis LCP enzymes for a comparative analysis that provides the molecular basis of residues assessed in published mutagenesis studies. Importantly, our structure of S. aureus LcpA complexed to C40-PP–GlcNAc provides clarity on the orientation of the saccharide headgroup and reveals an interface reliant on van der Waals and hydrophobic contacts rather than direct polar interactions. Furthermore, the structure of S. aureus LcpA provides a clinically relevant target for structure-guided design of inhibitors. We complement our crystallographic work by modeling PG-bound complexes, and we report hitherto unknown oligomeric states of various LCP enzymes in solution. Our crystallographic study yielded the first structure of the primary S. aureus WTA transferase, LcpASA (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The crystallized enzyme captured C40-PP–GlcNAc, an endogenous lipid with central features in keeping with the natural lipid donor substrate. The construct (residues 80–327; ΔTM) used for crystallization encompasses the extracellular catalytic region, known as the LCP domain, and lacks the single N-terminal transmembrane anchor (Fig. S2a). Our structure of LcpASA was solved by molecular replacement to 1.9 Å resolution, providing an excellent template for future structure-based drug design work.Table 1X-ray data collection and refinement statisticsS. aureus LcpAB. subtilis TagTB. subtilis TagU (SeMet)B. subtilis TagVResidues80–32746–32262–30672–332Protein Data Bank code6UEX6UF56UF66UF3Data collectionWavelength (Å)0.979490.979640.979490.97949SpacegroupC2221P41212P3221P212121Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)89.25, 90.54, 94.7565.66, 65.66, 143.0748.79, 48.79, 234.2740.99, 66.10, 81.72a, b, c (°)90, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 90, 12090, 90, 90Resolution (Å)aThe values in parentheses represent the highest-resolution shell.47.38–1.90 (1.97–1.90)48.37–2.80 (2.90–2.80)41.58–2.20 (2.28–2.20)36.64–1.6 (1.66–1.60)CC1/20.998 (0.696)0.997 (0.655)0.999 (0.862)1 (0.709)Rpim0.02126 (0.6351)0.05905 (0.5196)0.02982 (0.523)0.02434 (0.5561)Rmeas0.05442 (1.643)0.2232 (1.989)0.09296 (1.665)0.0674 (1.561)I/σI16.31 (1.36)13.10 (1.55)14.69 (1.46)19.00 (1.50)Completeness (%)99.84 (99.80)99.84 (99.87)99.59 (99.11)99.82 (99.87)Redundancy6.6 (6.6)13.9 (14.4)9.7 (10.0)7.6 (7.7)RefinementResolution (Å)47.38–1.9048.37–2.8041.58–2.2036.64–1.60No. of reflections30,547 (3015)8230 (794)17,404 (1671)29,994 (2959)Rwork/Rfreeb5% of reflections were excluded from refinement and used to calculate Rfree.0.1922/0.22580.2307/0.27660.2445/0.25880.2004/0.2288No. of atoms2063188118112133Protein1896187917701966Ligand/ion1100360Water5725167B factors (Å2)67.3263.1293.2536.23Protein65.9863.1592.5735.69Ligand/ion91.91–129.37–Water64.6243.6673.0642.53RMSDBond lengths (Å)0.0080.0050.0060.006Bond angles (°)1.191.061.081.04Ramachandran (%)Favored97.9694.9896.4198.79Allowed2.045.023.591.21Outliers0000MolProbityClashscore3.355.898.093.85a The values in parentheses represent the highest-resolution shell.b 5% of reflections were excluded from refinement and used to calculate Rfree. Open table in a new tab The LCP domain of LcpASA is comprised of a six-stranded β-sheet sandwiched between multiple α-helices and several double-stranded β-sheets (Fig. 1a and Fig. S2b). A large hydrophobic lipid-binding pocket with a narrow opening and a wide base is formed by the central β-sheet and helices 3–7 (Fig. 1b). An electropositive region for binding the pyrophosphate moiety of the lipid donor substrate is found at the entrance of the hydrophobic pocket highlighting the location of the active site. LcpASA shows the highest overall structural similarity to Enterococcus faecalis EF0465 with an RMSD of 2.5 Å for 227 Cα pairs, indicating regions of significant difference (Table S1). However, structural comparison of just the highly conserved active-site residues shows that LcpASA is most similar to apo and C30-PP–GlcNAc–ManNAc–bound TagTBS with a closely matched RMSD of 0.85 Å for 10 Cα pairs in both instances and 1.3–1.6 Å for 44 common side chain heavy atoms therein. The active site of LcpASA is surrounded by four regions, designated here as regions A (residues 92–100), B (residues 188–201), C (residues 217–224), and D (residues 296–312), that display structural variability when compared with the LCP enzymes of other species (Fig. 1a). To this end, we have expanded our structural understanding of LCP enzymes by solving three additional structures from the prototypical Gram-positive bacterium, B. subtilis (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The first is the novel structure of TagUBS (residues 62–306; selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted) phased by single isomorphous replacement and refined to 2.2 Å resolution. Additional insights into the architecture of the active site are provided by the structure of TagVBS (residues 72–332; 1.6 Å resolution) at a higher resolution than previously reported (2.6 Å resolution) and the structure of TagTBS (residues 46–322; 2.8 Å resolution) with additional electron density for a previously disordered and unmodeled region in the apo structure. The electrostatic surfaces of the LCP enzymes are highly variable in addition to the electropositive region formed by conserved arginine residues at the active site. This electropositive region becomes more difficult to observe when the guanidinium side chains are not localized by a pyrophosphate group (Fig. 2c). Between our four structures, the most significant difference in secondary structure is found in region B, where LcpASA has a large loop, TagTBS has an α-helix, and both TagUBS and TagVBS have a double-stranded β-sheet (Figs. 1a and 2a). Regions A and C encompass flexible loops, and region D adopts a two-stranded β-sheet with an enrichment of aromatic residues that we predict bind to the carbohydrate groups of PG. In the structure of TagUBS, the rearrangements of helices 3–7 on one side of the central β-sheet resulted in the collapse of the lipid-binding site (Fig. 2b). These structural differences are facilitated by the association of two protein molecules forming a modest interfacial surface area of 760 Å2 across a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis at one end of the lipid-binding site (helices 6 and 7 and β-strand 9) (Fig. S2c). The association is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions mainly consisting of aromatic residues from the interior of the hydrophobic pocket. Notably, several crystal structures of LCP enzymes, including TagTBS here, display disorder of helix 6 (Fig. 2a). The exposure of the hydrophobic core to bulk solvent may be the driving force behind the dimerization of TagUBS. The hydrophobic and aromatic nature of this exposed region also suggests a possible surface for association with membrane. In the structure of S. aureus LcpA, we have fortuitously captured a lipid substrate produced by the overexpression strain BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli for the synthesis of O7-specific lipopolysaccharide (22Kim H. Kim S. Yoon S.H. Metabolic network reconstruction and phenome analysis of the industrial microbe, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3).PLoS One. 2018; 13 (30240424): e020437510.1371/journal.pone.0204375PubMed Google Scholar). The clear density at the extended hydrophobic lipid-binding pocket (surface area ≈ 680 Å2; volume ≈ 550 Å3) allowed unambiguous modeling of a lipid tail and a monosaccharide-pyrophosphate headgroup (Fig. S2d). The electron density of the monosaccharide is in keeping with a GlcNAc moiety commonly appended to polyprenyl groups through the action of WecA in E. coli (23Alexander D.C. Valvano M.A. Role of the rfe gene in the biosynthesis of the Escherichia coli O7-specific lipopolysaccharide and other O-specific polysaccharides containing N-acetylglucosamine.J.

The weak additional density extending from the C3-hydroxyl group of GlcNAc may indicate the presence of galactose presumably appended to GlcNAc by the enzyme WbbD in E. coli (24Riley J.G. Menggad M.

The interactions between LcpASA and C40-PP–GlcNAc are shown in Fig. 1c. Residues surrounding the lipid tail display low sequence conservation but are largely hydrophobic. Notably, the bulky aromatic side chain of Phe-171 introduces a kink at the third prenyl moiety, whereas the wide base of the pocket induces a twist in the lipid backbone to accommodate the remainder of the lipid tail. Invariant arginine residues form a positively charged entrance to the hydrophobic pocket, where their guanidinyl groups form salt bridges with the pyrophosphate moiety of the polyprenyl. Arg-99 and Arg-216 are in contact with the α-phosphate group and Arg-122, Arg-218, and Arg-227 are in contact with the β-phosphate group in keeping with earlier mutagenesis studies showing their importance in growth and activity in various species (summarized in Table S2) (9Kawai Y.

The orientation of the lipid-bound GlcNAc moiety is stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bond (3.0 Å) between the nitrogen atom of the N-acetyl group and a phosphoryl oxygen of the α-phosphate group (Fig. 1c). In addition, the position of the GlcNAc moiety is stabilized by hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions between the N-acetyl group and a shallow pocket outlined by residues Asn-194, Ile-195, Arg-216, Phe-217, Arg-218, and His-219 of regions B and C (Fig. 1d). These observations are also supported by the structure of TagTBS bound to C30-PP–GlcNAc–ManNAc (Fig. S3). The lack of specific interactions between the enzyme and the N-acetyl group likely allows for the significant observed differences in the secondary structure of region B as mentioned above. Region C possesses two highly conserved residues, a pyrophosphate-binding arginine (Arg-218) and an aspartate (Asp-224). The loop of region C is commonly held away from the active site by a resident acidic residue that forms a salt bridge with a nearby basic residue (Fig. S4). Region C is fully modeled in our structures of LcpASA, TagTBS, and TagUBS. A comparison between all available LCP enzyme structures reveals that ordering of the loop in region C depends heavily on the extension of helix 5 beyond"
https://openalex.org/W3001695754,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled the discovery of candidate markers that play significant roles in various complex traits in plants. Recently, with increased interest in the search for candidate markers, studies on epistatic interactions between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers have also increased, thus enabling the identification of more candidate markers along with GWAS on single-variant-additive-effect. Here, we focused on the identification of candidate markers associated with flowering time in soybean (Glycine max). A large population of 2,662 cultivated soybean accessions was genotyped using the 180k Axiom® SoyaSNP array, and the genomic architecture of these accessions was investigated to confirm the population structure. Then, GWAS was conducted to evaluate the association between SNP markers and flowering time. A total of 93 significant SNP markers were detected within 59 significant genes, including E1 and E3, which are the main determinants of flowering time. Based on the GWAS results, multilocus epistatic interactions were examined between the significant and non-significant SNP markers. Two significant and 16 non-significant SNP markers were discovered as candidate markers affecting flowering time via interactions with each other. These 18 candidate SNP markers mapped to 18 candidate genes including E1 and E3, and the 18 candidate genes were involved in six major flowering pathways. Although further biological validation is needed, our results provide additional information on the existing flowering time markers and present another option to marker-assisted breeding programs for regulating flowering time of soybean."
https://openalex.org/W3001030586,"CD44 molecule (CD44) is a well-known surface glycoprotein on tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem cells. However, its utility as a therapeutic target for managing metastases remains to be fully evaluated. We previously demonstrated that CD44 mediates homophilic interactions for circulating tumor cell (CTC) cluster formation, which enhances cancer stemness and metastatic potential in association with an unfavorable prognosis. Furthermore, CD44 self-interactions activate the P21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) signaling pathway. Here, we further examined the biochemical properties of CD44 in homotypic tumor cell aggregation. The standard CD44 form (CD44s) mainly assembled as intercellular homodimers (trans-dimers) in tumor clusters rather than intracellular dimers (cis-dimers) present in single cells. Machine learning–based computational modeling combined with experimental mutagenesis tests revealed that the extracellular Domains I and II of CD44 are essential for its trans-dimerization and predicted high-score residues to be required for dimerization. Substitutions of 10 these residues in Domain I (Ser-45, Glu-48, Phe-74, Cys-77, Arg-78, Tyr-79, Ile-88, Arg-90, Asn-94, and Cys-97) or 5 residues in Domain II (Ile-106, Tyr-155, Val-156, Gln-157, and Lys-158) abolished CD44 dimerization and reduced tumor cell aggregation in vitro. Importantly, the substitutions in Domain II dramatically inhibited lung colonization in mice. The CD44 dimer-disrupting substitutions decreased downstream PAK2 activation without affecting the interaction between CD44 and PAK2, suggesting that PAK2 activation in tumor cell clusters is CD44 trans-dimer–dependent. These results shed critical light on the biochemical mechanisms of CD44-mediated tumor cell cluster formation and may help inform the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent tumor cluster formation and block cluster-mediated metastases."
https://openalex.org/W3002251030,"Carrion of large animals is an extremely nutrient rich, ephemeral resource that is essential for many species, but is scarce in the anthropogenic Western-European landscape due to legislative restrictions. Rewilding, a novel conservation strategy that aims at restoring natural processes with minimal human intervention, is increasing in popularity and could lead to increased carrion availability in the landscape. It is therefore important to understand the effects of carrion on biodiversity. We investigated the direct and delayed (five months) effects of red deer (Cervus elaphus) carcasses on plants and arthropods in the Oostvaardersplassen, the Netherlands, one of the oldest rewilding sites in Europe. Specifically, we tested whether carrion has a positive direct effect on the abundances and diversity of various arthropod functional groups, as well as a delayed effect on the vegetation and arthropods through the increased nutrient availability. During the active decomposition stage in spring, we, not surprisingly, observed higher abundances of carrion associated species (scavengers and their specialized predators) at the carrion sites than at control sites without carrion, but no higher abundances of predators or detritivores. In late summer, after near-complete decomposition, plant biomass was five times higher, and nutritional plant quality (C:N ratio) was higher at the carrion sites than at the control sites. Arthropod abundance and diversity were also manifold higher, owing to higher numbers of herbivorous and predatory species. Regression analysis showed that abundances of herbivores and detritivores were positively related to plant biomass, and predator abundances were positively related to abundances of herbivores and detritivores, suggesting bottom-up effects propagating through the food chain. Our results show that even in a naturally nutrient-rich ecosystem like the Oostvaardersplassen, carrion can have strong positive effects on local plant biomass and nutritional quality and arthropod abundances, lasting the whole growing season. We found evidence that these effects were first directly caused by the presence of carrion, and later by the enhanced nutrient availability in the soil. This highlights the importance of the indirect pathways by which carrion can structure arthropod communities."
https://openalex.org/W3002625815,"The prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy and breast cancer are both high among women living in Karachi, Pakistan.A matched case control study was conducted in two hospitals of Karachi, Pakistan to evaluate the association of vitamin D (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D) concentrations, vitamin D supplementation and sun exposure with breast cancer among Pakistani women. A total of 411 newly diagnosed histologically confirmed primary breast cancer cases were enrolled and 784 controls, free of breast and any other cancers, were matched by age (year of birth ± 5 years), residence in the same geographic area and study site. Information was collected on sociodemographic history, history of vitamin D supplementation, past medical and obstetrical history, family history of breast cancer, sun exposure history, histopathology reports and anthropometric measurement and venous blood was collected to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration.Compared to patients with sufficient serum vitamin D (>30 ng/ml), women with serum vitamin D deficiency (<20ng/ml), had a higher risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.65, 95%CI: 1.10, 2.50). Women with history of vitamin D supplementation one year prior to enrollment, had significant protective effect against breast cancer (OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.43).Serum vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased risk of breast cancer, while vitamin D supplementation was associated with decreased risk of breast cancer. In Pakistani women, where vitamin D deficiency is common, raising and maintaining serum vitamin D at population level is a safe and affordable strategy. It may play a role in reducing the incidence of both vitamin D deficiency and breast cancer, particularly among poor women where the breast cancer mortality is highest due to limited resources for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The effects of vitamin D with regard to breast cancer risk in Karachi Pakistan should be further evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W3001765020,"Context and objective As elsewhere, disadvantaged children in Senegal are those most affected by dental diseases and difficulties in obtaining dental care. Studies conducted mainly in developed countries suggest that a low level of mothers’ OHL is correlated with poor oral health of their children. The objective of this study is to estimate the level of mothers’ OHL in Senegal and its relationto the dental health of their children. Methods This cross-sectional epidemiological survey took place among 315 children aged from 3 to 9 years old and their mothers. It estimated the children’s dental health status by clinical examination which used a disposable examination kit and a headlamp, took place at the child’s home, in the mother’s presence. Examiners interviewing the mothers administered the Oral Health Literacy-Adult Questionnaire to determine their OHL and questioned them further about their social characteristics and their children’s dental health behaviour. Logistic regression and correlations were used for the statistical analysis. Results The OHL score ranges from 0 to 17; mothers’ mean score was 6.5 (±3.1) and 56.5% had a low score (below the median). The prevalence of dental caries in children was 64.8%. Mothers’ high OHL is associated with children caries free and low prevalence of dental caries. The logistic regression showed a significantly protective relation between children’s dental caries and mothers’ high OHL scores (mean score 12–17) (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.29–0.88), high educational level (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23–0.76) and a high level of social contact (OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.15–0.63). The structural analysis showed that OHL was significantly correlated with both the mothers’ social position (r = 0.61 and P<0.001) and the children’s caries (r = -0.26 and P<0.001). Conclusion The OHL level of Senegalese mothers was significantly associated with their children’s dental caries. Improving mothers’ OHL might therefore help strengthen their capacities to promote oral health, thus helping to improve their children’s dental health and reduce inequalities."
https://openalex.org/W3001986102,"Introduction District health managers play a pivotal role in the delivery of basic health services in many countries, including Ghana, as they are responsible for converting inputs and resources such as, staff, supplies and equipment into effective services that are responsive to population needs. Weak management capacity among local health managers has been suggested as a major obstacle for responsive health service delivery. However, evidence on district health managers’ competencies and its association with health system performance is scarce. Aim To examine managerial capacity among district health managers and its association with health system performance in six districts in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Methods Fifty-nine district health managers’ in six different performing districts in the Eastern Region of Ghana completed a self-administered questionnaire measuring their management competencies and skills. In addition, the participants provided information on their socio-demographic background; previous management experience and training; the extent of available management support systems, and the dynamics within their district health management teams. A non-parametric one-way analysis was applied to test the association between management capacity and district performance, which was measured by 17 health indicators. Results Shortcomings within different aspects of district management were identified, however there were no significant differences observed in the availability of support systems, characteristics and qualifications of district health managers across the different performing districts. Overall management capacity among district health managers were significantly higher in high performing districts compared with lower performing districts (p = 0.02). Furthermore, district health managers in better performing districts reported a higher extent of teamwork (p = 0.02), communication within their teams (p<0.01) and organizational commitment (p<0.01) compared with lower performing districts. Conclusion The findings demonstrate individual and institutional capacity needs, and highlights the importance of developing management competencies and skills as well as positive team dynamics among health managers at district level."
https://openalex.org/W3002317016,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) express Toll like receptors (TLRs) that modulate the immune response by production of type I interferons. Here, we report that sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) which produces the bioactive sphingolipid metabolite, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), plays a critical role in the pDC functions and interferon production. Although dispensable for the pDC development, SphK1 is essential for the pDC activation and production of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulated by TLR7/9 ligands. SphK1 interacts with TLRs and specific inhibition or deletion of SphK1 in pDCs mitigates uptake of CpG oligonucleotide ligands by TLR9 ligand. In the pristane-induced murine lupus model, pharmacological inhibition of SphK1 or its genetic deletion markedly decreased the IFN signature, pDC activation, and glomerulonephritis. Moreover, increases in the SphK1 expression and S1P levels were observed in human lupus patients. Taken together, our results indicate a pivotal regulatory role for the SphK1/S1P axis in maintaining the balance between immunosurveillance and immunopathology and suggest that specific SphK1 inhibitors might be a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of type I IFN-linked autoimmune disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3002271205,"The circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP) are major targets for pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine development. However, the CSP-based vaccine RTS,S provides only marginal protection, highlighting the need for innovative vaccine design and development. Here we design and characterize expression and folding of P. berghei (Pb) and P. falciparum (Pf) TRAP-CSP fusion proteins, and evaluate immunogenicity and sterilizing immunity in mice. TRAP N-terminal domains were fused to the CSP C-terminal αTSR domain with or without the CSP repeat region, expressed in mammalian cells, and evaluated with or without N-glycan shaving. Pb and Pf fusions were each expressed substantially better than the TRAP or CSP components alone; furthermore, the fusions but not the CSP component could be purified to homogeneity and were well folded and monomeric. As yields of TRAP and CSP fragments were insufficient, we immunized BALB/c mice with Pb TRAP-CSP fusions in AddaVax adjuvant and tested the effects of absence or presence of the CSP repeats and absence or presence of high mannose N-glycans on total antibody titer and protection from infection by mosquito bite both 2.5 months and 6 months after the last immunization. Fusions containing the repeats were completely protective against challenge and re-challenge, while those lacking repeats were significantly less effective. These results correlated with higher total antibody titers when repeats were present. Our results show that TRAP-CSP fusions increase protein antigen production, have the potential to yield effective vaccines, and also guide design of effective proteins that can be encoded by nucleic acid-based and virally vectored vaccines."

Sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) is involved in inflammatory diseases such as obesity and diabetes mellitus by regulation of the SM/ceramide balance. However, the involvement of SMS2 in TME formation and metastasis is largely unknown. Here, we report that SMS2-deficient (SMS2-KO) mice show suppressed the EL4 cell infiltration to liver and prolonged survival time. ICAM-1 was identified as a candidate for the inhibition of TME formation in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (tMEFs) from mRNA array analysis for CAMs. Reduced SM/ceramide balance in SMS2-KO tMEFs suppressed the attachment of EL4 cells through transcriptional reduction of ICAM-1 by the inhibition of NF-κB activation. TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation and subsequent induction of ICAM-1 were suppressed in SMS2-KO tMEFs but restored by SMS2 re-introduction. In the EL4 cell infiltration mouse model, EL4 injection increased ICAM-1 expression in WT liver but not in SMS2-KO mouse liver. Therefore, inhibition of SMS2 may be a therapeutic target to suppress the infiltration of malignant lymphoma."
https://openalex.org/W3002255763,"Stress is prevalent in modern society and can affect human health through its effects on appetite. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to clarify the neural mechanisms by which acute stress affects appetite in healthy, non-obese males during fasting. In total, 22 volunteers participated in two experiments (stress and control conditions) on different days. The participants performed a stress-inducing speech-and-mental-arithmetic task under both conditions, and then viewed images of food, during which, their neural activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). In the stress condition, the participants were told to perform the speech-and-mental-arithmetic task again subsequently to viewing the food images; however, another speech-and-mental-arithmetic task was not performed actually. Subjective levels of stress and appetite were then assessed using a visual analog scale. Electrocardiography was performed to assess the index of heart rate variability reflecting sympathetic nerve activity. The findings showed that subjective levels of stress and sympathetic nerve activity were increased in the MEG session in the stress condition, whereas appetite gradually increased in the MEG session only in the control condition. The decrease in alpha band power in the frontal pole caused by viewing the food images was greater in the stress condition than in the control condition. These findings suggest that acute stress can suppress the increase of appetite, and this suppression is associated with the frontal pole. The results of the present study may provide valuable clues to gain a further understanding of the neural mechanisms by which acute stress affects appetite. However, since the stress examined in the present study was related to the expectation of forthcoming stressful event, our present findings may not be generalized to the stress unrelated to the expectation of forthcoming stressful event."

https://openalex.org/W3001461358,"Although the key role of renal fibrosis in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is well known, the causes of renal fibrosis are not fully clarified. In this study, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), a mammalian transcription factor, was highly expressed in fibrotic kidney of CKD patients. Concordantly, the expression level of IRF-1 was significantly elevated in the kidney of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and Adriamycin nephropathy (ADR) mice. In tubular epithelial cells, overexpression of IRF-1 could induce profibrotic markers expression, which accompanied by dramatic downregulation of Klotho, an important inhibitor of renal fibrosis. Luciferase reporter analysis and ChIP assay revealed that IRF-1 repressed Klotho expression by downregulation of C/EBP-β, which regulates Klotho gene transcription via directly binding to its promoter. Further investigation showed that tumor necrosis factor-alpha may be an important inducement for the increase of IRF-1 in tubular epithelial cells after UUO and genetic deletion of IRF-1 attenuated renal fibrosis in UUO mice. Hence, these findings demonstrate that IRF-1 contributes to the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis by downregulation of Klotho, and suppresses IRF-1 may be a potential therapeutic target for CKD."

The transmembrane domain (TM) mediates GLP-1R homodimerization, which modulates its ligand binding and signaling. We investigated the possible involvement of the N-terminal extracellular domain (NTD) in dimerization/oligomerization and dimer-associated ligand binding by NanoLuc Binary Technology (NanoBiT). With improved NanoBiT detection using a decreasing substrate concentration, the negative cooperativity of ligand binding to the NTD was confirmed by accelerated dissociation and Scatchard analysis. The dimerization/oligomerization of the isolated NTD was observed by NanoBiT and validated by analytical ultracentrifugation, deriving the comparable dimerization affinity (~105  M-1 ). The NTD was also involved in the dimerization/oligomerization of the full-length GLP-1R with mutated TM4 at the cellular level. In an analysis of the parameters of the NTD binding, the Kd for the probe GLP-1 (7-36, A8G) was similar (6-8 μM) in both the 1:1 binding model and the receptor dimerization model. Compared with GLP-1 and dulaglutide, exenatide showed two-site binding with Ki values of 1.4 pM and 8.7 nM. Our study indicates the involvement of NTD in the GLP-1R dimerization/oligomerization and suggests that further investigations on the role in other family B GPCRs are needed."

We analysed them using partial sequences of two mitochondrial genes, 16S rDNA and Cytochrome Oxidase I, and classical morphological observations. Our molecular results confirmed that the two populations corresponded to two different species, with PTP species delimitation values ranging from 0.973 (long–bodied species) to 0.999 (short–bodied species). Morphologically, the short–bodied species resembles the recently redescribed M. sanguinea (Montagu, 1813), but differs mainly in having some parapodia with two subacicular hooks (one bidentate and one unidentate) and three types of pectinate chaetae, Two isodont present all along the body, and one particularly large anodont asymmetric appearing only from mid–posterior parapodia. The long–bodied species resembles Marphysa aegypti Elgetany, El-Ghobashy, Ghoneim and Struck, 2018 both in size and in having very robust, unidentate subacicular hooks (single in most parapodia, two–both similar in size and form–in some posterior parapodia), but differs, among other features, in the maxillary formula, the number of acicula per parapodia and the number and shape of pectinate chaetae. Accordingly, we are here fully illustrating and formally describing the two Iberian populations as Marphysa gaditana sp. nov. (short–bodied) and Marphysa chirigota sp. nov. (long–bodied) and we are emending the description of M. aegypti based on our revision of the type material. Also, we discuss on the distribution of the species of the sanguinea–group and on the relevancy of taxonomically robust studies when dealing with species of commercial interest having the potential of being globally spread through human activities, as well as on the misunderstandings caused by the incorrect use of the “cosmopolitan species” concept."

To better understand DM selectivity, here we developed a real-time fluorescence anisotropy assay to delineate the pMHCII intrinsic stability, DM-binding affinity, and catalytic turnover, independent kinetic parameters of HLA-DM enzymatic activity. We analyzed prominent pMHCII contacts by differentiating the kinetic parameters in pMHCII homologs, observing that peptide interactions throughout the MHCII-binding cleft influence both the rate of peptide dissociation from the DM-pMHCII catalytic complex and the binding affinity of HLA-DM for a pMHCII. We show that the intrinsic stability of a pMHCII linearly correlates with DM catalytic turnover, but is nonlinearly correlated with its binding affinity. Surprisingly, interactions at the peptides N terminus up to and including MHCII position one (P1) anchor affected the catalytic turnover, suggesting that the active DM-pMHCII catalytic complex operates on pMHCII complexes with full peptide occupancy.

HLA-DM is structurally homologous to classical MHCII molecules. Despite the similarity, DM is unable to associate with peptide antigens due to the near-complete occlusion of the peptide-binding cleft (14Mosyak L. Zaller D.M. Wiley D.C. The structure of HLA-DM, the peptide exchange catalyst that loads antigen onto class II MHC molecules during antigen presentation.Immunity. 1998; 9 (9768757): 377-38310.1016/S1074-7613(00)80620-2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Classical MHCII molecules associate with peptide cargo through a network of MHCII conserved hydrogen bonds with the peptide main chain and side chain occupancy of several anchor pockets that vary in size and chemical features (Fig. S1, A and B). Relative peptide occupancy of these pockets within the binding cleft designates peptide anchor residues at positions 1 (P1), 4 (P4), 6 (P6), 7 (P7), and 9 (P9). Stable peptide-MHCII complexes are formed when anchor pockets are occupied with chemically and structurally compatible side chains. These optimal amino acid residues define the peptide-binding motif of the MHCII. HLA-DM encodes an endogenous signal that directs steady-state localization into late endosomal MHC class II compartments (MIIC) where antigen processing occurs (15Bikoff E.K. Huang L.Y.

Classical MHCII dimers instead associate with the invariant chain (li) chaperone protein to facilitate transport into the MIIC where resident cathepsins process the invariant chain protein into the class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP), converting all li-MHCII trimers into CLIP-MHCII complexes (17Ghosh P. Amaya M. Mellins E. Wiley D.C. The structure of an intermediate in class II MHC maturation: CLIP bound to HLA-DR3.Nature. 1995; 378 (7477400): 457-46210.1038/378457a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). These complexes are the earliest that DM encounters during the 2–4 h dwell time within the MIIC. To promote effective immune surveillance, DM must first catalyze the removal of CLIP and enhance the loading of antigenic peptides onto an MHCII (4Sherman M.A. Weber D.A. Jensen P.E. DM enhances peptide binding to class II MHC by release of invariant chain-derived peptide.Immunity. 1995; 3 (7648393): 197-20510.1016/1074-7613(95)90089-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 5Denzin L.K.

Throughout the endosomal dwell time, DM continues to catalyze peptide exchange through a mechanism that involves a transient interaction with the pMHCII complex. HLA-DM's enzymatic activity varies with each pMHCII species, such that peptide exchange is markedly enhanced for some pMHCII complexes, whereas others remain relatively unaffected (8Weber D.A.

This functional variability imposes a bias on the pMHCII that skews the repertoire of foreign and self-derived peptides that are presented to CD4+ T cells for activation or tolerance induction. It is through this effect that HLA-DM is said to edit the pMHCII repertoire that is presented on the cell surface. Although a large body of evidence demonstrates a central role for HLA-DM in shaping T cell immunity, neither DM's catalytic mechanism nor the pMHCII structural or chemical determinants that govern differential susceptibility to DM editing are well-understood (4Sherman M.A. Weber D.A.

Early investigations reported that in the absence of HLA-DM, empty MHCII molecules rapidly transitioned into an unreceptive peptide-binding conformation (22Rabinowitz J.D. Vrljic M. Kasson P.M. Liang M.N. Busch R. Boniface J.J. Davis M.M. McConnell H.M.

In the presence of HLA-DM, a highly receptive peptide-binding state was maintained. These studies led to the proposal that DM accelerates peptide loading by stabilizing a peptide-receptive transition state that is maintained until a suitable peptide binder is encountered (24Kropshofer H. Arndt S.O. Moldenhauer G. Hämmerling G.J. Vogt A.B.

Stern L.J. Evaluating the role of HLA-DM in MHC class II-peptide association reactions.J. Immunol. 2015; 195 (26062997): 706-71610.4049/jimmunol.1403190Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Further results have provided evidence that DM's enzymatic activity is related to the intrinsic stability of the pMHCII, such that less stable complexes are selectively edited (8Weber D.A. Evavold B.D. Jensen P.E. Enhanced dissociation of HLA-DR-bound peptides in the presence of HLA-DM.Science. 1996; 274 (8849454): 618-62010.1126/science.274.5287.618Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 9Vogt A.B.

These studies support the idea that HLA-DM preferentially dissociates peptides from kinetically unstable pMHCII complexes and forms a peptide vacant DM-MHCII intermediate that resolves upon binding a high-affinity peptide, thereby selecting the most intrinsically stable pMHCII complexes for presentation. This hypothesis has been challenged by studies demonstrating examples of DM editing of stable pMHCII complexes, suggesting the presence of unidentified factors in the susceptibility of pMHCII complexes to the enzymatic activity of HLA-DM (11Zhou Z.

The structures showed that HLA-DM does not obstruct the peptide-binding cleft and confirmed that the binding interface consists mainly of interactions between residues in the DRα1 and DMα1 domains. Moreover, the structures revealed significant conformational alterations to the MHCII in a region proximal to the peptide N terminus. This landmark study proposed the prevailing model of DM-mediated peptide exchange, whereby binding of HLA-DM to a pMHCII requires the partial dissociation of peptide from the MHCII-binding cleft (34Schulze M.S.

This model predicates that dissociation of the peptide N terminus is the key determinant of HLA-DM susceptibility. Other studies, however, have suggested that DM susceptibility may not be entirely determined by disruptions at the peptide's N terminus. Rather, DM susceptibility may be governed by the global conformational state of the pMHCII (20Yin L. Trenh P. Guce A. Wieczorek M. Lange S. Sticht J. Jiang W. Bylsma M. Mellins E.D. Freund C.

In the current study, we find that DM-mediated peptide dissociation rates are saturable. This observation allowed us to investigate pMHCII susceptibility to HLA-DM editing by resolving the independent kinetic parameters in the enzymatic activity of DM-mediated peptide exchange reactions. We developed a fluorescence anisotropy assay that measured the real-time dissociation of peptides from MHCII molecules and derived a Michaelis-Menten kinetic model that equates the peptide's observed dissociation rate (kobs) with pMHCII intrinsic stability (kin), DM binding affinity (Km), and catalytic turnover (kcat). Analyzing multiple pMHCII complexes, we find that the intrinsic stability of a pMHCII is linearly correlated with DM catalytic turnover and nonlinearly correlated with DM-binding affinity. We evaluated the impact of prominent pMHCII structural and chemical features on the catalytic mechanism and discovered that interactions throughout the peptide-binding cleft contribute to the bindin"
https://openalex.org/W3002884371,"Among the earliest deuterostomes, the echinoderms are an evolutionary important group of ancient marine animals. Within this phylum, the holothuroids (sea cucumbers) are known to produce a wide range of glycoconjugate biopolymers with apparent benefits to health; therefore, they are of economic and culinary interest throughout the world. Other than their highly modified glycosaminoglycans (e.g. fucosylated chondroitin sulfate and fucoidan), nothing is known about their protein-linked glycosylation. Here we used multistep N-glycan fractionation to efficiently separate anionic and neutral N-glycans before analyzing the N-glycans of the black sea cucumber (Holothuria atra) by MS in combination with enzymatic and chemical treatments. These analyses showed the presence of various fucosylated, phosphorylated, sialylated, and multiply sulfated moieties as modifications of oligomannosidic, hybrid, and complex-type N-glycans. The high degree of sulfation and fucosylation parallels the modifications observed previously on holothuroid glycosaminoglycans. Compatible with its phylogenetic position, H. atra not only expresses vertebrate motifs such as sulfo- and sialyl-Lewis A epitopes but displays a high degree of anionic substitution of its glycans, as observed in other marine invertebrates. Thus, as for other echinoderms, the phylum- and order-specific aspects of this species' N-glycosylation reveal both invertebrate- and vertebrate-like features."
https://openalex.org/W3000926649,"Prednisolone is involved in glucose homeostasis and has been used for treatment for aristolochic acid (AA) nephropathy (AAN), but its effect on glycolysis in kidney has not yet been clarified. This study aims to investigate the effect in terms of altered proteins after prednisolone treatment in a mice model of AAN using a proteomics technique. The six-week C3H/He female mice were administrated AA (0.5 mg/kg/day) for 56 days. AA+P group mice were then given prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) via oral gavage for the next 14 days, and AA group mice were fed water instead. The tubulointerstitial damage was improved after prednisolone treatment comparing to that of AA group. Kidney homogenates were harvested to perform the proteomics analysis with fluorogenic derivatization-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method (FD-LC-MS/MS). On the other hand, urinary methylglyoxal and D-lactate levels were determined by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. There were 47 altered peaks and 39 corresponding proteins on day 14 among the groups, and the glycolysis-related proteins, especially glyoxalase 1 (GLO1), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B (aldolase B), and triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), decreased in the AA+P group. Meanwhile, prednisolone decreased the urinary amount of methylglyoxal (AA+P: 2.004 ± 0.301 μg vs. AA: 2.741 ± 0.630 μg, p < 0.05), which was accompanied with decrease in urinary amount of D-lactate (AA+P: 54.07 ± 5.45 μmol vs. AA: 86.09 ± 8.44 μmol, p < 0.05). Prednisolone thus alleviated inflammation and interstitial renal fibrosis. The renal protective mechanism might be associated with down-regulation of GLO1 via reducing the contents of methylglyoxal derived from glycolysis. With the aid of proteomics analysis and the determination of methylglyoxal and its metabolite-D-lactate, we have demonstrated for the first time the biochemical efficacy of prednisolone, and urinary methylglyoxal and its metabolite-D-lactate might be potential biomarkers for AAN."

This study aimed to investigate the cumulative effectiveness of PPR interventions on the accuracy of beach volleyball serves. Fifty-four beach volleyball players were randomly assigned to one of three PPR intervention groups or a control group. Participants performed 10 serves at a target on the opposite side of the beach volleyball court (pretest), were educated on a PPR intervention, and then completed 10 serves at the target under pressure that was induced through videotaping and ego-relevant instructions (posttest). The results indicated no difference in post-test serving accuracy among the intervention groups and the wait-list control group and no difference in effectiveness between cumulative and isolated PPR use. A possible explanation may be the inefficiency of the pressure manipulation. However, the null results related to isolated and cumulative PPR use under general (i.e., no pressure) conditions are still an important research finding. Future research should investigate the effectiveness of cumulative and other PPRs in other sports in general and under pressure."

This study investigated biofilm spatiotemporal patterns and responses to concurrent and antecedent (i.e., preceding biofilm sampling) environmental conditions at stream sites upstream and downstream from Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during two deicing seasons (2009–2010; 2010–2011). Biofilm abundance and community composition were investigated along spatial and temporal gradients using field surveys and microarray analyses, respectively. Given the recognized role of Sphaerotilus in organically enriched environments, additional analyses were pursued to specifically characterize its abundance: a consensus sthA sequence was determined via comparison of whole metagenome sequences with a previously identified sthA sequence, the primers developed for this gene were used to characterize relative Sphaerotilus abundance using quantitative real-time PCR, and a Sphaerotilus strain was isolated to validate the determined sthA sequence. Results indicated that biofilm abundance was stimulated by elevated antecedent chemical oxygen demand concentrations, a surrogate for deicer concentrations, with minimal biofilm volumes observed when antecedent chemical oxygen demand concentrations remained below 48 mg/L. Biofilms were composed of diverse communities (including sheathed bacterium Thiothrix) whose composition appeared to shift in relation to antecedent temperature and chemical oxygen demand. The relative abundance of sthA correlated most strongly with heterotrophic biofilm volume (positive) and dissolved oxygen (negative), indicating that Sphaerotilus was likely a consistent biofilm member and thrived under low oxygen conditions. Additional investigations identified the isolate as a new strain of Sphaerotilus montanus (strain KMKE) able to use deicer components as carbon sources and found that stream dissolved oxygen concentrations related inversely to biofilm volume as well as to antecedent temperature and chemical oxygen demand. The airport setting provides insight into potential consequences of widescale adoption of organic deicers for roadway deicing."
https://openalex.org/W3002417260,"There is limited information that provides a comprehensive understanding of the trophic ecology of Mexican Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardii) colonies. While scat analysis has been used to determine the diet of some colonies, the integrative characterization of its feeding habits on broader temporal and spatial scales remains limited. We examined potential feeding grounds, trophic niche width, and overlap, and inferred the degree of dietary specialization using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (δ13C and δ15N) in this subspecies. We analyzed δ13C and δ15N on fur samples from pups collected at five sites along the western coast of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. Fur of natal coat of Pacific harbor seal pups begins to grow during the seventh month in utero until the last stage of gestation. Therefore pup fur is a good proxy for the mother's feeding habits in winter (~December to March), based on the timing of gestation for the subspecies in this region. Our results indicated that the δ13C and δ15N values differed significantly among sampling sites, with the highest mean δ15N value occurring at the southernmost site, reflecting a well-characterized north to south latitudinal 15N-enrichment in the food web. The tendency identified in δ13C values, in which the northern colonies showed the most enriched values, suggests nearshore and benthic-demersal feeding habits. A low variance in δ13C and δ15N values for each colony (<1‰) and relatively small standard ellipse areas suggest a specialized foraging behavior in adult female Pacific harbor seals in Mexican waters."
https://openalex.org/W3002847871,"The environmental hypoxia of high altitude (HA) increases the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) approximately threefold. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ), a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that promotes vasorelaxation by increasing nitric oxide and downregulating endothelin-1 (ET-1) production, has been implicated in IUGR. Based on our prior work indicating that pharmacologic activation of the PPARγ pathway protects against hypoxia-associated IUGR, we used an experimental murine model to determine whether such effects may be attributed to vasodilatory effects in the uteroplacental circulation. Using wire myography, ex vivo vasoreactivity studies were conducted in uterine arteries (UtA) isolated from pregnant mice exposed to hypoxia or normoxia from gestational day 14.5 to 18.5. Exposure to troglitazone, a high-affinity PPARγ agonist-induced vasorelaxation in UtA preconstricted with phenylephrine, with HA-UtA showing increased sensitivity. Troglitazone blunted ET-1-induced contraction of UtA in hypoxic and normoxic dams equivalently. Immunohistological analysis revealed enhanced staining for ET-1 receptors in the placental labyrinthine zone in hypoxic compared to normoxic dams. Our results suggest that pharmacologic PPAR-γ activation, via its vasoactive properties, may protect the fetal growth under hypoxic conditions by improving uteroplacental perfusion and thereby justify further investigation into PPARγ as a therapeutic target for IUGR in pregnancies complicated by hypoxia."

Together, these elements establish a “phosphatase-resistant cage conformation” of the catalytic cleft that is shared among AGC kinases. In addition, we demonstrated previously that a molecular motif outside of the core domain of Akt allosterically contributes to phosphatase resistance of its activation loop residue (13Chan T.O.

Based on these earlier findings, we hypothesized that sequences outside of the catalytic cleft and unique to PKA may also contribute to allosteric control of the phosphatase-resistant cage conformation of this AGC kinase. Here we describe, for the first time, three molecular motifs located in the PKAc N and C termini that cooperatively stabilize the activation loop conformation and restrict phosphatase access to Thr197. This conformation is critical for PKAc stability, expression, and function and contributes to the unique phosphorylation-resistant nature of PKA. PKA and Akt kinases are members of the AGC kinase family and share threonine residues in the activation loop (Thr308 in Akt1 and Thr197 in PKAc) that need to be phosphorylated for activity. In the absence of protective elements (membrane binding and C-terminal pocket and ATP pocket occupation), the prephosphorylated Akt activation loop is exquisitely sensitive to dephosphorylation. In contrast, the prephosphorylated PKAc activation loop constitutively resists dephosphorylation under cell-free native and quiescent cell culture conditions (6Bechtel P.J. Beavo J.A. Krebs E.G.

We validated different rates of Akt and PKAc dephosphorylation under consistent cell-free assay conditions by incubating 50 ng of recombinant PKAc phosphorylated at Thr197 and 50 ng of recombinant Akt phosphorylated at Thr308 with recombinant phosphatases. We used Escherichia coli-derived λ-phosphatase protein phosphatase (Fig. 1A), which could release phosphate groups from phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, and also the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) catalytic subunit (Fig. S2). PP2A is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotes and releases phosphorylated serine/threonine residues with a broad substrate specificity. Consistent with our earlier observations (13Chan T.O. Zhang J. Tiegs B.C. Blumhof B. Yan L. Keny N. Penny M. Li X. Pascal J.M. Armen R.S. Rodeck U. Penn R.B.

In contrast, less than 2% of PKAc Thr197 was dephosphorylated within this time frame. Thus, consistent with earlier reports, the purified PKA catalytic subunit is highly phosphatase-resistant compared with Akt. The catalytic domains of PKA and Akt share a high degree of structural and amino acid homology. Sequences outside of their protein kinase cores diverge significantly (PKA, PDB code 4DG0; Akt2, PDB code 1O6K; Fig. 1B). Based on molecular and thermal stability calculations, we hypothesized that N-terminal and C-terminal sequences unique to PKA underpin the resistance of pThr197 to phosphatase attack by restraining the flexibility of the catalytic cleft conformation.

Biol. 1999; 71 (10354702): 313-34110.1016/S0079-6107(98)00059-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The corresponding amino acid sequences in Akt kinase are unstructured (16Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Crystal structure of an activated Akt/protein kinase B ternary complex with GSK3-peptide and AMP-PNP.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9 (12434148): 940-94410.1038/nsb870Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Similarly, a PKAc C-terminal FXXF motif (347FXXF350) has been found previously to enhance thermal stability and enzymatic catalysis (17Batkin M. Schvartz I. Shaltiel S. Snapping of the carboxyl terminal tail of the catalytic subunit of PKA onto its core: characterization of the sites by mutagenesis.Biochemistry. 2000; 39 (10820007): 5366-537310.1021/bi000153zCrossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our earlier Chemistry at HARvard Macromolecular Mechanics molecular simulation program-based analysis of the PKAc structure showed that the FXXF motif contained in the C terminus is well-ordered and is predicted to form “high-contact-order” interactions in the kinase domain to stabilize the tertiary structures (18Fersht A.R. Transition-state structure as a unifying basis in protein-folding mechanisms: contact order, chain topology, stability, and the extended nucleus mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97 (10677494): 1525-152910.1073/pnas.97.4.1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In contrast, the AKT kinase structure shows that the Akt C-terminal sequences around the FXXF motif are disordered and that the AKT FXXF motif interacts with the kinase domain in a more labile and dynamic fashion. The AKT kinase C terminus FXXF motif binds the kinase domain with weak affinity (3600 μm) (19Yang J. Cron P. Thompson V. Good V.M. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Molecular mechanism for the regulation of protein kinase B/Akt by hydrophobic motif phosphorylation.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9 (12086620): 1227-124010.1016/S1097-2765(02)00550-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). However, replacing the AKT C terminus FXXF motif with a high-affinity peptide (PIFtide, 6 μm) markedly increased protection of the AKT activation loop from dephosphorylation (13Chan T.O. Zhang J. Tiegs B.C. Blumhof B. Yan L. Keny N. Penny M. Li X. Pascal J.M. Armen R.S. Rodeck U. Penn R.B. Akt kinase C-terminal modifications control activation loop dephosphorylation and enhance insulin response.Biochem. J. 2015; 471 (26201515): 37-5110.1042/BJ20150325Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), suggesting that the strength of the intramolecular interactions of the PKAc FXXF motif with the kinase domain may also regulate phosphatase protection of the activation loop. Based on these considerations, we decided to assess the relative contribution of N- and C-terminal sequences of the catalytic subunit of PKA to phosphatase sensitivity and resistance. Our previous work with myristoylated Akt revealed that mutating the FXXF motif effectively reduced Akt phosphorylation by over 90% (Fig. S3) (10Chan T.O. Zhang J. Rodeck U. Pascal J.M. Armen R.S. Spring M. Dumitru C.D. Myers V. Li X. Cheung J.Y. Feldman A.M. Resistance of Akt kinases to dephosphorylation through ATP-dependent conformational plasticity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

J. 2015; 471 (26201515): 37-5110.1042/BJ20150325Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To test whether phosphorylation of myristoylated PKA was similarly affected by its FXXF motif, we abolished, by site-directed mutagenesis, the myristoylation site (G1A) of human PKA catalytic subunit α and its FXXF motif (F347A/F350A) (Fig. 2A). Mutating the myristoylation signal (G1A) or the FXXF motif (F347A/F350A) only minimally affected PKA Thr197 phosphorylation in HEK293 cells and in primary human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells (Fig. 2, B and C). The quantitative ProteinSimple Wes digital Western system (see “Experimental procedures”) determined that abolishing myristoylation (G1A) or disabling the FXXF motif (F347A/F350A) separately reduced steady-state Thr197 phosphorylation by 23% ± 18% and 25% ± 12%, respectively. Targeting both sites in the same construct was associated with a 75% ± 6% (p < 0.05 relative to G1A and FXXF mutations; Fig. 2, C and D, and Fig. S4, A and B) decrease in Thr197 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation status of these mutants was not affected by costimulation of cells with 10 μm forskolin (Fig. 2C and Fig. S5), suggesting that this effect is innate to the PKA catalytic domain and not affected by forskolin-induced cAMP binding of the PKA regulatory subunit. Overexpression of PKAc-3×HA-WT and changes in PKAc-3×HA mutant phosphorylation states did not significantly affect phosphorylation or expression of endogenous PKA (Fig. S4, C and D). In summary, these data demonstrate that “constitutive” PKAc activation loop phosphorylation can be markedly reduced by simultaneously abolishing N-terminal myristoylation and disabling the C-terminal FXXF motif. The N-terminal structure of the PKA catalytic subunit shows that the myristoylation sequence (residues 1–10) and the α-helix (residues 11–34) stably pack against the kinase domain (Fig. 3A, reviewed in Ref. 15Smith C.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Madhusudan Akamine P. Taylor S.S. The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase: prototype for an extended network of communication.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71 (10354702): 313-34110.1016/S0079-6107(98)00059-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). By mutational analysis, we determined that, even when the myristoylation signal was preserved, partial deletion of the α-helix (Δ24–34) resulted in reduced PKAc activation loop phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Further alanine scanning and mutational analysis determined that only Phe26 and Trp30 (subsequently termed the FXXW motif) are required for protection of the activation loop against dephosphorylation (Fig. 3B). These data are consistent with previous work by Taylor and co-workers (20Veron M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Tsigelny I. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. A conserved helix motif complements the protein kinase core.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Dissection of the nucleotide and metal-phosphate binding sites in cAMP-dependent protein kinase.Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (10320366): 6352-636010.1021/bi982672wCrossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) demonstrating that Phe26 and Trp30 occupy a deep hydrophobic pocket within the kinase core and that mutating Trp30 increases PKA instability. To ascertain the relative contribution of the FXXW motif to activation loop phosphorylation, we disabled the amino acid terminal FXXW motif (F26A/W30A) and the C-terminal FXXF motif (F347A/F350A) alone or in combination. Upon transfection into HASM cells, we observed that, even in the presence of myristoylation sequences, the combined mutations FXXW and FXXF reduced Thr197 phosphorylation in a cooperative manner. Combined mutations reduced phosphorylation to 68% ± 7% (p < 0.05) compared with 21% ± 18% reduction in the FXXW mutation and 25% ± 12% reduction in the FXXF mutation (Fig. 3C and Figs. S4, A and B, and S6). Quantification of the data, summarized in Fig. S4B, showed the effects of mutating all combinations of the three molecular motifs under investigation. Mutating both G1A/FXXF more than additively decreased pThr197 phosphorylation compared with mutating each motif alone (Fig. 2D). Mutating FXXW/FXXF motifs also more than additively decreased phosphorylation compared with mutating each motif alone (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, mutating both sites at the N terminus (G1A and FXXW) did not further decrease pThr197 phosphorylation (G1A/FXXW, 29% ± 26%; G1A, 23% ± 18%; FXXW, 21% ± 18%; Fig. S4, B and C). Collectively, these results suggest that intramolecular interactions of two N-terminal nodes (myristoylation signal and the FXXW motif) and a C-terminal FXXF motif cooperated to protect the PKAc activation loop against dephosphorylation in a superadditive manner. Decreased phosphorylation in cells could be due to reduced phosphorylation, increased dephosphorylation, or a combination of both. To distinguish effects of PKA mutations on PKAc phosphorylation versus PKAc dephosphorylation, we took advantage of the prior observation that PDK1 phosphorylates the activation loop of many AGC kinases, including PKAc (22Mora A. Komander D. van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. PDK1, the master regulator of AGC kinase signal transduction.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15 (15209375): 161-17010.1016/j.semcdb.2003.12.022Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Specifically we cotransfected PKAc WT or a phosphorylation-defective PKAc construct (F26A/W30A/F347A/F350A) with a construct encoding PDK1. In the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate, these constructs were efficiently phosphorylated in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4A). Flash-frozen cell extracts prepared from maximally phosphorylated WT and F26A/W30A/F347A/F350A mutant allowed us to monitor time-dependent dephosphorylation of PKAc variants independent of concurrent changes in phosphorylation. Time-dependent dephosphorylation was assessed in EDTA detergent cell-free extracts as described recently (13Chan T.O. Zhang J. Tiegs B.C. Blumhof B. Yan L. Keny N. Penny M. Li X. Pascal J.M. Armen R.S. Rodeck U. Penn R.B. Akt kinase C-terminal modifications control activation loop dephosphorylation and enhance insulin response.Biochem. J. 2015; 471 (26201515): 37-5110.1042/BJ20150325Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). As expected, PKAc WT was only marginally dephosphorylated (6% ± 4%) after 30 min of incubation at 30 °C (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the PKAc-F26A/W30A/F347A/F350A mutant was dephosphorylated by 52% ± 6% (p < 0.01 compared with WT PKAc) under the same experimental conditions. Because transfected PKAc mutant proteins often expressed at a lower level, we developed an immunoprecipitation-based phosphatase assay where equal amounts of PKAc WT and mutant proteins were used. To prepare the immunoprecipitates, we transfected two phosphorylation-defective PKAc constructs, G1A/F347A/F350A and G1A/F26A/W30A/F347A/F350A, into HASM or HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A and Fig. S4E, PKAc mutant constructs were efficiently phosphorylated at pThr197 in cells by PDK1 cotransfection and phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate treatment. We immunoprecipitated equal amounts of PKAc WT and PKAc mutants from the cell extracts. Incubating the immunoprecipitates in a buffer containing recombinant phosphatase showed that PKAc mutants were dephosphorylated faster than WT-PKAc (G1A/F347A/F350A, 84% ± 4%; G1A/F26A/W30A/F347A/F350A, 74% ± 8%; PKAc WT, 41% ± 9%, p < 0.05; Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results indicate that the mutations affecting the FXXF and FXXW motifs do not interfere with the ability of PKAc to be phosphorylated and that the combined mutations affect PKAc dephosphorylation resistance independent of effects on phosphorylation per se. We next tested the effects of modifying PKAc dephosphorylation resistance on PKA function in cells. PKA activation by cAMP is known to regulate HASM cell contraction/relaxation/motility (2Billington C.K. Ojo O.O. Penn R.B. Ito S. cAMP regulation of airway smooth muscle function.Pulm. Pharmacol. Ther. 2013; 26 (22634112): 112-12010.1016/j.pupt.2012.05.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Transient overexpression of the WT PKAc construct in HASM cells resulted in a rounded cell morphology (normally HASM cells are elongated in morphology) within 24 h, whereas overexpressing the catalytically inactive PKAc-T197A mutant did not affect cell morphology in either HASM or HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A and Fig. S7A). Cells expressing either G1A or F347A/F350A PKAc still had the rounded HASM cell morphology. However, cells expressing mutant constructs (G1A/F347A/F350A) did not undergo morphological transition (Fig. 5B), consistent with PKAc loss of function. Similarly, G1A/F26A/W30A/F347A/F350A mutant- or F26A/W30A/F347A/F350A-transfected cells did not undergo morphological transition (data not shown). Next we tested the effect of PKA construct expression in HASM cell adhesion and spreading by use of the xCELLigence (ACEA Biosciences) system, which allows noninvasive electric cell substrate impedance measurements. Impaired cell spreading manifests as reduced impedance of confluent cell layers in this assay. Six hours after transfection, equal numbers of cells were placed into electronic microtiter plates. Starting 2 h after plating, PKAc WT–expressing cells had reduced impedance values compared with the G1A/F347A/F350A mutant and vector control, consistent with faster adhesion and spreading in the absence of PKA activity (Fig. 5C). Finally, PKA is known to inhibit migration of HASM cells (23Goncharova E.A. Goncharov D.A. Zhao H. Penn R.B. Krymskaya V.P. Panettieri Jr., R.A. β2-adrenergic receptor agonists modulate human airway smooth muscle cell migration via vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2012; 46 (22210825): 48-5410.1165/rcmb.2011-0217OCCrossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of PKAc variants with differential phosphatase sensitivity on HASM cell migration by tracking cell migration into the 500-μm space created by a silicone insert (Ibidi GmbH). Transfected mutant–expressing cells were tracked by cotransfected GFP plasmid. PKAc WT–expressing cells failed to migrate into the gap space after 72 h, whereas cells expressing the PKAc G1A/F347A/F350F mutant migrated into the gap space, similar to vector control–transfected cells (Fig. 5D and Fig. S7B). These results suggest that the cooperative preservation of PKA Thr197 phosphorylation between the PKAc myristoylation signal, the N-terminal FXXW motif, and the C-terminal FXXF motif is vital for PKA function. Maintaining phosphorylation of the centrally located activation loop is critical for the catalytic activities of most AGC kinases (4Huse M. Kuriyan J. The conformational plasticity of protein kinases.Cell. 2002; 109 (12015977): 275-28210.1016/S0092-8674(02)00741-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 5Pearce L.R.

Compared with other AGC kinases, the PKA activation loop resists dephosphorylation in both cell-free and cell-based assay formats more effectively (6Bechtel P.J. Beavo J.A. Krebs E.G.
