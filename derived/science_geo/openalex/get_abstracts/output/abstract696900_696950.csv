https://openalex.org/W4285387237,"Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), the clonal expansion of a blood stem cell and its progeny driven by somatic driver mutations, affects over a third of people, yet remains poorly understood. Here we analyze genetic data from 200,453 UK Biobank participants to map the landscape of inherited predisposition to CH, increasing the number of germline associations with CH in European-ancestry populations from 4 to 14. Genes at new loci implicate DNA damage repair (PARP1, ATM, CHEK2), hematopoietic stem cell migration/homing (CD164) and myeloid oncogenesis (SETBP1). Several associations were CH-subtype-specific including variants at TCL1A and CD164 that had opposite associations with DNMT3A- versus TET2-mutant CH, the two most common CH subtypes, proposing key roles for these two loci in CH development. Mendelian randomization analyses showed that smoking and longer leukocyte telomere length are causal risk factors for CH and that genetic predisposition to CH increases risks of myeloproliferative neoplasia, nonhematological malignancies, atrial fibrillation and blood epigenetic ageing."
https://openalex.org/W4285388424,"Current mass spectrometry methods enable high-throughput proteomics of large sample amounts, but proteomics of low sample amounts remains limited in depth and throughput. To increase the throughput of sensitive proteomics, we developed an experimental and computational framework, called plexDIA, for simultaneously multiplexing the analysis of peptides and samples. Multiplexed analysis with plexDIA increases throughput multiplicatively with the number of labels without reducing proteome coverage or quantitative accuracy. By using three-plex non-isobaric mass tags, plexDIA enables quantification of threefold more protein ratios among nanogram-level samples. Using 1-hour active gradients, plexDIA quantified ~8,000 proteins in each sample of labeled three-plex sets and increased data completeness, reducing missing data more than twofold across samples. Applied to single human cells, plexDIA quantified ~1,000 proteins per cell and achieved 98% data completeness within a plexDIA set while using ~5 minutes of active chromatography per cell. These results establish a general framework for increasing the throughput of sensitive and quantitative protein analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4285391095,"The chr12q24.13 locus encoding OAS1-OAS3 antiviral proteins has been associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility. Here, we report genetic, functional and clinical insights into this locus in relation to COVID-19 severity. In our analysis of patients of European (n = 2,249) and African (n = 835) ancestries with hospitalized versus nonhospitalized COVID-19, the risk of hospitalized disease was associated with a common OAS1 haplotype, which was also associated with reduced severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) clearance in a clinical trial with pegIFN-λ1. Bioinformatic analyses and in vitro studies reveal the functional contribution of two associated OAS1 exonic variants comprising the risk haplotype. Derived human-specific alleles rs10774671-A and rs1131454 -A decrease OAS1 protein abundance through allele-specific regulation of splicing and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). We conclude that decreased OAS1 expression due to a common haplotype contributes to COVID-19 severity. Our results provide insight into molecular mechanisms through which early treatment with interferons could accelerate SARS-CoV-2 clearance and mitigate against severe COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4285388619,"Epigenetic remodeling is essential for oncogene-induced cellular transformation and malignancy. In contrast to histone post-translational modifications, how DNA methylation is remodeled by oncogenic signaling remains poorly understood. The oncoprotein YAP, a coactivator of the TEAD transcription factors mediating Hippo signaling, is widely activated in human cancers. Here, we identify the 5-methylcytosine dioxygenase TET1 as a direct YAP target and a master regulator that coordinates the genome-wide epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming of YAP target genes in the liver. YAP activation induces the expression of TET1, which physically interacts with TEAD to cause regional DNA demethylation, histone H3K27 acetylation and chromatin opening in YAP target genes to facilitate transcriptional activation. Loss of TET1 not only reverses YAP-induced epigenetic and transcriptional changes but also suppresses YAP-induced hepatomegaly and tumorigenesis. These findings exemplify how oncogenic signaling regulates the site specificity of DNA demethylation to promote tumorigenesis and implicate TET1 as a potential target for modulating YAP signaling in physiology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4285586219,"CYP11A1 and CYP27A1 hydroxylate tachysterol3, a photoproduct of previtamin D3, producing 20S-hydroxytachysterol3 [20S(OH)T3] and 25(OH)T3, respectively. Both metabolites were detected in the human epidermis and serum. Tachysterol3 was also detected in human serum at a concentration of 7.3 ± 2.5 ng/ml. 20S(OH)T3 and 25(OH)T3 inhibited the proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts and stimulated the expression of differentiation and anti-oxidative genes in keratinocytes in a similar manner to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]. They acted on the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as demonstrated by image flow cytometry and the translocation of VDR coupled GFP from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of melanoma cells, as well as by the stimulation of CYP24A1 expression. Functional studies using a human aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) reporter assay system revealed marked activation of AhR by 20S(OH)T3, a smaller effect by 25(OH)T3, and a minimal effect for their precursor, tachysterol3. Tachysterol3 hydroxyderivatives showed high-affinity binding to the ligan-binding domain (LBD) of the liver X receptor (LXR) α and β, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in LanthaScreen TR-FRET coactivator assays. Molecular docking using crystal structures of the LBDs of VDR, AhR, LXRs, and PPARγ revealed high docking scores for 20S(OH)T3 and 25(OH)T3, comparable to their natural ligands. The scores for the non-genomic-binding site of the VDR were very low indicating a lack of interaction with tachysterol3 ligands. Our identification of endogenous production of 20S(OH)T3 and 25(OH)T3 that are biologically active and interact with VDR, AhR, LXRs, and PPARγ, provides a new understanding of the biological function of tachysterol3."
https://openalex.org/W4285386073,"Increasingly, it is possible to design peptide and protein assemblies de novo from first principles or computationally. This approach provides new routes to functional synthetic polypeptides, including designs to target and bind proteins of interest. Much of this work has been developed in vitro. Therefore, a challenge is to deliver de novo polypeptides efficiently to sites of action within cells. Here we describe the design, characterisation, intracellular delivery, and subcellular localisation of a de novo synthetic peptide system. This system comprises a dual-function basic peptide, programmed both for cell penetration and target binding, and a complementary acidic peptide that can be fused to proteins of interest and introduced into cells using synthetic DNA. The designs are characterised in vitro using biophysical methods and X-ray crystallography. The utility of the system for delivery into mammalian cells and subcellular targeting is demonstrated by marking organelles and actively engaging functional protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W4285023950,"Neuropeptides are a chemically diverse class of cell-to-cell signaling molecules that are widely expressed throughout the central nervous system, often in a cell-specific manner. While cell-to-cell differences in neuropeptides is expected, it is often unclear how exactly neuropeptide expression varies among neurons. Here we created a microscopy-guided, high-throughput single cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry approach to investigate the neuropeptide heterogeneity of individual neurons in the central nervous system of the neurobiological model Aplysia californica, the California sea hare. In all, we analyzed more than 26,000 neurons from 18 animals and assigned 866 peptides from 66 prohormones by mass matching against an in silico peptide library generated from known Aplysia prohormones retrieved from the UniProt database. Louvain-Jaccard (LJ) clustering of mass spectra from individual neurons revealed 40 unique neuronal populations, or LJ clusters, each with a distinct neuropeptide profile. Prohormones and their related peptides were generally found in single cells from ganglia consistent with the prohormones' previously known ganglion localizations. Several LJ clusters also revealed the cellular colocalization of behaviorally related prohormones, such as an LJ cluster exhibiting achatin and neuropeptide Y, which are involved in feeding, and another cluster characterized by urotensin II, small cardiac peptide, sensorin A, and FRFa, which have shown activity in the feeding network or are present in the feeding musculature. This mass spectrometry-based approach enables the robust categorization of large cell populations based on single cell neuropeptide content and is readily adaptable to the study of a range of animals and tissue types."
https://openalex.org/W4285385923,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas12a is widely used for genome editing and diagnostics, so it is important to understand how RNA-guided DNA recognition activates the cleavage of the target strand (TS) following non-target-strand (NTS) cleavage. Here we used single-molecule magnetic tweezers, gel-based assays and nanopore sequencing to explore DNA unwinding and cleavage. In addition to dynamic and heterogenous R-loop formation, we also directly observed transient double-stranded DNA unwinding downstream of the 20-bp heteroduplex and, following NTS cleavage, formation of a hyperstable 'clamped' Cas12a-DNA intermediate necessary for TS cleavage. Annealing of a 4-nucleotide 3' CRISPR RNA overhang to the unwound TS downstream of the heteroduplex inhibited clamping and slowed TS cleavage by ~16-fold. Alanine substitution of a conserved aromatic amino acid in the REC2 subdomain that normally caps the R-loop relieved this inhibition but favoured stabilisation of unwound states, suggesting that the REC2 subdomain regulates access of the 3' CRISPR RNA to downstream DNA."
https://openalex.org/W4285387776,"RNA-based macromolecular machines, such as the ribosome, have functional parts reliant on structural interactions spanning sequence-distant regions. These features limit evolutionary exploration of mutant libraries and confound three-dimensional structure-guided design. To address these challenges, we describe Evolink (evolution and linkage), a method that enables high-throughput evolution of sequence-distant regions in large macromolecular machines, and library design guided by computational RNA modeling to enable exploration of structurally stable designs. Using Evolink, we evolved a tethered ribosome with a 58% increased activity in orthogonal protein translation and a 97% improvement in doubling times in SQ171 cells compared to a previously developed tethered ribosome, and reveal new permissible sequences in a pair of ribosomal helices with previously explored biological function. The Evolink approach may enable enhanced engineering of macromolecular machines for new and improved functions for synthetic biology."
https://openalex.org/W4285387861,"The COVID-19 pandemic upended how many Americans acquire foods. In this paper, we analyze eight food acquisition activities at different points in the pandemic, which allows us to evaluate how food acquisition changed as case rates changed and vaccine rollouts occurred. We collected data from three nationally representative online samples in September 2020, December 2020, and March 2021. We evaluate changes across time and across demographics using a multivariate probit model. Across time, we find that in-person grocery shopping remained extremely common (over 90%) throughout the pandemic. Food acquisition activities with less in-person contact (e.g., ordering from a meal kit service, online grocery shopping) peaked in December 2020, likely due to the surge in cases during that period. Ordering take-out from a restaurant remained common throughout the pandemic, but indoor dining increased significantly in March 2021 when vaccines were becoming more widely available. Food acquisition activities also varied across consumer groups, particularly indoor and outdoor restaurant dining. Overall our results offer evidence that in-person grocery shopping is a staple food acquisition activity that is unlikely to be changed; however, there is a segment of consumers who complement their in-person grocery shopping with online grocery shopping options. Further, relative to grocery stores, restaurants may be more vulnerable to surges in COVID-19 case rates. We conclude with implications for grocery retailers and restaurants as they continue to navigate operational challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4285389413,"With a limited arsenal of available antifungal drugs and drug-resistance emergence, strategies that seek to reduce Candida immune evasion and virulence could be a promising alternative option. Harnessing metal homeostasis against C. albicans has gained wide prominence nowadays as a feasible antifungal strategy. Herein, the effect of magnesium (Mg) deprivation on the immune evasion mechanisms of C. albicans is demonstrated. We studied host pathogen interaction by using the THP-1 cell line model and explored the avenue that macrophage-mediated killing was enhanced under Mg deprivation, leading to altered cytokine (TNFα, IL-6 and IL10) production and reduced pyroptosis. Insights into the mechanisms revealed that hyphal damage inside the macrophage was diminished under Mg deprivation. Additionally, Mg deprivation led to cell wall remodelling; leading to enhanced β-1,3-glucan exposure, crucial for immune recognition, along with concomitant alterations in chitin and mannan levels. Furthermore, vacuole homeostasis was disrupted under Mg deprivation, as revealed by abrogated morphology and defective acidification of the vacuole lumen. Together, we demonstrated that Mg deprivation affected immune evasion mechanisms by: reduced hyphal damage, enhanced β-1,3-glucan exposure and altered vacuole functioning. The study establishes that Mg availability is indispensable for successful C. albicans immune evasion and specific Mg dependent pathways could be targeted for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4285021045,"Highly deuterated protein samples expand the biophysics and biological tool kit by providing, among other qualities, contrast matching in neutron diffraction experiments and reduction of dipolar spin interactions from normally protonated proteins in magnetic resonance studies, impacting both electron paramagnetic resonance and NMR spectroscopy. In NMR applications, deuteration is often combined with other isotopic labeling patterns to expand the range of conventional NMR spectroscopy research in both solution and solid-state conditions. However, preparation of deuterated proteins is challenging. We present here a simple, effective, and user-friendly protocol to produce highly deuterated proteins in Escherichia coli cells. The protocol utilizes the common shaker flask growth method and the well-known pET system (which provides expression control via the T7 promotor) for large-scale recombinant protein expression. One liter expression typically yields 5 to 50 mg of highly deuterated protein. Our data demonstrate that the optimized procedure produces a comparable quantity of protein in deuterium (2H2O) oxide M9 medium compared with that in 1H2O M9 medium. The protocol will enable a broader utilization of deuterated proteins in a number of biophysical techniques."

https://openalex.org/W4285389671,"Obligate symbiotic bacteria associated with the insects feeding exclusively on vertebrate blood are supposed to complement B vitamins presumably lacking in their diet. Recent genomic analyses revealed considerable differences in biosynthetic capacities across different symbionts, suggesting that levels of B vitamins may vary across different vertebrate hosts. However, a rigorous determination of B vitamins content in blood of various vertebrates has not yet been approached. A reliable analytical method focused on B vitamin complex in blood can provide valuable informative background and understanding of general principles of insect symbiosis. In this work, a chromatographic separation of eight B vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, biotin, folic acid, and cyanocobalamine), four B vitamin derivatives (niacinamide, pyridoxal-5-phosphate, 4-pyridoxic acid, and tetrahydrofolic acid), and 3 stable isotope labelled internal standards was developed. Detection was carried out using dual-pressure linear ion trap mass spectrometer in FullScan MS/MS and SIM mode. Except for vitamin B9 (tetrahydrofolic acid), the instrument quantitation limits of all analytes were ranging from 0.42 to 5.0 μg/L, correlation coefficients from 0.9997 to 1.0000, and QC coefficients from 0.53 to 3.2%. Optimization of whole blood sample preparation step was focused especially on evaluation of two types of protein-precipitation agents: trichloroacetic acid and zinc sulphate in methanol. The best results were obtained for zinc sulphate in methanol, but only nine analytes were successfully validated. Accuracy of the procedure using this protein-precipitating agent was ranging from 89 to 120%, precision from 0.5 to 13%, and process efficiency from 65 to 108%. The content of B vitamins in whole blood samples from human and various vertebrates is presented as an application example of this newly developed method."
https://openalex.org/W4285491193,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an important component of energy expenditure and necessary to maintain body temperature for newborn mammals. In the previous study, we found that L-carnitine was enriched in BAT and promoted BAT adipogenesis and thermogenesis in goat brown adipocytes. However, whether dietary L-carnitine regulates BAT heat production and energy expenditure in lambs remains unclear. In this study, maternal L-carnitine supplementation elevated the rectal temperature, as well as the expression of UCP1 and mitochondrial DNA content to promote BAT thermogenesis in newborn goats. Moreover, maternal L-carnitine supplementation increased the levels of triglycerides (TG), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and lactate in plasma, as well as the content of lipid droplet and glycogen in BAT of newborn goats. Lipidomic analysis showed that maternal L-carnitine supplementation remodeled the lipid composition of BAT in newborn goats. L-carnitine significantly increased the levels of TG and diglyceride (DG) and decreased the levels of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids in BAT. Further studies showed that L-carnitine promoted TG and glycogen deposition in brown adipocytes through AMPKα. Our results indicate that maternal L-carnitine supplementation promotes BAT development and thermogenesis in newborn goats and provides new evidence for newborn goats to maintain body temperature in response to cold exposure."
https://openalex.org/W4285008330,"Proximal tubular epithelial cells respond to transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) to synthesize collagen I (α2) during renal fibrosis. The oncoprotein DJ-1 has previously been shown to promote tumorigenesis and prevent apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons; however, its role in fibrosis signaling is unclear. Here, we show TGFβ-stimulation increased expression of DJ-1, which promoted noncanonical mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities. We show DJ-1 augmented the phosphorylation/activation of PKCβII, a direct substrate of mTORC2. In addition, coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed association of DJ-1 with Raptor and Rictor, exclusive subunits of mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively, as well as with mTOR kinase. Interestingly, siRNAs against DJ-1 blocked TGFβ-stimulated expression of collagen I (α2), while expression of DJ-1 increased expression of this protein. In addition, expression of dominant negative PKCβII and siRNAs against PKCβII significantly inhibited TGFβ-induced collagen I (α2) expression. In fact, constitutively active PKCβII abrogated the effect of siRNAs against DJ-1, suggesting a role of PKCβII downstream of this oncoprotein. Moreover, we demonstrate expression of collagen I (α2) stimulated by DJ-1 and its target PKCβII is dependent on the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif1α). Finally, we show in the renal cortex of diabetic rats that increased TGFβ was associated with enhanced expression of DJ-1 and activation of mTOR and PKCβII, concomitant with increased Hif1α and collagen I (α2). Overall, we identified that DJ-1 affects TGFβ-induced expression of collagen I (α2) via an mTOR-, PKCβII-, and Hif1α-dependent mechanism to regulate renal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4285006034,"Rubella, a viral disease characterized by a red skin rash, is well controlled because of an effective vaccine, but outbreaks are still occurring in the absence of available antiviral treatments. The Rubella virus (RUBV) papain-like protease (RubPro) is crucial for RUBV replication, cleaving the nonstructural polyprotein p200 into two multifunctional proteins, p150 and p90. This protease could represent a potential drug target, but structural and mechanistic details important for the inhibition of this enzyme are unclear. Here, we report a novel crystal structure of RubPro at a resolution of 1.64 Å. The RubPro adopts a unique papain-like protease fold, with a similar catalytic core to that of proteases from Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and foot-and-mouth disease virus while having a distinctive N-terminal fingers domain. RubPro has well-conserved sequence motifs that are also found in its newly discovered Rubivirus relatives. In addition, we show that the RubPro construct has protease activity in trans against a construct of RUBV protease-helicase and fluorogenic peptides. A protease-helicase construct, exogenously expressed in Escherichia coli, was also cleaved at the p150-p90 cleavage junction, demonstrating protease activity of the protease-helicase protein. We also demonstrate that RubPro possesses deubiquitylation activity, suggesting a potential role of RubPro in modulating the host's innate immune responses. We anticipate that these structural and functional insights of RubPro will advance our current understanding of its function and help facilitate more structure-based research into the RUBV replication machinery, in hopes of developing antiviral therapeutics against RUBV."
https://openalex.org/W4285386350,"Background Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are increasing in Saudi Arabia (SA). Among other conditions, these risk factors increase the likelihood of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which in turn increases risks for advanced liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and cancer. The goal of this study was to quantify the health and economic burden of obesity-attributable T2DM and liver disease in SA. Methods We developed a microsimulation of the SA population to quantify the future incidence and direct health care costs of obesity-attributable T2DM and liver disease, including liver cancer. Model inputs included population demographics, body mass index, incidence, mortality and direct health care costs of T2DM and liver disease and relative risks of each condition as a function of BMI category. Model outputs included age- and sex-disaggregated incidence of obesity-attributable T2DM and liver disease and their direct health care costs for SA’s working-age population (20–59 years) between 2020 and 2040. Results Between 2020 and 2040, the available data predicts 1,976,593 [± 1834] new cases of T2DM, 285,346 [±874] new cases of chronic liver diseases, and 2,101 [± 150] new cases of liver cancer attributable to obesity, amongst working-age people. By 2040, the direct health care costs of these obesity-attributable diseases are predicted to be 127,956,508,540 [± 51,882,446] USD. Conclusions The increase in obesity-associated T2DM and liver disease emphasises the urgent need for obesity interventions and strategies to meaningfully reduce the future health and economic burden of T2DM, chronic liver diseases and liver cancer in SA."
https://openalex.org/W4285387816,"Short-chain fatty acids contribute to normal bowel function and prevent bacterial infections. In particular, butyrate is a promising candidate that plays an important role in regulating the functional integrity of the gastrointestinal tract by stimulating mucin secretion. We investigated whether butyrate treatment modulates mucin secretion and bacterial adherence in LoVo cells. In addition, the possible signaling pathways were also examined in connection with the upregulation of mucin secretion. The results showed that butyrate induced mucin secretion in LoVo cells, resulting in the inhibition of Escherichia coli adhesion by increasing the adherence of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum. The gene expression analysis suggests that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways including Cdc42-PAK pathway appears to be involved in stimulating mucin secretion. More importantly, butyrate induced the increased actin expression and polymerization in LoVo cells, which could be attributable to the Cdc42-PAK signaling pathway, implicated in actin cytoskeleton and mucin secretion. Our results provide a molecular basis in modulating bacterial adherence and the MAPK signaling pathway for the improved homeostasis of colonic epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W4285388051,"There is a growing interest in specifying the mechanisms underlying refreshing, i.e., the use of attention to keep working memory (WM) contents accessible. Here, we examined whether participants’ visual fixations during the retention interval of a WM task indicate the current focus of internal attention, thereby serving as an online measure of refreshing. Eye movements were recorded while participants studied and maintained an array of colored dots followed by probed recall of one (Experiments 1A and 1B) or all (Experiment 2) of the memoranda via a continuous color wheel. Experiments 1A and 2 entailed an unfilled retention interval in which refreshing is assumed to occur spontaneously, and Experiment 1B entailed a retention interval embedded with cues prompting the sequential refreshment of a subset of the memoranda. During the retention interval, fixations revisited the locations occupied by the memoranda, consistent with a looking-at-nothing phenomenon in WM, but the pattern was only evident when placeholders were onscreen in Experiment 2, indicating that most of these fixations may largely reflect random gaze. Furthermore, spontaneous fixations did not predict recall precision (Experiments 1A and 2), even when ensuring that they did not reflect random gaze (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1B, refreshing cues increased fixations to the eventually tested target and predicted better recall precision, which interacted with an overall benefit of target fixations, such that the benefit of fixations decreased as the number of refreshing cues increased. Thus, fixations under spontaneous conditions had no credible effect on recall precision, whereas the beneficial effect of fixations under instructed refreshing conditions may indicate situations in which cues were disregarded. Consequently, we conclude that eye movements do not seem suitable as an online measure of refreshing."
https://openalex.org/W4285492821,"Constructing engineered human skeletal muscle tissues that resemble the function and microstructure of human skeletal muscles is key to utilizing them in a variety of applications such as drug development, disease modeling, regenerative medicine, and engineering biological machines. However, current in vitro skeletal muscle tissues are far inferior to native muscles in terms of contractile function and lack essential cues for muscle functions, particularly heterotypic cell-cell interactions between myoblasts, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. Here, we develop an engineered muscle tissue with a coaxial three-layered tubular structure composed of an inner endothelial cell layer, an endomysium-like layer with fibroblasts in the middle, and an outer skeletal muscle cell layer, similar to the architecture of native skeletal muscles. Engineered skeletal muscle tissues with three spatially organized cell types produced thicker myotubes and lowered Young's modulus through extracellular matrix remodeling, resulting in 43% stronger contractile force. Furthermore, we demonstrated that fibroblasts localized in the endomysium layer induced angiogenic sprouting of endothelial cells into the muscle layer more effectively than fibroblasts homogeneously distributed in the muscle layer. This layered tri-culture system enables a structured spatial configuration of the three main cell types of skeletal muscle and promotes desired paracrine signaling, resulting in improved angiogenesis and increased contractile force. This research offers new insights to efficiently obtain new human skeletal muscle models, transplantable tissues, and actuators for biological machines."
https://openalex.org/W4285492956,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) are widely utilized for conservation of the world's marine resources. Yet, compliance with MPA regulations remains difficult to measure because of limits to human resources and a lack of affordable technologies to automate monitoring over time. The Marine Monitor, an autonomous vessel monitoring, recording, and reporting system leveraging commercial off-the-shelf X-band marine radar to detect and track vessels, was used to monitor five nearshore California MPAs simultaneously and continuously to identify and compare site-specific use patterns over one year. Vessel tracks were classified into two movement patterns to capture likely fishing activity, ""focal"" or ""linear"", that corresponded with local targeted species. Some illegal fishing potentially occurred at all sites (7-17% of tracks depending on site) most frequently on weekends and at mid-day, but the majority of activity occurred just outside the MPAs and in the near vicinity suggesting both a high level of compliance with regulations and awareness of MPA boundaries. Time spent engaged in potential fishing activity compared to track counts suggests that unique vessels may spend more time fishing inside area boundaries at some sites than others. The spatial distribution of activity shows distinct concentrations near MPA boundaries at all sites which strongly suggests vessels purposefully target the narrow area at the MPA boundary or ""fish the line"", a potential acknowledgement of successful spillover. This activity increased significantly during some local fishing seasons. Concentration of activity at MPA boundaries highlights the importance of continuous monitoring at a high spatial and temporal resolution. Reporting of vessel behavior at a fine-scale using radar can help resource managers target enforcement efforts and understand human use patterns near coastal MPAs."
https://openalex.org/W4285493044,"Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB) is diagnosed through sputum samples. As sputum sampling is challenging in children and cachexic patients, the development of diagnostic tests using saliva appears promising but has been discouraged due to low bacterial load and poor sensitivity. Here, we present a novel and rapid method to enrich Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) from saliva, which may serve as a basis for a diagnostic saliva test.Lipobiotin-functionalized magnetic beads (LMBs) were incubated with Mtb-spiked PBS and saliva from healthy donors as well as with saliva from TB patients. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the capacity of the beads to bind Mtb, while real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was utilized to detect Mtb and determine the amount of mycobacterial DNA in different sample types.We found that LMBs bind Mtb efficiently when compared to non-functionalized beads. The development of an qPCR assay based on the use of LMBs (LMB assay) allowed us to enrich mycobacterial DNA in spiked sample types, including PBS and saliva from healthy donors (enrichment of up to ~8.7 fold). In Mtb-spiked saliva samples, we found that the LMB assay improved the detection rate of 102 bacteria in a volume of 5 ml from 0 out of 15 (0%) to 6 out of 15 (40%). Consistent with that, the LMB assay increased the rate of correctly identified saliva samples from TB patients in two independent cohorts.Implementation of the principle of the LMB-based assay may improve the sensitivity of existing diagnostic techniques, e.g. by functionalizing materials that facilitate Mtb sampling from the oral cavity."
https://openalex.org/W4285495470,"Point-of-care lung ultrasound (LU) is an established tool in the first assessment of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To assess the progression or regression of respiratory failure in critically ill patients with COVID-19 on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) by using LU.We analyzed all patients admitted to Internal Intensive Care Unit, Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) of Munich, from March 2020 to December 2020 suffering lung failure caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). LU was performed according to a standardized protocol at baseline and at follow up every other day for the first 15 days using a lung ultrasound score (LUSS). Ventilation data were collected simultaneously.Our study included 42 patients. At admission to ICU, 19 of them (45%) were mechanically ventilated. Of the non-invasive ventilated ones (n = 23, 55%), eleven patients required invasive ventilation over the course. While LUS did not differ at admission to ICU between the invasive ventilated ones (at baseline or during ICU stay) compared to the non-invasive ventilated ones (12±4 vs 11±2 points, p = 0.2497), LUS was significantly lower at d7 for those, who had no need for invasive ventilation over the course (13±5 vs 7±4 points, p = 0.0046). Median time of invasive ventilation counted 18 days; the 90-day mortality was 24% (n = 10) in our cohort. In case of increasing LUS between day 1 (d1) and day 7 (d7), 92% (n = 12/13) required invasive ventilation, while it was 57% (n = 10/17) in case of decreasing LUS. At d7 we found significant correlation between LU and FiO2 (Pearson 0.591; p = 0.033), p/F ratio (Pearson -0.723; p = 0.005), PEEP (Pearson 0.495; p = 0.043), pplat (Pearson 0.617; p = 0.008) and compliance (Pearson -0.572; p = 0.016).LUS can be a useful tool in monitoring of progression and regression of respiratory failure and in indicating intubation in patients with COVID-19 in the ICU."
https://openalex.org/W4285386179,"In a cell-based non-invasive prenatal test (cbNIPT), intact circulating trophoblasts (CTs) are isolated from maternal blood for subsequent genetic analysis. Enrichment of these CTs from maternal blood is the most challenging step in the cbNIPT workflow. This study aims to assess the suitability of the filtration-based Metacell® technology to enrich CTs from maternal blood at week 10 to 13 of gestation. The Metacell® technology is a novel size-based enrichment technology that combines blood filtration through 8 μm pores with an in vitro culture method. Three protocols were evaluated. First, 8 mL or 16 mL of maternal blood was filtered and subsequently cultured in vitro on the separation membrane for 3 days in RPMI 1640. In addition, 16 mL of maternal blood was filtered, and immediately processed without further culturing. Y-chromosome-specific qPCR or STR analysis was performed to evaluate the enrichment of CTs. A total of 44 samples from pregnant women, out of which 26 were carrying a male fetus, were processed. Although five enriched male fetus samples show detectable male DNA quantities, it cannot be excluded that the obtained positive signal is caused by cell-free fetal DNA sticking to the Metacell® separation membrane. In conclusion, the Metacell® technology, tested as described, is not suitable for consistent enrichment of CTs."
https://openalex.org/W4285386424,"Dual energy computed tomography (DECT) allows the quantification of specific materials such as iodine contrast agent in human body tissue, potentially providing additional diagnostic data. Yet full diagnostic value can only be achieved if physiological normal values for iodine concentrations are known. We retrospectively evaluated abdominal DECT scans of 105 patients with healthy liver between March and August 2018 (age 17 to 86 years, 43 female and 62 male). The iodine concentrations within ROIs of the liver parenchyma as well as of the abdominal aorta and main portal vein were obtained. We evaluated the absolute iodine concentration and blood-normalized iodine concentrations relating the measured iodine concentration of the liver parenchyma to those of the supplying vessels. The influence of age and gender on the iodine uptake was assessed. The absolute iodine concentration was significantly different for the male and female cohort, but the difference was eliminated by the blood-normalized values. The average blood-normalized iodine concentrations were 2.107 mg/ml (+/- 0.322 mg/ml), 2.125 mg/ml (+/- 0.426 mg/ml) and 2.103 mg/ml (+/- 0.317 mg/ml) for the portal vein normalized, aorta normalized and mixed blood normalized iodine concentrations, respectively. A significant negative correlation between the patients’ age and the iodine concentration was detected only for the blood-normalized values. A physiological range for iodine concentration in portal venous phase contrast enhanced DECT images can be defined for absolute and blood-normalized values. Deviations of blood-normalized iodine concentration values might be a robust biomarker for diagnostic evaluation. Patient age but not the gender influences the blood-normalized iodine concentrations in healthy liver parenchyma."
https://openalex.org/W4285387729,"Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori ) is widely known as a cause of gastric disorders. Presence of H . pylori in dental pulp has been reported. Dental caries may influence the presence or absence of systemic H . pylori infection by serving as a source of H . pylori . In this cross-sectional study, we examined whether H . pylori infection in blood were associated with dental caries in Japanese adults. The participants were 752 individuals (513 males and 239 females, mean age 53.8 years) who underwent both H . pylori testing ( H . pylori antibody test and pepsinogen test) and dental checkups at the Asahi University Hospital Human Health Center between April 2018 and March 2019. Those diagnosed as positive for H . pylori antibody test or positive for serum pepsinogen test as H . pylori test in the human health checkup were judged as those with H . pylori infection in the blood. In our study, 83 participants (11%) were determined to be infected with H . pylori in the blood. The proportion of those with decayed teeth was higher in participants with H . pylori infection in blood than in those without H . pylori infection in blood (p&lt; 0.001). The logistic analysis showed that presence of H . pylori infection in blood was positively associated with those with decayed teeth (OR, 5.656; 95% CI, 3.374 to 9.479) after adjusting for age, gender, gastric disease, regular dental checkups, antibiotic medication history, and decayed teeth. Furthermore, the proportion of H . pylori infection in blood increased according to number of decayed teeth (p&lt; 0.001). The results indicate that H . pylori infection in blood were associated with decayed teeth. Untreated dental caries may have an impact on systemic H . pylori infection."
https://openalex.org/W4285389229,"Bacteria employ secondary metabolism to combat competitors, and xenobiotic metabolism to survive their chemical environment. This project has aimed to introduce a bacterial collection enabling comprehensive comparative investigations of those functions. The collection comprises 120 strains ( Proteobacteria , Actinobacteria and Firmicutes ), and was compiled on the basis of the broad taxonomic range of isolates and their postulated biosynthetic and/or xenobiotic detoxification capabilities. The utility of the collection was demonstrated in two ways: first, by performing 5144 co-cultures, recording inhibition between isolates and employing bioinformatics to predict biosynthetic gene clusters in sequenced genomes of species; second, by screening for xenobiotic sensitivity of isolates against 2-benzoxazolinone and 2-aminophenol. The co-culture medium of Bacillus siamensis D9 and Lysinibacillus sphaericus DSM 28 T was further analysed for possible antimicrobial compounds, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and guided by computational predictions and the literature. Finally, LC-MS analysis demonstrated N- acetylation of 3,4-dichloroaniline (a toxic pesticide residue of concern) by the actinobacterium Tsukamurella paurometabola DSM 20162 T which is highly tolerant of the xenobiotic. Microbial collections enable ""pipeline"" comparative screening of strains: on the one hand, bacterial co-culture is a promising approach for antibiotic discovery; on the other hand, bioremediation is effective in combating pollution, but requires knowledge of microbial xenobiotic metabolism. The presented outcomes are anticipated to pave the way for studies that may identify bacterial strains and/or metabolites of merit in biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W4285490841,"Roughly a third of the surgical procedures the World Bank is prioritizing as essential and cost-effective are orthopedic procedures. Yet in much of the developing world, prohibitive costs are a substantial barrier to universal access. One area where this is clear is surgical fracture tables, which generally cost &gt;US$200,000 new. With the advent of 3-D printing, a new way to reduce medical equipment costs is to use open source hardware licensed designs to fabricate digitally-distributed manufactured medical hardware. That approach is applied here to make surgical tables more accessible. This study describes the design and manufacture of an open source surgical fracture table that uses materials that are widely available worldwide with specialty components being 3-D printed. The bill of materials and assembly instructions are detailed and the fracture table is validated to perform mechanically to specifications. Using an open source desktop RepRap-class 3-D printer, the components can be printed in a little over a week of continuous printing. Including the 3-D printed parts, the open source fracture table can be constructed for under US$3,000 in material costs, representing a 98.5% savings for commercial systems, radically increasing accessibility. The open source table can be adjusted 90–116 cm in height, tilted from +/-15 degrees, the leg height ranges from 31 to 117 cm, the arm supports and foot holder both have a 180-degree range, the foot position has a 54 cm range, and the legs can be adjusted from 55 to 120 degrees. It is mechanically adjusted so does not require electricity, however, surgical staff need to be trained on how to perform needed adjustments during surgery. The open source surgical table has verified performance for mechanical loading over 130 kg, geometric flexibility to allow for wide array of common surgeries, is radiolucent in surgical zones, and is modular and upgradeable."
https://openalex.org/W4285491729,"The Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) comprises a widespread group of slowly-growing bacteria from the Mycobacteriaceae . These bacteria are responsible for opportunistic infections in humans and animals, including farm animals. The aim of the study was to determine whether it is possible to predict the presence of M . avium in pig lymph nodes based on the size and type of lesions found during post-mortem examination at a slaughterhouse. Lymph nodes were collected from 10,600 pigs subjected to such post-mortem examination. The nodes were classified with regard to their quality, and the number of tuberculosis-like lesions; following this, 86 mandibular lymph nodes with lesions and 113 without visible macroscopic lesions were selected for further study. Cultures were established on Löwenstein - Jensen and Stonebrink media , and a commercial GenoType Mycobacterium CM test was used to identify and differentiate M . avium species. The prevalence of M . avium was 56.98% in the lymph nodes with lesions and 19.47% in the unchanged ones. Statistical analysis indicated that visual assessment of lesions in the mandibular lymph nodes, in particular the number of tuberculous lesions, is a highly-efficient diagnostic tool. Similar results were obtained for estimated percentage area affected by the lesion, i.e. the ratio of the changed area of the lymph node in cross-section to the total cross-sectional area of the lymph node; however, this method is more laborious and its usefulness in slaughterhouse conditions is limited. By incising the lymph nodes and assessing the number of tuberculosis-like lesions, it is possible to limit the inclusion of meat from pigs infected with M . avium into the human food chain."
https://openalex.org/W4285492167,"In the last two decades transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV positive men who have sex with men (MSM) has been reported globally. Chemsex and specific sexual practices have been identified as risk factors. Our study aimed to identify risk factors for HCV transmission in MSM living with HIV attending in Mexico.We conducted a case-control study from April to December 2019 at the Hospital de Infectología ""La Raza"" National Medical Center, in Mexico City. A case was defined as an HIV-infected MSM with positive HCV-antibody test. For each case, 3 controls were included, defined as HIV infected MSM with negative HCV-antibody test. A self-questionnaire covering sexual practices and other risk factors for HCV transmission was applied. Bivariate analysis was performed to obtain odds ratio (OR) using Chi-square test. Independent risk factors were identified in a subsequent analysis performing a logistic regression model.A total of 324 patients participated in the study, 81 cases and 243 controls. Median age was 30.5 years (IQR: 18-52) and 28.8 years (IQR: 21-45) in the case and control group, respectively. Most prevalent HCV genotype was 1a (79%). In the logistic regression model, sharing straw during cocaine inhalation (OR: 9.03; 95% CI; 1.35-13.52; P = 0.003), sharing sex toys (OR: 17.53, 95% CI; 6.85-44.86; P = 0.002), and ethyl chloride use for chemsex (OR: 2.26; 95% CI; 1.29-5.56; P = 0.037) were significant risk factors for HCV infection.This study identifies risk factors for HCV transmission in Mexico in HIV positive MSM in congruence with the findings of many studies performed worldwide. This is the first study that indicates a possible association between ethyl chloride use in chemsex and HCV infection. Assessment of local populations for risk factors for HCV transmission may help to develop specifically targeted behavioral interventions to reduce HCV transmission."
https://openalex.org/W4285492403,"Diabetes management is complex and requires several lifestyle modifications and engagement in self-management behaviours to prevent complications and to improve health outcomes. Adequate disease knowledge is required in order to engage in appropriate self-management behaviours. Yet, patients' knowledge of diabetes and associated factors are scarcely investigated. Context-specific data on diabetes knowledge are crucial for designing appropriate interventions for improving knowledge and treatment outcomes. This study examined the level of diabetes knowledge and its associated factors among persons with diabetes in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.We conducted a cross-sectional study among 399 individuals attending diabetes care at six randomly selected primary healthcare facilities in Eastern Cape. Demographic data were obtained through questionnaire interviews while diabetes knowledge was assessed using the validated Michigan Diabetes Knowledge Test questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to assess the mean diabetes knowledge and its associated factors.Participants' median age was 63 (IQR: 54-70) years, and the median diabetes duration was 6 (IQR: 3-13) years. From a total score of 20, participants' knowledge of diabetes ranged from 0 to 17 with an average score of 7.5 (SD±2.2). After controlling for relevant covariates, being employed was positively associated with higher diabetes knowledge (p<0.001). However, health facility level was negatively associated with diabetes knowledge (p = 0.001). Participants receiving care at the community healthcare centres had a lower level of diabetes knowledge compared to those receiving care at the primary healthcare clinics.There was a low level of knowledge on the various components of diabetes management among individuals with diabetes in this setting. Therefore, context-specific interventions to improve the knowledge of diabetes is required and should target unemployed individuals and the community health centres in the region."
https://openalex.org/W4285030751,"TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a nucleic acid-binding protein found in the nucleus that accumulates in the cytoplasm under pathological conditions, leading to proteinopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia and ALS. An emerging area of TDP-43 research is represented by the study of its post-translational modifications, the way they are connected to disease-associated mutations, and what this means for pathological processes. Recently, we described a novel mutation in TDP-43 in an early onset ALS case that was affecting a potential phosphorylation site in position 375 (S375G). A preliminary characterization showed that both the S375G mutation and its phosphomimetic variant, S375E, displayed altered nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution and cellular toxicity. To better investigate these effects, here we established cell lines expressing inducible WT, S375G, and S375E TDP-43 variants. Interestingly, we found that these mutants do not seem to affect well-studied aspects of TDP-43, such as RNA splicing or autoregulation, or protein conformation, dynamics, or aggregation, although they do display dysmorphic nuclear shape and cell cycle alterations. In addition, RNA-Seq analysis of these cell lines showed that although the disease-associated S375G mutation and its phosphomimetic S375E variant regulate distinct sets of genes, they have a common target in mitochondrial apoptotic genes. Taken together, our data strongly support the growing evidence that alterations in TDP-43 post-translational modifications can play a potentially important role in disease pathogenesis and provide a further link between TDP-43 pathology and mitochondrial health."
https://openalex.org/W4285045882,"The soil-dwelling bacterium Pseudomonas putida S16 can survive on nicotine as its sole carbon and nitrogen source. The enzymes nicotine oxidoreductase (NicA2) and pseudooxynicotine amine oxidase (Pnao), both members of the flavin-containing amine oxidase family, catalyze the first two steps in the nicotine catabolism pathway. Our laboratory has previously shown that, contrary to other members of its enzyme family, NicA2 is actually a dehydrogenase that uses a cytochrome c protein (CycN) as its electron acceptor. The natural electron acceptor for Pnao is unknown; however, within the P. putida S16 genome, pnao forms an operon with cycN and nicA2, leading us to hypothesize that Pnao may also be a dehydrogenase that uses CycN as its electron acceptor. Here we characterized the kinetic properties of Pnao and show that Pnao is poorly oxidized by O2, but can be rapidly oxidized by CycN, indicating that Pnao indeed acts as a dehydrogenase that uses CycN as its oxidant. Comparing steady-state kinetics with transient kinetic experiments revealed that product release primarily limits turnover by Pnao. We also resolved the crystal structure of Pnao at 2.60 Å, which shows that Pnao has a similar structural fold as NicA2. Furthermore, rigid-body docking of the structure of CycN with Pnao and NicA2 identified a potential conserved binding site for CycN on these two enzymes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that although Pnao and NicA2 show a high degree of similarity to flavin containing amine oxidases that use dioxygen directly, both enzymes are actually dehydrogenases."
https://openalex.org/W4285388103,"Background Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for most new HIV diagnoses in the US. Annual HIV testing is recommended for sexually active MSM if HIV status is negative or unknown. Our primary study aim was to determine annual HIV screening rates in primary care across multiple years for HIV-negative MSM to estimate compliance with guidelines. A secondary exploratory endpoint was to document rates for non-MSM in primary care. Methods We conducted a three-year retrospective cohort study, analyzing data from electronic medical records of HIV-negative men aged 18 to 45 years in primary care at a large academic health system using inferential and logistic regression modeling. Results Of 17,841 men, 730 (4.1%) indicated that they had a male partner during the study period. MSM were screened at higher rates annually than non-MSM (about 38% vs. 9%, p&lt;0.001). Younger patients (p-value&lt;0.001) and patients with an internal medicine primary care provider (p-value&lt;0.001) were more likely to have an HIV test ordered in both groups. For all categories of race and self-reported illegal drug use, MSM patients had higher odds of HIV test orders than non-MSM patients. Race and drug use did not have a significant effect on HIV orders in the MSM group. Among non-MSM, Black patients had higher odds of being tested than both White and Asian patients regardless of drug use. Conclusions While MSM are screened for HIV at higher rates than non-MSM, overall screening rates remain lower than desired, particularly for older patients and patients with a family medicine or pediatric PCP. Targeted interventions to improve HIV screening rates for MSM in primary care are discussed."

An interviewer-administered questionnaire-based symptom analysis and clinical assessment was conducted in the first and second trimesters.We recruited 3374 pregnant women aged 15-48 years at conception. Self-reported physician-diagnosed asthma prevalence was 6.6% (n = 223) with only 41.7% (n = 93) on regular medical follow-up for asthma. The prevalence of wheeze reduced from pre-pregnancy (67.0%) to the first (46.4%) and second trimesters (47.7%; p<0.01). Of the 73 asthmatic women who did not have wheeze in the last 3 months preceding pregnancy, new-onset wheeze was reported by 6(8.2%) and 12(16.4%) in the first and second trimester, respectively. Pregnant women who sought medical care for asthma in the private sector had a lower likelihood of developing new-onset wheeze in the first trimester (p = 0.03; unadjusted OR = 0.94;95%CI 0.89-0.99). Thirty-four (33.3%) pregnant women had at least one hospital admission due to exacerbation of wheeze during the first and second trimester. The prevalence of low birth weight (16.0%) was higher among pregnant asthmatic women.This study reports the high prevalence of asthma and asthma-associated pregnancy outcomes in women from a rural geography signifying the importance of targeted management."
https://openalex.org/W4285490959,"This study aimed to explore how youth players' physical, technical and positional performance may be affected by visual occlusion when playing under different SSG pitch sizes. Under-15 players performed two experimental scenarios: a) normal situation, without visual occlusion; b) visual occlusion, by using an eye patch in the eye corresponding to the dominant foot. These scenarios were tested in a small (40x30m) and a larger pitch (50x35m). Players' positional data was used to compute tactical and time-motion variables. In addition, technical analysis was comprised using video footage. Playing with visual occlusion in the larger pitch size induced higher distance covered while walking but lower running distance (p < .05). Although no statistically significant effects were identified between the normal and visual occlusion conditions for the tactical behaviour and technical performance a lower number of successful passes (small to moderate effect sizes) and higher regularity in the distance to the opponent's team centroid (moderate effect size) were found with visual occlusion. Players covered more distance and achieved higher maximum speed in the larger compared to the small pitch (moderate to large effect size, p < .05), while also increasing their distance to both team's centroid and increasing the regularity to these distances (moderate to large effect size, p < .05). Overall, despite similar effects for tactical and technical variables, some important practical information can be depicted. Accordingly, coaches may use the visual occlusion to promote more stable and regular behaviors while decreasing the physical demands. Larger pitches may be used to increase the distance between players' and teams, as well as to induce higher physical load in both the normal and visual occlusion conditions. From the technical perspective, coaches may design smaller pitches to emphasize the use of the non-dominant foot during the occlusion scenario and promote the pass during the normal scenario."
https://openalex.org/W4285491536,"Background Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) remains a disease of global health concern and a leading cause of mortality arising from an infectious agent. Protective immunity to TB remains unclear. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) and signal transduction and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) genes have shown potential to influence innate immunity. We, therefore, explored the expression of SOCS3 and STAT3 and their implications on the innate immunity in TB patients and their healthy close contacts. Methods We recruited 72 TB patients and 62 healthy contacts from a high TB and HIV endemic setting (Lusaka, Zambia). We used RT-PCRT and flow cytometry to quantify the expression of SOCS, STAT3 and cytokines respectively. Data was analysed Stata version 14.0 and figures were developed in GraphPad prism version 9.1.0 (221). Assessment for associations for categorical and continuous variables was analysed using the Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney test respectively. Spearman’s rank correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between SOCS3 and IL-6. A p -value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Healthy contacts markedly expressed SOCS3 in both unstimulated and stimulated whole blood in comparison to TB patients ( p &lt;0.0001). STAT3 was elevated in TB patients in TB patients in stimulated blood only. IL-6 ( P = &lt; 0.0001) and IL-10 ( P = &lt;0.0001), were significantly expressed in Healthy contacts in comparison to TB patients. TNF-α ( p = 0.044) were markedly elevated in TB patients in comparison to healthy contacts. IL-6 and SOCS3 correlated significantly in healthy contacts only (r = 0.429, p = 0.02). Conclusions Both SOCS3 and STAT3 are genes of importance in mounting protective innate immunity against TB. We propose that SOCS3 stimulation and inhibition of STAT3 as possible approaches in gene therapy and vaccine development for TB."
https://openalex.org/W4285493037,"Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory condition caused by periodontal pathogens in the gingival sulcus. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by causal bacteria are closely related to the onset and progression of periodontal disease and have been reported to proliferate in the periodontal sulcus of patients experiencing this pathology. In such patients, propionic acid (C3), butyric acid (C4), isobutyric acid (IC4), valeric acid (C5), isovaleric acid (IC5), and caproic acid (C6), henceforth referred to as [C3–C6], has been reported to have a detrimental effect, while acetic acid (C2) exhibits no detrimental effect. In this study, we established an inexpensive and simple enzymatic assay that can fractionate and measure these acids. The possibility of applying this technique to determine the severity of periodontal disease by adapting it to specimens collected from humans has been explored. We established an enzyme system using acetate kinase and butyrate kinase capable of measuring SCFAs in two fractions, C2 and [C3–C6]. The gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and saliva of 10 healthy participants and 10 participants with mild and severe periodontal disease were measured using the established enzymatic method and conventional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The quantification of C2 and [C3–C6] in human GCF and saliva was well correlated when using the GC–MS method. Furthermore, both C2 and [C3–C6] in the GCF increased with disease severity. However, while no significant difference was observed between healthy participants and periodontal patients when using saliva, [C3–C6] significantly differed between mild and severe periodontal disease. The enzymatic method was able to measure C2 and [C3–C6] separately as well as using the GC–MS method. Furthermore, the C2 and [C3–C6] fractions of GCF correlated with disease severity, suggesting that this method can be applied clinically. In contrast, the quantification of C2 and [C3–C6] in saliva did not differ significantly between healthy participants and patients with periodontal disease. Future studies should focus on inflammation rather than on tissue destruction."
https://openalex.org/W4285586462,"Acute liver injury is a common disease without effective therapy in humans. We sought to evaluate a combination therapy of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) and BTP-2 in a mouse liver injury model induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We chose this model because LPS is known to increase the expression of the transcription factors related to systemic inflammation (i.e., NFκB, CREB, AP1, IRF 3, and NFAT), which depends on calcium signaling. Notably, these transcription factors all have pleiotropic effects and account for the other observed changes in tissue damage parameters. Additionally, LPS is also known to increase the genes associated with a tissue injury (e.g., NGAL, SOD, caspase 3, and type 1 collagen) and systemic expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Finally, LPS compromises vascular integrity. Accordingly, IGF-I was selected because its serum levels were shown to decrease during systemic inflammation. BTP-2 was chosen because it was known to decrease cytosolic calcium, which is increased by LPS. This current study showed that IGF-I, BTP-2, or a combination therapy significantly altered and normalized all of the aforementioned LPS-induced gene changes. Additionally, our therapies reduced the vascular leakage caused by LPS, as evidenced by the Evans blue dye technique. Furthermore, histopathologic studies showed that IGF-I decreased the proportion of hepatocytes with ballooning degeneration. Finally, IGF-I also increased the expression of the hepatic growth factor (HGF) and the receptor for the epidermal growth factor (EGFR), markers of liver regeneration. Collectively, our data suggest that a combination of IGF-I and BTP-2 is a promising therapy for acute liver injury."
https://openalex.org/W4285005484,"Isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) catalyzes formation of the β-lactam and thiazolidine rings of isopenicillin N from its linear tripeptide l-δ-(α-aminoadipoyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valine (ACV) substrate in an iron- and dioxygen (O2)-dependent four-electron oxidation without precedent in current synthetic chemistry. Recent X-ray free-electron laser studies including time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography show that binding of O2 to the IPNS-Fe(II)-ACV complex induces unexpected conformational changes in α-helices on the surface of IPNS, in particular in α3 and α10. However, how substrate binding leads to conformational changes away from the active site is unknown. Here, using detailed 19F NMR and electron paramagnetic resonance experiments with labeled IPNS variants, we investigated motions in α3 and α10 induced by binding of ferrous iron, ACV, and the O2 analog nitric oxide, using the less mobile α6 for comparison. 19F NMR studies were carried out on singly and doubly labeled α3, α6, and α10 variants at different temperatures. In addition, double electron-electron resonance electron paramagnetic resonance analysis was carried out on doubly spin-labeled variants. The combined spectroscopic and crystallographic results reveal that substantial conformational changes in regions of IPNS including α3 and α10 are induced by binding of ACV and nitric oxide. Since IPNS is a member of the structural superfamily of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases and related enzymes, related conformational changes may be of general importance in nonheme oxygenase catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W4285013782,"Cortical glutamate and midbrain dopamine neurotransmission converge to mediate striatum-dependent behaviors, while maladaptations in striatal circuitry contribute to mental disorders. However, the crosstalk between glutamate and dopamine signaling has not been entirely elucidated. Here we uncover a molecular mechanism by which glutamatergic and dopaminergic signaling integrate to regulate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) via phosphorylation of the PKA regulatory subunit, RIIβ. Using a combination of biochemical, pharmacological, neurophysiological, and behavioral approaches, we find that glutamate-dependent reduction in cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)-dependent RIIβ phosphorylation alters the PKA holoenzyme autoinhibitory state to increase PKA signaling in response to dopamine. Furthermore, we show that disruption of RIIβ phosphorylation by Cdk5 enhances cortico-ventral striatal synaptic plasticity. In addition, we demonstrate that acute and chronic stress in rats inversely modulate RIIβ phosphorylation and ventral striatal infusion of a small interfering peptide that selectively targets RIIβ regulation by Cdk5 improves behavioral response to stress. We propose this new signaling mechanism integrating ventral striatal glutamate and dopamine neurotransmission is important to brain function, may contribute to neuropsychiatric conditions, and serves as a possible target for the development of novel therapeutics for stress-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4285045722,"Faithful translation of the genetic code is critical for the viability of all living organisms. The trans-editing enzyme ProXp-ala prevents Pro to Ala mutations during translation by hydrolyzing misacylated Ala-tRNAPro that has been synthesized by prolyl-tRNA synthetase. Plant ProXp-ala sequences contain a conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) that is absent in other organisms; the origin, structure, and function of this extra domain are unknown. To characterize the plant-specific CTD, we performed bioinformatics and computational analyses that provided a model consistent with a conserved α-helical structure. We also expressed and purified wildtype Arabidopsis thaliana (At) ProXp-ala in Escherichia coli, as well as variants lacking the CTD or containing only the CTD. Circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed a loss of α-helical signal intensity upon CTD truncation. Size-exclusion chromatography with multiangle laser-light scattering revealed that wildtype At ProXp-ala was primarily dimeric and CTD truncation abolished dimerization in vitro. Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays in At protoplasts support a role for the CTD in homodimerization in vivo. The deacylation rate of Ala-tRNAPro by At ProXp-ala was also significantly reduced in the absence of the CTD, and kinetic assays indicated that the reduction in activity is primarily due to a tRNA binding defect. Overall, these results broaden our understanding of eukaryotic translational fidelity in the plant kingdom. Our study reveals that the plant-specific CTD plays a significant role in substrate binding and canonical editing function. Through its ability to facilitate protein-protein interactions, we propose the CTD may also provide expanded functional potential for trans-editing enzymes in plants."
https://openalex.org/W4285386794,"Introduction This study examined the association between simultaneity of four health-risk behaviours, namely, low levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (insufficient MVPA: &lt;420 min/week), tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and excessive television (TV)–(&gt;2 h/d of TV viewing) and self-rated health (SRH) in Brazilian adolescents. Methods We used data of 100,551 adolescents from the National School Health Survey, a national cross-sectional study carried out in 2015. Association between simultaneity of health risk behaviours (i.e. the ratio between observed and expected prevalence rates) and SRH was examined using logistic regression models. Results The majority of the participants were female (51.9%) and 14 years of age (50.6%), and 26% of the participants’ SRH ranged from ’average’ to ’extremely poor’. Those who engaged in the following combinations of health-risk behaviours had higher odds of worse SRH than their healthier counterparts: insufficient MVPA and tobacco use (odds ratio—OR: 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4 to 3.0); insufficient MVPA and alcohol consumption (OR: 1.6, 95%CI: 1.3 to 1.9); insufficient MVPA and &gt;2 h/day of TV viewing (OR: 1.3, 95%CI: 1.1 to 1.6); insufficient MVPA, tobacco use and alcohol consumption (OR: 2.1, 95%CI: 1.7, to 2.7); and insufficient MVPA, alcohol consumption and &gt;2 h/day of TV viewing (OR: 1.6, 95%CI: 1.4 to 2.0). Conclusions Insufficient MVPA, alcohol consumption, and other health-risk behaviours were associated with worse SRH in Brazilian adolescents."

Inhibition of cyclophilins has been already proposed to be efficient as a mitochondrial therapy in liver diseases. To investigate the effect of Cyclophilin D (CypD) depletion on mitochondrial function, biogenesis and liver regeneration following ALPPS a CypD knockout (KO) mice model was created.Male wild type (WT) (n = 30) and CypD KO (n = 30) mice underwent ALPPS procedure. Animals were terminated pre-operatively and 24, 48, 72 or 168 h after the operation. Mitochondrial functional studies and proteomic analysis were performed. Regeneration rate and mitotic activity were assessed.The CypD KO group displayed improved mitochondrial function, as both ATP production (P < 0.001) and oxygen consumption (P < 0.05) were increased compared to the WT group. The level of mitochondrial biogenesis coordinator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1-α (PGC1-α) was also elevated in the CypD KO group (P < 0.001), which resulted in the induction of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system. Liver growth increased in the CypD KO group compared to the WT group (P < 0.001).Our study demonstrates the beneficial effect of CypD depletion on the mitochondrial vulnerability following ALPPS. Based on our results we propose that CypD inhibition should be further investigated as a possible mitochondrial therapy following ALPPS."
https://openalex.org/W4285391158,"There is a substantial body of work in physics education looking at gender disparities in physics. Recent work has linked gender disparities in college physics course performance to disparities in high school physics preparation, but to our knowledge, the origin of the disparity in high school physics preparation is still underexplored. In a select sample, we found that women on average had lower force and motion conceptual evaluation (FMCE) pre-scores (the FMCE is a short conceptual assessment of Newton's laws), and FMCE pre-score entirely mediated the effects of high school preparation and social-psychological factors on exam performance. The gender gap in FMCE pre-scores could not be explained by differences in the number of physics courses taken in high school. Instead, we find that the gender gap in the FMCE is partially explained by female students' higher levels of general test anxiety. We hypothesize that the format of the FMCE, a timed assessment, triggers stereotype threat in female students despite being a low-stakes assessment. Therefore, instructors and researchers should take care in interpreting the results of such concept inventory scores and should re-think the way they assess understanding of physics concepts. Results of this work aligned with previous findings on gender disparity in timed exams call upon investigating gender equitable assessment formats for evaluating physics knowledge to replace timed assessments, either high or low stakes."

There is a shortage of relevant evidence that enforces policy makers to design intervention plans. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the health-risky road traffic noise pollution in Dessie City, Ethiopia.The study was conducted by purposive selection of the study area and sampling sites of the city from May 31, 2021 -June 6, 2021. Noise level recordings were taken by a digital Sound Meter and location data was collected by Global Positioning System. Residential, health facility, commercial, and mixed sites were identified by field observation. A total of 20 noise sampling points were included. The sampling points were selected by considering World Health Organization guideline. The measurements were taken twice a day at peak hours, between 8:00-11:00am and 4:00-7:00pm on all days of the week. The sound level meter was placed at a height of 1.5m and 2m from the curb. A total of 280 sound level records were conducted over one week.Among twenty noise recording sites, more than 50% of them registered as excessive noisy sites for all types of site categories (health facility, residential, commercial, and mixed areas). For the seven days, average noise recordings were in the range of 66-72 dB at 83% of mixed areas; 33% of health facilities; 25% of residential areas, and 86% of commercial areas. The highest levels of noise pollution were seen at the Bus-station, Buanbuawuha Square, Tekuam, Arada, Ethio General Hospital, Ersha-seble, and Menafesha areas.This study shows that the average noise level measurement within a week exceeded the permissible limits set by Ethiopia and the World Health Organization. It helps for policy development and timely actions against noise pollution and as baseline information for further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4285492239,"The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (TSPO/PBR) is highly conserved among different species but with perplexing biochemical functions. Multiple ligands of TSPO show commendable regulatory activities in lots of biological functions, such as neuro-protection, cholesterol transport, and so on. These researches support that TSPO may be a potential target for disease treatment and drug development. Previous studies have shown that its ligands benzodiazepines show a satisfactory effect on melanogenic promotion. However, the potential application of TSPO in drug development for pigmentary disorder needs further investigation. In this study, we confirmed the melanogenesis induction of TSPO ligand, Ro5-4864 in mouse melanoma cell lines, human skin tissue, and zebrafish embryos by inducing melanin synthesis and melanosome transport. Molecular genetics and pharmacological studies showed that TSPO deficiency did not affect melanin production in B16F10 cells and zebrafish embryos, nor did it affect the melanin promotion effect of Ro5-4864. Whether or not TSPO exists, the expression of lots of melanogenesis-related proteins, such as TYR, TRP-1, DCT, Mlph, and Rab27 was upregulated with the Ro5-4864 administration. These results indicated that Ro5-4864 induces melanogenesis in a TSPO-independent manner, which is inconsistent with previous research. This research is a reminder that we need to be very careful during target validation in drug development."

However, it remains unclear which spatio-temporal characteristics of facial movements serve as critical cues to the perceived genuineness of facial expressions. This study focused on observable spatio-temporal differences between perceived-as-genuine and deliberate expressions of happiness and anger expressions. In this experiment, 89 Japanese participants were asked to judge the perceived genuineness of faces in videos showing happiness or anger expressions. To identify diagnostic facial cues to the perceived genuineness of the facial expressions, we analyzed a total of 128 face videos using an automated facial action detection system; thereby, moment-to-moment activations in facial action units were annotated, and nonnegative matrix factorization extracted sparse and meaningful components from all action units data. The results showed that genuineness judgments reduced when more spatial patterns were observed in facial expressions. As for the temporal features, the perceived-as-deliberate expressions of happiness generally had faster onsets to the peak than the perceived-as-genuine expressions of happiness. Moreover, opening the mouth negatively contributed to the perceived-as-genuine expressions, irrespective of the type of facial expressions. These findings provide the first evidence for dynamic facial cues to the perceived genuineness of happiness and anger expressions."
https://openalex.org/W4285586220,"The presence of activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) microenvironment plays a significant role in cancer progression. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is overexpressed in PDAC tissues and expressed by both cancer and stromal cells. The pathophysiological role of MIF in PDAC-associated fibroblasts or PSCs is yet to be elucidated. Here we report that the PSCs of mouse or cancer-associated fibroblast cells (CAFs) of human expresses MIF and its receptors, whose expression gets upregulated upon LPS or TNF-α stimulation. In vitro functional experiments showed that MIF significantly conferred a survival advantage to CAFs/PSCs upon growth factor deprivation. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of MIF also corroborated these findings. Further, co-injection of mouse pancreatic cancer cells with PSCs isolated from Mif-/- or Mif+/+ mice confirmed the pro-survival effect of MIF in PSCs and also demonstrated the pro-tumorigenic role of MIF expressed by CAFs in vivo. Differential gene expression analysis and in vitro mechanistic studies indicated that MIF expressed by activated CAFs/PSCs confers a survival advantage to these cells by suppression of interferon pathway induced p53 dependent apoptosis."
