We investigated how the c-Met-mediated signaling through binding to its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) can modulate the apoptosis and immune escape mechanism(s) of renal cancer cells by the regulations of novel molecules heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and programmed death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). We found that HGF/c-Met-mediated signaling activated the Ras/Raf pathway and down-regulated cancer cell apoptosis; and it was associated with the overexpression of cytoprotective HO-1 and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2/Bcl-xL. c-Met-induced HO-1 overexpression was regulated at the transcriptional level. Next, we observed that c-Met induction markedly up-regulated the expression of the negative co-stimulatory molecule PD-L1, and this can be prevented following treatment of the cells with pharmacological inhibitors of c-Met. Interestingly, HGF/c-Met-mediated signaling could not induce PD-L1 at the optimum level when either Ras or HO-1 was knocked down. To study the functional significance of c-Met-induced PD-L1 expression, we performed a co-culture assay using mouse splenocytes (expressing PD-L1 receptor PD-1) and murine renal cancer cells (RENCA, expressing high PD-L1). We observed that the splenocyte-mediated apoptosis of cancer cells during co-culture was markedly increased in the presence of either c-Met inhibitor or PD-L1 neutralizing antibody. Finally, we found that both c-Met and PD-L1 are significantly up-regulated and co-localized in human renal cancer tissues. Together, our study suggests a novel mechanism(s) by which c-Met can promote increased survival of renal cancer cells through the regulation of HO-1 and PD-L1.

https://openalex.org/W2037748853,"The high morbidity of metabolic dysfunction diseases has heightened interest in seeking natural and safe compounds to maintain optimal health. γ-Oryzanol (OZ), the ferulic acid (FA) ester with phytosterols, mainly present in rice bran has been shown to improve markers of metabolic syndrome. This study investigates the effects of FA and OZ on alleviating high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD)-induced metabolic syndrome parameters.Male SD rats were fed with a regular rodent diet, HFFD, or HFFD supplemented with 0.05% FA or 0.16% OZ (equimolar concentrations) for 13 weeks. Food intake, organ indices, serum lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, insulin resistance (IR) index and cytokine levels were analyzed. The mechanisms were further investigated in oleic acid-stimulated HepG2 cells by analyzing triglyceride (TG) content and lipogenesis-related gene expressions.In the in vivo study, FA and OZ exhibited similar effects in alleviating HFFD-induced obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and IR. However, only OZ treatment significantly decreased liver index and hepatic TG content, lowered serum levels of C-reactive protein and IL-6, and increased serum concentration of adiponectin. In the in vitro assay, only OZ administration significantly inhibited intracellular TG accumulation and down-regulated expression of stearoyl coenzyme-A desaturase-1, which might facilitate OZ to enhance its hepatoprotective effect.OZ is more effective than FA in inhibiting hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation. Thus, FA and OZ could be used as dietary supplements to alleviate the deleterious effects of HFFD."

Asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation adds unprecedented structural and functional heterogeneity to polypeptide chains by the covalent attachment of oligosaccharides (hereafter called glycans) to motif-specific asparagine residues. Although advances in glycobiology and analytical glycoscience continually improve the understanding of protein N-glycosylation, the structure-function relationships of most protein glycoforms remain unknown. Dysregulation of protein N-glycosylation by the deletion or modulation of its diverse intra- and extracellular functions is a common cause and/or effect of numerous pathologies (1Freeze H.H.

Tiemeyer M. Nairn A.V. Vertebrate protein glycosylation: diversity, synthesis and function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 448-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the conserved mammalian N-glycosylation as a structural and functional modulator of proteins is most critically built on the principles of the well described glycoprotein biosynthetic machinery (3Aebi M. N-linked protein glycosylation in the ER.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1833: 2430-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The defined complex and dynamic enzymatic biosynthesis of glycoproteins in the secretory pathway produces three well recognized N-glycan classes that are abundantly displayed on mammalian proteins, i.e. high mannose, hybrid, and complex type, all of which are based on a common trimannosylated chitobiose core (2Moremen K.W. Tiemeyer M. Nairn A.V. Vertebrate protein glycosylation: diversity, synthesis and function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 448-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). Contrary to this dogma, several recent glycomics-based studies indicate that a fourth type of protein N-glycosylation, referred to as paucimannosylation, with monosaccharide compositions less than or equal to the N-glycan trimannosylchitobiose core, i.e. mannose(Man)1–3fucose(Fuc)0–1N-acetylglucosamine(GlcNAc)2, is present in mammals. These structures do not correspond to the defined N-glycan types nor can their synthesis be described by established mammalian biosynthetic pathways.

Importantly, these observations were all based on molecular profiling of N-glycans released from cell/tissue-derived proteins and thus disregarded the protein carrier identities.

Paucimannose synthesis in these species is facilitated by high β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity, allowing partial suppression of the complex N-glycan biosynthetic route. Although the exact functions and effector mechanisms still remain elusive, the N-glycosylation of the paucimannose-rich C. elegans and D. melanogaster has been associated with roles in the immune response against bacterial pathogens (19Shi H.

Boulianne G. Life is sweet! A novel role for N-glycans in Drosophila lifespan.Fly. 2011; 5: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Here, we present unequivocal evidence that paucimannosylation is also a significant host-derived molecular signature of sputum proteins from pathogen-infected human lungs. Enabled by recent developments in system-wide biomolecular detection, we document that inflammation-associated proteins, localizing to the azurophilic granules of human neutrophils, abundantly display paucimannosylation. In line with their presence in specific micro-environments that are central to inflammation and pathogen infection, we confirm that the timely expressed human azurophilic granule-resident β-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) enzymatically facilitates the generation of protein paucimannosylation by trimming hybrid/complex type N-glycan intermediates using a machinery, which is formed during early myeloid maturation, and functionally associate paucimannosidic proteins with roles in innate immunity upon secretion from activated human neutrophils. Saliva-free whole sputum (>1 ml/donor) was sampled with informed consent from individuals with (n = 5) or without (n = 4) CF by non-invasive expectoration at Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia (see Ref. 11Venkatakrishnan V.

Two of the non-CF individuals were diagnosed with URTI and two were diagnosed with pathogen-free pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The sputum of the seven pathogen-positive individuals was infected primarily by mucoid/non-mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but also Aspergillus fumigatus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were identified. P. aeruginosa laboratory wound (PAO1) and CF sputum (PASS1–4) strains were isolated and cultured (Table 1). Sputum from all donors showed inflammation characteristics (>1 × 1010 polymorphonuclear cells/l sputum).

The CF sputum proteome and N-glycoproteome were mapped following a crude fractionation on 4–12% SDS-PAGE (fractions 1–5: 65–100, 50–65, 35–50, 20–35, and 5–20 kDa, respectively). The fractions were digested individually in 20 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 (aq), pH 7.8, using porcine trypsin (Promega, 50 ng/μl, 8 h, 37 °C). The resulting peptide mixtures were used for proteome and glycoproteome mapping. N-Glycopeptides were de-N-glycosylated using 3 units of N-glycosidase F/fraction (12 h, 37 °C) and desalted prior to proteomics or enriched in their intact form using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography solid phase extraction prior to N-glycoproteomics as described (32Mysling S.

https://openalex.org/W2079402307,"There is a growing need to identify shark products in trade, in part due to the recent listing of five commercially important species on the Appendices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES; porbeagle, Lamna nasus, oceanic whitetip, Carcharhinus longimanus scalloped hammerhead, Sphyrna lewini, smooth hammerhead, S. zygaena and great hammerhead S. mokarran) in addition to three species listed in the early part of this century (whale, Rhincodon typus, basking, Cetorhinus maximus, and white, Carcharodon carcharias). Shark fins are traded internationally to supply the Asian dried seafood market, in which they are used to make the luxury dish shark fin soup. Shark fins usually enter international trade with their skin still intact and can be identified using morphological characters or standard DNA-barcoding approaches. Once they reach Asia and are traded in this region the skin is removed and they are treated with chemicals that eliminate many key diagnostic characters and degrade their DNA (“processed fins”). Here, we present a validated mini-barcode assay based on partial sequences of the cytochrome oxidase I gene that can reliably identify the processed fins of seven of the eight CITES listed shark species. We also demonstrate that the assay can even frequently identify the species or genus of origin of shark fin soup (31 out of 50 samples)."

https://openalex.org/W2000115025,"The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) is a ubiquitously expressed endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident calcium channel. Calcium release mediated by IP3Rs influences many signaling pathways, including those regulating apoptosis. IP3R activity is regulated by protein-protein interactions, including binding to proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors to regulate cell death. Here we show that the IP3R binds to the tumor suppressor BRCA1. BRCA1 binding directly sensitizes the IP3R to its ligand, IP3. BRCA1 is recruited to the ER during apoptosis in an IP3R-dependent manner, and, in addition, a pool of BRCA1 protein is constitutively associated with the ER under non-apoptotic conditions. This is likely mediated by a novel lipid binding activity of the first BRCA1 C terminus domain of BRCA1. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation by which BRCA1 can act as a proapoptotic protein."
https://openalex.org/W2042484616,"Renal cysts are clinically and genetically heterogeneous conditions. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most frequent life-threatening genetic disease and mainly caused by mutations in PKD1. The presence of six PKD1 pseudogenes and tremendous allelic heterogeneity make molecular genetic testing challenging requiring laborious locus-specific amplification. Increasing evidence suggests a major role for PKD1 in early and severe cases of ADPKD and some patients with a recessive form. Furthermore it is becoming obvious that clinical manifestations can be mimicked by mutations in a number of other genes with the necessity for broader genetic testing. We established and validated a sequence capture based NGS testing approach for all genes known for cystic and polycystic kidney disease including PKD1. Thereby, we demonstrate that the applied standard mapping algorithm specifically aligns reads to the PKD1 locus and overcomes the complication of unspecific capture of pseudogenes. Employing careful and experienced assessment of NGS data, the method is shown to be very specific and equally sensitive as established methods. An additional advantage over conventional Sanger sequencing is the detection of copy number variations (CNVs). Sophisticated bioinformatic read simulation increased the high analytical depth of the validation study and further demonstrated the strength of the approach. We further raise some awareness of limitations and pitfalls of common NGS workflows when applied in complex regions like PKD1 demonstrating that quality of NGS needs more than high coverage of the target region. By this, we propose a time- and cost-efficient diagnostic strategy for comprehensive molecular genetic testing of polycystic kidney disease which is highly automatable and will be of particular value when therapeutic options for PKD emerge and genetic testing is needed for larger numbers of patients."

Our previous study showed that EsxA exhibits a unique membrane-interacting activity that is not found in its ortholog from nonpathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis. However, the molecular mechanism of EsxA membrane insertion remains unknown. In this study, we generated truncated EsxA proteins with deletions of the N- and/or C-terminal flexible arm. Using a fluorescence-based liposome leakage assay, we found that both the N- and C-terminal arms were required for membrane disruption. Moreover, we found that, upon acidification, EsxA converted into a more organized structure with increased α-helical content, which was evidenced by CD analysis and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Finally, using an environmentally sensitive fluorescent dye, we obtained direct evidence that the central helix-turn-helix motif of EsxA inserted into the membranes and formed a membrane-spanning pore.

This study profiled differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs in gastric cancer tissues to construct a TF and miRNA co-regulatory network in order to identify altered genes in gastric cancer progression. A total of 70 cases gastric cancer and paired adjacent normal tissues were subjected to cDNA and miRNA microarray analyses. We obtained 887 up-regulated and 93 down-regulated genes and 41 down-regulated and 4 up-regulated miRNAs in gastric cancer tissues. Using the Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database, we obtained 105 genes that are regulated by the E2F family of genes and using Targetscan, miRanda, miRDB and miRWalk tools, we predicted potential targeting genes of these 45 miRNAs. We then built up the E2F-related TF and miRNA co-regulatory gene network and identified 9 hub-genes. Furthermore, we found that levels of E2F1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 mRNAs associated with gastric cancer cell invasion capacity, and has associated with tumor differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2037149533,"The murine Mafa transcription factor is a key regulator of postnatal islet β-cell activity, affecting insulin transcription, insulin secretion, and β-cell mass. Human MAFA expression is also markedly decreased in islet β-cells of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Moreover, levels are profoundly reduced in db/db islet β-cells, a mouse model of T2DM. To examine the significance of this key islet β-cell-enriched protein to glycemic control under diabetic conditions, we generated transgenic mice that conditionally and specifically produced Mafa in db/db islet β-cells. Sustained expression of Mafa resulted in significantly lower plasma glucose levels, higher plasma insulin, and augmented islet β-cell mass. In addition, there was increased expression of insulin, Slc2a2, and newly identified Mafa-regulated genes involved in reducing β-cell stress, like Gsta1 and Gckr. Importantly, the levels of human GSTA1 were also compromised in T2DM islets. Collectively, these results illustrate how consequential the reduction in Mafa activity is to islet β-cell function under pathophysiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2094649632,"Ground cover vegetation is often added or allowed to generate to promote conservation biological control, especially in perennial crops. Nevertheless, there is inconsistent evidence of its effectiveness, with studies reporting positive, nil or negative effects on pest control. This might arise from differences between studies at the local scale (e.g. orchard management and land use history), the landscape context (e.g. presence of patches of natural or semi-natural vegetation near the focal orchard), or regional factors, particularly climate in the year of the study. Here we present the findings from a long-term regional monitoring program conducted on four pest species (Bactrocera oleae, Prays oleae, Euphyllura olivina, Saissetia oleae) in 2,528 olive groves in Andalusia (Spain) from 2006 to 2012. Generalized linear mixed effect models were used to analyze the effect of ground cover on different response variables related to pest abundance, while accounting for variability at the local, landscape and regional scales. There were small and inconsistent effects of ground cover on the abundance of pests whilst local, landscape and regional variability explained a large proportion of the variability in pest response variables. This highlights the importance of local and landscape-related variables in biological control and the potential effects that might emerge from their interaction with practices, such as groundcover vegetation, implemented to promote natural enemy activity. The study points to perennial vegetation close to the focal crop as a promising alternative strategy for conservation biological control that should receive more attention."

In mammals, the H1 family includes seven somatic H1 variants; H1.1 to H1.5 are expressed in a replication-dependent manner, whereas H1.0 and H1X are replication-independent. Using ChIP-sequencing data and cell fractionation, we have compared the genomic distribution of H1.0 and H1X in human breast cancer cells, in which we previously observed differential distribution of H1.2 compared with the other subtypes. We have found H1.0 to be enriched at nucleolus-associated DNA repeats and chromatin domains, whereas H1X is associated with coding regions, RNA polymerase II-enriched regions, and hypomethylated CpG islands. Further, H1X accumulates within constitutive or included exons and retained introns and toward the 3′ end of expressed genes. Inducible H1X knockdown does not affect cell proliferation but dysregulates a subset of genes related to cell movement and transport. In H1X-depleted cells, the promoters of up-regulated genes are not occupied specifically by this variant, have a lower than average H1 content, and, unexpectedly, do not form an H1 valley upon induction.

https://openalex.org/W2042910170,"Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) is the largest and most heterogeneous AML subgroup. It lacks sensitive and specific biomarkers. Emerging evidences have suggested that microRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of various leukemias. This paper evaluated the association between microRNA expression and prognostic outcome for CN-AML, based on the RNA/microRNA sequencing data of CN-AML patients. High let-7a-2-3p expression and low miR-188-5p expression were identified to be significantly associated with longer overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) for CN-AML, independently or in a combined way. Their prognostic values were further confirmed in European Leukemia Net (ELN) genetic categories. Also, in multivariable analysis with other known risk factors, high let-7a-2-3p and low miR-188-5p expression remained to be associated with longer OS and EFS. In addition, the prognostic value of these two microRNAs was confirmed in patients who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). To gain more biological insights of the underlying mechanisms, we derived the genome-wide differential gene/microRNA signatures associated with the expression of let-7a-2-3p and miR-188-5p. Several common microRNA signatures indicating favorable outcome in previous studies were up-regulated in both high let-7a-2-3p expressers and low miR-188-5p expressers, including miR-135a, miR-335 and miR-125b and all members of miR-181 family. Additionally, common up-regulated genes included FOSB, IGJ, SNORD50A and ZNF502, and FOSB was a known favorable signature in AML. These common signatures further confirmed the underlying common mechanisms for these two microRNAs value as favorable prognostic biomarkers. We concluded that high let-7a-2-3p and low miR-188-5p expression could be potentially used as favorably prognostic biomarkers independently or in a combined way in CN-AML patients, whether they received HSCT or not."

Three studies examined whether potentially threatening scientific findings motivate group members to take action against the respective findings by publicly discrediting them on the Web. Results show that strongly (vs. weakly) identified group members (i.e., people who identified as ""gamers"") were particularly likely to discredit social identity threatening findings publicly (i.e., studies that found an effect of playing violent video games on aggression). A content analytical evaluation of online comments revealed that social identification specifically predicted critiques of the methodology employed in potentially threatening, but not in non-threatening research (Study 2). Furthermore, when participants were collectively (vs. self-) affirmed, identification did no longer predict discrediting posting behavior (Study 3). These findings contribute to the understanding of the formation of online collective action and add to the burgeoning literature on the question why certain scientific findings sometimes face a broad public opposition."

Mutations in LEPREL1, the gene encoding prolyl 3-hydroxylase-2 (P3H2), have recently been identified in individuals with recessively inherited nonsyndromic severe myopia. P3H2 is a member of a family of genes that includes three isoenzymes of prolyl 3-hydroxylase (P3H), P3H1, P3H2, and P3H3. Fundamentally, it is understood that P3H1 is responsible for converting proline to 3-hydroxyproline. This limited additional knowledge also suggests that each isoenzyme has evolved different collagen sequence-preferred substrate specificities. In this study, differences in prolyl 3-hydroxylation were screened in eye tissues from P3h2-null (P3h2n/n) and wild-type mice to seek tissue-specific effects due the lack of P3H2 activity on post-translational collagen chemistry that could explain myopia. The mice were viable and had no gross musculoskeletal phenotypes.

The level of prolyl 3-hydroxylation at multiple substrate sites from type I collagen chains was high in sclera, similar to tendon. Almost every known site of prolyl 3-hydroxylation in types I and IV collagen from P3h2n/n mouse eye tissues was significantly under-hydroxylated compared with their wild-type littermates.

This modification has been shown to add structural stability to the collagen triple helix through hydrogen bonding (1.Berg R.A. Prockop D.J.

However, P3H1 is one of a family of genes that includes three isoenzymes, P3H1 (LEPRE1), P3H2 (LEPREL1), and P3H3 (LEPREL2) (15.Järnum S. Kjellman C. Darabi A. Nilsson I. Edvardsen K. Aman P.

It is believed these isoenzymes have evolved differences in their preferred collagen substrate and tissue specificities (16.Fernandes R.J. Farnand A.W. Traeger G.R. Weis M.A. Eyre D.R.

These data suggest that loss of function of P3H2 in humans produces a highly selective and tissue-specific phenotype. 3S,2S-l-hydroxyproline prolyl 3-hydroxylase 4R,2S-l-hydroxyproline European conditional mouse mutagenesis. Myopia, a condition believed to result from an increase in the axial diameter of the eye, is the leading cause of visual impairment worldwide (19.Hornbeak D.M. Young T.L. Myopia genetics: a review of current research and emerging trends.Curr. Opin. Ophthalmol. 2009; 20: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). High myopia is quantitatively defined as having an optical power of ≥ −6 diopters and an eye diameter of ≥26 mm (20.Young T.L. Ronan S.M. Drahozal L.A. Wildenberg S.C. Alvear A.B. Oetting W.S.

Genet. 1998; 63: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The cause of increased eye length is not fully understood but is believed to be associated with altered tissue properties in the eye. Indeed, the mechanical properties of scleral tissue were shown to be significantly altered in a myopic animal model (21.Phillips J.R. McBrien N.A. Form deprivation myopia: elastic properties of sclera.Ophthalmic Physiol. Opt. 1995; 15: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Sclera is a unique structural tissue that can regulate physiological eye distortions that occur during eye movement and intraocular pressure changes (22.McBrien N.A. Jobling A.I. Gentle A. Biomechanics of the sclera in myopia: extracellular and cellular factors.Optom. Vis. Sci. 2009; 86: E23-E30Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In a myopic animal model, the scleral walls were observed to thin and weaken, which resulted in the inability to accommodate normal intraocular pressure fluctuations (23.McBrien N.A. Cornell L.M. Gentle A. Structural and ultrastructural changes to the sclera in a mammalian model of high myopia.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2179-2187PubMed Google Scholar). Several syndromic forms of high myopia exist, including Stickler syndrome, Marshall syndrome, and Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome, which also present clinically with other connective tissue disorders and deafness. These conditions are all caused by mutations in Col2A1 and/or Col11A1. Interestingly, until quite recently very few cases of severe nonsyndromic myopias have been identified (24.Guo H. Jin X. Zhu T.

A recent report by Pokidysheva et al. (28.Pokidysheva E. Boudko S. Vranka J. Zientek K. Maddox K. Moser M. Fässler R. Ware J. Bächinger H.P. Biological role of prolyl 3-hydroxylation in type IV collagen.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) suggested that loss of P3h2 in mice may be associated with embryonic lethality. In this study, a new line of P3h2-null (P3h2n/n) mice was generated to address the apparent divergent observations between the Pokidysheva mouse model and the reported human cases of LEPREL1-associated high myopia (17.Guo H. Tong P. Peng Y. Wang T. Liu Y. Chen J. Li Y. Tian Q. Hu Y. Zheng Y. Xiao L. Xiong W. Pan Q. Hu Z. Xia K.

Genet. 2011; 89: 438-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The biochemical phenotype of the P3h2n/n mice from this study was characterized as a model to help study potential pathomechanisms leading to human high myopia. The P3h2n/n mice were viable and morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. Collagens were solubilized from the lens capsule, sclera, cornea, and vitreous and screened for prolyl 3-hydroxylation abnormalities. We hypothesize that loss of P3h2 results in altered collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation, which cause structural abnormalities in eye tissues that drive early onset and progressive myopia. Embryonic stem cells were obtained from the European conditional mouse mutagenesis (EUCOMM) resource and injected in-house to generate the knock-out allele mice (P3h2+/−). Briefly, a floxed allele mouse (P3h2c/+) was generated by removing a lacZ expression cassette, using Rosa26-Flipase mice (Fig. 1A). The null allele mouse (P3h2n/+) was also generated by removing exon 3 using the CMV-Cre mouse line. Mice were maintained on a C57/BL6J background and were housed at the Baylor College of Medicine vivarium. Genotyping was performed using primers flanking exon 3 for the wild-type allele (5′-CTTTTGACTCCCTCTCCCC-3′) and (5′-GCTTTACCTGCGATTGCCTC-3′). The mutant allele was identified by primers in the Bactin/neo cassette (5′-GCACAGAGCCTCGCCTTTG-3′) and (5′-TCATTCAGGGCACCGGACAG-3′) as well as primers specific for the last loxP site (5′-CGATACCACGATATCAACAAG-3′) and (5′-CCTGGGCAACTTAGTGGAG-3′). Whole mouse kidneys were homogenized in RIPA buffer containing inhibitors (complete inhibitor with PMSF, Roche Applied Science). The supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was measured using a Bio-Rad Bradford assay kit. Total protein was resolved on a 4–15% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and transblotted to a PVDF membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA, probed with Leprel1 polyclonal antibody (1:500 dilution, ProteinTech), and detected with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000, anti-rabbit). Blots were developed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific) and exposed on autoradiography film. The EUCOMM allele contains a splice acceptor with a β-galactosidase cassette (Fig. 1A), allowing for expression characterization of P3h2 by β-galactosidase staining. Homozygous mice and their wild-type littermates were collected after timed mating at P0. Samples were then fixed for 2 h in 4.0% paraformaldehyde. For whole-mount studies, the samples were then rinsed in PBS and stained in X-Gal buffer for 24 h (2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 1 mg/ml X-Gal in 1× PBS). Samples were washed in PBS, fixed in formalin, rinsed, and then stored and imaged in 50% glycerol/PBS. For sectioned samples, fixed samples were rinsed in PBS, soaked in 30% sucrose overnight, and then embedded in OCT media. Frozen sections were collected at 12 μm thickness and stored at −80 °C. Slides were then fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Samples were washed three times for 5 min at room temperature in 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and PBS. Slides were stained overnight at 37 °C in staining solution (above) in the dark. Slides were rinsed with PBS and then with water, and counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red for 2 min. They were washed three times in water, dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylenes, and then mounted. Slides were imaged using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope. Bovine tissues were purchased from Sierra for Medical Science (Whittier, CA). Bovine (18 months) and mouse (9 months) eye tissues were isolated using a dissecting microscope. Mouse eyes were prepared using a dissecting microscope. Cornea (transparent anterior region) and sclera (opaque posterior region) were easily distinguished using this approach. Vitreous (transparent inner gel) was collected upon the initial excision in the eye. The lens capsule collagen was directly isolated from the crystalline lens by pepsin digestion of the whole lens. Type I collagen was solubilized from tendon, sclera, and cornea by heat denaturation for 5 min at 100 °C in Laemmli buffer (SDS extraction), 3% acetic acid at 4 °C for 24 h, or cyanogen bromide digestion in 70% formic acid at room temperature for 24 h (5.Weis M.A. Hudson D.M.

Type II (vitreous) and type IV (lens capsule) collagen α-chains were solubilized by pepsin digestion or cyanogen bromide digestion as described previously (7.Risteli J. Bächinger H.P. Engel J.

Collagen α-chains were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (Sigma). Bovine sclera and cornea were isolated and collagenase-digested as described previously (29.Hanson D.A.

Total collagenase digests were resolved into peptide fractions on a C8 column by reverse-phase HPLC and monitored at 220 nm. Mass spectrometric analysis of 3Hyp content within collagen α-chains was performed as described previously (5.Weis M.A. Hudson D.M. Kim L. Scott M. Wu J.J. Eyre D.R.

Electrospray mass spectrometry was carried out on the tryptic peptides using an LTQ XL linear quadrupole ion-trap mass spectrometer equipped with in-line Accela 1250 liquid chromatography and automated sample injection (ThermoFisher Scientific). Proteome Discoverer software (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used for peptide identification. Tryptic peptides were also identified manually by calculating the possible MS/MS ions and matching these to the actual MS/MS spectrum using Thermo Xcalibur software. Hydroxyl differences were determined manually by averaging the full scan MS over several minutes to include all the post-translational variations of a given peptide. Protein sequences used for MS analysis were obtained from the Ensembl genome database. Mass spectral quantitation of 3Hyp residues was based on 16-Da mass increases at known sites of prolyl 3-hydroxylation at the Xaa position of Gly-Xaa-4Hyp sequences previously confirmed by Edman degradation (5.Weis M.A. Hudson D.M.

The P3h2n/n mice were viable and indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates by gross physical appearance at birth (Fig. 1B). Micro-computed tomography analysis showed similar skeletal phenotypes for the P3h2n/n and control littermates (data not shown). The β-gal cassette in the knock-out mouse construct serves to replace the Leprel1 transcript with β-galactosidase in a targeted manner (Fig. 1A). Therefore, in the knock-out mice positive β-galactosidase staining will identify those tissues that normally express P3h2. Staining for β-galactosidase activity was performed in both whole-mount and sectioned kidney samples at P0 from knock-out mice using wild-type littermates that lack the β-galactosidase cassette as controls. In whole-mount animals, β-galactosidase staining for P3h2 was found in prehypertrophic regions of long bone throughout the whole animal (Fig. 1B). In kidney sections, P3h2 expression was localized to the glomeruli as determined by β-galactosidase staining (Fig. 1C). Immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal Leprel1 antibody against total renal protein extracts showed the absence of protein expression in the P3h2n/n mice (Fig. 1D). The expression pattern of P3h2 generated from this approach correlated with multiple previously reported expression analysis studies (15.Järnum S. Kjellman C. Darabi A. Nilsson I. Edvardsen K.

P3h2-positive β-galactosidase staining was localized to the cornea and sclera of 2-month-old mice (Fig. 2A). At higher magnification (×40), the β-galactosidase staining was observed to be specific to the outer basement membrane-lined epithelial layer of the cornea (Fig. 2B). No P3h2 expression was evident in the corneal stroma, which is primarily extracellular matrix-rich in types I and V collagens (Fig. 2B). At the posterior region of the eye, a weak staining signal appeared to be specific to the sclera, which also has primarily a type I collagen-based matrix (Fig. 2C). Sclera, lens capsule, and vitreous collagens were selected as collagen sources to analyze for potential P3h2 sites. Type I collagen was extracted from mouse scleral tissue by SDS extraction or pepsin extraction and digested in-gel with trypsin. Mass spectral analysis of peptides containing the wild-type mouse scleral α1(I)Pro-986 and α2(I)Pro-707 sites revealed prolyl 3-hydroxylation levels similar to those from mouse tail tendon (Table 1) (34.Pokidysheva E.

https://openalex.org/W2113050875,"Cotton (Gossypium spp.) fibers are single-cell trichomes that arise from the outer epidermal layer of seed coat. Here, we isolated a R3-MYB gene GhCPC, identified by cDNA microarray analysis. The only conserved R3 motif and different expression between TM-1 and fuzzless-lintless mutants suggested that it might be a negative regulator in fiber development. Transgenic evidence showed that GhCPC overexpression not only delayed fiber initiation but also led to significant decreases in fiber length. Interestingly, Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed an interaction complex, in which GhCPC and GhTTG1/4 separately interacted with GhMYC1. In transgenic plants, Q-PCR analysis showed that GhHOX3 (GL2) and GhRDL1 were significantly down regulated in −1–5 DPA ovules and fibers. In addition, Yeast one-hybrid analysis demonstrated that GhMYC1 could bind to the E-box cis-elements and the promoter of GhHOX3. These results suggested that GhHOX3 (GL2) might be downstream gene of the regulatory complex. Also, overexpression of GhCPC in tobacco led to differential loss of pigmentation. Taken together, the results suggested that GhCPC might negatively regulate cotton fiber initiation and early elongation by a potential CPC-MYC1-TTG1/4 complex. Although the fibers were shorter in transgenic cotton lines than in the wild type, no significant difference was detected in stem or leaf trichomes, even in cotton mutants (five naked seed or fuzzless), suggesting that fiber and trichome development might be regulated by two sets of genes sharing a similar model."
https://openalex.org/W1991875400,"Background Goblet cell hyperplasia is a classic but variable pathologic finding in COPD. Current literature shows that smoking is a risk factor for chronic bronchitis but the relationship of these clinical features to the presence and magnitude of large airway goblet cell hyperplasia has not been well described. We hypothesized that current smokers and chronic bronchitics would have more goblet cells than nonsmokers or those without chronic bronchitis (CB), independent of airflow obstruction. Methods We recruited 15 subjects with moderate to severe COPD, 12 healthy smokers, and 11 healthy nonsmokers. Six endobronchial mucosal biopsies per subject were obtained by bronchoscopy and stained with periodic acid Schiff-Alcian Blue. Goblet cell density (GCD) was quantified as goblet cell number per millimeter of basement membrane. Mucin volume density (MVD) was quantified as volume of mucin per unit area of basement membrane. Results Healthy smokers had a greater GCD and MVD than nonsmokers and COPD subjects. COPD subjects had a greater GCD than nonsmokers. When current smokers (healthy smokers and COPD current smokers, n = 19) were compared with all nonsmokers (nonsmoking controls and COPD ex-smokers, n = 19), current smokers had a greater GCD and MVD. When those with CB (n = 12) were compared to those without CB (n = 26), the CB group had greater GCD. This finding was also seen in those with CB in the COPD group alone. In multivariate analysis, current smoking and CB were significant predictors of GCD using demographics, lung function, and smoking pack years as covariates. All other covariates were not significant predictors of GCD or MVD. Conclusions Current smoking is associated with a more goblet cell hyperplasia and number, and CB is associated with more goblet cells, independent of the presence of airflow obstruction. This provides clinical and pathologic correlation for smokers with and without COPD."

Here we present three siblings with ASD where we evaluated the usefulness of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) for the diagnostic approach to ASD. Methods We identified a family segregating ASD in three siblings with an unidentified cause. We performed WGS in the three probands and used a state-of-the-art comprehensive bioinformatic analysis pipeline and prioritized the identified variants located in genes likely to be related to ASD. We validated the finding by Sanger sequencing in the probands and their parents. Results Three male siblings presented a syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability, absence of language, autism spectrum symptoms and epilepsy with negative family history for mental retardation, language disorders, ASD or other psychiatric disorders. We found germline mosaicism for a heterozygous deletion of a cytosine in the exon 21 of the SHANK3 gene, resulting in a missense sequence of 5 codons followed by a premature stop codon (NM_033517:c.3259_3259delC, p.Ser1088Profs*6). Conclusions We reported an infrequent form of familial ASD where WGS proved useful in the clinic. We identified a mutation in SHANK3 that underscores its relevance in Autism Spectrum Disorder."

To follow the kinetics of induction and involution of mitochondria, we determined the expression pattern of UCP1 and other mitochondrial proteins as well as analyzed mtDNA content after cold stimulation and reacclimation to thermoneutrality. We showed that UCP1 turnover is very different in iBAT and inguinal WAT (ingWAT); the former showed minimal changes in protein content, whereas the latter showed major changes. Similarly, in iBAT both mtDNA content and the expression of mitochondrial proteins were stable and expressed at similar levels during reversible transitions from 29 °C to 4 °C, whereas ingWAT revealed dynamic changes. Further analysis showed that in iBAT, the expression patterns for UCP1 and other mitochondrial proteins resembled each other, whereas in ingWAT, UCP1 varied ∼100-fold during the transition from cold to warmth, and no other mitochondrial proteins matched UCP1. In turn, quantitative analysis of thermogenic capacity determined by estimating the proportion of UCP1 to respiratory complex components showed no significant differences between brown and brite adipocytes, suggesting similar thermogenic potentiality. Our results indicate that dynamics of brown adipocytes turnover during reversible transition from warm to cold may determine the thermogenic capacity of an individual in a changing temperature environment.

An allelic form of mouse mortalin (mot-1) that differs by two amino acids, M618V and G624R, in the C terminus substrate-binding domain has been reported. Furthermore, genome sequencing of mortalin from Parkinson disease patients identified two missense mutants, R126W and P509S. In the present study, we investigated the significance of these mutations in survival, proliferation, and oxidative stress tolerance in human cells. Using mot-1 and mot-2 recombinant proteins and specific antibodies, we performed screening to find their binding proteins and then identified ribosomal protein L-7 (RPL-7) and elongation factor-1 α (EF-1α), which differentially bind to mot-1 and mot-2, respectively. We demonstrate that mot-1, R126W, or P509S mutant (i) lacks mot-2 functions involved in carcinogenesis, such as p53 inactivation and hTERT/hnRNP-K (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K) activation; (ii) causes increased level of endogenous oxidative stress; (iii) results in decreased tolerance of cells to exogenous oxidative stress; and (iv) shows differential binding and impact on the RPL-7 and EF-1α proteins. These factors may mediate the transformation of longevity/pro-proliferative function of mot-2 to the premature aging/anti-proliferative effect of mutants, and hence may have significance in cellular aging, Parkinson disease pathology, and prognosis.

These factors may mediate the transformation of longevity/pro-proliferative function of mot-2 to the premature aging/anti-proliferative effect of mutants, and hence may have significance in cellular aging, Parkinson disease pathology, and prognosis. Aging is an innate multifactorial process that leads to functional deterioration of living systems over time and ends with death. The mortality of an organism is largely considered as an outcome of accumulation of structural and functional errors that gradually trigger senescence (1.Muñoz-Espín D. Serrano M. Cellular senescence: from physiology to pathology.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 482-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). Although the exact players that limit the lifespan of normal cells are not completely known, it is generally accepted that cellular aging or senescence is a signal transduction program that induces an irreversible growth arrest state in normal cells. Tumor suppressor pathways (p53 and/or retinoblastoma protein and their regulators, such as p16INK4a, p21WAF1, and p14ARF) have been established to play critical roles in cellular senescence (2.Hayflick L. Moorhead P.S. The serial cultivation of human diploid cell strains.Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 25: 585-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (5489) Google Scholar, 3.Campisi J.

What activates these gene functions is not fully understood. One likely candidate is DNA damage, particularly at chromosome ends, that is generated spontaneously with each cell division in the form of attrition of the telomeres (5.Hayflick L. How and why we age.Exp. Gerontol. 1998; 33: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6.Kaul Z. Cesare A.J. Huschtscha L.I. Neumann A.A. Reddel R.R. Five dysfunctional telomeres predict onset of senescence in human cells.EMBO Rep. 2012; 13: 52-59Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). DNA damage and oxidative stress-related signaling have recently been linked not only to cellular aging/replicative senescence but also to the age pathologies including Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases (7.von Zglinicki T.

The impact of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear genes related to mitochondrial functioning on the risk of Parkinson's disease.Curr. genomics. 2013; 14: 543-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Protein modifications, e.g. the oxidation, glycation, and deamidation of asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues, the formation of isopeptide bonds, and the accumulation of molecular damage, have been reported to contribute to cellular and organismal aging. Interestingly, tissue susceptibility to experimentally induced protein modification not only depends on tissue type and age, but also on the maximum lifespan potential of species (1.Muñoz-Espín D. Serrano M. Cellular senescence: from physiology to pathology.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 482-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar, 10.Sõti C. Sreedhar A.S. Csermely P. Apoptosis, necrosis and cellular senescence: chaperone occupancy as a potential switch.Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Accumulation of misfolded proteins is especially pronounced in aged cells. Hence they heavily depend on their innate “proteotoxic surveillance” provided by ubiquitous molecular chaperones, the heat shock proteins. Chaperones are necessary to regulate various cellular signaling processes and prevent deleterious age-associated accumulation of protein aggregates (11.Shibata Y. Morimoto R.I.

The stably infected cells were maintained in 100 μg/ml G418-supplemented medium. Escherichia coli M15 cells were transformed with the expression constructs pET16/mot-1 and pET16/mot-2 and cultured at 37 °C until A600 read 0.5–0.7. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cells were further cultured for 5 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in Buffer A (100 mm NaH2PO4; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0; 8 m urea; 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol; 15 mm imidazole). The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the soluble fraction was used for purification using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Ni-NTA-agarose) (Qiagen, Inc.). Lysate from the bacteria expressing mot-1 or mot-2 proteins was incubated with the beads placed in a column followed by washing three times with buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 5.9; 8 m urea; 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol; 0.1% Triton X-100). Recombinant mortalin proteins were eluted with the wash buffer followed by Buffer B (100 mm NaH2PO4; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 4.5; 8 m urea; 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The eluted proteins were dialyzed for 48 h against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8; 150 mm NaCl; and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol.

Cell proliferation was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Invitrogen) using 96-well plates (103 cells/well). For oxidative stress, cells were treated with 1.0 mm hydrogen peroxide (2 h) followed by recovery in the fresh medium (48–72 h). Cells were incubated with 100 μl of MTT solution (0.5 mg/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C. The solution was removed, and 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were added to each well. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm, using a microplate reader (Infinite 200 PRO; Tecan Group Ltd.). All assays were performed independently at least three times. Cells (1 × 103) were seeded on 6-well plates. Cells were maintained until the appearance of colonies with regular change of medium. Colonies were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.5% crystal violet, photographed, and counted. Cells were cultured on glass coverslips placed in 12-well plates and stained for reactive oxygen species (ROS) by fluorescent staining using the Image-iTTM LIVE Green ROS detection kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images were captured on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope and analyzed by AxioVision 4.6 software (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY).

The files were transferred to a graphic workstation and analyzed with Imaris software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland). Control, mot-1, and mot-2 cells (1 × 105/well) were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with 1 μg of pGL13-luc plasmid vector containing firefly luciferase gene- and p53-responsive elements. pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) vector was used as transfection efficiency control. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a microplate reader (Infinite 200 PRO; Tecan Group Ltd.). TRAP assay (for semiquantitative detection of telomerase activity) was performed using the TeloTAGGG telomerase PCR ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Cell lysates were prepared in lysis reagent from cultured (2 × 105) cells. The supernatant collected after centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C was used for TRAP assay. Telomerase activity in the sample was calculated as units of activity relative to the positive control. Heat-inactivated G361 lysate was used as negative control. All the assays were performed in triplicate. The data are expressed as a means ± S.E., and the significance of differences between groups was determined by the Mann-Whitney test (nonparametric rank sum test) using StatView software (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Retrovirus-mediated exogenous expression of Myc-tagged mot-1 (Val-618 and Arg-624) and mot-2 (Met-618 and Gly-624) in U2OS, G361, and IMR32 (human) and C6 (rat) cells revealed morphological differences. Although mot-2 derivatives appeared more rounded and smaller as compared with the control cells, the mot-1 derivatives showed elongated and flattened morphology (Fig. 1A and data not shown) in all these cell types. Cell proliferation/growth rate analyses showed that mot-1 and mot-2 derivatives divided more slowly and more quickly than the control cells, respectively (Fig. 1B). Long term colony-forming assays also revealed similar phenotype in all the cell lines. As compared with the control cells, mot-1 derivatives formed smaller and fewer colonies, and the mot-2 derivatives formed bigger and more colonies (Fig. 1C and data not shown). We isolated several mot-1 and mot-2 derivative clones of U2OS cells. The level of expression of mot-1 and mot-2 proteins was examined by Western blotting with anti-Myc and anti-mortalin antibodies. Cell proliferation assays of these clones revealed that although mot-2 accelerated the growth of parent U2OS cells, mot-1 caused their growth inhibition (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, dose-dependent inhibition of growth was observed in mot-1-transduced human lung fibroblasts (A549) and melanoma cells (G361) and rat glioblastoma (C6) cells (data not shown), demonstrating that the anti-proliferative effect of mot-1 was not cell line- or species-specific. mot-2 has been shown to cause pro-proliferative effect and malignant transformation of human cancer cells by inactivation of p53 functions, including transcriptional inactivation (34.Kaul S.C.

Most recently, we reported that the nuclear mot-2 activates telomerase and hnRNP-K and contributes to cancer aggressiveness (26.Ryu J. Kaul Z. Yoon A.R. Liu Y. Yaguchi T. Na Y. Ahn H.M. Gao R.

As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, immunolocalization of transfected mot-1 and mot-2 proteins by anti-Myc tag antibody revealed nuclear staining of mot-2/Myc; mot-1 was not found in the nucleus. Similar results were obtained in mot-1 and mot-2 derivatives of G361 and C6 cells (data not shown). We next examined the expression of p53 and its activity level in mot-1 and mot-2 derivatives of U2OS and G361 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, A–C, consistent with earlier studies, p53 protein as well as its transcriptional activation function decreased in mot-2-overexpressing cells. In contrast, there was no decrease in the level of p53 in mot-1 derivatives. Instead, increase in nuclear p53 and p53-dependent reporter assays was observed (Fig. 3, B and C). Investigation on the telomerase activity of mot-1 and mot-2 derivatives of G361 (telomerase plus cell line) by TRAP assay showed increase in mot-2 derivatives. Interestingly, mot-1 derivatives showed reduction in the telomerase activity (Fig. 3D). Immunocytochemical examination of hnRNP-K showed its nuclear enrichment only in the mot-2 derivatives (Fig. 3E). Most noticeably, mot-1 showed a high level of endogenous ROS (Fig. 3F) and was more sensitive to H2O2-induced stress as compared with the mot-2 derivative cells (Fig. 3G). Taken together, these data showed that mot-1 and mot-2 possess distinct activities, and these differences may mediate their contrasting effect on cell"

A general consensus on the most appropriate surgical technique has not yet been reached. The aim of this systematic review of the literature is to compare the two most commonly used transverse abdominal incisions for caesarean delivery, the Pfannenstiel incision and the modified Joel-Cohen incision, in terms of acute and chronic post-surgical pain and their subsequent influence in terms of quality of life. Electronic database searches formed the basis of the literature search and the following databases were searched in the time frame between January 1997 and December 2013: MEDLINE, EMBASE Sciencedirect and the Cochrane Library. Key search terms included: ""acute pain"", ""chronic pain"", ""Pfannenstiel incision"", ""Misgav-Ladach"", ""Joel Cohen incision"", in combination with ""Caesarean Section"", ""abdominal incision"", ""numbness"", ""neuropathic pain"" and ""nerve entrapment"". Data on 4771 patients who underwent caesarean section (CS) was collected with regards to the relation between surgical techniques and postoperative outcomes defined as acute or chronic pain and future pregnancy desire. The Misgav-Ladach incision was associated with a significant advantage in terms of reduction of post-surgical acute and chronic pain. It was indicated as the optimal technique in view of its characteristic of reducing lower pelvic discomfort and pain, thus improving quality of life and future fertility desire. Further studies which are not subject to important bias like pre-existing chronic pain, non-standardized analgesia administration, variable length of skin incision and previous abdominal surgery are required."
https://openalex.org/W1978916726,"Most flowering plants depend on pollinators to reproduce. Thus, evaluating the robustness of plant-pollinator assemblages to species loss is a major concern. How species interaction patterns are related to species sensitivity to partner loss may influence the robustness of plant-pollinator assemblages. In plants, both reproductive dependence on pollinators (breeding system) and dispersal ability may modulate plant sensitivity to pollinator loss. For instance, species with strong dependence (e.g. dioecious species) and low dispersal (e.g. seeds dispersed by gravity) may be the most sensitive to pollinator loss. We compared the interaction patterns of plants differing in dependence on pollinators and dispersal ability in a meta-dataset comprising 192 plant species from 13 plant-pollinator networks. In addition, network robustness was compared under different scenarios representing sequences of plant extinctions associated with plant sensitivity to pollinator loss. Species with different dependence on pollinators and dispersal ability showed similar levels of generalization. Although plants with low dispersal ability interacted with more generalized pollinators, low-dispersal plants with strong dependence on pollinators (i.e. the most sensitive to pollinator loss) interacted with more particular sets of pollinators (i.e. shared a low proportion of pollinators with other plants). Only two assemblages showed lower robustness under the scenario considering plant generalization, dependence on pollinators and dispersal ability than under the scenario where extinction sequences only depended on plant generalization (i.e. where higher generalization level was associated with lower probability of extinction). Overall, our results support the idea that species generalization and network topology may be good predictors of assemblage robustness to species loss, independently of plant dispersal ability and breeding system. In contrast, since ecological specialization among partners may increase the probability of disruption of interactions, the fact that the plants most sensitive to pollinator loss interacted with more particular pollinator assemblages suggest that the persistence of these plants and their pollinators might be highly compromised."
https://openalex.org/W2023739270,"Previously, we identified the N-terminal domain of transit peptides (TPs) as a major determinant for the translocation step in plastid protein import. Analysis of Arabidopsis TP dataset revealed that this domain has two overlapping characteristics, highly uncharged and Hsp70-interacting. To investigate these two properties, we replaced the N-terminal domains of the TP of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and its reverse peptide with a series of unrelated peptides whose affinities to the chloroplast stromal Hsp70 have been determined. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that eight out of nine peptides in this series are not similar to the TP N terminus. Using in vivo and in vitro protein import assays, the majority of the precursors containing Hsp70-binding elements were targeted to plastids, whereas none of the chimeric precursors lacking an N-terminal Hsp70-binding element were targeted to the plastids. Moreover, a pulse-chase assay showed that two chimeric precursors with the most uncharged peptides failed to translocate into the stroma. The ability of multiple unrelated Hsp70-binding elements to support protein import verified that the majority of TPs utilize an N-terminal Hsp70-binding domain during translocation and expand the mechanistic view of the import process.

Moreover, recent bioinformatic analysis has not been fruitful in identifying the consensus motifs within TPs (10.Lee D.W. Kim J.K. Lee S. Choi S. Kim S. Hwang I.

Despite the large number of TPs and short amino acid (aa) length, structural approaches have not provided much insight.

Nevertheless, three loosely defined regions in TPs have been identified as follows: (i) N-ter of ∼10 uncharged aa ending with Pro/Gly and preferably Ala as the second aa, (ii) central domain lacking acidic aa but rich in hydroxylated aa, and (iii) C-ter rich in Arg and possibly forming an amphiphilic β-strand (5.Bruce B.D.

These studies have proposed that the TP N-ter of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (SSU) and ferredoxin (FD) directs precursor binding during the import process by interacting with the envelope lipids or the Toc159 receptor. However, we generated synthetic TPs lacking the uncharged N-ter but still able to bind to plastids, similar to the wild-type TPs. These synthetic TPs of SSU (SStp) and FD (FDtp) contain the reversed aa sequences from C- to N-ter. Together with a series of their N-ter mutants, these constructs have confirmed the TP N-ter as an essential determinant for protein translocation into plastid stroma (21.Chotewutmontri P.

In addition to the uncharged properties, the TP N-ter has been shown to harbor a strong Hsp70-binding site (H70BS) (22.Ivey 3rd, R.A. Subramanian C. Bruce B.D.

Cline K. Protein import and routing systems of chloroplasts.Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To further address these two N-ter properties, we have constructed new TPs based on the forward (native) and reverse constructs of SStp that are called SSF and SSR, respectively. The N-ter of these constructs was extended to include peptide sequences derived from a comprehensive study of 36 peptides where their affinities for multiple Hsp70s have been determined (31.Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Common and divergent peptide binding specificities of hsp70 molecular chaperones.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nine peptides were selected that are strongly interacting with all chaperones to noninteracting with any of them. We further determined the relative affinity of these peptides to the chloroplast Hsp70 CSS1. The effect of the N-ter alteration in preprotein import was assessed by in vivo and in vitro import assays. In addition, the recognition of physicochemical properties was further elucidated by reversing and scrambling the N-ter 10 aa. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the addition of a short, non-native, Hsp70-interacting domain that even includes charged residues at the N-ter of a TP can support preprotein translocation into plastids in vivo and in vitro. This work indicated that the majority of TPs utilize an Hsp70-binding N-ter during translocation and opens the way for synthetic biology to create de novo TPs that exceed the targeting activity of natural TPs. The N-ter mutants were generated based on two previously generated constructs, pBS-SSR10-MtoA-SSF-YFP and pBS-SSF10-MtoA-SSR-YFP (21.Chotewutmontri P. Reddick L.E. McWilliams D.R. Campbell I.M.

The DNA sequences of nine peptides, pp38, pp9, PepG, V10, A6R, HbS, np09, DRC8, and HA, were added on the PCR primers to replace SSR10 and SSF10. The reversed and scrambled N-ter mutants were produced similarly to replace the N-ter of SSF and FDF in pBS-SSF-YFP and pBS-FDF-YFP (21.Chotewutmontri P. Reddick L.E. McWilliams D.R. Campbell I.M.

The TP-YFP fusion proteins and m20-YFPHis6 control were produced from pET constructs using TnT T7 Coupled Wheat Germ Extract System (Promega, Madison, WI) with 0.8 μCi/μl [35S]methionine (MP Biomedical). Two batches of translation were used. The translation products were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by digital autoradiography using Storage Phosphor Screen (Molecular Dynamics) or Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad) and quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The relative concentration of each protein was determined from the radioactivity and the numbers of Met. The concentrations were equalized by adding 50% TnT Wheat Germ Extract (Promega). An equal volume of equalized proteins was used in the import assay. The chloroplasts were isolated from 12- to 14-day-old seedlings of dwarf pea (Pisum sativum) cultivar Green Arrow as described previously (33.Reddick L.E. Chotewutmontri P. Crenshaw W. Dave A.

Briefly, the assays were performed in a 500-μl reaction containing 0.25 mg of chlorophyll/ml chloroplasts, labeled protein, 2 mm l-Met, 10 mm DTT, 2 mm Mg-ATP, 0.5% BSA, 300 mm urea, 330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0. The reactions were incubated at room temperature. A 150-μl sample was taken at 5, 10, and 15 min after the reaction was started and mixed with 600 μl of ice-cold buffer (330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0). The chloroplasts were re-isolated and separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and quantified by digital autoradiography. Two sets of independent assays were performed. The amount of imported proteins was normalized where the amount of mature domain of the SSF construct at 15 min was assigned as 100% for the SSF mutant series and the m20-YFPHis6 control. The amount of mature domain of FDF at 15 min was assigned as 100% for the FDF mutant series. The relative import rate of each time point was calculated from the relative amount of the mature proteins at that time point divided by the import time. The fastest rate among the three time points was assigned as the maximum import rate. To avoid multiple products presented in the in vitro translation of TP-YFP constructs, we chose to use the construct containing TP followed by mSSU with C-ter 3×HA and His6 tags. The precursor of SSU from pET-11 vector (35.Klein R.R. Salvucci M.E.

The C-ter tag was added by PCR. Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table S1. The mSSU-3×HA-His6 region was subcloned into the pET constructs containing TP-YFP fusion producing TP-mSSU-3×HA-His6 constructs. The 35S-labeled precursors were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously (33.Reddick L.E. Chotewutmontri P. Crenshaw W. Dave A. Vaughn M. Bruce B.D.

The plants were kept in the dark for at least 14 h to deplete ATP, and all procedures were performed under dim light to prevent ATP synthesis. The precursors were incubated with isolated chloroplasts in the presence of 0.1 mm ATP in the buffer containing 10 mm DTT, 4 mm MgCl2, 1% BSA, 300 mm urea, 330 mm sorbitol, and 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, at room temperature for 20 min. In this condition (pulse), the precursors are bound to the TOC/TIC translocons as the import intermediate (21.Chotewutmontri P. Reddick L.E. McWilliams D.R. Campbell I.M. Bruce B.D.

To initiate the translocation (chase), the re-isolated chloroplasts were suspended into the same buffer with the presence of 2 mm ATP and incubated at room temperature. Samples were taken at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 20 min and rapidly diluted with 3 volumes of ice-cold buffer (330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0) to stop the import. The chloroplasts were re-isolated, and a fraction was used to determine total protein concentration using BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal amounts of proteins were separated on a 10–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and quantified by autoradiography. Two sets of independent assays were performed. To express the mature domain of CSS1 precursor protein (mCSS1; residues 66–706) in E. coli, the mCSS1 cDNA was amplified together with the N-ter His6 tag and cloned into pET-30a generating pET-His-mCSS1. The rare Leu codon CTC in residues 167, 270, 373 and 652 was mutated to a CTG codon using QuikChange Lightning multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) generating pET-His-mCSS1-mut. All primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. The His-mCSS1 was expressed using E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) (EMD Millipore), purified using PrepEase-high specificity kit (Affymetrix), and dialyzed into Buffer M (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate). The substrate was produced from bovine α-lactalbumin (Sigma). The reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin (RCMLA) was made based on the published method (37.Bösl B. Grimminger V. Walter S.

To produce fluorescein-labeled RCMLA (F-RCMLA), the protein was dialyzed into 50 mm borate buffer, pH 8.50. NHS-fluorescein (Thermo Scientific) was added at 25-fold molar excess and incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. F-RCMLA was then separated using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) into 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.40, and finally dialyzed into Buffer M. The SSF peptide was expressed and purified as reported previously (21.Chotewutmontri P. Reddick L.E. McWilliams D.R. Campbell I.M. Bruce B.D.

The N-ter peptide competitors were synthesized and modified with N-ter acetylation and the C-ter amidation by New England Peptide, Inc. All peptides are 15 aa in length containing the Hsp70-binding domain (Fig. 2A) and part of SSR sequence similar to the first 15 aa of the N-ter mutant constructs based on SSR (Fig. 2D). These synthetic peptides were solubilized in DMSO before diluting with Buffer M containing 8 m urea to the final concentration of DMSO at 5%. The competitive binding assays were performed in a 40-μl reaction containing varying concentrations of SSF or 40 μm of the N-ter peptide, 10 μm His-mCSS1, 1 μm F-RCMLA, 2 mm ADP, 250 mm urea, 1.25% DMSO in Buffer M. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before separation using native PAGE. The gel with 6% acrylamide was used in 0.5× TBE buffer (44.5 mm Tris borate, pH 8.30, 1 mm EDTA). To increase detection sensitivity, the proteins in the gel were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The fluorescent signal was detected with Bioimaging Systems (UVP) equipped with 302 nm UV light source and SYBR Green emission filter. The image was captured using LabWorks software (UVP), and the quantitation of band intensity was performed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The saturated sinapinic acid matrix in 33% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was mixed with equal volume of protein sample. The mixture was spotted onto the stainless steel target plate and dried. MALDI-TOF MS was performed on a Bruker Daltonics Microflex mass spectrometer with positive ion mode.

https://openalex.org/W1964919947,"Left-right symmetrical distal limb conformation can be an important prerequisite for a successful performance, and it is often hypothesized that asymmetric or uneven feet are important enhancing factors for the development of lameness. On a population level, it has been demonstrated that uneven footed horses are retiring earlier from elite level competition, but the biomechanical consequences are not yet known. The objectives of this study were to compare the functional locomotor asymmetries of horses with uneven to those with even feet. Hoof kinetics and distal limb kinematics were collected from horses (n = 34) at trot. Dorsal hoof wall angle was used to classify horses as even or uneven (<1.5 and >1.5° difference between forefeet respectively) and individual feet as flat (<50°), medium (between 50° and 55°) or upright (>55°). Functional kinetic parameters were compared between even and uneven forefeet using MANOVA followed by ANOVA. The relative influences of differences in hoof angle between the forefeet and of absolute hoof angle on functional parameters were analysed using multiple regression analysis (P<0.05). In horses with uneven feet, the side with the flatter foot showed a significantly larger maximal horizontal braking and vertical ground reaction force, a larger vertical fetlock displacement and a suppler fetlock spring. The foot with a steeper hoof angle was linearly correlated with an earlier braking-propulsion transition. The conformational differences between both forefeet were more important for loading characteristics than the individual foot conformation of each individual horse. The differences in vertical force and braking force between uneven forefeet could imply either an asymmetrical loading pattern without a pathological component or a subclinical lameness as a result of a pathological development in the steeper foot."
https://openalex.org/W1969075854,"ATP-gated P2X7 receptors are prominently expressed in inflammatory cells and play a key role in the immune response. A major consequence of receptor activation is the regulated influx of Ca2+ through the self-contained cation non-selective channel. Although the physiological importance of the resulting rise in intracellular Ca2+ is universally acknowledged, the biophysics of the Ca2+ flux responsible for the effects are poorly understood, largely because traditional methods of measuring Ca2+ permeability are difficult to apply to P2X7 receptors. Here we use an alternative approach, called dye-overload patch-clamp photometry, to quantify the agonist-gated Ca2+ flux of recombinant P2X7 receptors of dog, guinea pig, human, monkey, mouse, rat, and zebrafish. We find that the magnitude of the Ca2+ component of the ATP-gated current depends on the species of origin, the splice variant, and the concentration of the purinergic agonist. We also measured a significant contribution of Ca2+ to the agonist-gated current of the native P2X7Rs of mouse and human immune cells. Our results provide cross-species quantitative measures of the Ca2+ current of the P2X7 receptor for the first time, and suggest that the cytoplasmic N terminus plays a meaningful role in regulating the flow of Ca2+ through the channel."
https://openalex.org/W1970521920,"Late leaf spot is a serious disease of peanut caused by the imperfect fungus, Phaeoisariopsis personata. Wild diploid species, Arachis diogoi. is reported to be highly resistant to this disease and asymptomatic. The objective of this study is to investigate the molecular responses of the wild peanut challenged with the late leaf spot pathogen using cDNA-AFLP and 2D proteomic study. A total of 233 reliable, differentially expressed genes were identified in Arachis diogoi. About one third of the TDFs exhibit no significant similarity with the known sequences in the data bases. Expressed sequence tag data showed that the characterized genes are involved in conferring resistance in the wild peanut to the pathogen challenge. Several genes for proteins involved in cell wall strengthening, hypersensitive cell death and resistance related proteins have been identified. Genes identified for other proteins appear to function in metabolism, signal transduction and defence. Nineteen TDFs based on the homology analysis of genes associated with defence, signal transduction and metabolism were further validated by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses in resistant wild species in comparison with a susceptible peanut genotype in time course experiments. The proteins corresponding to six TDFs were differentially expressed at protein level also. Differentially expressed TDFs and proteins in wild peanut indicate its defence mechanism upon pathogen challenge and provide initial breakthrough of genes possibly involved in recognition events and early signalling responses to combat the pathogen through subsequent development of resistivity. This is the first attempt to elucidate the molecular basis of the response of the resistant genotype to the late leaf spot pathogen, and its defence mechanism."

Methods The study was based on data obtained in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2010 to 2011. Education level and household income were used as indicators for SES. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate SES and other demographic variables as related factors for influenza vaccination, the primary outcome. Results Higher household income was positively associated with higher vaccine uptake in the younger (19–49 years) group [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08–2.23], whereas the low-income and low-education group had increased vaccination coverage than the middle-income and middle-education group in the older (≥ 50 years) group (aOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09–1.69). Current smokers tend to be unvaccinated in all age groups. Among individuals aged ≥ 50, older age, mild to moderate alcohol consumption, regular exercise, and having co-morbidities were positively associated with vaccination, while those who self-reported their health status as good were less likely to be vaccinated. Conclusions The relationship between SES and seasonal influenza vaccination coverage differed between the age groups throughout the adult South Korean population. Public health policies need to address these inequalities."
https://openalex.org/W2108107722,"Insulin resistance is an important contributing factor in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. AKT and mTORC1 are key components of the insulin pathway, and play a role in promoting de novo lipogenesis. However, mTORC1 hyperactivity per se does not induce steatosis in mouse livers, but instead, protects against high-fat diet induced steatosis. Here, we investigate the in vivo mechanism of steatosis-resistance secondary to mTORC1 activation, with emphasis on the role of S6K1-mediated feedback inhibition of AKT. Mice with single or double deletion of Tsc1 and/or S6k1 in a liver-specific or whole-body manner were generated to study glucose and hepatic lipid metabolism between the ages of 6–14 weeks. Following 8 weeks of high-fat diet, the Tsc1-/-;S6k1-/- mice had lower body weights but higher liver TG levels compared to that of the Tsc1-/- mice. However, the loss of S6k1 did not relieve feedback inhibition of Akt activity in the Tsc1-/- livers. To overcome Akt suppression, Pten was deleted in Tsc1-/- livers, and the resultant mice showed improved glucose tolerance compared with the Tsc1-/- mice. However, liver TG levels were significantly reduced in the Tsc1-/-;Pten-/- mice compared to the Pten-/- mice, which was restored with rapamycin. We found no correlation between liver TG and serum NEFA levels. Expression of lipogenic genes (Srebp1c, Fasn) were elevated in the Tsc1-/-;Pten-/- livers, but this was counter-balanced by an up-regulation of Cpt1a involved in fatty acid oxidation and the anti-oxidant protein, Nrf2. In summary, our in vivo models showed that mTORC1-induced resistance to steatosis was dependent on S6K1 activity, but not secondary to AKT suppression. These findings confirm that AKT and mTORC1 have opposing effects on hepatic lipid metabolism in vivo."

The formation of neovasculature with functionally defective blood vessels significantly impacts tumor progression, metastasis, and the efficacy of anticancer therapies. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) potently induces vascular permeability and vessel growth in the tumor microenvironment, and its inhibition normalizes tumor vasculature. In contrast, the signaling of the small GTPase R-Ras inhibits excessive angiogenic growth and promotes the maturation of regenerating blood vessels. R-Ras signaling counteracts VEGF-induced vessel sprouting, permeability, and invasive activities of endothelial cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of R-Ras on VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) activation by VEGF, the key mechanism for angiogenic stimulation. We show that tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR2 is significantly elevated in the tumor vasculature and dermal microvessels of VEGF-injected skin in R-Ras knockout mice. In cultured endothelial cells, R-Ras suppressed the internalization of VEGFR2, which is required for full activation of the receptor by VEGF. Consequently, R-Ras strongly suppressed autophosphorylation of the receptor at all five major tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Conversely, silencing of R-Ras resulted in increased VEGFR2 phosphorylation. This effect of R-Ras on VEGFR2 was, at least in part, dependent on vascular endothelial cadherin. These findings identify a novel function of R-Ras to control the response of endothelial cells to VEGF and suggest an underlying mechanism by which R-Ras regulates angiogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2048006439,"Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a highly conserved cellular recycling process involved in degradation of eukaryotic cellular components. During autophagy, macromolecules and organelles are sequestered into the double-membrane autophagosome and degraded in the vacuole/lysosome. Autophagy-related 8 (Atg8), a core Atg protein essential for autophagosome formation, is a marker of several autophagic structures: the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS), isolation membrane (IM), and autophagosome. Atg8 is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) through a ubiquitin-like conjugation system to yield Atg8-PE; this reaction is called Atg8 lipidation. Although the mechanisms of Atg8 lipidation have been well studied in vitro, the cellular locale of Atg8 lipidation remains enigmatic. Atg3 is an E2-like enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation reaction between Atg8 and PE. Therefore, we hypothesized that the localization of Atg3 would provide insights about the site of the lipidation reaction. To explore this idea, we constructed functional GFP-tagged Atg3 (Atg3-GFP) by inserting the GFP portion immediately after the handle region of Atg3. During autophagy, Atg3-GFP transiently formed a single dot per cell on the vacuolar membrane. This Atg3-GFP dot colocalized with 2× mCherry-tagged Atg8, demonstrating that Atg3 is localized to autophagic structures. Furthermore, we found that Atg3-GFP is localized to the IM by fine-localization analysis. The localization of Atg3 suggests that Atg3 plays an important role in autophagosome formation at the IM."
https://openalex.org/W1966910407,"Introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved survival of HIV infected individuals, while the relative contribution of liver-related mortality increased. Especially in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension represent the main causes of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Circulating miRNA-122 levels are elevated in HIV patients and have been shown to correlate with severity of liver injury. However, the association of miRNA-122 levels and hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension remains to be explored in HIV/HCV coinfection.From a total of 74 (31% female) patients with HIV/HCV coinfection were included. Serum levels of miRNA-122 were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and normalized to SV-40 spike-in RNA. Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was measured in 52 (70%) patients and the fibrosis stage was determined in 63 (85%) patients using transient elastography.The levels of circulating miRNA-122 were increased in HIV/HCV coinfected patients and significantly correlated with the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (rs = 0.438; p<0.001) and aspartate transaminase AST values (rs = 0.336; p = 0.003), but not with fibrosis stage (p = n.s.). Interestingly, miRNA-122 levels showed an inverse correlation with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) (rs = -0.302; p = 0.03).Elevated miRNA-122 levels are associated with liver injury, and with low HVPG. Though, miRNA-122 levels are not suitable to predict the degree of fibrosis, they might function as indicators for portal hypertension in HIV/HCV coinfected patients."
https://openalex.org/W2038269543,"Lead ions are particularly dangerous to the photosynthetic apparatus, but little is known about the effects of trace metals, including Pb, on regulation of chloroplast redistribution. In this study a new effect of lead on chloroplast distribution patterns and movements was demonstrated in mesophyll cells of a small-sized aquatic angiosperm Lemna trisulca L. (star duckweed). An analysis of confocal microscopy images of L. trisulca fronds treated with lead (15 μM Pb2+, 24 h) in darkness or in weak white light revealed an enhanced accumulation of chloroplasts in the profile position along the anticlinal cell walls, in comparison to untreated plants. The rearrangement of chloroplasts in their response to lead ions in darkness was similar to the avoidance response of chloroplasts in plants treated with strong white light. Transmission electron microscopy X-ray microanalysis showed that intracellular chloroplast arrangement was independent of the location of Pb deposits, suggesting that lead causes redistribution of chloroplasts, which looks like a light-induced avoidance response, but is not a real avoidance response to the metal. Furthermore, a similar redistribution of chloroplasts in L. trisulca cells in darkness was observed also under the influence of exogenously applied hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In addition, we detected an enhanced accumulation of endogenous H2O2 after treatment of plants with lead. Interestingly, H2O2-specific scavenger catalase partly abolished the Pb-induced chloroplast response. These results suggest that H2O2 can be involved in the avoidance-like movement of chloroplasts induced by lead. Analysis of photometric measurements revealed also strong inhibition (but not complete) of blue-light-induced chloroplast movements by lead. This inhibition may result from disturbances in the actin cytoskeleton, as we observed fragmentation and disappearance of actin filaments around chloroplasts. Results of this study show that the mechanisms of the toxic effect of lead on chloroplasts can include disturbances in their movement and distribution pattern."

In this study we aimed to characterize to what extent and through what mechanism BA affect HDV cell entry.HuH-7 cells stably expressing NTCP (HuH-7/NTCP) and primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were infected with in vitro generated HDV particles. Infectivity in the absence or presence of compounds was assessed using immunofluorescence staining for HDV antigen, standard 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assays and quantitative PCR.Addition of primary conjugated and unconjugated BA resulted in a dose dependent reduction in the number of infected cells while secondary, tertiary and synthetic BA had a lesser effect. This effect was observed both in HuH-7/NTCP and in PHH. Other replication cycle steps such as replication and particle assembly and release were unaffected. Moreover, inhibitory BA competed with a fragment from the large HBV envelope protein for binding to NTCP-expressing cells. Conversely, the sodium/BA-cotransporter function of NTCP seemed not to be required for HDV infection since infection was similar in the presence or absence of a sodium gradient across the plasma membrane. When chenodeoxycolic acid (15 mg per kg body weight) was administered to three chronically HDV infected individuals over a period of up to 16 days there was no change in serum HDV RNA.Primary BA inhibit NTCP-mediated HDV entry into hepatocytes suggesting that modulation of the BA pool may affect HDV infection of hepatocytes."

In order to do this we combined published data from existing flipper tagging and early satellite tracking studies with data from an additional 12 satellite tracked green turtles (1996-2006). Three of these were tracked from their foraging grounds in the Gulf of California along the east coast of the Baja California peninsula to their breeding grounds in Michoacán (1337-2928 km). In addition, three post-nesting females were satellite tracked from Colola beach, Michoacán to their foraging grounds in southern Mexico and Central America (941.3-3020 km). A further six turtles were tracked in the Gulf of California within their foraging grounds giving insights into the scale of ranging behaviour. Turtles undertaking long-distance migrations showed a tendency to follow the coastline. Turtles tracked within foraging grounds showed that foraging individuals typically ranged up to 691.6 km (maximum) from release site location. Additionally, we carried out threat analysis (using the cumulative global human impact in the Eastern Pacific) clustering pre-existing satellite tracking studies from Galapagos, Costa Rica, and data obtained from this study; this indicated that turtles foraging and nesting in Central American waters are subject to the highest anthropogenic impact. Considering that turtles from all three rookeries were found to migrate towards Central America, it is highly important to implement conservation plans in Central American coastal areas to ensure the survival of the remaining green turtles in the Eastern Pacific. Finally, by combining satellite tracking data from this and previous studies, and data of tag returns we created the best available distributional patterns for this particular sea turtle species, which emphasized that conservation measures in key areas may have positive consequences on a regional scale."
https://openalex.org/W1982066296,"While targeted therapy brought a new era in the treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma, therapeutic options for non-BRAF mutant cases are still limited. In order to explore the antitumor activity of prenylation inhibition we investigated the response to zoledronic acid treatment in thirteen human melanoma cell lines with known BRAF, NRAS and PTEN mutational status. Effect of zoledronic acid on proliferation, clonogenic potential, apoptosis and migration of melanoma cells as well as the activation of downstream elements of the RAS/RAF pathway were investigated in vitro with SRB, TUNEL and PARP cleavage assays and videomicroscopy and immunoblot measurements, respectively. Subcutaneous and spleen-to-liver colonization xenograft mouse models were used to evaluate the influence of zoledronic acid treatment on primary and disseminated tumor growth of melanoma cells in vivo. Zoledronic acid more efficiently decreased short-term in vitro viability in NRAS mutant cells when compared to BRAF mutant and BRAF/NRAS wild-type cells. In line with this finding, following treatment decreased activation of ribosomal protein S6 was found in NRAS mutant cells. Zoledronic acid demonstrated no significant synergism in cell viability inhibition or apoptosis induction with cisplatin or DTIC treatment in vitro. Importantly, zoledronic acid could inhibit clonogenic growth in the majority of melanoma cell lines except in the three BRAF mutant but PTEN wild-type melanoma lines. A similar pattern was observed in apoptosis induction experiments. In vivo zoledronic acid did not inhibit the subcutaneous growth or spleen-to-liver colonization of melanoma cells. Altogether our data demonstrates that prenylation inhibition may be a novel therapeutic approach in NRAS mutant melanoma. Nevertheless, we also demonstrated that therapeutic sensitivity might be influenced by the PTEN status of BRAF mutant melanoma cells. However, further investigations are needed to identify drugs that have appropriate pharmacological properties to efficiently target prenylation in melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2058628809,"This study was focused on conservation genetics of threatened Hippocampus guttulatus on the Atlantic coast of NW Iberian Peninsula. Information about spatial structure and temporal stability of wild populations was obtained based on microsatellite markers, and used for monitoring a captive breeding program firstly initiated in this zone at the facilities of the Institute of Marine Research (Vigo, Spain). No significant major genetic structure was observed regarding the biogeographical barrier of Cape Finisterre. However, two management units under continuous gene flow are proposed based on the allelic differentiation between South-Atlantic and Cantabrian subpopulations, with small to moderate contemporary effective size based on single-sample methods. Temporal stability was observed in South-Atlantic population samples of H. guttulatus for the six-year period studied, suggesting large enough effective population size to buffer the effects of genetic drift within the time frame of three generations. Genetic analysis of wild breeders and offspring in captivity since 2009 allowed us to monitor the breeding program founded in 2006 in NW Spain for this species. Similar genetic diversity in the renewed and founder broodstock, regarding the wild population of origin, supports suitable renewal and rearing processes to maintain genetic variation in captivity. Genetic parentage proved single-brood monogamy in the wild and in captivity, but flexible short- and long-term mating system under captive conditions, from strict monogamy to polygamy within and/or among breeding seasons. Family analysis showed high reproductive success in captivity under genetic management assisted by molecular relatedness estimates to avoid inbreeding. This study provides genetic information about H. guttulatus in the wild and captivity within an uncovered geographical range for this data deficient species, to be taken into account for management and conservation purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2070463580,"Lunasin is a naturally occurring peptide isolated from soybeans and has been explored in cancer treatment. Lunasin inhibits NF-κB activation and thus pro-inflammatory cytokine and mediator production in macrophages. In this study we demonstrate that lunasin can effectively suppress allergic airway inflammation in two murine models of asthma. In an OVA+Alum sensitization model, intranasal lunasin treatment at the time of OVA challenges significantly reduced total cells counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and eosinophilia, peribronchiolar inflammatory infiltration, goblet cell metaplasia and airway IL-4 production. In an OVA+LPS intranasal sensitization model, lunasin treatment either at the time of sensitization or challenge has similar effects in suppress allergic airway inflammation including significantly reduced total cell and eosinophil counts in BAL fluid, inflammatory gene Fizz1 expression in the lung, and IL-4 production by OVA re-stimulated cells from mediastinal lymph nodes. We further show that intranasal instillation of OVA+lunasin significantly increases OVA-specific regulatory T cell (Treg) accumulation in the lung comparing to OVA only treatment. Taken together, our results suggest lunasin as an anti-inflammatory agent can be potentially used in asthma therapy or as an adjuvant to enhance the induction of antigen-specific Tregs and thus boost the efficacy of allergy immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2164586159,"Background and Objective Apart from its inotropic property, milrinone has vasodilator, anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects that could assist in the reversal of septic microcirculatory changes. This paper investigates the effects of milrinone on endotoxemia-related microcirculatory changes and compares them to those observed with the use of norepinephrine. Materials and Methods After skinfold chamber implantation procedures and endotoxemia induction by intravenous Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide administration (2 mg.kg-1), male golden Syrian hamsters were treated with two regimens of intravenous milrinone (0.25 or 0.5 μg.kg-1.min-1). Intravital microscopy of skinfold chamber preparations allowed quantitative analysis of microvascular variables. Macro-hemodynamic, biochemical, and hematological parameters and survival rate were also analyzed. Endotoxemic non-treated animals, endotoxemic animals treated with norepinephrine (0.2 μg.kg-1.min-1), and non-endotoxemic hamsters served as controls. Results Milrinone (0.5 μg.kg-1.min-1) was effective in reducing lipopolysaccharide-induced arteriolar vasoconstriction, capillary perfusion deficits, and inflammatory response, and in increasing survival. Norepinephrine treated animals showed the best mean arterial pressure levels but the worst functional capillary density values among all endotoxemic groups. Conclusion Our data suggests that milrinone yielded protective effects on endotoxemic animals’ microcirculation, showed anti-inflammatory properties, and improved survival. Norepinephrine did not recruit the microcirculation nor demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects."
https://openalex.org/W1973510395,"Stipa purpurea, an endemic forage species on the Tibetan Plateau, is highly resistant to cold and drought, but the mechanisms underlying its responses to drought stress remain elusive. An understanding of such mechanisms may be useful for developing cultivars that are adaptable to water deficit. In this study, we analyzed the physiological and proteomic responses of S. purpurea under increasing drought stress. Seedlings of S. purpurea were subjected to a drought gradient in a controlled experiment, and proteins showing changes in abundance under these conditions were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry analysis. A western blotting analysis was conducted to confirm the increased abundance of a heat-shock protein, NCED2, and a dehydrin in S. purpurea seedlings under drought conditions. We detected carbonylated proteins to identify oxidation-sensitive proteins in S. purpurea seedlings, and found that ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO) was one of the oxidation-sensitive proteins under drought. Together, these results indicated drought stress might inhibit photosynthesis in S. purpurea by oxidizing RuBisCO, but the plants were able to maintain photosynthetic efficiency by a compensatory upregulation of unoxidized RuBisCO and other photosynthesis-related proteins. Further analyses confirmed that increased abundance of antioxidant enzymes could balance the redox status of the plants to mitigate drought-induced oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2054131446,"Human parechoviruses (HPeVs), members of the family Picornaviridae, are associated with severe human clinical conditions such as gastrointestinal disease, encephalitis, meningitis, respiratory disease and neonatal sepsis. A new contemporary strain of HPeV1, KVP6 (accession no. KC769584), was isolated from a clinical specimen. Full-genome alignment revealed that HPeV1 KVP6 shares high genome homology with the German strain of HPeV1, 7555312 (accession no. FM178558) and could be classified in the clade 1B group. An intertypic recombination was shown within the P2-P3 genome regions of HPeV1. Cell-type tropism test showed that T84 cells (colon carcinoma cells), A549 cells (lung carcinoma cells) and DBTRG-5MG cells (glioblastoma cells) were susceptible to HPeV1 infection, which might be relevant clinically. A facilitated cytopathic effect and increased viral titers were reached after serial viral passages in Vero cells, with viral genome mutation found in later passages. HPeV1 is sensitive to elevated temperature because 39C incubation impaired virion production. HPeV1 induced innate immunity with phosphorylation of interferon (IFN) regulatory transcription factor 3 and production of type I IFN in A549 but not T84 cells. Furthermore, type I IFN inhibited HPeV1 production in A549 cells but not T84 cells; T84 cells may be less responsive to type I IFN stimulation. Moreover, HPeV1-infected cells showed downregulated type I IFN activation, which indicated a type I IFN evasion mechanism. The characterization of the complete genome and infection features of HPeV1 provide comprehensive information about this newly isolated HPeV1 for further diagnosis, prevention or treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2039908740,"Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a progressive disorder caused by deficiency of α-L-iduronidase (IDUA), which leads to storage of heparan and dermatan sulphate. It is suggested that early enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) leads to better outcomes, although many patients are diagnosed late and don’t receive immediate treatment. This study aims to evaluate the effects of late onset ERT in a MPS I murine model. MPS I mice received treatment from 6 to 8 months of age (ERT 6–8mo) with 1.2mg laronidase/kg every 2 weeks and were compared to 8 months-old wild-type (Normal) and untreated animals (MPS I). ERT was effective in reducing urinary and visceral GAG to normal levels. Heart GAG levels and left ventricular (LV) shortening fraction were normalized but cardiac function was not completely improved. While no significant improvements were found on aortic wall width, treatment was able to significantly reduce heart valves thickening. High variability was found in behavior tests, with treated animals presenting intermediate results between normal and affected mice, without correlation with cerebral cortex GAG levels. Cathepsin D activity in cerebral cortex also did not correlate with behavior heterogeneity. All treated animals developed anti-laronidase antibodies but no correlation was found with any parameters analyzed. However, intermediary results from locomotion parameters analyzed are in accordance with intermediary levels of heart function, cathepsin D, activated glia and reduction of TNF-α expression in the cerebral cortex. In conclusion, even if started late, ERT can have beneficial effects on many aspects of the disease and should be considered whenever possible."
https://openalex.org/W2071771574,"Light microscopy enables noninvasive imaging of fluorescent species in biological specimens, but resolution is generally limited by diffraction to ~200–250 nm. Many biological processes occur on smaller length scales, highlighting the importance of techniques that can image below the diffraction limit and provide valuable single-molecule information. In recent years, imaging techniques have been developed which can achieve resolution below the diffraction limit. Utilizing one such technique, fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy (FPALM), we demonstrated its ability to construct super-resolution images from single molecules in a living zebrafish embryo, expanding the realm of previous super-resolution imaging to a living vertebrate organism. We imaged caveolin-1 in vivo, in living zebrafish embryos. Our results demonstrate the successful image acquisition of super-resolution images in a living vertebrate organism, opening several opportunities to answer more dynamic biological questions in vivo at the previously inaccessible nanoscale."
https://openalex.org/W2023121987,"The predator-prey interactions in the offshore food web of Lake Superior have been well documented, but the sensory systems mediating these interactions remain unknown. The deepwater sculpin, (Myoxocephalus thompsoni), siscowet (Salvelinus namaycush siscowet), and kiyi (Coregonus kiyi) inhabit low light level environments. To investigate the potential role of vision in predator-prey interactions, electroretinography was used to determine visual sensitivity for each species. Spectral sensitivity curves revealed peak sensitivity at 525 nm for each species which closely corresponds to the prevalent downwelling light spectrum at depth. To determine if sufficient light was available to mediate predator-prey interactions, visual sensitivity was correlated with the intensity of downwelling light in Lake Superior to construct visual depth profiles for each species. Sufficient daytime irradiance exists for visual interactions to approximately 325 m for siscowet and kiyi and 355 m for the deepwater sculpin during summer months. Under full moon conditions, sufficient irradiance exists to elicit ERG response to light available at approximately 30 m for the siscowet and kiyi and 45 m for the deepwater sculpin. Visual interactions are therefore possible at the depths and times when these organisms overlap in the water column indicating that vision may play a far greater role at depth in deep freshwater lakes than had been previously documented."
https://openalex.org/W1978303736,"Background Blood volume may profoundly affect the isolation of microorganisms in blood cultures. The effect of blood volume in standard anaerobic bottles of the BacT/ALERT 3D system was investigated. Methods Adult patients who visited the emergency department and referred for blood culture (n = 824) were enrolled from June to September 2013. Two sets of blood cultures were obtained from each patient. One set consisted of 5 mL that was collected in a standard aerobic bottle (SA5), 5 mL that was collected in a standard anaerobic bottle (SN5), and 10 mL that was collected in a standard anaerobic bottle (SN10). The growth of clinically significant pathogens and the time to detection (TTD) were compared between the SN5 and SN10 samples. Results Increasing the volume of blood collected from 5 to 10 mL yielded a 14.7% improvement in the isolation of microorganisms. There was a statistically significant difference in the isolation of pathogens (14 vs. 30, P = 0.023) between the SN5 and SN10 samples. Gram-positive microorganisms were detected earlier in the SN10 samples than the SN5 samples (P = 0.052). The mean TTD of all pathogens was 13.5 h for the SN5 samples and 12.9 h for the SN10 samples (P = 0.099). Conclusion Increased blood volume in the SN bottle yielded a significantly higher pathogen detection rate. However, there was no difference in the frequency of earlier detection or TTD between the SN5 and SN10 samples."
https://openalex.org/W2073164269,"Harmful algal blooms have caused enormous damage to the marine ecosystem and the coastal economy in China. In this paper, a bacterial strain B1, which had strong algicidal activity against Phaeocystis globosa, was isolated from the coastal waters of Zhuhai in China. The strain B1 was identified as Bacillus sp. on the basis of 16S rDNA gene sequence and morphological characteristics. To evaluate the ecological safety of the algicidal substances produced by strain B1, their toxic effects on marine organisms were tested. Results showed that there were no adverse effects observed in the growth of Chlorella vulgaris, Chaetoceros muelleri, and Isochrystis galbana after exposure to the algicidal substances at a concentration of 1.0% (v/v) for 96 h. The 48h LC50 values for Brachionus plicatilis, Moina mongolica Daday and Paralichthys olivaceus were 5.7, 9.0 and 12.1% (v/v), respectively. Subsequently, the algicidal substances from strain B1 culture were isolated and purified by silica gel column, Sephadex G-15 column and high-performance liquid chromatography. Based on quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and PeakView Software, the purified substances were identified as prolyl-methionine and hypoxanthine. Algicidal mechanism indicated that prolyl-methionine and hypoxanthine inhibited the growth of P. globosa by disrupting the antioxidant systems. In the acute toxicity assessment using M. mongolica, 24h LC50 values of prolyl-methionine and hypoxanthine were 7.0 and 13.8 g/L, respectively. The active substances produced by strain B1 can be considered as ecologically and environmentally biological agents for controlling harmful algal blooms."
https://openalex.org/W1982664993,"Reactivation of fetal gene expression patterns has been implicated in common cardiac diseases in adult life including left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) in arterial hypertension. Thus, increased wall stress and neurohumoral activation are discussed to induce the return to expression of fetal genes after birth in LVH. We therefore aimed to identify novel potential candidates for LVH by analyzing fetal-adult cardiac gene expression in a genetic rat model of hypertension, i.e. the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP). To this end we performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis in SHRSP to identify differences in expression patterns between day 20 of fetal development (E20) and adult animals in week 14 in comparison to a normotensive rat strain with contrasting low LV mass, i.e. Fischer (F344). 15232 probes were detected as expressed in LV tissue obtained from rats at E20 and week 14 (p < 0.05) and subsequently screened for differential expression. We identified 24 genes with SHRSP specific up-regulation and 21 genes with down-regulation as compared to F344. Further bioinformatic analysis presented Efcab6 as a new candidate for LVH that showed only in the hypertensive SHRSP rat differential expression during development (logFC = 2.41, p < 0.001) and was significantly higher expressed in adult SHRSP rats compared with adult F344 (+ 76%) and adult normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (+ 82%). Thus, it represents an interesting new target for further functional analyses and the elucidation of mechanisms leading to LVH. Here we report a new approach to identify candidate genes for cardiac hypertrophy by combining the analysis of gene expression differences between strains with a contrasting cardiac phenotype with a comparison of fetal-adult cardiac expression patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2012127887,"IL-9/Th9 responses are recently found to be important for innate and adaptive immunity particularly in parasitic infections. To date, the study on the role of IL-9 in bacterial infections is limited and the reported data are contradictory. One reported function of IL-9/Th9 is to modulate Th1/Th17 responses. Since our and others’ previous work has shown a critical role of Th1 and Th17 cells in host defense against chlamydial lung infection, we here examined the role of IL-9 responses in Chlamydia muridarum (Cm) lung infection, particularly its effect on Th1 and Th17 responses and outcome infection. Our data showed quick but transient IL-9 production in the lung following infection, peaking at day 3 and back to baseline around day 7. CD4+ T cell was the major source of IL-9 production in the lung infection. Blockade of endogenous IL-9 using neutralizing antibody failed to change Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-17 production by cultured spleen mononuclear cells isolated from Cm infected mice. Similarly, in vivo neutralization of IL-9 failed to show significant effect on T cell (Th1 and Th17) and antibody responses (IgA, IgG1 and IgG2a). Consistently, the neutralization of IL-9 had no significant effect on disease process, including body weight change, bacterial burden and histopathological score. The data suggest that IL-9 production following chlamydial lung infection is redundant for host defense against the intracellular bacteria."
