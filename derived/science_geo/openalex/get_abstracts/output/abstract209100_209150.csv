https://openalex.org/W2009040429,Data from 15 societies are presented showing substantial intersocietal differences of two types in susceptibility to geometric optical illusions. The pattern of response differences suggests the existence of different habits of perceptual inference which relate to cultural and ecological factors in the visual environment.

https://openalex.org/W2023380061,"Phosphates in fertilizers contain cadmium. When vegetables usually devoid of cadmium were grown in soil heavily fertilized with 20 percent superphosphate, they absorbed it. Vegetables normally containing cadmium absorbed larger quantities in the presence of superphosphate and little or none in its absence. The superphosphate showed 7.25 parts of cadmium per million. Five grains usually containing cadmium were grown in unfertilized soil poor in this element; four did not absorb it. Phosphate fertilizers may be a source of the cadmium in some vegetable foods."

This compound has been shown to arise by the isomerization of 4-deoxy-L-threo-5-hexoseulose uranic acid and be converted 2-deoxy-3-keto-n-gluconic by a specific pyridine-linked dehydrogenase. The isomerase and the dehydrogenase enzymes responsible for this interconversion have been prepared in partially purified form, and a study of their properties has been undertaken. n-Galacturonic acid, the alternate monosaccharide end product of polygalacturonate metabolism, has been shown to be readily converted to n-tagaturonic, n-altronic, and 2-keto-3-deoxy-n- gluconic acids by extracts of the adapted pseudomonad employed in these studies.

These effects could result from the action of the drug on placental function and blood supply."

Drinking and running were then made contingent on pressing a bar. Barpressing increased monotonically with the associated response probability, and equally for drinking and running. The results support the assumption that different responses of equal probability have equal reinforcement value."

Washed specific precipitates of 5S antibody and egg albumin, when added to guinea pig serum, fixed up to 40 percent of the total complement. This fixation could not be attributed to contamination with 7S antibody. Absorption of guinea pig serum with washed precipitates of 5S antibody and antigen removed that portion of complement which was fixed by fresh 5S antibody-antigen aggregates, but not that fixed by 7S antibody-antigen aggregates. The presence of 0.001M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid prevented this absorption of complement by the 5S aggregates."

The metabolism of a tumour-bearing organism also assumes features peculiar to the tumour2. In this connexion I examined the process of formation of induced tumour in tissues which were morphologically homogeneous but differed in levels of glycolysis and respiration.

https://openalex.org/W2020364512,THE clinical significance of blood standard bicarbonate has not yet been firmly established. Relatively little information is available at present concerning the effect of surgical anaesthesia on this new parameter in capillary or arterial blood. Payne and Conway1 recently concluded that normal values for arterial blood standard bicarbonate were significantly lower than those reported by Astrup et al.2 on capillary specimens. The latter workers contend that comparable standard bicarbonate values are obtained from arterial and capillary blood. Evaluation of acid-base balance during anaesthesia in our hospital revealed that standard bicarbonate concentrations of capillary blood from conscious and anaesthetized subjects were consistent with those of Astrup et al.2.
