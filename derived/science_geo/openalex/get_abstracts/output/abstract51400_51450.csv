https://openalex.org/W1512149642,"Abstract Reduction of γM-globulins with various mercaptans produces 8 S subunits. Upon removal of the mercaptan, variable degrees of reaggregation of these subunits take place, depending on the particular γM-globulin and the dissociating mercaptan reagent used. The presence of imidazole or methionine inhibits the extent of reaggregation. The 8 S subunit remaining after removal of the mercaptan appears to be a mixed disulfide of the protein and has a molecular weight near 200,000. It persists in this form at pH 4 and in 6 m guanidine. Extensive alkylation of reduced protein gives a subunit which readily loses light (L) chain components. The molecular weight of this reduced-alkylated protein is near 160,000. It is partially dissociated into heavy (H) and L chains at pH 4 and completely so in 6 m guanidine. L chain protein formed at pH 4 in the absence of guanidine may be readily crystallized. The L and H chains have molecular weights near 22,500 and 66,000, respectively, in 6 m guanidine. Molecular weight data indicate that a 1,000,000 mol wt γM-globulin is composed of five subunits of mol wt 200,000. These subunits appear to consist of three L chains and two H chains, and the purified reduced-alkylated subunit, of one L chain and two H chains."

https://openalex.org/W1598999706,"Abstract The induction of phosphofructokinase by estrogenic hormones has been investigated in the uterus of the ovariectomized rat. Studies with estradiol-17β, estrone, estriol, and diethylstilbesterol revealed that estradiol-17β was the most potent inducer of phosphofructokinase activity. Dose response studies with estradiol-17β indicated that 1.0 µg/100 g was sufficient to induce a statistically significant increase in enzyme activity (142%); the maximum increase (391%) was observed with the 20.0-µg dose. Time course studies indicated that, following a single injection of estradiol-17β, a significant rise (156%) in phosphofructokinase activity was detectable at 4 hours and reached peak levels (377%) at 16 hours. The observed increase in uterine enzyme activity was inhibited by the administration of progesterone to estradiol-treated rats, although this hormone by itself exerted no significant effect. Actinomycin, puromycin, ethionine, cycloheximide, and 5-fluorouracil, inhibitors of ribonucleic acid and protein synthesis, largely blocked the estrogen-induced increase in phosphofructokinase activity observed 16 hours after hormone injection. Sequential studies further showed that actinomycin, which inhibits DNA-directed synthesis of RNA, completely prevented the hormone-induced responses which occurred during 24- and 72-hour periods. The data presented suggest that the increases in uterine phosphofructokinase activity induced by estradiol-17β represent enzyme synthesis de novo probably involving enhanced RNA production."

https://openalex.org/W2009771809,"Type L light chains have been found in the cold agglutinins in the serums of three patients with chronic hemolytic anemia. Although two of these cold agglutinins are unusual in that they do not have specificity to I or i red-cell antigens (one of these has, in addition, cryoglobulin property), the third is a cold agglutinin of I specificity. Previously reported cold agglutinins from such patients have all been of type K; this is the first report of type L cold agglutinins associated with chronic hemolytic anemia."

https://openalex.org/W1534484572,"Abstract Six γM-globulins of antigenic Type K and one of Type L from patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia were purified, and their heavy (µ) and light κ or λ) chains were separated by reduction-alkylation and gel filtration. The purified γM-globulins and their isolated polypeptide chains were characterized by starch gel electrophoresis, immunological study, amino acid and NH2-terminal group analysis, and peptide maps. The γM-globulins were generally similar in amino acid composition but differed markedly from their constituent heavy and light chains and also from γG- and γA-globulins. The Type K (κ) light chains had NH2-terminal aspartic acid (five cases) or glutamic acid (one case), but no NH2-terminal group was detected in the Type L (λ) light chain and some of the heavy chains. For each γM-globulin the heavy and light chains were complementary in amino acid composition and peptide maps with respect to the whole protein, but differed greatly from each other. All of the heavy chains had about two-thirds of their soluble tryptic peptides in common, but differed individually with respect to the others. The κ light chains shared some peptides, all of which were identifiable with known sequence areas in Type K Bence-Jones proteins, but, like the latter proteins, they differed in other peptides representing the variable NH2-terminal half of the chain. The light chain of one γM-globulin and the Bence-Jones protein from the same patient were similar in many properties. The results support a multichain structural model of γM-globulins composed of two light chains of about 23,000 mol wt and two heavy chains. Each kind of chain appears to have a structural region subject to individual variation."

In the course of chromatographic studies with o-phthalaldehyde, we have found a distinctive prolonged surface staining of the sweat pores of ourselves and our technicians1. As a result of subsequent study and observation a simple method was developed for selectively staining the sweat pore in light skinned individuals."

https://openalex.org/W2024713207,"The participation of metal ions in the terminal step of immune cytolysis was investigated with chelating agents. 1,10-Phenanthroline induced lysis of sensitized sheep erythrocytes which had reacted with the first eight components of human complement. Hemolysis caused by 1,10-phenanthroline resembled lysis produced by the ninth component of complement in dependence on cell-bound eighth component and on temperature and in inhibition by 0.09M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Bivalent metal ions reduced the hemolytic capacity of 1,10-phenanthroline, and Fe++ inhibited the activity of the ninth component. Since trivalent iron had no such effects, it is postulated that the hemolytic activity of 1,10-phenanthroline and the ninth component of complement is a function of their affinity for Fe++."
https://openalex.org/W1660742208,"Abstract A 2 S γ2-globulin was isolated from Cohn Fraction VI of pooled normal human plasma by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl and carboxymethyl cellulose columns and filtration through Sephadex G-100. Its plasma level was estimated to be approximately 0.1 mg/100 ml. Physicochemical and chemical characterization of this globulin revealed the following properties: molecular weight, 14,000; sedimentation coefficient, 1.9 S; diffusion constant, 13.5 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1; frictional ratio, 1.03; axial ratio, approximately 2; electrophoretic mobility at pH 8.6 in Γ/2 = 0.1 diethylbarbiturate buffer, -1.5 x 10-5 cm2 sec-1 volt-1; and isoelectric and isoionic points at pH 5.9 and pH 9.0, respectively. The optical rotatory dispersion suggested the presence of a β conformation and the probable absence of α-helical structures. This protein, which was shown to be free of carbohydrates, probably possesses one polypeptide chain, as judged by the terminal amino acid analyses (1 mole of carboxyl-terminal valine and 1 mole of amino-terminal tyrosine). The amino acid composition of this globulin differed significantly from those of Bence-Jones proteins and of the L chain of the 7 S γ-globulin."

https://openalex.org/W1984922929,"When serums of 11 patients with hypogammaglobulinemia were examined by acrylamide-gel electrophoresis, combined with diffusion analysis, for the gamma chain of immunoglobulin G, the electrophoretic distribution of immunoglobulin G differed from that of normal individuals. The differences consisted of limited heterogeneity and bimodal distributions of the proteins at times. Isolated immunoglobulin G from four of the patients showed similar phenomena. The findings indicate a deficient gene population in these patients."

In an investigation of the population of an endemic area in the Lebanon, Cowan et al.6 found that iodine deficiency was the primary cause of the endemic goitre. This deficiency could be intensified by the consumption of goitrogenic foods which cause either an increased iodine excretion or an inhibition of the biosynthesis of the thyroid hormone, thyroxine."

Each element in the specimen emits its own X-ray spectrum which consists of a number of prominent lines superimposed on a continuous background. The spectral lines emitted by each element are characteristic of the element, in the way that the D doublet (λ = 600 nm) is characteristic of the optical spectrum of sodium, and they can be used to identify the elements which are present in the specimen."

Thus, the previously observed limited heterogeneity of gamma globulin in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia is also associated with inefficiency in at least one biological function."

https://openalex.org/W1999608163,"WHEN blood serum is heated by being placed in boiling water the proteins coagulate and denaturation occurs. Such proteins do not migrate on paper electrophoresis. On the other hand, serum proteins subjected to temperatures higher than body temperature but lower than boiling point migrate in different ways depending on the temperature. Denaturation of proteins consists, essentially, of the cleavage of some cross-links between peptide chains. Heat denaturation is caused by the excessive thermal agitation of the peptide chains and the resulting cleavage of hydrogen bonds."
https://openalex.org/W2011313847,"AFTER infection of chick embryo cells with fowl plague virus (FPV), an influenza A virus, or with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), a para-influenza virus, “early proteins” are synthesized before viral RNA-synthesis starts1–4. These “early proteins” might function as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase as has been demonstrated for picornaviruses5. In contrast to the picornaviruses, the “early proteins” of the myxoviruses are stable1–4. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether or not the “early protein” induced by FPV is able to function for the multiplication of NDV."

https://openalex.org/W1573329840,"The boundary patterns of bovine serum obtained at pH 6.0 or 4.0 have been found to vary considerably with the transport media used. In contrast, bimodal patterns have been obtained exclusively at pH 2.5. Bimodality is ascribed to one of the following: (a) interaction between protein and buffer, (b) reversible molecular association reactions between albumins and globulins, or (c) heterogeneity with a spectrum of mobilities. Since, under the experimental conditions, no bimodal patterns were obtained with either purified bovine serum albumin or γ1-globulin, the first possibility can clearly be ruled out. The following facts, in addition to other pieces of supporting evidence, are in favor of the possibility of reequilibration and are inexplicable in terms of merging mobilities: (a) the fluctuation of mobility data and the percentage area fraction data, (b) the bimodal patterns obtained from both the isolated fractions in the rerun experiment, (c) the presence of albumin in both the isolated fractions, (d) the discrepancy between the calculated percentage area of fast peak and the actual measurement when bovine serum albumin was added to the serum, and (e) the presence of a complex boundary in sedimentation diagrams of bovine serum and its fractions obtained in acid buffer, but not in barbiturate buffer. The albumin component has been found to be essential for bimodal behavior from experiments both with serum and with synthetic mixtures of plasma proteins. An interpretation from the viewpoint of the configurational changes of bovine serum albumin at low acid pH is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2031496148,"THE effects of dye solvents on the selectivity of histo-logical staining have not been extensively investigated. Robards and Purvis1 have reported preferential staining of the gelatinous fibres of tension wood by chlorazol black E when dissolved in methyl cellosolve. Earlier the influence of solvents on the staining reactions of this dye was discussed by Cannon2. Puchtler and Sweat3 reported a method for selectively staining haemoglobin in sections with amido black in a methanol solution, but not in water. Investigation of phospholipid staining by Luxol fast blue G revealed a changing selectivity dependent on the solvent used4. This dye in methanol solution was later found to stain only collagen and elastin5."

https://openalex.org/W2032421294,"I HAVE recently investigated the immune response to a variety of azo–human gamma globulin derivatives in mice tolerant to the carrier protein, human gamma globulin (HGG)1. Judged by the elimination of trace-labelled HGG, it seemed that a single injection of azo-protein in Freund incomplete adjuvant had only a marginal effect on tolerance. Two exceptions were noticed, however, in experiments where mice tolerant to HGG wrere challenged with either double substituted azo–HGG or with o-sulph-anil-azo–HGG. On the other hand, compared with controls challenged with HGG, two injections of azo–HGG, 4–5 weeks apart, usually caused a significant increase in the number of responsive mice. Gel-diffusion techniques revealed that the injection of azo-proteins did not regularly cause a full return to responsiveness to HGG in mice neonatally rendered tolerant to this protein. The specificity of the antibody formed was found to be directed against antigenic determinants comprising the haptenic group and part of the protein carrier. The altered HGG preparations used had 2.6–13.6 azo groups per molecule of HGG and cross-reacted to 80–100 per cent with native HGG. The following experiments were devised to investigate the effect of azo–HGG with more haptenic groups attached and cross-reacting to a lower extent than the preparations previously used."
