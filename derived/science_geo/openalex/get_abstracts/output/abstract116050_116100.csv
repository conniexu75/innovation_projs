https://openalex.org/W2016434864,"A speech processing algorithm was developed to create more salient versions of the rapidly changing elements in the acoustic waveform of speech that have been shown to be deficiently processed by language-learning impaired (LLI) children. LLI children received extensive daily training, over a 4-week period, with listening exercises in which all speech was translated into this synthetic form. They also received daily training with computer ""games"" designed to adaptively drive improvements in temporal processing thresholds. Significant improvements in speech discrimination and language comprehension abilities were demonstrated in two independent groups of LLI children."

Immunocytochemistry was used to identify the FOS protein, an immediate-early gene product, in a group of ventrolateral preoptic neurons that is specifically activated during sleep. The retrograde tracer cholera toxin B, in combination with FOS immunocytochemistry, was used to show that sleep-activated ventrolateral preoptic neurons innervate the tuberomammillary nucleus, a posterior hypothalamic cell group thought to participate in the modulation of arousal. This monosynaptic pathway in the hypothalamus may play a key role in determining sleep-wake states."
https://openalex.org/W1997767982,"We present evidence that transcriptional activation of the human interferon-beta (IFN beta) gene requires the assembly of a higher order transcription enhancer complex (enhanceosome). This multicomponent complex includes at least three distinct transcription factors and the high mobility group protein HMG I(Y). Both the in vitro assembly and in vivo transcriptional activity of this complex require a precise helical relationship between individual transcription factor-binding sites. In addition, HMG I(Y), which binds specifically to three sites within the enhancer, promotes cooperative binding of transcriptional factors in vitro and is required for transcriptional synergy between these factors in vivo. Thus, HMG I(Y) plays an essential role in the assembly and function of the IFN beta gene enhanceosome."
https://openalex.org/W2026352347,"Children with language-based learning impairments (LLIs) have major deficits in their recognition of some rapidly successive phonetic elements and nonspeech sound stimuli. In the current study, LLI children were engaged in adaptive training exercises mounted as computer ""games"" designed to drive improvements in their ""temporal processing"" skills. With 8 to 16 hours of training during a 20-day period, LLI children improved markedly in their abilities to recognize brief and fast sequences of nonspeech and speech stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2106468261,"Members of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family of MADS domain transcription factors cannot induce myogenesis in transfected fibroblasts, but when coexpressed with the myogenic basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins MyoD or myogenin they dramatically increase the extent of myogenic conversion above that seen with either myogenic bHLH factor alone. This cooperativity required direct interactions between the DNA-binding domains of MEF2 and the myogenic bHLH factors, but only one of the factors needed a transactivation domain, and only one of the factors needed to be bound to DNA. These interactions allow either factor to activate transcription through the other's binding site and reveal a novel mechanism for indirect activation of gene expression via protein-protein interactions between the DNA-binding domains of heterologous classes of transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2081784613,"In response to membrane depolarization, voltage-gated ion channels undergo a structural rearrangement that moves charges or dipoles in the membrane electric field and opens the channel-conducting pathway. By combination of site-specific fluorescent labeling of the Shaker potassium channel protein with voltage clamping, this gating conformational change was measured in real time. During channel activation, a stretch of at least seven amino acids of the putative transmembrane segment S4 moved from a buried position into the extracellular environment. This movement correlated with the displacement of the gating charge, providing physical evidence in support of the hypothesis that S4 is the voltage sensor of voltage-gated ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2049123604,"The XR-1 Chinese hamster ovary cell line is impaired in DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) and in ability to support V(D)J recombination of transiently introduced substrates. We now show that XR-1 cells support recombination-activating gene 1- and 2-mediated initiation of V(D)J recombination within a chromosomally integrated substrate, but are highly impaired in ability to complete the process by forming coding and recognition sequence joins. On this basis, we isolated a human cDNA sequence, termed XRCC4, whose expression confers normal V(D)J recombination ability and significant restoration of DSBR activity to XR-1, clearly demonstrating that this gene product is involved in both processes. The XRCC4 gene maps to the previously identified locus on human chromosome 5, is deleted in XR-1 cells, and encodes a ubiquitously expressed product unrelated to any described protein."
https://openalex.org/W2088587327,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are hypersusceptible to chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections. Cultured human airway epithelial cells expressing the Î”F508 allele of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) were defective in uptake of P. aeruginosa compared with cells expressing the wild-type allele. Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-core oligosaccharide was identified as the bacterial ligand for epithelial cell ingestion; exogenous oligosaccharide inhibited bacterial ingestion in a neonatal mouse model, resulting in increased amounts of bacteria in the lungs. CFTR may contribute to a host-defense mechanism that is important for clearance of P. aeruginosa from the respiratory tract."
https://openalex.org/W2006250595,"The digestive vacuole of Plasmodium falciparum is the site of hemoglobin degradation, heme polymerization into crystalline hemozoin, and antimalarial drug accumulation. Antibodies identified histidine-rich protein II (HRP II) in purified digestive vacuoles. Recombinant or native HRP II promoted the formation of hemozoin, and chloroquine inhibited the reaction. The related HRP III also polymerized heme, and an additional HRP was identified in vacuoles. It is proposed that after secretion by the parasite into the host erythrocyte cytosol, HRPs are brought into the acidic digestive vacuole along with hemoglobin. After hemoglobin proteolysis, HRPs bind the liberated heme and mediate hemozoin formation."
https://openalex.org/W1993366229,"PHO4, a transcription factor required for induction of the PHO5 gene in response to phosphate starvation, is phosphorylated by the PHO80-PHO85 cyclin-CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) complex when yeast are grown in phosphate-rich medium. PHO4 was shown to be concentrated in the nucleus when yeast were starved for phosphate and was predominantly cytoplasmic when yeast were grown in phosphate-rich medium. The sites of phosphorylation on PHO4 were identified, and phosphorylation was shown to be required for full repression of PHO5 transcription when yeast were grown in high phosphate. Thus, phosphorylation of PHO4 by PHO80-PHO85 turns off PHO5 transcription by regulating the nuclear localization of PHO4."
https://openalex.org/W1995232523,"In this paper, we investigate DNA bending induced by proteins required for virus induction of the human interferon-beta (IFN beta) gene. We show that NF-kappa B-DNA complexes that are functionally distinct in the context of the IFN beta enhancer are also conformationally distinct and that two sites in the enhancer contain in-phase bends that are counteracted or reversed by the binding of NF-kappa B, ATF-2/c-Jun, and HMG I(Y). Strikingly, this modulation of intrinsic enhancer architecture results in an orientation that favors predicted protein-protein interactions in a functional nucleoprotein complex, the enhanceosome. Furthermore, the subtle modulation of DNA structure by HMG I(Y) in this process distinguishes it from other architectural factors."
https://openalex.org/W2024534366,"A complete and accurate set of experimental crystallographic phases to a resolution of 1.8 angstroms was obtained for a 230-residue dimeric fragment of rat mannose-binding protein A with the use of multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing. An accurate image of the crystal structure could thus be obtained without resort to phases calculated from a model. Partially reduced disulfide bonds, local disorder, and differences in the mobility of chemically equivalent molecules are apparent in the experimental electron density map. A solvation layer is visible that includes well-ordered sites of hydration around polar and charged protein atoms, as well as diffuse, partially disordered solvent shells around exposed hydrophobic groups. Because the experimental phases and the resulting electron density map are free from the influence of a model, they provide a stringent test of theoretical models of macromolecular solvation, motion, and conformational heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W1615077657,"Developing insects repeatedly shed their cuticle by means of a stereotyped behavior called ecdysis, thought to be initiated by the brain peptide eclosion hormone. Here an ecdysis-triggering hormone, Mas-ETH, is described from the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta. Mas-ETH contains 26 amino acids and is produced by a segmentally distributed endocrine system of epitracheal glands (EGs). The EGs undergo a marked reduction in volume, appearance, and immunohistochemical staining during ecdysis, at which time Mas-ETH is found in the hemolymph. Injection of EGs extract or synthetic Mas-ETH into pharate larvae, pupae, or adults initiates preecdysis within 2 to 10 minutes, followed by ecdysis. Sensitivity to injected Mas-ETH appears much earlier before ecdysis and occurs with shorter latency than that reported for eclosion hormone. The isolated central nervous system responds to Mas-ETH, but not to eclosion hormone, with patterned motor bursting corresponding to in vivo preecdysis and ecdysis. Mas-ETH may be an immediate blood-borne trigger for ecdysis through a direct action on the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2091345755,"Development is buffered against unpredictable environmental and genetic effects. Here, a molecular genetic analysis of one type of developmental homeostasis, the establishment of thoracic segmental identity under the control of the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene in Drosophila melanogaster, is presented. Flies were artificially selected for differential sensitivity to the induction of bithorax phenocopies by ether vapor. The experiments demonstrated that increased sensitivity to ether correlated with a loss of expression of UBX in the third thoracic imaginal discs and that a significant proportion of the genetic variation for transcriptional stability can be attributed to polymorphism in the Ubx gene."

https://openalex.org/W1981123122,"SARs are candidate DNA elements for defining the bases of chromatin loops and possibly for serving as cis elements of chromosome dynamics. SARs contain numerous A tracts, whose altered DNA structure is recognized by cooperatively interacting proteins such as topoisomerase II. We constructed multi-AT hook (MATH) proteins and demonstrate that they specifically bind the clustered A tracts of SARs in chromatin and chromosomes. They are also potent inhibitors of chromosome assembly in mitotic Xenopus extracts, demonstrating the importance of SARs in this process. Titration of SARs with MATH20 (20 hooks) blocks shape determination of chromatids but not chromatin condensation per se. SARs are also required for shape maintenance of chromosomes. If MATH20 is added after formation of chromatids, they collapse and are reshaped by an active, mitotic process into spherical chromatid balls."
https://openalex.org/W1967389324,"Members of the chaperonin-10 (cpn10) protein family, also called heat shock protein 10 and in Escherichia coli GroES, play an important role in ensuring the proper folding of many proteins. The crystal structure of the Mycobacterium leprae cpn10 (Ml-cpn10) oligomer has been elucidated at a resolution of 3.5 angstroms. The architecture of the Ml-cpn10 heptamer resembles a dome with an oculus in its roof. The inner surface of the dome is hydrophilic and highly charged. A flexible region, known to interact with cpn60, extends from the lower rim of the dome. With the structure of a cpn10 heptamer now revealed and the structure of the E. coli GroEL previously known, models of cpn10:cpn60 and GroEL:GroES complexes are proposed."

https://openalex.org/W2001667458,"The structural features of the G.U wobble pair in Escherichia coli alanine transfer RNA (tRNA(Ala)) that are associated with aminoacylation by alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) were investigated in vivo for wild-type tRNA(Ala) and mutant tRNAs with G.U substitutions. tRNA(Ala) with G.U, C.A, or G.A gave similar amounts of charged tRNA(Ala) and supported viability of E. coli lacking chromosomal tRNA(Ala) genes. tRNA(Ala) with G.C was inactive. Recognition of G.U by AlaRS thus requires more than the functional groups on G.U in a regular helix and may involve detection of a helical distortion."

https://openalex.org/W2066500717,"Conventional myosin functions universally as a generator of motive force in eukaryotic cells. Analysis of mutants of the microorganism Dictyostelium discoideum revealed that myosin also provides resistance against high external osmolarities. An osmo-induced increase of intracellular guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate was shown to mediate phosphorylation of three threonine residues on the myosin tail, which caused a relocalization of myosin required to resist osmotic stress. This redistribution of myosin allowed cells to adopt a spherical shape and may provide physical strength to withstand extensive cell shrinkage in high osmolarities."
https://openalex.org/W2070394329,"Early stages of T cell development are thought to include a series of coordinated interactions between thymocytes and other cells of the thymus. A monoclonal antibody specific for mouse CD81 was identified that blocked the appearance of alpha beta but not gamma delta T cells in fetal organ cultures initiated with day 14.5 thymus lobes. In reaggregation cultures with CD81-transfected fibroblasts, CD4-CD8- thymocytes differentiated into CD4+CD8+ T cells. Thus, interactions between immature thymocytes and stromal cells expressing CD81 are required and may be sufficient to induce early events associated with T cell development."

https://openalex.org/W2021042546,"Using transgenic substrates, we found that the immunoglobulin kappa gene 3' enhancer (E3') acts as a negative regulator in V kappa-J kappa joining. Although the E3' was originally identified as a transcriptional enhancer, it acts in a suppressive manner for recombinational regulation. Base substitution analysis has shown that the PU.1-binding site within the E3' regulates the B/T specificity of V kappa-J kappa joining. In a substrate with a mutated PU.1-binding site (GAGGAA to TCTTCG), V kappa-J kappa joining occurred not only in B cells, but also in T cells. The E3' region is also responsible for determining the pro-B/pre-B specificity of V kappa-J kappa joining. When the E3' region was deleted, kappa gene rearrangement actively occurred at the early pro-B stage of B cell development: nongermline (N) nucleotides were common at recombination junctions."

https://openalex.org/W2402254151,"Epithelial tumours develop through a sequence of pre-invasive lesions of increasing disarray driven by underlying somatic genetic changes. We have studied the occurrence of the two most common somatic genetic changes associated with lung cancer in a series of premalignant bronchial lesions representing different stages in lung tumorigenesis. We present evidence that allele loss on chromosome 3 precedes damage to the p53 gene. Damage to chromosome 3 itself appears to be sequential in that the pattern of allele loss seen in dysplasia is often much more discrete than in invasive tumours. This implies that preneoplastic lesions may be a useful source of material for deletion mapping studies aimed at localising the position of tumour suppressor genes. We illustrate this by the comparison of an interstitial deletion described in this study with a homozygous deletion we have described previously, which has resulted in a better definition of the localisation of a tumour suppressor gene believed to be involved in lung cancer development."

https://openalex.org/W2071619810,"All cases of familial Alzheimer9s disease are caused by mutations in either the gene for beta-amyloid precursor protein or the protein S182/STM. The normal functions of these transmembrane proteins are unknown, and it is unclear how they relate to one another. N. N. Dewji and S. J. Singer propose that these two proteins interact in a way analogous to the Sevenless and Bride of Sevenless proteins in the developing Drosophila eye and the lin-12 and sel-12 proteins in the developing vulva of Caenorhabditis elegans . He suggests that excess deposition of amyloid, a hallmark and likely cause of Alzheimer9s disease, would be a result of the abnormal processing of the protein-protein complex. This proposal is likely to provoke responses from the community. If you have a question or would like to comment on the ideas presented by Drs. Dewji and Singer in this Perspective or if you would like to read the comments posted by others, please go to our interactive Forum (click on the Forum button below).
