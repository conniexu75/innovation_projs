https://openalex.org/W3048714202,"The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein mediates viral attachment to ACE2 receptor and is a major determinant of host range and a dominant target of neutralizing antibodies. Here, we experimentally measure how all amino acid mutations to the RBD affect expression of folded protein and its affinity for ACE2. Most mutations are deleterious for RBD expression and ACE2 binding, and we identify constrained regions on the RBD's surface that may be desirable targets for vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics. But a substantial number of mutations are well tolerated or even enhance ACE2 binding, including at ACE2 interface residues that vary across SARS-related coronaviruses. However, we find no evidence that these ACE2-affinity-enhancing mutations have been selected in current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic isolates. We present an interactive visualization and open analysis pipeline to facilitate use of our dataset for vaccine design and functional annotation of mutations observed during viral surveillance."

Here we integrated topological maps for colon tumors and normal colons with epigenetic, transcriptional, and imaging data to characterize alterations to chromatin loops, topologically associated domains, and large-scale compartments. We found that spatial partitioning of the open and closed genome compartments is profoundly compromised in tumors. This reorganization is accompanied by compartment-specific hypomethylation and chromatin changes. Additionally, we identify a compartment at the interface between the canonical A and B compartments that is reorganized in tumors. Remarkably, similar shifts were evident in non-malignant cells that have accumulated excess divisions. Our analyses suggest that these topological changes repress stemness and invasion programs while inducing anti-tumor immunity genes and may therefore restrain malignant progression.

Our findings call into question the conventional view that tumor-associated epigenomic alterations are primarily oncogenic. For over a century, pathologists have observed changes in the shape, size, and chromatin texture of cancer cell nuclei (Zink et al., 2004Zink D. Fischer A.H. Nickerson J.A. Nuclear structure in cancer cells.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Nuclear features help determine cancer subtype and grade, with significant effects on prognosis and therapy. However, despite their diagnostic and clinical importance, the molecular underpinnings of these cancer-associated morphological changes remain poorly understood. Molecular and genetic studies have documented widespread epigenetic defects in human tumors, including chromatin regulator mutations, DNA methylation changes, and altered enhancer landscapes (Baylin and Jones, 2016Baylin S.B. Jones P.A. Epigenetic Determinants of Cancer.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8: a019505Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Certain cancers also harbor mutations of proteins that regulate higher-order chromosomal structure (“genome topology”), including CTCF and cohesin subunits (Corces and Corces, 2016Corces M.R. Corces V.G. The three-dimensional cancer genome.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2016; 36: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Focal topological alterations drive oncogenic transcriptional programs in specific contexts (Flavahan et al., 2016Flavahan W.A. Drier Y. Liau B.B. Gillespie S.M. Venteicher A.S.

Technological innovations, including Hi-C (Rao et al., 2014Rao S.S.P. Huntley M.H. Durand N.C. Stamenova E.K. Bochkov I.D. Robinson J.T. Sanborn A.L. Machol I. Omer A.D. Lander E.S. Aiden E.L.

Organizational principles of 3D genome architecture.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2018; 19: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Chromatin loops occur when distant loci on the linear chromosome are in frequent contact and typically involve interactions between CTCF-bound sites (CTCF loops) and/or between enhancers and promoters (E-P loops). Topologically associating domains (TADs) are sub-megabase regions partitioned by boundary elements often bound by CTCF and cohesin. Finally, the genome is grossly partitioned into two large-scale compartments: an open, transcriptionally active A compartment and a compact, relatively silent B compartment. Colorectal adenocarcinoma, the fourth most common epithelial tumor, is a well-characterized model for cancer epigenetics. These tumors exhibit profoundly altered DNA methylation landscapes, including loss of methylation from large genomic ‘‘blocks’’ that cover over half of the genome (Berman et al., 2011Berman B.P. Weisenberger D.J. Aman J.F. Hinoue T. Ramjan Z. Liu Y. Noushmehr H. Lange C.P.E. van Dijk C.M.

Diep D. et al.Increased methylation variation in epigenetic domains across cancer types.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The functional implications of hypomethylation remain obscure, but it may impact genome stability and/or transcriptional activity (Baylin and Jones, 2016Baylin S.B. Jones P.A. Epigenetic Determinants of Cancer.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8: a019505Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Conversely, CpG island hypermethylation occurs in a subset of colon tumors, termed the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), and is associated with promoter silencing (Hinoue et al., 2012Hinoue T. Weisenberger D.J. Lange C.P.E. Shen H. Byun H.M. Van Den Berg D. Malik S. Pan F.

Ahuja N. Ohe-Toyota M. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Issa J.P. CpG island methylator phenotype in colorectal cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 8681-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). However, our understanding of these epigenomic changes and their relationship to genome topology has been hindered by a lack of data for primary tumors. Here we mapped genome topology across a cohort of colon tumors, normal colons, and colon cancer cell lines and compared successive layers of topology. We focus on large-scale reorganization of the conventional genome compartments A and B and characterize an intermediate compartment at their interface. Remarkably, compartmental reorganization is associated with repression of stem cell, invasion, and metastasis genes and induction of genes associated with anti-tumor immunity. Our results suggest that the most profound topological alterations in tumors are actually a consequence of accumulated cell divisions and that they may have a tumor-suppressive role. To understand how nuclear architecture is altered in cancer, we profiled genome topology along with DNA methylation, chromatin modifications, and CTCF in primary colon tumors, normal colons, and colon cancer cell lines (Figure 1A). Our clinical cohort included 26 tumors and 7 normal colon tissue samples (Table S1). Our in vitro models included colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, SW480, RKO, and LS-174T), a line derived from normal colon (FHC), and primary fibroblasts (WI-38). Our full dataset comprises 175 libraries and 28 billion sequencing reads for Hi-C, HiChIP, bisulfite sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We performed hybrid-capture bisulfite sequencing on 26 tumors, 3 normal colons, and 5 cell lines. Although only two tumors had CpG island hypermethylation (CIMP) (Figure S1A), all tumors exhibited degrees of hypomethylation across expansive genomic regions, termed “hypomethylated blocks” (Figure S1B; Berman et al., 2011Berman B.P. Weisenberger D.J. Aman J.F. Hinoue T. Ramjan Z. Liu Y. Noushmehr H. Lange C.P.E. van Dijk C.M.

Diep D. et al.Increased methylation variation in epigenetic domains across cancer types.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). We also inferred copy number variants (CNVs) for each tumor (Table S2) and controlled for CNV-related variability in further analyses by incorporating terms for copy number estimates into our linear models and verifying results in CNV-stable regions and tumors (STAR Methods). We integrated high-resolution topological maps and epigenomics data to investigate successive layers of genome organization, from chromatin loops to TADs to large-scale genome compartments, in tissues, tumors, and cell lines. We began by identifying loops that could influence transcriptional states in tumors. HiChIP assays targeting the cohesin subunit SMC1 (Mumbach et al., 2016Mumbach M.R. Rubin A.J. Flynn R.A. Dai C. Khavari P.A. Greenleaf W.J. Chang H.Y. HiChIP: efficient and sensitive analysis of protein-directed genome architecture.Nat. Methods. 2016; 13: 919-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reveal CTCF-CTCF loops, which contribute to TAD boundaries, as well as E-P loops, which are hypothesized to mediate enhancer gene activation (Stadhouders et al., 2019Stadhouders R. Filion G.J. Graf T. Transcription factors and 3D genome conformation in cell-fate decisions.Nature. 2019; 569: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We identified 25,125 loops in normal colon or tumors and annotated the subset that connects an histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) peak (enhancer-like) to an annotated promoter as E-P loops (n = 14,121). Differential analysis revealed 571 E-P loops that are stronger in tumors and 248 that are weaker in tumors (Figure 1B). To relate these differential loops to transcription, we evaluated the expression of the corresponding genes in our cohort and across 521 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012Cancer Genome Atlas NetworkComprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer.Nature. 2012; 487: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (4694) Google Scholar). Genes connected to E-P loops that were stronger in tumors were upregulated in tumors, whereas genes connected to E-P loops that were weaker in tumors were downregulated (Figures 1C and S2A; Table S3). This association was evident even when excluding loci subject to CNVs (Figure S2B). Several topological alterations involved known oncogenes or tumor suppressors. For example, although the locus encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase oncogene EPHA2 (Dunne et al., 2016Dunne P.D. Dasgupta S. Blayney J.K. McArt D.G. Redmond K.L. Weir J.A. Bradley C.A. Sasazuki T. Shirasawa S. Wang T. et al.EphA2 Expression Is a Key Driver of Migration and Invasion and a Poor Prognostic Marker in Colorectal Cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2016; 22: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) contains multiple enhancers in normal colon and tumors, the gene is connected to a strong enhancer by a tumor-associated E-P loop (Figures 1D and S2C). Accordingly, EPHA2 is upregulated in colon tumors (Figures S2D and S2E). Conversely, the PDCD4 tumor suppressor (Wang et al., 2017Wang Q. Zhu J. Wang Y.-W. Dai Y. Wang Y.-L. Wang C. Liu J. Baker A. Colburn N.H. Yang H.-S. Tumor suppressor Pdcd4 attenuates Sin1 translation to inhibit invasion in colon carcinoma.Oncogene. 2017; 36: 6225-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) loses an E-P loop to a distal enhancer and is downregulated in tumors (Figures 1E and S2F–S2H). The annotated E-P loops can also facilitate interpretation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with colon cancer risk (Figures S2I–S2K; Table S4; STAR Methods). A next layer of topological organization involves TADs and their boundaries. TADs are evident in Hi-C maps as sub-megabase-scale regions with increased intra-domain interactions (Figure 1F; Dixon et al., 2015Dixon J.R. Jung I. Selvaraj S. Shen Y. Antosiewicz-Bourget J.E. Lee A.Y. Ye Z. Kim A. Rajagopal N. Xie W. et al.Chromatin architecture reorganization during stem cell differentiation.Nature. 2015; 518: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). CTCF occupies and contributes to the stability of many TAD boundaries (Rao et al., 2014Rao S.S.P. Huntley M.H. Durand N.C. Stamenova E.K. Bochkov I.D. Robinson J.T. Sanborn A.L. Machol I. Omer A.D.

We used Hi-C data to assess the locations and integrity of TAD boundaries genome wide (STAR Methods). Boundary location and strength were largely concordant between tumors, normal controls, and cell lines (Figures 1G and S3A–S3D), consistent with previous studies of cell lines and non-malignant tissues (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R.

Tumors, on average, shared 92% of TAD boundaries with normal colon and 89% with the cell lines. Visual inspection revealed that discordant boundary calls were most often caused by subtle differences in strength rather than complete boundary loss. Prior studies have shown that CTCF boundaries may be disrupted by genetic deletion or hypermethylation (Flavahan et al., 2016Flavahan W.A. Drier Y. Liau B.B. Gillespie S.M. Venteicher A.S.

Consistently, we identified more than 100 TAD boundaries that gain DNA methylation and lose CTCF binding in our hypermethylated tumors (Figures S3E and S3F). The integrity of these boundaries was compromised, as evidenced by weaker “peaks” on the Hi-C contact maps (Figure S3G) and more frequent cross-boundary E-P interactions in HiChIP data (Figure S3H). However, the transcriptional consequences of these boundary losses appeared to be relatively limited (Figure S3I). In summary, topological boundaries were largely conserved across colon tumors, normal colons, and cell lines, with the exception of a relatively small set of boundaries compromised in hypermethylated tumors. The genome is partitioned into open A and closed B spatial compartments. TADs in the same compartment have a greater tendency to self-interact, whereas inter-compartmental interactions are disfavored (Rao et al., 2014Rao S.S.P. Huntley M.H. Durand N.C. Stamenova E.K. Bochkov I.D. Robinson J.T. Sanborn A.L. Machol I. Omer A.D. Lander E.S. Aiden E.L.

We used a standard eigenvector-based method to assign compartments for each of our Hi-C datasets. In contrast to the striking conservation of TAD boundaries, compartment assignments varied between samples. For example, most cell lines were distinct from normal tissues and tumors (Figures 2A, 2B, S4A, and S4B).Figure S4Compartment Reorganization, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Hi-C eigenvectors (PC1) based on long-range interactions demarcate compartments A (positive values, blue) and B (negative values, yellow) across a 45 Mb region of chromosome 6.

(K) Representative transmission electron microscopy (EM) images of nuclei from normal colon epithelium (top row) and colon tumors (bottom row). Comparisons also revealed widespread differences between colon tumors and normal colon (Figure 2B). To understand these differences, we directly compared Hi-C interaction matrices. Although compartment assignments were mostly concordant between normal colon and tumors (Figure 2A), long-range interactions between compartments A and B were more frequent in tumors (Figure 2C). These differential interaction patterns were evident regardless of whether the underlying compartment assignments were derived from normal colon or tumor Hi-C data (Figure S4C) and translated to a genome-wide increase in inter-compartment interaction in tumors (p < 0.005) (Figure S4D). Prior studies have related compartments with nuclear positioning (Falk et al., 2019Falk M. Feodorova Y. Naumova N. Imakaev M. Lajoie B.R. Leonhardt H. Joffe B. Dekker J. Fudenberg G.

Compartment B correlates with lamina-associated domains (LADs), which are located at the nuclear periphery and may be damaged in aging-related disease, senescence, and cancer (Sakthivel and Sehgal, 2016Sakthivel K.M.

Conversely, active loci tend to localize to the nuclear interior. In principle, relative nuclear positioning of genomic loci can be inferred from Hi-C data. We therefore used a maximum entropy approach to derive topological models for normal colon and tumor nuclei (STAR Methods). Our method models the genome at 1-Mb resolution as a 3-dimensional polymer, taking into account linear constraints inherent to the DNA. We then compute an in silico Hi-C map for each polymer model and repeat the process iteratively until the computed map converges on the experimental Hi-C data (Figure 2D; STAR Methods). Polymer models optimized to the normal colon Hi-C data separated compartments A and B and positioned compartment B peripherally (Figures 2E, S4E, and S4F), consistent with expectation. However, applying the same modeling approach to the colon tumor Hi-C data yielded a strikingly different result (Figures 2F and S4G). In these models, both compartments were distributed heterogeneously throughout the nucleus. We verified that these changes were not solely driven by genetic alterations by restricting analysis to stable chromosomes and a genomically stable tumor (Figures S4H and S4I). These results suggest that the asymmetric radial positioning of compartments A and B is profoundly altered in tumors. To further investigate, we directly visualized chromatin and specific genomic loci. First, we imaged specimens by transmission electron microscopy, which revealed characteristic epithelial structures"

Here, we show that a plant virus-encoded protein re-localizes from the plasma membrane to chloroplasts upon activation of plant defense, interfering with the chloroplast-dependent anti-viral salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis. Strikingly, we have found that plant pathogens from different kingdoms seem to have convergently evolved to target chloroplasts and impair SA-dependent defenses following an association with membranes, which relies on the co-existence of two subcellular targeting signals, an N-myristoylation site and a chloroplast transit peptide. This pattern is also present in plant proteins, at least one of which conversely activates SA defenses from the chloroplast. Taken together, our results suggest that a pathway linking plasma membrane to chloroplasts and activating defense exists in plants and that such pathway has been co-opted by plant pathogens during host-pathogen co-evolution to promote virulence through suppression of SA responses."

In the mouse olfactory bulb, inhalation of different odors leads to changes in the set of neurons activated, as well as when neurons are activated relative to each other (synchrony) and the onset of inhalation (latency). To explore the relevance of each mode of information transmission, we probed the sensitivity of mice to perturbations across each stimulus dimension (i.e., rate, synchrony, and latency) using holographic two-photon optogenetic stimulation of olfactory bulb neurons with cellular and single-action-potential resolution. We found that mice can detect single action potentials evoked synchronously across <20 olfactory bulb neurons. Further, we discovered that detection depends strongly on the synchrony of activation across neurons, but not the latency relative to inhalation."
https://openalex.org/W3080759967,"Climate change is impacting coral reefs now. Recent pan-tropical bleaching events driven by unprecedented global heat waves have shifted the playing field for coral reef management and policy. While best-practice conventional management remains essential, it may no longer be enough to sustain coral reefs under continued climate change. Nor will climate change mitigation be sufficient on its own. Committed warming and projected reef decline means solutions must involve a portfolio of mitigation, best-practice conventional management and coordinated restoration and adaptation measures involving new and perhaps radical interventions, including local and regional cooling and shading, assisted coral evolution, assisted gene flow, and measures to support and enhance coral recruitment. We propose that proactive research and development to expand the reef management toolbox fast but safely, combined with expedient trialling of promising interventions is now urgently needed, whatever emissions trajectory the world follows. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of embracing new interventions in a race against time, including their risks and uncertainties. Ultimately, solutions to the climate challenge for coral reefs will require consideration of what society wants, what can be achieved technically and economically, and what opportunities we have for action in a rapidly closing window. Finding solutions that work for coral reefs and people will require exceptional levels of coordination of science, management and policy, and open engagement with society. It will also require compromise, because reefs will change under climate change despite our best interventions. We argue that being clear about society’s priorities, and understanding both the opportunities and risks that come with an expanded toolset, can help us make the most of a challenging situation. We offer a conceptual model to help reef managers frame decision problems and objectives, and to guide effective strategy choices in the face of complexity and uncertainty."

https://openalex.org/W3080871630,"Experiences trigger transgenerational small RNA-based responses in C. elegans nematodes. Dedicated machinery ensures that heritable effects are reset, but how the responses segregate in the population is unknown. We show that isogenic individuals differ dramatically in the persistence of transgenerational responses. By examining lineages of more than 20,000 worms, three principles emerge: (1) The silencing each mother initiates is distributed evenly among her descendants; heritable RNAi dissipates but is uniform in every generation. (2) Differences between lineages arise because the mothers that initiate heritable responses stochastically assume different “inheritance states” that determine the progeny’s fate. (3) The likelihood that an RNAi response would continue to be inherited increases the more generations it lasts. The inheritance states are determined by HSF-1, which regulates silencing factors and, accordingly, small RNA levels. We found that, based on the parents’ inheritance state, the descendants’ developmental rate in response to stress can be predicted."
https://openalex.org/W3081179918,"Background As the current outbreak of COVID-2019 disease has spread to the other more than 150 countries besides China around the world and the death number constantly increased, the clinical data and radiological findings of death cases need to be explored so that more physicians, radiologists and researchers can gain important information to save more lives. Methods 73 patients who died from COVID-19 were retrospectively included. The clinical and laboratory data of the patients were extracted from electronic medical records. The clinical data, inflammation-related laboratory results, and CT imaging features were summarized. The laboratory results and dynamic changes of imaging features and severity scores of lung involvement based on chest CT were analyzed. Results The mean age was 67±12 years. The typical clinical symptoms included fever (88%), cough (62%) and dyspnea (23%). 65% patients had at least one underlying disease. GGO with consolidation was the most common feature for the five lung lobes (47%-53% among the various lobes), with total severity score of 12.97±5.87 for the both lungs. The proportion of GGO with consolidation is markedly increased on follow-up chest CT compared with initial CT scans, as well as the averaging total CT scores (14.53±5.76 vs. 6.60±5.65; P<0.001). The severity score was rated as severe (white lung) in 13% patients on initial CT scans, and in 60% on follow-up CT scans. Moderate positive correlations were found between CT scores and leucocytes, neutrophils and IL-2R (r = 0.447–0581, P<0.001). Conclusion Chest CT findings and laboratory test results were worsening in patients who died of COVID-19, with moderate positive correlations between CT severity scores and inflammation-related factors of leucocytes, neutrophils, and IL-2R. Chest CT imaging may play an more important role in monitoring disease progression and predicting prognosis."

PeriLCVGLUT2 neurons are a hub between hunger and thirst that specifically controls motivation for food and water ingestion, which is a factor that contributes to hedonic overeating and obesity. Animal survival depends on neural mechanisms that motivate behaviors for fulfilling essential bodily needs. Classically, motivated behaviors can be deconstructed into three phases (Figure 1A; Craig, 1917Craig W. Appetites and Aversions as Constituents of Instincts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1917; 3: 685-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The preparatory (foraging) phase involves seeking and obtaining a desired outcome, often due to an accumulation of physiological need. This phase is followed by the consummatory phase, which includes sensory, motor, and reward processes associated with consummating the goal of the behavior (e.g., eating or drinking food or water). Satiety develops during the consummatory phase and eventually terminates the behavior, for example by PBNCGRP neurons (Campos et al., 2016Campos C.A. Bowen A.J. Schwartz M.W. Palmiter R.D. Parabrachial CGRP Neurons Control Meal Termination.Cell Metab. 2016; 23: 811-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, Campos et al., 2018Campos C.A. Bowen A.J. Roman C.W. Palmiter R.D. Encoding of danger by parabrachial CGRP neurons.Nature. 2018; 555: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Elucidating neural mechanisms for these motivated behaviors requires monitoring neuron dynamics to determine the selective involvement of neurons in the preparatory, consummatory, or satiety phases. Agouti-related protein (AGRP) neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) are activated by signals of energy deficit (Cowley et al., 2003Cowley M.A. Smith R.G. Diano S. Tschöp M. Pronchuk N. Grove K.L. Strasburger C.J. Bidlingmaier M. Esterman M. Heiman M.L. et al.The distribution and mechanism of action of ghrelin in the CNS demonstrates a novel hypothalamic circuit regulating energy homeostasis.Neuron. 2003; 37: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Artificial activation of AGRP neurons in sated mice induces virtual need states that mimic aspects of hunger by leading to food-directed foraging and selectively elicits avid food consumption (Figure 1A; Aponte et al., 2011Aponte Y. Atasoy D. Sternson S.M. AGRP neurons are sufficient to orchestrate feeding behavior rapidly and without training.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar; Krashes et al., 2011Krashes M.J. Koda S. Ye C. Rogan S.C. Adams A.C. Cusher D.S. Maratos-Flier E. Roth B.L. Lowell B.B. Rapid, reversible activation of AgRP neurons drives feeding behavior in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 1424-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). AGRP neurons transmit negative valence, promote food seeking, and are rapidly inhibited when food is identified, such that activity is low during eating (Betley et al., 2015Betley J.N. Xu S. Cao Z.F.H. Gong R. Magnus C.J. Yu Y. Sternson S.M. Neurons for hunger and thirst transmit a negative-valence teaching signal.Nature. 2015; 521: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar; Chen et al., 2015Chen Y. Lin Y.C. Kuo T.W. Knight Z.A.

Arcuate hypothalamic AgRP and putative POMC neurons show opposite changes in spiking across multiple timescales.eLife. 2015; 4: e07122Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, AGRP neurons promote the preparatory phase of hunger, but they are not required for the consummatory phase of feeding behavior. If AGRP neurons do not have a primary role in sustaining food consumption, then other neuron populations must be responsible for this function (Sternson and Eiselt, 2017Sternson S.M. Eiselt A.K. Three Pillars for the Neural Control of Appetite.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2017; 79: 401-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The rhythmic actions of ingestion are mediated by motor circuits in the hindbrain (Wiesenfeld et al., 1977Wiesenfeld Z. Halpern B.P. Tapper D.N. Licking behavior: evidence of hypoglossal oscillator.Science. 1977; 196: 1122-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but control of ingestion and how long food is consumed are less well understood. Food palatability is associated with food pleasantness (hedonic value) and leads to a transition from “sampling to savoring” that prolongs bouts of consumption (Yeomans, 1998Yeomans M.R. Taste, palatability and the control of appetite.Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1998; 57: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In humans, hunger increases subjective reports of palatability (Cabanac, 1971Cabanac M. Physiological role of pleasure.Science. 1971; 173: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Easy access to low-cost, high-palatability food may also contribute to the rising incidence of obesity (Johnson and Wardle, 2014Johnson F. Wardle J. Variety, palatability, and obesity.Adv. Nutr. 2014; 5: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, palatability is a key factor controlling appetite (Sørensen et al., 2003Sørensen L.B. Møller P. Flint A. Martens M. Raben A. Effect of sensory perception of foods on appetite and food intake: a review of studies on humans.Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2003; 27: 1152-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), but little is known about the relationship between interoceptive sensory neurons and the neural circuits through which hunger shifts palatability and increases consumption. Hunger is not the only state that influences ingestion. Thirst increases the ingestion of water by nitric oxide synthase 1 (Nos1)-expressing neurons in the suprafornical organ (SFONOS1) that sense physiological dehydration, induce thirst-associated brain state changes, and selectively elicit water seeking (Allen et al., 2019Allen W.E. Chen M.Z. Pichamoorthy N. Tien R.H. Pachitariu M. Luo L. Deisseroth K. Thirst regulates motivated behavior through modulation of brainwide neural population dynamics.Science. 2019; 364: 253PubMed Google Scholar; Betley et al., 2015Betley J.N. Xu S. Cao Z.F.H. Gong R.

Thirst neurons anticipate the homeostatic consequences of eating and drinking.Nature. 2016; 537: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Hunger and thirst circuits involving AGRP neurons and SFONOS1 neurons have been considered primarily as discrete interoceptive pathways for distinct physiological states. Less consideration has been given to the shared behavioral mechanisms between these different need states and the potential convergence of hunger and thirst circuits. To investigate this knowledge gap, we leveraged the molecularly defined and separately localized AGRP and SFONOS1 neurons as entry points to study the convergence of hunger and thirst circuits. We identified glutamatergic neurons in the anterior peri-locus coeruleus (periLC) as a polysynaptic convergence region in hunger and thirst behaviors. Circuit dynamics and causal perturbations show that periLC neurons control eating and drinking by regulating palatability during the consummatory phase of behavior. AGRP and SFONOS1 neuron axon projections overlap in several downstream brain regions (Figure S1A). We hypothesized that feeding and drinking circuits converged at some points to mediate shared aspects of these behaviors. We developed a strategy to perform a broad search for anatomically defined and functionally important convergence points by using polysynaptic circuit mapping methods (Figure 1B). We looked for intersections of brain regions downstream of AGRP and SFONOS1 neurons identified by Cre-dependent herpes simplex virus (HSV) anterograde polysynaptic labeling (Lo and Anderson, 2011Lo L. Anderson D.J. A Cre-dependent, anterograde transsynaptic viral tracer for mapping output pathways of genetically marked neurons.Neuron. 2011; 72: 938-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with the fluorescent protein tdTomato. We also performed Fos-mapping after optogenetic activation of AGRP neurons or SFONOS1 neurons in the absence of food and water (Figures S1B and S1C) to identify downstream regions that are functionally activated in hunger and thirst. Brains from each group of mice were sectioned, stained, and registered to the Allen Institute Reference Brain Atlas, followed by image segmentation of labeled cells and nuclei and quantification of HSV-mediated tdTomato expression or Fos-immunoreactivity (IR) across multiple brain regions (Figure 1C; STAR Methods). Several subcortical areas contained both HSV-mediated tdTomato expression and Fos-IR, including some of the direct downstream projection targets of AGRP and SFONOS1 neurons, such as paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), and paraventricular thalamus (PVT) (Figure 1D; Figures S1D–S1F), which have been previously emphasized as being crucial for different aspects of hunger and thirst behavior (Betley et al., 2013Betley J.N.

The Forebrain Thirst Circuit Drives Drinking through Negative Reinforcement.Neuron. 2017; 96: 1272-1281.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We were especially interested in whether this approach could identify poorly characterized brain areas involved in feeding and drinking, and we noticed a hotspot of HSV and Fos labeling within the hindbrain at the dorsolateral portion of the pontine central gray (PCG). In both AGRP and SFONOS1 groups, we found similar labeling with HSV in the MEV (midbrain trigeminal nucleus), PCG, LC (locus coeruleus), LDT (laterodorsal tegmental area), SLD (sublaterodorsal tegmental area), and scp (superior cerebellar peduncles) (Figures 1D and 1E). Fos-IR was observed for both groups in the MEV, Barrington nucleus (B), and LDT (Figures 1D and 1F). We also found that cells in dorsolateral PCG showed elevated Fos in food-deprived (FD) mice or water-deprived (WD) mice but not in control mice (Figures 1F and S1G). In addition, we noted and a recent study reported (Li et al., 2019Li M.M. Madara J.C. Steger J.S. Krashes M.J. Balthasar N. Campbell J.N. Resch J.M. Conley N.J. Garfield A.S. Lowell B.B.

This area has been defined anatomically as the periLC (Shipley et al., 1996Shipley M.T. Fu L. Ennis M. Liu W.L. Aston-Jones G. Dendrites of locus coeruleus neurons extend preferentially into two pericoerulear zones.J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 365: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and includes the brain region surrounding the anterior portion of the LC that is flanked laterally by the MEV, medially by the LDT, and dorsally by the fourth ventricle (Figure 1G; see STAR Methods for explanation of anatomical terms). Single neuron reconstructions (Winnubst et al., 2019Winnubst J. Bas E. Ferreira T.A. Wu Z. Economo M.N. Edson P. Arthur B.J. Bruns C. Rokicki K. Schauder D. et al.Reconstruction of 1,000 Projection Neurons Reveals New Cell Types and Organization of Long-Range Connectivity in the Mouse Brain.Cell. 2019; 179: 268-281.e13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed inputs to PCG that originated from multiple brain areas associated with ingestive behaviors (Figures 1H–1K). Based on these results, we investigated the periLC and surrounding sites for a role in regulating food and water consumption. The periLC primarily contains glutamatergic (Vglut2-expressing) neurons, and they are flanked by GABAergic (Vgat-expressing) neurons in the LDT and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing noradrenergic neurons in the LC (Figure S2A). Moreover, Vglut2 is not expressed in LC noradrenergic neurons (Figure S2A). Based on our HSV experiments, we examined non-noradrenergic LCVGLUT2 and periLCVGLUT2 neurons (hereafter referred to as periLCVGLUT2 neurons) using chemogenetic and optogenetic perturbations during eating and drinking. Chemogenetic inhibition of periLCVGLUT2 neurons by PSAM4-GlyR and uPSEM792 (Magnus et al., 2019Magnus C.J. Lee P.H. Bonaventura J. Zemla R. Gomez J.L. Ramirez M.H. Hu X. Galvan A. Basu J. Michaelides M. Sternson S.M. Ultrapotent chemogenetics for research and potential clinical applications.Science. 2019; 364: eaav5282PubMed Google Scholar) in ad-libitum-fed and -hydrated mice significantly increased consumption of both grain food pellets and sugar pellets during the light period, which is a time during which mice normally eat little (Figures 2A–2D, S2B, and S2C; see STAR Methods). Chemogenetic inhibition of periLCVGLUT2 neurons did not reliably elicit water consumption (Figure S2D). Using a closed-loop place preference assay, we found that inhibition of periLCVGLUT2 neurons conditioned place preference that was sustained in a post-conditioning test in the absence of neuron activity perturbations, and this was not observed in enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) control mice (Figures 2E–2G, S2E, and S2F). Optogenetic activation of periLCVGLUT2 neurons reduced food intake (Figure 2H) and elicited avoidance during closed-loop place preference (Figure 2I). These gain- or loss-of-function perturbations did not significantly alter locomotion or the number of entries to the light-paired side in archaerhodopsin-expressing (ArchT) mice or channelrhodopsin-2-expressing (ChR2) mice (Figures S2G–S2J). However, mice did not readily perform operant self-inhibition of periLCVGLUT2 neurons in a nose-poking task (Figure 2J), indicating that this cell population does not reinforce specific actions. Taken together, these experiments show that inhibition of periLCVGLUT2 neurons increases food intake and is rewarding, whereas activation has the opposite effect. Notably, this is different than the AGRP neurons, which increase food seeking but mediate the unpleasant aspects of hunger (Betley et al., 2015Betley J.N. Xu S. Cao Z.F.H. Gong R. Magnus C.J. Yu Y. Sternson S.M. Neurons for hunger and thirst transmit a negative-valence teaching signal.Nature. 2015; 521: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). To determine the natural dynamics of neurons in the PCG during motivated behavior, we developed an approach for in vivo calcium imaging of this brain region in freely moving mice during feeding and drinking by using a head-mounted miniature microscope and an implanted gradient index (GRIN) lens. Areas in the PCG are challenging targets for freely moving deep-brain calcium imaging because they are close to the cerebral ventricle, which is not stable during movement. Also, this area is overlaid by the confluence of the transverse sinus and the sagittal sinus, which is critical for cerebral blood flow and damaging these blood vessels with the GRIN lens is fatal. We developed methods to mechanically displace the confluence during GRIN lens implantation (see STAR Methods), but we consistently observed large amplitude movement of brain tissue under the GRIN lens during locomotion or other activity (Figure 3A), which was incompatible with motion correction such that we were unable to detect reliable changes of individual neuronal calcium signals during behavior (Video S1). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI5YTU1NTRjYjI3ZGI2NjUyYTA0NzUzODAyZmFkMDgzYSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjMzMzQ4NTIzfQ.dX4N8eHjTh4dCbXj-UU4q31bPeBVKpaVXt9jEXPpD-_KGCemuOJhP4bbVBUtwcscKuVozYSzKDxQHQUHp7p4-UOpbikifVGOs7seElAwiWv6pZyd-ggnjSvkb1M9s7AvLPdhPSRA0kREO9csFCnumOvz2uuc2C6qZf4hsiOJCjaGfsoWbAY3yQfWmztKEJ07q04u6SqXRHgBOuDM2SvKfuybxN-iabm3pXw5VGyhJ-GdA5zCOWz6ZM6zmbW8omwsE55qJsJ7CZP04xMObT0SvaMaVI8RBaHzTrYczDxygKmlD33mOl4xFmfkQ4J_EVSqQQ9ZaU-7xWtsZaB5mTZ1cg Download .mp4 (2.44 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1Example In Vivo Calcium Imaging of periLCVGLUT2 Neurons in a Freely Moving Mouse without Tungsten Wire Anchoring (3× Speed), Related to Figure 3A Motion correction using procedures described in the STAR Methods did not produce successful alignment across imaging frames for unanchored GRIN lens placements in the periLC. We overcame this technical challenge by drawing inspiration from optrode recordings. We attached polyimide tubes to the GRIN lens through which we inserted tungsten wires to lock the underlying tissue into place (Figures 3B and S3A). The extended tungsten wires secured the imaging area and improved image stability. The recorded image time series was then suitable for small amplitude motion correction by using image registration (Figure 3B; Videos S2 and S3; see STAR Methods).

Motion corrected video is also shown. We used Vglut2 (Slc17a6)-IRES-Cre (Figure S3B) and Gad2-IRES-Cre mice with targeted Cre-dependent AAV injections to label glutamatergic neurons or GABAergic neurons, respectively, in the dorsolateral part of the PCG with GCaMP6f. PeriLCVGLUT2 neurons were modulated by consumption of food pellets or palatable liquid food (Ensure) (Figures S3C and S3D). These neurons were selective for consumption and were only weakly modulated by false food (wood block) or social interaction with the opposite sex (Figures S3C and S3D). In contrast, Gad2-expressing inhibitory neurons, which were in the adjacent LDT (300 μm medial to periLC), were not selective for consumption and decreased activity when FD mice were presented with either a food pellet or a false food (Figure S3E). Further investigation indicated that a subset of LDTGAD2 neuron activity was increased during locomotion (Figure S3E, bottom), rearing, or grooming (Figure S3F). Our imaging results indicate that LDT Fos-IR (Figure 1D) was likely an indirect consequence of elevated foraging locomotor activity associated with activating AGRP and SFONOS1 populations (Krashes et al., 2011Krashes M.J. Koda S. Ye C. Rogan S.C. Adams A.C. Cusher D.S. Maratos-Flier E. Roth B.L. Lowell B.B. Rapid, reversible activation of AgRP neurons drives feeding behavior in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 1424-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). These results highlight the importance of temporally precise in vivo imaging over immediate early gene analysis to establish selective involvement in ingestive behaviors instead of indirect effects such as from locomotor activity. This also restricts consumption-modulated neurons to the periLC region. Based on these observations, we focused on periLCVGLUT2 neurons across different phases of eating and drinking behavior (Figure 1A). We first investigated stimuli that are known to modulate AGRP neurons. To test the effect of hormonal signals of energy deficit, we injected ghrelin, which activates AGRP neurons within 2 min (Betley et al., 2015Betley J.N. Xu S. Cao Z.F.H. Gong R. Magnus C.J. Yu Y. Sternson S.M. Neurons for hunger and thirst transmit a negative-valence teaching signal.Nature. 2015; 521: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar; Chen et al., 2015Chen Y. Lin Y.C. Kuo T.W. Knight Z.A. Sensory detection of food rapidly modulates arcuate feeding circuits.Cell. 2015; 160: 829-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), but ghrelin did not significantly affect periLCVGLUT2 neuron activity (Figures S3G and S3H). Next, we examined neural activity during cue-conditioned delivery of a small, fixed volume (3 μL) of palatable Ensure by using a motorized lick spout that was equipped with capacitive lick detection (Figure 3C; Video S4). In ad-libitum-fed mice, periLCVGLUT2 neurons showed responses during the consumption period (29% significantly inhibited, 25% significantly activated; Figures 3D and 3G). PeriLCVGLUT2 neurons also responded similarly during ingestion of moderate palatability liquid food by hungry mice (FD) (Figure 3E) as well as water consumption in a strong thirst state under water restriction (WR) (Figure 3F), with similar proportions of significantly modulated neurons under each condition (Figure 3G). Notably, many of the neurons that responded to food in hunger were also significantly modulated by water in thirst (Figure S3I; see STAR Methods). However, periLCVGLUT2 neurons were not modulated by the food-predictive auditory cue (Figures 3H and 3I). The lack of robust responding to a conditioned stimulus is different than that for AGRP neurons, which reduce their activity in the presence of food-predicting cues (Betley et al., 2015Betley J.N. Xu S. Cao Z.F.H. Gong R. Magnus C.J. Yu Y. Sternson S.M. Neurons for hunger and thirst transmit a negative-valence teaching signal.Nature. 2015; 521: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Instead, the activated or inhibited neural responses of periLCVGLUT2 neurons were typically maintained throughout the consumption period (Figure 3J). These responses increased (or decreased) following the first lick and quickly reached a plateau (Figure 3K). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJhN2Y0MjJlNjZjOGNhNjEzMzc1OTM3M2FlODU3NmRhYiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjMzMzQ4NTI0fQ.cGNoIppbo-3JVPNssHL0KZQPMQYlcwmZcCbmmVIcR3Bc8buoLL1KL2AUde9vEtDGH9sNYGcv7nqxExosMFOWMIGdTty0Xtz0x2uBMXYjH5pRvJ_VRk6EVYbxVVNv7VMzqXISgssYcbYMTJ_FLLrOgAEp2FbjAoZPLL3anVF80rwqXU1R9G65n4LtgG85qRzkNl69xTRwZ9TIPHXUc2VLZiq1FfB_BbkJhgvPSMIhG7ZD-l5LcuikiTDBsWu9IcVKFG4ZcC4ILtQNZ9sLkqf9wz0ofske_B2KeXnU7YnrFYQPYluaY0PNtcBI9skq_QKwY_3pc8xsAfffFP7lsRzVXQ Download .mp4 (2.96 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S4Example In Vivo Calcium Dynamics of PeriLCVGLUT2 Neurons during Ensure Consumption (2× Speed), Related to Figure 3D Motion corrected in vivo imaging video was displayed after rolling-ball background subtraction in the left panel. The right panel is the corresponding CNMF-E analysis of neuronal calcium dynamics false colored to highlight activated and inhibited neuron responses. We also performed imaging during free-access, self-paced feeding trials without an auditory cue in which the food spout was always available. In these experiments, periLCVGLUT2 neurons were also most responsive during the consummatory phase (Figure S3J), but we did observe weak modulation during approach to the food spout (Figure S3J). This observation was most evident for the consumption-activated periLCVGLUT2 neurons, which showed a small decrease followed by an increase that preceded the first lick (Figure S3J, right). The mean response for consumption-inhibited periLCVGLUT2 neurons showed a slight increase during approach that decreased to the baseline level at the onset of the first lick, but these neurons were primarily modulated during consumption (Figure S3J). Thus, periLCVGLUT2 neuron responses were largest during consumption of both food and water, indicating that they are primarily involved in the consummatory phase of ingestive behaviors. In addition, we considered a potential role for periLCVGLUT2 neurons in short-term termination of consumption. However, during free-access feeding bouts, we did not observe a systematic change in activity before or coinciding with cessation of consumption (Figure S3K). Because periLCVGLUT2 neuron responses track consumption duration in cue-conditioned trials, we also examined the relationship of periLCVGLUT2 neuron responses to consumption duration in self-paced feeding bouts during free-access trials from energy deficit to satiety (Figure S3L). In this experiment, we interleaved cue-conditioned small-volume (3 μL) consumption trials for classification of periLCVGLUT2 neurons as “activated” or “i"

Specifically, we 1) evaluate the basic reproduction number of the virus, 2) determine the peak of the infection and the spread-out period of the disease, and 3) simulate the interventions of public health authorities. Data used in this study is obtained from the Cameroonian Public Health Ministry. The results suggest that over the identified period, the reproduction number of COVID-19 in Cameroon is about 1.5, and the peak of the infection should have occurred at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected. Furthermore, the implementation of efficient public health policies could help flatten the epidemic curve."

Design Retrospective, Comparative, Observational study. Setting Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Salerno, Italy. Methods Ninety one eyes of 91 patients previously treated with Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK) or Laser-Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) that underwent phacoemulsification and IOL implantation in the capsular bag were analyzed. For 68 eyes it was possible to zero out the Mean Errors (ME) for each formula and for selected IOL models, in order to eliminate the bias of the lens factor (A-Costant). Main outcome, measured in this study, was the median absolute error (MedAE) of the refraction prediction. Results In the sample with ME zeroed (68 eyes) both R Factor and ALxK methods resulted in MedAE of 0.67 D. For R Factor 33 eyes (48.53%) reported a refractive error <0.5D, and 53 eyes (77.94%) reported a refractive error <1D, For ALxK method, 32 eyes (47.06%) reported a refractive error <0.5 D, and 53 eyes (77.94%) reported a refractive error <1 D. ALMA method, reported a MedAE of 0.55 D, and an higher number of patients with a refractive error <0.5 D (35 eyes, 51.47%), and with a refractive error <1 D (54 eyes, 79.41%). Conclusions Based on the results obtained from this study, ALMA method can improve R Factor and ALxK methods. This improvement is confirmed both by zeroing the mean error and without zeroing it."

Innovative technologies may offer a means to target deepwater populations and allow for the development of a lionfish trap fishery, but the removal efficiency and potential environmental impacts of lionfish traps have not been evaluated. We tested a collapsible, non-containment trap (the ‘Gittings trap’) near artificial reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico. A total of 327 lionfish and 28 native fish (four were species protected with regulations) recruited (i.e., were observed within the trap footprint at the time of retrieval) to traps during 82 trap sets, catching 144 lionfish and 29 native fish (one more than recruited, indicating detection error). Lionfish recruitment was highest for single (versus paired) traps deployed <15 m from reefs with a 1-day soak time, for which mean lionfish and native fish recruitment per trap were approximately 5 and 0.1, respectively. Lionfish from traps were an average of 19 mm or 62 grams larger than those caught spearfishing. Community impacts from Gittings traps appeared minimal given that recruitment rates were >10X higher for lionfish than native fishes and that traps did not move on the bottom during two major storm events, although further testing will be necessary to test trap movement with surface floats. Additional research should also focus on design and operational modifications to improve Gittings trap deployment success (68% successfully opened on the seabed) and reduce lionfish escapement (56% escaped from traps upon retrieval). While removal efficiency for lionfish demonstrated by traps (12–24%) was far below that of spearfishing, Gittings traps appear suitable for future development and testing on deepwater natural reefs, which constitute >90% of the region’s reef habitat."

This retrospective study investigated the association between survival and clinicopathological characteristics and histological grades of 2535 patients with OSCC. Additionally, the present study aimed to compare the predictive abilities of histological grades with other common prognostic factors. The enrolled patients were divided into three groups by two experienced pathologists into well-differentiated, moderately differentiated, and poorly differentiated groups, according to the WHO classification. Finally, we designed an observational, retrospective study based on the histological grading of tumors to compare their clinicopathological characteristics and conducted survival analysis among the three groups. Advanced tumor stage was diagnosed in 23.9%, 44.0%, and 55.1% of patients with grades 1–3 OSCC, respectively. By T status, T3 or T4 tumors were found in approximately 22%, 34%, and 40% of patients with grades 1–3 OSCC, respectively. By N status, lymph node metastases were found in 6.1%, 29.3%, and 45.9% of patients with grades 1–3 OSCC, respectively. Thus, significant survival differences were observed based on different OSCC histological grades. Meanwhile, in the multivariate (adjusted) analysis, N1 and N2 stages, extranodal spread, and poor differentiation were associated with a higher recurrence risk than the other common prognostic factors. In conclusion, 5% of patients in our study presented with poorly differentiated OSCC at diagnosis. Furthermore, grade 3 OSCC has worse prognosis and is more aggressive than grades 1 and 2 OSCC. In the future, we should focus on modifying individual therapy for poorly differentiated OSCC to achieve improved outcomes."

The concept of ""more efficiency with less fertilizer input"" has been proposed and is urgently needed in current agriculture. Application of chemical fertilizer combined with organic manure (OM) could be a solution for soil protection and sustainable production of dry-land maize (Zea mays. L). Field research over three consecutive years on the Loess Plateau of China was conducted to evaluate the integrated effects of chemical fertilizer strategies and additional OM input on soil nutrients availability and water use in maize. The results showed that, after harvest, soil bulk density decreased significantly with OM application, concomitant with 11.9, 18.7 and 97.8% increases in topsoil total nitrogen, organic matter, and available phosphorus contents, respectively, compared with those under equal chemical NPK input. Water use in the 1.0-1.5 m soil profile was improved, therefore, the soil conditions were better for maize root growth, leaf area and shoot biomass of individual maize plants increased significantly with OM application. Optimized NPK strategies increased grain yield and water use efficiency by 18.5 and 20.6%, respectively, compared to only chemical NP input. Furthermore, additional OM input promoted yield and water use efficiency by 8.9 and 5.8%, respectively. Addition of OM promotes sustainable soil and maize grain productivity as well as friendly soil environmental management of dry land farming."

CMV-DNA kinetics according to antiviral therapy were investigated. Three hundred twenty-eight paired samples from 42 episodes of CMV infection and 157 paired samples from 26 episodes of EBV infection were analyzed by a single commercial molecular method approved by regulatory agencies for both matrices. CMV-DNAemia followed different kinetics in WB and plasma. In the descending phase of infection, a slower decay of viral load and a higher percentage of CMV-DNA positive samples were observed in plasma versus WB. In the 72.4% of patients receiving antiviral therapy, monitoring with plasma CMV-DNAemia versus WB CMV-DNAemia could delay treatment interruption by 7-14 days. Discontinuation of therapy based on WB monitoring did not result in relapsed infection in any patients. Highly different EBV-DNA kinetics in WB and plasma were observed due to lower positivity in plasma; EBV positive samples with a quantitative result in both blood compartments were observed in only 11.5% of cases. Our results emphasize the potential role of WB as specimen type for post-KT surveillance of both infections for disease prevention and management."

Genetic variants spanning eight NAFLD risk or ALT-associated loci (LYPLAL1, GCKR, HSD17B13, TRIB1, PPP1R3B, ERLIN1, TM6SF2, PNPLA3) were tested for NAFLD associations with sensitivity analyses adjusting for metabolic risk factors and alcohol consumption. A manual EHR review assessed performance characteristics of the NAFLD phenotype with imaging and biopsy data as gold standards. Genetic associations with advanced fibrosis were explored using FIB4, NAFLD Fibrosis Score and platelet counts.Among 322,259 MVP participants, 19% met non-invasive criteria for NAFLD. Trans-ethnic meta-analysis replicated associations with previously reported genetic variants in all but LYPLAL1 and GCKR loci (P<6x10-3), without attenuation when adjusted for metabolic risk factors and alcohol consumption. At the previously reported LYPLAL1 locus, the established genetic variant did not appear to be associated with NAFLD, however the regional association plot showed a significant association with NAFLD 279kb downstream. In the EHR validation, the ALT-based NAFLD phenotype yielded a positive predictive value 0.89 and 0.84 for liver biopsy and abdominal imaging, respectively (inter-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa = 0.98)). HSD17B13 and PNPLA3 loci were associated with advanced fibrosis.We validate a simple, non-invasive ALT-based NAFLD phenotype using EHR data by leveraging previously established NAFLD risk-associated genetic polymorphisms."
https://openalex.org/W3081037868,"Human papillomaviruses 16 (HPV16) is the primary causative agent of cervical cancer (CC). E6 oncoprotein plays a crucial role in cervical carcinogenesis and commonly cause the dysregulation of the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression. However, the biological function of lncRNAs in HPV16-related CC remains largely unexplored. In the present study HPV16 E6-induced differential expression of lncRNAs, miRNA, and mRNA were identified using microarray-based analysis and verified in tumor r cell lines and tumor tissues, and the function of lncRNA in CC was investigated in vitro and in vivo. We found that an lncRNA, named GABPB1-AS1, was significantly upregulated in HPV16-positive CC tissues and cell lines. GABPB1-AS1 expression in HPV16-positive CC tissues was positively associated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and FIGO stage. High expression of GABPB1-AS1 was correlated with a poor prognosis for HPV16-positive CC patients. Functionally, E6-induced GABPB1-AS1 overexpression facilitated CC cells proliferation and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, GABPB1-AS1 acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR-519e-5p, resulting in the de-repression of its target gene Notch2 which is well known as an oncogene. Therefore, GABPB1-AS1 functioned as a tumor activator in CC pathogenesis by binding to miR-519e-5p and destroying its tumor suppressive function. Collectively, current results demonstrate that GABPB1-AS1 is associated with CC progression, and may be a promising biomarker or target for the clinical management of CC."
https://openalex.org/W3080417490,"Power declines at a greater rate during ageing and is more relevant for functional deterioration than either loss of maximum strength or muscle mass. Human movement typically consists of stretch-shortening cycle action. Therefore, plyometric exercises, using an eccentric phase quickly followed by a concentric phase to optimize power production, should resemble daily function more than traditional resistance training, which primarily builds force production capacity in general. However, it is unclear whether older adults can sustain such high-impact training. This study compared the effects of plyometric exercise (PLYO) on power, force production, jump and functional performance to traditional resistance training (RT) and walking (WALK) in older men. Importantly, feasibility was investigated. Forty men (69.5 ± 3.9 years) were randomized to 12-weeks of PLYO (N = 14), RT (N = 12) or WALK (N = 14). Leg press one-repetition maximum (1-RM), leg-extensor isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and rate of force development (RFD), jump and functional performance were evaluated pre- and post-intervention. One subject in RT (low back pain) and three in PLYO (2 muscle strains, 1 knee pain) dropped out. Adherence to (91.2 ± 4.4%) and acceptability of (≥ 7/10) PLYO was high. 1-RM improved more in RT (25.0 ± 10.0%) and PLYO (23.0 ± 13.6%) than in WALK (2.9 ± 13.7%) (p < 0.001). PLYO improved more on jump height, jump power, contraction time of jumps and stair climbing performance compared to WALK and/or RT (p < 0.05). MVC improved in RT only (p = 0.028) and RFD did not improve (p > 0.05). To conclude, PLYO is beneficial over RT for improving power, jump and stair climbing performance without compromising gains in strength. This form of training seems feasible, but contains an inherent higher risk for injuries, which should be taken into account when designing programs for older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3081314059,"Introduction From late 2014 through 2015, Scott County, Indiana faced an HIV outbreak triggered by opioid abuse and transition to injection drug use. Investigating the origins, risk factors, and responses related to this outbreak is critical to inform future surveillance, interventions, and policymaking. In response, this retrospective infoveillance study identifies and characterizes user-generated messages related to opioid abuse, heroin injection drug use, and HIV status using natural language processing (NLP) among Twitter users in Indiana during the period of this HIV outbreak. Materials and methods Our study consisted of two phases: data collection and processing, and data analysis. We collected Indiana geolocated tweets from the public Twitter API using Amazon Web Services EC2 instances filtered for geocoded messages in the immediate pre and post period of the outbreak. In the data analysis phase we applied an unsupervised machine learning approach using NLP called the Biterm Topic Model (BTM) to identify tweets related to opioid, heroin/injection, and HIV behavior and then examined these messages for HIV risk-related topics that could be associated with the outbreak. Results More than 10 million geocoded tweets occurring in Indiana during the immediate pre and post period of the outbreak were collected for analysis. Using BTM, we identified 1350 tweets thought to be relevant to the outbreak and then confirmed 358 tweets using human annotation. The most prevalent themes identified were tweets related to self-reported abuse of illicit and prescription drugs, opioid use disorder, self-reported HIV status, and public sentiment regarding the outbreak. Geospatial analysis found that these messages clustered in population dense areas outside of the outbreak, including Indianapolis and neighboring Clark County. Discussion This infoveillance study characterized the social media conversations of communities in Indiana in the pre and post period of the 2015 HIV outbreak. Behavioral themes detected reflect discussion about risk factors related to HIV transmission stemming from opioid and heroin abuse for priority populations, and also help identify community attitudes that could have motivated or detracted the use of HIV prevention methods, along with helping identify factors that can impede access to prevention services. Conclusions Infoveillance approaches, such as the analysis conducted in this study, represent a possibly strategy to detect “signal” of the emergence of risk factors associated with an outbreak though may be limited in their scope and generalizability. Our results, in conjunction with other forms of public health surveillance, can leverage the growing ubiquity of social media platforms to better detect opioid-related HIV risk knowledge, attitudes and behavior, as well as inform future prevention efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3081435517,"Background Paro and other robot animals can improve wellbeing for older adults and people with dementia, through reducing depression, agitation and medication use. However, nursing and care staff we contacted expressed infection control concerns. Little related research has been published. We assessed (i) how microbiologically contaminated robot animals become during use by older people within a care home and (ii) efficacy of a cleaning procedure. Methods This study had two stages. In stage one we assessed microbial load on eight robot animals after interaction with four care home residents, and again following cleaning by a researcher. Robot animals provided a range of shell-types, including fur, soft plastic, and solid plastic. Stage two involved a similar process with two robot animals, but a care staff member conducted cleaning. The cleaning process involved spraying with anti-bacterial product, brushing fur-type shells, followed by vigorous top-to-tail cleaning with anti-bacterial wipes on all shell types. Two samples were taken from each of eight robots in stage one and two robots in stage two (20 samples total). Samples were collected using contact plate stamping and evaluated using aerobic colony count and identification (gram stain, colony morphology, coagulase agglutination). Colony counts were measured by colony forming units per square centimetre (CFU/cm2). Results Most robots acquired microbial loads well above an acceptable threshold of 2.5 CFU/cm2 following use. The bacteria identified were micrococcus species, coagulase negative staphylococcus, diptheriods, aerobic spore bearers, and staphylococcus aureus, all of which carry risk for human health. For all devices the CFU/cm2 reduced to well within accepted limits following cleaning by both researcher and care staff member. Conclusions Companion robots will acquire significant levels of bacteria during normal use. The simple cleaning procedure detailed in this study reduced microbial load to acceptable levels in controlled experiments. Further work is needed in the field and to check the impact on the transmission of viruses."
https://openalex.org/W3080588227,"The zinc-finger protein ZBTB20 regulates development and metabolism in multiple systems, and is essential for postnatal survival in mice. However, its potential role in the cardiovascular system remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that ZBTB20 is critically involved in the regulation of cardiac contractility and blood pressure in mice. At the age of 16 days, the relatively healthy Zbtb20-null mice exhibited hypotension without obvious change of heart rate or other evidence for heart failure. Moreover, Zbtb20 deletion led to a marked reduction in heart size, left ventricular wall thickness, and cell size of cardiomyocytes, which was largely proportional to the decreased body growth. Notably, echocardiographic and hemodynamic analyses showed that cardiac contractility was greatly impaired in the absence of ZBTB20. Mechanistically, ZBTB20 deficiency decreased cardiac ATP contents, and compromised the enzyme activity of mitochondrial complex I in heart as well as L-type calcium current density in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the developmental activation of some mitochondrial function-related genes was significantly attenuated in Zbtb20-null myocardium, which included Hspb8, Ckmt2, Cox7a1, Tfrc, and Ogdhl. Put together, these results suggest that ZBTB20 plays a crucial role in the regulation of heart development, energy metabolism, and contractility."

Here, we found that ULK1/ATG1, an autophagy-related protein, is highly expressed in the FCs of the Chagas-Disease vector Rhodnius prolixus, and that parental RNAi silencing of ULK1/ATG1 results in oocytes with abnormal chorion ultrastructure and FCs presenting expanded rough ER membranes as well as increased expression of the ER chaperone BiP3, both indicatives of ER stress. Silencing of LC3/ATG8, another essential autophagy protein, did not replicate the ULK1/ATG1 phenotypes, whereas silencing of SEC16A, a known partner of the noncanonical ULK1/ATG1 function in the ER exit sites phenocopied the silencing of ULK1/ATG1. Our findings point to a cooperated function of ULK1/ATG1 and SEC16A in the FCs to complete choriogenesis and provide additional in vivo phenotype-based evidence to the literature of the role of ULK1/ATG1 in the ER in a professional secretory cell."

Then, the 3D U-Net convolutional neural network model with a multiscale feature structure is built. The network model structure is subsequently fine-tuned by the transfer learning method based on weight, and the optimal parameters are selected in the network model. Finally, datasets are extracted to train the fine-tuned 3D U-Net network model to detect pulmonary nodules. The five-fold cross-validation method is used to obtain the experimental results for the LUNA16 and TIANCHI17 datasets. The experimental results show that the scheme not only has obvious advantages in the detection of medium and large-sized nodules but also has an accuracy rate of more than 70% for the detection of small-sized nodules. The scheme provides automatic and accurate detection of pulmonary nodules that reduces the overfitting rate and training time and improves the efficiency of the algorithm. It can assist doctors in the diagnosis of lung cancer and can be extended to other medical image detection and recognition fields."
https://openalex.org/W3081097019,"This study aimed to investigate the association of sleep duration and quality with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) among middle-aged and elderly Koreans. Among a total of 74,867 participants (25,069 men and 49,798 women) recruited for the Health Examinees (HEXA) study, adjusted geometric means of hs-CRP level were compared across categories of sleep duration (<6, 6–7, 8–9, and ≥10 hours) and sleep quality (difficulty in initiating sleep and maintaining sleep) using ANCOVA models. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for elevated hs-CRP (>3 mg/L) associated with sleep characteristics were estimated using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models. Men who slept ≥10 hours per day were significantly associated with elevated hs-CRP (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.11–1.95). Whereas in women, difficulty in initiating sleep (OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.04–1.57 for “Always”), and maintaining sleep was significantly associated with elevated hs-CRP levels (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.02–1.26 for “Often”; OR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.97–1.28 for “Always”). Additionally, women who experienced poor sleep quality presented an elevated level of hs-CRP (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.03–1.23). Our findings suggest that excessive sleep duration and poor sleep quality are significantly associated with the elevated inflammatory marker, specifically hs-CRP. Further research is needed to examine the effect of sleep interventions focused on these factors."
https://openalex.org/W3080152561,"The human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis targets epithelial cells lining the genital mucosa. We observed that infection of various cell types, including fibroblasts and epithelial cells resulted in the formation of unusually stable and mature focal adhesions that resisted disassembly induced by the myosin II inhibitor, blebbistatin. Superresolution microscopy revealed in infected cells the vertical displacement of paxillin and focal adhesion kinase from the signaling layer of focal adhesions, whereas vinculin remained in its normal position within the force transduction layer. The candidate type III effector TarP, which localized to focal adhesions during infection and when expressed ectopically, was sufficient to mimic both the reorganization and blebbistatin-resistant phenotypes. These effects of TarP, including its localization to focal adhesions, required a post-invasion interaction with the host protein vinculin through a specific domain at the C terminus of TarP. This interaction is repurposed from an actin-recruiting and -remodeling complex to one that mediates nanoarchitectural and dynamic changes of focal adhesions. The consequence of Chlamydia-stabilized focal adhesions was restricted cell motility and enhanced attachment to the extracellular matrix. Thus, via a novel mechanism, Chlamydia inserts TarP within focal adhesions to alter their organization and stability.

Bacterial infection of mucosal epithelial cells triggers the antimicrobial defense strategy of cell exfoliation and apoptosis induction (1Kim M. Ogawa M. Mimuro H. Sasakawa C. Reinforcement of epithelial cell adhesion to basement membrane by a bacterial pathogen as a new infectious stratagem.Virulence. 2010; 1 (21178415): 52-5510.4161/viru.1.1.10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The controlled extrusion of damaged host cells and colonizing pathogens requires the degradation of cell adhesion factors. In epithelial cells, focal adhesions and hemidesmosomes are primarily responsible for attachment to the extracellular matrix, and their assembly and turnover are exquisitely regulated at multiple levels, by kinases, phosphatases, protein-protein interactions, internalization of components, and degradation (2Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. Structure and function of hemidesmosomes: more than simple adhesion complexes.J. Invest.

Disruption of one or more of these regulatory processes alters the adhesion dynamics and properties of the cells. One strategy employed by bacteria to neutralize exfoliation relies on the precise targeting of one or more components of the focal adhesion proteome. The best-characterized example is that of Shigella, which neutralizes epithelial extrusion to colonize the epithelium efficiently (6Kim M. Ogawa M. Fujita Y. Yoshikawa Y. Nagai T. Koyama T. Nagai S. Lange A. Fässler R. Sasakawa C. Bacteria hijack integrin-linked kinase to stabilize focal adhesions and block cell detachment.Nature. 2009; 459 (19489119): 578-58210.1038/nature07952Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It does so by delivering the OspE effector by the type III secretion system. This protein reinforces host cell adherence to the basement membrane by interacting with integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the focal adhesome (5Zaidel-Bar R. Itzkovitz S. Ma'ayan A. Iyengar R. Geiger B. Functional atlas of the integrin adhesome.Nat.

A consequence of the OspE-ILK interaction is an increased surface expression of β1-integrin, which in turn promotes focal adhesion (FA) assembly. In addition, the OspE-ILK complex stabilizes the FAs by reducing phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at a functionally important Tyr-397 residue. Inhibition of this phosphorylation event induces FA disassembly (6Kim M. Ogawa M. Fujita Y. Yoshikawa Y. Nagai T. Koyama T. Nagai S. Lange A. Fässler R. Sasakawa C. Bacteria hijack integrin-linked kinase to stabilize focal adhesions and block cell detachment.Nature. 2009; 459 (19489119): 578-58210.1038/nature07952Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some EPEC and EHEC strains, as well as Citrobacter rodentium, possess the effector EspO, which shares strong homology with OspE (7Vossenkämper A. Macdonald T.T. Marchès O. Always one step ahead: how pathogenic bacteria use the type III secretion system to manipulate the intestinal mucosal immune system.J. Inflamm. 2011; 8 (21539730): 1110.1186/1476-9255-8-11Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8Morita-Ishihara T. Miura M. Iyoda S. Izumiya H. Watanabe H. Ohnishi M. Terajima J.

As such, it is conceivable that these pathogens also reinforce adherence of the infected epithelial cells to secure an infectious foothold. The EspZ effector of EPEC and EHEC has been shown to reduce cell death and detachment in vitro (9Shames S.R. Deng W. Guttman J.A. de Hoog C.L. Li Y. Hardwidge P.R. Sham H.P. Vallance B.A. Foster L.J. Finlay B.B. The pathogenic E. coli type III effector EspZ interacts with host CD98 and facilitates host cell prosurvival signalling.Cell.

EspZ binds the transmembrane glycoprotein CD98 and enhances its effect on β1-integrin signaling and cell survival via activation of FAK (9Shames S.R. Deng W. Guttman J.A. de Hoog C.L. Li Y. Hardwidge P.R. Sham H.P. Vallance B.A. Foster L.J. Finlay B.B. The pathogenic E. coli type III effector EspZ interacts with host CD98 and facilitates host cell prosurvival signalling.Cell.

It is possible that EspO and EspZ may cooperate to confer enhanced adhesion of the host epithelial cells to the extracellular matrix. Finally, through interaction with human carcino-embryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules, bacterial pathogens such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Hemophilus influenzae can activate β1-integrin signaling and inhibit epithelial cell detachment (1Kim M. Ogawa M. Mimuro H. Sasakawa C. Reinforcement of epithelial cell adhesion to basement membrane by a bacterial pathogen as a new infectious stratagem.Virulence. 2010; 1 (21178415): 52-5510.4161/viru.1.1.10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Despite numerous examples of pathogens manipulating host cell adhesion, the details of these mechanisms remain uncharacterized. Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular pathogens that are distinguished by their biphasic developmental cycle that alters between the infectious elementary body (EB), and the replicative, but noninfectious reticulate body (RB). At late time points, the noninfectious RBs convert back to EBs to produce infectious particles for the next round of infection. The entire intracellular growth cycle of Chlamydia takes ∼48–96 h and occurs within a membrane-bound inclusion, and most of it is spent in the noninfectious RB form. Thus, it is essential that the adhesion of the infected cells to the epithelium is sustained during chlamydial development to enable the differentiation of the noninfectious RBs to the infectious and stable EBs (10AbdelRahman Y.M. Belland R.J. The chlamydial developmental cycle.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29 (16043254): 949-95910.1016/j.femsre.2005.03.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). This means that Chlamydia must evade a host of antimicrobial defenses, including epithelial extrusion. Previous works by Kumar and Valdivia (11Kumar Y. Valdivia R.H. Reorganization of the host cytoskeleton by the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis.Commun. Integr. Biol. 2008; 1 (19704885): 175-17710.4161/cib.1.2.7146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Heymann et al. (12Heymann J. Rejman Lipinski A. Bauer B. Meyer T.F. Heuer D.

(12Heymann J. Rejman Lipinski A. Bauer B. Meyer T.F. Heuer D. Chlamydia trachomatis infection prevents front-rear polarity of migrating HeLa cells.Cell. Microbiol. 2013; 15 (23351274): 1059-106910.1111/cmi.12114Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) attributed this to the chlamydial inhibition of Golgi polarization that occurs at >24 h post-infection, leading to loss of directional migration (12Heymann J. Rejman Lipinski A. Bauer B. Meyer T.F. Heuer D. Chlamydia trachomatis infection prevents front-rear polarity of migrating HeLa cells.Cell. Microbiol. 2013; 15 (23351274): 1059-106910.1111/cmi.12114Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this report, we offer an alternate and possibly complementary mechanism of FA stabilization, which could lead to an increase of host cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), thus culminating in previously reported loss of motility (11Kumar Y. Valdivia R.H. Reorganization of the host cytoskeleton by the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis.Commun. Integr. Biol. 2008; 1 (19704885): 175-17710.4161/cib.1.2.7146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Heymann J. Rejman Lipinski A. Bauer B. Meyer T.F. Heuer D.

Using quantitative confocal and live-cell imaging and superresolution microscopy, we describe the various Chlamydia infection–dependent changes that occur to FAs consistent with altered cell adhesion, such as increased numbers, enhanced stability, enriched presence of the maturation marker zyxin, resistance to disassembly by the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin, altered molecular organization, and restricted cell migration. We provide evidence implicating the type III secretion system effector TarP, and its interaction with the focal adhesion protein vinculin, in the majority of these adhesion-related characteristics. We show that vinculin and the region of TarP encompassing binding motifs for focal adhesion kinase and vinculin (LD and VBD, respectively) are required for the localization of the effector to focal adhesions and their resistance to blebbistatin-induced disassembly. We demonstrate that TarP-expressing cells have increased numbers of zyxin-positive focal adhesions. Furthermore, interference-photoactivated localization microscopy (iPALM) reveals that TarP displaces focal adhesion kinase and paxillin from their normal position within the integrin signaling layer. We also show that TarP alone was sufficient to restrict cell motility. Overall, the results indicate that Chlamydia has a dedicated mechanism of modulating focal adhesion dynamics through the post-invasion reutilization of TarP and that this process may be linked to the maintenance of Chlamydia infection in a high-turnover tissue site. COS7 cells were infected, and 24 h post-infection (hpi), cells were fixed and prepared for indirect immunofluorescence imaging of paxillin-positive FAs. As shown in Fig. 1A, cells infected with Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2, serovar D, serovar B, Chlamydia caviae GPIC, and Chlamydia muridarum (MoPn) consistently had greater numbers of FAs than mock-infected cells. We further explored the apparent infection-dependent increase in FA numbers using serovar L2 and observed enhanced FA numbers at 8 hpi that increased by 20 hpi. Next, we asked whether the process is pathogen-directed. Specifically, we investigated whether this effect on FAs required de novo protein synthesis by Chlamydia. COS7 cells were infected with C. trachomatis serovar L2 (CtrL2) for the specified duration followed by treatment by the bacterial translation inhibitor, chloramphenicol (Cm). We observed that whereas an 8-h protein synthesis inhibition was not sufficient to prevent the effects on FA number, the 20-h Cm treatment reduced FA numbers of infected cells to the level of mock-infected control (Fig. 1, B and C). The results indicate that the latter phase of focal adhesion alterations requires either the de novo synthesis of new proteins by Chlamydia or replenishment of effectors packaged in the metabolically quiescent EBs. These effectors are delivered by the type III secretion system early in infection, prior to differentiation to the vegetative reticulate body form, when they gain the ability for macromolecular synthesis. This is further supported by our observation that heat-killed bacteria could not increase focal adhesion numbers, indicating that viable chlamydiae are essential to this process (Fig. 1D). The chlamydial type III effector TarP has been implicated in the invasion process during infection of nonphagocytic cells. Specifically, TarP translocation by the elementary bodies contributes to the actin remodeling that is required for uptake of the pathogen (13Clifton D.R. Dooley C.A. Grieshaber S.S. Carabeo R.A.

Interestingly, TarP was also reported to have a role in increased resistance of infected cells to apoptosis, raising the possibility that this effector has post-invasion function (17Mehlitz A.

Consistent with this idea is the continuous presence of the protein throughout infection (18Clifton D.R. Fields K.A. Grieshaber S.S. Dooley C.A. Fischer E.R. Mead D.J. Carabeo R.A. Hackstadt T. A chlamydial type III translocated protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated at the site of entry and associated with recruitment of actin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Carabeo R.A.

In addition, there was sustained presence of TarP translocated to the cytosol as indicated by its reactivity to the anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody under conditions that prevented further synthesis of this protein (i.e. Cm treatment) (Fig. S1). During invasion, TarP localizes to sites of chlamydial adhesion at the plasma membrane (18Clifton D.R. Fields K.A. Grieshaber S.S. Dooley C.A. Fischer E.R. Mead D.J. Carabeo R.A. Hackstadt T.

If TarP has a role post-invasion, we expect TarP to be found at sites where it exerts its function. Immunostaining with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to CtrL2 TarP of infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) revealed specific staining of FAs, in addition to punctae within inclusions, which are likely to be the bacteria (Fig. 2A). Uninfected cells consistently exhibited diffused background immunofluorescence signal, illustrating specificity of the antibody to TarP localized to FAs. We then sought to determine whether ectopically expressed TarP would yield a similar subcellular localization to FAs. TarP and its deletion derivatives shown in Figs. S2 and S3 were tagged as illustrated in Fig. 2B and ectopically expressed in MEFs. TarP has multiple domains that resemble motifs for protein-protein interaction and signaling, including a repeated 50-amino acid domain that is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src family kinases and the Abl kinase, actin-binding domains, a leucine-aspartate (LD) domain (e.g. LD/EXLLXXL) recognized by the FAK, and vinculin-binding domains (VBDs) (13Clifton D.R.

We created various mutant constructs of TarP fused to mTurquoise for heterologous expression in MEFs, as well as a TarP derivative lacking the proline-rich domain (PRD) to minimize nonspecific aggregation of the protein. Transfected cells were counterstained with a mAb to paxillin or FAK to visualize FAs. The extent of TarP localization to focal adhesions was found to correlate with its level of expression, in that higher levels were associated with a greater number of focal adhesions localizing to recombinant TarP. As shown in Fig. 2C, colocalization of TarP with the focal adhesion marker paxillin required the LD and VBD motifs. Note that paxillin localization was observed for both full-length TarP and TarP ΔPRD (Fig. S2). In Fig. S3, we showed that proper localization of TarP to FAs required both the LD and VBD motifs. Mutating or deleting one (e.g. TarP-LD mut (16Thwaites T. Nogueira A.T. Campeotto I. Silva A.P. Grieshaber S.S. Carabeo R.A.

Ectopic expression of TarP or the LDVBD domain led to increased numbers of FAs. Images from the FA localization (Fig. 2C) experiments in COS7 cells were reanalyzed by quantifying the number of focal adhesions per cell in cells transfected with the mTurquoise vector alone, TarP ΔPRD, TarP ΔLDVBD, or LDVBD. Paxillin-positive structures in transfected cells were counted in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health), and the data are illustrated as box-whisker plots in Fig. 2D. We observed statistically significant increases in focal adhesion numbers in cells expressing TarP ΔPRD and LDVBD. These results suggested that the ability of TarP to localize to FAs, which was mediated by the LDVBD domain of TarP, was linked to its effects on FA numbers. We previously reported that the VBD and LD domains were recognized by vinculin and FAK, respectively (16Thwaites T. Nogueira A.T. Campeotto I. Silva A.P. Grieshaber S.S. Carabeo R.A.

They are distinct nonoverlapping domains that interacted with their respective binding partners independently. Therefore, we evaluated whether the loss of either binding partner (e.g. vinculin or FAK) would result in the loss of FA localization. To address the functional relevance of these interactions, albeit in a post-invasion context, the LDVBD construct was expressed in WT, vcl−/− (vinculin), or ptk2−/− (FAK) MEF knockout mutants. We observed FA localization of mTurquoise-LDVBD in WT MEFs, but not in vcl−/− MEFs (Fig. 3A). The loss of FAK did not affect the focal adhesion localization of LDVBD (Fig. 3B). Together, the data indicated that TarP localization to FAs required the host protein vinculin, likely through its interaction with the VBD domain. FAK was dispensable in this regard. The TarP-positive subcellular structures were verified as FAs based on β1-integrin staining using a mAb specific to the conformationally active form of the receptor (Fig. 3C). The LD-dependent FA localization of TarP would suggest a requirement for another host protein that also recognizes this motif, rather than FAK. A marked difference during infection was the increased number of FAs at the interior of the cell as evidenced in Fig. 1 Focal adhesion maturation is associated with movement away from the cell periphery and toward the center (25Smilenov L.B.

https://openalex.org/W3080543706,"Variants implicated in childhood epilepsy have been identified in all four voltage-gated sodium channels that initiate action potentials in the central nervous system. Previous research has focused on the functional effects of particular variants within the most studied of these channels (NaV1.1, NaV1.2 and NaV1.6); however, there have been few comparative studies across channels to infer the impact of mutations in patients with epilepsy. Here we compare patterns of variation in patient and public databases to test the hypothesis that regions of known functional significance within voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels have an increased burden of deleterious variants. We assessed mutational burden in different regions of the Nav channels by (1) performing Fisher exact tests on odds ratios to infer excess variants in domains, segments, and loops of each channel in patient databases versus public “control” databases, and (2) comparing the cumulative distribution of variant sites along DNA sequences of each gene in patient and public databases (i.e., independent of protein structure). Patient variant density was concordant among channels in regions known to play a role in channel function, with statistically significant higher patient variant density in S4-S6 and DIII-DIV and an excess of public variants in SI-S3, DI-DII, DII-DIII. On the other hand, channel-specific patterns of patient burden were found in the NaV1.6 inactivation gate and NaV1.1 S5-S6 linkers, while NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 S4-S5 linkers and S5 segments shared patient variant patterns that contrasted with those in NaV1.1. These different patterns may reflect different roles played by the NaV1.6 inactivation gate in action potential propagation, and by NaV1.1 S5-S6 linkers in loss of function and haploinsufficiency. Interestingly, NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 both lack amino acid substitutions over significantly long stretches in both the patient and public databases suggesting that new mutations in these regions may cause embryonic lethality or a non-epileptic disease phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3081353173,"Endometrial cancer remains the most common gynecological malignancy in the United States. While the loss of the tumor suppressor, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), is well studied in endometrial cancer, recent studies suggest that DICER1, the endoribonuclease responsible for miRNA genesis, also plays a significant role in endometrial adenocarcinoma. Conditional uterine deletion of Dicer1 and Pten in mice resulted in poorly differentiated endometrial adenocarcinomas, which expressed Napsin A and HNF1B (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox B), markers of clear-cell adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinomas were hormone-independent. Treatment with progesterone did not mitigate poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, nor did it affect adnexal metastasis. Transcriptomic analyses of DICER1 deleted uteri or Ishikawa cells revealed unique transcriptomic profiles and global miRNA downregulation. Computational integration of miRNA with mRNA targets revealed deregulated let-7 and miR-16 target genes, similar to published human DICER1-mutant endometrial cancers from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas). Similar to human endometrial cancers, tumors exhibited dysregulation of ephrin-receptor signaling and transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathways. LIM kinase 2 (LIMK2), an essential molecule in p21 signal transduction, was significantly upregulated and represents a novel mechanism for hormone-independent pathogenesis of endometrial adenocarcinoma. This preclinical mouse model represents the first genetically engineered mouse model of poorly differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W3080110770,"Random sampling is an important approach to field vegetation surveys. However, sampling surveys in desert areas are difficult because determining an appropriate quadrat size that represent the sparse and unevenly distributed vegetation is challenging. In this study, we present a methodology for quadrat size optimization based on low-altitude high-precision unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. Using the Daliyaboyi Oasis as our study area, we simulated random sampling and analyzed the frequency distribution and variation in the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) index of the samples. Our results show that quadrats of 50 m × 50 m size are the most representative for sampling surveys in this location. The method exploits UAV technology to rapidly acquire vegetation information and overcomes the shortcomings of traditional methods that rely on labor-intensive fieldwork to collect species-area relationship (SAR) data. Our method presents two major advantages: (1) speed and efficiency stemming from the application of UAV, which also effectively overcomes the difficulties posed in vegetation surveys by the challenging desert climate and terrain; (2) the large sample size enabled by the use of a sampling simulation. Our methodology is thus highly suitable for selecting the optimal quadrat size and making accurate estimates, and can improve the efficiency and accuracy of field vegetation sampling surveys."
https://openalex.org/W3080465618,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is typically treated with chemotherapeutic agents, including carboplatin (Cb), an DNA platinating agent. The O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase gene (MGMT) encodes for the protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (MGMT protein). MGMT protein is involved in DNA repair mechanisms to remove mutagenic and cytotoxic adducts from O6-guanine in DNA. In glioblastoma multiforme, MGMT methylation status is a predictive biomarker for increased response to temozolomide therapy. It has been suggested, that MGMT protein may have relevance for cellular adaptation and could have an influence on resistance to carboplatin therapy. We investigated the influence of MGMT promoter methylation on pathologic complete response and survival of patients with TNBC treated in the neoadjuvant GeparSixto trial. In 174 of 210 available TNBC tumors a valid MGMT promoter methylation status was determined by pyrosequencing of 5 CpG islands. In 21.8%, we detected a mean MGMT promoter methylation >10%. Overall, MGMT promoter methylation was not significantly associated with pathological complete response (pCR) rate. After stratification for the two therapy arms with and without Cb no statistically significant differences in therapy response rates between the two MGMT promoter methylation groups could be observed. Our results show that different MGMT promoter methylation status is not related to different chemotherapy response rates in the TNBC setting in GeparSixto."

This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the cardio-metabolic parameters and SIBO in patients with different degrees of hepatic fibrosis estimated by NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS).Subjects (n = 78) were allocated to three groups: Healthy control (n = 30), NAFLD with low risk of advanced fibrosis (NAFLD-LRAF, n = 17) and NAFLD with a high risk of advanced fibrosis (NAFLD-HRAF, n = 31). Anthropometrics, blood pressure, electrocardiogram and heart rate variability (HRV) were evaluated. Only the NAFLD-LRAF and NAFLD-HRAF groups were submitted to blood biochemical analysis and glucose hydrogen breath tests.The NAFLD-HRAF group had higher age and body mass index when compared to the control and NAFLD-LRAF groups. The prevalence of SIBO in the NAFLD group was 8.33%. The low frequency/high-frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio) was augmented in NAFLD-LRAF (p < 0.05) when compared with control group. NAFLD-HRAF group had a wide QRS complex (p < 0.05) and reduced LF/HF ratio (p < 0.05) compared to the control and NAFLD-LRAF groups. Serum levels of albumin and platelets were more reduced in the NAFLD-HRAF subjects (p < 0.05) than in the NAFLD-LRAF.NAFLD impairs cardiac autonomic function. Greater impairment was found in subjects with a worse degree of hepatic fibrosis estimated by NFS. Hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia were higher in subjects with a worse degree of hepatic fibrosis, whereas prevalence of SIBO positive was similar between the groups."

This study aimed to document rates and causes of entanglement and trends in local haulout abundance for Steller and California sea lions on the north coast of Washington from 2010–2018. We conducted small boat surveys to count sea lions and document entangled individuals. Rates of entanglement and entangling material occurrence were compared with records of stranded individuals on the Washington and Oregon coast and with packing bands recorded during beach debris surveys. The rate of entanglement for California sea lions was 2.13%, almost entirely composed of adult males, with a peak rate during June and July potentially due to some entangled individuals not migrating to their breeding grounds. For Steller sea lions, the rate of entanglement was 0.41%, composed of 77% adults (32.4% male, 63.3% female), 17.1% juveniles, 5.9% unknown age, and no pups. Steller sea lions exhibited a 7.9% ± 3.2 rate of increase in abundance at the study haulouts, which was similar to that seen in California sea lions (7.8% ± 4.2); both increases were greater than the population growth rates observed range-wide despite high rates of entanglement. Most entanglements for both species were classified as packing bands, followed by entanglement scars. Salmon flashers were also prevalent and only occurred from June–September during the local ocean salmon troll fishery. Packing band occurrence in beach debris surveys correlated with packing band entanglements observed on haulouts. However, no packing band entanglements were observed in the stranding record and the rate of stranded animals exhibiting evidence of entanglement was lower than expected, indicating that entanglement survival is higher than previously assumed. Future studies tracking individual entanglement outcomes are needed to develop effective, targeted management strategies."

We sought to understand symptomatic changes across Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) dimensions, and the extent to which such improvement might be associated with risk for readmission. We identified 3,634 individuals with 4,713 hospital admissions to the psychiatric inpatient unit of a large academic medical center between 2010 and 2015. We applied a natural language processing tool to extract estimates of the five RDoC domains to the admission note and discharge summary and calculated the change in each domain. We examined the extent to which symptom domains changed during admission, and their relationship to baseline clinical and sociodemographic features, using linear regression. Symptomatic worsening was rare in the negative valence (0.4%) and positive valence (5.1%) domains, but more common in cognition (25.8%). Most diagnoses exhibited improvement in negative valence, which was associated with significant reduction in readmission risk. Despite generally brief hospital stays, we detected reduction across multiple symptom domains, with greatest improvement in negative symptoms, and greatest probability of worsening in cognitive symptoms. This approach should facilitate investigations of other features or interventions which may influence pace of clinical improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3080576288,"Spatial patterns of coral reef benthic communities vary across a range of broad-scale biogeographical levels to fine-scale local habitat conditions. This study described spatial patterns of coral reef benthic communities spanning across the 536-km coast of Kenya. Thirty-eight reef sites representing different geographical zones within an array of habitats and management levels were assessed by benthic cover, coral genera and coral colony size classes. Three geographical zones were identified along the latitudinal gradient based on their benthic community composition. Hard coral dominated the three zones with highest cover in the south and Porites being the most abundant genus. Almost all 15 benthic variables differed significantly between geographical zones. The interaction of habitat factors and management levels created a localised pattern within each zone. Four habitats were identified based on their similarity in benthic community composition; 1. Deep-Exposed Patch reef in Reserve areas (DEPR), 2. Deep-Exposed Fringing reefs in Unprotected areas (DEFU), 3. Shallow Fringing and Lagoon reefs in Protected and Reserve areas (SFLPR) and 4. Shallow Patch and Channel reefs (SPC). DEPR was found in the north zone only and its benthic community was predominantly crustose coralline algae. DEFU was found in central and south zones mainly dominated by soft corals, Acropora, Montipora, juvenile corals and small colonies of adult corals. SFLPR was dominated by macroalgae and turf algae and was found in north and central zones. SPC was found across all geographical zones with a benthic community dominated by hard corals of mostly large colonies of Porites and Echinopora. The north zone exhibits habitat types that support resistance properties, the south supports recovery processes and central zone acts as an ecological corridor between zones. Identifying habitats with different roles in reef resilience is useful information for marine spatial planning and supports the process of designing effective marine protected areas."
https://openalex.org/W3081503100,"Insects experience a diversity of subtoxic and/or toxic xenobiotics through exposure to pesticides and, in the case of herbivorous insects, through plant defensive compounds in their diets. Many insects are also concurrently exposed to antioxidants in their diets. The impact of dietary antioxidants on the toxicity of xenobiotics in insects is not well understood, in part due to the challenge of developing appropriate systems in which doses and exposure times (of both the antioxidants and the xenobiotics) can be controlled and outcomes can be easily measured. However, in Drosophila melanogaster, a well-established insect model system, both dietary factors and pesticide exposure can be easily controlled. Additionally, the mode of action and xenobiotic metabolism of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a highly persistent neurotoxic organochlorine insecticide that is detected widely in the environment, have been well studied in DDT-susceptible and -resistant strains. Using a glass-vial bioassay system with blue diet as the food source, seven compounds with known antioxidant effects (ascorbic acid, β-carotene, glutathione, α-lipoic acid, melatonin, minocycline, and serotonin) were orally tested for their impact on DDT toxicity across three strains of D. melanogaster: one highly susceptible to DDT (Canton-S), one mildly susceptible (91-C), and one highly resistant (91-R). Three of the antioxidants (serotonin, ascorbic acid, and β-carotene) significantly impacted the toxicity of DDT in one or more strains. Fly strain and gender, antioxidant type, and antioxidant dose all affected the relative toxicity of DDT. Our work demonstrates that dietary antioxidants can potentially alter the toxicity of a xenobiotic in an insect population."
https://openalex.org/W3080625945,"Longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) is an important commercial fruit tree in southern China. The embryogenesis of longan affects the quality and yield of fruit. A large number of alternative splicing events occurs during somatic embryogenesis (SE), which is regulated by serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins. However, the functions of SR proteins in longan are poorly understood. In this study, 21 Dlo-SR gene family members belonging to six subfamilies were identified, among which Dlo-RSZ20a, Dlo-SR30, Dlo-SR17, Dlo-SR53 and Dlo-SR32 were localized in the nucleus, Dlo-RSZ20b, Dlo-RSZ20c, Dlo-RSZ20d, Dlo-SC18, Dlo-RS2Z29, Dlo-SCL41, and Dlo-SR33 were localized in chloroplasts, and Dlo-RS43, Dlo-SC33, Dlo-SC37, Dlo-RS2Z33, Dlo-RS2Z16, Dlo-RS2Z24, Dlo-SCL43, Dlo-SR112, and Dlo-SR59 were localized in the nucleus and chloroplasts. The Dlo-SR genes exhibited differential expression patterns in different tissues of longan. The transcript levels of Dlo-RSZ20a, Dlo-SC18, Dlo-RS2Z29, DLo-SR59, Dlo-SR53, and Dlo-SR17 were low in all analyzed tissues, whereas Dlo-RS43, Dlo-RS2Z16, Dlo-RS2Z24, and Dlo-SR30 were highly expressed in all tissues. To clarify their function during SE, the transcript levels of Dlo-SR genes were analyzed at different four stages of SE, comprising non-embryonic callus (NEC), friable-embryogenic callus (EC), incomplete compact pro-embryogenic culture (ICpEC) and globular embryo (GE). Interestingly, the transcript levels of Dlo-RS2Z29 and Dlo-SR112 were increased in embryogenic cells compared with the NEC stage, whereas transcript levels of Dlo-RSZ20a, Dlo-RS43, Dlo-SC37, and Dlo-RS2Z16 were especially increased at the GE stage compared with the other stages. Alternative splicing events of Dlo-SR mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) was detected during SE, with totals of 41, 29, 35, and 44 events detected during NEC, EC, ICpEC, and GE respectively. Protein–protein interaction analysis showed that SR proteins were capable of interaction with each other. The results indicate that the alternative splicing of Dlo-SR pre-mRNAs occurs during SE and that Dlo-SR proteins may interact to regulate embryogenesis of longan."

Vaccination against Newcastle Disease is one of the main control measures in countries such as Germany with endemic occurrence of Newcastle Disease virus in the free ranging bird population. The German Standing Veterinary Committee on Immunization (StIKo Vet) recommends to revaccinate chickens at intervals of six weeks against Newcastle Disease with attenuated live vaccines via drinking water or spray in line with the SPCs (Summary of Product Characteristics) of current vaccines. However, it is still common practice to revaccinate only every twelve weeks because the SPCs of former vaccines proposed a revaccination after checking the antibody titer which based on practical knowledge was typically sufficient for twelve weeks. The aim of this study was to evaluate if a vaccination interval of twelve weeks against Newcastle Disease under field conditions results in sufficient seroconversion to protect flocks. Antibody titers of 810 blood samples from 27 backyard flocks of chickens were analyzed by ELISA- and HI-tests between 69 and 111 days after vaccination of the flocks with attenuated live vaccines of the ND strain Clone 30. Furthermore, data on the flocks such as breed, sex and age were collected through a questionnaire. In this study a sufficient antibody titer was found in 26 of these flocks. Therefore, a vaccination interval of every twelve weeks with the live vaccines tested is suitable for a vaccination protocol against Newcastle Disease. The lack of seroconversion of one flock also emphasizes the need for regular vaccination monitoring by serological testing and re-evaluation of the vaccination process if needed."

Seventy-four adolescents with a mean 24-h heart rate ≥ 95 bpm (our cut-off for an IST based upon 66 healthy controls) were deemed to have IST. We found the risk of IST to be high in adolescents with attention deficit disorder (OR = 3.5,p<0.001), pre-hypertension (OR = 2.5, p = 0.043) and hypertension (OR = 2.1,p = 0.02); insignificantly enhanced in children with short stature (OR = 1.9,p = 0.19), surgically-treated congenital heart disease (OR = 1.4,p = 0.51) and obesity without hypertension (OR = 1.4;p = 0.25); and negligible in adolescents with anorexia nervosa (OR = 0.3, p = 0.26) and constitutional thinness (OR = 0.9,p = 0.89). IST was associated with a significant decrease in global HRV and elevated blood pressures, indicating an enhanced cardiovascular risk. Methylphenidate did not increase 24-h heart rates, whereas omega-3 fatty acid supplementation significantly decreased elevated heart rates and increased HRV in adolescents with IST. In this retrospective analysis, 15.4% of adolescents suffered from IST with a 24-h heart rate ≥ 95 bpm, predominately due to attention deficit disorder and hypertension."

They function by inhibiting the activity of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin toward nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT) in T-lymphocytes. However, use of CsA is associated with more serious side effects and worse clinical outcomes than FK506. Here we show that CsA, but not FK506, causes activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), an event which is normally an acute reaction to various types of intracellular insults, such as nutrient deficiency or endoplasmic reticulum stress. These effects of CsA involve at least two of the stress-activated protein kinases (GCN2 and PERK) that act on the translational machinery to slow down protein synthesis via phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2α and thereby induce the ISR. These actions of CsA likely contribute to the adverse effects associated with its clinical application."

In this cross-sectional study, the data of all patients were collected in 2009–2017 and analyzed by SPSS23 and Moran's and General G Index. The MaxEnt3.3.3 software was used to determine the ecological niche. A big hot spot area was identified in five counties in the northwest of Iran. More than 70% of the cases were reported from these regions, and the incidence rate increased in the northwest of Iran from 2013 to 2017. Seasonal rainfall and average daily temperature were the most important climate variables affecting the incidence of VL in this region (p < 0.05).

Here, we explored the role of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H), a key enzyme in the synthesis of the lipid mediator leukotriene B4 (LTB4), in diet-induced obesity. LTA4H-deficient (LTA4H-KO) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) showed a lean phenotype, and bone-marrow transplantation studies revealed that LTA4H-deficiency in non-hematopoietic cells was responsible for this lean phenotype. LTA4H-KO mice exhibited greater energy expenditure, but similar food intake and fecal energy loss. LTA4H-KO BAT showed higher expression of thermogenesis-related genes. In addition, the plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroid hormone concentrations, as well as HFD-induced catecholamine secretion, were higher in LTA4H-KO mice. In contrast, LTB4 receptor (BLT1)-deficient mice did not show a lean phenotype, implying that the phenotype of LTA4H-KO mice is independent of the LTB4/BLT1 axis. These results indicate that LTA4H mediates the diet-induced obesity by reducing catecholamine and thyroid hormone secretion."
https://openalex.org/W3080735427,"Background Inappropriate prescribing in the elderly is a critical issue in primary care, causing a higher risk of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) and resulting in major patient safety concerns. At international level, many tools have been developed to identify Potentially Inappropriate Medications (PIMs). Objective The aim of this study was the application of Beers, Screening Tool of Older People's Prescriptions (STOPP)/Screening Tool to Alert to Right Treatment (START) and Improving Prescribing in the Elderly Tool (IPET) criteria as key tool to improve the quality of prescribing. Methods A retrospective study was conducted using the aforementioned criteria. Two different cohorts of elderly patients were enrolled between January 2015 and December 2016, 1800 at admission and 1466 at hospital stay. The index of each criterion divided by politherapy were correlated with comorbidities (Pearson correlation). A comparison was made between admission and hospital stay through a Student's t test of the average of the index. Results The Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) were the most prescribed PIMs according Beers criteria in both patient cohorts (56%). The most detected drug-drug and drug-disease interactions at admission and at hospital stay were 3 or more drugs active on the Central Nervous System (CNS) as they can predispose to fall-risk. The most detected PIMs with STOPP criteria at admission were PPIs administered for more than 8 weeks. Inhaled β2-agonists or antimuscarinics were the most prescribed Potential Prescription Omissions (PPOs) according to START criteria. Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with high blood pressure were the most detected PIMs according to IPET criteria during hospital stay. A significant correlation between the comorbidities and the all index at hospital stay, while at admission there was no significant correlation for Beers and IPET index. Conclusion The prescriptive criteria were a useful tool for assessing the quality of prescriptions in the geriatric population and identifying their critical issues."
https://openalex.org/W3080543325,"Abstract Tamoxifen is the most prescribed selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator in patients with ER-positive breast cancers. Tamoxifen requires the transcription factor paired box 2 protein (PAX2) to repress the transcription of ERBB2/HER2. Now, we identified that PAX2 inhibits cell growth of ER+/HER2− tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, we have identified that cell growth inhibition can be achieved by expressing moderate levels of PAX2 in combination with tamoxifen treatment. Global run-on sequencing of cells overexpressing PAX2, when coupled with PAX2 ChIP-seq, identified common targets regulated by both PAX2 and tamoxifen. The data revealed that PAX2 can inhibit estrogen-induced gene transcription and this effect is enhanced by tamoxifen, suggesting that they converge on repression of the same targets. Moreover, PAX2 and tamoxifen have an additive effect and both induce coding genes and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). PAX2–tamoxifen upregulated genes are also enriched with PAX2 eRNAs. The enrichment of eRNAs is associated with the highest expression of genes that positivity regulate apoptotic processes. In luminal tumors, the expression of a subset of these proapoptotic genes predicts good outcome and their expression are significantly reduced in tumors of patients with relapse to tamoxifen treatment. Mechanistically, PAX2 and tamoxifen coexert an antitumoral effect by maintaining high levels of transcription of tumor suppressors that promote cell death. The apoptotic effect is mediated in large part by the gene interferon regulatory factor 1. Altogether, we conclude that PAX2 contributes to better clinical outcome in tamoxifen treated ER-positive breast cancer patients by repressing estrogen signaling and inducing cell death related pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3080799952,"Lipoic acid (LA) is a sulfur-containing cofactor that covalently binds to a variety of cognate enzymes that are essential for redox reactions in all three domains of life. Inherited mutations in the enzymes that make LA, namely lipoyl synthase, octanoyltransferase, and amidotransferase, result in devastating human metabolic disorders. Unfortunately, because many aspects of this essential pathway are still obscure, available treatments only serve to alleviate symptoms. We envisioned that the development of an organismal model system might provide new opportunities to interrogate LA biochemistry, biology, and physiology. Here we report our investigations on three Caenorhabditis elegans orthologous proteins involved in this post-translational modification. We established that M01F1.3 is a lipoyl synthase, ZC410.7 an octanoyltransferase, and C45G3.3 an amidotransferase. Worms subjected to RNAi against M01F1.3 and ZC410.7 manifest larval arrest in the second generation. The arrest was not rescued by LA supplementation, indicating that endogenous synthesis of LA is essential for C. elegans development. Expression of the enzymes M01F1.3, ZC410.7, and C45G3.3 completely rescue bacterial or yeast mutants affected in different steps of the lipoylation pathway, indicating functional overlap. Thus, we demonstrate that, similarly to humans, C. elegans is able to synthesize LA de novo via a lipoyl-relay pathway, and suggest that this nematode could be a valuable model to dissect the role of protein mislipoylation and to develop new therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3080807673,"Highly spread through the Amazon River basin, Prochilodus nigricans have had its taxonomic validity recently questioned, when genetic differences between Western and Eastern Amazon populations from the Brazilian shield were detected. This area has been seeing as a region of high ichthyofaunal diversity and endemism, in which the hybrid origin of the Tapajós River basin has been raised. In this paper, we report a new molecular lineage within P. nigricans of Tapajós River, highlighting this region still hides taxonomically significant diversity. Haplotype networks were reconstructed using the mitochondrial COI and ATP6/8 markers, which were also used to calculate genetic distances among clusters. We additionally conducted a delimiting species approach by employing a Generalized Mixed Yule-Coalescent model (GMYC) with COI sequences produced here, and previous ones published for individuals sampled across the Amazon River basin. In addition to the genetic differentiation within P. nigricans, our findings favor the hypothesis of hybrid origin of the Tapajós River basin and reaffirm the importance of studies aiming to investigate hidden diversity to address taxonomic and biogeographic issues, that certainly benefit better biodiversity conservation actions."
https://openalex.org/W3081121217,"Backgrounds and aims Because of the known limitations of ultrasonography (US) alone, we re-evaluated whether complimentary testing for serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is helpful in surveilling for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk populations. Methods We included, from a hospital-based cancer registry, 1,776 asymptomatic adults who were surveilled biannually with the AFP test and US and eventually diagnosed with HCC between 2007 and 2015. Based on the screening results, these patients were divided into three groups: AFP (positive for AFP only; n = 298 [16.8%]), US (positive for US only; n = 978 [55.0%]), and AFP+US (positive for both; n = 500 [28.2%]). We compared the outcomes of the three groups, calculating the survival of the AFP group both as observed survival and as survival corrected for lead-time. Results In terms of tumor-related factors, the separate AFP and US groups were more likely to have early stage HCC and to receive curative treatments than the combined AFP+US group (Ps<0.05). The AFP group had significantly better overall and cancer-specific survival than the AFP+US group after adjusting for covariates (adjusted hazard ratios [HRs] 0.68 and 0.62, respectively). In analyses correcting for lead-time in the AFP group (doubling time 120 days), the respective adjusted HRs for the AFP group were unchanged (0.74 and 0.67), but they were no longer significant after additional adjustment for tumor stage and curative treatment (0.87 and 0.81). Conclusions HCC cases detected by the AFP test without abnormal ultrasonic findings appear to have better survival, possibly as a result of stage migration and the resulting cures. Complementary AFP surveillance, together with US, could be helpful for at-risk patients."

https://openalex.org/W3081051643,"We have previously developed a new theory for pressure dependent outflow from the human eye, and tested the model using experimental data at intraocular pressures above normal eye pressures. In this paper, we use our model to analyze a hypotensive pressure-time dataset obtained following application of a Honan balloon. Here we show that the hypotensive pressure-time data can be successfully analyzed using our proposed pressure dependent outflow model. When the most uncertain initial data point is removed from the dataset, then parameter estimates are close to our previous parameter estimates, but clearly parameter estimates are very sensitive to assumptions. We further show that (i) for a measured intraocular pressure-time curve, the estimated model parameter for whole eye surface hydraulic conductivity is primarily a function of the ocular rigidity, and (ii) the estimated model parameter that controls the rate of decrease of outflow with increasing pressure is primarily a function of the convexity of the monotonic pressure-time curve. Reducing parameter uncertainty could be accomplished using new technologies to obtain higher quality datasets, and by gathering additional data to better define model parameter ranges for the normal eye. With additional research, we expect the pressure dependent outflow analysis described herein may find applications in the differential diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of the glaucomatous eye."
