https://openalex.org/W2765567136,"Chromosome conformation capture technologies have revealed important insights into genome folding. Yet, how spatial genome architecture is related to gene expression and cell fate remains unclear. We comprehensively mapped 3D chromatin organization during mouse neural differentiation in vitro and in vivo, generating the highest-resolution Hi-C maps available to date. We found that transcription is correlated with chromatin insulation and long-range interactions, but dCas9-mediated activation is insufficient for creating TAD boundaries de novo. Additionally, we discovered long-range contacts between gene bodies of exon-rich, active genes in all cell types. During neural differentiation, contacts between active TADs become less pronounced while inactive TADs interact more strongly. An extensive Polycomb network in stem cells is disrupted, while dynamic interactions between neural transcription factors appear in vivo. Finally, cell type-specific enhancer-promoter contacts are established concomitant to gene expression. This work shows that multiple factors influence the dynamics of chromatin interactions in development."
https://openalex.org/W2765195199,"Summary Laboratory mice, while paramount for understanding basic biological phenomena, are limited in modeling complex diseases of humans and other free-living mammals. Because the microbiome is a major factor in mammalian physiology, we aimed to identify a naturally evolved reference microbiome to better recapitulate physiological phenomena relevant in the natural world outside the laboratory. Among 21 distinct mouse populations worldwide, we identified a closely related wild relative to standard laboratory mouse strains. Its bacterial gut microbiome differed significantly from its laboratory mouse counterpart and was transferred to and maintained in laboratory mice over several generations. Laboratory mice reconstituted with natural microbiota exhibited reduced inflammation and increased survival following influenza virus infection and improved resistance against mutagen/inflammation-induced colorectal tumorigenesis. By demonstrating the host fitness-promoting traits of natural microbiota, our findings should enable the discovery of protective mechanisms relevant in the natural world and improve the modeling of complex diseases of free-living mammals.

https://openalex.org/W2759112714,"Ferroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is pathogenic to several acute and chronic diseases and executed via oxygenation of polyunsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) by 15-lipoxygenases (15-LO) that normally use free polyunsaturated fatty acids as substrates. Mechanisms of the altered 15-LO substrate specificity are enigmatic. We sought a common ferroptosis regulator for 15LO. We discovered that PEBP1, a scaffold protein inhibitor of protein kinase cascades, complexes with two 15LO isoforms, 15LO1 and 15LO2, and changes their substrate competence to generate hydroperoxy-PE. Inadequate reduction of hydroperoxy-PE due to insufficiency or dysfunction of a selenoperoxidase, GPX4, leads to ferroptosis. We demonstrated the importance of PEBP1-dependent regulatory mechanisms of ferroptotic death in airway epithelial cells in asthma, kidney epithelial cells in renal failure, and cortical and hippocampal neurons in brain trauma. As master regulators of ferroptotic cell death with profound implications for human disease, PEBP1/15LO complexes represent a new target for drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2765934351,"The mTORC1 kinase is a master growth regulator that senses many environmental cues, including amino acids. Activation of mTORC1 by arginine requires SLC38A9, a poorly understood lysosomal membrane protein with homology to amino acid transporters. Here, we validate that SLC38A9 is an arginine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway, and we uncover an unexpectedly central role for SLC38A9 in amino acid homeostasis. SLC38A9 mediates the transport, in an arginine-regulated fashion, of many essential amino acids out of lysosomes, including leucine, which mTORC1 senses through the cytosolic Sestrin proteins. SLC38A9 is necessary for leucine generated via lysosomal proteolysis to exit lysosomes and activate mTORC1. Pancreatic cancer cells, which use macropinocytosed protein as a nutrient source, require SLC38A9 to form tumors. Thus, through SLC38A9, arginine serves as a lysosomal messenger that couples mTORC1 activation to the release from lysosomes of the essential amino acids needed to drive cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2766380081,"Infection is restrained by the concerted activation of tissue-resident and circulating immune cells. Whether tissue-resident lymphocytes confer early antiviral immunity at local sites of primary infection prior to the initiation of circulating responses is not well understood. Furthermore, the kinetics of initial antiviral responses at sites of infection remain unclear. Here, we show that tissue-resident type 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1) serve an essential early role in host immunity through rapid production of interferon (IFN)-γ following viral infection. Ablation of Zfp683-dependent liver ILC1 lead to increased viral load in the presence of intact adaptive and innate immune cells critical for mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) clearance. Swift production of interleukin (IL)-12 by tissue-resident XCR1+ conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) promoted ILC1 production of IFN-γ in a STAT4-dependent manner to limit early viral burden. Thus, ILC1 contribute an essential role in viral immunosurveillance at sites of initial infection in response to local cDC1-derived proinflammatory cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2765298868,"Constitutive cell-autonomous immunity in metazoans predates interferon-inducible immunity and comprises primordial innate defense. Phagocytes mobilize interferon-inducible responses upon engagement of well-characterized signaling pathways by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The signals controlling deployment of constitutive cell-autonomous responses during infection have remained elusive. Vita-PAMPs denote microbial viability, signaling the danger of cellular exploitation by intracellular pathogens. We show that cyclic-di-adenosine monophosphate in live Gram-positive bacteria is a vita-PAMP, engaging the innate sensor stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to mediate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Subsequent inactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin mobilizes autophagy, which sequesters stressed ER membranes, resolves ER stress, and curtails phagocyte death. This vita-PAMP-induced ER-phagy additionally orchestrates an interferon response by localizing ER-resident STING to autophagosomes. Our findings identify stress-mediated ER-phagy as a cell-autonomous response mobilized by STING-dependent sensing of a specific vita-PAMP and elucidate how innate receptors engage multilayered homeostatic mechanisms to promote immunity and survival after infection."
https://openalex.org/W2765658539,"Precise genome editing via homology-directed repair (HDR) in targeted cells, particularly in vivo, provides an invaluable tool for biomedical research. However, HDR has been considered to be largely restricted to dividing cells, making it challenging to apply the technique in postmitotic neurons. Here we show that precise genome editing via HDR is possible in mature postmitotic neurons as well as mitotic cells in mice brain by combining CRISPR-Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage and the efficient delivery of donor template with adeno-associated virus (AAV). Using this strategy, we achieved efficient tagging of endogenous proteins in primary and organotypic cultures in vitro and developing, adult, aged, and pathological brains in vivo. Thus, AAV- and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated HDR will be broadly useful for precise genome editing in basic and translational neuroscience."
https://openalex.org/W2766617104,"In mammals, the environment plays a critical role in promoting the final steps in neuronal development during the early postnatal period. While epigenetic factors are thought to contribute to this process, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that in the brain during early life, the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A transiently binds across transcribed regions of lowly expressed genes, and its binding specifies the pattern of DNA methylation at CA sequences (mCA) within these genes. We find that DNMT3A occupancy and mCA deposition within the transcribed regions of genes is negatively regulated by gene transcription and may be modified by early-life experience. Once deposited, mCA is bound by the methyl-DNA-binding protein MECP2 and functions in a rheostat-like manner to fine-tune the cell-type-specific transcription of genes that are critical for brain function."
https://openalex.org/W2765507458,"Insulin resistance is a hallmark of diabetes and an unmet clinical need. Insulin inhibits hepatic glucose production and promotes lipogenesis by suppressing FOXO1-dependent activation of G6pase and inhibition of glucokinase, respectively. The tight coupling of these events poses a dual conundrum: mechanistically, as the FOXO1 corepressor of glucokinase is unknown, and clinically, as inhibition of glucose production is predicted to increase lipogenesis. Here, we report that SIN3A is the insulin-sensitive FOXO1 corepressor of glucokinase. Genetic ablation of SIN3A abolishes nutrient regulation of glucokinase without affecting other FOXO1 target genes and lowers glycemia without concurrent steatosis. To extend this work, we executed a small-molecule screen and discovered selective inhibitors of FOXO-dependent glucose production devoid of lipogenic activity in hepatocytes. In addition to identifying a novel mode of insulin action, these data raise the possibility of developing selective modulators of unliganded transcription factors to dial out adverse effects of insulin sensitizers."
https://openalex.org/W2765459808,"Glucagon-like Peptide 1 (GLP-1)-expressing neurons in the hindbrain send robust projections to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), which is involved in the regulation of food intake. Here, we describe that stimulation of GLP-1 afferent fibers within the PVN is sufficient to suppress food intake independent of glutamate release. We also show that GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activation augments excitatory synaptic strength in PVN corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons, with GLP-1R activation promoting a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent signaling cascade leading to phosphorylation of serine S845 on GluA1 AMPA receptors and their trafficking to the plasma membrane. Finally, we show that postnatal depletion of GLP-1R in the PVN increases food intake and causes obesity. This study provides a comprehensive multi-level (circuit, synaptic, and molecular) explanation of how food intake behavior and body weight are regulated by endogenous central GLP-1. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

In in vivo efficacy assays, lentiviral circuit delivery mediated significant tumor reduction and prolonged mouse survival. Our design could be adapted to drive additional immunomodulators, sense other cancers, and potentially treat other diseases that require precise immunological programming. The potential of cancer immunotherapy has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, yet this approach is still limited by several major challenges, including the lack of targetable tumor-specific antigens and tumor-mediated immunosuppression. For example, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells and bispecific antibodies should ideally target cell-surface antigens that are exclusively present on tumor cells, since targeting normal tissues can result in severe side effects (Morgan et al., 2010Morgan R.A. Yang J.C. Kitano M. Dudley M.E. Laurencot C.M. Rosenberg S.A. Case report of a serious adverse event following the administration of T cells transduced with a chimeric antigen receptor recognizing ERBB2.Mol. Ther. 2010; 18: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar). However, finding highly tumor-specific surface antigens is difficult, which limits the range of targetable tumors (Klebanoff et al., 2016Klebanoff C.A. Rosenberg S.A. Restifo N.P. Prospects for gene-engineered T cell immunotherapy for solid cancers.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In addition, even when ideal targetable tumor antigens are available, tumor-mediated immunosuppression can prevent successful immunotherapy by disrupting important immunological functions that are necessary for effective anti-tumor immune responses (Rabinovich et al., 2007Rabinovich G.A. Gabrilovich D. Sotomayor E.M. Immunosuppressive strategies that are mediated by tumor cells.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 267-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Immunostimulatory factors can be utilized to overcome these challenges, but off-target activity often results in severe toxicity. For example, surface T cell engagers (STEs) are artificial immunogenic cell-surface proteins that bind the non-variable regions of the T cell receptor complex (Liao et al., 2000Liao K.W. Lo Y.C. Roffler S.R. Activation of lymphocytes by anti-CD3 single-chain antibody dimers expressed on the plasma membrane of tumor cells.Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Liao et al., 2003Liao K.W.

Stable expression of chimeric anti-CD3 receptors on mammalian cells for stimulation of antitumor immunity.Cancer Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consequently, STE-expressing cells are designated for T cell-mediated killing regardless of T cell receptor antigen specificity (see Figure 1B for our STE design based on membrane-anchored anti-CD3 single-chain variable fragment [scFv]). Tumor-specific STE expression can substitute for targetable tumor antigens but must be constrained to cancer cells to avoid damage to healthy tissues (Liao et al., 2003Liao K.W. Chen B.M. Liu T.B. Tzou S.C. Lin Y.M. Lin K.F. Su C.I. Roffler S.R. Stable expression of chimeric anti-CD3 receptors on mammalian cells for stimulation of antitumor immunity.Cancer Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Other immunomodulators, such as chemokines, cytokines, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, can assist in overcoming tumor-mediated immunosuppression but have caused severe side effects in clinical trials (Lasek et al., 2014Lasek W.

Furthermore, individual immunomodulators are frequently insufficient on their own to yield strong anti-tumor efficacy (Mahoney et al., 2015Mahoney K.M. Rennert P.D. Freeman G.J. Combination cancer immunotherapy and new immunomodulatory targets.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2015; 14: 561-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Combinatorial immunotherapy can provide significantly stronger efficacy but also increase the risk and severity of adverse effects (Boutros et al., 2016Boutros C. Tarhini A. Routier E. Lambotte O.

Oncol. 2016; 13: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Tumor-localized release of immunomodulators could potentially decrease these systemic side effects and improve the therapeutic efficacy, but is challenging. Thus, although various strategies are being explored to overcome this problem (Neri and Sondel, 2016Neri D. Sondel P.M. Immunocytokines for cancer treatment: past, present and future.Curr. Opin.

For example, synthetic tumor-targeting gene circuits have previously been designed to target tumor cells with enhanced specificity but have not leveraged the anti-tumor potential of the immune system, which may limit their efficacy (Liu et al., 2014Liu Y.

Multi-input RNAi-based logic circuit for identification of specific cancer cells.Science. 2011; 333: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that gene circuits could be designed to achieve tumor-specific production of multiple immunomodulators and thus overcome major obstacles in current immunotherapies (Figure 1A). Here, we demonstrate the potential of gene circuits for cancer immunotherapy. Tumor-targeting gene circuits often require promoters with high cell-state specificity to function as cancer sensors, which can be hard to find (Selvakumaran et al., 2001Selvakumaran M. Bao R. Crijns A.P. Connolly D.C. Weinstein J.K. Hamilton T.C.

Med. 2008; 40: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, native mammalian promoters can span several kb and are therefore difficult to fit into the limited encoding capacity of many viral vectors. Thus, we constructed compact synthetic promoters de novo that exhibited enhanced specificity for human cancer cells compared with previously described endogenous cancer-specific promoters. Discriminating cancer cells based on the integration of multiple cancer markers significantly enhances targeting specificity (Liu et al., 2014Liu Y. Zeng Y. Liu L. Zhuang C. Fu X. Huang W. Cai Z.

Multi-input RNAi-based logic circuit for identification of specific cancer cells.Science. 2011; 333: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Thus, to enhance the circuit selectivity over a single synthetic promoter, we designed a synthetic RNA-based circuit that integrates the activity of two synthetic ovarian-cancer-specific promoters and generates output proteins only when both promoters are decidedly active, analogous to a Boolean AND gate. Specifically, input promoter 1 (P1) regulates an auto-inhibitory mRNA that encodes the output protein, while input promoter 2 (P2) regulates an RNA molecule that relieves the auto-inhibition and thus enables output production. This RNA-based design has the potential to reduce the off-target immunogenic signature of the circuit by minimizing the expression of foreign proteins in normal cells. Immunomodulatory outputs used in this study include a cell-surface antigen (STE), a chemokine that promotes T cell trafficking to tumor sites (CCL21), a cytokine that enhances T cell activation and function (IL12), and an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD1 antibody), hereafter referred to as the SCIP combination (Lasek et al., 2014Lasek W.

Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Cancer Therapy.J. Clin. Oncol. 2015; 33: 1974-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). We characterized our circuits with in vitro specificity assays using normal and cancer cell lines and in vivo efficacy assays using a disseminated ovarian cancer model, which recapitulates advanced human ovarian cancer (Lengyel et al., 2014Lengyel E. Burdette J.E. Kenny H.A. Matei D. Pilrose J. Haluska P. Nephew K.P. Hales D.B. Stack M.S. Epithelial ovarian cancer experimental models.Oncogene. 2014; 33: 3619-3633Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated that our circuit can be readily modified to target breast cancer cells by replacing the synthetic input promoters. Our circuit design is modular and enables facile construction, testing, and optimization of arbitrary promoter inputs, circuit components, and outputs. The outputs can be any genetically encodable element, including intracellular, secreted, and cell-surface proteins. This flexibility will enable circuits to be optimized using advanced tumor models and patient-derived tumors, which will be important for translation into clinical use. Thus, our programmable immunomodulatory gene circuits have broad potential utility for cancer immunotherapy and studying tumor immunology. We first designed and optimized the RNA-based AND gate. We engineered two genetic modules such that each was regulated by a separate promoter (Figures 2A and 2B). Module 1 consists of P1, which regulates the expression of an RNA that encodes two exons of an output protein mKate2 (mK-Ex1, mK-Ex2), separated by a synthetic intronic microRNA (miRNA) (miR1), as well as perfect match miR1 binding sites (BS[Pe]) downstream to the second exon. Following splicing, the exons are assembled into a mature output mRNA that contains BS(Pe)s in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR), while the intron is processed by the cell to produce miR1. Consequently, when only P1 is active, miR1 binds the BS(Pe) sites in the output mRNA and targets it for degradation. Therefore, module 1 constitutes an auto-inhibitory loop for output protein production (Figure 2A). Module 2 consists of P2, which regulates a miRNA sponge that consists of multiple bulged complementary miR1 binding sites (BS[B]) and thus acts as a miR1 shunt that relieves the auto-inhibitory nature of module 1 when it is expressed (Figures 2A and 2B). In this system, the output protein is expressed at a high level only when the promoters regulating both modules are mutually active. However, when only one of the promoters is active or when none of the promoters are active, output protein expression is low. We systematically optimized various aspects of the miRNA-based mechanism (Figures 3, S1, S2, S3, and STAR Methods) (Auyeung et al., 2013Auyeung V.C. Ulitsky I. McGeary S.E. Bartel D.P.

In module 2, we characterized how the miRNA binding site (BS) sequence, expression level, and sponge architecture determines the efficiency of the miR1 sponge (Figures 3, S1, and S2). We defined four different states for this circuit: in state [0,0], both module 1 and module 2 are inactive; in state [0,1], module 1 is inactive, while module 2 is active; in state [1,0], module 1 is active, while module 2 is inactive; and in state [1,1], both module 1 and module 2 are active (Figure 2B). The ON-OFF ratio for the AND gate circuit was defined as the mKate2 output level in the presence versus the absence of the sponge (state [1,1] versus state [1,0] in Figure 2B). Ultimately, we chose Sponge 7: H2A1p-EC1-10BZRANB1-EC2-5B (Figure S2A) as the final “optimized sponge” design because it yielded the highest ON-OFF ratio for the AND gate circuit (∼6-fold, Figure S2A).Figure S1Optimization of the miRNA Binding-Site Sequences in the Sponge in Module 2, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) The activity of the promoters SSX1p, H2A1p, and CMVp in HEK293T cells.(B–C) Various miRNA binding sequences (miR1-BSs) used in the sponge affect sponging activity, assayed by mKate2 fold activation by each sponge (state [1,1] versus state [1,0] in Figure 2B).

In module 1, we optimized the synthetic intronic pri-miRNA backbone in the self-inhibitory mKate2 transcript for enhanced miR1 production efficiency (Greber et al., 2008Greber D.

The absolute mKate2 signal in the OFF (no sponge, state [1,0]) and ON states (optimized sponge, state [1,1]) were both affected by the pri-miRNA designs we tested (Mv1-Mv3, Figure S3). Mv1 exhibited an OFF-ON shift from ∼1400 to ∼8400 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) (5.8-fold activation ratio), Mv2 from ∼170 to ∼500 MFI (3-fold activation), and Mv3 from ∼380 to ∼2600 MFI (6.8-fold activation) (Figures S3D and S3E). We selected the Mv3 architecture for further experimentation because it had low mKate2 level in the OFF state, substantial absolute mKate2 levels in the ON state, and the highest fold activation. However, we note that different designs could be more suitable for other targeting scenarios. For example, when using effector outputs with low potency, Mv1 could be chosen to achieve high absolute levels of expression in the ON state. Conversely, Mv2 could be suitable for expressing extremely potent outputs for which even low background output activity could be detrimental. To generate synthetic ovarian-cancer-specific promoters, we identified transcription factors (TFs) that are overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells by comparing gene expression in primary human ovarian tumors versus healthy controls, and the respective binding motifs of these TFs, using publically available databases (STAR Methods). In each synthetic promoter S(TF)p, multiple binding motifs for a single cancer-specific TF were encoded in tandem upstream to a synthetic minimal promoter derived from the major adenoviral late promoter (Figure 4A). This design approach resulted in compact promoters with evenly distributed and dense TF-BSs corresponding to a small number of TF families. For example, analysis of the 1-kb upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) of the native tumor-specific promoter H2A1p (Rogakou et al., 1998Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. DNA double-stranded breaks induce histone H2AX phosphorylation on serine 139.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (4142) Google Scholar) revealed ∼82 possible BSs for 40 different TF families, with a mean of ∼8 TF-BSs per 100 bp. In comparison, the synthetic S(E2F1)p promoter, comprised of E2F1 BSs, had only 44 possible BSs for 7 different TF families, with a mean of ∼16 TF-BSs per 100 bp (Table S1 and STAR Methods). We assayed the specificity and activity of natural and artificial promoters in human OVCAR8 (OV8) ovarian cancer cells and normal primary cells, including primary adult human dermal fibroblasts (aHDF) and primary human ovarian epithelium (HOV). Several synthetic promoters, including S(E2F1)p and S(cMYC)p (comprised of E2F1 and cMYC BSs, respectively), were highly active in OV8 ovarian cancer cells, but not in normal cells. These synthetic promoters exhibited greater activation ratios compared with known native tumor-specific promoters such as SSX1p (Gure et al., 1997Gure A.O. Türeci O. Sahin U. Tsang S. Scanlan M.J. Jäger E. Knuth A. Pfreundschuh M. Old L.J. Chen Y.T. SSX: a multigene family with several members transcribed in normal testis and human cancer.Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and H2A1p (Rogakou et al., 1998Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. DNA double-stranded breaks induce histone H2AX phosphorylation on serine 139.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (4142) Google Scholar) (Figure 4B for selected promoters). For example, SSX1p exhibited 9-fold activation in OV8 compared to aHDF and 17-fold activation compared to HOV (Figure 4B). H2A1p had 2-fold activation in OV8 compared to aHDF and 5.6-fold compared to HOV. The synthetic promoter S(E2F1)p had 224-fold induction in OV8 versus aHDF and 570-fold activation in OV8 compared to HOV, with absolute maximal expression levels comparable to the native promoters. S(cMYC)p exhibited 15-fold induction in OV8 versus aHDF and 36-fold activation in OV8 compared to HOV. Since the maximal activity of S(cMYC)p was lower than that of S(E2F1)p in OV8 cells, we selected S(cMYC)p to drive expression of module 1 and S(E2F1)p to drive the expression of module 2. This was done so that the sponge could be expressed at a greater level than the miR1-encoding construct, w"

Its homozygous loss is tolerated in seemingly healthy individuals, with reduced circulating B12 levels being the only and consistent phenotype reported to date. Here, by combining enzymology, structural biology, and activity-based metabolomics, we report that CLYBL operates as a citramalyl-CoA lyase in mammalian cells. Cells lacking CLYBL accumulate citramalyl-CoA, an intermediate in the C5-dicarboxylate metabolic pathway that includes itaconate, a recently identified human anti-microbial metabolite and immunomodulator. We report that CLYBL loss leads to a cell-autonomous defect in the mitochondrial B12 metabolism and that itaconyl-CoA is a cofactor-inactivating, substrate-analog inhibitor of the mitochondrial B12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT). Our work de-orphans the function of human CLYBL and reveals that a consequence of exposure to the immunomodulatory metabolite itaconate is B12 inactivation."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized neuropathologically by the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the presence of Lewy bodies (LBs) containing α-synuclein (Spillantini et al., 1997Spillantini M.G.

These unexpected findings in the kidney are consistent with the report that LRRK2 is normally most abundantly expressed in the kidney (Biskup et al., 2007Biskup S. Moore D.J. Rea A.

Thus, it is critically important to elucidate the normal physiological role of LRRK2 in the brain to shed light on the pathogenic mechanism. We therefore generated LRRK-deficient mice, in which LRRK2 and its functional homolog LRRK1 are inactivated, as LRRK1, which is relatively abundant in the brain (Biskup et al., 2007Biskup S. Moore D.J. Rea A. Lorenz-Deperieux B. Coombes C.E. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. West A.B.

Unexpectedly, LRRK1/2 double-knockout (LRRK DKO) mice exhibit earlier mortality at ∼16 months of age with marked reduction of body weight but largely normal brain weight. Interestingly, LRRK DKO mice, but not LRRK1 or LRRK2 single-KO mice, develop age-dependent DA neurodegeneration, as shown by age-dependent reduction of DA neurons in the SNpc at 14–15 months but not at younger ages. The cerebral cortex and cerebellum, however, are unaffected, though noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus and medium spiny neurons of the striatum are also reduced in LRRK DKO mice at 15 months. The selective, age-dependent neurodegeneration is accompanied by increases in apoptotic cell death, increased levels of α-synuclein, and impaired autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Quantitative electron microscopy (EM) analysis further revealed dramatic increases of autophagic vacuoles in the SNpc of LRRK DKO mice at 10 months, before the onset of DA neuron loss and increases of apoptosis. These results demonstrate that LRRK is required for age-dependent survival of DA neurons and plays an essential role in the regulation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in the aging brain. To generate LRRK-null mice lacking both LRRK1 and LRRK2, we obtained a targeted LRRK1 embryonic stem cell (ESC) clone (EPD0073_6_C01) from the KOMP repository (https://www.komp.org/). The targeted LRRK1 allele contains the gene-trapping En2SA-IRES-lacZ and hbactP-neo selection cassettes in LRRK1 intron 3 and a third loxP site in intron 5 (Figure 1A). The entire En2SA-IRES-lacZ and hbactP-neo sequence is flanked by two FRT sites, and the hbactP-neo cassette is flanked by two loxP sites. The introduction of the gene-trap En2SA-IRES-lacZ cassette was intended to cause gene inactivation by premature transcriptional termination, as splicing is expected to occur from the splice donor site of LRRK1 exon 3 to the splice acceptor site of exon 2 of the engrailed 2 gene (En2SA), leading to the predicted production of a chimeric transcript (LRRK1-lacZ) composed of LRRK1 exons 1–3, En2 exon 2, IRES, and lacZ sequences (Figure S1A). We confirmed the ESC clone carrying the targeted allele by Southern blotting using the 5′ and 3′ external probes (Figure S1B) as well as the neo probe (data not shown). The chimeric mice resulting from the confirmed ESCs were bred to B6/129 F1 mice to generate targeted LRRK1 mice, which were termed Line 1 (or “Knockout First” by KOMP). The germline transmission of the targeted LRRK1 allele was confirmed by Southern blotting using the 5′ and 3′ external probes (data not shown). Northern analysis of RNA derived from the brain and kidney of mutant mice homozygous for the LRRK1 targeted allele (Line 1) revealed that there are small amounts of full-length LRRK1 mRNA using a cDNA probe specific for exons 25–31 (Figure 1B). qRT-PCR using primers specific for exons 30 and 31 confirmed that there are ∼19% and ∼13% of LRRK1 mRNA remaining in the brain and the kidney of these mutant mice, respectively (Figure S1C). Using a cDNA probe specific for LRRK1 exons 2–3, we also detected the anticipated LRRK1-lacZ transcript in the brain and kidney of Line 1 targeted LRRK1 mutant mice (Figure 1B). RT-PCR using primers in exons 3 and 6 followed by sequencing identified not only normal LRRK1 transcripts (591 bp) retaining all exons examined (exons 3–6) but also an additional aberrant chimeric transcript (706 bp) containing LRRK1 exon 3, part of En2 exon 2, and LRRK1 exons 4–6 (Figure S1D), due to the presence of a putative splice donor site within En2 exon 2 (Figure S1A). Therefore, the targeted allele (Line 1) is not a null allele as it allows expression of full-length LRRK1 mRNA as well as aberrant splice products (Figures 1B and S1D). We then crossed Line 1 with Cre deleter mice and removed the floxed LRRK1 exons 4–5 to generate LRRK1 deletion mice (Line 2; Figure 1A). Using the external 5′ and 3′ probes, Southern analysis confirmed the deletion of LRRK1 exons 4–5 in Line 2 mutant mice (Figures S1F and 1A). Northern analysis using cDNA probes specific for exons 25–31 or exons 2–3 revealed no detectable full-length LRRK1 mRNA in homozygous Line 2 deletion mice (Figure 1C). Extensive RT-PCR analysis followed by sequencing confirmed the absence of full-length LRRK1 mRNA in these homozygous Line 2 mice (Figure S1G). We therefore concluded that Line 2 represents a null allele and subsequently used this line for all phenotypic analysis. LRRK DKO (LRRK1−/−; LRRK2−/−) mice were obtained at the expected Mendelian ratio from intercrossing LRRK1+/−; LRRK2+/− mice (Table S1). Western analysis confirmed the absence of LRRK1 and LRRK2 proteins in the lung of LRRK DKO mice, as LRRK1 is most abundant in the lung (Figure 1D). LRRK DKO mice exhibit striking age-dependent reduction in body weight (Figure 1E), but the brain weight is largely unchanged (Figure 1F). The dramatic weight loss phenotype of LRRK DKO mice is absent in LRRK mutant mice carrying homozygous Line 1 and LRRK2-null alleles (Figure S1E), consistent with the presence of full-length LRRK1 mRNA in Line 1 mutants (Figures 1B, S1C, and S1D). LRRK1 KO mice (Line 2) at 15 months also showed reduced body weight but normal brain weight (Figures S1I and S1J), and they did not exhibit earlier mortality. LRRK DKO mice die at ∼16 months of age with cataracts (Figure S1H). To determine whether inactivation of LRRK affects DA neurons in the SNpc, we performed immunostaining in LRRK DKO mice using an antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The morphology of TH+ DA neurons in LRRK DKO mice at the ages of 2, 8, 12, 14, and 15 months appears normal (Figures 2A and S2F). Stereological neuron counting revealed that the number of TH+ neurons in the SNpc of LRRK DKO mice is significantly reduced (∼22%) at 15 months, relative to littermate wild-type controls (Figure 2B), whereas the number of TH+ neurons in the SNpc of LRRK1 and LRRK2 KO mice is unchanged (Figures S2A and S2B). The loss of DA neurons in the SNpc of LRRK DKO mice is age dependent, as the number of TH+ DA neurons in the SNpc of LRRK DKO mice is unchanged at the ages of 2 months (Figure 2B), 8 months (Figure S2G), 10 months (data not shown), and 12 months (Figure 2B), but significantly reduced (∼16%) at the age of 14 months (Figure 2B). We further performed TH and NeuN double immunostaining of LRRK DKO and wild-type mice at 15 months of age and found that the numbers of NeuN+ and NeuN+/TH+ neurons are also significantly reduced in the SNpc of LRRK DKO mice (Figures S2H–S2K). We also measured the levels of striatal DA and its major metabolites using HPLC. The striatal DA level is significantly reduced in LRRK DKO mice at 15 months, compared to their wild-type littermate controls (Figure 2E), whereas DA levels are unchanged in LRRK DKO mice at 2 and 8 months (Figure S2D). Levels of dihydroxylphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), one of the major metabolites of DA, are also reduced in the striatum of LRRK DKO mice at 15 months (Figure 2F) but not at 2 and 8 months (Figure S2E). These results are consistent with the significant reduction of TH+ DA neurons in the SNpc of LRRK DKO mice at 14–15 months. Because loss of noradrenergic neurons in the LC has also been reported in PD patients (Forno, 1996Forno L.S. Neuropathology of Parkinson’s disease.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar), we quantified the number of TH+ noradrenergic neurons in the LC. The number of noradrenergic neurons in the LC is significantly reduced in LRRK DKO mice at 15 months, relative to littermate wild-type controls (Figures 2C and 2D). Thus, LRRK function is required for survival of DA neurons in the SNpc and noradrenergic neurons in the LC. To determine further whether loss of DA neurons and noradrenergic neurons in LRRK DKO mice is due to increases in apoptosis, we used an antibody specific for active caspases-3 and the TUNEL assay to label apoptotic cells. We observed increases of active caspases-3+ cells in the SNpc and striatum but not in the neocortex in LRRK DKO mice at 15 months (Figures 3A and 3B ). The number of active caspases-3+ cells in the SNpc, striatum, and neocortex of LRRK1 KO and LRRK2 KO mice at 15 months is much lower than that in LRRK DKO mice and is similar to the control (Figures S3A and S3B). Consistent with these findings, the number of TUNEL+ cells is also higher in the SNpc and striatum but not in the neocortex of LRRK DKO mice at 15 months of age, relative to control mice (Figures 3C and 3D). At younger ages of 8 months (data not shown) and 12 months (Figures S3C and S3D), we did not observe increases in apoptosis in any of the brain sub-regions of LRRK DKO mice, relative to other genotypic groups. The age-dependent and selective increase of apoptotic cell death is consistent with the age-dependent loss of DA neurons in the SNpc of LRRK DKO mice. The increase in apoptosis in the striatum of LRRK DKO mice at 15 months prompted us to examine whether the number of medium spiny neurons, which represent >90% of neurons in the striatum and express the highest level of LRRK2 in the brain, is affected in the absence of LRRK. We used DARPP32 immunoreactivity to label medium spiny neurons and found that the number of medium spiny neurons and the volume of the striatum are indeed significantly reduced in LRRK2 DKO mice at this age (Figures 3E and 3F). To determine whether loss of LRRK function causes neurodegeneration in other brain sub-regions, we examined the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum. We used stereological methods to quantify the volume and neuron number in the cerebral cortex of LRRK DKO mice and wild-type littermate controls at 15 months of age and found that the volume of the cerebral cortex (Figures 4A and 4B ) and the number of cortical neurons labeled by NeuN immunoreactivity (Figures 4C and 4D) are unchanged in LRRK DKO mice at 15 months. Further quantitative analysis of the cerebellum also showed normal cerebellar volume and number of Purkinje cells labeled by calbindin immunoreactivity in LRRK DKO mice at 15 months (Figures 4E–4G). Consistent with selective increases of apoptosis in brain sub-regions, these results further support the notion that loss of LRRK causes neurodegeneration in a neuron-subtype-specific manner. We previously reported 60-fold increases of α-synuclein monomer in the LRRK2−/− kidney at 20 months (Tong et al., 2010Tong Y. Yamaguchi H. Giaime E. Boyle S. Kopan R. Kelleher 3rd, R.J. Shen J. Loss of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 causes impairment of protein degradation pathways, accumulation of alpha-synuclein, and apoptotic cell death in aged mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 9879-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), but levels of α-synuclein are unchanged in LRRK2−/− kidneys at 15 months (E.G. and J.S., unpublished data). We performed immunohistochemical and western analyses as well as ELISA to evaluate α-synuclein levels in the brain of LRRK DKO and control mice. Quantification of α-synuclein immunoreactivity indicated significant increases of α-synuclein in the SNpc and striatum but not in the neocortex of LRRK DKO mice at 15 months, relative to littermate wild-type controls (Figures 5A and 5B ), though α-synuclein immunoreactivity is unchanged in the SNpc and striatum of LRRK1 and LRRK2 single-KO mice (Figures S4A and S4B). Western analysis showed significant increases of α-synuclein monomer and higher-molecular-weight (HMW) species in the striatum of LRRK DKO mice (Figures 5C and 5D). ELISA also showed that α-synuclein levels are increased in the striatum but not in the neocortex of LRRK DKO mice at 15 months of age (Figure 5E). At 12 and 14 months of age, however, levels of α-synuclein immunoreactivity are not significantly changed in the SNpc, striatum, and neocortex of LRRK DKO mice (Figures S4C–S4F). These results indicate that loss of LRRK results in an age-dependent accumulation of α-synuclein in the SNpc and the striatum. We further examined whether ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is affected in the brain of LRRK DKO mice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significant increases of ubiquitin immunoreactivity in the striatum of LRRK DKO mice at 15 months (Figures S4G and S4H). Consistent with this finding, western analysis showed significant increases of HMW species immunoreactive for ubiquitin-specific antibodies in the striatum of LRRK DKO mice at 15 months (Figures S4I and S4J) but not at 12 months (data not shown), suggesting an age-dependent accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the absence of LRRK. To determine whether the autophagy-lysosomal pathway is affected in LRRK DKO brains during aging we evaluated p62, an autophagy substrate that binds to ubiquitin and forms complexes with LC3 (Bjørkøy et al., 2005Bjørkøy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Øvervatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. p62/SQSTM1 forms protein aggregates degraded by autophagy and has a protective effect on huntingtin-induced cell death.J.

Selective turnover of p62/A170/SQSTM1 by autophagy.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We found significant increases of p62 immunoreactivity in different brain sub-regions, including the SNpc, striatum, neocortex, and optic tract in LRRK DKO mice at 15 months (Figures 6A and 6B ). Western analysis also showed significant increases of p62 in the dissected striatum, neocortex, and optic nerve of LRRK DKO mice at 15 months (Figures 6C–6E). We did not detect significant alterations in p62 immunoreactivity in the SNpc and striatum of LRRK1 and LRRK2 single-KO at 15 months of age (Figures S5A and S5B). Immunohistochemical analysis also showed co-localization of p62 and ubiquitin immunoreactivity in the optic tract of LRRK DKO mice at 15 months (Figure 6G). We further examined conversion of LC3-I, a homolog of Atg8 (Kabeya et al., 2000Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), to the lipidated form, LC3-II, which is essential for the formation of autophagosomes and is a marker of autophagosome formation and accumulation (Mizushima et al., 2010Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Levine B. Methods in mammalian autophagy research.Cell. 2010; 140: 313-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3532) Google Scholar). We observed significant decreases of LC3-I levels and increases of LC3-II levels in the optic tract of LRRK DKO mice at 15 months (Figures 6E and 6F), further indicating autophagy impairment. We further performed transmission EM analysis of LRRK DKO and wild-type neurons in the SNpc at the ages of 3, 10, and 15 months and found age-dependent accumulation of electron-dense autophagic vacuoles in LRRK DKO neurons (Figure 7). At 3 months, there are very few electron-dense vacuoles and the number is not significantly different between LRRK DKO and wild-type neurons in the SNpc (Figures 7A, 7D, and 7K). At 10 months, more electron-dense vacuoles were found in LRRK DKO neurons relative to controls (Figures 7B, 7E, and 7K). At 15 months of age, the number of electron-dense vacuoles is further increased in LRRK DKO neurons compared to wild-type neurons (Figures 7C,7F, and 7K). Higher-magnification views further revealed the presence of both autophagosome and autolysosome vacuoles in LRRK DKO neurons at 10 and 15 months of age (Figures 7G–7J). We also observed large electron-dense lipofuscin granules composed of lipid components defined as largely round lipid vacuoles (Figures 7G–7J). These ultrastructural changes are consistent with age-dependent impairment of autophagic activity (Figure 6), demonstrating that loss of LRRK results in accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and lipofuscin granules, leading to impaired protein/lipid degradation and autophagy function in aging neurons in the SNpc. Mutations in LRRK2 are collectively the most common genetic cause of PD, associated with both familial and sporadic cases (Nalls et al., 2014Nalls M.A. Pankratz N. Lill C.M. Do C.B. Hernandez D.G.

https://openalex.org/W2766414693,"The gut microbiota contributes to the development of normal immunity but, when dysregulated, can promote autoimmunity through various non-antigen-specific effects on pathogenic and regulatory lymphocytes. Here, we show that an integrase expressed by several species of the gut microbial genus Bacteroides encodes a low-avidity mimotope of the pancreatic β cell autoantigen islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase-catalytic-subunit-related protein (IGRP206-214). Studies in germ-free mice monocolonized with integrase-competent, integrase-deficient, and integrase-transgenic Bacteroides demonstrate that the microbial epitope promotes the recruitment of diabetogenic CD8+ T cells to the gut. There, these effectors suppress colitis by targeting microbial antigen-loaded, antigen-presenting cells in an integrin β7-, perforin-, and major histocompatibility complex class I-dependent manner. Like their murine counterparts, human peripheral blood T cells also recognize Bacteroides integrase. These data suggest that gut microbial antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells may have therapeutic value in inflammatory bowel disease and unearth molecular mimicry as a novel mechanism by which the gut microbiota can regulate normal immune homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2743269545,"Reactivation of hippocampal place cell sequences during behavioral immobility and rest has been linked with both memory consolidation and navigational planning. Yet it remains to be investigated whether these functions are temporally segregated, occurring during different behavioral states. During a self-paced spatial task, awake hippocampal replay occurring either immediately before movement toward a reward location or just after arrival at a reward location preferentially involved cells consistent with the current trajectory. In contrast, during periods of extended immobility, no such biases were evident. Notably, the occurrence of task-focused reactivations predicted the accuracy of subsequent spatial decisions. Additionally, during immobility, but not periods preceding or succeeding movement, grid cells in deep layers of the entorhinal cortex replayed coherently with the hippocampus. Thus, hippocampal reactivations dynamically and abruptly switch between operational modes in response to task demands, plausibly moving from a state favoring navigational planning to one geared toward memory consolidation."

In CNS neurons and many other cell types, calcium (Ca2+) signaling controls a variety of fundamental processes and reaction pathways including release of transmitters and hormones, regulation of enzymatic activities and excitability, excitation-transcription coupling, contraction or cell motility, and neurite outgrowth (Clapham, 2007Clapham D.E. Calcium signaling.Cell. 2007; 131: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). All of these processes are switched on by influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol, mostly through voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels or Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, and they are switched off by the concerted action of various Ca2+ transporters that extrude Ca2+ from the cytoplasm (Augustine et al., 2003Augustine G.J.

Bootman M.D. The versatility and universality of calcium signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4424) Google Scholar). Key elements among the latter are the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs), P-type ATPases (or pumps) that are present in virtually all types of cells and transport Ca2+ to the extracellular space using ATP as an energy source (Brini and Carafoli, 2009Brini M. Carafoli E. Calcium pumps in health and disease.Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 1341-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar).

Interestingly, all four PMCA isoforms were identified as constituents of the extended protein networks building the nano-environment(s) of voltage-gated Ca2+ (Cav) channels in the brain, thus indicating intimate coupling of influx and clearance of Ca2+ for spatiotemporally defined Ca2+ signaling (Müller et al., 2010Müller C.S. Haupt A. Bildl W. Schindler J. Knaus H.G. Meissner M. Rammner B. Striessnig J. Flockerzi V. Fakler B. Schulte U.

As yet, however, the molecular details underlying integration of PMCAs into the protein networks of Cav channels, as well as the molecular appearance of PMCAs in native membranes, have not been resolved. Here we use multi-epitope and knockout-controlled affinity purifications (APs) together with high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) and cryo-slicing BN-MS to investigate the subunit composition of native PMCAs in various types of cells and tissues. Our analyses identify native PMCAs as heteromers assembled from PMCA1–4 proteins and the Ig-domain containing proteins neuroplastin and basigin. Subsequent functional studies on wild-type and knockout cells or knockout tissue, as well as virally transduced neurons, establish neuroplastin and basigin together as obligatory auxiliary subunits of PMCA complexes that control stability and processing of the complexes, as well as their Ca2+ transport capacity. To characterize native PMCAs, we applied our proteomic approach combining antibody (AB)-based affinity purifications (APs) with high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) (Müller et al., 2010Müller C.S.

Strikingly, this initial experiment performed with membrane fractions from rodent brain revealed that two different ABs against PMCAs1–4 (anti-PMCA-a, -b, see also STAR Methods, Figure S1A) co-purified the single transmembrane domain protein neuroplastin in amounts equal to that of the target(s), suggesting that neuroplastin co-assembles with the ATPases (Figure 1A). Neuroplastin, originally identified as a synaptic glycoprotein (Hill et al., 1988Hill I.E. Selkirk C.P. Hawkes R.B. Beesley P.W.

USA. 2000; 97: 4327-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), is a member of an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain-containing family of proteins together with basigin (also known as CD147 or EMMPRIN) and embigin (Figure 1B; (Beesley et al., 2014Beesley P.W.

In the rodent brain, neuroplastin exists in two splice variations, Np65 and Np55, which differ by a single Ig domain at the extracellular N terminus of the protein (Figure 1B). Interestingly, basigin was also co-purified in both initial anti-PMCA APs, albeit at amounts markedly lower than those of neuroplastin, while embigin was not detected (Figure 1A) despite its expression in the rodent brain (Figure S1B). Native PMCA complexes were further analyzed in experiments using cryo-slicing BN-MS (Müller et al., 2016Müller C.S. Bildl W. Haupt A. Ellenrieder L. Becker T. Hunte C. Fakler B. Schulte U.

The abundance-mass profiles obtained with membrane preparations from brain and kidney demonstrated that neuroplastin precisely co-segregated with the PMCA isoforms indicating stable complex formation in both rodent tissues (Figure 1C). Moreover, the profiles showed that the total amount of neuroplastin (area under profile) approximately equals the summed amounts of all PMCAs expressed in either tissue (PMCA1–4 in brain, PMCA1, 4 in kidney) and that basigin only associates with a minor portion of the PMCAs (Figure 1C). Instead, basigin appeared predominantly incorporated into smaller complexes with the mono-carboxylate transporters (MCTs) 1, 2 (Figure 1C) in line with previous reports (Kirk et al., 2000Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P.

For more comprehensive insight into the role of neuroplastin and basigin, we next aimed to resolve their proteomes (or interactomes), the ensemble of their interaction partners, in the rodent brain using several ABs for target-depleting APs and target knockout tissues as negative controls for judging specificity of interactions (Igakura et al., 1996Igakura T.

Notably, neuroplastin and basigin were not detected in anti-basigin and anti-neuroplastin APs (Figure S1B), respectively, indicating mutual exclusivity of both proteins in their co-assembly with the PMCA1–4 subunits. The remaining constituents of either proteome, mostly proteins with reported localization to the synaptic compartment, specifically interact with the two target proteins although at comparatively low abundance (∼3% of total abundance, Table S1). With respect to PMCAs, the following observations are important. First, the neuroplastin-PMCA interaction was sensitive to solubilization conditions (Figure S2), most likely as a consequence of the interaction site(s) involving the transmembrane domain, a few adjacent N-terminal residues, and the cytoplasmic C terminus of neuroplastin (Figure S3, NPTN ΔIgDs). Second, the ratio of neuroplastin versus basigin as subunits of native PMCA complexes was variable among tissues and cell types; while neuroplastin exceeded basigin by far in rodent brain and kidney (ratio estimates of ∼30/1, Figures 1 and 2), the respective ratio appeared decreased in cultured cells (∼4/1 in CHO- and tsA-201/HEK293-cells) or even reversed in human erythrocytes (∼1/30; data not shown). The number of neuroplastin proteins assembled into individual PMCA complexes was determined in AB-shift assays. As shown in Figure 2B and Figure S4, anti-neuroplastin-a ABs or PMCA-specific ABs added to solubilized membrane fractions from rodent brain prior to native gel electrophoresis shifted the PMCA complexes to higher molecular masses, with the two distinct increments most likely reflecting co-assembly of two neuroplastins with two PMCA subunits (Figure 2B, left; Figure S4). Together with the complexes’ apparent mass of about 350 kDa, this pointed to native PMCAs as heterotetramers of two ATPase subunits and two neuroplastin or basigin molecules, similar to the stoichiometry suggested for MCT1-basigin assemblies (Wilson et al., 2002Wilson M.C. Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies on the interaction between the lactate transporter MCT1 and CD147 provide information on the topology and stoichiometry of the complex in situ.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3666-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Notably, the small portion of basigin-containing PMCAs, lower in mass than their neuroplastin-containing counterparts, remained unaffected (Figure 2B, right) in the neuroplastin shift assay, confirming the mutual exclusivity in assembly of neuroplastin and basigin into PMCA complexes seen before in AP experiments (Figure 2A). Together, our proteomic analyses indicated that native PMCAs, instead of being monomers or homodimers as previously envisaged (Brini et al., 2013Brini M. Calì T. Ottolini D. Carafoli E.

A bimodular mechanism of calcium control in eukaryotes.Nature. 2012; 491: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), are heteromeric complexes assembled from the ATPase subunits PMCAs1–4 and either of the two auxiliary subunits neuroplastin or basigin. Next, we investigated the impact of neuroplastin and basigin on PMCA function and Ca2+ levels in culture cells where expression of endogenous and exogenous PMCA constituents could be readily manipulated. We used current recordings from BKCa-type Ca2+-activated K+ channels to readout apparent intracellular Ca2+ concentrations at the plasma membrane ([Ca2+]i) without affecting cellular buffer systems (Fakler and Adelman, 2008Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Control of K(Ca) channels by calcium nano/microdomains.Neuron. 2008; 59: 873-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Steady-state activation curves of BKCa channels determined in control cells with defined Ca2+ concentrations in the patch pipette ([Ca2+]pip from 0.1–50 μM) served as calibration standards (Figure 3A). As illustrated in Figure 3A, exogenous expression of PMCA2 decreased [Ca2+]i by about an order of magnitude as reflected by the right shift in the BKCa activation curve measured with a [Ca2+]pip of 10 μM (blue symbols). Conversely, knockout of endogenous neuroplastin via CRISPR/Cas9 led to an about 5-fold increase in [Ca2+]i that is evidenced by the left shift in BKCa activation (red symbols, Figure 3A) and resulted from an about 70% decrease in the amount of PMCAs in membranes of the knockout cells (NPTN−/−, Figure 3B). In line with these alterations, expression of exogenous neuroplastin or basigin resulted in a strong decrease in [Ca2+]i, which was further extended in either case by additional co-expression of PMCA2 (Figures 3C and 3D). More explicitly, the shift in BKCa activation observed in both co-expression experiments was equivalent to a decrease of [Ca2+]i underneath the plasma membrane by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the value set by [Ca2+]pip (Figures 3C and 3D). Notably, the PMCA-mediated decrease in submembrane [Ca2+]i was strongly dependent on intracellular ATP, as reflected by the left shift in the activation curves observed upon wash-out of ATP via dialysis of the CHO cells with ATP-free intracellular solution (Figure S5). Together, these experiments demonstrated the large impact of PMCA-mediated Ca2+ transport on [Ca2+]i under steady-state conditions and strongly suggested that neuroplastin and basigin may be important regulators for both PMCA and [Ca2+]i. This was further investigated by probing the expression of neuroplastin and basigin in the rodent brain both during postnatal development and after knockout of neuroplastin. The BN-PAGE separations in Figure 4A show that the total amount of neuroplastin dramatically increased over the postnatal period from P1 to P28 and that this increase was paralleled by the increase in total PMCA1–4 protein (in complexed form). In contrast, the total amount of basigin remained roughly constant on the aforementioned time window, while separation between MCT- and PMCA-associated pools of basigin was observed after P7 (Figure 4A, bottom). The minor contribution of basigin-associated PMCAs to total PMCA complexes seen in adult rats (Figures 1C and 2B) was recapitulated in wild-type mice (Figure 4B, top). After knockout of neuroplastin (NPTN−/−); however, this picture profoundly changed. The pool of basigin protein assembled into PMCA complexes appeared strongly enhanced in membrane fractions from whole brain, while the MCT-associated population remained unaffected (Figure 4B, top). This compensatory increase of basigin protein was also observed in immunostainings performed in cerebellar slices from wild-type and NPTN−/− animals (Figure 4B, bottom; for specificity of ABs see Figures S6 and S7A). While basigin displayed weak staining in wild-type tissue, prominent staining was observed in NPTN−/− animals, where it closely resembled the staining pattern obtained for neuroplastin in wild-type slices, particularly on the plasma membrane of cerebellar Purkinje cell dendrites (Figure 4B, bottom). Further analysis by quantitative immuno-EM on SDS-digested freeze-fracture replicas confirmed the increase of basigin protein in the plasma membrane of neuroplastin knockout neurons (Figure 5A, bottom) but also showed that this compensatory increase failed to restore the PMCA levels of wild-type neurons. Thus, the densities of PMCA particles in NPTN−/− neurons were found to be 2- to 3-fold below wild-type level(s) (Figure 5A, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells; Figure 5B, cerebellar Purkinje cells, mean [±SEM] values were 196 ± 10 and 65 ± 8 in 4 dendrites of WT and NPTN−/−, respectively), in good agreement with the changes in total PMCA protein obtained from MS analyses of respective membrane fractions (Figure S8A). In addition, the EM analyses revealed two further interesting observations: first, the density of PMCAs was largely different between distinct types of neurons (dendrites of Purkinje cells versus dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells; Figures 5A and 5B) and, second, PMCAs 1 and 2 exhibited a clear preference for the postsynaptic compartment (Figure 5B, axon terminal versus dendritic shaft and spines).Figure 5Density of PMCA at the Plasma Membrane Is Neuron-Type Specific and Reduced after Deletion of NeuroplastinShow full caption(A) Left: electron micrographs showing distribution of immunoparticles for PMCA1, PMCA2, and Basigin on the extrasynaptic plasma membrane of dendritic shafts (Den) of CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampi of WT and NPTN−/− mice.

Ax, pre-terminal axon of parallel fibers; arrowheads denote PMCA2 particles. Scale bars represent 200 nm. The compensatory increase in basigin amounts (and association with PMCAs) following loss of neuroplastin suggested that native PMCAs may require at least one of its two auxiliary subunits for structural and functional integrity. We, therefore, sought to analyze PMCAs after abolishing both neuroplastin and basigin either via CRISPR/Cas9-induced knockout in cultured CHO and tsA201 (HEK293) cells or via protein knockdown by virally driven sh-RNAs in neuronal cultures. Figures 6A and 6B (also Supplemental Information, Figures S7B and S8B) illustrate that in either case the amount of PMCAs determined in respective membrane fractions by MS-based quantification or western blotting was drastically reduced (to ∼5% [culture cells] and 9% [neuronal cultures] of control, respectively) and that the PMCA-mediated Ca2+ transport was largely abolished. The latter is reflected by the BKCa activation curve of double knockout cells that closely matched the activation curve recorded upon washout of ATP (control data and green line, Figure 6B). Interestingly, in the absence of neuroplastin and basigin, even (over)-expression of PMCA2 led to only partial restoration of Ca2+ transport with BKCa activation shifted far less to the right than observed in CHO wild-type cells (Figure 3A) or with co-expression of both PMCA2 and neuroplastin (Figure 6B). While these results indicated that Ca2+ may be transported by PMCA2 alone, they also showed that co-assembly with neuroplastin or basigin is required for stability of PMCA complexes and their effective trafficking to the plasma membrane, most likely via co-assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This was directly tested in NPTN−/− cells by expression of a neuroplastin fusion protein that is retained in the ER (see STAR Methods). In contrast to wild-type protein, ER-retained neuroplastin effectively prevented surface delivery of (endogenous) PMCA complexes (biotinylation assay, inset Figure 7A) and largely reduced Ca2+ transport (minor shift of the BKCa activation curve; Figure 7A). Conversely, both, surface delivery and effective Ca2+ transport, did not require the entire neuroplastin protein, but rather the transmembrane domain and adjacent N- and C-terminal residues determined as minimal sites for PMCA-neuroplastin interaction (Figure S3).

He also exhibits advanced external auditory exostoses in his left auditory meatus and larger ones with complete bridging across the porus in the right meatus (both Grade 3). These growths indicate at least unilateral conductive hearing (CHL) loss, a serious sensory deprivation for a Pleistocene hunter-gatherer. This condition joins the meatal atresia of the Middle Pleistocene Atapuerca-SH Cr.4 in providing evidence of survival with conductive hearing loss (and hence serious sensory deprivation) among these Pleistocene humans. The presence of CHL in these fossils thereby reinforces the paleobiological and archeological evidence for supporting social matrices among these Pleistocene foraging peoples."

Propolis, a resinous product of worker honeybees, possesses several biological activities that could be used to alleviate the deleterious effects of high environmental temperature on poultry production. The current study was aimed at evaluating the effects of propolis supplementation to Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) diets on the production performance, intestinal histomorphology, relative physiological and immunological parameters, and selected gene expression under heat stress conditions. Three hundred one-day-old Japanese quail chicks were randomly distributed into 20 wired-cages. At 28 d of age, the birds were divided into 2 temperature treatment groups; a normal at 24°C (C group) and a heat stress at 35°C (HS group). The birds in each group were further assigned to 2 subgroups; one of them was fed on a basal diet without propolis supplementation (-Pr subgroup) while the other was supplemented with propolis (+Pr subgroup). Production performance including body weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were measured. The intestinal histomorphological measurements were also performed for all treatment groups. Relative physiological parameters including body temperature, corticosterone hormone level, malondialdehyde (MDA) and free triiodothyronine hormone (fT3), as well as the relative immunological parameters including the total white blood cells count (TWBC's), heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio and lymphocyte proliferation index, were also measured. Furthermore, the mRNA expression for toll like receptor 5 (TLR5), cysteine-aspartic protease-6 (CASP6) and heat shock proteins 70 and 90 (Hsp70 and Hsp90) genes was quantified in this study. The quail production performance was significantly (P<0.05) impaired by HS treatment, while Pr treatment significantly improved the quail production performance. The villus width and area were significantly (P<0.05) lower in the HS compared to the C group, while Pr treatment significantly increased crypts depth of quail. A negative impact of HS treatment was observed on the physiological status of quail; however, propolis significantly alleviated this negative effect. Moreover, quail of the HS group expressed lower immunological parameters than C group, while propolis enhanced the immune status of the quail. The relative mRNA expression of TLR5 gene was down-regulated by HS treatment while it was up-regulated by the Pr treatment. Furthermore, the positive effects of propolis in HS-quail were evidenced by normalizing the high expressions of CASP6 and Hsp70 genes when compared to the C group. Based on these results, the addition of propolis to quail diets as a potential nutritional strategy in order to improve their performance, especially under heat stress conditions, is recommended."

Here, we generated ES cells with single or combined disruption of polycomb group RING finger protein 3 (Pcgf3) and Pcgf5 with the CRISPR-Cas9 technique. We report that although these mutant cells maintained their self-renewal and colony-forming capacity, they displayed severe defects in mesoderm differentiation in vitro and in vivo.

PRC2 consists of the core subunits Eed, Suz12, and Ezh1/2 and di- and trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me2/3) (9Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Jones R.S.

PRC1 can be distinguished based on their subcomponent composition as canonical and non-canonical PRC1.

Cell. 2014; 28: 94-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism of PcG-mediated gene activation remains largely unknown. Of note, Auts2, a component of PRC1.5, has recently been shown to render this complex capable of activating transcription through its recruitment of Ck2 and interaction with p300 in developing neuronal cells (16Gao Z. Lee P. Stafford J.M. von Schimmelmann M. Schaefer A. Reinberg D. An AUTS2-Polycomb complex activates gene expression in the CNS.Nature. 2014; 516: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although recent studies implicate L(3)73Ah, a homolog of mammalian Pcgf3, in regulating global H2AK118ub1 level in Drosophila, by forming a dimer with Ring1 (17Lee H.-G. Kahn T.G. Simcox A. Schwartz Y.B. Pirrotta V. Genome-wide activities of Polycomb complexes control pervasive transcription.Genome Res. 2015; 25: 1170-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the function of Pcgf3 and Pcgf5 in mammals remains to be determined. Here, we generated ES cells with single or combined disruption of Pcgf3/5 via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic engineering. We showed that although Pcgf3 or Pcgf5 mutant cells are viable and retain their typical undifferentiated ES cell morphology, loss of Pcgf3 or Pcgf5 impairs proper differentiation of ES cells into mesoderm in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, Pcgf3/5 protein complexes in ES cells are purified using a biochemical-based affinity purification and subsequently analyzed by means of MS. We find that Pcgf3/5 can form novel non-canonical PRC1 complexes that contain Ck2s (Ck2a1, Ck2a2, and Ck2b) and Tex10 in ES cells. Finally, we show that p300 is recruited to Pcgf3/5 target genes through its interaction with Tex10 and might contribute to transcriptional activation. To explore the function of Pcgf3 and Pcgf5 in the maintenance of ES cells, we first generated Pcgf3 or Pcgf5 knockout ES cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique (18Ran F.A. Hsu P.D. Wright J. Agarwala V. Scott D.A. Zhang F. Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8: 2281-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (6409) Google Scholar). To delete the region encoding the RING finger motif and introduce a frameshift, we designed two single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) specifically flanking exon 2 of the mouse Pcgf3 or Pcgf5 gene. Independent ES cell clones were isolated, and genomic deletions were confirmed by PCR with primers outside the expected cleavage site (19Zhao W. Tong H. Huang Y. Yan Y. Teng H. Xia Y. Jiang Q. Qin J. Essential role for Polycomb group protein Pcgf6 in embryonic stem cell maintenance and a noncanonical polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) integrity.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 2773-2784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1). Western blot analysis revealed complete loss of Pcgf3 or Pcgf5 proteins in targeted deletion mutant ES cells, and no truncated proteins were detected (Fig. 1A). Pcgf3 and Pcgf5 share 57.9% amino acid homology and are found in complexes with similar subunit composition (see below). To test for possible functional redundancy between Pcgf3 and Pcgf5 in ES cells, we also generated ES cells with double knockout of the genes for Pcgf3 and Pcgf5. ES cells with single or double knockout of Pcgf3/5 were viable and retained the normal ability to form a typical undifferentiated ES cell colony after being seeded on mitomycin-C-irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Furthermore, colony size of different mutants was comparable with that of wild type (Fig. 1, B and C). Immunoblotting of the pluripotent factors indicated that knockout of Pcgf3, Pcgf5, or both in ES cells did not significantly alter the protein levels of the core pluripotency markers Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 (Fig. 1D), consistent with the undifferentiated morphology observed in these mutants. Notably, an identical phenotype was obtained from each of the four independently derived clones of ES cells deficient in Pcgf3/5 either alone or together (Fig. S1). In addition, a very similar phenotype was observed in Pcgf2 (Mel18) or Pcgf4 (Bmi1), core components of canonical PRC1 complexes PRC1.2 and PRC1.4, respectively, knockout ES cells (Fig. 1B and Figs. S2 and S3). These observations, together with our previous findings (19Zhao W. Tong H. Huang Y. Yan Y. Teng H. Xia Y. Jiang Q. Qin J.

Rep. 2017; 7: 46276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), strongly suggest that all PCGF family members except for Pcgf6 are dispensable for the self-renewal of ES cells. Embryoid bodies (EBs) mimic early development of the embryo and are often used as an in vitro differentiation assay to test ES cell pluripotency (21Evans M.J. Kaufman M.H. Establishment in culture of pluripotential cells from mouse embryos.Nature. 1981; 292: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6429) Google Scholar). Our previous study revealed that loss of Pcgf1 severely impairs ES cell differentiation in vitro, mainly due to a failure to initiate the proper differentiation program, and Pcgf6 mutant ES cells display skewed differentiation toward endoderm lineage in EBs (19Zhao W. Tong H. Huang Y. Yan Y. Teng H. Xia Y. Jiang Q. Qin J.

Loss of Polycomb group protein Pcgf1 severely compromises proper differentiation of embryonic stem cells.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 46276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Additionally, Pcgf2 has been described as being important for cardiac development and differentiation in vitro by knockdown of Pcgf2 in ES cells (22Morey L. Santanach A. Blanco E. Aloia L. Nora E.P. Bruneau B.G. Di Croce L. Polycomb regulates mesoderm cell fate-specification in embryonic stem cells through activation and repression mechanisms.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 17: 300-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To test whether Pcgf3 or Pcgf5 plays a role in ES cell differentiation, the mutant and wild-type ES cells were cultured without feeder cells and leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) to aggregate in hanging drops to form EBs. Specifically, wild-type, Pcgf3/5 single and double knockout ES cells were cultured in hanging drops for 3 days and subsequently maintained in rotating conditions without LIF, where cells differentiated into the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). EB morphology was examined by microscopy (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, the mutant ES cells retained their ability to form EBs of a size similar to those derived from control cells. Total RNA was isolated from ES cells and EBs at 3, 7, and 12 days of culture, followed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) analysis of core pluripotency gene transcript levels as well as markers of lineage-specific differentiation. Expression of the core pluripotency markers Oct4 and Nanog was efficiently down-regulated, whereas the lineage-specific differentiation markers, including endodermal (Gata6 and Foxa2), ectodermal (Fgf5 and Nestin), and mesodermal (Brachyury, Flk1, and Nkx2-5) markers, were up-regulated during the differentiation process, consistent with the onset of the differentiation program in both mutant and wild-type cells. Importantly, throughout mutant EB culture, all mutants showed markedly decreased expression levels of mesoderm markers with respect to control EBs, whereas no differences in the levels of endoderm and ectoderm markers were observed between mutants and wild type (Fig. 2C), indicating that Pcgf3/5 are necessary for proper mesodermal lineage differentiation during EB culture. Notably, Pcgf3/5 double knockout EBs displayed more pronounced decrease in the expression of mesoderm markers than any of the corresponding single mutants, suggesting that Pcgf3/5 have partially redundant functions during EB differentiation (Fig. 2C). We also checked the protein levels of those germ layer markers in differentiated EBs and found that protein levels of mesoderm markers, including Brachyury and Flk1, were dramatically decreased in differentiated EBs at day 12 with respect to control (Fig. S4). However, no differences in the protein levels of ectoderm marker Nestin were observed between mutants and wild type. Remarkably, lentiviral expression of FLAG-tagged Pcgf3/5 was able to rescue the protein levels of mesoderm markers to levels similar to those in control cells (Fig. S4), indicating that the observed differentiation phenotypes are caused by Pcgf3/5 deficiencies. Furthermore, to assess whether Pcgf3/5 knockout ES cells give rise to terminally differentiated cells, these cells were subcutaneously injected into immune-deficient mice. Immunohistochemistry of wild-type ES cell-derived teratomas with antibody specific to α-smooth muscle actin (SMA; mesoderm marker) revealed large numbers of SMA-positive cells, whereas teratomas derived from ES cells with Pcgf3/5 single or combined loss had marked decreases in SMA-positive cells. Notably, Pcgf3/5 ablation has no effect on endoderm and ectoderm specification, as evidenced by TROMA1 and GFAP staining, respectively (Fig. S5). Taken together, Pcgf3 and Pcgf5 have a redundant but essential role in ES cell mesoderm differentiation in vitro and in vivo. To probe the molecular mechanisms that underlie the differentiation phenotypes of Pcgf3/5-null ES cells, RNA extracted from Pcgf3−/−, Pcgf5−/−, Pcgf3−/−/Pcgf5−/−, and wild-type ES cells was subjected to RNA-seq. Total mRNA from two independent biological replicates of Pcgf3−/−, Pcgf5−/−, and Pcgf3−/−/Pcgf5−/− cells were used for paired-end sequencing. As shown in Table S3, 318 differentially expressed genes were determined by comparing the Pcgf3 knockout and wild-type ES cells (102 up-regulated and 216 (68%) down-regulated genes), as determined by 2-fold cut-off, whereas 279 genes between the Pcgf5 knockout and wild-type ES cells were differentially expressed (80 up-regulated and 199 (71%) down-regulated genes) (Fig. 3, A and B). Notably, the Pcgf3−/− and Pcgf5−/− lists also exhibited significant overlap with each other (Fig. 3C). Analysis of the transcriptional profiling of Pcgf3/5 double mutant revealed a 30% increase in the number of genes significantly differentially expressed in the double mutant compared with the Pcgf3/5 single mutants (346 Pcgf3/5-dependent genes compared with 318 Pcgf3 or 279 Pcgf5-dependent genes) (Fig. 3C). Moreover, >70% of the genes significantly differentially expressed in the double mutant were down-regulated compared with wild type (Fig. 3A and Table S3). Based on gene ontology (GO) term analysis, there is no significant enrichment for specific functional categories or cellular processes within the Pcgf3/5-repressed genes. However, GO analysis of the down-regulated genes in Pcgf3−/− or Pcgf5−/−, especially Pcgf3/5 double mutants, scored them as being statistically associated with mesoderm differentiation genes (e.g. cartilage development, blood vessel morphogenesis, and heart morphogenesis) (Fig. 3D), suggesting a particular role for Pcgf3/5 in mesoderm cell fate. Thus, these results strongly suggest that Pcgf3/5 predominantly act as transcriptional activators in ES cells. Overall, our data not only support the conclusion that Pcgf3 and Pcgf5 largely regulate the similar set of downstream genes, but also provide a molecular interpretation for the redundancy of Pcgf3 and Pcgf5 in ES cell differentiation. Previous proteomic approaches identified Pcgf3 and Pcgf5 as components of non-canonical PRC1 complexes designated as PRC1.3 or PRC1.5, respectively, which contain Ring1B associated with Ck2, Rybp, and Auts2 in 293T-REx cells (12Gao Z. Zhang J. Bonasio R. Strino F. Sawai A. Parisi F. Kluger Y. Reinberg D. PCGF homologs, CBX proteins, and RYBP define functionally distinct PRC1 family complexes.Mol. Cell. 2012; 45: 344-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). To address the composition of PRC1.3 or PRC1.5 complexes in ES cells, we stably expressed a C-terminal FLAG-tagged form of Pcgf3 or Pcgf5 in Pcgf3−/− or Pcgf5−/− ES cells, respectively; affinity-purified it from nuclear extracts; and then used mass spectrometric analysis to determine associated proteins. MS analysis showed that Pcgf3/5 were strongly associated with core components of PRC1, including Ring1A/B, Rybp, and its homologue Yaf2, along with Wdr68, Fbrs, and casein kinase 2 (Ck2a1, Ck2a2, and Ck2b), which are unrelated to PRC1 (Fig. 4, A and B). As reported previously, Pcgf5 interacted with Auts2 in neurons and 293T-Rex cells (12Gao Z. Zhang J. Bonasio R. Strino F. Sawai A. Parisi F. Kluger Y. Reinberg D. PCGF homologs, CBX proteins, and RYBP define functionally distinct PRC1 family complexes.Mol. Cell. 2012; 45: 344-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 16Gao Z.

An AUTS2-Polycomb complex activates gene expression in the CNS.Nature. 2014; 516: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar); however, we failed to detect any Auts2 from the Pcgf3/5 immunoprecipitates. As is consistent with previous studies, Pcgf3 and Pcgf5 were mutually exclusive, given that immunoprecipitation of Pcgf3 did not recover Pcgf5 and vice versa (Fig. 4, B and C). Next, immunoprecipitation experiments performed with nuclear extract of mutant ES cells reexpressing FLAG-tagged Pcgf3 or Pcgf5 and antibody against FLAG confirmed Pcgf3 or Pcgf5 association with Ring1A/B, Rybp, Ck2s, Tex10, Las1L, and Pelp1. As expected, other PcG components not associated with PRC1.3 or PRC1.5, such as Pcgf6 and Suz12, comprising PRC1.6 and PRC2, respectively, did not precipitate with Pcgf3 or Pcgf5 (Fig. 4C). To further confirm the interaction between Pcgf3/5 and Ck2s, we performed a reverse co-immunoprecipitation assay, with the results showing Pcgf3/5 but not Pcgf6 protein existing in the complex pulled down by the anti-FLAG antibody in wild-type ES cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged Ck2s (Ck2a1, Ck2a2, and Ck2b). Notably, our experiments showed that all Ck2 proteins (Ck2a1, Ck2a2, and Ck2b) interact with Pcgf3 and Pcgf5 by an immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 4D), although some were missed in our mass spectrometric analysis (Fig. 4B). Most importantly, several proteins, including Tex10, Las1L, and Pelp1, were also recovered in Pcgf3 or Pcgf5 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, Tex10, Las1L, and Pelp1 together with Senp3 and Wdr18 form a previously characterized complex referred to as five friends of methylated Chtop (5FMC) (23Fanis P. Gillemans N. Aghajanirefah A. Pourfarzad F. Demmers J. Esteghamat F. Vadlamudi R.K. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. van Dijk T.B. Five friends of methylated chromatin target of protein-arginine-methyltransferase [prmt]-1 (chtop), a complex linking arginine methylation to desumoylation.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2012; 11: 1263-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation was performed to verify the interaction between Pcgf3/5 and 5FMC complex in ES cells. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-Tex10 in ES cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged Tex10 allowed the coprecipitation of Las1L, Pelp1, and Pcgf3/5, as evidenced by Western blotting analysis. Additionally, p300 was found in Tex10 precipitates (Fig. 4E), consistent with a previous study showing the interaction between Tex10 and p300 to control the histone acetylation (24Ding J. Huang X. Shao N. Zhou H. Lee D.-F. Faiola F. Fidalgo M. Guallar D. Saunders A. Shliaha P.V. Wang H. Waghray A. Papatsenko D. Sánchez-Priego C. Li D. et al.Tex10 coordinates epigenetic control of super-enhancer activity in pluripotency and reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16: 653-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In summary, we have widened the set of multiunit Pcgf3/5 complexes in ES cells, and the new interactors, especially Tex10, Las1L, and Pelp1, might render these complexes capable of activating transcription not typically characterized as PcG functions. As mentioned above, Pcgf3/5 predominantly activate transcription in ES cells, and mass spectrometric analysis further revealed that the Pcgf3/5 complex contains components involved in transcription activation. However, the contributions of these new components to Pcgf3/5-mediated transcription remain to be determined. To examine the local impact of Pcgf3/5 on chromatin features at promoters, we probed a panel of target genes enriched in mesodermal differentiation (Wisp1, Lhx9, Acta1, Sp5, Meis1, and Tgfb1), selected from genome-wide RNA-seq analysis, whose expression was down-regulated after Pcgf3/5 deletion. In particular, Wisp1 is involved in the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (25Liu H. Dong W. Lin Z. Lu J. Wan H. Zhou Z. Liu Z. CCN4 regulates vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation.Mol. Cells. 2013; 36: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Lhx9 is implicated in the correct development of many organs, including gonads, limbs, and heart (26Yang Y. Wilson M.J.

Acta1 is found in muscle tissues and is a major constituent of the contractile apparatus (29Gunning P.W. Ferguson V. Brennan K.J. Hardeman E.C. α-skeletal actin induces a subset of muscle genes independently of muscle differentiation and withdrawal from the cell cycle.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 513-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sp5 is dynamically expressed during development and genetically interacts with Brachyury (30Harrison S.M. Houzelstein D. Dunwoodie S.L.

Biol. 2000; 227: 358-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Meis1 is required for definitive hematopoiesis and vascular patterning (31Azcoitia V. Aracil M. Martínez-A C. Torres M. The homeodomain protein Meis1 is essential for definitive hematopoiesis and vascular patterning in the mouse embryo.Dev. Biol. 2005; 280: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Tgfb1 is required for hematopoiesis and endothelial differentiation (32Dickson M.C. Martin J.S. Cousins F.M. Kulkarni A.B. Karlsson S. Akhurst R.J. Defective haematopoiesis and vasculogenesis in transforming growth factor-β1 knock out mice.Development. 1995; 121: 1845-1854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their differential expression and Pcgf3/5-binding status in undifferentiated and differentiating ES cells were verified by RT-qPCR and ChIP-qPCR analyses (Fig. 5 (B and C) and Fig. S6). Next, we probed promoters of these Pcgf3/5 target genes for the presence of key components of PRC1.3 or PRC1.5 complex. Indeed, Ring1B, Rybp, and Tex10 were highly enriched at these target gene promoters (Fig. 5D), strongly suggesting that Pcgf3/5 and their associated PRC1 complexes target the developmental genes directly in ES cells. As Pcgf3/5 can physically associate with the PRC1.3/5 core components and also co-occupy the promoters of developmental genes in ES cells, it may contribute to the recruitment of these complexes to the promoters of these target genes. To investigate this possibility, we performed ChIP-qPCR analyses for Ring1B and Rybp under control and Pcgf3/5 single- or double-deleted conditions and compared their pr"
https://openalex.org/W2765819699,"Introduction Many people at high risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), e.g., men who have sex with men (MSM), are not optimally reached by current sexual health care systems with testing. To facilitate testing by home-based sampling or sampling in outreach setting we evaluated dried blood spots (DBS), a method for self-collected blood sampling for serological screening of HIV, hepatitis B (HBV) and syphilis. The aims of this study were to assess the acceptability and feasibility of self-collected DBS and to compare the test results for screening of HIV, HBV and syphilis from DBS with blood drawn by venous puncture. Methods DBS were collected from men who have sex with men (MSM), visiting the STI clinic of the public health service South Limburg (n = 183) and HIV positive and HBV positive patients (n = 34), visiting the outpatient clinics of the Maastricht University Medical Centre in the period January 2012–April 2015. The 93 first participating MSM visiting the STI clinic were asked to fill in a questionnaire about the feasibility and acceptability about self-collection of DBS in a setting without going to a health care facility and were asked to collect the DBS themselves. Serological screening tests for HIV (HIV combi PT, Roche), HBV (HBsAg, Roche) and syphilis (Treponema pallidum Ig, Biokit 3.0) were performed on DBS and on blood drawn by venous puncture, which was routinely taken for screening. Results In total 217 participants were included in the study with a median age of 40 years (range between 17–80). Of MSM 84% agreed that it was clear and easy to do the finger-prick, while 53% agreed that it was clear and easy to apply the blood onto the DBS card. Also, 80% of MSM would use the bloodspot test again. In 91% (198) of DBS, sufficient material was collected to perform the three tests. No difference was observed in DBS quality between self-collected DBS and health care worker collected DBS. For HIV (n = 195 DBS-serum pairs) sensitivity and specificity were 100%. For HBV the sensitivity for HBsAg (n = 202) was 90% and specificity was 99%. For syphilis (n = 191) the sensitivity of the DBS was 93% with a specificity of 99%. Analysis of the DBS of HIV positive participants (n = 38) did show similar test performance for HBV and syphilis as in HIV negatives. Conclusion DBS is an acceptable self-sampling method for MSM, as there was no difference in DBS quality in self-collected and health care worker collected DBS. Test performance, i.e., its high sensitivity (>90%) and specificity (>99%) measures show that DBS is a valid alternative for venous blood puncture. Especially when DBS is combined with home-collected sampling for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, complete STI screening can be done in outreach setting and/or home-collected sampling in MSM."

Present investigation pursues to identify the effect of T164I variation on function and structure of β2AR through systematic computational approaches. The study, in addition, addresses altered binding of salbutamol in T164I variant through molecular dynamic simulations. Methods involving changes in free energy, solvent accessibility surface area, root mean square deviations and analysis of binding cavity revealed structural perturbations in receptor to incur upon T164I substitution. For comprehensive understanding of receptor upon substitution, OPLS force field aided molecular dynamic simulations were performed for 10 ns. Simulations revealed massive structural departure for T164I β2AR variant from the native state along with considerably higher root mean square fluctuations of residues near the cavity. Affinity prediction by molecular docking showed two folds reduced affinity of salbutamol in T164I variant. To validate the credibility docking results, simulations for ligand-receptor complex were performed which demonstrated unstable salbutamol-T164I β2AR complex formation. Further, analysis of interactions in course of simulations revealed reduced ligand-receptor interactions of salbutamol in T164I variant. Taken together, studies herein provide structural rationales for suboptimal binding of salbutamol in T164I variant through integrated molecular modeling approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2766603153,"Pyridoxine dependent epilepsy (PDE) is caused by likely pathogenic variants in ALDH7A1 (PDE-ALDH7A1) and inherited autosomal recessively. Neurotoxic alpha-amino adipic semialdehyde (alpha-AASA), piperideine 6-carboxylate and pipecolic acid accumulate in body fluids. Neonatal or infantile onset seizures refractory to anti-epileptic medications are clinical features. Treatment with pyridoxine, arginine and lysine-restricted diet does not normalize neurodevelopmental outcome or accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites. There is no animal model for high throughput drug screening. For this reason, we developed and characterized the first knock-out aldh7a1 zebrafish model using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Zebrafish aldh7a1 mutants were generated by using a vector free method of CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis. Genotype analysis of aldh7a1 knock-out zebrafish was performed by high resolution melt analysis, direct sequencing and QIAxcel system. Electroencephalogram was performed. Alpha-AASA, piperideine 6-carboxylate and pipecolic acid, were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Our knock-out aldh7a1 zebrafish has homozygous 5 base pair (bp) mutation in ALDH7A1. Knock-out aldh7a1 embryos have spontaneous rapid increase in locomotion and a rapid circling swim behavior earliest 8-day post fertilization (dpf). Electroencephalogram revealed large amplitude spike discharges compared to wild type. Knock-out aldh7a1 embryos have elevated alpha-AASA, piperideine 6-carboxylate and pipecolic acid compared to wild type embryos at 3 dpf. Knock-out aldh7a1 embryos showed no aldh7a1 protein by western blot compared to wild type. Our knock-out aldh7a1 zebrafish is a well characterized model for large-scale drug screening using behavioral and biochemical features and accurately recapitulates the human PDE-ALDH7A1 disease."

https://openalex.org/W2766668597,"Tropical wetlands are thought to be the most important source of interannual variability in atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations, yet sparse data prevents them from being incorporated into Earth system models. This problem is particularly pronounced in the neotropics where bottom-up models based on water table depth are incongruent with top-down inversion models suggesting unaccounted sinks or sources of CH4. The newly documented vast areas of peatlands in the Amazon basin may account for an important unrecognized CH4 source, but the hydrologic and biogeochemical controls of CH4 dynamics from these systems remain poorly understood. We studied three zones of a peatland in Madre de Dios, Peru, to test whether CH4 emissions and pore water concentrations varied with vegetation community, soil chemistry and proximity to groundwater sources. We found that the open-canopy herbaceous zone emitted roughly one-third as much CH4 as the Mauritia flexuosa palm-dominated areas (4.7 ± 0.9 and 14.0 ± 2.4 mg CH4 m-2 h-1, respectively). Emissions decreased with distance from groundwater discharge across the three sampling sites, and tracked changes in soil carbon chemistry, especially increased soil phenolics. Based on all available data, we calculate that neotropical peatlands contribute emissions of 43 ± 11.9 Tg CH4 y-1, however this estimate is subject to geographic bias and will need revision once additional studies are published."
https://openalex.org/W2766983143,"Highly structured RNA derived from viral genomes is a key cellular indicator of viral infection. In response, cells produce the interferon inducible RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) that, when bound to viral dsRNA, phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2α and attenuates viral protein translation. Adenovirus can evade this line of defence through transcription of a non-coding RNA, VAI, an inhibitor of PKR. VAI consists of three base-paired regions that meet at a three-way junction; an apical stem responsible for the interaction with PKR, a central stem required for inhibition, and a terminal stem. Recent studies have highlighted the potential importance of the tertiary structure of the three-way junction to PKR inhibition by enabling interaction between regions of the central and terminal stems. To further investigate the role of the three-way junction, we characterized the binding affinity and inhibitory potential of central stem mutants designed to introduce subtle alterations. These results were then correlated with small-angle X-ray scattering solution studies and computational tertiary structural models. Our results demonstrate that while mutations to the central stem have no observable effect on binding affinity to PKR, mutations that appear to disrupt the structure of the three-way junction prevent inhibition of PKR. Therefore, we propose that instead of simply sequestering PKR, a specific structural conformation of the PKR-VAI complex may be required for inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2765312353,"Background Mortality rates in females who survived acute myocardial infarction (AMI) exceed those in males. Differences between sexes in age, cardiovascular risk factors and revascularization therapy have been proposed as possible reasons. Objective To select sets of female and male patients comparable in respect of relevant risk factors in order to compare the sex-specific risk in a systematic manner. Methods Data of the ISAR-RISK and ART studies were investigated. Patients were enrolled between 1996 and 2005 and suffered from AMI within 4 weeks prior to enrolment. Patients of each sex were selected with 1:1 equivalent age, previous AMI history, sinus-rhythm presence, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and revascularization therapy. Survival times were compared between sex groups in the whole study cohort and in the matched cohort. Results Of 3840 consecutive AMI survivors, 994 (25.9%) were females and 2846 (74.1%) were males. Females were older and suffered more frequently from hypertension and diabetes mellitus. In the whole cohort, females showed an increased mortality with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.54 compared to males (p<0.0001). The matched cohort comprised 802 patients of each sex and revealed a trend towards poorer survival in females (HR for female sex 1.14; p = 0.359). However, significant mortality differences with a higher risk in matched females was observed during the first year after AMI (HR = 1.61; p = 0.045) but not during the subsequent years. Conclusion Matched sub-groups of post-AMI patients showed a comparable long-term mortality. However, a female excess mortality remained during first year after AMI and cannot be explained by differences in age, cardiovascular risk factors, and modes of acute treatment. Other causal factors, including clinical as well as psychological and social aspects, need to be considered. Female post-AMI patients should be followed more actively particularly during the first year after AMI."
https://openalex.org/W2766163840,"Gene flow dynamics of common ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) is affected by several human activities in Central Europe, including habitat fragmentation, agroforestry expansion, controlled and uncontrolled transfer of reproductive material, and a recently introduced emerging infectious disease, ash dieback, caused by Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. Habitat fragmentation may alter genetic connectivity and effective population size, leading to loss of genetic diversity and increased inbreeding in ash populations. Gene flow from cultivated trees in landscapes close to their native counterparts may also influence the adaptability of future generations. The devastating effects of ash dieback have already been observed in both natural and managed populations in continental Europe. However, potential long-term effects of genetic bottlenecks depend on gene flow across fragmented landscapes. For this reason, we studied the genetic connectivity of ash trees in an isolated forest patch of a fragmented landscape in Rösenbeck, Germany. We applied two approaches to parentage analysis to estimate gene flow patterns at the study site. We specifically investigated the presence of background pollination at the landscape level and the degree of genetic isolation between native and cultivated trees. Local meteorological data was utilized to understand the effect of wind on the pollen and seed dispersal patterns. Gender information of the adult trees was considered for calculating the dispersal distances. We found that the majority of the studied seeds (55–64%) and seedlings (75–98%) in the forest patch were fathered and mothered by the trees within the same patch. However, we determined a considerable amount of pollen flow (26–45%) from outside of the study site, representing background pollination at the landscape level. Limited pollen flow was observed from neighbouring cultivated trees (2%). Both pollen and seeds were dispersed in all directions in accordance with the local wind directions. Whereas there was no positive correlation between pollen dispersal distance and wind speed, the correlation between seed dispersal distance and wind speed was significant (0.71, p < 0.001), indicating that strong wind favours long-distance dispersal of ash seeds. Finally, we discussed the implications of establishing gene conservation stands and the use of enrichment planting in the face of ash dieback."
https://openalex.org/W2765303170,"Pituitary gonadotropin hormones are regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) via MAPK signaling pathways that stimulate gene transcription of the common α-subunit (Cga) and the hormone-specific β-subunits of gonadotropin. We have reported previously that GnRH-induced activities at these genes include various histone modifications, but we did not examine histone phosphorylation. This modification adds a negative charge to residues of the histone tails that interact with the negatively charged DNA, is associated with closed chromatin during mitosis, but is increased at certain genes for transcriptional activation. Thus, the functions of this modification are unclear. We initially hypothesized that GnRH might induce phosphorylation of Ser-10 in histone 3 (H3S10p) as part of its regulation of gonadotropin gene expression, possibly involving cross-talk with H3K9 acetylation. We found that GnRH increases the levels of both modifications around the Cga gene transcriptional start site and that JNK inhibition dramatically reduces H3S10p levels. However, this modification had only a minor effect on Cga expression and no effect on H3K9ac. GnRH also increased H3S28p and H3K27ac levels and also those of activated mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1). MSK1 inhibition dramatically reduced H3S28p levels in untreated and GnRH-treated cells and also affected H3K27ac levels. Although not affecting basal Cga expression, MSK1/2 inhibition repressed GnRH activation of Cga expression. Moreover, ChIP analysis revealed that GnRH-activated MSK1 targets the first nucleosome just downstream from the TSS. Given that the elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) stalls at this well positioned nucleosome, GnRH-induced H3S28p, possibly in association with H3K27ac, would facilitate the progression of RNAPII."
https://openalex.org/W2765658292,"The transcription factor NR4A1 has emerged as a pivotal regulator of the inflammatory response and immune homeostasis. Although contribution of NR4A1 in the innate immune response has been demonstrated, its role in host defense against viral infection remains to be investigated. In the present study, we show that administration of cytosporone B (Csn-B), a specific agonist of NR4A1, to mice infected with influenza virus (IAV) reduces lung viral loads and improves pulmonary function. Our results demonstrate that administration of Csn-B to naive mice leads to a modest production of type 1 IFN. However, in IAV-infected mice, such production of IFNs is markedly increased following treatment with Csn-B. Our study also reveals that alveolar macrophages (AMs) appear to have a significant role in Csn-B effects, since selective depletion of AMs with clodronate liposome correlates with a marked reduction of IFN production, viral clearance and morbidity in IAV-infected mice. Furthermore, when reemergence of AMs is observed following clodronate liposome administration, an increased production of IFNs was detected in bronchoalveolar fluids of IAV-infected mice treated with Csn-B, supporting the contribution of AMs in Csn-B effects. While treatment of mice with Csn-B induces phosphorylation of transcriptional factors IRF3 and IRF7, the latter appears to be less indispensable since effects of Csn-B treatment on the synthesis of IFNs were slightly affected in IAV-infected mice lacking functional IRF7. Together, our results highlight the capacity of Csn-B and consequently of NR4A1 transcription factor in controlling IAV infection."

If so, to provide such norms based on the evidence currently available. Methods A comparison of published data from four sources was analyzed. Data from the two physician samples were then entered into a meta-analysis to obtain full information estimates and generate provisional norms for physicians. Results Two-way analysis of variance (Study x Index) revealed a significant main effect and an interaction. Results indicate differences in mean levels of performance and standard deviation for physicians.

https://openalex.org/W2766849042,"Gibberellin wastewater cannot be directly discharged without treatment due to its high concentrations of sulfate and organic compounds and strong acidity. Therefore, multi-stage anaerobic bioreactor + micro-aerobic+ anoxic/aeration (A/O) + biological contact oxidation combined processes are used to treat gibberellin wastewater. However, knowledge of the treatment effects of the A/O process and bacterial community structure in the aeration tank reactors of such systems is sparse. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the treatment effects and operation of the A/O process on gibberellin wastewater, as well as changes in the bacterial community structure of activated sludge in the aeration tank during treatment. Moreover, removal was examined based on evaluation of effluent after A/O treatment. Although influent chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH3-N and total phosphorus (TP) fluctuated, effluent COD, NH3-N and TP remained stable. Moreover, average COD, NH3-N and TP removal efficiency were 68.41%, 93.67% and 45.82%, respectively, during the A/O process. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all samples, followed by Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Proteobacteria played an important role in the removal of organic matter. Chloroflexi was found to be responsible for the degradation of carbohydrates and Bacteroidetes also had been found to be responsible for the degradation of complex organic matters. Actinobacteria are able to degrade a variety of environmental chemicals. Additionally, Anaerolineaceae_uncultured was the major genus in samples collected on May 25, 2015, while Novosphingobium and Nitrospira were dominant in most samples. Nitrosomonas are regarded as the dominant ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, while Nitrospira are the main nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. Bacterial community structure varied considerably with time, and a partial Mantel test showed a highly significant positive correlation between bacterial community structure and DO. The bacterial community structure was also positively correlated with temperature and SO42-."

https://openalex.org/W2765398665,"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterised by a constellation of symptoms diagnosed with a number of different polythetic criteria. Heterogeneity across these diagnostic criteria is likely to be confounding research into the as-yet-unknown pathophysiology underlying this stigmatised and debilitating condition and may diagnose a disease spectrum with significant implications for clinical management. No studies to date have objectively investigated this possibility using a validated measure of CFS symptoms-the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ).To examine whether current CFS diagnostic criteria are identifying different disease phenotypes using the DSQ.Case control study.Clinical Research Facility of the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.49 CFS subjects and ten matched, sedentary community controls, excluded for co-morbid depression.Self-reported autonomic and cognitive features were assessed with the Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS) and Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (COGFAIL) respectively. Objective autonomic cardiovascular parameters were examined using the Task Force® Monitor and a battery of neuropsychological tests administered for objective cognitive assessment.Self-reported autonomic and cognitive symptoms were significantly greater in CFS subjects compared to controls. There were no statistically significant differences in objective autonomic measures between CFS and controls. There were clinically significant differences between DSQ subgroups on objective autonomic testing. Visuospatial memory, verbal memory and psychomotor speed were significantly different between DSQ subgroups.The finding of no significant differences in objective autonomic testing between CFS and control subjects may reflect the inclusion of sedentary controls or exclusion for co-morbid depression. Consistent exclusion criteria would enable better delineation of these two conditions and their presenting symptoms. Findings across CFS subgroups suggest subjects have a different disease burden on subjective and objective measures of function, autonomic parameters and cognitive impairment when categorised using the DSQ. Different CFS criteria may at best be diagnosing a spectrum of disease severities and at worst different CFS phenotypes or even different diseases. This complicates research and disease management and may contribute to the significant stigma associated with the condition."
https://openalex.org/W2766487296,"Objectives Odontogenic tumors (OT) represent a specific pathological category that includes some lesions with unpredictable biological behavior. Although most of these lesions are benign, some, such as the ameloblastoma, exhibit local aggressiveness and high recurrence rates. The most common types of ameloblastoma are the solid/multicystic (SA) and the unicystic ameloblastoma (UA); the latter considered a much less aggressive entity as compared to the SA. The microRNA system regulates the expression of many human genes while its deregulation has been associated with neoplastic development. The aim of the current study was to determine the expression profiles of microRNAs present in the two most common types of ameloblastomas. Material & methods MicroRNA expression profiles were assessed using TaqMan® Low Density Arrays (TLDAs) in 24 samples (8 SA, 8 UA and 8 control samples). The findings were validated using quantitative RTqPCR in an independent cohort of 19 SA, 8 UA and 19 dentigerous cysts as controls. Results We identified 40 microRNAs differentially regulated in ameloblastomas, which are related to neoplastic development and differentiation, and with the osteogenic process. Further validation of the top ranked microRNAs revealed significant differences in the expression of 6 of them in relation to UA, 7 in relation to SA and 1 (miR-489) that was related to both types. Conclusion We identified a new microRNA signature for the ameloblastoma and for its main types, which may be useful to better understand the etiopathogenesis of this neoplasm. In addition, we identified a microRNA (miR-489) that is suggestive of differentiating among solid from unicystic ameloblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2767147063,"Microtubules in animal cells assemble (nucleate) from both the centrosome and the cis-Golgi cisternae. A-kinase anchor protein 350 kDa (AKAP350A, also called AKAP450/CG-NAP/AKAP9) is a large scaffolding protein located at both the centrosome and Golgi apparatus. Previous findings have suggested that AKAP350 is important for microtubule dynamics at both locations, but how this scaffolding protein assembles microtubule nucleation machinery is unclear. Here, we found that overexpression of the C-terminal third of AKAP350A, enhanced GFP-AKAP350A(2691–3907), induces the formation of multiple microtubule-nucleation centers (MTNCs). Nevertheless, these induced MTNCs lacked “true” centriole proteins, such as Cep135. Mapping analysis with AKAP350A truncations demonstrated that AKAP350A contains discrete regions responsible for promoting or inhibiting the formation of multiple MTNCs. Moreover, GFP-AKAP350A(2691–3907) recruited several pericentriolar proteins to MTNCs, including γ-tubulin, pericentrin, Cep68, Cep170, and Cdk5RAP2. Proteomic analysis indicated that Cdk5RAP2 and Cep170 both interact with the microtubule nucleation-promoting region of AKAP350A, whereas Cep68 interacts with the distal C-terminal AKAP350A region. Yeast two-hybrid assays established a direct interaction of Cep170 with AKAP350A. Super-resolution and deconvolution microscopy analyses were performed to define the association of AKAP350A with centrosomes, and these studies disclosed that AKAP350A spans the bridge between centrioles, co-localizing with rootletin and Cep68 in the linker region. siRNA-mediated depletion of AKAP350A caused displacement of both Cep68 and Cep170 from the centrosome. These results suggest that AKAP350A acts as a scaffold for factors involved in microtubule nucleation at the centrosome and coordinates the assembly of protein complexes associating with the intercentriolar bridge."
https://openalex.org/W2765275928,"Background There is widespread evidence that statistical methods play an important role in original research articles, especially in medical research. The evaluation of statistical methods and reporting in journals suffers from a lack of standardized methods for assessing the use of statistics. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate an instrument to assess the statistical intensity in research articles in a standardized way. Methods A checklist-type measure scale was developed by selecting and refining items from previous reports about the statistical contents of medical journal articles and from published guidelines for statistical reporting. A total of 840 original medical research articles that were published between 2007–2015 in 16 journals were evaluated to test the scoring instrument. The total sum of all items was used to assess the intensity between sub-fields and journals. Inter-rater agreement was examined using a random sample of 40 articles. Four raters read and evaluated the selected articles using the developed instrument. Results The scale consisted of 66 items. The total summary score adequately discriminated between research articles according to their study design characteristics. The new instrument could also discriminate between journals according to their statistical intensity. The inter-observer agreement measured by the ICC was 0.88 between all four raters. Individual item analysis showed very high agreement between the rater pairs, the percentage agreement ranged from 91.7% to 95.2%. Conclusions A reliable and applicable instrument for evaluating the statistical intensity in research papers was developed. It is a helpful tool for comparing the statistical intensity between sub-fields and journals. The novel instrument may be applied in manuscript peer review to identify papers in need of additional statistical review."
https://openalex.org/W2766350244,"Calpains are a family of intracellular proteases defined by a conserved protease domain. In the marine mollusk Aplysia californica, calpains are important for the induction of long-term synaptic plasticity and memory, at least in part by cleaving protein kinase Cs (PKCs) into constitutively active kinases, termed protein kinase Ms (PKMs). We identify 14 genes encoding calpains in Aplysia using bioinformatics, including at least one member of each of the four major calpain families into which metazoan calpains are generally classified, as well as additional truncated and atypical calpains. Six classical calpains containing a penta-EF-hand (PEF) domain are present in Aplysia. Phylogenetic analysis determined that these six calpains come from three separate classical calpain families. One of the classical calpains in Aplysia, AplCCal1, has been implicated in plasticity. We identify three splice cassettes and an alternative transcriptional start site in AplCCal1. We characterize several of the possible isoforms of AplCCal1 in vitro, and demonstrate that AplCCal1 can cleave PKCs into PKMs in a calcium-dependent manner in vitro. We also find that AplCCal1 has a novel mechanism of auto-inactivation through N-terminal cleavage that is modulated through its alternative transcriptional start site."

The aim of this study was to determine the genetic diversity and population differentiation within Urophysa and investigate the effect of the Yungui Plateau uplift and climate oscillations on evolution of Urophysa. In this study, micro-morphological characteristics, nine microsatellite loci (SSR), two nuclear loci (ITS and ETS) and two chloroplast fragments (psbA-trnH and trnL-trnF) were used to analyze the phylogenetic relationships and assess genetic and phylogeographical structure of Urophysa. Isolation by distance (IBD) was performed to research the effects of geographical isolation. We detected high genetic diversity at the species level but low genetic diversity within populations. Striking genetic differentiation (AMOVA) among populations and a significant phylogeographical structure (NST > GST, p < 0.01) were detected among U. henryi populations, along with significant effects of isolation by distance (IBD). Molecular clock estimation using calibration strategy and cpDNA substitution rate indicated that the divergence of U. henryi occurred during late Miocene to early Quaternary, when the orogeny of Yungui Plateau was violent. U. rockii originated at the early Quaternary and further differentiated at early Pleistocene. Our results suggested that habitat fragmentation played an important role in the genetic diversity and population differentiation of U. rockii and U. henryi. Heterogenous geomorphological configuration and complicated environment resulted from rapid uplift of the Yungui Plateau were inferred as important incentives for the modern phylogeograhpical pattern and species divergence of Urophysa. The geographical isolation, limited gene flow, specialized morphologies and the Pleistocene climatic oscillation greatly contributed to the allopatric divergence of U. rockii. Significant genetic drift and inbreeding were detected in these two species, in situ measures should be implemented to protect them."
https://openalex.org/W2765346298,"α-Synuclein (α-syn) is associated with a range of diseases, including Parkinson disease. In disease, α-syn is known to aggregate and has the potential to be neurotoxic. The association between copper and α-syn results in the formation of stellate toxic oligomers that are highly toxic to cultured neurons. We further investigated the mechanism of toxicity of α-syn oligomers. Cells that overexpress α-syn showed increased susceptibility to the toxicity of the oligomers, while those that overexpressed β-syn showed increased resistance to the toxic oligomers. Elevated α-syn expression caused an increase in expression of the transcription factor Forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a). Inhibition of FoxO3a activity by the overexpression of DNA binding domain of FoxO3a resulted in significant protection from α-syn oligomer toxicity. Increased FoxO3a expression in cells was shown to be caused by increased ferrireductase activity and Fe(II) levels. These results suggest that α-syn increases FoxO3a expression as a result of its intrinsic ferrireductase activity. The results also suggest that FoxO3a plays a pivotal role in the toxicity of both Fe(II) and toxic α-syn species to neuronal cells.—Angelova, D. M., Jones, H. B. L., Brown, D. R.

https://openalex.org/W2765525173,"Ras proteins regulate cell survival, growth, differentiation, blood pressure, and fibrosis in some organs. We have demonstrated that H-ras gene deletion produces mice hypotension via a soluble guanylate cyclase-protein kinase G (PKG)–dependent mechanism. In this study, we analyzed the consequences of H-ras deletion on cardiac remodeling induced by continuous angiotensin II (AngII) infusion and the molecular mechanisms implied. Left ventricular posterior wall thickness and mass and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area were similar between AngII-treated H-Ras knockout (H-ras−/−) and control wild-type (H-ras+/+) mice, as were extracellular matrix protein expression. Increased cardiac PKG-Iβ protein expression in H-ras−/− mice suggests the involvement of this protein in heart protection. Ex vivo experiments on cardiac explants could support this mechanism, as PKG blockade blunted protection against AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis markers in H-ras−/− mice. Genetic modulation studies in cardiomyocytes and cardiac and embryonic fibroblasts revealed that the lack of H-Ras down-regulates the B-RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, which induces the glycogen synthase kinase-3β-dependent activation of the transcription factor, cAMP response element-binding protein, which is responsible for PKG-Iβ overexpression in H-ras−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts. This study demonstrates that H-ras deletion protects against AngII-induced cardiac remodeling, possibly via a mechanism in which PKG-Iβ overexpression could play a partial role, and points to H-Ras and/or downstream proteins as potential therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease.—Martín-Sánchez, P., Luengo, A., Griera, M., Orea, M.

https://openalex.org/W2766182032,"Design, build, test, repeat—the essence of design thinking and a guiding principle of synthetic biology. Given the complexities of biological systems, there are bottlenecks that slow this virtuous design cycle for many of its potential applications. Yet, in the realm of small protein design and testing, the floodgates have just been thrust open. The recent study by David Baker’s group creates a platform for the design, testing, and refinement of small therapeutic proteins (Chevalier et al., 2017Chevalier A. Silva D.A. Rocklin G.J. Hicks D.R. Vergara R. Murapa P. Bernard S.M. Zhang L. Lam K.H. Yao G. et al.Nature. 2017; 550: 74-79PubMed Google Scholar) and uses this to create de novo designed protein inhibitors of influenza and botulinum toxin. The key element to their work is that it is “massively parallel” in most of its facets. In the initial stage, they design and screen hundreds of thousands of peptides computationally for likelihood of high-affinity binding to a target using Rosetta, a program developed in the Baker lab that predicts protein structure (https://www.rosettacommons.org/). Although protein structures have long been used to computationally aid in the design of small molecules, chemical space is fantastically vast, and our ability to build and test in that space is constrained by the limits of chemical synthesis or the availability of compounds in existing libraries. These limits are much less pronounced in protein space and the effort by Chevalier et al. illustrates that making and testing designed proteins should be far easier to scale. The authors point to the convergence of two technical advances that enable this massively parallel pipeline. First is the ability to accurately model the structure of small proteins in the size range of 40 amino acids, and second, the capacity to synthesize oligonucleotides large enough to encode them. After computationally identifying approximately 10,000 peptides with high-predicted binding and stability for the two targets, they are able to directly make the oligonucleotides encoding them. These are then assembled in yeast libraries from which cells expressing potential binders are sorted and the proteins identified using deep sequencing. This pipeline ultimately results in the identification of thousands of high-affinity binders. Further analysis of which predicted binders do bind and which don’t is used to refine the computational model, thus completing the design cycle. These landmark efforts build off the group’s long-term goal of figuring out how sequence impacts folding and stability and their use of iterative cycles to improve computational-based design (e.g., Rocklin et al., 2017Rocklin G.J. Chidyausiku T.M. Goreshnik I. Ford A. Houliston S. Lemak A. Carter L. Ravichandran R. Mulligan V.K. Chevalier A. et al.Science. 2017; 357: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To cap off their latest study, the authors choose individual peptides for additional proof-of-principle testing, including confirmatory crystal structures and evidence of in vitro and in vivo activity. Specifically, the influenza inhibitor is shown to have impressive efficacy in mouse models of infection, and the toxin inhibitor protects cultured rat cortical neurons. It is also very important to note that repeated administration of the influenza-targeting small proteins does not elicit a strong immune response. This portends well for de novo designed small proteins as potential therapeutics, although further work is needed to fully explore their immunogenicity and determine whether additional steps in the design stages will be needed to filter out peptides with high immunogenic potential. It is also an open question whether computational analysis can be used to filter out small proteins that have greater potential for off-target effects. Time to take out the crystal ball. What could this mean for a future bench researcher, who for example, might want to make a new inhibitor for a target protein? The starting point for such a project might one day be as simple as pulling up the structure, running a computer program, and ordering a few thousand oligonucleotides—perhaps an afternoon’s work. What could a shift to massively parallel peptide design mean for the larger scientific community? The number of clinical trials based on small peptide therapeutics has been increasing in recent years. This should only accelerate given the speed and ease of protein synthesis methods coupled with these new computational tools. Perhaps in a decade, the majority of new filings for clinical trials will be for small designer proteins and not small molecules or antibodies."

Here, we present a systematic analysis of body scanning data of 2,700 urban children and adolescents in the age range between 5 and 18 years with the special aim to stratify the participants into distinct body shape types and to describe their change upon development. In a first step, we extracted a set of eight representative meta-measures from the data. Each of them collects a related group of anthropometrical features and changes specifically upon aging. In a second step we defined seven body types by clustering the meta-measures of all participants. These body types describe the body shapes in terms of three weight (lower, normal and overweight) and three age (young, medium and older) categories. For younger children (age of 5–10 years) we found a common ‘early childhood body shape’ which splits into three weight-dependent types for older children, with one or two years delay for boys. Our study shows that the concept of body types provides a reliable option for the anthropometric characterization of developing and aging populations."

However, advances in molecular research are hindered by the lack of a high-throughput transient transformation system in this non-model plant. In this study, a proof-of-concept is demonstrated by the successful application of Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated plant transformation to produce composite avocado plants. Two ex vitro strategies were assessed on two avocado genotypes (Itzamna and A0.74): In the first approach, 8-week-old etiolated seedlings were scarred with a sterile hacksaw blade at the base of the shoot, and in the second, inch-long incisions were made at the base of the shoot (20-week-old non-etiolated plants) with a sterile blade to remove the cortical tissue. The scarred/wounded shoot surfaces were treated with A. rhizogenes strains (K599 or ARqua1) transformed with or without binary plant transformation vectors pRedRootII (DsRed1 marker), pBYR2e1-GFP (GFP- green fluorescence protein marker) or pBINUbiGUSint (GUS- beta-glucuronidase marker) with and without rooting hormone (Dip 'N' Grow) application. The treated shoot regions were air-layered with sterile moist cocopeat to induce root formation. Results showed that hormone application significantly increased root induction, while Agrobacterium-only treatments resulted in very few roots. Combination treatments of hormone+Agrobacterium (-/+ plasmids) showed no significant difference. Only the ARqua1(+plasmid):A0.74 combination resulted in root transformants, with hormone+ARqua1(+pBINUbiGUSint) being the most effective treatment with ~17 and 25% composite plants resulting from strategy-1 and strategy-2, respectively. GUS- and GFP-expressing roots accounted for less than 4 and ~11%, respectively, of the total roots/treatment/avocado genotype. The average number of transgenic roots on the composite plants was less than one per plant in all treatments. PCR and Southern analysis further confirmed the transgenic nature of the roots expressing the screenable marker genes. Transgenic roots showed hyper-branching compared to the wild-type roots but this had no impact on Phytophthora cinnamomi infection. There was no difference in pathogen load 7-days-post inoculation between transformed and control roots. Strategy-2 involving A0.74:ARqua1 combination was the best ex vitro approach in producing composite avocado plants. The approach followed in this proof-of-concept study needs further optimisation involving multiple avocado genotypes and A. rhizogenes strains to achieve enhanced root transformation efficiencies, which would then serve as an effective high-throughput tool in the functional screening of host and pathogen genes to improve our understanding of the avocado-P. cinnamomi interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2735433028,"Across scientific disciplines, thresholded pairwise measures of statistical dependence between time series are taken as proxies for the interactions between the dynamical units of a network. Yet such correlation measures often fail to reflect the underlying physical interactions accurately. Here we systematically study the problem of reconstructing direct physical interaction networks from thresholding correlations. We explicate how local common cause and relay structures, heterogeneous in-degrees and non-local structural properties of the network generally hinder reconstructibility. However, in the limit of weak coupling strengths we prove that stationary systems with dynamics close to a given operating point transition to universal reconstructiblity across all network topologies."
https://openalex.org/W2766388647,"We explored the utility of neural stem cells (NSCs) as an in vitro model for evaluating preclinical therapeutics in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase-deficient (SSADHD) mice. NSCs were obtained from aldh5a1+/+ and aldh5a1-/- mice (aldh5a1 = aldehyde dehydrogenase 5a1 = SSADH). Multiple parameters were evaluated including: (1) production of GHB (γ-hydroxybutyrate), the biochemical hallmark of SSADHD; (2) rescue from cell death with the dual mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitor, XL-765, an agent previously shown to rescue aldh5a1-/- mice from premature lethality; (3) mitochondrial number, total reactive oxygen species, and mitochondrial superoxide production, all previously documented as abnormal in aldh5a1-/- mice; (4) total ATP levels and ATP consumption; and (5) selected gene expression profiles associated with epilepsy, a prominent feature in both experimental and human SSADHD. Patterns of dysfunction were observed in all of these parameters and mirrored earlier findings in aldh5a1-/- mice. Patterns of dysregulated gene expression between hypothalamus and NSCs centered on ion channels, GABAergic receptors, and inflammation, suggesting novel pathomechanisms as well as a developmental ontogeny for gene expression potentially associated with the murine epileptic phenotype. The NSC model of SSADHD will be valuable in providing a first-tier screen for centrally-acting therapeutics and prioritizing therapeutic concepts of preclinical animal studies applicable to SSADHD."
https://openalex.org/W2765860842,"The polled phenotype of cattle is increasingly becoming favourable mainly because of the enhanced emphasis on animal welfare, for which the causative mutations have been reported during the past years. The Shuxuan cattle are a new synthetic breed by crossing the indigenous cattle with both Simmental and Holstein semen in Sichuan of Southwest China, in which about 15% of polled individuals have newly emerged. Because official record about POLLED genotypes for the historically imported sires is unavailable, we therefore genotyped the proposed POLLED variants of P202ID, P80kbID and P219ID among 48 polled and 16 horned Shuxuan cattle. It was first revealed that all three candidate mutations have been simultaneously introgressed into Shuxuan cattle, whereas the P202ID mutation is dominant. Furthermore, one polled animal still remains to carry none of the three candidate mutations, which suggests that further mutation(s) would also exist. Additionally, we sequenced mitochondrial DNA and found that Shuxuan cattle are composed of two matrilineal origins of Bos taurus (65.6%) and B. indicus (34.4%); and there is no origin-biased distribution of polled phenotype. In conclusion, our study first supports the recently reported novel candidate mutation of P219ID and detects simultaneous presences of all three known POLLED mutations within a cattle breed."
https://openalex.org/W2765534772,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a lipid and protein phosphatase that antagonizes signaling by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway. The PTEN gene is a major tumor suppressor, with mutations of this gene occurring frequently in tumors of humans and mice. We have now developed mutant medaka deficient in PTEN with the use of transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology. Medaka possesses two pten genes, ptena and ptenb, similar to zebrafish. We established 16 ptena mutant lines and two ptenb mutant lines. Homozygous single pten mutants were found to be viable and fertile. In contrast, pten double-knockout (dko) embryos manifested severe abnormalities in vasculogenesis, eye size, and tail development at 72 hours post fertilization(hpf) and died before hatching. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the ratio of phosphorylated to total forms of AKT (pAKT/AKT) in pten dko embryos was four times that in wild-type embryos, indicative of up-regulation of signaling by the PI3K-AKT pathway. Treatment of pten dko embryos with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduced the pAKT/AKT ratio by about one-half and partially rescued the defect in vasculogenesis. Additional inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT pathway, including rapamycin and N-α-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, also partially restored vasculogenesis in the dko embryos. Our model system thus allows pten dko embryos to be readily distinguished from wild-type embryos at an early stage of development and is suitable for the screening of drugs able to compensate for PTEN deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2765782740,"Background Thalidomide is known to have induced thalidomide embryopathy (TE) in more than 10,000 live-born children worldwide between 1957–1962. Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the need for orthopaedic surgery and limb orthosis in relation to function and physical independence in middle-aged individuals with TE. Methods 13 women/18 men with a mean age of 45.8 (SD 1.1) years were included. Information about limb surgery, the use of orthotic devices, jobs, accommodation, disability adjustments and personal assistants was collected. Physical function was measured by a modified general function score. The time needed for activities of daily living (ADL) was collected. Individuals with proximal focal femoral deficiency, PFFD, and participants in need of home or work adaptations were compared with the rest of the group. Result 31 surgical procedures had been performed in the extremities. Three individuals were in need of personal assistance and seven had disability-adjusted homes. 28 individuals were working and 24 reported participation in exercises. Those with PFFD had significantly lower function score and needed a significantly longer time for ADL in the morning (p = 0.001 and p = 0.032). The group in need of home or work adjustments had significantly lower function score and needed longer time for morning ADL (p = 0.012 and p = 0.009). Discussion Few orthopaedic procedures had been performed. The TE individuals except the ones with PFFD and those in the need of disability adjustments, were mostly active workers, reported good physical function and participated in exercises, despite limb malformations."
