https://openalex.org/W2513105811,"Accumulation of fumarate resulting from mutations in fumarate hydratase,which are associated with renal and other cancers, is shown to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition—a process associated with cancer initiation. Mutations of the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase cause hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer1. Fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cancers are highly aggressive and metastasize even when small, leading to a very poor clinical outcome2. Fumarate, a small molecule metabolite that accumulates in fumarate hydratase-deficient cells, plays a key role in cell transformation, making it a bona fide oncometabolite3. Fumarate has been shown to inhibit α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that are involved in DNA and histone demethylation4,5. However, the link between fumarate accumulation, epigenetic changes, and tumorigenesis is unclear. Here we show that loss of fumarate hydratase and the subsequent accumulation of fumarate in mouse and human cells elicits an epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), a phenotypic switch associated with cancer initiation, invasion, and metastasis6. We demonstrate that fumarate inhibits Tet-mediated demethylation of a regulatory region of the antimetastatic miRNA cluster6 mir-200ba429, leading to the expression of EMT-related transcription factors and enhanced migratory properties. These epigenetic and phenotypic changes are recapitulated by the incubation of fumarate hydratase-proficient cells with cell-permeable fumarate. Loss of fumarate hydratase is associated with suppression of miR-200 and the EMT signature in renal cancer and is associated with poor clinical outcome. These results imply that loss of fumarate hydratase and fumarate accumulation contribute to the aggressive features of fumarate hydratase-deficient tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2507780804,"Homogeneous nucleation and subsequent cluster growth leads to the formation of new aerosol particles in the atmosphere. The nucleation of sulfuric acid and organic vapours is thought to be responsible for the formation of new particles over continents, whereas iodine oxide vapours have been implicated in particle formation over coastal regions. The molecular clustering pathways that are involved in atmospheric particle formation have been elucidated in controlled laboratory studies of chemically simple systems, but direct molecular-level observations of nucleation in atmospheric field conditions that involve sulfuric acid, organic or iodine oxide vapours have yet to be reported. Here we present field data from Mace Head, Ireland, and supporting data from northern Greenland and Queen Maud Land, Antarctica, that enable us to identify the molecular steps involved in new particle formation in an iodine-rich, coastal atmospheric environment. We find that the formation and initial growth process is almost exclusively driven by iodine oxoacids and iodine oxide vapours, with average oxygen-to-iodine ratios of 2.4 found in the clusters. On the basis of this high ratio, together with the high concentrations of iodic acid (HIO3) observed, we suggest that cluster formation primarily proceeds by sequential addition of HIO3, followed by intracluster restructuring to I2O5 and recycling of water either in the atmosphere or on dehydration. Our study provides ambient atmospheric molecular-level observations of nucleation, supporting the previously suggested role of iodine-containing species in the formation of new aerosol particles, and identifies the key nucleating compound."

Tumour progression is associated with reprogramming of the normal metabolic processes. But do metabolic regulatory circuits affect cancer metastasis? Pere Puigserver and colleagues address this question in melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. They find that PGC1α—a transcriptional coactivator known to promote biogenesis of mitochondria and to protect against oxidative stress—suppresses melanoma metastasis, through a transcriptional pathway that is parallel to, but distinct from, that leading to its bioenergetic functions. This pathway may offer an additional target for drugs that suppress metastasis through cytotoxic effects. Melanoma is the deadliest form of commonly encountered skin cancer because of its rapid progression towards metastasis1,2. Although metabolic reprogramming is tightly associated with tumour progression, the effect of metabolic regulatory circuits on metastatic processes is poorly understood. PGC1α is a transcriptional coactivator that promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, protects against oxidative stress3 and reprograms melanoma metabolism to influence drug sensitivity and survival4,5. Here, we provide data indicating that PGC1α suppresses melanoma metastasis, acting through a pathway distinct from that of its bioenergetic functions. Elevated PGC1α expression inversely correlates with vertical growth in human melanoma specimens. PGC1α silencing makes poorly metastatic melanoma cells highly invasive and, conversely, PGC1α reconstitution suppresses metastasis. Within populations of melanoma cells, there is a marked heterogeneity in PGC1α levels, which predicts their inherent high or low metastatic capacity. Mechanistically, PGC1α directly increases transcription of ID2, which in turn binds to and inactivates the transcription factor TCF4. Inactive TCF4 causes downregulation of metastasis-related genes, including integrins that are known to influence invasion and metastasis6,7,8. Inhibition of BRAFV600E using vemurafenib9, independently of its cytostatic effects, suppresses metastasis by acting on the PGC1α–ID2–TCF4–integrin axis. Together, our findings reveal that PGC1α maintains mitochondrial energetic metabolism and suppresses metastasis through direct regulation of parallel acting transcriptional programs. Consequently, components of these circuits define new therapeutic opportunities that may help to curb melanoma metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2516527128,"During speech processing, human listeners can separately analyze lexical and intonational cues to arrive at a unified representation of communicative content. The evolution of this capacity can be best investigated by comparative studies. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we explored whether and how dog brains segregate and integrate lexical and intonational information. We found a hemispheric bias for processing meaningful words, independently of intonation; an auditory brain region for distinguishing intonationally marked and unmarked words; and increased activity in primary reward regions only when both lexical and intonational information were consistent with praise. Neural mechanisms to separately analyze and integrate word meaning and intonation in dogs suggest that this capacity can evolve in the absence of language."
https://openalex.org/W2508920170,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal tumors, and reliable detection of early-stage pancreatic cancer and risk diseases for pancreatic cancer is essential to improve the prognosis. As 260 genes were previously reported to be upregulated in invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of pancreas (IDACP) cells, quantification of the corresponding proteins in plasma might be useful for IDACP diagnosis. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to identify plasma biomarkers for early detection of IDACP by using two proteomics strategies: antibody-based proteomics and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics. Among the 260 genes, we focused on 130 encoded proteins with known function for which antibodies were available. Twenty-three proteins showed values of the area under the curve (AUC) of more than 0.8 in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) data of IDACP patients compared with healthy controls, and these proteins were selected as biomarker candidates. We then used our high-throughput selected reaction monitoring or multiple reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM) methodology, together with an automated sample preparation system, micro LC and auto analysis system, to quantify these candidate proteins in plasma from healthy controls and IDACP patients on a large scale. The results revealed that insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)2 and IGFBP3 have the ability to discriminate IDACP patients at an early stage from healthy controls, and IGFBP2 appeared to be increased in risk diseases of pancreatic malignancy, such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Furthermore, diagnosis of IDACP using the combination of carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19-9), IGFBP2 and IGFBP3 is significantly more effective than CA19-9 alone. This suggests that IGFBP2 and IGFBP3 may serve as compensatory biomarkers for CA19-9. Early diagnosis with this marker combination may improve the prognosis of IDACP patients."
https://openalex.org/W2513541791,"Predatory bacteria are Gram-negative bacteria that prey on other Gram-negative bacteria and have been considered as potential therapeutic agents against multi-drug resistant pathogens. In vivo animal models have demonstrated that predatory bacteria are non-toxic and non-immunogenic in rodents. In order to consider the use of predatory bacteria as live antibiotics, it is important to investigate their effect on human cells. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus strains 109J and HD100, and Micavibrio aeruginosavorus strain ARL-13 on cell viability and inflammatory responses of five human cell lines, representative of clinically relevant tissues. We found that the predators were not cytotoxic to any of the human cell lines tested. Microscopic imaging showed no signs of cell detachment, as compared to predator-free cells. In comparison to an E. coli control, exposure to higher concentrations of the predators did not trigger a significant elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in four of the five human cell lines tested. Our work underlines the non-pathogenic attributes of predatory bacteria on human cells and highlights their potential use as live antibiotics against human pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2510955202,"Recovery efforts after natural disasters typically focus on physical infrastructure. In general less attention is paid to the social infrastructure that might impact the capacity of the community to rebuild. We examine perceptions of preparedness and recovery (markers of resilience at the community level) in the wake of Superstorm Sandy with a novel data set that includes a multi-mode survey of twelve neighborhoods severely affected by the storm. With these data, we suggest that social resources are associated with beliefs about neighborhood resilience. People who live in communities with higher social cohesion (coefficient = .73, p <.001), informal social control (coefficient = .53, p <.001), and social exchange (coefficient = .69, p <.001) are more likely to believe their neighborhoods are well prepared for a disaster. Likewise, people living in communities with higher social cohesion (coefficient = .35, p <.01), informal social control (coefficient = .27, p <.05), and social exchange (coefficient = .42, p <.001) are more likely to be confident their neighborhoods will recover quickly from a disaster. However, the effects of social resources on beliefs about resilience vary based on neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and the impact of the storm. Informal social control and social exchange lead to a greater increase in confidence in recovery in low, as compared to high, SES neighborhoods. Social resources tend to have more impact on perceptions of recovery in communities less affected by the storm. In sum, these findings suggest the potential value of various forms of social intervention to better equip communities to respond when disaster strikes."
https://openalex.org/W2513887564,"Metabolomics is a promising avenue for biomarker discovery. Although the quality of metabolomic analyses, especially global metabolomics (G-Met) using mass spectrometry (MS), largely depends on the instrumentation, potential bottlenecks still exist at several basic levels in the metabolomics workflow. Therefore, we established a precise protocol initially for the G-Met analyses of human blood plasma to overcome some these difficulties. In our protocol, samples are deproteinized in a 96-well plate using an automated liquid-handling system, and conducted either using a UHPLC-QTOF/MS system equipped with a reverse phase column or a LC-FTMS system equipped with a normal phase column. A normalization protocol of G-Met data was also developed to compensate for intra- and inter-batch differences, and the variations were significantly reduced along with our normalization, especially for the UHPLC-QTOF/MS data with a C18 reverse-phase column for positive ions. Secondly, we examined the changes in metabolomic profiles caused by the storage of EDTA-blood specimens to identify quality markers for the evaluation of the specimens' pre-analytical conditions. Forty quality markers, including lysophospholipids, dipeptides, fatty acids, succinic acid, amino acids, glucose, and uric acid were identified by G-Met for the evaluation of plasma sample quality and established the equation of calculating the quality score. We applied our quality markers to a small-scale study to evaluate the quality of clinical samples. The G-Met protocols and quality markers established here should prove useful for the discovery and development of biomarkers for a wider range of diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2514715990,"Androgen receptor (AR) is a validated drug target for all stages of prostate cancer including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). All current hormone therapies for CRPC target the C-terminal ligand-binding domain of AR and ultimately all fail with resumed AR transcriptional activity. Within the AR N-terminal domain (NTD) is activation function-1 (AF-1) that is essential for AR transcriptional activity. Inhibitors of AR AF-1 would potentially block most AR mechanisms of resistance including constitutively active AR splice variants that lack the ligand-binding domain. Here we provide evidence that sintokamide A (SINT1) binds AR AF-1 region to specifically inhibit transactivation of AR NTD. Consistent with SINT1 targeting AR AF-1, it attenuated transcriptional activities of both full-length AR and constitutively active AR splice variants, which correlated with inhibition of growth of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells expressing AR splice variants. In vivo, SINT1 caused regression of CRPC xenografts and reduced expression of prostate-specific antigen, a gene transcriptionally regulated by AR. Inhibition of AR activity by SINT1 was additive to EPI-002, a known AR AF-1 inhibitor that is in clinical trials (NCT02606123). This implies that SINT1 binds to a site on AF-1 that is unique from EPI. Consistent with this suggestion, these two compounds showed differences in blocking AR interaction with STAT3.

Approximately 20–40% of patients treated for localized prostate cancer will have recurrence. The current therapy for these patients is hormone therapy such as orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs followed by antiandrogens and 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17) inhibitors. Current hormone therapies all target the ligand-binding domain (LBD) 2The abbreviations used are: LBD, ligand-binding domain; DBD, DNA-binding domain; AR, androgen receptor; CRPC, castration-resistant prostate cancer; mCRPC, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; AF-1, activation function-1; NTD, N-terminal domain; FL-AR, full-length AR; Tau, transcriptional activation unit; SINT1, sintokamide A; PR, progesterone receptor; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; PB, probasin; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; PRE, progesterone response element; Luc, luciferase; ANOVA, analysis of variance; AR-V, AR splice variant; ENO2, neuron-specific enolase; SYP, synaptophysin. of androgen receptor (AR) and will eventually fail, giving rise to lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). CRPC is characterized by a recurrent rise of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels despite castrate blood levels of androgen. PSA is an androgen-regulated gene that is dependent upon AR transactivation. Therefore, a rising PSA level despite castrate serum levels of androgen suggests continued AR transactivation. One probable AR mechanism of resistance to hormone therapies associated with increasing PSA levels is expression of constitutively active AR splice variants that lack the LBD. Transcriptional activity of AR resides within the activation function-1 (AF-1) region, which is essential for transcriptional activities of both full-length AR (FL-AR) and constitutively active AR splice variants lacking the LBD (1.Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. van Vroonhoven C. van der Kwast T.H.

The prodrug of EPI-002, EPI-506, is currently in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for prostate cancer patients in the United States and Canada (NCT02606123). Sintokamide A (SINT1) is a natural compound isolated and purified from the marine sponge Dysidea sp. (7.Sadar M.D. Williams D.E. Mawji N.R. Patrick B.O. Wikanta T. Chasanah E. Irianto H.E. Soest R.V. Andersen R.J.

Interest in SINT1 is drawn from the fact that it blocks transactivation of the AR NTD and inhibits AR-dependent proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro (7.Sadar M.D. Williams D.E. Mawji N.R. Patrick B.O. Wikanta T. Chasanah E. Irianto H.E. Soest R.V. Andersen R.J.

Here the specificity of SINT1 toward AR and its ability to inhibit the growth of CRPC xenografts were investigated. The mechanism of action of SINT1 involved binding to AF-1 to specifically block the transcriptional activities of FL-AR and splice variant ARs without attenuating the transcriptional activities of structurally related steroid hormone receptors. SINT1 blocked transactivation of AR NTD induced by stimulation of the PKA pathway, but contrary to EPI, SINT1 had no effect on IL-6-induced transactivation of AR NTD. This suggests that SINT1 binds to a different region of AF-1 compared with EPI. Consistent with SINT1 binding to a unique site on AF-1 from EPI, SINT1 did not prevent interaction between endogenous AR and STAT3 in response to IL-6, whereas EPI did. Lastly, the additive affect observed when SINT1 was combined with EPI was consistent with EPI and SINT1 having different mechanisms of action. In vivo, SINT1 reduced proliferation and caused regression of CRPC xenografts as well as decreased expression of the AR-regulated gene PSA.

LNCaP cells were preincubated with EPI-002 (35 μm), SINT1 (20 μm), or DMSO (vehicle control) for 1 h before treatment for 6 h with 50 ng/ml IL-6. Whole cell lysates were prepared from harvested cells in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Cell lysates were precleared with 2 μg of normal mouse IgG and 20 μl of Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to remove nonspecific bead binding. Total STAT3 was immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of antibody against STAT3 (124H6) or 10 μg of normal mouse IgG as a negative control followed by probing the immunoblot with anti-AR antibody (AR-N20; 1:1000) and anti-STAT3 antibody (124H6; 1:1000) and normalizing to levels of β-actin (1:10,000) as loading controls. The input lanes were loaded with 5 μg of the starting cell lysate. The relative density of AR for each immunoprecipitated sample was quantified by ImageJ software and normalized to levels of STAT3 pulled down. LNCaP cells were transfected with AR-responsive PSA (6.1 kb)-luciferase, PB-luciferase, and ARR3-luciferase reporters. Forty-eight hours later, cells were pretreated for 1 h with SINT1 (0–24 μm), EPI-002 (0–31 μm), or a combination with a constant ratio of 1:1.3 for EPI-002/SINT1 concentration. Cells were then incubated with 1 nm R1881 for 48 h, and a luciferase assay was performed. IC50 values for SINT1 for the three reporters were calculated using GraphPad Prism (version 6.01; GraphPad Software). The combination index of SINT1 and EPI-002 was calculated using CalcuSyn software. Combination indices >1, 1, and <1 indicate antagonism, additive affect, and synergy, respectively. COS-1 cells (AR-negative) were co-transfected with the PB-luciferase reporter and the expression plasmid ARvar567es encoding the constitutively active AR splice variant that lacks the LBD. Six hours after transfection, cells were pretreated for 1 h with 20 μm SINT1, 25 μm EPI-002, 10 μm bicalutamide, 1 μm enzalutamide, or vehicle before incubation with R1881 for another 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured and normalized to protein concentration. Levels of expression of AR variant were determined by Western blotting using 10 μg of total protein extracted from same plates (3 wells per condition) using AR-N20 antibody (1:1000) and goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:10,000). LNCaP and LNCaP95 cells were pretreated for 1 h with SINT1, EPI-002, bicalutamide, enzalutamide, or vehicle before addition of 0.1 nm R1881 (LNCaP) under serum-free and phenol red-free conditions and then incubated for another 48 (LNCaP95) or 72 h (LNCaP). Cells were pulse-labeled with 10 μm BrdU for 2 h. Cells were fixed, and BrdU-labeled cells were identified with anti-BrdU-peroxidase (Roche Applied Science). BrdU incorporation was measured at 570 nm using a VersaMax ELISA microplate reader (Molecular Devices). At least three independent experiments with six technical replicates were analyzed, and average values are indicated. LNCaP cells seeded on coverslips were transiently transfected with an expression vector for AR-YFP for 24 h prior to pretreatment for 1 h with 10 μm SINT1, 10 μm bicalutamide, 10 μm enzalutamide, or vehicle. Cells were exposed to 1 nm R1881 for an additional 2 h, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and mounted in Vectashield antifade mounting medium with DAPI (H-1200, Vector Laboratories). Cellular localization of AR was examined by fluorescence microscopy using an Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a YFP filter (excitation, 500/20 nm; emission, 535/30 nm; Zeiss, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Images were taken using a Axiocam MR camera and the AxioVision 4.4 software (Zeiss, Toronto, ON, Canada). LNCaP95 cells plated in 10% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped FBS, RMPI 1640 medium were pretreated with 10 μm bicalutamide, 10 μm SINT1, or 5 μm enzalutamide under serum-free and phenol-free RPMI 1640 medium conditions for 1 h before adding 1 nm synthetic androgen R1881 or vehicle (EtOH). At 48 h, total RNA was isolated using a PureLink RNA Mini kit (Invitrogen). For in vivo expression, tumors were harvested 3 days after last treatment, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol. Prior to cDNA generation, 4 μg of RNA were DNase-treated using DNase I (amplification grade; Sigma-Aldrich). DNase-treated RNA was split into two tubes (+RT and −RT), and cDNA was generated using the High Capacity RNA-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems). Once complete, both reactions were adjusted to 5 ng/μl and stored at −20 °C. Approximately 5 ng of diluted cDNA and gene-specific primers were mixed with Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG with ROX (Invitrogen). The transcripts were measured using an ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System (Invitrogen). For all quantitative RT-PCR experiments, each sample was tested in triplicate, and gene expression levels were normalized to the reference gene RPL13A. Neuron-specific enolase (ENO2) (Gene ID, 2026; pair 1) and synaptophysin (SYP) (Gene ID, 6855; pair 2) human primers were from Sigma Life Science.

Pharmacokinetics assays were performed by NAEJA Pharmaceutical Inc. in a total of 27 CD-1 mice, which received a single intravenous SINT1 dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight. Blood samples were collected during a period of 2.5 min to 8 h postdosing from three mice per time point. Plasma concentrations of SINT1 and pharmacokinetics parameters were determined. Male NOD-SCID mice bearing subcutaneous LNCaP or LNCaP95 tumors were castrated when the tumor volume reached ∼100 mm3. Seven days after castration, animals were injected intratumorally with 30 mg/kg of body weight SINT1 or a matching volume of vehicle (DMSO) every 3 days for a total of 15 days. Animal behavior and body weight were observed throughout the study period for signs of toxicity. Tumor volumes were calculated by the formula length × width × height × 0.5236. Tumors were excised 3 days after the last injection and prepared for immunohistochemistry or gene expression. Xenograft sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and for Ki67 expression by Wax it Histology Inc. Cells that were positive for Ki67 were counted in sections from three xenografts for each treatment. For PSA and AR staining, dewaxed sections were microwaved for 10 min on full power in prewarmed Antigen Unmasking Solution (pH 6; Vector Laboratories, Inc.). The endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in 3% H2O2 for 10 min followed by incubation in Clear Vision Histostaining Blocking Solution (UniCure Lab, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated with AR-N20 (1:500 dilution) and PSA (1:5 dilution; overnight at 4 °C) primary antibodies. Samples were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with secondary antibodies and mounted in Permount mounting medium (SP15–100, Fisher). One-way ANOVA Dunnett's multiple comparison test was performed using GraphPad software unless stated otherwise, and differences were considered statistically significant at p values less than 0.05. AR has high sequence homology with related steroid hormone receptors such as PR and GR in their DBDs and LBDs. These related steroid hormone receptors also interact with many of the same coactivators and other proteins. Therefore, to determine the specificity of SINT1 for AR, we tested whether SINT1 would inhibit PR or GR transcriptional activities. SINT1 significantly inhibited androgen-induced activity of endogenous AR using the synthetic androgen R1881 (Fig. 1A), which was consistent with a previous report (7.Sadar M.D. Williams D.E. Mawji N.R. Patrick B.O. Wikanta T. Chasanah E. Irianto H.E. Soest R.V. Andersen R.J. Sintokamides A to E, chlorinated peptides from the sponge Dysidea sp. that inhibit transactivation of the N-terminus of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.Org Lett. 2008; 10: 4947-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Importantly, SINT1 did not affect the transcriptional activities of PR or GR (Fig. 1A). The antiandrogen bicalutamide inhibited both AR and PR transcriptional activities as reported previously (10.Poujol N. Wurtz J.M. Tahiri B. Lumbroso S. Nicolas J.C. Moras D. Sultan C. Specific recognition of androgens by their nuclear receptor. A structure-function study.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24022-24031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These data support that SINT1 specifically inhibits AR transcriptional activity and that it is not a general inhibitor of transcription or translation because neither GR nor PR transcriptional activities were decreased. To determine whether the mechanism of action of SINT1 to inhibit androgen-induced AR transcriptional activity was mediated by binding to AR LBD, a fluorescence polarization competition assay was used. This assay uses recombinant AR LBD to reveal whether a test compound competes for ligand binding of Fluoromone that binds to this domain. R1881, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide are all known ligands of AR LBD, and as expected each competed with Fluoromone (Fig. 1B). SINT1 and EPI-002 (negative control) (4.Andersen R.J. Mawji N.R. Wang J. Wang G. Haile S. Myung J.K. Watt K. Tam T. Yang Y.C. Bañuelos C.A. Williams D.E. McEwan I.J. Wang Y.

These data revealed that SINT1 does not interfere with ligand binding to AR LBD and suggests that SINT1 is not a ligand of AR LBD. AR signaling involves its nuclear translocation upon binding of ligand to the LBD. Antiandrogens are LBD ligands that can induce nuclear translocation of AR in the absence of androgen. In the absence of androgen, AR remained cytoplasmic in cells treated with SINT1 (Fig. 1C) contrary to antiandrogens that induced nuclear translocation as reported (5.Myung J.K. Banuelos C.A.

https://openalex.org/W2516135243,"Acute radiation sickness (ARS) following exposure to ionizing irradiation is characterized by radiation-induced multiorgan dysfunction/failure that refers to progressive dysfunction of two or more organ systems, the etiological agent being radiation damage to cells and tissues over time. Radiation sensitivity data on humans and animals has made it possible to describe the signs associated with ARS. A mouse model of total-body irradiation (TBI) has previously been developed that represents the likely scenario of exposure in the human population. Herein, we present the Mouse Intervention Scoring System (MISS) developed at the Veterinary Sciences Department (VSD) of the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) to identify moribund mice and decrease the numbers of mice found dead, which is therefore a more humane refinement to death as the endpoint. Survival rates were compared to changes in body weights and temperatures in the mouse (CD2F1 male) TBI model (6-14 Gy, 60Co γ-rays at 0.6 Gy min-1), which informed improvements to the Scoring System. Individual tracking of animals via implanted microchips allowed for assessment of criteria based on individuals rather than by group averages. From a total of 132 mice (92 irradiated), 51 mice were euthanized versus only four mice that were found dead (7% of non-survivors). In this case, all four mice were found dead after overnight periods between observations. Weight loss alone was indicative of imminent succumbing to radiation injury, however mice did not always become moribund within 24 hours while having weight loss >30%. Only one survivor had a weight loss of greater than 30%. Temperature significantly dropped only 2-4 days before death/euthanasia in 10 and 14 Gy animals. The score system demonstrates a significant refinement as compared to using subjective assessment of morbidity or death as the endpoint for these survival studies."
https://openalex.org/W2508484027,"The in situ oxygen partial pressure in normal and tumor tissues is in the range of a few percent. Therefore, when studying cell growth in 3D culture systems, it is essential to consider how the physiological oxygen concentration, rather than the one in the ambient air, influences the proliferation parameters. Here, we investigated the effect of reducing oxygen partial pressure from 21% to 5% on cell proliferation rate and regionalization in a 3D tumor spheroid model. We found that 5% oxygen concentration strongly inhibited spheroid growth, changed the proliferation gradient and reduced the 50% In Depth Proliferation index (IDP50), compared with culture at 21% oxygen. We then modeled the oxygen partial pressure profiles using the experimental data generated by culturing spheroids in physioxic and normoxic conditions. Although hypoxia occurred at similar depth in spheroids grown in the two conditions, oxygen partial pressure was a major rate-limiting factor with a critical effect on cell proliferation rate and regionalization only in spheroids grown in physioxic condition and not in spheroids grown at atmospheric normoxia. Our findings strengthen the need to consider conducting experiment in physioxic conditions (i.e., tissue normoxia) for proper understanding of cancer cell biology and the evaluation of anticancer drugs in 3D culture systems."
https://openalex.org/W2516965353,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and different subtypes of breast cancer show distinct cellular morphology, gene expression, metabolism, motility, proliferation, and metastatic potential. Understanding the molecular features responsible for this heterogeneity is important for correct diagnosis and better treatment strategies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their associated molecules have gained much attention as players in intercellular communication, ability to precondition specific organs for metastatic invasion, and for their potential role as circulating cancer biomarkers. EVs are released from the cells and contain proteins, DNA, and long and small RNA species. Here we show by high-throughput small RNA-sequencing that EVs from nine different breast cancer cell lines share common characteristics in terms of small RNA content that are distinct from their originating cells. Most strikingly, a highly abundant small RNA molecule derived from the nuclear 28S rRNA is vastly enriched in EVs. The miRNA profiles in EVs correlate with the cellular miRNA expression pattern, but with a few exceptions that includes miR-21. This cancer-associated miRNA is retained in breast cancer cell lines. Finally, we report that EVs from breast cancer cell lines cluster together based on their small RNA signature when compared to EVs derived from other cancer cell lines. Altogether, our data demonstrate that breast cancer cell lines manifest a specific small RNA signature in their released EVs. This opens up for further evaluation of EVs as breast cancer biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2508598819,"Our current understanding of pre-Columbian history in the Americas rests in part on several trends identified in recent genetic studies. The goal of this study is to reexamine these trends in light of the impact of post-Columbian admixture and the methods used to study admixture. The previously-published data consist of 645 autosomal microsatellite genotypes from 1046 individuals in 63 populations. We used STRUCTURE to estimate ancestry proportions and tested the sensitivity of these estimates to the choice of the number of clusters, K. We used partial correlation analyses to examine the relationship between gene diversity and geographic distance from Beringia, controlling for non-Native American ancestry (from Africa, Europe and East Asia), and taking into account alternative paths of migration. Principal component analysis and multidimensional scaling were used to investigate the relationships between Andean and non-Andean populations and to explore gene-language correspondence. We found that 1) European and East Asian ancestry estimates decline as K increases, especially in Native Canadian populations, 2) a north-south decline in gene diversity is driven by low diversity in Amazonian and Paraguayan populations, not serial founder effects from Beringia, 3) controlling for non-Native American ancestry, populations in the Andes and Mesoamerica have higher gene diversity than populations in other regions, and 4) patterns of genetic and linguistic diversity are poorly correlated. We conclude that patterns of diversity previously attributed to pre-Columbian processes may in part reflect post-Columbian admixture and the choice of K in STRUCTURE analyses. Accounting for admixture, the pattern of diversity is inconsistent with a north-south founder effect process, though the genetic similarities between Mesoamerican and Andean populations are consistent with rapid dispersal along the western coast of the Americas. Further, even setting aside the disruptive effects of European contact, gene-language congruence is unlikely to have ever existed at the geographic scale analyzed here."
https://openalex.org/W2510252460,"Recent findings suggest that memory allocation to specific neurons (i.e., neuronal allocation) in the amygdala is not random, but rather the transcription factor cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) modulates this process, perhaps by regulating the transcription of channels that control neuronal excitability. Here, optogenetic studies in the mouse lateral amygdala (LA) were used to demonstrate that CREB and neuronal excitability regulate which neurons encode an emotional memory. To test the role of CREB in memory allocation, we overexpressed CREB in the lateral amygdala to recruit the encoding of an auditory-fear conditioning (AFC) memory to a subset of neurons. Then, post-training activation of these neurons with Channelrhodopsin-2 was sufficient to trigger recall of the memory for AFC, suggesting that CREB regulates memory allocation. To test the role of neuronal excitability in memory allocation, we used a step function opsin (SFO) to transiently increase neuronal excitability in a subset of LA neurons during AFC. Post-training activation of these neurons with Volvox Channelrhodopsin-1 was able to trigger recall of that memory. Importantly, our studies show that activation of the SFO did not affect AFC by either increasing anxiety or by strengthening the unconditioned stimulus. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that CREB regulates memory allocation by modulating neuronal excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2509820485,"Knowledge of length-weight relationships for commercially exploited fish is an important tool for assessing and managing of fish stocks. However, analyses of length-weight relationship fisheries data typically do not consider the inherent differences in length-weight relationships for fish caught from different habitats, seasons, or years, and this can affect the utility of these data for developing condition indices or calculating fisheries biomass. Here, we investigated length-weight relationships for ribbonfish Trichiurus lepturus in the waters of the Arabian Sea off Oman collected during three periods (2001-02, 2007-08, and 2014-15) and showed that a multivariate modelling approach that considers the areas and seasons in which ribbonfish were caught improved estimation of length-weight relationships. We used the outputs of these models to explore spatio-temporal variations in condition indices and relative weights among ribbonfish, revealing fish of 85-125 cm were in the best overall condition. We also found that condition differed according to where and when fish were caught, with condition lowest during spring and pre-south-west monsoon periods and highest during and after the south-west monsoons. We interpret these differences to be a consequence of variability in temperature and food availability. Based on our findings, we suggest fishing during seasons that have the lowest impact on fish condition and which are commercially most viable; such fishery management would enhance fisheries conservation and economic revenue in the region."

In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved by β-secretase (BACE-1) to generate a 99-amino acid membrane-bound protein C99 and soluble APPβ. C99 is further cleaved by γ-secretase to produce the Aβ peptide. APP is also cleaved by α-secretase within the Aβ domain generating an 83-kDa protein C83. Subsequent cleavage of C83 by γ-secretase generates a nontoxic short peptide P3 containing the C-terminal region of Aβ. BACE-1 cleavage of APP is the rate-limiting step in Aβ production.

Thus, several cellular events triggered by vascular insults elevate BACE-1 levels in the brain. It has been suggested that the biochemical pathway that is activated by vascular injuries may be involved in up-regulating BACE-1 and initiating AD pathology in the brain (13.Cole S.L. Vassar R.

Early growth response 1 (Egr-1) is a zinc finger transcription factor and is involved in regulation of a number of cell functions, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell growth, and signal transduction. The cellular level of Egr-1 is relatively low, but its biosynthesis is induced by many environmental signals, including growth factors, hormones, and neurotransmitters (14.Beckmann A.M. Wilce P.A.

Once induced, it binds to targets genes and regulates their expression. More importantly, in the CNS, Egr-1 is induced during ischemic stroke, hypoxia, brain injury, and inflammation and plays an important role in the induction and maintenance of various vascular pathologies (14.Beckmann A.M.

Early and sustained altered expression of aging-related genes in young 3xTg-AD mice.Cell Death Dis. 2014; 5: e1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As discussed above, BACE-1 expression is up-regulated during vascular injuries (13.Cole S.L. Vassar R. Linking vascular disorders and Alzheimer's disease: potential involvement of BACE1.Neurobiol. Aging. 2009; 30: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This observation promoted us to examine whether Egr-1 regulates BACE-1 expression in the brain. Herein, we show that Egr-1 is a transcriptional activator of the BACE-1 gene. We demonstrate that Egr-1 promotes Aβ synthesis by activating BACE-1 in neurons. Our data suggest that Egr-1 may be involved in the activation of BACE-1 leading to acceleration of Aβ synthesis in AD brain. By sandwich ELISA, we determined that the amount of Aβ42 in the brain extract of WT mice was 12.1 pmol/g wet brain (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the amount of Aβ42 in the age-matched KO mice was 6.9 pmol/g wet brain. Likewise, the amount of Aβ40 was 28.5 pmol/g wet brain in the WT mice and 15.6 pmol/g wet brain in the KO mice. Thus, compared with the WT, Egr-1 KO mice had 43% less Aβ42 and 45.3% less Aβ40 in the brain. Western blotting analysis confirmed the ELISA data and showed that compared with the WT, Egr-1 KO mice had 68.5 and 58.8% reduced Aβ42 and Aβ40, respectively, in the brain (Fig. 1B). This result determined that Egr-1 KO mice have significantly reduced levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the brain. Aβ is generated and eliminated continuously, and its level in the brain is mainly controlled by its synthesis and clearance. The proteolytic degradation is a major route of Aβ clearance (24.Mukherjee A. Hersh L.B. Regulation of amyloid β-peptide levels by enzymatic degradation.J. Alzheimers Dis. 2002; 4: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Neprilysin and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) are among the main Aβ-degrading enzymes that have been identified to date (24.Mukherjee A. Hersh L.B. Regulation of amyloid β-peptide levels by enzymatic degradation.J. Alzheimers Dis. 2002; 4: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25.Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y. Shirotani K. Lu B.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4162-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis determined that levels of both neprilysin and IDE were similar in Egr-1 KO and WT mouse brains (Fig. 2A). These data indicated that genetic deletion of Egr-1 does not affect levels of neprilysin and IDE in the brain. Synthesis of Aβ occurs by a sequential cleavage of APP by BACE-1 and γ-secretase. Although BACE-1 is a monomeric enzyme, γ-secretase is a multimeric enzyme with presenilin 1 (PS1) or presenilin 2 (PS2) being the catalytic subunit (1.Vassar R. Kovacs D.M. Yan R. Wong P.C. The β-secretase enzyme BACE in health and Alzheimer's disease: regulation, cell biology, function, and therapeutic potential.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 28.Sisodia S.S. St George-Hyslop P.H. γ-Secretase, Notch, Aβ and Alzheimer's disease: where do the presenilins fit in?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine whether Egr-1 regulates any of the enzymes involved in Aβ synthesis, we analyzed levels of PS1 and PS2 in mice brains (Fig. 2A). Western blotting analysis determined that the levels of both PS1 and PS2 were similar in KO and WT mice. However, in Egr-1 KO mice, the BACE-1 protein level was 40% less than in the WT. Likewise, qPCR analysis showed that compared with the WT, the level of BACE-1 mRNA was 35% less in KO mice (Fig. 2B). Fluorogenic activity assay confirmed the Western blotting and qPCR data and showed that BACE-1 activity was 37% less in Egr-1 KO than in the WT mice. Immunohistochemistry of the brain sections showed BACE-1 immunoreactivity was 1.8- and 2.1-fold less in the hippocampus and cortex, respectively, of the KO than the WT mice (Fig. 2C). Based on these data, we concluded that compared with the WT, Egr-1 KO mice have significantly reduced BACE-1 in the brain. APP is cleaved by either α-secretase or BACE-1 followed by γ-secretase. While BACE-1 cleavage generates C-terminal C99 and N-terminal sAPPβ, α-secretase cleavage generates C83 and sAPPα (1.Vassar R. Kovacs D.M. Yan R. Wong P.C. The β-secretase enzyme BACE in health and Alzheimer's disease: regulation, cell biology, function, and therapeutic potential.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). To substantiate the above data, we analyzed levels of APP metabolites in the brain extracts of mice. As shown in Fig. 3, the levels of both C99 and sAPPβ were 48.8 and 37.6%, respectively, less in KO mice when compared with WT. In contrast, α-secretase-generated sAPPα and C83 were similar in the two experimental groups. The amount of C99/C83 ratio, which is an indicator of amyloidogenic APP metabolism, was 47.8% less in KO mice than the WT. To further substantiate the brain data, we analyzed rat hippocampal primary neurons infected with Ln-Egr-1. Neurons expressing Egr-1 displayed significantly elevated levels of BACE-1, C99, sAPPβ, and Aβ42 when compared with Ln vector-infected neurons (see below). Based on these results, we concluded that Egr-1 KO mice have significantly reduced BACE-1 level in the brain, and overexpression of Egr-1 promotes BACE-1 expression in neurons. Recently, a genome-wide investigation of in vivo Egr-1-binding sites determined that Egr-1 binds to a GC-rich sequence of its target genes (29.Kubosaki A. Tomaru Y. Tagami M. Arner E. Miura H. Suzuki T. Suzuki M. Suzuki H. Hayashizaki Y. Genome-wide investigation of in vivo EGR-1 binding sites in monocytic differentiation.Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R41Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on the criteria deduced by this study, we identified five putative Egr-1-binding sites within the BACE-1 promoter located upstream from the transcription initiation site. To determine whether Egr-1 binds to any of these sites and induces BACE-1 transcription, we cloned the following five BACE-1 promoter fragments upstream from the luciferase reporter gene PGL3: Luc-1600 containing the promoter; most of the UTR sequence and all five putative Egr-1-binding sites; and deletion mutants Luc-800, Luc-300, Luc-166, Luc-144, and Luc-65 (Fig. 4A). We co-transfected each of these fragments and control Luc-0 (basic PGL3 empty vector) with Egr-1 in COS-7 cells and monitored luciferase activity (Fig. 4B). Compared with Luc-0, Luc-1600, Luc-800, and Luc-300 displayed 8.3-, 8.1-, and 10.3-fold more luciferase activity, respectively (Fig. 4B, upper panel). However, luciferase activity of Luc-166 was similar to that of Luc-0. Likewise, Luc-144 and Luc-65 also displayed luciferase activity similar to Luc-0 control. These data determined that the Egr-1-binding site is located in-between 166 and 300 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. A GC-rich sequence is located within the −275–283 segment of the BACE-1 promoter (Fig. 4A). To determine whether this segment contributes to Egr-1 binding, we mutated six bases within this segment of Luc-300 (Luc-300M) (Fig. 4A) and performed luciferase assay. Although Luc-300 showed 10.2-fold higher activity, Luc-300M displayed luciferase activity similar to that of Luc-0 (Fig. 4B, lower panel). Thus, either deletion or mutation of the above segment abolished Egr-1-induced luciferase activity of the BACE-1 promoter. This result determined that Egr-1 binds to the putative segments of BACE-1 promoter and induces BACE-1 expression. Egr-1 regulates the expression of various genes by binding to their promoters (30.Knapska E. Kaczmarek L. A gene for neuronal plasticity in the mammalian brain: Zif268/Egr-1/NGFI-A/Krox-24/TIS8/ZENK?.Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 74: 183-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Egr-1 expression is induced when COS-7 cells are exposed to PMA (31.Qin X. Jiang Y. Tse Y.C. Wang Y. Wong T.P. Paudel H.K. Early growth response 1 (Egr-1) regulates N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent transcription of PSD-95 and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) trafficking in hippocampal primary neurons.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 29603-29616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PMA also promotes BACE-1 expression in U937 cells and primary CD14+ human monocytes (32.Woodard-Grice A.V. McBrayer A.C. Wakefield J.K. Zhuo Y. Bellis S.L. Proteolytic shedding of ST6Gal-I by BACE1 regulates the glycosylation and function of α4β1 integrins.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26364-26373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). By semiquantitative PCR, we found that PMA induces BACE-1 expression in COS-7 cells also (Fig. 5A). Therefore, to determine whether Egr-1 binds to the BACE-1 promoter in response to PMA exposure, we performed a ChIP assay using anti-Egr-1 antibody and primers flanking the Egr-1-binding site on the BACE-1 promoter, identified by luciferase assay (Table 1 for list of primers used). As the control, we amplified GAPDH (Fig. 5B). In vehicle-treated cells, we observed a basal level of promoter amplification from both IgG and anti-Egr-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5B, upper panel). However, from PMA-treated cells, the BACE-1 promoter amplification was 4.1-fold higher from anti-Egr-1 than from IgG control. No amplification was observed for GAPDH control. More importantly, compared with vehicle-treated cells, PMA-treated cells displayed 7.3-fold more BACE-1 amplification (Fig. 5B, lower panel). These data indicated that 7.3-fold more Egr-1 is complex with the BACE-1 promoter in cells treated with PMA than those treated with vehicle. This in turn indicated that PMA exposure causes recruitment of Egr-1 onto the BACE-1 promoter.TABLE 1Primer listView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab If Egr-1 induces BACE-1 transcription, BACE-1 expression will be expected to follow binding of Egr-1 to the BACE-1 promoter. To demonstrate this, we monitored the time course of Egr-1 recruitment to the BACE-1 promoter and BACE-1 expression (Fig. 5C). PMA exposures caused a rapid recruitment of Egr-1 to the BACE-1 promoter that peaked at 1 h and slowly declined over the next 8 h (Fig. 5C, lower). BACE-1 expression, however, was relatively slow, peaked at 2 h, and then declined. Thus, recruitment of Egr-1 to BACE-1 promoter preceded BACE-1 expression in PMA-treated COS-7 cells. Based on these data, we concluded that Egr-1 binds to the BACE-1 promoter and induces BACE-1 expression in PMA-exposed COS-7 cells. We found that Egr-1 KO mice have reduced levels of both Aβ and BACE-1 (FIGURE 1., FIGURE 2.). In addition, our data showed that Egr-1 is a transcriptional activator of the BACE-1 gene (Fig. 4). BACE-1 catalyzes the committed step in Aβ synthesis (1.Vassar R. Kovacs D.M. Yan R. Wong P.C. The β-secretase enzyme BACE in health and Alzheimer's disease: regulation, cell biology, function, and therapeutic potential.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). However, the level of Aβ in the brain is regulated by its synthesis and clearance (24.Mukherjee A. Hersh L.B. Regulation of amyloid β-peptide levels by enzymatic degradation.J. Alzheimers Dis. 2002; 4: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether Egr-1 promotes Aβ synthesis via activating BACE-1, we infected rat hippocampal primary neurons with Ln-Egr-1 and analyzed neuronal lysate and conditional medium. Western blotting, BACE-1 activity assay, and qPCR analysis determined that the protein, mRNA, and activity levels of BACE-1 were 1.7-, 1.6-, and 2.8-fold, respectively, higher in Egr-1-overexpressing neurons when compared with those expressing vector (Fig. 6A). Immunocytochemistry confirmed the Western data and showed that the BACE-1 level was 1.85-fold higher in neurons expressing Egr-1 than vector (Fig. 6B). Thus, Egr-1 overexpression enhanced the levels of BACE-1 mRNA, protein, and activity in primary neurons. We then analyzed levels of APP metabolites in the neuronal lysates and medium. In the lysates of Ln-Egr-1-infected neurons, although the level of C99 was 2.4-fold higher, that of C83 was 2.2-fold reduced when compared with vector-infected counterparts (Fig. 6A). As a result, the C99/C83 ratio in neurons infected with Ln-Egr-1 was 5.2-fold higher than in neurons infected with Ln vector. Western blots showed that in the medium of neurons infected with Ln-Egr-1, the level of sAPPβ was 1.9-fold higher than in the medium of those infected with Ln vector. In contrast, in the medium of neurons infected with Ln-Egr-1, the level of sAPPα was 2.1-fold lower than in the medium of those infected with Ln vector. Likewise, ELISA of medium determined that amount of secreted Aβ42 was 2.1-fold more in Egr-1-expressing neurons when compared with those expressing vector. Thus, overexpression of Egr-1 activated BACE-1, accelerated formation of BACE-1-generated C99 and sAPPβ, reduced α-secretase-cleaved C83 and sAPPα, and increased Aβ42 in neurons. To substantiate the neuron data, we co-transfected COS-7 cells with Egr-1 and APPSwe in different combinations and analyzed them. In cells expressing Egr-1, BACE-1 protein, mRNA, and activity levels were 3.2-, 3.9-, and 9.3-fold higher, respectively, than in vector-expressing cells (Fig. 7A). Thus, as in neurons Egr-1 overexpression activated BACE-1. In cells expressing APPSwe and vector, the major APP-cleaved product was C83 generated by α-secretase (Fig. 7B). In contrast, in cells expressing APPSwe and Egr-1, the major APP-cleaved product was C99 generated by BACE-1. Furthermore, compared with APPSwe-expressing cells, those expressing APPSwe and Egr-1 had a C99/C83 ratio 3.46-fold higher and secreted 2.2- and 3.1-fold more sAPPβ and Aβ42, respectively, in the medium (Fig. 7B). These data indicated that Egr-1 overexpression activates BACE-1 and accelerates amyloidogenic APP cleavage and Aβ42 synthesis in COS-7 cells. If Egr-1 promotes Aβ synthesis by activating BACE-1, knockdown of BACE-1 will be expected to block Egr-1-induced amyloidogenic APP processing. To demonstrate this, we silenced BACE-1 in mouse hippocampal primary neurons using shRNA-BACE-1 and analyzed them (Fig. 8). Compared with neurons infected with shRNA-ctl, those infected with shRNA-BACE-1 displayed 58 and 65% reduction in levels of BACE-1 protein and BACE-1 activity, respectively, but had similar levels of tubulin (compare lane 3 with lane 1 in Fig. 8A). Likewise, compared with control neurons co-infected with Ln vector and shRNA-ctl, those co-infected with Ln-Egr-1 and shRNA-ctl displayed 1.6- and 2.1-fold higher BACE-1 protein and activity, respectively, a 1.8-fold higher level of C99 but a reduced level of C83, a 2.6-fold higher C99/C83, a 1.8-fold more sAPPβ, and 1.5-fold more Aβ42 (compare lane 2 with lane 1 in Fig. 8B). These data are as expected and showed that Egr-1 activates BACE-1 and accelerates amyloidogenic APP processing, and shRNA-BACE-1 had specifically silenced BACE-1 in these neurons. Importantly, compared with neurons co-infected with Ln-Egr-1 and shRNA-ctl, those co-infected with Ln-Egr-1 and shRNA-BACE-1 had C99 levels 75% less (compare lane 3 with lane 2 in Fig. 8B). Likewise, levels of sAPPβ and Aβ42 were 72 and 69%, respectively, less in neurons co-infected with Ln-Egr-1 and shRNA-BACE-1 when compared with those co-infected with Ln-Egr-1 and shRNA-ctl (compare lane 3 with lane 2 in Fig. 8C). Thus, silencing BACE-1 action almost completely blocked Egr-1-induced amyloidogenic APP processing in neurons. Based on these data, we concluded that Egr-1-promoted amyloidogenic APP processing leading to Aβ synthesis requires BACE-1. Previous studies have shown that Aβ42 exposure activates BACE-1 in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (33.Faghihi M.A. Modarresi F. Khalil A.M. Wood D.E. Sahagan B.G. Morgan T.E. Finch C.E.

Because BACE-1 catalyzes a committed step in Aβ synthesis and Aβ causes neurodegeneration in various in vitro and in vivo models (35.Hardy J. Bogdanovic N. Winblad B. Portelius E. Andreasen N.

We aimed to establish a non-invasive score for prediction of NAFLD in Han Chinese, the largest ethnic group in the world, and detect whether ethnicity influences the accuracy of such a score.Liver fat content (LFAT) was measured by quantitative ultrasound in 3548 subjects in the Shanghai Changfeng Community and a Chinese score was created using multivariate logistic regression analyses. This new score was internally validated in Chinese and externally in Finns. Its diagnostic performance was compared to the NAFLD liver fat score, fatty liver index (FLI) and hepatic steatosis index (HSI) developed in Finns, Italians and Koreans. We also analyzed how obesity related to LFAT measured by 1H-MRS in 79 Finns and 118 Chinese with type 2 diabetes (T2D).The metabolic syndrome and T2D, fasting serum insulin, body mass index (BMI) and AST/ALT ratio were independent predictors of NAFLD in Chinese. The AUROC in the Chinese validation cohort was 0.76 (0.73-0.78) and in Finns 0.73 (0.68-0.78) (p<0.0001). 43%, 27%, 32% and 42% of Chinese had NAFLD when determined by the Chinese score, NAFLD liver fat score (p<0.001 vs. Chinese score), FLI (p<0.001) and HSI (NS). For any given BMI and waist circumference, the Chinese had a markedly higher LFAT than the Finns.The predictors of NAFLD in Han Chinese are as in Europids but the Chinese have more LFAT for any given degree of obesity than Europids. Ethnicity needs to be considered when NAFLD is predicted using risk scores."
https://openalex.org/W2516651960,"The recent establishment of a minimum age estimate of 39.9 ka for the origin of rock art in Sulawesi has challenged claims that Western Europe was the locus for the production of the world’s earliest art assemblages. Tantalising excavated evidence found across northern Australian suggests that Australia too contains a wealth of ancient art. However, the dating of rock art itself remains the greatest obstacle to be addressed if the significance of Australian assemblages are to be recognised on the world stage. A recent archaeological project in the northwest Kimberley trialled three dating techniques in order to establish chronological markers for the proposed, regional, relative stylistic sequence. Applications using optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) provided nine minimum age estimates for fossilised mudwasp nests overlying a range of rock art styles, while Accelerator Mass Spectrometry radiocarbon (AMS 14C) results provided an additional four. Results confirm that at least one phase of the northwest Kimberley rock art assemblage is Pleistocene in origin. A complete motif located on the ceiling of a rockshelter returned a minimum age estimate of 16 ± 1 ka. Further, our results demonstrate the inherent problems in relying solely on stylistic classifications to order rock art assemblages into temporal sequences. An earlier than expected minimum age estimate for one style and a maximum age estimate for another together illustrate that the Holocene Kimberley rock art sequence is likely to be far more complex than generally accepted with different styles produced contemporaneously well into the last few millennia. It is evident that reliance on techniques that produce minimum age estimates means that many more dating programs will need to be undertaken before the stylistic sequence can be securely dated."
https://openalex.org/W2514251649,"This article discusses the nature and structure of scientific collaboration as well as the association between academic collaboration networks and scientific productivity. Based on empirical data gathered from the CVs of 73 researchers affiliated with an academic research network in Canada, this study used social network analysis (SNA) to examine the association between researchers' structural position in the network and their scientific performance. With reference to Granovetter's and Burt's theories on weak ties and structural holes, we argue it is the bridging position a researcher holds in a scientific network that matters most to improve scientific performance. The results of correlation scores between network centrality and two different indicators of scientific performance indicate there is a robust association between researchers' structural position in collaboration networks and their scientific performance. We believe this finding, and the method we have developed, could have implications for the way research networks are managed and researchers are supported."
https://openalex.org/W2514307915,"Gli2 is the primary transcriptional activator of Hedgehog signalling in mammals. Upon stimulation of the pathway, Gli2 moves into the cilium before reaching the nucleus. However, the mechanisms underlying its entry into the cilium are not completely understood. Since several similarities have been reported between nuclear and ciliary import, we investigated if the nuclear import machinery participates in Gli2 ciliary entry. Here we show that while two conserved classical nuclear localization signals mediate Gli2 nuclear localization via importin (Imp)-α/β1, these sequences are not required for Gli2 ciliary import. However, blocking Imp-mediated transport through overexpression of GTP-locked Ran reduced the percentage of Gli2 positive cilia, an effect that was not explained by increased CRM1-dependent export of Gli2 from the cilium. We explored the participation of Imp-β2 in Gli2 ciliary traffic and observed that this transporter is involved in moving Gli2 into the cilium, as has been described for other ciliary proteins. In addition, our data indicate that Imp-β2 might also collaborate in Gli2 nuclear entry. How does Imp-β2 determine the final destination of a protein that can localize to two distinct subcellular compartments remains an open question. Therefore, our data shows that the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling machinery plays a critical role mediating the subcellular distribution of Gli2 and the activation of the pathway, but distinct importins likely play a differential role mediating its ciliary and nuclear translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2512078830,"The ALDH2 gene encodes the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), a critical enzyme involved in ethanol clearance through acetaldehyde metabolism. ALDH2 also catalyzes the metabolism of other bioreactive aldehydes, including propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, and 4-hydroxykenals (4-HNE). Increased levels of 4-HNE in adipose tissue positively correlate with obesity and insulin resistance. However, it remains unclear whether ALDH2 is involved in regulation of adipocyte differentiation. Here, we found that ALDH2 protein levels were lower in white adipose tissue of high-fat diet-fed mice and ob/ob mice relative to lean mice. Knockdown of ALDH2 expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes caused an increase in intracellular 4-HNE, thereby attenuated adipocyte differentiation. By contrast, an ALDH2 activator, Alda-1, significantly accelerated adipogenesis, which was accompanied by an increase in adipogenic gene expression. Consistently, adipogenesis was reduced when protein kinase C ε (PKCε), an ALDH2 phosphorylating activator, was silenced in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, whereas treatment with a PKCε agonist in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes enhanced adipogenesis. Whole-genome microarray profiling of Alda-1-treated cells demonstrated several upregulated transcripts encoding proteins involved in metabolism and the majority of these transcripts are for proteins involved in PPAR signaling pathways. Furthermore, PKCε-ALDH2 interaction alleviates 4-HNE induced aberrant PPARγ regulation on adipogenesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ALDH2 activation enhances adipogenesis and signaling pathways involving PPARγ. Thus, activation of PKCε-ALDH2 regulatory axis may be a therapeutic target for treating obesity and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2511664409,"Multidrug resistance to current Food and Drug Administration-approved HIV-1 protease (PR) inhibitors drives the need to understand the fundamental mechanisms of how drug pressure-selected mutations, which are oftentimes natural polymorphisms, elicit their effect on enzyme function and resistance. Here, the impacts of the hinge-region natural polymorphism at residue 35, glutamate to aspartate (E35D), alone and in conjunction with residue 57, arginine to lysine (R57K), are characterized with the goal of understanding how altered salt bridge interactions between the hinge and flap regions are associated with changes in structure, motional dynamics, conformational sampling, kinetic parameters, and inhibitor affinity. The combined results reveal that the single E35D substitution leads to diminished salt bridge interactions between residues 35 and 57 and gives rise to the stabilization of open-like conformational states with overall increased backbone dynamics. In HIV-1 PR constructs where sites 35 and 57 are both mutated (e.g. E35D and R57K), x-ray structures reveal an altered network of interactions that replace the salt bridge thus stabilizing the structural integrity between the flap and hinge regions. Despite the altered conformational sampling and dynamics when the salt bridge is disrupted, enzyme kinetic parameters and inhibition constants are similar to those obtained for subtype B PR. Results demonstrate that these hinge-region natural polymorphisms, which may arise as drug pressure secondary mutations, alter protein dynamics and the conformational landscape, which are important thermodynamic parameters to consider for development of inhibitors that target for non-subtype B PR."
https://openalex.org/W2512843223,"There is a popular belief that the lunar cycle influences spontaneous delivery in both humans and cattle. To assess this relationship, we investigated the synodic distribution of spontaneous deliveries in domestic Holstein cows. We used retrospective data from 428 spontaneous, full-term deliveries within a three-year period derived from the calving records of a private farm in Hokkaido, Japan. Spontaneous birth frequency increased uniformly from the new moon to the full moon phase and decreased until the waning crescent phase. There was a statistically significant peak between the waxing gibbous and full moon phases compared with those between the last quarter and the waning crescent. These changes were clearly observed in deliveries among multiparous cows, whereas they were not evident in deliveries among nulliparous cows. These data suggest the utility of dairy cows as models for bio-meteorological studies, and indicate that monitoring lunar phases may facilitate comprehensive understanding of parturition."

https://openalex.org/W2509563041,"Alterations have occurred and continue to manifest in the Earth's biota as a result of climate change. Animals exhibiting temperature dependent sex determination (TSD), including sea turtles, are perhaps most vulnerable to a warming of the Earth as highly skewed sex ratios can result, potentially leading to population extinction resulting from decreased male recruitment. Recent studies have begun to quantify climate change impacts to sea turtle populations, especially in terms of predicting effects on hatchling sex ratios. However, given the inherent difficulty in studying sex ratios at this life stage, a more accurate assessment of changes in population sex ratios might be derived by evaluating the juvenile portion of foraging aggregations. We investigated the long-term trend in sex ratio of a juvenile loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtle population inhabiting Pamlico and Core Sounds, North Carolina, USA. We used plasma testosterone reference ranges measured using radioimmunoassay (RIA) to assign sex for 959 turtles and confirmed sex assignment of a subset (N = 58) of the sampled turtles through laparoscopic examination of their gonads. Our results demonstrate that for this particular population of loggerheads, sex ratios (3Females:1Male) had not significantly changed over a 10 year period (1998-2007), nor showed any significant difference among 5-cm straight carapace length (SCL) size classes. Ultimately, these findings provide a basis for comparison with future sex ratios, and highlight the importance of establishing similar long-term studies monitoring secondary, rather than primary, sex ratios, so that needed mitigation measures to climate change impacts can be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2514437311,"Differentiation of chondrocytes towards hypertrophy is a natural process whose control is essential in endochondral bone formation. It is additionally thought to play a role in several pathophysiological processes, with osteoarthritis being a prominent example. We perform a dynamic analysis of a qualitative mathematical model of the regulatory network that directs this phenotypic switch to investigate the influence of the individual factors holistically. To estimate the stability of a SOX9 positive state (associated with resting/proliferation chondrocytes) versus a RUNX2 positive one (associated with hypertrophy) we employ two measures. The robustness of the state in canalisation (size of the attractor basin) is assessed by a Monte Carlo analysis and the sensitivity to perturbations is assessed by a perturbational analysis of the attractor. Through qualitative predictions, these measures allow for an in silico screening of the effect of the modelled factors on chondrocyte maintenance and hypertrophy. We show how discrepancies between experimental data and the model’s results can be resolved by evaluating the dynamic plausibility of alternative network topologies. The findings are further supported by a literature study of proposed therapeutic targets in the case of osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2515342495,"Sindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne bird virus that occasionally causes human disease in Fennoscandia, suggested to have cyclic 7-year intervals between outbreaks. Reliable data on human infections in Sweden is however lacking. Here we investigated the SINV antibody prevalence among birds in a Swedish area endemic to SINV to scrutinize if a cyclic variation in antibody prevalence is present in the natural host of SINV. Serum from birds were sampled in the summers of 2002–2004 and 2009 in the floodplains of the River Dalälven in central Sweden, with 2002 and 2009 representing hypothesized years of SINV outbreaks. A total of 963 birds from 52 species (mainly passerines) were tested for the presence of SINV antibodies using a plaque reduction neutralization test. The highest SINV antibody prevalence was found in Turdidae species, specifically Fieldfare, Redwing and Song thrush in which more than 70% of sampled individuals had antibodies to SINV in 2009. The SINV antibody prevalence significantly varied between years with 2% in 2002, 8% in 2003, 14% in 2004 and 37% in 2009. Antibodies were found equally often in hatchlings and in adults and increased from early to late in the season. Clearly, the SINV antibody prevalence was not elevated in the bird hosts in the predicted outbreak year 2002, thus solid evidence of a cyclic occurrence of SINV in Sweden is still lacking."
https://openalex.org/W2517035969,"Malignant gliomas are aggressive brain tumours with very poor prognosis. The majority of glioma cells are differentiated (glioma-differentiated cells: GDCs), whereas the smaller population (glioma-initiating cells, GICs) is undifferentiated and resistant to conventional therapies. Therefore, to better target this pool of heterogeneous cells, a combination of diverse therapeutic approaches is envisaged. Here we investigated whether the immunosensitising properties of the hypomethylating agent decitabine can be extended to GICs. Using the murine GL261 cell line, we demonstrate that decitabine augments the expression of the death receptor FAS both on GDCs and GICs. Interestingly, it had a higher impact on GICs and correlated with an enhanced sensitivity to FASL-mediated cell death. Moreover, the expression of other critical molecules involved in cognate recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, MHCI and ICAM-1, was upregulated by decitabine treatment. Consequently, T-cell mediated killing of both GDCs and GICs was enhanced, as was T cell proliferation after reactivation. Overall, although GICs are described to resist classical therapies, our study shows that hypomethylating agents have the potential to enhance glioma cell recognition and subsequent destruction by immune cells, regardless of their differentiation status. These results support the development of combinatorial treatment modalities including epigenetic modulation together with immunotherapy in order to treat heterogenous malignancies such as glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2512878224,"Objective This study was conducted to evaluate the outcomes of multi-channel switching RFA using a separable cluster electrode in patients with HCC. Methods From November 2011 to July 2013, 79 patients with 98 HCCs < 5 cm were enrolled and treated with RFA using a multi-channel switching radiofrequency system and a separable cluster electrode under the guidance of a real-time fusion imaging system. The primary and secondary endpoints were the 3-year local tumor progression (LTP) rate and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate, respectively. For post hoc analyses, LTP, RFS, and major complication rates were retrospectively compared with a historical control group treated with RFA using the same radiofrequency system but with multiple internally-cooled electrodes. Results The technique success rate of the 98 tumors was 100%. Cumulative 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year LTP rates were 3.4%, 6.9%, and 12.4%, respectively. For patient-level data, cumulative 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year RFS rates were 83.9%, 68.6%, and 45.4%, respectively. On post hoc analyses, none of the baseline characteristics showed a significant difference between the separable cluster electrode and multiple internally-cooled electrodes group. Cumulative LTP and RFS rates of the two groups also showed no significant difference (p = 0.401 and p = 0.881, respectively). Finally, major complication rates of the separable cluster electrode group (5.0%, 4/79) and multiple internally-cooled electrodes group (5.9%, 4/74) were also comparable (p = 1.000). Conclusion Switching monopolar RFA using a separable cluster electrode is a feasible and efficient technique for the treatment of HCCs smaller than 5 cm, providing comparable local tumor control to multiple internally-cooled electrodes.

https://openalex.org/W2952392117,"Hox homeodomain transcription factors are key regulators of animal development. They specify the identity of segments along the anterior-posterior body axis in metazoans by controlling the expression of diverse downstream targets, including transcription factors and signaling pathway components. The Drosophila melanogaster Hox factor Ultrabithorax (Ubx) directs the development of thoracic and abdominal segments and appendages, and loss of Ubx function can lead for example to the transformation of third thoracic segment appendages (e.g. halters) into second thoracic segment appendages (e.g. wings), resulting in a characteristic four-wing phenotype. Here we present a Drosophila melanogaster strain with a V5-epitope tagged Ubx allele, which we employed to obtain a high quality genome-wide map of Ubx binding sites using ChIP-seq. We confirm the sensitivity of the V5 ChIP-seq by recovering 7/8 of well-studied Ubx-dependent cis-regulatory regions. Moreover, we show that Ubx binding is predictive of enhancer activity as suggested by comparison with a genome-scale resource of in vivo tested enhancer candidates. We observed densely clustered Ubx binding sites at 12 extended genomic loci that included ANTP-C, BX-C, Polycomb complex genes, and other regulators and the clustered binding sites were frequently active enhancers. Furthermore, Ubx binding was detected at known Polycomb response elements (PREs) and was associated with significant enrichments of Pc and Pho ChIP signals in contrast to binding sites of other developmental TFs. Together, our results show that Ubx targets developmental regulators via strongly clustered binding sites and allow us to hypothesize that regulation by Ubx might involve Polycomb group proteins to maintain specific regulatory states in cooperative or mutually exclusive fashion, an attractive model that combines two groups of proteins with prominent gene regulatory roles during animal development."
https://openalex.org/W2516592648,"The knotweed taxa Fallopia japonica, F. sachalinensis and their interspecific hybrid F. × bohemica are some of the most aggressive invaders in Europe and North America and they are serious threats to native biodiversity. At the same time, they constitute a unique model system for the creation of hybrids and studies of the initiation of evolutionary processes. In the presented study, we focused on (i) examining genetic diversity in selected populations of three Fallopia taxa in the invaded (Poland) and native ranges (Japan), (ii) establishing genome size and ploidy levels and (iii) identifying ribosomal DNA (rDNA)-bearing chromosomes in all of the taxa from the invaded range. We found that the genetic diversity within particular taxa was generally low regardless of their geographical origin. A higher level of clonality was observed for the Polish populations compared to the Japanese populations. Our study suggests that the co-occurrence of F. sachalinensis together with the other two taxa in the same stand may be the source of the higher genetic variation within the F. × bohemica hybrid. Some shift towards the contribution of F. japonica alleles was also observed for selected F. × bohemica individuals, which indicates the possibility of producing more advanced generations of F. × bohemica hybrids. All of the F. sachalinensis individuals were hexaploid (2n = 6x = 66; 2C = 6.01 pg), while those of F. japonica were mostly octoploid (2n = 8x = 88; 2C = 8.87 pg) and all of the F. × bohemica plants except one were hexaploid (2n = 6x = 66; 2C = 6.46 pg). Within the chromosome complement of F. japonica, F. sachalinensis and F. × bohemica, the physical mapping of the rDNA loci provided markers for 16, 13 and 10 chromosomes, respectively. In F. × bohemica, a loss of some of rDNA loci was observed, which indicates the occurrence of genome changes in the hybrid."
https://openalex.org/W2510424199,"Blood flukes are among the most common disease causing pathogens infecting vertebrates, including humans and some of the world's most globally endangered fauna. Spirorchiid blood flukes are parasites of marine turtles, and are associated with pathology, strandings and mortalities worldwide. Their ova embolize in tissues and incite significant inflammatory responses, however attempts to draw correlations between species and lesions are frustrated by difficulties in identifying ova beyond the genus level. In this study, a newly developed terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) method was validated as a tool for differentiating between mixed spirorchiid ova in turtle tissue. Initially, a multiplex PCR was used to differentiate between the five genera of spirorchiid flukes. Following this, PCR was performed using genus/genera-specific fluorescently tagged primer pairs and PCR products digested analysis using restriction endonucleases. Using capillary electrophoresis, this T-RFLP method could differentiate between twelve species and genotypes of spirorchiid flukes in turtles. It was applied to 151 tissue samples and successfully identified the spirorchiid species present. It was found to be more sensitive than visual diagnosis, detecting infections in 28 of 32 tissues that were negative on histology. Spirorchiids were present in 96.7% of tissues tested, with Neospirorchis genotype 2 being the most prevalent, present in 93% of samples. Mixed infections were common, being present in 60.7% of samples tested. The method described here is, to our knowledge, the first use of the T-RFLP technique on host tissues or in an animal ecology context, and describes a significant advancement in the clinical capacity to diagnose a common cause of illness in our environment. It is proven as a sensitive, specific and cost-efficient means of identifying spirorchiid flukes and ova in turtles, with the potential to contribute valuable information to epidemiological and pathological studies as well as future diagnostics for this poorly understood disease."
https://openalex.org/W2512006943,"Human beings are inevitably exposed to ubiquitous phthalate esters (PAEs). Processed, packaged foods are popular nowadays, in which emulsifiers are frequently added as food additives. It is unclear how emulsifiers affect the bioavailability of ingested PAEs contaminants and their toxicities. The purposes of our study were to explore whether food emulsifier Glycerin Monostearate (GMS) could increase the internal exposure levels of six priority controlled PAEs and affect their reproductive toxicities when male rats are exposed to PAEs mixture (MIXPs). The male rats were exposed to MIXPs by gavage for thirty days in combination with or without given GMS. Phthalate monoesters (MPAEs), primary metabolites of PAEs, in rat urine were used as biomarkers to predict the internal exposure levels of the six PAEs, and their concentrations were determined using UPLC-MS. The reproductive toxicity was evaluated using serum testosterone levels test and histopathology of testes. Results showed that compared to PAEs exposure alone, the internal exposure levels of PAEs increased by 30%-49% in the presence of GMS. PAEs exposure led to the reduction of testosterone level by 23.4%-42.1% in the presence and absence of GMS, respectively, compared to the baseline. Testosterone levels in MIXPs+GMS and DEHP+GMS group were decreased by 9.1% and 13.6%, respectively, compared with MIXPs and DEHP group. Histopathology showed that injuries of testis (deciduous spermatids) were observed, and GMS exacerbated the injuries. The results indicated food emulsifiers chronically taken up might increase safety risks of food PAEs contaminants."

What does Phe-109 contribute to the structure and function of SRY, and why does Swyer mutation F109S SRY lead to variable male or female somatic phenotypes? To address these questions, our investigation had two parts. We first undertook biochemical and biophysical studies of the variant HMG box. These experiments demonstrated that the mutation is profoundly destabilizing, and yet its specific DNA-binding and DNA-bending properties are similar to those of the WT SRY domain. We next pursued cell biological studies of the WT and variant SRY (as epitope-tagged intact proteins introduced by transient transfection) in diverse rat and human cell lines. The latter studies employed two rodent and two human cell lines differing in tissue of origin and state of differentiation. Whereas all four lines share the universal ubiquitin-dependent (26S) and default (20S) proteasomal pathway of protein degradation (41.Kirschner M.

This ras-immortalized pre-Sertoli cell line (designated CH34 (44.Haqq C.M. King C.Y. Ukiyama E. Falsafi S. Haqq T.N. Donahoe P.K. Weiss M.A. Molecular basis of mammalian sexual determination: activation of Müllerian inhibiting substance gene expression by SRY.Science. 1994; 266: 1494-1500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) thus provides a model of the site and stage of endogenous Sry expression (13.Phillips N.B.

A control rat XY cell line (CH15) lacking pre-Sertoli markers (and unresponsive to transfected SRY) was also obtained from the embryonic bipotential ridge and presumably represents a non-Sertoli-related lineage (46.Haqq C.M. Donahoe P.K. Regulation of sexual dimorphism in mammals.Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The two SRY-unresponsive human cell lines (HEK 293T and Hs1.TES) were respectively derived from the embryonic kidney (47.Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. Characteristics of a human cell line transformed by DNA from human adenovirus type 5.J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and fetal testis (Leydig cell lineage (48.Zhang L. Ding X. Nie S. Li-Ling J. Zhang Y. Zhang H. Chen L. Li L. Ding M. Association of hsa-miR-145 overexpression in human testicular cells with male infertility.Mol. Med. Rep. 2015; 11: 4365-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar)). Remarkably, F109S SRY underwent, irrespective of particular cellular context, enhanced polyubiquitination and accelerated proteasomal degradation, reducing the mean intracellular SRY concentration at a given level of transfected mRNA expression. In contrast, no significant changes were obtained in the in vitro susceptibility of the variant domain to degradation by the 20S core proteasome. In SRY-responsive CH34 cells, accelerated ubiquitin-associated degradation led to decreased occupancy of a target enhancer element (the testis-specific enhancer of Sox9 (TES) (49.Sekido R. Lovell-Badge R. Sex determination involves synergistic action of SRY and SF1 on a specific Sox9 enhancer.Nature. 2008; 453: 930-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar)) and in turn with attenuated transcriptional activation of this, the principal endogenous target gene in the program of testicular differentiation (red box in Fig. 1A) (14.Chen Y.S. Racca J.D. Phillips N.B. Weiss M.A. Inherited human sex reversal due to impaired nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of SRY defines a male transcriptional threshold.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sex determination involves synergistic action of SRY and SF1 on a specific Sox9 enhancer.Nature. 2008; 453: 930-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with chemical proteasome inhibitor MG132 equalized expression of WT and F109S SRY, leading in turn to a striking restoration of native TES enhancer occupancy and rescue of native Sox9 expression. Such subtle effects of the F109S substitution on the structure and function of SRY are in general accordance with past studies of inherited Swyer mutations unrelated in their respective molecular mechanisms of perturbation (13.Phillips N.B.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: E3567-E3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that a conserved aromatic residue at the back surface of a specific HMG box functions to seal the hydrophobic core and thereby enhances thermodynamic stability and cellular lifetime. F109S and WT SRY differ in efficiency as substrates for polyubiquitination and therefore in proteasomal turnover but exhibit, on a per molecule basis, similar gene-regulatory properties. Together, these findings and their clinical correlation highlight enhanced ubiquitination and accelerated degradation of a master transcription factor as a molecular mechanism of impaired human sex determination. To our knowledge, this is the first observation in a metazoan that such a proteasome-based mechanism may impair the robustness of organogenesis leading to phenotypic variation within a family tree. Thermal stabilities of the free WT and variant domains were assessed by circular dichroism (CD) (Fig. 2, A and B). The unfolding transition of the variant domain (red in Fig. 2A) was shifted toward lower temperatures (relative to WT) in the range 20–40 °C (black). Estimates of midpoint temperatures were as follows: (variant) 28(±0.5)°C versus (WT) 41(±0.5)°C (vertical arrows in derivative plots, Fig. 2B, and Table 1). Reduced thermal stability was associated with increased Trp fluorescence emission at both 15 and 37 °C (respective filled and open circles in Fig. 2C), suggesting that the core of the variant domain is less stably packed and so more exposed to solvent water. These emission spectra contain contributions from two conserved Trp residues in the core of the major wing (Trp-70 and Trp-98; box positions 15 and 43 as shown in green in Fig. 3E) and an additional non-conserved Trp on the protein surface (Trp-107; box position 53). The similar emission intensities at the two temperatures is likely to reflect offsetting effects of thermal unfolding (enhancing the fluorescence of core Trp side chains) and solvent quenching (more effective at the higher temperature).TABLE 1Biophysical and biochemical characterization of WT and variant SRY4 °C25 °CDomainCmidaTwo-state model parameters: ΔGu (kcal/mol), Cmid (M), and m (kcal mol−1 m−1); errors are for each sample ±0.1 kcal/mol (ΔGu), ±0.1 m (Cmid), and ±0.03 kcal mol−1 m−1 (m).maTwo-state model parameters: ΔGu (kcal/mol), Cmid (M), and m (kcal mol−1 m−1); errors are for each sample ±0.1 kcal/mol (ΔGu), ±0.1 m (Cmid), and ±0.03 kcal mol−1 m−1 (m).,bThe m-value (slope d(ΔG)/d(M)) correlates with extent of hydrophobic surfaces exposed on denaturation.ΔGuaTwo-state model parameters: ΔGu (kcal/mol), Cmid (M), and m (kcal mol−1 m−1); errors are for each sample ±0.1 kcal/mol (ΔGu"

Tumor cell killing was achieved by concerted action of necrosis/apoptosis induction, ATP depletion, and inhibition of glycolytic and para-glycolytic enzymes. Ethyl lactate was less harmful to leukemia cells but was found to arrest cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase. Both, ethyl pyruvate and ethyl lactate were identified as new inhibitors of GSK-3β. Despite the strong effect of ethyl pyruvate on leukemia cells, human cognate blood cells were only marginally affected.

Our results inform new mechanisms of ethyl pyruvate-induced cell death, offering thereby a new treatment regime with a high therapeutic window for leukemic tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2514645721,"Background In Vietnam, an estimated 256,000 people are living with HIV, and 58% of HIV-infections reported are among people who inject drugs (PWID). While antiretroviral therapy (ART) is widely available in Vietnam, marginalized hard-to-reach male PWID, demonstrate significantly reduced and delayed access to ART. Methods We investigated the effect of a randomized four-arm multi-level intervention trial on ART initiation among male PWID. Our analysis was conducted among a subset of trial participants (n = 136), who were newly diagnosed as HIV-infected, treatment naïve, and eligible for ART (baseline late diagnosis). The trial arms included: 1, standard of care (HIV testing and counseling); 2, structural-level intervention (door-to-door communications and community video screenings); 3, individual-level intervention (counseling plus group support); and 4, individual-level plus structural-level intervention. In a time-to-event analysis, we used a non-parametric approach for competing risks to estimate cumulative incidence function (CIF) for ART initiation (event of interest) by arm and the difference in CIF for each trial arm as compared to Arm 1. Follow-up was conducted at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Data collection occurred from 2009 to 2013. Findings By 24-months, 61.0% initiated ART, and 30.9% had died prior to ART initiation. In the first 6 months, participants in arm 4 (individual plus community intervention) had a 28% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6–50%) increased probability of initiating ART. Despite increasing coverage of ART in all arms throughout follow-up, participants in arm 4 retained a 31% (95% CI: 5–56%) increased probability of initiating ART. The individual and community components of the intervention were only effective when delivered together. Conclusions Marginalized, hard-to-reach men, who do not routinely engage in HIV services, and therefore come into care late, may benefit significantly from both individual counseling and group support, in combination with community-focused stigma reduction, when being referred and attempting to initiate urgently needed ART."

To identify the processes involved in cadmium detoxification, we constructed a cDNA library of tobacco roots acclimated to cadmium (Cd) stress. According to the results of functional screening cDNA library with a yeast Cd-sensitive mutant, ycf1Δ, we obtained a series of candidate genes that were involved in Cd response. Sequence analysis and yeast functional complementation of 24 positive cDNA clones revealed that, in addition to antioxidant genes, genes implicated in abiotic and biotic stress defenses, cellular metabolism, and signal transduction showed Cd detoxification effects in yeast. The real time RT-PCR analyses revealed that some Cd tolerance/ detoxification genes may be able to anticipate in other stresses such as biotic defense and water balance in tobacco. Taken together, our data suggest that plants' acclimation to Cd stress is a highly complex process associated with broad gene functions. Moreover, our results provide insights into the Cd detoxification mechanisms along with the antioxidant system, defense gene induction, and calcium signal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2509740995,"Internal fertilization ensures successful reproduction of tetrapod vertebrates on land, although how this mode of reproduction evolved is unknown. Here, we identified a novel gene encoding sperm motility-initiating substance (SMIS), a key protein for the internal fertilization of the urodele Cynops pyrrhogaster by Edman degradation of an isolated protein and subsequent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The SMIS gene encoded a 150 amino-acid sequence including the cysteine knot (CK) motif. No gene with substantial similarity to the SMIS was in the data bank of any model organisms. An active site of the SMIS was in the C-terminal region of the 2nd loop of CK motif. A synthetic peptide including the active site sequence bound to the midpiece and initiated/enhanced the circular motion of C. pyrrhogaster sperm, which allows penetration of the egg jelly specialized for the internal fertilization of this species. The synthetic peptide bound to whole sperm of Rhacophorus arboreus and enhanced the rotary motion, which is adapted to propel the sperm through egg coat matrix specialized for arboreal reproduction, while it bound to the tip of head and tail of Bufo japonicus sperm, and enhanced the vibratory motion, which is suited to sperm penetration through the egg jelly specialized for the reproduction of that species in freshwater. The polyclonal antibody against the active site of the SMIS specifically bound to egg coat matrix of R. arboreus. These findings suggest that diversification of amphibian reproductive modes accompanies the specialization of egg coat and the adaptation of sperm motility to penetrate the specialized egg coat, and SMIS acts as the sperm motility enhancer of anurans and urodeles that might facilitate to adaptively optimize sperm motility for allowing the establishment of internal fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W2515246221,"Resistance to anti-malarials is a major challenge for effective malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa. This triggered a need for routine monitoring of the efficacy of the antimalarial drugs every two years in all malaria endemic countries. Chloroquine remained the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Though, a strong scientific evidence of chloroquine resistance to P.vivax that could have brought change of treatment regimen is yet to be established in Ethiopia, continuous and regular monitoring of drug's efficacy is critical for establishing rational anti-malarial drug policies. This study therefore, assessed the therapeutic efficacy of Chloroquine (CQ) for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infections in Northwestern Ethiopia.An observational, 28- day therapeutic clinical efficacy study was conducted from August to December, 2014, in Northwest Ethiopia. Patients confirmed to have monoinfection of vivax malaria, aged above 6 months were included. All subjects were treated with standard chloroquine dose of 25 mg/kg for three (3) days. Parasitological and clinical outcomes of treated patients were then evaluated on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 during the entire 28-day follow-up period. A portable spectrophotometer (HemoCue Hb 301 System, Sweden) was used to estimate hemoglobin concentration.A total of 69 subjects had completed follow up. Some 57/69 (82.6%) had fever at enrolment and the rest 12 patients 48 hours before enrollment. Out of total, 65/69 (94.2%) and 66/69 (95.6%) of the study subjects were free of fever by day 1 and day 2 respectively but fever was cleared in all subjects by day 3. At base line the mean asexual parasitemia was 3540 parasites/μL of blood. Parasite carriage on day 3 was 3%. The overall cure rate (an adequate and clinical parasitological response) was very high (97%) [(95% CI = 93.1-99.4)]. The time to parasite, fever and gametocyte clearance as expressed in mean (SD) was 35 (3), 25 (4.6), 28 (3.2) hours respectively. Mean hemoglobin was significantly increased (P<0.001) from 12.2 (7-15) g/dl at day 0 to 13.3 (10-16) g/dl on day 28.In view of our findings, CQ remains efficacious for the treatment of vivax malaria in the study area. However, there is a need to monitor CQR regularly using molecular and or biochemical tools for better evaluation of treatment outcomes."

Our results revealed that β2-GPI dose-dependently decreased the VEGF-induced increase in endothelial cell proliferation, using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assays. Furthermore, incubation with both β2-GPI and deglycosylated β2-GPI inhibited the VEGF-induced tube formation. Our results suggest that the carbohydrate residues of β2-GPI do not participate in the function of anti-angiogenesis. Using in vivo Matrigel plug and angioreactor assays, we show that β2-GPI remarkably inhibited the VEGF-induced angiogenesis at a physiological concentration. Moreover, β2-GPI inhibited the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), Akt, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In summary, our in vitro and in vivo data reveal for the first time that β2-GPI inhibits the VEGF-induced angiogenesis and highlights the potential for β2-GPI in anti-angiogenic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2509621277,"The present study was aimed at assessing the characteristics of children with nosocomial multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii complex (MDR ABC) in a tertiary hospital of eastern China. MDR ABC poses a serious threat to public health. However, information on nosocomial MDR ABC in children is lacking.This study retrospectively reviewed the cases in a tertiary hospital of eastern China between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2014 (excluding outpatients).A total of 377 non-duplicated nosocomial ABC isolates were collected from various samples including 200 (53.1%) MDR ABC isolates. Moreover, 158 of the 200 MDR ABC isolates were collected from intensive care units (ICUs; MDR constituent ratios, 62.5%), while 98 of the 200 MDR ABC isolates were collected from children older than 1 year (MDR constituent ratios, 62.8%). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that being in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), prolonged hospital stay, surgical intervention, and mechanical ventilation were independent risk factors for MDR acquisition among children with nosocomial ABC. The interleukin (IL)-6 level of children with nosocomial MDR ABC was significantly lower than that of the children with nosocomial non-MDR ABC.Nosocomial MDR ABC infection is a serious concern in pediatric patients. Being in the SICU, prolonged hospital stay, surgical intervention, and mechanical ventilation increased the risk of nosocomial MDR ABC. IL-6 might be involved in developing nosocomial MDR ABC among children."
https://openalex.org/W2517627147,"In social animals, kin relations strongly shape the social structure of a group. In female-bonded species, maternal relatedness is likely to be mediated via familiarity, but evidence is accumulating that non-human primates are able to recognize kin that they are not familiar with and adjust their behavior accordingly. In playback experiments, female rhesus macaques showed increased interest in ‘coo’ calls produced by unfamiliar paternal half-sisters compared to ‘coo’ calls produced by unfamiliar unrelated females, suggesting that these calls should have some common structural characteristics that facilitate the discrimination of kin from non-kin. Here we analyzed ‘coo’ calls of 67 adult female rhesus macaques from four groups and seven matrilines living on the island of Cayo Santiago (Puerto Rico). We tested whether the call structure of closely maternal and/or paternal related females, as determined from extensive pedigree data, differed from the call structure of unrelated females, while controlling for familiarity (i.e., group-matrilineal membership and age difference) of subjects. In contrast to our expectation, kinship did not predict similarities in ‘coo’ call structure, whereas ‘coo’ structure was more similar when produced by females of similar age as well as by females with higher familiarity, suggesting that experience is more decisive than genetic background. The high number of individuals in the analysis and the high accuracy of the assignment of calls to individuals render a lack of power as an unlikely explanation. Thus, based on the results of this study, kin recognition in rhesus monkeys does neither appear to be based on the assessment of self-similarity, nor on the comparison among related subjects (i.e., acoustic phenotype matching), but appears to be mediated by different or multiple cues. Furthermore, the results support the notion that frequent social interactions result in increasing acoustic similarity within largely innate call types (‘vocal accommodation’)."
https://openalex.org/W2509356155,"Phage display was used to identify peptide mimics of an immunologically protective nematode glycan (CarLA) by screening a constrained C7C peptide library for ligands that bound to an anti-CarLA mAb (PAB1). Characterisation of these peptide mimotopes revealed functional similarities with an epitope that is defined by PAB1. Mimotope vaccinations of mice with three selected individual phage clones facilitated the induction of antibody responses that recognised the purified, native CarLA molecule which was obtained from Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Furthermore, these mimotopes are specifically recognised by antibodies in the saliva of animals that were immune to natural polygeneric nematode challenge. This shows that antibodies to the PAB1 epitope form part of the mucosal polyclonal anti-CarLA antibody response of nematode immune host animals. This demonstrates that the selected peptide mimotopes are of biological relevance. These peptides are the first to mimic the PAB1 epitope of CarLA, a defined larval glycan epitope which is conserved between many nematode species."
https://openalex.org/W2515412105,"A new species of Primulaceae, Primula undulifolia, is described from the hilly area of Hunan province in south-central China. Its morphology and distributional range suggest that it is allied to P. kwangtungensis, both adapted to subtropical climate, having contiguous distribution and similar habitat, growing on shady and moist cliffs. Petioles, scapes and pedicels of them are densely covered with rusty multicellular hairs, but the new species can be easily distinguished by its smaller flowers and narrowly oblong leaves with undulate margins. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on four DNA markers (ITS, matK, trnL-F and rps16) confirmed the new species as an independent lineage and constitutes a main clade together with P. kwangtungensis, P. kweichouensis, P. wangii and P. hunanensis of Primula sect. Carolinella."
https://openalex.org/W2515516989,"Recent studies have shown that a large proportion of patients classified as essential thrombocythemia (ET) actually have early primary prefibrotic myelofibrosis (prePMF), which implies an inferior prognosis as compared to patients being diagnosed with so-called genuine or true ET. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 classification, bone marrow histology is a major component in the distinction between these disease entities. However, the differential diagnosis between them may be challenging and several studies have not been able to distinguish between them. Most lately, it has been argued that simple blood tests, including the leukocyte count and plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be useful tools to separate genuine ET from prePMF, the latter disease entity more often being featured by anemia, leukocytosis and elevated LDH. Whole blood gene expression profiling was performed in 17 and 9 patients diagnosed with ET and PMF, respectively. Using elevated LDH obtained at the time of diagnosis as a marker of prePMF, a 7-gene signature was identified which correctly predicted the prePMF group with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 89%. The 7 genes included MPO, CEACAM8, CRISP3, MS4A3, CEACAM6, HEMGN, and MMP8, which are genes known to be involved in inflammation, cell adhesion, differentiation and proliferation. Evaluation of bone marrow biopsies and the 7-gene signature showed a concordance rate of 71%, 79%, 62%, and 38%. Our 7-gene signature may be a useful tool to differentiate between genuine ET and prePMF but needs to be validated in a larger cohort of “ET” patients."
https://openalex.org/W2515967112,"The effectiveness of health interventions can be impaired by low socio-economic status and poor living conditions of the target population. However, the specifics of this problem in rural China are still unclear, and appropriate strategies should be explored.In 2013, we conducted a questionnaire-based investigation among 410 participants from a population-based esophageal cancer cohort study in rural Anyang, China. Information regarding their demographic characteristics, levels of exposure to four health-risk behaviors, including smoking, alcohol consumption, risky dietary behaviors and poor hygiene, as well as willingness to change these behaviors, and data on potential predictors of willingness to change behaviors were collected.In this study, 33.3% (23/69), 25.0% (13/52), 60.7% (68/112) and 62.2% (237/381) of respondents reported that they were willing to change smoking, alcohol consumption, risky dietary behaviors and poor hygiene, respectively. Older people had higher exposure levels and less willingness to change these four health-risk behaviors. The levels of these four health-risk behaviors were negatively associated with willingness to change, while faith in people and behavioral change in surrounding people increased willingness to change risky behaviors.In behavior-intervention-based health-promotion programs in rural China, the elderly and highly exposed populations should be the most difficult part and community- or household-based intervention would be more efficient."
