https://openalex.org/W1533336413,"The membrane-bound formate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate was solubilized with deoxycholate and purified to near homogeneity. The purification procedure included ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatography on Bio-Gel A-1.5m and DEAE Bio-Gel A in the presence of the nonionic detergent, Triton X-100. This detergent caused a significant decrease in the molecular weight of the soluble formate dehydrogenase complex and allowed the enzyme then to be resolved from other membrane components. Anaerobic conditions were required throughout due to the sensitivity of the enzyme to oxygen inactivation. Formate dehydrogenase was judged to be at least 93 to 99% pure by the following procedures: polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of Triton X-100 and sodium dodecyl sulfate, gel filtration, and sedimentation velocity studies. The purified enzyme exists as a detergent-protein complex (0.20 +/- 0.03 g of Triton X-100/g of protein) which has an S20,w of 18.1 S and a Stokes radius of 76 A. This corresponds to a molecular weight of 590,000 +/- 59,000. The enzyme had an absorbance spectrum of a b-type cytochrome which could be completely reduced by formate. The heme content corresponds to an equivalent weight of 154,000 which suggests a tetrameric structure for the enzyme. Formate dehydrogenase was found to contain (in relative molar amounts): 1.0 heme, 0.95 molybdenum, 0.96 selenium, 14 non-heme iron, and 13 acid-labile sulfide. Neither FAD nor FMN could be detected. The enzyme contains three polypeptides, designated alpha, beta, and gamma, whose molecular weights were estimated by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate to be 110,000, 32,000, and 20,000, respectively. After separation of the polypeptides by gel filtration in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate alpha, beta, and gamma were found in 1:1.2:0.55 molar ratios. A study of the enzyme obtained from cells grown with [75Se]selenite showed that only the alpha polypeptide contained significant amounts of selenium. The enzyme will catalyze the formate-dependent reduction of phenazine methosulfate, dichlorophenolindophenol, methylene blue, nitroblue tetrazolium, benzyl viologen, methyl viologen, ferricyanide, and coenzyme Q6. Cyanide, azide, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, iodoacetamide, and oxygen inhibit the enzyme. The procedure which was designed for the purification of formate dehydrogenase also yields a highly purified preparation of nitrate reductase. This nitrate reductase has been shown to contain significant amounts of heme (Enoch, H. G., and Lester, R. L. (1974) Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 61,1234-1241). The enzyme contains three polypeptides with molecular weights of 155,000, 63,000, and 19,000. When measured in the presence of Trition X-100 the Stokes radius of nitrate reductase is 75 A and the S20,w is 16 S which corresponds to a molecular weight of 498,000."

https://openalex.org/W1482501584,"The protein responsible for the initiation of conversion of single-stranded phage G4 DNA to the duplex replicative form has been purified approximately 3000-fold and identified with Escherichia coli dnaG gene product. The protein is a rifampicin-resistant RNA polymerase of approximately 64,000 daltons. It catalyzes the incorporation of the four ribonucleoside triphosphates into an oligoribonucleotide, using as template the single-stranded DNA coated with the DNA unwinding protein of E. coli. An RNA transcript of a unique region of the chromosome can serve as a primer by covalent extension by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme to form a nearly full-length linear complementary strand. A similar role for the dnaG protein in the initiation of nascent (Okazaki) fragments in replication of the host chromosome is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1527606153,"The 30 S ribosomal precursor RNA has been prepared from Escherichia coli AB301/105 (RNase III-) labeled with 32-PO4 in the presence of chloramphenicol. Direct nucleotide sequence studies yield the following information. 1. The major 5'-terminal sequence in our precursor preparations is pppA-C-U-G-. 2. Treatment of the precursor RNA with purified ribonuclease III in vitro releases species sedimenting near 23 S and 17 S, neither of which retain the pppA- end, plus a collection of small fragments with chain lengths of less than 400 nucleotides. 3. The RNase III product sedimenting near 17 S (16 SIII) appears identical with the 17 S RNA typically isolated from pulse-labeled or chloramphenicol-treated cells or from several mutants deficient in ribosome assembly: fingerprint analysis reveals the presence of the same additional RNase T1 oligonucleotides and the 5' terminus (pU-G-) previously described for 17 S RNA. A 3'-terminal T1 oligonucleotide (which was not previously identifiable in the case of the 17 S precursor) has been isolated from 16 S III and its sequence determined: C-U-C-A-C-A-C-A. 4. 5 S rRNA sequences are contained in an RNase III-released fragment of approximately 300 nucleotides. This molecule lacks the 5' terminus of the mature 5 S RNA. The implications of these findings with respect to the control of ribosomal RNA synthesis, the pathways of rRNA processing in vivo, and the specificity of RNase III cleavage of natural substrates are discussed."

Assays depended on: (a) complementation of extracts of thermosensitive mutants and (b) fractionation of extracts of wild type cells to divide essential components into groups, each of which was further resolved. These procedures have yielded eight proteins: dnaB protein, dnaC protein, proteins i and n (two novel proteins without a defined genetic locus), dnaG protein, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (polymerase III and copolymerase III), and DNA unwinding protein; purification procedures for the first four are presented here.

https://openalex.org/W1506645419,"The complete amino acid sequence of porcine pepsin (EC 3.4.4.1) was constructed from the sequence of five cyanogen bromide fragments. The sequence of one of these fragments, CB2A, is reported here. The sequences of 4 other fragments are known from previous work. Porcine pepsin contains 327 residues with three structural variants. The active center aspartyl residue, which reacts with 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane (Chen, K. C. S., and Tang, J. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 2566-2574), is located at residue 32. Another active site aspartyl residue, which reacts with diazo inactivators (Bayliss, R. S., Knowles, J. B., and Wybrandt, G. B. (1969) Biochem. J. 113, 377-386, IS LOCATED AT RESIDUE 215. The sequences around these 2 aspartyl residues are apparently homologous to each other. The sequences around the tryptophanyl residues at positions 39, 141, 181, and 300 are also homologous to one another. These homologous sequences could be genetic in origin. Fragment CB2A which contains 119 residues was constructed from the peptide sequences resulting from six proteolytic digestions and chemical cleavage at tryptophanyl bonds."

https://openalex.org/W1549012190,"The interaction of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (ribonucleoside triphosphate:RNA nucleotidyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.6.) with chick oviduct DNA and chromatin has been studied in order to quantify the RNA polymerase binding sites and rifampicin-resistant initiation sites. The number of high affinity binding sites at saturation was calculated from the number of molecules of enzyme bound to DNA or to chromatin. The number of rifampicin-resistant initiation sites was calculated from the total quantity and the number average chain length of RNA synthesized under the conditions in which only RNA polymerase already in a stable preinitiation complex could avoid inhibition by the drug. Using an assessment of the temperature requirement for the information of this preinitiation complex, we were able to differentiate initiations at single-stranded or nicked DNA regions from initiations at double-stranded DNA regions. This method enabled us to rule out the possibility that RNA chain initiation on chromatin was due to initiation at nicked or end regions of DNA. In addition, we also demonstrated that not all RNA polymerase molecules bound to DNA or chromatin are located at a site at which RNA chain initiation can immediately begin. This methodological approach should allow investigators to monitor the individual reactions and factors involved in in vitro transcription of eukaryotic DNA and chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W1542121655,"Estrogen administration to chicks results in an increase in the chromatin template activity of oviduct target tissue as assayed under standard in vitro assay conditions. However, the results obtained by the simple measurement of template activity may be a complicated function of the number of available RNA polymerase initiation sites, the rate of RNA chain elongation, and the rate of reinitiation. In the present study, we have measured separately the change in both the number of chain initiations as well as the rate of RNA chain propagation under conditions in which reinitiation was eliminated. Chromatin prepared from either estrogen-treated or control oviducts both supported an RNA chain elongation rate of six nucleotides per s and a chain size of approximately 700 nucleotides. Thus, both the elongation rate and size of the average product remained relatively constant following estrogen stimulation. In contrast, within 8 hours after a single injection of estrogen to unstimulated chicks, the concentration of RNA polymerase needed to saturate chromatin binding sites was increased to 150% in comparison to control values, and by 24 hours the level of polymerase bound to chromatin was twice that of the untreated control chick chromatin. With daily injections of estrogen, polymerase binding continued to rise. Coincident with the over-all increase in chromatin-bound polymerase was an increase in rifampicin-insensitive initiation sites and newly synthesized RNA chains. Unstimulated chick oviduct chromatin initiated 10,000 RNA chains/pg of DNA, while 24 hours of steroid treatment increased the number of initiated chains to 34,000 chains. These data demonstrate that the estrogen-induced increase in chromatin transcriptive activity was due to an increased number of polymerase binding and initiation sites on the chromatin template without a detectable change in the rate of RNA chain elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1977309025,"Mitochondrial DNA replication was examined in mutants for seven different Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes which are essential for nuclear DNA replication. In cdc8 and cdc21, mutants defective in continued replication during the S phase of the cell cycle, mitochondrial DNA replication ceases at the nonpermissive temperature. Replication is temperature sensitive even when these mutants are arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with alpha factor, a condition where mitochondrial DNA replication continues for the equivalent of several generations at the permissive temperature. Therefore the cessation of replication results from a defect in mitochondrial replication per se, rather than from an indirect consequence of cells being blocked in a phase of the cell cycle where mitochondrial DNA is not normally synthesized. Since the temperature-sensitive mutations are recessive, the products of genes cdc8 and cdc21 must be required for both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication. In contrast to cdc8 and cdc21, mitochondrial DNA replication continues for a long time at the nonpermissive temperature in five other cell division cycle mutants in which nuclear DNA synthesis ceases within one cell cycle: cdc4, cdc7, and cdc28, which are defective in the initiation of nuclear DNA synthesis, and cdc14 and cdc23, which are defective in nuclear division. The products of these genes, therefore, are apparently not required for the initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1978052070,"The conversion of precursor RNA into bacteriophage T4 proline and serine transfer RNAs includes two steps for the enzymatic removal of nucleotides from the 3′ ends of RNA chains. Neither of these steps occur following infection of a mutant of Escherichia coli that was previously shown to block the suppressor function of T4 serine transfer RNA. Cell-free extracts of this mutant are furthermore deficient in a wild type enzyme activity that removes nucleotides from the 3′ ends of one of the RNA chains described above. The relation of this enzyme to other 3′ ribonucleases is not known. We subsequently examined the mutant for its ability to support the biosynthesis of other bacteriophage transfer RNAs. In one instance that is analogous to the proline-serine precursor RNA, maturation of the precursor RNA was blocked during infection of mutant cells. In another instance, precursor RNA maturation was normal, even though this involved the removal of 3′ nucleotides. These observations point to the possible existence of at least two 3′ ribonucleases for the biosynthesis of transfer RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1579065337,"Glycerol starvation of an Escherichia coli glycerol auxotroph results in a specific inhibition of membrane phospholipid synthesis. Mindich ((1972) J. Bacteriol. 110, 96-102) observed only a trace accumulation of free fatty acid following glycerol deprivation. We have repeated these experiments using glycerol auxotrophs which also possess a lesion in beta oxidation. This defect was introduced in order to control fatty acid degradation. In contrast to the previous results, we find free fatty acid does accumulate during glycerol starvation. Similar results were found using beta oxidation-defective (fadE-) derivatives of both gpsA and plsB glycerol auxotrophs. Upon glycerol starvation of a plsB- fadE- strain, phospholipid synthesis is 90 percent inhibited. Following a lag of 20 to 40 min, free fatty acid synthesis begins and proceeds at a rate that steadily increases until the rate of fatty acid synthesis is equal to that found in glycerol-supplemented cultures. The accumulation of free fatty acid is the result of de novo synthesis. The average chain length of the fatty acid in the unesterified fraction is abnormally long. Two 20-carbon fatty acids, cis-13-eicosenoic acid and arachidic acid, are found in this frction. Furthermore, a greatly increased level of stearic acid and a small amount of a C-22 (behenic) acid are found in the free fatty acid fraction. These data indicate that acyl transfer into phospholipid is a major determinant of phospholipid acyl moiety chain length. Other experiments have shown that the free fatty acid fraction in glycerol-starved cells is metabolically active. This fraction turns over despite the defective beta oxidation system. Restoration of glycerol to starved cells allows the incorporation of the unesterified fatty acids into phospholipid."
https://openalex.org/W2088120338,"Previous work with bacteria has shown that a gene is maximally sensitive to mutagenesis by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NG) at the time it is being replicated. NG was used to test for temporal order in the replication of the genome of the unicellular eucaryote, Saccaromyces cerevisiae. Yeast cells growing exponentially were more sensitive to mutagenesis by NG than cells in which DNA synthesis had been inhibited. Further, in a synchronized population of cells, individual genetic markers exhibited maximum sensitivity to muta-genesis at distinct limited intervals within the DNA synthesis period. The peaks of sensitivity are interpreted as reflecting the times of replication of different genes. Since markers for five genes on four different chromosomes showed discrete periods of maximum sensitivity, it is likely that temporal ordering of replication exists for most genes in the yeast genome. These results imply that sites for initiation of DNA replication occur at fairly specific regions along yeast chromosomal DNA moleucles, and are activated at predetermined times in the DNA synthesis period."
https://openalex.org/W1484197122,"The response of the Escherichia coli sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase to guanosine 5-diphosphate-3-diphosphate (ppGpp) has been determined in vitro employing palmityl coenzyme A (CoA) and palmityl acyl carrier protein as acyl substrates. Levels of ppGpp which cause significant inhibition of enzyme activity with palmityl-CoA as substrate have no effect on enzyme activity when palmityl acyl carrier protein is employed as acyl donor. The inhibition of enzyme activity observed with palmityl-CoA as acyl substrate was dependent upon the relative concentrations of MgCl2 and ppGpp (MgCl2 to ppGpp ratio) employed. With palmityl-CoA as acyl donor, PPGpp inhibited the production of lysophosphatidic acid but not phosphatidic acid. With palmityl acyl carrier protein as acyl substrate, ppGpp had no influence upon the distribution of the reaction products."
https://openalex.org/W1562110470,"Previously reported experiments (Winand, R.J., and Kohn, L.D. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 967-975; Kohn, L.D., and Winand, R.J. (1971) J. Biol. Chem 246, 6570-6575) have demonstrated that partial pepsin digestion of bovine thyrotropin preparation yields a fragment of the thyrotropin molecule which is exophthalmogenic but has negligible or no thyroid-stimulating activity. In the present report this exophthalmogenic derivative of the thyrotropin molecule is shown to contain two major polypeptide components with approximate molecular weights of 14,000 and 6,000. Amino acid analyses, carbohydrate analyses, and tryptic digestion experiments indicate that this exophthalmogenic factor is composed of an intact or nearly intact beta subunit of thyrotropin and an NH2-terminal fragment of the alpha subunit of thyrotropin. Neither polypeptide component of the exophthalmogenic factor has the in vivo exophthalmogenic activity of the intact structure. In vitro the intact exophthalmogenic derivative of the thyrotropin molecule can bind to the thyrotropin receptor on thyroid membranes less efficiently than thyrotropin but significantly better than either its own polypeptide components or the alpha or beta subunits of thyrotropin. The exophthalmogenic factor and its parent thyrotropin molecule can stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in retro-orbital tissue membranes from guinea pigs, a mammalian model of exophthalmos; its polypeptide components have little or no such activity."

https://openalex.org/W2051707048,The flagellar apparatus (both flagella with basal bodies and accessory structures) of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was isolated from a wall-less mutant and induced to swim in the presence of adenosine triphosphate. The movement of the flagella of the isolated apparatus was largely synchronous and indistinguishable from the movement of flagella on living cells. These observations suggest that the mechanism of flagellar coordination in this biflagellate alga is largely intrinsic to the structure of the flagellar apparatus itself.
https://openalex.org/W1504218917,"A procedure has been designed for the simultaneous isolation, in a single step, of the nuclei and cytoplasm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae alphas288c spheroplasts. We have examined the polyadenylate poly(A)-containing RNA in these fractions and their kinetics of synthesis. Nuclear RNA saturates with [3H] adenine within 10 min. Labeled RNA appears very quickly in the cytoplasm, exceeding the amount of labeled nuclear RNA within 2 min after the addition of [3H] adenine. Nuclear poly(A)-containing RNA is approximately 10% of the total cellular poly(A)-containing RNA obtained from spheroplasts labeled for 15 min. Nuclear poly(A)-containing RNA is not as large as the giant heterogeneous nuclear RNA of animal cells. The distribution of molecular size in nuclear and cytoplasmic populations of poly(A)-containing RNA is very broad with the average size of the nuclear species being moderately larger than the cytoplasmic species. Three distinct size classes of poly(A), with different apparent kinetic properties, are obtained from yeast poly(A)-containing RNA. Their electrophoretic mobility suggests molecular lengths of approximately 20, 40, and 60 nucleotides (Groner, G., Hynes, N., and Phillips, S. (1975) Biochemistry, 13, 5378-5383). Each of these poly(A) classes are present in the mRNA from large and small polyribosomes."

Vesicles contain one or more of these electron transfer systems depending on the growth conditions of the parent cells. alpha-Glycerol-P dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase are present only in vesicles prepared from cells grown in the presence of glycerol or fumarate, respectively. Formate dehydrogenase and nitrate reductase activities, on the other hand, are present in vesicles from cells grown on a variety of media. alpha-Glycerol-P and formate are able to drive aerobic transport in vesicles prepared from anaerobically grown cells, indicating coupling between aerobic and anaerobic electron transfer systems."
https://openalex.org/W2147690876,"We have shown that the synthesis of active su+III tRNATyr from a phi80psu+III DNA template requires the action of four distinct enzymatic activities. The first of these, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, catalyzes the formation of a large molecular weight transcript, initiating synthesis at a specific site 41 nucleotides proximal to the 5' end of the su+III tRNATyr structural gene and continuing at least 100 nucleotides beyond the 3' terminus of the su+III tRNATyr sequence. The second required component, designated Fraction V, allows purified DNA-DEPENDENT RNA polymerase to function in tRNA synthesis. We have shown that this fraction contains an endonuclease that together with DNA-dependent RNA polymerase is responsible for the synthesis of su+III tRNATyr Thus, su+III tRNATyr precursor is not itself the primary transcription product of the su+III tRNATyr gene, but rather, it arises as a result of post-transcriptional cleavage of a much larger transcript by the action of the nuclease present in Fraction V. The third enzymatic activity required for synthesis of active su+III tRNATyr is a ribonuclease (RNase P III) that specifically catalyzes the removal of the 3' extra nucleotides from the su+III tRNATyr precursor. The fourth activity required for synthesis of tRNA is a previously identified endonuclease, RNase P, that specifically catalyzes the removal of the 5' extra nucleotides from tRNA precursors. The properties of RNase P purified according to the procedure developed in this laboratory have been compared with those of the enzyme purified from ribosomes according to the procedure described by Robertson et al. (Robertson, H.D., Altman, S., and Smith, F.D. (1972) J.Biol. Chem. 247, 5243-5251.)."
https://openalex.org/W1916533411,"The plasma esterase inhibitors alpha2-macroglobulin, alpha1-antitrypsin, C1-inhibitor, antithrombin-heparin cofactor, and, as previously described, soybean trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz) and diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (9) enhance the response of guinea pig macrophages to migration inhibitory factor. To obtain this effect, macrophages are incubated with inhibitors prior to assay. The data suggest that (a) the enhancement of migration inhibitory factor response is due to the inhibition of esterases associated with the macrophage through a distinct active site on the inhibitors, and (b) that the active sites of antithrombin-heparin cofactor and soybean trypsin inhibitor, which interact with the macrophage enzymes, are different from the active sites of these inhibitors which interact with thrombin and trypsin respectively. Chemical modification of the active site of antithrombin-heparin cofactor for thrombin and of soybean trypsin inhibitor for trypsin does not affect their capacity to enhance the migration inhibitory factor response. From studies with thrombin, it was known that antithrombin-heparin cofactor has a heparin binding site. Addition of heparin was found to prevent the migration inhibitory factor-enhancing effect of antithrombin-heparin cofactor. The present results suggest that plasma esterase inhibitors may play a regulatory role in the response of macrophages to mediators of cellular immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1591611679,"We have described an in vitro system in which active su+III tRNATyr is synthesized from a phi80psu++III DNA template. Using this system, we have identified four essential components that are required for synthesis of tRNA. The first of these is DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It has been shown that a crude preparation of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase synthesizes su++III tRNATyr precursor similar to that which has been isolated in vivo, and that this preparation is capable of supporting high levels of tRNA synthesis. With purified DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the su++III tRNATyr precursor was not observed as a transcription product and tRNA synthesis was below detetable levels. On this basis, a second essential component for tRNA synthesis was identified. This fraction, designated Fraction V, in combination with purified RNA polymerase, catalyzes the synthesis of precursor tRNA. The third component is a ribonuclease (RNase P III), which specifically catalyzes the removal of the extra nucleotides present at the 3' terminus of the tRNA precursor. In the absence of this fraction, the in vitro synthesized su++III tRNATyr is slightly larger than 4 S and contains additional nucleotides beyond the normal --CCAOH 3 terminus of the mature tRNA. The fourth essential component required is a fraction containing RNase P, a previously identified endonuclease which specifically catalyzes the removal of the 5' extra nucleotides present on tRNA precursors."

https://openalex.org/W228457112,"Complexes between 30 S ribosomal subunits and fMet-tRNA are formed during incubation of 30 S subunits with fMet-tRNA and all other components for initiation of protein synthesis, except R17 bacteriophage RNA. That these complexes serve as intermediates in the binding of messenger RNA is demonstrated directly by the finding that upon addition of R17 RNA, fMet-tRNA in preformed fMet-RNA-30 S complexes preferentially enters fMet-tRNA-30 S-R17 RNA complexes. On the other hand, incubation of 30 S ribosomal subunits with R17 RNA and all other components for initiation except fMet-tRNA does not yield 30 S-R17 RNA complexes that can act subsequently as functional intermediates in the binding of fMet-tRNA: formation of fMet-tRNA-30 S-R17 RNA complexes does not occur when fMet-tRNA is added and further binding of R17 RNA to 30 S subunits is prevented by specific inhibitors. These experiments lead to an unambiguous order of events in the sequence of initiation, in which binding of fMet-tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit must occur before messenger RNA can be bound and phased correctly. Complexes between fMet-tRNA and 60 S subunits are in rapid equilibrium with the free components, and have a half-life of less than 2 min at 37 degrees. This explains why such complexes are not detected in sucrose gradients, unless they are first fixed with glutaraldehyde. Attachment of R17 RNA, however, results in formation of an fMet-tRNA-30 S-R17 RNA complex that is stabilized greatly; fMet-tRNA in this complex exchanges only very slowly with free fMet-tRNA. Initiation factor IF-3 has two functions in initiation. The first is to direct the binding of messenger RNA to the 30 S-fMet-tRNA complex. This function is not needed when initiation complex formation occurs on ApUpG triplets, in which case the second function of IF-3 is detected, that of providing free 30 S subunits for initiation. The ability of IF-3 to bind directly to R17 RNA may be related to its requirement in messenger RNA recognition. However, since IF-3 exhibits a greater affinity for the 30 S subunit than for R17 RNA, it appears that the recognition function of IF-3 is expressed while IF-3 is associated with the 30 S subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1485665250,"2'-N-(2-Nitro-4-azidophenyl) aminoethyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside (APG2) is a competitive inhibitor of lactose transport in membrane vesicles isolated from Escherichia coli ML 308-225, exhibiting an apparent Ki of 30 to 40 muM, but is not transported. When irradiated with visible light in the presence of D-lactate, APG2 irreversibly inactivates the lac transport system. Imposition of a membrane potential (positive outside) by valinomycin-induced potassium efflux also causes APG2 photoinactivation. Strikingly, photoinactivation is not observed in the absence of D-lactate or a potassium diffusion gradient. Kinetic studies of the inactivation process yield a KD of 35 muM. Since lactose protects against the inactivation, it is apparent that these effects are specific for the lac transport system. The results show that APG2 inactivates from the outer surface of the vesicle membrane and support the previous hypothesis that the lac carrier protein is unable to bind external substrate in the absence of energy coupling."

Only four of the five fragments theoretically present could be accounted for in major yield when the cyanogen bromide reaction was carried out at room temperature. The NH2-terminal fragment, CB2, contained an internal homoserine which was not cleaved to any significant extent. The amino acid sequence around this internal homoserine was determined by isolating and partially determining the sequence of an alpha-chymotryptic peptide. Cleavage at this methionine was increased by 50% when the cyanogen bromide reaction was carried out at 37 degrees. The NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences of five major fragments were determined. The placement of these fragments in the native pepsin molecule was demonstrated. The amino acid sequence of one of the fragments, CB5, was determined. This fragment contains 44 residues with an internal disulfide bridge. The COOH-terminal methionine of this fragment was connected to another 37-residue cyanogen bromide fragment of known sequence.

https://openalex.org/W2415086081,"It is shown that factor i, a bacterial protein, specifically inhibits that step in the initiation of R17 bacteriophage RNA translation that involves the attachment of native R17 RNA to 30 S ribosomal subunits carrying fMet-tRNA. This inhibition by factor i is relieved by the addition of excess R17 RNA, but not by the addition of excess 30 S subunits. That R17 RNA is the only target of the inhibition is demonstrated further by the fact that in a cell-free extract containing all components for protein synthesis, factor i-mediated inhibition of exogenous R17 RNA translation can be overcome only by the addition of excess R17 RNA and not by excess cell-free extract. Upon relief of inhibition, phage coat protein synthesis is restored; enhancement of formation of other cistron products is not seen. While initiation of R17 RNA translation is blocked by factor i, chain elongation is not affected. Although foactor i inhibits the IF-3-dependent binding of R17 RNA to fMet-tRNA-30 S complexes, under conditions of initiation of protein synthesis formation of stable complexes between factor i and IF-3 could not be detected, and factor i did not interfere with the binding of IF-3 to free, native R17 RNA. Instead of affecting the function of IF-3 or ribosomes, factor i exerts its inhibition by binding to R17 RNA and acting as a translational repressor. Factor i prefers intact R17 RNA to fragments generated by autoradiolysis; its binding to R17 RNA is specific in that little competition is observed by transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA or poly(A). However, factor i has a high affinity for poly(U) sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1484111379,"The amino acid sequences of two cyanogen bromide fragments from porcine pepsin have been determined. Fragment CB3 which represents the NH2-terminal 80 residues of pepsin was assembled from the peptides purified from proteolytic digests of this fragment using alpha-chymotrypsin, thermolysin, and staphylococcal protease. Two chymotryptic peptides were isolated from the NH2-terminal region of this fragment. One of these contains 2 extra residues, Ala-Leu-, at the NH2 terminus. This peptide is apparently derived from a different cleavage site of pepsinogen in its conversion to pepsin. The second cyanogen bromide fragment, CB4, contains 47 residues. The sequence was established from the peptides resulting from proteolytic digests using alpha-chymotrypsin, alpha-lytic protease, and thermolysin. An isoleucyl residue at position 29 of fragment CB4 appears to be absent in some molecules. This represents a structural variant of pepsin."
https://openalex.org/W24298953,"Analyses of the x-ray diffraction intensity data by the Patterson synthesis and rotation function techniques show that the true space group of the monoclinic crystals of L-asparaginase (L-asparagine amidohydrolase, EC 3.5.1.1) from Proteus vulgaris is P21, that the molecular centers lie at x = 0.054, y = 0, z = 0.256, and its symmetry related positions, and that the tetramer molecules possess three approximate, mutually perpendicular 2-fold rotational symmetries, the axes of which run along the directions of the crystallographic a*-, b-, and c-axes. In addition, an investigation of the molecular packing arrangement in the crystal indicates that the tetramer molecules possess an approximately regular tetrahedral subunit structure."
