https://openalex.org/W4285007003,"Physiological blood flow induces the secretion of vasoactive compounds, notably nitric oxide, and promotes endothelial cell elongation and reorientation parallel to the direction of applied shear. How shear is sensed and relayed to intracellular effectors is incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that an apical spectrin network is essential to convey the force imposed by shear to endothelial mechanosensors. By anchoring CD44, spectrins modulate the cell surface density of hyaluronan and sense and translate shear into changes in plasma membrane tension. Spectrins also regulate the stability of apical caveolae, where the mechanosensitive PIEZO1 channels are thought to reside. Accordingly, shear-induced PIEZO1 activation and the associated calcium influx were absent in spectrin-deficient cells. As a result, cell realignment and flow-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase stimulation were similarly dependent on spectrin. We conclude that the apical spectrin network is not only required for shear sensing but also transmits and distributes the resulting tensile forces to mechanosensors that elicit protective and vasoactive responses."

https://openalex.org/W4285022297,"Astrocytes play many important functions in response to spinal cord injury (SCI) in an activated manner, including clearance of necrotic tissue, formation of protective barrier, maintenance of microenvironment balance, interaction with immune cells, and formation of the glial scar. More and more studies have shown that the astrocytes are heterogeneous, such as inflammatory astrocyte 1 (A1) and neuroprotective astrocyte 2 (A2) types. However, the subtypes of astrocyte resulting from SCI have not been clearly defined. In this study, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we constructed the transcriptomic profile of astrocytes from uninjured spinal cord tissue and injured tissue nearby the lesion epicenter at 0.5, 1, 3, 7, 14, 60, and 90 days after mouse hemisection spinal cord surgery. Our analysis uncovered six transcriptionally distinct astrocyte states, including Atp1b2+, S100a4+, Gpr84+, C3+/G0s2+, GFAP+/Tm4sf1+, and Gss+/Cryab+ astrocytes. We used these new signatures combined with canonical astrocyte markers to determine the distribution of morphologically and physiologically distinct astrocyte population at injured sites by immunofluorescence staining. Then we identified the dynamic evolution process of each astrocyte subtype following SCI. Finally, we also revealed the evolution of highly expressed genes in these astrocyte subtypes at different phases of SCI. Together, we provided six astrocyte subtypes at single-cell resolution following SCI. These data not only contribute to understand the heterogeneity of astrocytes during SCI but also help to find new astrocyte subtypes as a target for SCI repair."
https://openalex.org/W4285008237,"Defects in pathways governing genomic fidelity have been linked to improved response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB). Pathogenic POLE/POLD1 mutations can cause hypermutation, yet how diverse mutations in POLE/POLD1 influence antitumor immunity following ICB is unclear. Here, we comprehensively determined the effect of POLE/POLD1 mutations in ICB and elucidated the mechanistic impact of these mutations on tumor immunity. Murine syngeneic tumors harboring Pole/Pold1 functional mutations displayed enhanced antitumor immunity and were sensitive to ICB. Patients with POLE/POLD1 mutated tumors harboring telltale mutational signatures respond better to ICB than patients harboring wild-type or signature-negative tumors. A mutant POLE/D1 function-associated signature-based model outperformed several traditional approaches for identifying POLE/POLD1 mutated patients that benefit from ICB. Strikingly, the spectrum of mutational signatures correlates with the biochemical features of neoantigens. Alterations that cause POLE/POLD1 function-associated signatures generate T cell receptor (TCR)-contact residues with increased hydrophobicity, potentially facilitating T cell recognition. Altogether, the functional landscapes of POLE/POLD1 mutations shape immunotherapy efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W4285011397,"As ACE2 is the critical SARS-CoV-2 receptor, we hypothesized that aerosol administration of clinical grade soluble human recombinant ACE2 (APN01) will neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in the airways, limit spread of infection in the lung, and mitigate lung damage caused by deregulated signaling in the renin-angiotensin (RAS) and Kinin pathways. Here, after demonstrating in vitro neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by APN01, and after obtaining preliminary evidence of its tolerability and preventive efficacy in a mouse model, we pursued development of an aerosol formulation. As a prerequisite to a clinical trial, we evaluated both virus binding activity and enzymatic activity for cleavage of Ang II following aerosolization. We report successful aerosolization for APN01, retaining viral binding as well as catalytic RAS activity. Dose range-finding and IND-enabling repeat-dose aerosol toxicology testing were conducted in dogs. Twice daily aerosol administration for two weeks at the maximum feasible concentration revealed no notable toxicities. Based on these results, a Phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers has now been initiated (NCT05065645), with subsequent Phase II testing planned for individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W4285006447,"Abstract During sleep, sensory stimuli rarely trigger a behavioral response or conscious perception. However, it remains unclear whether sleep inhibits specific aspects of sensory processing, such as feedforward or feedback signaling. Here, we presented auditory stimuli (for example, click-trains, words, music) during wakefulness and sleep in patients with epilepsy, while recording neuronal spiking, microwire local field potentials, intracranial electroencephalogram and polysomnography. Auditory stimuli induced robust and selective spiking and high-gamma (80–200 Hz) power responses across the lateral temporal lobe during both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Sleep only moderately attenuated response magnitudes, mainly affecting late responses beyond early auditory cortex and entrainment to rapid click-trains in NREM sleep. By contrast, auditory-induced alpha–beta (10–30 Hz) desynchronization (that is, decreased power), prevalent in wakefulness, was strongly reduced in sleep. Thus, extensive auditory responses persist during sleep whereas alpha–beta power decrease, likely reflecting neural feedback processes, is deficient. More broadly, our findings suggest that feedback signaling is key to conscious sensory processing."
https://openalex.org/W4284890873,"Like many other apicomplexan parasites, Toxoplasma gondii contains a plastid harboring key metabolic pathways, including the sulfur utilization factor (SUF) pathway that is involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. These cofactors are crucial for a variety of proteins involved in important metabolic reactions, potentially including plastidic pathways for the synthesis of isoprenoid and fatty acids. It was shown previously that impairing the NFS2 cysteine desulfurase, involved in the first step of the SUF pathway, leads to an irreversible killing of intracellular parasites. However, the metabolic impact of disrupting the pathway remained unexplored. Here, we generated another mutant of this pathway, deficient in the SUFC ATPase, and investigated in details the phenotypic consequences of TgNFS2 and TgSUFC depletion on the parasites. Our analysis confirms that Toxoplasma SUF mutants are severely and irreversibly impacted in division and membrane homeostasis, and suggests a defect in apicoplast-generated fatty acids. However, we show that increased scavenging from the host or supplementation with exogenous fatty acids do not fully restore parasite growth, suggesting that this is not the primary cause for the demise of the parasites and that other important cellular functions were affected. For instance, we also show that the SUF pathway is key for generating the isoprenoid-derived precursors necessary for the proper targeting of GPI-anchored proteins and for parasite motility. Thus, we conclude plastid-generated iron-sulfur clusters support the functions of proteins involved in several vital downstream cellular pathways, which implies the SUF machinery may be explored for new potential anti-Toxoplasma targets."
https://openalex.org/W4285011537,"Monovalent vaccines using mRNA or adenoviruses have provided substantial protection against the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries. However, viral mutations have hampered the efficacy of this approach. The Omicron variant, which appeared in Dec 2021, has caused a pandemic that has exerted pressure on the healthcare system worldwide. The COVID-19 vaccines are not very effective against this variant, resulting in an increased rate of infection and mortality. Owing to the rapidly increasing number of patients, few countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, and Taiwan, which aimed at zero-COVID cases, have discontinued their attempts to contain the spread of infection by imposing strict lockdowns, for example. Therefore, the administration of booster vaccinations has been initiated; however, there are concerns about their effectiveness, sustainability, and possible dangers. There is also the question of how a variant with such isolated mutations originated and whether this is likely to continue in the future. Here, we compare the mutations in the Omicron variant with others by direct PCA to consider questions pertaining to their evolution and characterisation. The Omicron variant, like the other variants, has mutated in humans. The accumulated mutations overwhelmed the acquired immunity and caused a pandemic. Similar mutations are likely to occur in the future. Additionally, the variants infecting animals were investigated; they rapidly mutated in animals and varied from the human strains. These animal-adapted strains are probably not highly infectious or pathogenic to humans. Hence, the possibility of using these strains as vaccines will be discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4284990061,"Inhibitors that bind competitively to the ATP binding pocket in the kinase domain of the oncogenic fusion protein BCR-Abl1 are used successfully in targeted therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Such inhibitors provided the first proof of concept that kinase inhibition can succeed in a clinical setting. However, emergence of drug resistance and dose-dependent toxicities limit the effectiveness of these drugs. Therefore, treatment with a combination of drugs without overlapping resistance mechanisms appears to be an appropriate strategy. In the present work, we explore the effectiveness of combination therapies of the recently developed allosteric inhibitor asciminib with the ATP-competitive inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib in inhibiting the BCR-Abl1 kinase activity in CML cell lines. Through these experiments, we demonstrate that asciminib significantly enhances the inhibition activity of nilotinib, but not of dasatinib. Exploring molecular mechanisms for such allosteric enhancement via systematic computational investigation incorporating molecular dynamics, metadynamics simulations, and density functional theory calculations, we found two distinct contributions. First, binding of asciminib triggers conformational changes in the inactive state of the protein, thereby making the activation process less favorable by ∼4 kcal/mol. Second, the binding of asciminib decreases the binding free energies of nilotinib by ∼3 and ∼7 kcal/mol for the wildtype and T315I-mutated protein, respectively, suggesting the possibility of reducing nilotinib dosage and lowering risk of developing resistance in the treatment of CML."
https://openalex.org/W4285012226,"Background India has experienced the second largest outbreak of COVID-19 globally, yet there is a paucity of studies analysing contact tracing data in the region which can optimise public health interventions (PHI’s). Methods We analysed contact tracing data from Karnataka, India between 9 March and 21 July 2020. We estimated metrics of transmission including the reproduction number (R), overdispersion (k), secondary attack rate (SAR), and serial interval. R and k were jointly estimated using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We studied determinants of risk of further transmission and risk of being symptomatic using Poisson regression models. Findings Up to 21 July 2020, we found 111 index cases that crossed the super-spreading threshold of ≥8 secondary cases. Among 956 confirmed traced cases, 8.7% of index cases had 14.4% of contacts but caused 80% of all secondary cases. Among 16715 contacts, overall SAR was 3.6% [95% CI, 3.4–3.9] and symptomatic cases were more infectious than asymptomatic cases (SAR 7.7% vs 2.0%; aRR 3.63 [3.04–4.34]). As compared to infectors aged 19–44 years, children were less infectious (aRR 0.21 [0.07–0.66] for 0–5 years and 0.47 [0.32–0.68] for 6–18 years). Infectors who were confirmed ≥4 days after symptom onset were associated with higher infectiousness (aRR 3.01 [2.11–4.31]). As compared to asymptomatic cases, symptomatic cases were 8.16 [3.29–20.24] times more likely to cause symptomatic infection in their secondary cases. Serial interval had a mean of 5.4 [4.4–6.4] days, and case fatality rate was 2.5% [2.4–2.7] which increased with age. Conclusion We found significant heterogeneity in the individual-level transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 which could not be explained by the degree of heterogeneity in the underlying number of contacts. To strengthen contact tracing in over-dispersed outbreaks, testing and tracing delays should be minimised and retrospective contact tracing should be implemented. Targeted measures to reduce potential superspreading events should be implemented. Interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing transmission owing to their low symptomaticity and infectivity. We propose that symptomatic cases could cause a snowballing effect on clinical severity and infectiousness across transmission generations; further studies are needed to confirm this finding."
https://openalex.org/W4285004940,"The mammalian heart arises from various populations of Mesp1-expressing cardiovascular progenitors (CPs) that are specified during the early stages of gastrulation. Mesp1 is a transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of CP specification and differentiation. However, how Mesp1 regulates the chromatin landscape of nascent mesodermal cells to define the temporal and spatial patterning of the distinct populations of CPs remains unknown. Here, by combining ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq during mouse pluripotent stem cell differentiation, we defined the dynamic remodelling of the chromatin landscape mediated by Mesp1. We identified different enhancers that are temporally regulated to erase the pluripotent state and specify the pools of CPs that mediate heart development. We identified Zic2 and Zic3 as essential cofactors that act with Mesp1 to regulate its transcription-factor activity at key mesodermal enhancers, thereby regulating the chromatin remodelling and gene expression associated with the specification of the different populations of CPs in vivo. Our study identifies the dynamics of the chromatin landscape and enhancer remodelling associated with temporal patterning of early mesodermal cells into the distinct populations of CPs that mediate heart development."
https://openalex.org/W4285005415,"FOLFOX (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) is a chemotherapy treatment for colorectal cancer which induces toxic side effects involving fatigue, weakness, and skeletal muscle dysfunction. There is a limited understanding of the recovery from these toxicities after treatment cessation. Exercise training can improve chemotherapy-related toxicities. However, how exercise accelerates recovery and the dose required for these benefits are not well examined. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of exercise duration on physical function, muscle mass, and mitochondria protein expression during the recovery from FOLFOX chemotherapy. 12-week-old male mice were administered four cycles of either PBS or FOLFOX over 8-weeks. Outcomes were assessed after the fourth cycle and after either 4 (short-term; STR) or 10 weeks (long-term; LTR) recovery. Subsets of mice performed 14 sessions (6 d/wk, 18 m/min, 5% grade) of 60 min/d (long) or 15 min/d (short duration) treadmill exercise during STR. Red and white gastrocnemius mRNA and protein expression were examined. FOLFOX treatment decreased run time (RT) (-53%) and grip strength (GS) (-9%) compared to PBS. FOLFOX also reduced muscle OXPHOS complexes, COXIV, and VDAC protein expression. At LTR, FOLFOX RT (-36%) and GS (-16%) remained reduced. Long- and short-duration treadmill exercise improved RT (+58% and +56%) without restoring GS in FOLFOX mice. Both exercise durations increased muscle VDAC and COXIV expression in FOLFOX mice. These data provide evidence that FOLFOX chemotherapy induces persistent deficits in physical function that can be partially reversed by short-duration aerobic exercise."
https://openalex.org/W4285008010,"Decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) is a novel retardant. DBDPE is used in various flammable consumer products such as electronics, building materials, textiles, and children's toys. The presence of DBDPE in humans makes it extremely urgent to assess the health effects of DBDPE exposure. Here, we used female mice as an animal model to investigate the effects of DBDPE on embryonic development and offspring health. The results showed that 50 μg/kg bw/day of DBDPE exposure did not affect spindle rotation in oocytes after fertilization, but led to a decrease of pronuclei (PN) in zygotes. Further investigation found that DBDPE interferes with the self-assembly of F-actin in PN, resulting in PN reduction, DNA damage, and reduced expression of zygotic genome activating genes, and finally leading to abnormal embryonic development. More importantly, we found that maternal DBDPE exposure did not affect the growth and development of the first generation of offspring (F1) mice, but resulted in behavioral defects in F1 mice. Female F1 mice from DBDPE-exposed mothers exhibited increased motor activity and deficits in social behavior. Both female and male F1 mice from DBDPE-exposed mothers exhibited cognitive memory impairment. These results suggest that DBDPE has developmental toxicity on embryos and has a cross-generational interference effect. It is suggested that people should pay attention to the reproductive toxicity of DBDPE. In addition, it also provides a reference for studying the origin of neurological diseases and indicates that adult diseases caused by environmental pollutants may have begun in the embryonic stage."
https://openalex.org/W4285008463,"Renal pathology is essential for diagnosing and assessing the severity and prognosis of kidney diseases. Deep learning-based approaches have developed rapidly and have been applied in renal pathology. However, methods for the automated classification of normal and abnormal renal tubules remain scarce. Using a deep learning-based method, we aimed to classify normal and abnormal renal tubules, thereby assisting renal pathologists in the evaluation of renal biopsy specimens. Consequently, we developed a U-Net-based segmentation model using randomly selected regions obtained from 21 renal biopsy specimens. Further, we verified its performance in multiclass segmentation by calculating the Dice coefficients (DCs). We used 15 cases of tubulointerstitial nephritis to assess its applicability in aiding routine diagnoses conducted by renal pathologists and calculated the agreement ratio between diagnoses conducted by two renal pathologists and the time taken for evaluation. We also determined whether such diagnoses were improved when the output of segmentation was considered. The glomeruli and interstitium had the highest DCs, whereas the normal and abnormal renal tubules had intermediate DCs. Following the detailed evaluation of the tubulointerstitial compartments, the proximal, distal, atrophied, and degenerated tubules had intermediate DCs, whereas the arteries and inflamed tubules had low DCs. The annotation and output areas involving normal and abnormal tubules were strongly correlated in each class. The pathological concordance for the glomerular count, t, ct, and ci scores of the Banff classification of renal allograft pathology remained high with or without the segmented images. However, in terms of time consumption, the quantitative assessment of tubulitis, tubular atrophy, degenerated tubules, and the interstitium was improved significantly when renal pathologists considered the segmentation output. Deep learning algorithms can assist renal pathologists in the classification of normal and abnormal tubules in renal biopsy specimens, thereby facilitating the enhancement of renal pathology and ensuring appropriate clinical decisions."
https://openalex.org/W4285012290,"The Unified Protocol (UP) as a transdiagnostic intervention has primarily been applied in the treatment of anxiety disorders and in face-to-face-settings. The current study investigated the efficacy of a 10-week Internet-based adaptation of the UP for anxiety, depressive, and somatic symptom disorders. The trial was registered under DRKS00014820 at the German Clinical Trial Registry, DRKS. Participants (n = 129) were randomized to treatment or waitlist control. Significant treatment effects were found for symptom distress, satisfaction with life, positive/negative affect and markers of anxiety, depression, and somatic symptom burden (within-group Hedges' g = 0.32-1.38 and between-group g = 0.20-1.11). Treatment gains were maintained at 1- and 6-month-follow-up. Subgroup analyses showed comparable effects in participants with anxiety and depressive disorders. 26.6% dropped out of treatment and 35.38% did not provide post-treatment assessments. The results strengthen the application of the UP as an Internet-based treatment for alleviating symptom distress across emotional disorders. More research on the applicability for single disorders is needed and avenues to improve adherence and attrition rates should be explored."
https://openalex.org/W4285013109,"Psittacosis pneumonia is a community-acquired pneumonia caused by Chlamydia psittaci. It is usually under-diagnosed due to its atypical clinical presentation and lack of routine laboratory tests.To better understand the clinical features, 52 patients diagnosed with psittacosis pneumonia by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) were enrolled in this study. The clinical, radiological and pathological characteristics were retrospectively analyzed.The onset of psittacosis pneumonia in this study occurred all year round, with a peak from December to January. Most of the patients were 51-80 years old. About 65.38% of patients had a history of exposure to poultry or parrots. Abnormalities of multiple clinical signals were detected in these patients. Elevated levels of neutrophil ratio, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and procalcitonin were detected in most patients. Radiological evidence revealed air-space consolidation or ground-glass opacities in lungs of all patients, which is the typical feature of psittacosis pneumonia. In addition, hyperemia, swelling of bronchial mucosa, and bronchial patency were detected by bronchoscopy in all patients, and bronchial sub-mucosal edema, inflammatory cells infiltration and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia were identified in the bronchial mucosa and alveolar tissue. Beta-lactam antibiotics were administered for empirical treatment before mNGS in 17 patients but showed no improvement. The treatment was switched to doxycycline or moxifloxacin immediately since psittacosis pneumonia were suspected and confirmed by mNGS detection (within 48 hours). After receiving adjustment of treatment, 94.23% (49/52) of patients were cured successfully.In conclusion, mNGS may be a promising approach for clinical diagnosis of psittacosis. For patients with a history of exposure to birds, hyperpyrexia, nonproductive cough, multiple elevated inflammatory markers, and air-space consolidation in lung, psittacosis pneumonia should be considered, especially when beta-lactam antibiotics showed limited efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W4284976869,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecological cancer. OC cells have high proliferative capacity, are invasive, resist apoptosis, and tumors often display rearrangement of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, contributing to accelerated tumor progression. The multifunctional protein tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is known to be secreted in the tumor microenvironment, where it interacts with fibronectin (FN) and the cell surface receptor integrin β1. However, the mechanistic role of TG2 in cancer cell proliferation is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that TG2 directly interacts with and facilitates the phosphorylation and activation of the integrin effector protein integrin-linked kinase (ILK) at Ser246. We show that TG2 and p-Ser246-ILK form a complex that is detectable in patient-derived OC primary cells grown on FN-coated slides. In addition, we show that coexpression of TGM2 and ILK correlates with poor clinical outcome. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that TG2-mediated ILK activation causes phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β, allowing β-catenin nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Furthermore, inhibition of TG2 and ILK using small molecules, neutralizing antibodies, or shRNA-mediated knockdown blocks cell adhesion to the FN matrix, as well as the Wnt receptor response to the Wnt-3A ligand, and ultimately, cell adhesion, growth, and migration. In conclusion, we demonstrate that TG2 directly interacts with and activates ILK in OC cells and tumors and define a new mechanism that links ECM cues with β-catenin signaling in OC. These results suggest a central role of TG2–FN–integrin clusters in ECM rearrangement and indicate that downstream effector ILK may represent a potential new therapeutic target in OC.

These data point toward the direct involvement of integrin–ILK axis as a modulator of the crosstalk between ECM rearrangement and the canonical Wnt signaling activation in a cell-type and cellular context–dependent role. However, the connection between integrins and β-catenin remains not well delineated.Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is a multifunctional protein that catalyzes Ca2+-dependent protein crosslinking and hydrolyzes GTP (25Fesus L. Piacentini M. Transglutaminase 2: an enigmatic enzyme with diverse functions.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The distinct TG2 functions are finely regulated by Ca2+ and GTP levels; the crosslinking activity is allosterically activated by high Ca2+ concentrations, whereas high intracellular GTP levels inhibit TGase activity (25Fesus L. Piacentini M. Transglutaminase 2: an enigmatic enzyme with diverse functions.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). TG2 has four distinct domains: an N-terminal with FN-binding site; a catalytic core; a GTP-binding site; and the C-terminal region that can recruit and activate phospholipase C (26Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Three-dimensional structure of a transglutaminase: human blood coagulation factor XIII.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7296-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of TG2 binds directly to the 42-kDa gelatin-binding domain of FN with high affinity (Kd ∼8–10 nM) (27Turner P.M. Lorand L. Complexation of fibronectin with tissue transglutaminase.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), facilitating the formation of a complex with β1 integrin, which is essential to stabilizing the ECM and cell adhesion to the basement membrane (28Akimov S.S.

This mechanism, linked to the secretion of TG2 in the extracellular compartment (29Yakubov B. Chelladurai B. Schmitt J. Emerson R. Turchi J.J. Matei D.

TG2 is overexpressed in ovarian tumors compared with normal ovarian epithelium and promotes enhanced peritoneal dissemination (32Satpathy M. Cao L. Pincheira R. Emerson R. Bigsby R.

Previously, we reported that by promoting integrin-mediated cell adhesion to FN, TG2 regulated β-catenin activation through a c-Src–dependent mechanism, promoting OC cell proliferation (33Condello S.

Other studies showed a direct interaction between extracellular TG2 and the low-density lipoprotein receptor–related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6), activating β-catenin in osteoblasts (34Faverman L.

We also demonstrated that formation of TG2/Frizzled 7 (Fzd7) clusters promoted a cancer stem cell phenotype through the activation of β-catenin signaling (30Condello S. Sima L. Ivan C. Cardenas H. Schiltz G. Mishra R.K. et al.Tissue tranglutaminase regulates interactions between ovarian cancer stem cells and the tumor Niche.Cancer Res. 2018; 78: 2990-3001Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Here, we tested the hypothesis that TG2-mediated FN rearrangement, and the subsequent activation of the integrin–ILK signaling mechanistically stabilizes β-catenin. We show that TG2 directly interacts with ILK and promotes its phosphorylation at Ser246. TG2 and phosho-ILKSer246 (p-ILKSer246) form a complex that plays a key role in the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Our results uncover a mechanistic link between TG2, ILK, and β-catenin, connecting the interface between cancer cells and ECM with Wnt-regulated cell survival and proliferation.ResultsTG2 expression activates ILK in OC cellsFirst, we determined whether TG2-mediated FN–integrin cluster formation altered ILK phosphorylation in OC cells by using an antibody (Ab) that specifically detects p-ILK at Ser246. SKOV3 and OVCAR-5 cells were transduced with a viral vector carrying scrambled shRNA sequence (control; sh-Ctr) or shRNA against TG2 at different targeting sites (sh-TG2) (clones #1, #2, and #3) and plated on plastic or FN-coated plates for 2 h. Western blot (WB) analyses confirmed a significant decrease in TG2 expression levels in both sh-TG2 SKOV3 and OVCAR-5 cells in all three shRNA clones (Fig. S1, A and B). The experiments were conducted using the most efficient shTG2 clone #1 in both cell lines (Figs. 1A and S2A; p < 0.0001) and revealed that p-ILKSer246 levels decreased by approximately fourfold in sh-TG2 SKOV3 and OVCAR-5 cells compared with the sh-Ctr cells (Figs. 1A and S2A; p < 0.001, p < 0.0001, respectively) grown on FN. Consistently, all the sh-TG2 clones showed a decrease in p-ILKSer246 levels (Fig. S1, A and B). Of interest, OC cells grown on plastic displayed weak basal levels of p-ILKSer246, and no significant differences were observed in TG2-expressing OC cells compared with sh-TG2 cells (Fig. S3, A and E). In addition, no significant changes were observed in total ILK expression in sh-TG2 compared with sh-Ctr OC cells grown on FN or plastic (Figs. 1A, S1, A and B, S2A and S3, A and E).Quantification of immunofluorescence (IF) staining confirmed significantly increased p-ILKSer246 staining in sh-Ctr compared with sh-TG2 transduced cells (Figs. 1, B and C and S2, B and C; p < 0.0001) plated on FN. IF confocal and colocalization analysis showed that TG2 and p-ILKSer246 were significantly colocalized in both sh-Ctr SKOV3 (Rcoloc = 0. 42) and sh-Ctr OVCAR-5 cells (Rcoloc = 0.545) plated on FN compared with sh-TG2 SKOV3 (Rcoloc = 0.006, p < 0.0001) and sh-TG2 OVCAR-5 cells (Rcoloc = 0.009, p < 0.0001) (Figs. 1D and S2D). Quantification of IF signals for both sh-Ctr OC cells plated on plastic showed significantly higher p-ILKSer246 levels compared with sh-TG2 cells (Fig. S3, B, C, F and G; p < 0.0001). Confocal analysis confirmed the decrease of TG2–p-ILKSer246 active complexes in both sh-TG2 SKOV3 (Rcoloc = 0.001, p < 0.0001) and sh-TG2 OVCAR-5 cells (Rcoloc = 0.0029, p < 0.0001) plated on plastic compared with sh-Ctr SKOV3 (Rcoloc = 0.1) and sh-Ctr OVCAR-5 cells (Rcoloc = 0.086) (Fig. S3, D and H, respectively). Of note, the overall basal p-ILKSer246 levels and TG2–p-ILKSer246 clusters in OC cells plated on plastic alone were detected at lesser extent compared with their counterpart plated on FN. These data confirm that ILK activation is ECM substrate dependent and functionally regulated by TG2 in OC cells.Next, to determine whether TG2–p-ILKSer246 complexes are detectable in human tumors, we used proximity ligation assay (PLA), a technique capable of identifying proteins localized within 40 nm distance in tissue. TG2 and p-ILKSer246 expression and colocalization were measured in primary human cells isolated from deidentified malignant ascites specimens and plated on plastic or FN-coated plates (N = 4 specimens). TG2–p-ILKSer246 complex formation was detectable at the cell membrane and in invadopodia in all human OC cells plated on FN but not in primary OC cells plated on plastic (Fig. 1, E and F; p < 0.05; p < 0.01), supporting a functional interaction between the two proteins in malignant cells. Furthermore, p-ILKSer246 formed complexes with integrin β1 and FN when primary OC cells were plated on FN compared with plastic alone (Fig. S2, E, F, I and J; p < 0.01; p < 0.001; and p < 0.0001). The results point to an important role of TG2–FN–integrin clusters activating the downstream effector p-ILKSer246 in OC cells.In addition, analysis of 489 clinically annotated high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) OC database was obtained from cBioPortal. ILK expression was correlated with TGM2 (Spearman r = 0.15, p = 1.2e-3 and Pearson r = 0.15, p = 2.9e-4; Fig. 1G), ITGB1 (Spearman r = 0.11, p = 0.0124 and Pearson r = 0.12, p = 9.8e-3; Fig. S2G) and with FN1 (Spearman r = 0.2, p = 5.2e-6 and Pearson r = 0.19, p = 1.8e-5; Fig. S2H). Furthermore, analysis of HGSOC tumor microarray data of 14 datasets from seven different array platforms using OvMark demonstrated that patients with higher than median TGM2 and ILK expression levels had an increased estimated risk of death when compared with those with lower than median TGM2 and ILK combined expression levels (Fig. 1H; hazard ratio [HR] =1.58, p = 0.002). Similar results were obtained by comparing patients with tumors harboring higher than median ITGB1 or FN1 and ILK combined expression levels (Fig. S2, H and L; HR = 1.679, p = 0.008; and HR = 1.72, p = 0.005, respectively). These data support the significance of ILK in cooperation with TG2 in human ovarian tumors affecting clinical outcomes.TG2 forms a protein complex with ILKWe demonstrate whether TG2 and ILK form a complex, we tested for a potential interaction by performing coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) in cell lysates from SKOV3 cells. WB with anti-TG2 and anti-ILK Abs demonstrated that the two proteins were detectable in complexes immunoprecipitated with anti-TG2 and anti-ILK Abs (Fig. 2A). To further define the interaction between TG2 and ILK, we used full-length recombinant human TG2 and ILK proteins. Co-IP with anti-TG2 and anti-ILK Abs demonstrated direct interaction between recombinant TG2 and ILK (Fig. 2B). In addition, His-tagged TG2 and FLAG-tagged ILK were immunoprecipitated with anti-His and anti-FLAG Abs from lysates of sh-TG2 SKOV3 cells stably cotransfected with pCMV3-TGM2-C-His and pCMV3-ILK-C-FLAG expression plasmids (Fig. 2C). Together, these data confirm the direct interaction between TG2 and ILK.Figure 2TG2 interacts with ILK and activated ILK in OC cells.

These data demonstrated the critical dual role of TG2 promoting the interaction between FN matrices and the β1 integrins followed by the recruitment of the adaptor protein ILK in both extracellular and intracellular compartments.TG2–FN interaction activates ILK and mediates β-catenin nuclear translocationThe Wnt/β-catenin signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that determines fate decisions for cells and tissues during embryonic development (36Kozmikova I. Kozmik Z. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is an evolutionarily conserved determinant of chordate dorsal organizer.Elife. 2020; 9: e56817Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the presence of Wnt ligands, β-catenin is dephosphorylated at Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 residues (37Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T.

https://openalex.org/W4284993931,"Alpha-synuclein (a-Syn) is a presynaptic protein, the misfolding of which is associated with Parkinson's disease. Rab GTPases are small guanine nucleotide binding proteins that play key roles in vesicle trafficking and have been associated with a-Syn function and dysfunction. a-Syn is enriched on synaptic vesicles, where it has been reported to interact with GTP-bound Rab3a, a master regulator of synaptic vesicle trafficking. a-Syn is known to bind weakly to Rab8a in solution via a positively charged patch, but the physiological implications of such interactions have not been explored. Here, we investigate direct interactions between a-Syn and Rab3a in solution and on lipid membranes using NMR spectroscopy. We find that the C terminus of a-Syn interacts with Rab3a in a manner similar to its previously reported interaction with Rab8a. While weak in solution, we demonstrate that this interaction becomes stronger when the proteins are bound to a membrane surface. The Rab3a binding site for a-Syn is similar to the surface that contacts the Rab3a effector rabphilin-3A, which modulates the enzymatic activity of Rab3a. Accordingly, we show that a-Syn inhibits GTP hydrolysis by Rab3a and that inhibition is more potent on the membrane surface, suggesting that their interaction may be functionally relevant. Finally, we show that phosphorylation of a-Syn residue Ser 129, a modification associated with Parkinson's disease pathology, enhances its interactions with Rab3a and increases its ability to inhibit Rab3a GTP hydrolysis. These results represent the first observation of a functional role for synuclein-Rab interactions and for a-Syn Ser 129 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W4285008972,"There is a growing interest in developing new molecular markers of heart disease in young dogs affected by myxomatous mitral valve disease. The study aimed to measure 3 circulating microRNAs and their application as potential biomarkers in the plasma of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with early asymptomatic myxomatous mitral valve disease. The hypothesis is that healthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels have different microRNA expression profiles than affected dogs in American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) stage B1. The profiles can differ within the same class among subjects of different ages. This is a prospective cross-sectional study. Thirty-three Cavalier King Charles Spaniels in ACVIM stage B1 were divided into three groups (11 younger than 3 years, 11 older than 3 years and younger than 7 years, and 11 older than 7 years), and 11 healthy (ACVIM stage A) dogs of the same breed were included as the control group. Three circulating microRNAs (miR-1-3p, miR30b-5p, and miR-128-3p) were measured by quantitative real-time PCR using TaqMan® probes. Diagnostic performance was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). MiR-30b-5p was significantly higher in ACVIM B1 dogs than in ACVIM A subjects, and the area under the receiver operating curve was 0.79. According to the age of dogs, the amount of miR-30b-5p was statistically significantly higher in group B1<3y (2.3 folds, P = 0.034), B1 3-7y (2.2 folds, P = 0.028), and B1>7y (2.7 folds, P = 0.018) than in group A. The area under the receiver operating curves were fair in discriminating between group B1<3y and group A (AUC 0.780), between B1 3-7y and A (AUC 0.78), and good in discriminating between group B1>7y and A (AUC 0.822). Identifying dogs with early asymptomatic myxomatous mitral valve disease through the evaluation of miR-30b-5p represents an intriguing possibility that certainly merits further research. Studies enrolling a larger number of dogs with preclinical stages of myxomatous mitral valve disease are needed to expand further and validate conclusively the preliminary findings from this report."

However, the optimal sequence between radiation and ICB remains unclear. To investigate the impact of sequence of radiation in anti-PD-L1 antibody (P1) therapy on immune microenvironments and antitumor efficacies in local and abscopal tumors, metastatic LM8 osteosarcoma cells were inoculated into both legs of C3H mice. For irradiation, only one side leg was irradiated at 10 Gy. Then mice were divided into four groups: administrated anti-PD-L1 antibody three times (P1 monotherapy), receiving radiation 3 days prior to P1 therapy (P1+pre-Rad), and receiving concurrent radiation with P1 therapy (P1+conc-Rad). Thereafter, tumor immune microenvironment and tumor volume changes were analyzed in irradiated and unirradiated tumors. The P1+pre-Rad regimen increased the proportion of CD8+ programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)+ granzyme B (GzmB)+ reinvigorated T cells and decreased the proportion of CD8+ PD-1+ GzmB- exhausted T cells than P1+conc-Rad regimen in unirradiated tumors. Combination regimens suppressed tumor growth in irradiated tumors compared with that in P1 monotherapy. In both irradiated and unirradiated tumors, significant tumor growth suppression and prolonged overall survival were observed under both combination treatment regimens compared with P1 monotherapy. However, no distinct differences in unirradiated tumor volume and survival were observed between P1+pre-Rad and P1+conc-Rad groups. These results suggest that local irradiation is necessary to improve systemic treatment efficacy in P1 therapy regardless of sequence of local irradiation."

An unsupervised, exploratory cluster analysis approach using the k-mode algorithm and partitioning around medoids detected two distinct clusters in a cross-sectional data set of milk yield, milk fat content, milk protein content as well as F. hepatica or O. ostertagi bulk tank milk antibody status from 606 dairy farms in three structurally different dairying regions in Germany. Parasite-positive farms grouped together with their respective production parameters to form separate clusters. A random forests algorithm characterised clusters with regard to external variables. Across all study regions, co-infections with F. hepatica or O. ostertagi, respectively, farming type, and pasture access appeared to be the most important factors discriminating clusters (i.e. farms). Furthermore, farm level lameness prevalence, herd size, BCS, stage of lactation, and somatic cell count were relevant criteria distinguishing clusters. This study is among the first to apply a cluster analysis approach in this context and potentially the first to implement a k-medoids algorithm and partitioning around medoids in the veterinary field. The results demonstrated that biologically relevant patterns of parasite status and milk parameters exist between farms positive for F. hepatica or O. ostertagi, respectively, and negative farms. Moreover, the machine learning approach confirmed results of previous work and shed further light on the complex setting of associations a between parasitic diseases, milk yield and milk constituents, and management practices."
https://openalex.org/W4285006978,"The prevalence of patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) remains unknown because such data are not routinely captured in structured electronic health records. This study sought to develop and validate a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to identify information related to being INEADS from clinical notes. We used a publicly available dataset of critical care patients from 2001 through 2012 at a United States academic medical center, which contained 418,393 relevant clinical notes for 23,904 adult admissions. We developed 17 subcategories indicating reduced or elevated potential for being INEADS, and created a vocabulary of terms and expressions within each. We used an NLP application to create a language model and expand these vocabularies. The NLP algorithm was validated against gold standard manual review of 300 notes and showed good performance overall (F-score = 0.83). More than 80% of admissions had notes containing information in at least one subcategory. Thirty percent (n = 7,134) contained at least one of five social subcategories indicating elevated potential for being INEADS, and <1% (n = 81) contained at least four, which we classified as high likelihood of being INEADS. Among these, n = 8 admissions had no subcategory indicating reduced likelihood of being INEADS, and appeared to meet the definition of INEADS following manual review. Among the remaining n = 73 who had at least one subcategory indicating reduced likelihood of being INEADS, manual review of a 10% sample showed that most did not appear to be INEADS. Compared with the full cohort, the high likelihood group was significantly more likely to die during hospitalization and within four years, to have Medicaid, to have an emergency admission, and to be male. This investigation demonstrates potential for NLP to identify INEADS patients, and may inform interventions to enhance advance care planning for patients who lack social support."
https://openalex.org/W4285012834,"Initiation rituals such as hazing, bullying, and ragging, as it is referred to in Sri Lanka, is a global phenomenon and has become a serious public health problem. Students are bullied and harassed by senior students causing them to suffer severe adverse consequences including depression, increased university dropouts and suicide. Although this has led to a significant burden on the country, research on ragging is scarce. The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of students concerning the phenomenon of ragging and to understand how ragging affects student life and culture at the University of Jaffna, Sri Lanka. This paper is based on 17 focus group discussions with male and female students of Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim ethnicity. Thematic analysis was employed to navigate through the theoretical lenses of structural violence, intersectionality, and social dominance. The findings revealed how students perceived ragging differently; as an expression of power to initiate order and as a way to express dissatisfaction towards social inequalities occurring within the larger society or to facilitate bonds between university students. Students trivialized violence related to ragging and accepted it as a part of the university subculture despite being aware of the dire consequences. There was a described cyclical nature to ragging whereby victims become perpetrators. The student's perspective appeared to be a missed opportunity in finding feasible solutions to a societal problem that must take all parties involved, into consideration."
https://openalex.org/W4285023780,"d-alanine (d-Ala) and several other d-amino acids (d-AAs) act as hormones and neuromodulators in nervous and endocrine systems. Unlike the endogenously synthesized d-serine in animals, d-Ala may be from exogenous sources, e.g., diet and intestinal microorganisms. However, it is unclear if the capability to produce d-Ala and other d-AAs varies among different microbial strains in the gut. We isolated individual microorganisms of rat gut microbiota and profiled their d-AA production in vitro, focusing on d-Ala. Serial dilutions of intestinal contents from adult male rats were plated on agar to obtain clonal cultures. Using MALDI-TOF MS for rapid strain typing, we identified 38 unique isolates, grouped into 11 species based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. We then used two-tier screening to profile bacterial d-AA production, combining a d-amino acid oxidase-based enzymatic assay for rapid assessment of non-acidic d-AA amount and chiral LC–MS/MS to quantify individual d-AAs, revealing 19 out of the 38 isolated strains as d-AA producers. LC–MS/MS analysis of the eight top d-AA producers showed high levels of d-Ala in all strains tested, with substantial inter- and intra-species variations. Though results from the enzymatic assay and LC–MS/MS analysis aligned well, LC–MS/MS further revealed the existence of d-glutamate and d-aspartate, which are poor substrates for this enzymatic assay. We observed large inter- and intra-species variation of d-AA production profiles from rat gut microbiome species, demonstrating the importance of chemical profiling of gut microbiota in addition to sequencing, furthering the idea that microbial metabolites modulate host physiology."
https://openalex.org/W4285010757,"Plant leaf area (LA) is a key metric in plant monitoring programs. Machine learning methods were used in this study to estimate the LA of four plum genotypes, including three greengage genotypes (Prunus domestica [subsp. italica var. claudiana.]) and a single myrobalan plum (prunus ceracifera), using leaf length (L) and width (W) values. To develop reliable models, 5548 leaves were subjected to experiments in two different years, 2019 and 2021. Image processing technique was used to extract dimensional leaf features, which were then fed into Linear Multivariate Regression (LMR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Model evaluation on 2019 data revealed that the LMR structure LA = 0.007+0.687 L×W was the most accurate among the various LMR structures, with R2 = 0.9955 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 0.404. In this case, the linear kernel-based SVR yielded an R2 of 0.9955 and an RMSE of 0.4871. The ANN (R2 = 0.9969; RMSE = 0.3420) and ANFIS (R2 = 0.9971; RMSE = 0.3240) models demonstrated greater accuracy than the LMR and SVR models. Evaluating the models mentioned above on data from various genotypes in 2021 proved their applicability for estimating LA with high accuracy in subsequent years. In another research segment, LA prediction models were developed using data from 2021, and evaluations demonstrated the superior performance of ANN and ANFIS compared to LMR and SVR models. ANFIS, ANN, LMR, and SVR exhibited R2 values of 0.9971, 0.9969, 0.9950, and 0.9948, respectively. It was concluded that by combining image analysis and modeling through ANFIS, a highly accurate smart non-destructive LA measurement system could be developed."
https://openalex.org/W4285013673,"We apply the new GenomeBits method to uncover underlying genomic features of omicron and delta coronavirus variants. This is a statistical algorithm whose salient feature is to map the nucleotide bases into a finite alternating (±) sum series of distributed terms of binary (0,1) indicators. We show how by this method, distinctive signals can be uncovered out of the intrinsic data organization of amino acid progressions along their base positions. Results reveal a sort of 'ordered' (or constant) to 'disordered' (or peaked) transition around the coronavirus S-spike protein region. Together with our previous results for past variants of coronavirus: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon and Eta, we conclude that the mapping into GenomeBits strands of omicron and delta variants can help to characterize mutant pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W4285014067,"Multiple camera systems are widely used for 3D-motion analysis. Due to increasing accuracies these camera systems gained interest in biomechanical research areas, where high precision measurements are desirable. In the current study different measurement systems were compared regarding their measurement accuracy.Translational and rotational accuracy measurements as well as the zero offset measurements of seven different measurement systems were performed using two reference devices and two different evaluation algorithms. All measurements were performed in the same room with constant temperature at the same laboratory. Equal positions were measured with the systems according to a standardized protocol. Measurement errors were determined and compared.The highest measurement errors were seen for a measurement system using active ultrasonic markers, followed by another active marker measurement system (infrared) having measurement errors up to several hundred micrometers. The highest accuracies were achieved by three stereo camera systems, using passive 2D marker points having errors typically below 20 μm.This study can help to better assess the results obtained with different measurement systems. With the focus on the measurement accuracy, only one aspect in the selection of a system was considered. Depending on the requirements of the user, other factors like measurement frequency, the maximum analyzable volume, the marker type or the costs are important factors as well."

https://openalex.org/W4285025488,"Barth Syndrome (BTHS) is a rare X-linked genetic disorder caused by mutation in the TAFAZZIN gene. Tafazzin (Taz) deficiency in BTHS patients results in an increased risk of infections. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are well known for their immune-inhibitory function. We examined how Taz-deficiency in murine MSCs impact their ability to modulate the function of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated wild type (WT) B lymphocytes. MSCs from tafazzin knockdown (TazKD) mice exhibited a reduction in mitochondrial cardiolipin compared to wild type (WT) MSCs. However, mitochondrial bioenergetics and membrane potential were unaltered. In contrast, TazKD MSCs exhibited increased reactive oxygen species generation and increased glycolysis. The increased glycolysis was associated with an elevated proliferation, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase expression and expression of the immunosuppressive markers indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, interleukin-10, and cluster of differentiation 59 compared to controls. Inhibition of glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose attenuated the TazKD-mediated increased expression of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 and interleukin-10. When co-cultured with LPS-activated WT B cells, TazKD MSCs inhibited B cell proliferation and growth rate and reduced B cell secretion of immunoglobulin M compared to controls. In addition, co-culture of LPS-activated WT B cells with TazKD MSCs promoted B cell differentiation toward interleukin-10 secreting plasma cells and B regulatory cells compared to controls. The results indicate that Taz deficiency in MSCs promote reprogramming of activated B lymphocytes toward immunosuppressive phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W4285028527,"The Internal–External Locus of Control Short Scale–4 (IE-4) measures two dimensions of the personality trait locus of control with two items each. IE-4 was originally developed and validated in German and later translated into English. In the present study, we assessed the psychometric properties (i.e., objectivity, reliability, validity) of the English-language IE-4, compared these psychometric properties with those of the German-language source version, and tested measurement invariance across both language versions. Using heterogeneous quota samples from the UK and Germany, we find that the English-language adaptation has satisfactory reliability and plausible correlations with 11 external variables (e.g., general self-efficacy, self-esteem, impulsive behavior, Emotional Stability), which are comparable with those of the German-language source version. Moreover, metric measurement invariance of the scale holds when comparing the UK and Germany, implying the comparability of correlations based on the latent factors across the two nations. As an ultra-short scale (completion time &lt; 30 s), IE-4 lends itself particularly to the assessment of locus of control in survey contexts in which assessment time or questionnaire space are limited. It can be applied in a variety of research disciplines, such as psychology, sociology, or economics."
https://openalex.org/W4285007357,"Obese women have a higher risk of developing endometrial cancer (EC) than lean women. Besides affecting EC progression, obesity also affects sensitivity of patients to treatment including medroxprogesterone acetate (MPA). Obese women have a lower response to MPA with an increased risk for tumor recurrence. While MPA inhibits the growth of normal fibroblasts, human endometrial cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were reported to be less responsive to MPA. However, it is still unknown how CAFs from obese women respond to progesterone. CAFs from the EC tissues of obese (CO) and non-obese (CN) women were established as primary cell models. MPA increased cell proliferation and downregulated stromal differentiation genes, including BMP2 in CO than in CN. Induction of IRS2 (a BMP2 regulator) mRNA expression by MPA led to activation of glucose metabolism in CO, with evidence of greater mRNA levels of GLUT6, GAPDH, PKM2, LDHA, and increased in GAPDH enzymatic activity. Concomitantly, MPA increased the mRNA expression of a fatty acid transporter, CD36 and lipid droplet formation in CO. MPA-mediated increase in glucose metabolism genes in CO was reversed with a progesterone receptor inhibitor, mifepristone (RU486), leading to a decreased proliferation. Our data suggests that PR signaling is aberrantly activated by MPA in CAFs isolated from endometrial tissues of obese women, leading to activation of IRS2 and glucose metabolism, which may lead to lower response and sensitivity to progesterone in obese women."
https://openalex.org/W4285014918,"The massively and rapidly spreading disinformation on social network platforms poses a serious threat to public safety and social governance. Therefore, early and accurate detection of rumors in social networks is of vital importance before they spread on a large scale. Considering the small-world property of social networks, the source tweet-word graph is decomposed from the global graph of rumors, and a rumor detection method based on graph attention network of source tweet-word graph is proposed to fully learn the structure of rumor propagation and the deep representation of text contents. Specifically, the proposed model can adequately capture the contextual semantic association representation of source tweets during the propagation and extract semantic features. For the data sparseness of the early stage of information dissemination, text attention mechanism based on opinion similarity can aggregate and capture more tweet propagation structure features to help improve the efficiency of early detection of rumors. Through the analysis of the experimental results on real public datasets, the rumor detection performance of the proposed method is better than that of other baseline methods. Especially in the early rumor detection tasks, the proposed method can detect rumors with an accuracy of nearly 90% in the early stage of information dissemination. And it still has good robustness with noise interference."

Some of these contacts include admissions to hospitals for physical and mental health conditions, injury and intentional self-harm. This study aims to establish and quantify the risks of suicide following hospital admission for a range of mental and physical illnesses.A retrospective analysis was carried out on existing morbidity and mortality data in Victoria. Data was extracted from the Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset and the Victorian Suicide Register. Unplanned hospital admissions among adult patients (> = 15 years of age), discharged between 01 January 2011 and 31 December 2016 (2,430,154 admissions), were selected. Standardised Mortality Ratios were calculated for conditions with at least five linked suicides within one year of discharge from hospital.Forty-three conditions defined at the three-digit level of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision, were associated with at least five subsequent suicides (within one year of hospital discharge); 14 physical illnesses, 5 symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, 12 mental health conditions, and 12 types of injury and poisonings. The highest Standardised Mortality Ratios were for poisonings (range; 27.8 to 140.0) and intentional self-harm (78.8), followed by mental health conditions (range; 15.5 to 72.9), symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings (range; 1.4 to 43.2) and physical illnesses (range; 0.7 to 4.9).Hospital admissions related to mental health conditions and injury and poisonings including self-harm were associated with a greater risk of suicide than physical conditions. Mental health conditions such as depressive episodes, personality disorders and psychotic episodes, injuries caused by intentional-self-harm and poisonings by certain types of drugs, carbon monoxide and hormones such as insulin can be prioritised for targeting suicide prevention initiatives for persons discharged from hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W4285034694,"4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE), an oxidative stress byproduct, is elevated in diabetes which decreases coronary angiogenesis, and this was rescued by the 4HNE detoxifying enzyme, aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). Adiponectin (APN), an adipocytokine, has pro-angiogenic properties and its loss of function is critical in diabetes and its complications. Coronary endothelial cell (CEC) damage is the initiating step of diabetes-mediated heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) pathogenesis. Thus, we hypothesize that ALDH2 restores 4HNE-induced downregulation of APN signaling in CECs and subsequent coronary angiogenesis in diabetic HFpEF. Treatment with disulfiram, an ALDH2 inhibitor, exacerbated 4HNE-mediated decreases in APN-induced increased coronary angiogenesis and APN-signaling cascades, whereas pretreatment with alda1, an ALDH2 activator, rescued the effect of 4HNE. We employed control mice (db/m), spontaneous type-2 diabetic mice (db/db), ALDH2*2 knock-in mutant mice with intrinsic low ALDH2 activity (AL), and diabetic mice with intrinsic low ALDH2 activity (AF) mice that were created by crossing db/db and AL mice to test our hypothesis in vivo. AF mice exhibited heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)/severe diastolic dysfunction at 6 months with a preserved systolic function compared with db/db mice as well as 3 months of their age. Decreased APN-mediated coronary angiogenesis, along with increased circulatory APN levels and decreased cardiac APN signaling (index of APN resistance) were higher in AF mice relative to db/db mice. Alda1 treatment improved APN-mediated angiogenesis in AF and db/db mice. In summary, 4HNE-induces APN resistance and a subsequent decrease in coronary angiogenesis in diabetic mouse heart which was rescued by ALDH2."
https://openalex.org/W4285042762,"In healthcare wireless medical sensor networks (HWMSNs), the medical sensor nodes are employed to collect medical data which is transmitted to doctors for diagnosis and treatment. In HWMSNs, medical data is vulnerable to various attacks through public channels. In addition, leakage of patients' information happens frequently. Hence, secure communication and privacy preservation are major concerns in HWMSNs. To solve the above issues, Zhan et al. put forward a pairing-free certificateless aggregate signature (PF-CLAS) scheme. However, according to our cryptanalysis, the malicious medical sensor node (MSNi) can generate the forged signature by replacing the public key in the PF-CLAS scheme. Hence, to address this security flaw, we design the improved PF-CLAS scheme that can achieve unforgeability, anonymity, and traceability. Since we have changed the construction of the partial private key, the improved PF-CLAS scheme can resist Type I and Type II attacks under the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm assumption. In terms of the performance evaluation, the proposed scheme outperforms related CLAS schemes, which is more suitable for HWMSNs environments."

This study aimed to examine this development from the perspective of how OA is implemented. The sample comprised 2,368 randomly selected articles published in 2013 and 2,999 published in 2018 indexed in the Web of Science. We also conducted searches in Google and Google Scholar in 2015 for articles published in 2013 and in 2020 for articles published in 2018. Selected articles were categorized as either an ""OA article,"" ""electronic subscription journal article,"" or ""not available online."" OA articles were classified into 10 implementation modes: Gold, Hybrid, Delayed, Bronze, Subject Repositories, Institutional Repositories, Personal/Institutional Websites, Academic Social Networks (ASNs), Others, and Web Aggregator. Overall, 56.5% of all sampled articles in 2013 were available for free on at least one website in 2015, while 61.7% of all sampled articles in 2018 were freely available on at least one website in 2020. Concerning implementation mode, ASNs had the highest frequency (44.4% in 2015 and 56.0% in 2020), followed by Subject Repositories (35.0% in 2015 and 39.6% in 2020) and Gold (24.1% in 2015 and 37.4% in 2020). To obtain an overview of OA implementation, we conducted principal component analysis with OA implementation mode as the variable for both 2015 and 2020. The first principal component was the axis indicating the number of overlapping OA implementations for each article in 2015 and 2020, while the second principal component was the axis orthogonal to the first, which was difficult to interpret. We identified three groups of OA implementation in each plot of the principal component scores for articles in 2015 and 2020; however, the OA implementation of each group differed in 2015 and 2020. This diversity reflects the respective positions of various stakeholders regarding OA."

It has long been questioned whether athletes have an advantage when learning new whole-body motor sequences. In a previous study, we did not find any superior learning or transfer effects of strength and endurance athletes in a complex whole-body serial reaction time task (CWB-SRTT). In the present study, we aimed to extend this research by increasing the overlap of task requirements between CWB-SRTT and a specific sports discipline. For this purpose, we assessed differences between football players and non-athletes during motor sequence learning using CWB-SRTT. 15 non-athletes (CG) and 16 football players (FG) performed the CWB-SRTT over 2 days separated by one week. Median reaction times and movement times were analyzed as well as differences in sequence-specific CWB-SRTT learning rates and retention. Our findings did not reveal any differences in sequence-specific or non-sequence-specific improvement, nor retention rates between CG and FG. We speculate that this might relate to a predominately cognitive-induced learning effect during CWB-SRTT which negates the assumed motor advantage of the football players."
https://openalex.org/W4285006883,"Vesicle-mediated transport is necessary for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper signaling. The synaptosome-associated protein 23 (SNAP23) is a member of the SNARE protein family and mediates the vesicle docking and membrane fusion steps of secretion during exocytosis. Skeletal muscle has been established as a secretory organ; however, the role of SNAP23 in the context of skeletal muscle development is still unknown. Here, we show that depletion of SNAP23 in C2C12 mouse myoblasts reduces their ability to differentiate into myotubes as a result of premature cell cycle exit and early activation of the myogenic transcriptional program. This effect is rescued when cells are seeded at a high density or when cultured in conditioned medium from wild type cells. Proteomic analysis of collected medium indicates that SNAP23 depletion leads to a misregulation of exocytosis, including decreased secretion of the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), a critical protein for muscle growth, development, and function. We further demonstrate that treatment of SNAP23-depleted cells with exogenous IGF1 rescues their myogenic capacity. We propose that SNAP23 mediates the secretion of specific proteins, such as IGF1, that are important for achieving proper differentiation of skeletal muscle cells during myogenesis. This work highlights the underappreciated role of skeletal muscle as a secretory organ and contributes to the understanding of factors necessary for myogenesis."

Through the Quebec health insurance database, people living with human immunodeficiency virus on antiretroviral therapy for ≥6 months from January 2006 to June 2012 were categorized by their comorbidity status using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes, and controls without human immunodeficiency virus diagnosis or antiretroviral therapy use were age and gender matched. We compared healthcare utilization and costs. A total of 3,905 people living with human immunodeficiency virus and 11,715 control individuals were included. The mean age of people living with human immunodeficiency virus was 45.3 years and 77.3% were men. Prevalence of comorbidities was higher and occurred earlier in people living with human immunodeficiency virus and increased with older age regardless of human immunodeficiency virus status. Interestingly, bone comorbidity was high (37%) and 5-fold greater in people living with human immunodeficiency virus &lt;20 years than the controls. Polypharmacy and comorbidity scores were greater in people living with human immunodeficiency virus than controls (p&lt;0.01), as were cardiovascular, bone and renal comorbidities (40.3%, 26.0% and 5.5%, respectively; p&lt;0.01). People living with human immunodeficiency virus had higher healthcare utilization and costs than controls largely due to longer hospital stays and prescriptions. Mean total healthcare cost/person/year for people living with human immunodeficiency virus was CAD$6,248 and was highest for those with renal disease (CAD$19,617). Comorbidities in people living with human immunodeficiency virus are more prevalent, occur earlier and incur a higher burden on the healthcare system; earlier screening and improved preventative and management strategies may reduce the burden to people living with human immunodeficiency virus and to the healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W4285010878,"The distribution pattern of the microbial community in mountains is an important component of biodiversity research. Many environmental factors vary significantly with elevation on a relatively small scale in subalpine and alpine environments. These factors may markedly affect microbial community composition and function. In this study, we analyzed phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and phosphorus (P) fractions in soils from 9 sites along an elevation gradient (3500-4100 m above sea level (a.s.l.)) of the Shergyla Mountain, Tibet in China. Many biomarker PLFAs indicated that there were biogeochemical trends of the microbial distribution patterns of some soil microorganisms, which were most often increasing, U-shaped and unimodal trends along the elevation gradient. A redundancy analysis (RDA) and correlations indicated that P factors (e.g., Resin-Pi, NaHCO3-Pi and NaHCO3-Po) were more important in controlling the microbial PLFA distribution pattern than other factors (e.g., MAT, MAP, pH, TOC, TN and soil moisture) in this study area. Microorganisms are strongly associated with P fractions. Our results suggested that microbial communities were subjected to P stresses and that the distribution patterns of microbial communities were shaped by bioavailable P along the elevation gradient. Our work also hints that P geochemical processes drive the microbial diversity of the Shergyla Mountains."

Whole-body vibration (WBV) training is known to enhance voluntary activation and coordination in healthy people. However, evidence about beneficial effects of WBV in MS patients is scarce. The current study aimed to investigate if six weeks of WBV enhances motor function in the ankle joint, coordination and quality of life in patients suffering from severe MS. In a longitudinal design, changes in motor function and quality of life were assessed before and after a 6-week control period without a training (CON) and a 6-week WBV training (2-3x/week) in 15 patients (53 ±10 years) with advanced MS (EDSS 3-6.5). Before CON (t0), after CON (t1) and after WBV(t2), outcome measures included (1) active range of motion (aROM) and (2) motor accuracy at the ankle joint, (3) functional mobility (Timed ""Up & Go"" test with preferred and non-preferred turns) and (4) physical and psychological impact of MS (MSIS-29 questionnaire). For (1) and (2), the stronger (SL) and the weaker leg (WL) were compared. After WBV, aROM (1) did not change (SL p = 0.26, WL p = 0.10), but was diminished after CON (SL -10% p = 0.06, WL -14% p = 0.03) with significant group differences (Δgroup WL p = 0.02). Motor accuracy in SL (2) was improved during dorsal flexion after WBV (p = 0.01, Δgroup p = 0.04) and deteriorated during plantar flexion after CON (p = 0.01, Δgroup p = 0.04). Additionally, participants (3) improved their functional mobility at the preferred turn (p = 0.04) and (4) ranked their quality of life higher solely after WBV (p = 0.05), without any differences between groups. However, values correlated significantly between angular precision and aROM as well as functional mobility. No further changes occurred. The results point towards an interception of degenerating mono-articular mobility and improvement of accuracy in the ankle joint. The motor effects after WBV are in line with enhanced perception of quality of life after six weeks which is why WBV could be a stimulus to enable greater overall autonomy in MS patients."
https://openalex.org/W4285012049,"Among increasing eye diseases, glaucoma may hurt the optic nerves and lead to vision loss, the treatment of which is to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP). In this research, we introduce a new concept of the surgery simulator for Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS). The concept is comprised of an anterior eye model and a fluidic circulatory system. The model made of flexible material includes a channel like the Schlemm's canal (SC) and a membrane like the trabecular meshwork (TM) covering the SC. The system can monitor IOP in the model by a pressure sensor. In one of the MIGS procedures, the TM is cleaved to reduce the IOP. Using the simulator, ophthalmologists can practice the procedure and measure the IOP. First, considering the characteristics of human eyes, we defined requirements and target performances for the simulator. Next, we designed and manufactured the prototype. Using the prototype, we measured the IOP change before and after cleaving the TM. Finally, we demonstrated the availability by comparing experimental results and target performances. This simulator is also expected to be used for evaluations and developments of new MIGS instruments and ophthalmic surgery robots in addition to the surgical training of ophthalmologists."

While this phenomenon has been exhaustively studied in Europe, with repeated attempts to model the speed of Neolithic diffusion based on radiocarbon dates, much less attention has been devoted to the dispersal towards the East, and in particular to South Asia. The Neolithic in the latter region at least partly derived from southwest Asia, given the presence of ""founder crops"" such as wheat and barley. The process of their eastward diffusion, however, may have been significantly different to the westward dispersal, which was mainly due to demic diffusion, as local domesticates were already available and farming was already practiced in parts of South Asia. Here, we use radiocarbon dates specifically related to the spread of the southwest Asian Neolithic crops to model the speed of dispersal of this agricultural package towards South Asia. To assess potential geographical and environmental effects on the dispersal, we simulate different speeds depending on the biomes being crossed, employing a genetic algorithm to search for the values that most closely approach the radiocarbon dates. We find that the most important barrier to be crossed were the Zagros mountains, where the speed was lowest, possibly due to topography and climate. A large portion of the study area is dominated by deserts and shrublands, where the speed of advance, albeit closer to the range expected for demic diffusion, was lower than observed in Europe, which can also potentially be attributed to environmental constraints in the adaptation of the crops. Finally, a notable acceleration begins in the Indus valley, exceeding the range of demic diffusion in the tropical and subtropical environments east of the Indus. We propose that the latter is due to the rapid diffusion among populations already familiar with plant cultivation."
https://openalex.org/W4285014383,"While the safety and efficacy of inhaled budesonide-formoterol, used as-needed for symptoms, has been established for patients with asthma, it has not been trialed in undifferentiated patients with chronic respiratory diseases. We aimed to assess the feasibility of a pragmatic intervention that entails a stepped algorithm using inhaled budesonide-formoterol (dry powder inhaler, 160μg/4.5μg per dose) for patients presenting with chronic respiratory diseases to three rural district hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam.We recruited patients with evidence of airflow obstruction on spirometry and/or symptoms consistent with asthma. The algorithm consisted of three steps: 1. as-needed inhaled budesonide-formoterol for symptoms, 2. maintenance plus as-needed inhaled budesonide-formoterol, and 3. referral to a higher-level healthcare facility. All participants started at step 1, with escalation to the next step at review visits if there had been exacerbation(s) or inadequate symptom control. Patients were followed for 12 months.Among 313 participants who started the treatment algorithm, 47.2% had ≥ 1 episode of acute respiratory symptoms requiring a visit to hospital or clinic and 35.4% were diagnosed with an exacerbation. Twelve months after enrolment, 50.7% still adhered to inhaled budesonide-formoterol at the recommended treatment step. The mean and median number of doses per day was 1.5 (standard deviation 1.2) doses and 1.3 (interquartile range 0.7-2.3) doses, respectively. The proportion of patients taking more than 800μg budesonide per day was 3.8%.This novel therapeutic algorithm is feasible for patients with chronic respiratory diseases in a rural setting in Vietnam. Further studies are required to establish the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of similar approaches in different settings.ACTRN12619000554167."
