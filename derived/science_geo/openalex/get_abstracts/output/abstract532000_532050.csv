https://openalex.org/W1935339094,"Neuronal diversity is essential for mammalian brain function but poses a challenge to molecular profiling. To address the need for tools that facilitate cell-type-specific epigenomic studies, we developed the first affinity purification approach to isolate nuclei from genetically defined cell types in a mammal. We combine this technique with next-generation sequencing to show that three subtypes of neocortical neurons have highly distinctive epigenomic landscapes. Over 200,000 regions differ in chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation signatures characteristic of gene regulatory regions. By footprinting and motif analyses, these regions are predicted to bind distinct cohorts of neuron subtype-specific transcription factors. Neuronal epigenomes reflect both past and present gene expression, with DNA hyper-methylation at developmentally critical genes appearing as a novel epigenomic signature in mature neurons. Taken together, our findings link the functional and transcriptional complexity of neurons to their underlying epigenomic diversity."

A potential successful vaccine design might protect by eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), which target specific regions on HIV-1's trimeric envelope glycoprotein (Env) (see the Perspective by Mascola). Jardine et al. used mice engineered to express germline-reverted heavy chains of a particular bNAb and immunized them with an Env-based immunogen designed to bind to precursors of that bNAb. Sanders et al. compared rabbits and monkeys immunized with Env trimers that adopt a nativelike conformation. In both cases, immunized animals produced antibodies that shared similarities with bNAbs. Boosting these animals with other immunogens may drive these antibodies to further mutate into the longsought bNAbs. Chen et al. report that retaining the cytoplasmic domain of Env proteins may be important to attract bNAbs. Removing the cytoplasmic domain may distract the immune response and instead generate antibodies that target epitopes on Env that would not lead to protection.

https://openalex.org/W1691917253,"Saharan silver ants, Cataglyphis bombycina, forage under extreme temperature conditions in the African desert. We show that the ants' conspicuous silvery appearance is created by a dense array of triangular hairs with two thermoregulatory effects. They enhance not only the reflectivity of the ant's body surface in the visible and near-infrared range of the spectrum, where solar radiation culminates, but also the emissivity of the ant in the mid-infrared. The latter effect enables the animals to efficiently dissipate heat back to the surroundings via blackbody radiation under full daylight conditions. This biological solution for a thermoregulatory problem may lead to the development of biomimetic coatings for passive radiative cooling of objects."

The long noncoding Xist RNA plays a role in this process. To understand how a whole chromosome can be stably inactivated, Minajigi et al. identified many of the proteins that bind to the Xist RNA, which include cohesins. Paradoxically, the interaction between Xist and cohesin subunits resulted in repulsion of cohesin complexes from the inactive X chromosome, changing the three-dimensional shape of the whole chromosome.

https://openalex.org/W1915453701,"A major goal of HIV-1 vaccine research is the design of immunogens capable of inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that bind to the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env). Poor binding of Env to unmutated precursors of bnAbs, including those of the VRC01 class, appears to be a major problem for bnAb induction. We engineered an immunogen that binds to VRC01-class bnAb precursors and immunized knock-in mice expressing germline-reverted VRC01 heavy chains. Induced antibodies showed characteristics of VRC01-class bnAbs, including a short CDRL3 (light-chain complementarity-determining region 3) and mutations that favored binding to near-native HIV-1 gp120 constructs. In contrast, native-like immunogens failed to activate VRC01-class precursors. The results suggest that rational epitope design can prime rare B cell precursors for affinity maturation to desired targets."
https://openalex.org/W2155847838,"Increasingly detailed data on the network topology of neural circuits create a need for theoretical principles that explain how these networks shape neural communication. Here we use a model of cascade spreading to reveal architectural features of human brain networks that facilitate spreading. Using an anatomical brain network derived from high-resolution diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), we investigate scenarios where perturbations initiated at seed nodes result in global cascades that interact either cooperatively or competitively. We find that hub regions and a backbone of pathways facilitate early spreading, while the shortest path structure of the connectome enables cooperative effects, accelerating the spread of cascades. Finally, competing cascades become integrated by converging on polysensory associative areas. These findings show that the organizational principles of brain networks shape global communication and facilitate integrative function."
https://openalex.org/W1588626794,"Kennewick Man, referred to as the Ancient One by Native Americans, is a male human skeleton discovered in Washington state (USA) in 1996 and initially radiocarbon dated to 8,340-9,200 calibrated years before present (BP). His population affinities have been the subject of scientific debate and legal controversy. Based on an initial study of cranial morphology it was asserted that Kennewick Man was neither Native American nor closely related to the claimant Plateau tribes of the Pacific Northwest, who claimed ancestral relationship and requested repatriation under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). The morphological analysis was important to judicial decisions that Kennewick Man was not Native American and that therefore NAGPRA did not apply. Instead of repatriation, additional studies of the remains were permitted. Subsequent craniometric analysis affirmed Kennewick Man to be more closely related to circumpacific groups such as the Ainu and Polynesians than he is to modern Native Americans. In order to resolve Kennewick Man's ancestry and affiliations, we have sequenced his genome to ∼1× coverage and compared it to worldwide genomic data including for the Ainu and Polynesians. We find that Kennewick Man is closer to modern Native Americans than to any other population worldwide. Among the Native American groups for whom genome-wide data are available for comparison, several seem to be descended from a population closely related to that of Kennewick Man, including the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Colville), one of the five tribes claiming Kennewick Man. We revisit the cranial analyses and find that, as opposed to genome-wide comparisons, it is not possible on that basis to affiliate Kennewick Man to specific contemporary groups. We therefore conclude based on genetic comparisons that Kennewick Man shows continuity with Native North Americans over at least the last eight millennia."

The underground and covert nature of poaching makes it difficult to police. Wasser et al. used genetic tools to identify the origins of elephant tusks seized during transit (see the Perspective by Hoelzel). The majority of source animals were part of just a few wild elephant populations in Africa—and just two areas since 2006. Increased focus on enforcement in a few such areas could help interrupt poaching activities and restore wild elephant populations. Science , this issue p. 84 ; see also p. 34"
https://openalex.org/W1270239926,"Subjects with incidental Lewy body disease (iLBD) may represent the premotor stage of Parkinson's disease (PD). To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal dysfunction and alpha-synuclein pathology in the premotor phase of PD, we investigated the transcriptome of the substantia nigra (SN) of well-characterized iLBD, PD donors and age-matched controls with Braak alpha-synuclein stage ranging from 0-6. In Braak alpha-synuclein stages 1 and 2, we observed deregulation of pathways linked to axonal degeneration, immune response and endocytosis, including axonal guidance signaling, mTOR signaling, EIF2 signaling and clathrin-mediated endocytosis in the SN. In Braak stages 3 and 4, we observed deregulation of pathways involved in protein translation and cell survival, including mTOR and EIF2 signaling. In Braak stages 5 and 6, we observed deregulation of dopaminergic signaling, axonal guidance signaling and thrombin signaling. Throughout the progression of PD pathology, we observed a deregulation of mTOR, EIF2 and regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K signaling in the SN. Our results indicate that molecular mechanisms related to axonal dysfunction, endocytosis and immune response are an early event in PD pathology, whereas mTOR and EIF2 signaling are impaired throughout disease progression. These pathways may hold the key to altering the disease progression in PD."
https://openalex.org/W1847960242,"α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play an important role in synaptic transmission and inflammation. In response to ligands, this receptor channel opens to conduct cations into the cell but desensitizes rapidly. In recent studies we show that α7 nAChRs bind signaling proteins such as heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). Here, we demonstrate that direct coupling of α7 nAChRs to G proteins enables a downstream calcium signaling response that can persist beyond the expected time course of channel activation. This process depends on a G protein-binding cluster (GPBC) in the M3-M4 loop of the receptor. A mutation of the GPBC in the α7 nAChR (α7345–348A) abolishes interaction with Gαq as well as Gβγ while having no effect on receptor synthesis, cell-surface trafficking, or α-bungarotoxin binding. Expression of α7345–348A, however, did significantly attenuate the α7 nAChR-induced Gαq calcium signaling response as evidenced by a decrease in PLC-β activation and IP3R-mediated calcium store release in the presence of the α7 selective agonist choline. Taken together, the data provides new evidence for the existence of a GPBC in nAChRs serving to promote intracellular signaling. α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play an important role in synaptic transmission and inflammation.

In most cell types, co-expression of ionotropic nAChRs as well as metabotropic muscarinic receptors ensures a fast and slow acetylcholine signaling response, respectively. At least nine different nAChR subunits are expressed in the mammalian brain. In the hippocampus and cortex homomeric α7 and heteromeric α4β2 nAChRs have been shown to contribute to neurotransmitter release and dendritic plasticity (2Halff A.W. Gómez-Varela D. John D.

A mutation at the GPBC in the human GlyR1 is sufficient to abolish G protein binding in HEK 293 cells (13Yevenes G.E. Moraga-Cid G. Guzmán L. Haeger S. Oliveira L. Olate J. Schmalzing G. Aguayo L.G.

A protein sequence alignment of the M3-M4 loop reveals a conservation of the GPBC in the α7 nAChR. A mutation of these residues in α7 nAChRs attenuates interaction with G proteins and reduces the capacity of the receptor to activate phospholipase C (PLC) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) calcium release in response to choline. These findings show a role for G protein coupling in α7 nAChR signaling. Male and female C57BL/6 adult mice (Jackson) were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum.

Proteins were eluted in LDS buffer (Life Technologies), separated onto BisTris gradient gels, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). HRP secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Bands were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific) via the Gel Doc Imaging system (Bio-Rad). SeeBlue Ladder (Life Technologies) was used as a protein standard. Presented values are based on averages from three independent experiments.

We surveyed α7 nAChR associations with G proteins in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of the mouse brain. α7 nAChR-specific antibodies were used to co-IP α7 along with G proteins from neural membranes fractions. A reverse co-IP experiment was performed using anti-G protein antibodies to detect α7 nAChRs in the same membrane fraction. Co-IP experiments were also performed from α7 knock-out mice (α7−/−) as a negative control (29Orr-Urtreger A. Göldner F.M. Saeki M. Lorenzo I. Goldberg L. De Biasi M. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9165-9171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, α7 nAChRs were found in association with Gαs, Gαq, and Gαi proteins within the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Striatal fractions suggest α7 interaction with Gαq and Gαi subunits (Fig. 1A). Comparable levels of Gαs, Gαq, and Gαi protein expression was seen on a Western blot in the three-brain structures (data not shown). An association between α7 nAChRs and Gβ was observed in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, whereas little to no detection of Gαo was seen in the adult brain (Fig. 1A). Complementary experiments in which the anti-α7 antibody C-20 was used to co-IP Gαq and Gβ from the hippocampus confirmed association between the α7 nAChR and these G proteins (Fig. 1A). α-Bgtx is a selective antagonist of the α7 nAChR. We determined subtypes of G proteins that associated with a BgtxC matrix from the mouse brain using tissue from α7−/− as a negative control. This purification method enabled us to examine G proteins that interact with nAChRs (24Paulo J.A. Brucker W.J. Hawrot E. Proteomic analysis of an α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor interactome.J. Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 1849-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Western blotting confirmed expression of α7 subunits within the BgtxC fraction (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, SDS-PAGE fractionation of the BgtxC indicates greater specificity and stronger yield when the nicotinic agonist, carbachol, is used to elute from the Bgtx matrix. Gel lanes of the BgtxC were divided into 3 molecular mass fractions: F1, 190-90 kDa; F2, 89-45 kDa; and F3, 44-15 kDa (Fig. 1C). Proteomic analysis was performed on the individual fractions using tryptic in-gel digestion followed by high-performance LC-ESI. A cohort of G proteins was identified in the F2 and F3 fractions (Fig. 1D). These G proteins were not detected in BgtxC from α7−/− mice (data not shown). We examined the existence of a G prot"
https://openalex.org/W1543674079,"Normalization has been proposed as a canonical computation that accounts for a variety of nonlinear neuronal response properties associated with sensory processing and higher cognitive functions. A key premise of normalization is that the excitability of a neuron is inversely proportional to the overall activity level of the network. We tested this by optogenetically activating excitatory neurons in alert macaque primary visual cortex and measuring changes in neuronal activity as a function of stimulation intensity, with or without variable-contrast visual stimulation. Optogenetic depolarization of excitatory neurons either facilitated or suppressed baseline activity, consistent with indirect recruitment of inhibitory networks. As predicted by the normalization model, neurons exhibited sub-additive responses to optogenetic and visual stimulation, which depended lawfully on stimulation intensity and luminance contrast. We conclude that the normalization computation persists even under the artificial conditions of optogenetic stimulation, underscoring the canonical nature of this form of neural computation."
https://openalex.org/W1566539102,"To study rapid sensorimotor remapping, we developed a method to train rats in a behavior in which subjects are cued, on each trial, to apply a sensorimotor association to orient either toward a visual target (""Pro"") or away from it, toward its reverse (""Anti""). Multiple behavioral asymmetries suggested that Anti behavior is cognitively demanding while Pro is easier to learn and perform. This is consistent with a prominent hypothesis in the primate literature that Anti requires prefrontal cortex (PFC), whereas Pro could be mediated by midbrain superior colliculus (SC). Pharmacological inactivation of rat medial PFC supported its expected role in Anti. Remarkably, bilateral SC inactivation substantially impaired Anti while leaving Pro essentially intact. Moreover, SC inactivation eliminated the performance cost of switching from Anti to Pro tasks. Our results establish a rodent model of single-trial sensorimotor remapping and suggest a critical role for SC in the cognitively demanding Anti task."
https://openalex.org/W1574677314,"We quantify mechanical processes common to soil penetration by earthworms and growing plant roots, including the energetic requirements for soil plastic displacement. The basic mechanical model considers cavity expansion into a plastic wet soil involving wedging by root tips or earthworms via cone-like penetration followed by cavity expansion due to pressurized earthworm hydroskeleton or root radial growth. The mechanical stresses and resulting soil strains determine the mechanical energy required for bioturbation under different soil hydro-mechanical conditions for a realistic range of root/earthworm geometries. Modeling results suggest that higher soil water content and reduced clay content reduce the strain energy required for soil penetration. The critical earthworm or root pressure increases with increased diameter of root or earthworm, however, results are insensitive to the cone apex (shape of the tip). The invested mechanical energy per unit length increase with increasing earthworm and plant root diameters, whereas mechanical energy per unit of displaced soil volume decreases with larger diameters. The study provides a quantitative framework for estimating energy requirements for soil penetration work done by earthworms and plant roots, and delineates intrinsic and external mechanical limits for bioturbation processes. Estimated energy requirements for earthworm biopore networks are linked to consumption of soil organic matter and suggest that earthworm populations are likely to consume a significant fraction of ecosystem net primary production to sustain their subterranean activities."
https://openalex.org/W2168885952,"Surfactant protein B (SP-B), from the saposin-like family of proteins, is essential to facilitate the formation and proper performance of surface active films at the air-liquid interface of mammalian lungs, and lack of or deficiency in this protein is associated with lethal respiratory failure. Despite its importance, neither a structural model nor a molecular mechanism of SP-B is available. The purpose of the present work was to purify and characterize native SP-B supramolecular assemblies to provide a model supporting structure-function features described for SP-B. Purification of porcine SP-B using detergent-solubilized surfactant reveals the presence of 10 nm ring-shaped particles. These rings, observed by atomic force and electron microscopy, would be assembled by oligomerization of SP-B as a multimer of dimers forming a hydrophobically coated ring at the surface of phospholipid membranes or monolayers. Docking of rings from neighboring membranes would lead to formation of SP-B-based hydrophobic tubes, competent to facilitate the rapid flow of surface active lipids both between membranes and between surfactant membranes and the interface. A similar sequential assembly of dimers, supradimeric oligomers and phospholipid-loaded tubes could explain the activity of other saposins with colipase, cytolysin, or antibiotic activities, offering a common framework to understand the range of functions carried out by saposins."
https://openalex.org/W560708904,"Fishing and pollution are chronic stressors that can prolong recovery of coral reefs and contribute to ecosystem decline. While this premise is generally accepted, management interventions are complicated because the contributions from individual stressors are difficult to distinguish. The present study examined the extent to which fishing pressure and pollution predicted progress towards the Micronesia Challenge, an international conservation strategy initiated by the political leaders of 6 nations to conserve at least 30% of marine resources by 2020. The analyses were rooted in a defined measure of coral-reef-ecosystem condition, comprised of biological metrics that described functional processes on coral reefs. We report that only 42% of the major reef habitats exceeded the ecosystem-condition threshold established by the Micronesia Challenge. Fishing pressure acting alone on outer reefs, or in combination with pollution in some lagoons, best predicted both the decline and variance in ecosystem condition. High variances among ecosystem-condition scores reflected the large gaps between the best and worst reefs, and suggested that the current scores were unlikely to remain stable through time because of low redundancy. Accounting for the presence of marine protected area (MPA) networks in statistical models did little to improve the models' predictive capabilities, suggesting limited efficacy of MPAs when grouped together across the region. Yet, localized benefits of MPAs existed and are expected to increase over time. Sensitivity analyses suggested that (i) grazing by large herbivores, (ii) high functional diversity of herbivores, and (iii) high predator biomass were most sensitive to fishing pressure, and were required for high ecosystem-condition scores. Linking comprehensive fisheries management policies with these sensitive metrics, and targeting the management of pollution, will strengthen the Micronesia Challenge and preserve ecosystem services that coral reefs provide to societies in the face of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2100393961,"The development of dual targeting antibodies promises therapies with improved efficacy over mono-specific antibodies. Here, we engineered a Two-in-One VEGF/angiopoietin 2 antibody with dual action Fab (DAF) as a potential therapeutic for neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Crystal structures of the VEGF/angiopoietin 2 DAF in complex with its two antigens showed highly overlapping binding sites. To achieve sufficient affinity of the DAF to block both angiogenic factors, we turned to deep mutational scanning in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). By mutating all three CDRs of each antibody chain simultaneously, we were able not only to identify affinity improving single mutations but also mutation pairs from different CDRs that synergistically improve both binding functions. Furthermore, insights into the cooperativity between mutations allowed us to identify fold-stabilizing mutations in the CDRs. The data obtained from deep mutational scanning reveal that the majority of the 52 CDR residues are utilized differently for the two antigen binding function and permit, for the first time, the engineering of several DAF variants with sub-nanomolar affinity against two structurally unrelated antigens. The improved variants show similar blocking activity of receptor binding as the high affinity mono-specific antibodies against these two proteins, demonstrating the feasibility of generating a dual specificity binding surface with comparable properties to individual high affinity mono-specific antibodies."

The capacity of the mixed agents to solubilize lindane, lead and cadmium in aqueous solution was also explored. The results showed that the presence of citric acid greatly enhanced the solubilization of lindane and cadmium by rhamnolipids. A combined effect of the mixed agents on lindane and heavy metals removal from soils was observed. The maximum desorption ratios for lindane, cadmium and lead were 85.4%, 76.4% and 28.1%, respectively, for the mixed agents containing 1% rhamnolipidsand 0.1 mol/L citric acid. The results also suggest that the removal efficiencies of lead and cadmium were strongly related to their speciations in soils, and metals in the exchangeable and carbonate forms were easier to be removed. Our study suggests that the combining use of rhamnolipids and citric acid is a promising alternative to simultaneously remove organochlorine pesticides and heavy metals from soils."

The aim of this research was to study the association between BMI and HRQL in Chinese adults, and to further explore the stability of that association in the subgroup analysis stratified by status of chronic conditions.A total of 21,218 adults aged 18 and older were classified as underweight, normal weight, overweight, class I obese, and class II obese based on their BMI. HRQL was measured by the SF-36 Health Survey. The independent impact of each BMI category on HRQL was examined through standard least squares regression by comparing the difference of SF-36 scores and the minimum clinically important differences (MCID), which was defined as 3 points.Compared to the normal weight, the class I obese was significantly associated with better HRQL scores in the mental component summary (MCS) (75.1 vs. 73.4, P<0.001). The underweight had the lowest score in both the physical components summary (PCS) (75.4 vs. 77.5, P<0.001) and mental components summary (MCS) (71.8 vs. 73.4, P<0.001). For the MCID, the HRQL score was reduced by more than 3 points in the physical functioning for the class II obese (D=-3.43) and the general health for the underweight (D=-3.71). Stratified analyses showed a similar result in the health subjects and chronic conditions, and it was significant in the chronic conditions.The class I obese showed the best HRQL, especially in the mental domain. The worst HRQL was found in the underweight. The class II obese reduced HRQL in the physical functioning only. ""Obesity paradox"" was more obvious in the participants with chronic conditions."

A variety of parameters of B cell activity including activation, differentiation, cytokine productions and proliferation were monitored by flow cytometry. SRL at clinically relevant concentrations (6 ng/ml) profoundly inhibited CD19(+ )B cell proliferation compared to controls whereas TAC at similar concentrations had a minimal effect.

SRL effectively blocked B cell differentiation into plasma cells (CD19(+)CD138(+) and Blimp1(+)/Pax5(low) cells) even at low dose (2 ng/ml), and totally eliminated them at 6 ng/ml. SRL decreased absolute B cell counts, but the residual responding cells acquired an activated phenotype (CD25(+)/CD69(+)) and increased the expression of HLA-DR. SRL-treated stimulated B cells on a per cell basis were able to enhance the proliferation of allogeneic CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells and induce a shift toward the Th1 phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W634224072,"Background A recent study showed improved performance of the P300-speller when the flashing row or column was overlaid with translucent pictures of familiar faces (FF spelling paradigm). However, the performance of the P300-speller is not yet satisfactory due to its low classification accuracy and information transfer rate. Objective To investigate whether P300-speller performance is further improved when the chromatic property and the FF spelling paradigm are combined. Methods We proposed a new spelling paradigm in which the flashing row or column is overlaid with translucent green pictures of familiar faces (GFF spelling paradigm). We analyzed the ERP waveforms elicited by the FF and proposed GFF spelling paradigms and compared P300-speller performance between the two paradigms. Results Significant differences in the amplitudes of four ERP components (N170, VPP, P300, and P600f) were observed between both spelling paradigms. Compared to the FF spelling paradigm, the GFF spelling paradigm elicited ERP waveforms of higher amplitudes and resulted in improved P300-speller performance. Conclusions Combining the chromatic property (green color) and the FF spelling paradigm led to better classification accuracy and an increased information transfer rate. These findings demonstrate a promising new approach for improving the performance of the P300-speller."

We used genetic analyses to sex and individually identify birds. We estimated sex-dependent detection probabilities and population size using a modern spatial capture-recapture (SCR) model for the data from pooled surveys. A total of 127 capercaillie genotypes were identified (77 males, 46 females, and 4 of unknown sex). The SCR model yielded a total population size estimate (posterior mean) of 137.3 capercaillies (posterior sd 4.2, 95% CRI 130-147). The observed sex ratio was skewed towards males (0.63). The posterior mean of the sex ratio under the SCR model was 0.58 (posterior sd 0.02, 95% CRI 0.54-0.61), suggesting a male-biased sex ratio in our study area. A subsampling simulation study indicated that a reduced sampling effort representing 75% of the actual detections would still yield practically acceptable estimates of total size and sex ratio in our population. Hence, field work and financial effort could be reduced without compromising accuracy when the SCR model is used to estimate key population parameters of cryptic species."

Here, we demonstrate that GR and KLF15 physically interact and identify low affinity GR binding sites within glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) for PRODH and AASS that contribute to combinatorial regulation with KLF15. We used deep sequencing and electrophoretic mobility shift assays to derive in vitro GR binding affinities across sequence space. We applied these data to show that AASS GRE activity correlated (r2 = 0.73) with predicted GR binding affinities across a 50-fold affinity range in transfection assays; however, the slope of the linear relationship more than doubled when KLF15 was expressed. Whereas activity of the MT2A GRE was even more strongly (r2 = 0.89) correlated with GR binding site affinity, the slope of the linear relationship was sharply reduced by KLF15, consistent with incoherent FFL logic. Thus, GRE architecture and co-regulator expression together determine the functional parameters that relate GR binding site affinity to hormone-induced transcriptional responses.

https://openalex.org/W635225177,"Candida albicans is a major human fungal pathogen. One of the important features of C. albicans pathogenicity is the ability to form biofilms on mucosal surfaces and indwelling medical devices. Biofilm formation involves complex processes in C. albicans, including cell adhesion, filamentous growth, extracellular matrix secretion and cell dispersion. In this work, we characterized the role of the transcription factor Sfp1, particularly with respect to its function in the regulation of biofilm formation. The deletion of the SFP1 gene enhanced cell adhesion and biofilm formation in comparison to the wild-type strain. Interestingly, the sfp1-deleted mutant also exhibited an increase in the expression of the ALS1, ALS3 and HWP1 genes, which encode adhesin proteins. In addition, Sfp1 was demonstrated to function downstream of the Rhb1-TOR signaling pathway. Bcr1 and Efg1 are transcription factors that are critical for controlling biofilm formation, and Efg1 is also required for hyphal growth. Deleting either the BCR1 or EFG1 gene in the sfp1-null background led to reduced adhesin gene expression. As a result, the bcr1/sfp1 or efg1/sfp1 double deletion mutants exhibited dramatically reduced biofilm formation. The results indicated that Sfp1 negatively regulates the ALS1, ALS3 and HWP1 adhesin genes and that the repression of these genes is mediated by the inhibition of Bcr1 and Efg1."

In vivo electrophysiology using atrial burst pacing revealed that mice with global RGS4 deletion developed AF more frequently than control littermates. Isolated atrial cells from RGS4−/− mice show an increase in Ca2+ spark frequency under basal conditions and after the addition of endothelin-1 and abnormal spontaneous Ca2+ release events after field stimulation. Isolated left atria studied on a multielectrode array revealed modest changes in path length for re-entry but abnormal electrical events after a pacing train in RGS4−/− mice.

Isolated atrial cells from RGS4−/− mice show an increase in Ca2+ spark frequency under basal conditions and after the addition of endothelin-1 and abnormal spontaneous Ca2+ release events after field stimulation. Isolated left atria studied on a multielectrode array revealed modest changes in path length for re-entry but abnormal electrical events after a pacing train in RGS4−/− mice. RGS4 deletion results in a predisposition to atrial fibrillation from enhanced activity in the Gαq/11-IP3 pathway, resulting in abnormal Ca2+ release and corresponding electrical events."

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is one of the earliest embryo-derived secreted signals in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that abundantly expresses hCG receptors. The aims of this study were to estimate the effect of human embryo-secreted hCG on PBMC function and investigate the role and underlying mechanisms of activated PBMC in trophoblast invasion. Blood samples were collected from women undergoing benign gynecological surgery during the mid-secretory phase. PBMC were isolated and stimulated with or without hCG for 0 or 24 h. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expressions in PBMC were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The JAR cell line served as a model for trophoblast cells and was divided into four groups: control, hCG only, PBMC only, and PBMC with hCG. JAR cell invasive and proliferative abilities were detected by trans-well and CCK8 assays and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, and TIMP-2 expressions in JAR cells were detected by western blotting and real-time PCR analysis. We found that hCG can remarkably promote IL-1β and LIF promotion in PBMC after 24-h culture. PBMC activated by hCG significantly increased the number of invasive JAR cells in an invasion assay without affecting proliferation, and hCG-activated PBMC significantly increased MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF and decreased TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expressions in JAR cells in a dose-dependent manner. This study demonstrated that hCG stimulates cytokine secretion in human PBMC and could stimulate trophoblast invasion."

The exposed part of the trimer, gp140, consists of two noncovalently associated subunits, gp120 and gp41 ectodomain. A recombinant vaccine that mimics the native trimer might elicit entry-blocking antibodies and prevent virus infection. However, preparation of authentic HIV-1 trimers has been challenging. Recently, an affinity column containing the broadly neutralizing antibody 2G12 has been used to capture recombinant gp140 and prepare trimers from clade A BG505 that naturally produces stable trimers. However, this antibody-based approach may not be as effective for the diverse HIV-1 strains with different epitope signatures. Here, we report a new and simple approach to produce HIV-1 envelope trimers. The C terminus of gp140 was attached to Strep-tag II with a long linker separating the tag from the massive trimer base and glycan shield. This allowed capture of nearly homogeneous gp140 directly from the culture medium. Cleaved, uncleaved, and fully or partially glycosylated trimers from different clade viruses were produced. Extensive biochemical characterizations showed that cleavage of gp140 was not essential for trimerization, but it triggered a conformational change that channels trimers into correct glycosylation pathways, generating compact three-blade propeller-shaped trimers. Uncleaved trimers entered aberrant pathways, resulting in hyperglycosylation, nonspecific cross-linking, and conformational heterogeneity. Even the cleaved trimers showed microheterogeneity in gp41 glycosylation. These studies established a broadly applicable HIV-1 trimer production system as well as generating new insights into their assembly and maturation that collectively bear on the HIV-1 vaccine design.

https://openalex.org/W605099069,"Purpose Fibrocytes (FC) are bone marrow-derived progenitor cells that are more abundant and infiltrate the thyroid and orbit in Graves orbitopathy (GO). FCs express high levels of thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R). These receptors are physically and functionally associated, but their role in GO pathogenesis is not fully delineated. Treatment of FCs with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) or M22 (activating antibody to TSHR) induces the production of numerous cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). Teprotumumab (TMB) is a human monoclonal IGF-1R blocking antibody currently in clinical trial for GO and inhibits TSHR-mediated actions in FCs. Aim To characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying TSH-induced TNFα production by FCs, and the role of IGF-1R blockade by TMB. Design FCs from healthy and GD patients were treated with combinations of TSH, M22, MG132 and AKTi (inhibitors of NF-κB and Akt, respectively), and TMB. TNFα protein production was measured by Luminex and flow cytometry. Messenger RNA expression was quantified by real time PCR. Results Treatment with TSH/M22 induced TNFα protein and mRNA production by FCs, both of which were reduced when FCs were pretreated with MG132 and AKTi (p<0.0001). TMB decreased TSH-induced TNFα protein production in circulating FCs from mean fluorescent index (MFI) value of 2.92 to 1.91, and mRNA expression in cultured FCs from 141- to 52-fold expression (p<0.0001). TMB also decreased M22-induced TNFα protein production from MFI of 1.67 to 1.12, and mRNA expression from 6- to 3-fold expression (p<0.0001). Conclusion TSH/M22 stimulates FC production of TNFα mRNA and protein. This process involves the transcription factor NF-κB and its regulator Akt. Blocking IGF-1R attenuates TSH/M22-induced TNFα production. This further delineates the interaction of TSHR and IGF1-R signaling pathways. By modulating the proinflammatory properties of FCs such as TNFα production, TMB may be a promising therapeutic agent for GO."
https://openalex.org/W1581080082,"Listeria monocytogenes is a food and soil-borne pathogen that secretes a pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) as its major virulence factor. We tested the effects of LLO on an intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 and compared them to an unrelated pore-forming toxin equinatoxin II (EqtII). Results showed that apical application of both toxins causes a significant drop in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), with higher LLO concentrations or prolonged exposure time needed to achieve the same magnitude of response than with EqtII. The drop in TEER was due to pore formation and coincided with rearrangement of claudin-1 within tight junctions and associated actin cytoskeleton; however, no significant increase in permeability to fluorescein or 3 kDa FITC-dextran was observed. Influx of calcium after pore formation affected the magnitude of the drop in TEER. Both toxins exhibit similar effects on epithelium morphology and physiology. Importantly, LLO action upon the membrane is much slower and results in compromised epithelium on a longer time scale at lower concentrations than EqtII. This could favor listerial invasion in hosts resistant to E-cadherin related infection."
https://openalex.org/W1738502657,"The proximity of an enzyme to its substrate can influence rate and magnitude of catalysis. A-kinase anchoring protein 220 (AKAP220) is a multivalent anchoring protein that can sequester a variety of signal transduction enzymes. These include protein kinase A (PKA) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Using a combination of molecular and cellular approaches we show that GSK3β phosphorylation of Thr-1132 on AKAP220 initiates recruitment of this kinase into the enzyme scaffold. We also find that AKAP220 anchors GSK3β and its substrate β-catenin in membrane ruffles. Interestingly, GSK3β can be released from the multienzyme complex in response to PKA phosphorylation on serine 9, which suppresses GSK3β activity. The signaling scaffold may enhance this regulatory mechanism, as AKAP220 has the capacity to anchor two PKA holoenzymes. Site 1 on AKAP220 (residues 610–623) preferentially interacts with RII, whereas site 2 (residues 1633–1646) exhibits a dual specificity for RI and RII. In vitro affinity measurements revealed that site 2 on AKAP220 binds RII with ∼10-fold higher affinity than site 1.

https://openalex.org/W1937157885,"To study the effect of chronic excess growth hormone on adipose tissue, we performed RNA sequencing in adipose tissue biopsies from patients with acromegaly (n = 7) or non-functioning pituitary adenomas (n = 11). The patients underwent clinical and metabolic profiling including assessment of HOMA-IR. Explants of adipose tissue were assayed ex vivo for lipolysis and ceramide levels. Patients with acromegaly had higher glucose, higher insulin levels and higher HOMA-IR score. We observed several previously reported transcriptional changes (IGF1, IGFBP3, CISH, SOCS2) that are known to be induced by GH/IGF-1 in liver but are also induced in adipose tissue. We also identified several novel transcriptional changes, some of which may be important for GH/IGF responses (PTPN3 and PTPN4) and the effects of acromegaly on growth and proliferation. Several differentially expressed transcripts may be important in GH/IGF-1-induced metabolic changes. Specifically, induction of LPL, ABHD5, and NRIP1 can contribute to enhanced lipolysis and may explain the elevated adipose tissue lipolysis in acromegalic patients. Higher expression of TCF7L2 and the fatty acid desaturases FADS1, FADS2 and SCD could contribute to insulin resistance. Ceramides were not different between the two groups. In summary, we have identified the acromegaly gene expression signature in human adipose tissue. The significance of altered expression of specific transcripts will enhance our understanding of the metabolic and proliferative changes associated with acromegaly."

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association between social factors, including social support, and prolonged sleep difficulties (persisting over 1 month). Social support was divided into three functions: emotional, informational, and instrumental support.Data were obtained on 2,593 individuals who were living at home after the disaster.The prevalence of prolonged sleep difficulties was 6.9% (5.8% male, 7.7% female). This study showed that lack of social support has a stronger association with prolonged sleep difficulties than non-modifiable or hardly modifiable consequences caused directly by the disaster, i.e., severity of home damage, change in family structure and income. Among the three dimensions of social support, lack of emotional support showed the strongest association with prolonged sleep difficulties.Social support, especially emotional support, may positively affect sleep among victims living at home around 1-2 years after a disaster."
https://openalex.org/W1518849053,"Many of the decisions and actions in everyday life result from implicit learning processes. Important to psychopathology are, for example, implicit reward-seeking and punishment-avoidant learning processes. It is known that when specific actions get associated with a rewarding experience, such as positive emotions, that this will increase the likelihood that an organism will engage in similar actions in the future. Similarly, when actions get associated with punishing experiences, such as negative emotions, this may reduce the likelihood that the organism will engage in similar actions in the future. This study examines whether we can observe these implicit processes prospectively in the flow of daily life. If such processes take place then we expect that current behaviour can be predicted by how similar behaviour was experienced (in terms of positive and negative affect) at previous measurement moments. This was examined in a sample of 621 female individuals that had participated in an Experience Sampling data collection. Measures of affect and behaviour were collected at 10 semi-random moments of the day for 5 consecutive days. It was examined whether affective experience that was paired with certain behaviours (physical activity and social context) at previous measurements modified the likelihood to show similar behaviours at next measurement moments. Analyses were performed both at the level of observations (a time scale with units of ± 90 min) and at day level (a time scale with units of 24 h). As expected, we found that affect indeed moderated the extent to which previous behaviour predicted similar behaviour later in time, at both beep- and day-level. This study showed that it is feasible to track reward-seeking and punishment-avoidant behaviour prospectively in humans in the flow of daily life. This opens up a new toolbox to examine processes determining goal-oriented behaviour in relation to psychopathology in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2248701411,"Animal personality research is receiving increasing interest from related fields, such as evolutionary personality psychology. By merging the conceptual understanding of personality, the contributions to both fields of research may be enhanced. In this study, we investigate animal personality based on the definition of personality traits as underlying dispositional factors, which are not directly measurable, but which predispose individuals to react through different behavioural patterns. We investigated the shyness-boldness continuum reflected in the consistency of inter-individual variation in behavioural responses towards novelty in 47 farmed American mink (Neovison vison), which were raised in identical housing conditions. Different stages of approach behaviour towards novelty, and how these related within and across contexts, were explored. Our experimental design contained four tests: two novel object tests (non-social contexts) and two novel animated stimuli tests (social contexts). Our results showed consistency in shyness measures across multiple tests, indicating the existence of personality in farmed American mink. It was found that consistency in shyness measures differs across non-social and social contexts, as well as across the various stages in the approach towards novel objects, revealing that different aspects of shyness exist in the farmed American mink. To our knowledge this is the first study to reveal aspects of the shyness-boldness continuum in the American mink. Since the mink were raised in identical housing conditions, inherited factors may have been important in shaping the consistent inter-individual variation. Body weight and sex had no effect on the personality of the mink. Altogether, our results suggest that the shyness-boldness continuum cannot be explained by a simple underlying dispositional factor, but instead encompasses a broader term of hesitating behaviour that might comprise several different personality traits."
https://openalex.org/W2211911907,"At present, approximately 187 genera and over 1300 species of Microsporidia have been described, among which almost half infect aquatic species and approximately 50 genera potentially infect aquatic arthropods. Lake Baikal is the deepest and one of the oldest lakes in the world, and it has a rich endemic fauna with a predominance of arthropods. Among the arthropods living in this lake, amphipods (Crustacea) are the most dominant group and are represented by more than 350 endemic species. Baikalian amphipods inhabit almost all depths and all types of substrates. The age and geographical isolation of this group creates excellent opportunities for studying the diversity, evolution and genetics of host-parasite relationships. However, despite more than 150 years of study, data investigating the microsporidia of Lake Baikal remain incomplete. In this study, we used molecular genetic analyses to detect microsporidia in the hemolymph of several endemic species of amphipods from Lake Baikal. We provide the first evidence that microsporidian species belonging to three genera (Microsporidium, Dictyocoela and Nosema) are present in the hemolymph of Baikalian endemic amphipods. In the hemolymph of Eulimnogammarus verrucosus, we detected SSU rDNA of microsporidia belonging to the genus Nozema. In the hemolymph of Pallasea cancellous, we found the DNA of Microsporidium sp. similar to that in other Baikalian endemic amphipods; Dictyocoela sp. was found in the hemolymph of Eulimnogammarus marituji and Acanthogammarus lappaceus longispinus."

Each step in the treatment-seeking pathway must be considered in order to establish where opportunities for successful engagement and treatment occur. We describe local classifications of childhood febrile illnesses, present an overview of treatment-seeking, beginning with recognition of illness, and suggest how interventions could be used to target the barriers experienced.Qualitative data were collected between September 2010 and February 2011. A total of 12 Focus Group Discussions and 22 Critical Incident Interviews were conducted with primary caregivers who had reported a recent febrile episode for one of their children.The phrase 'kutentha thupi', or 'hot body' was used to describe fever, the most frequently mentioned causes of which were malungo (translated as 'malaria'), mauka, nyankhwa and (m)tsempho. Differentiating the cause was challenging because these illnesses were described as having many similar non-specific symptoms, despite considerable differences in the perceived mechanisms of illness. Malungo was widely understood to be caused by mosquitoes. Commonly described symptoms included: fever, weakness, vomiting, diarrhoea and coughing. These symptoms matched well with the biomedical definition of malaria, although they also overlapped with symptoms of other illnesses in both the biomedical model and local illness classifications. In addition, malungo was used interchangeably to describe malaria and fever in general. Caregivers engaged in a three-phased approach to treatment seeking. Phase 1-Assessment; Phase 2-Seeking care outside the home; Phase 3-Evaluation of treatment response. Within this paper, the three-phased approach is explored to identify potential interventions to target barriers to appropriate treatment. Community engagement and health promotion, the provision of antimalarials at community level and better training health workers in the causes and treatment of non-malarial febrile illnesses may improve access to appropriate treatment and outcomes."

The biosynthesis of the core ring structure of Chls and BChls starts with the ATP-dependent magnesium insertion into the fully conjugated protoporphyrin IX molecule. The following two reaction steps are then responsible for the formation of the fifth, isocyclic ring E. The propionate side chain at ring C is methylated, and the resulting magnesium protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester is subsequently converted into 8-vinyl protochlorophyllide in a sophisticated oxidation/cyclization reaction. Then the reduction of the peripheral vinyl group at C8 results in the formation of protochlorophyllide a (Pchlide; compound 11; see Fig. 5) (for a review of Chl biosynthesis, see Ref. 2Bröcker M.J. Jahn D. Moser J. Ferreira G.C. Handbook of Porphyrin Science. World Scientific, Singapore2012: 1-43Google Scholar).

Plasticity of the late steps of BChl/Chl biosynthesis was also proposed with respect to the 8-vinyl reduction step and for the formation of the 7-formyl group of Chl b on the basis of in vitro experiments using chemically modified substrate variants. An 8-vinyl derivative (instead of the 8-ethyl substrate) and the 7-formyl analog (instead of the 7-methyl substrate) were efficiently converted by DPOR (20Bröcker M.J. Wätzlich D. Uliczka F. Virus S.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6176-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The main photosynthetic pigments of C. tepidum are BChl c, Chl a, and BChl a. The term “BChl c” names a group of pigments differing from other BChls and Chls: BChl c molecules contain a chiral hydroxylated center at C31, lack a 132-methylcarboxylate group, and possess a characteristic C20 methyl group together with a varying number of additional methyl groups at C82 and C121 (for a review, see Ref. 24Liu Z. Bryant D.A. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. Handbook of Porphyrin Science: Chlorophylls and Related Systems. World Scientific, Singapore2012: 107-140Google Scholar). Despite the established designation as a BChl, all BChl c pigments possess a chlorin instead of a bacteriochlorin ring system (Fig. 1B). BChl c molecules are the major light-harvesting pigments that are present in large antenna structures called chlorosomes where they self-assemble into tubular nanostructures that are stabilized by interpigment magnesium ligation and π-π and H-bonding interactions (25Ganapathy S.

Chl a acts as the primary electron acceptor in the photochemical reaction centers of C. tepidum. BChl a also plays a fundamental role in the reaction center, and it is also found in antenna proteins of the chlorosome envelope (for a review, see Ref. 27Orf G.S. Blankenship R.E.

Besides this, the bchF gene from C. tepidum has been shown to complement a bchF-deficient R. capsulatus mutant (32Xiong J. Fischer W.M. Inoue K. Nakahara M. Bauer C.E. Molecular evidence for the early evolution of photosynthesis.Science. 2000; 289: 1724-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). No further biochemical characterization of any BchF or BchC enzyme is available from the literature to date. In the present investigation, we made use of recombinant DPOR, BchF, and BchC proteins to analyze the BChl a biosynthesis pathway of C. tepidum. A series of artificial BchC substrates allowed for the characterization of the substrate specificity of BchC. These results, in combination with a DPOR-BchF-BchC pathway reconstitution assay, would allow for a novel branched biosynthetic route via 3-hydroxyethyl chlorophyllide a (31-OH-Chlide; compound 12) as a BchC substrate. In addition, the cofactor specificity and metal requirement of BchC were characterized. Genes bchF and bchC from C. tepidum strain TLS were PCR-amplified using primers GCAGGATCCGATGCCTCGTTATACACC and GCAGTCGACTCAGACGGCTCCGCTG (bchF/pACYCDuet-1), GCAGGATCCATGGAAGCGAAGAAATCC and GCAGTCGACTCAGTTGGCCGTGTTGC (bchC/pGEX6P-1), or GACCATATGGAAGCGAAGAAATCCAAAGCC and GACCTCGAGGTTGGCCGTGTTGCAG (bchC/pACYCDuet-1; integrated restriction sites are shown in italics). PCR products were ligated into the BamHI and SalI sites of pACYCDuet-1 (bchF, first multiple cloning site) (Merck Millipore Novagen®) and pGEX6P-1 (bchC) (GE Healthcare) to yield plasmids pACYC-F (coding for a His6-BchF fusion protein) and pGEX-C (coding for a GST-BchC fusion protein). Subsequently, the bchC gene was cloned into the second multiple cloning site of pACYC-F via restriction sites NdeI and XhoI to yield plasmid pACYC-FC. The three plasmids were individually transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Overnight cultures were used to inoculate 500 ml of LB medium containing the respective antibiotics. Protein production in the strains containing plasmids pACYC-F and pACYC-FC (or pGEX-C) was induced at an A578 of ∼0.5 by the addition of 300 μm (50 μm) isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 3 h (14 h) of cultivation at 37 °C (17 °C) at 200 rpm (180 rpm), the cells were harvested, resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer 1 composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (20 ml/liter of culture buffer 2 composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), and stored at −20 °C. Production of C. tepidum DPOR subunits N, B, and L was mainly performed as described earlier (plasmid pGEX-bchNBL (5Bröcker M.J. Virus S. Ganskow S. Heathcote P. Heinz D.W. Schubert W.D. Jahn D. Moser J. ATP-driven reduction by dark-operative protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase from Chlorobium tepidum mechanistically resembles nitrogenase catalysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10559-10567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)) using 500 ml of LB medium containing 1 mm l-cysteine and 1 mm Fe(III) citrate to improve iron-sulfur cluster formation. All remaining steps were performed under anoxic conditions at an oxygen partial pressure below 1 ppm (oxygen detector, Coy Laboratories, Grass Lake, MI). Cells were harvested and resuspended in 10 ml of anoxic buffer 3 (100 mm HEPES-NaOH, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5). The cell-free extract containing all three DPOR subunits was obtained by a single French press passage (16,000 p.s.i.) and subsequent ultracentrifugation in sealed anoxic tubes (4 °C, 65 min, 130,000 × g). The supernatant was stored as 500-μl aliquots in anoxic bottles at −20 °C for up to 3 months. The resuspended pellet from 500 ml of an E. coli culture containing pACYC-FC was passed through a French press (16,000 p.s.i.), and the crude cellular extract was stored on ice. The resuspended pellet from 500 ml of E. coli culture overproducing His6-BchF (pACYC-F) was disrupted by a single French press passage (16,000 p.s.i.). For the BchF activity assays, this crude cellular extract was stored on ice for up to 6 h. His6-BchF was solubilized from the host membrane fraction. For this purpose, the crude cellular extract was subjected to low speed centrifugation (4 °C, 60 min, 4,000 × g). The resulting supernatant was then subjected to ultracentrifugation (4 °C, 60 min, 146,000 × g). The obtained supernatant was discarded, and the membrane pellet was washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold buffer 4 (50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0). Subsequently, membrane proteins were solubilized from the membrane fraction by stirring at 4 °C for 2 h in 7 ml of solubilization buffer (buffer 4 containing 0.6% (v/v) TritonTM X-100). After another ultracentrifugation step (4 °C, 60 min, 146,000 × g), the supernatant containing the solubilized membrane proteins was stored on ice for subsequent activity measurements. Integrity of the His6-BchF protein fraction was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. The resuspended pellet from 1 liter of E. coli cell culture overproducing GST-BchC (from plasmid pGEX-C) was thawed on ice for 12 h, 2 μl Benzonase® (Merck Millipore) was added, and the cells were disrupted by a single passage through a French press at 16,000 p.s.i. Cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation (4 °C, 65 min, 130,000 × g), and the supernatant was applied to 1 ml of Protino® glutathione-agarose 4B (Macherey-Nagel) equilibrated with buffer 2 at room temperature. The column flow-through was applied to the resin twice to increase the yield of the affinity chromatography. After washing with 10 ml of buffer 2, the loaded column was incubated with 60 units of PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) for 90 min at 22 °C under slight agitation. The liberated BchC protein was eluted with 3 ml of buffer 2 and stored at 4 °C. The concentration of purified protein fractions was determined using the Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions with bovine serum albumin dissolved in buffer 2 as a standard. Automated Edman degradation was used to confirm the identity of the solubilized BchF and the purified BchC protein. Purified BchC samples were incubated in the presence of EDTA or EGTA at concentrations of 10 or 100 mm (75 min at 48 °C). After a centrifugation step (10 min, 12,100 × g, room temperature), protein solutions were buffer-exchanged to buffer 2 using an “illustra” NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein samples were concentrated using an Amicon® Ultra-0.5 centrifugal filter device (10,000 nominal molecular weight limit; Merck Millipore) and subjected to BchC activity assays. Compounds 1–6 (Fig. 1, compare B and C) were dissolved in DMSO. Their respective syntheses and/or isolations are cited in Fig. 1C. Qualitative in vitro activity assays containing 3.2–8.4 μm BchC were performed in the presence of 1 mm NAD+ (or alternatively 1 mm NADH) and 750 nm–23 μm substrates 1–6 in a total volume of 250 μl of buffer 1. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 34 °C in the dark and subsequently stopped by addition of 500 μl of acetone. Insoluble assay components were sedimented (two times, 17,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was analyzed by UV-visible light absorption spectroscopy as described elsewhere (9Kiesel S.

The specific activity of BchC in the presence of compounds 1–3, 5, and 6 was determined in the linear range of the activity assay (100 nm–1 μm purified enzyme and 8 μm substrate) in the presence of 1 mm NAD+ or NADH in a volume of 550 μl. Compounds 1 and 5 were epimeric 31 R/S mixtures; hence an effective substrate concentration of ∼4 μm was implied (60Struck A. Cmiel E. Katheder I. Schäfer W. Scheer H.

It is worth noting that esterified pigments (at C173) show an extinction coefficient of the QY band identical to that observed for the non-esterified derivatives. Chelator-treated BchC samples (3.2 μm) were assayed in the presence of compound 1 (10 μm) or 5 (2.6 μm) for 30 min.

https://openalex.org/W1842833460,"DMC1 and RAD51 are conserved recombinases that catalyze homologous recombination. DMC1 and RAD51 share similar properties in DNA binding, DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, and catalysis of homologous DNA strand exchange. A large body of evidence indicates that attenuation of ATP hydrolysis leads to stabilization of the RAD51-ssDNA presynaptic filament and enhancement of DNA strand exchange. However, the functional relationship of ATPase activity, presynaptic filament stability, and DMC1-mediated homologous DNA strand exchange has remained largely unexplored. To address this important question, we have constructed several mutant variants of human DMC1 and characterized them biochemically to gain mechanistic insights. Two mutations, K132R and D223N, that change key residues in the Walker A and B nucleotide-binding motifs ablate ATP binding and render DMC1 inactive. On the other hand, the nucleotide-binding cap D317K mutant binds ATP normally but shows significantly attenuated ATPase activity and, accordingly, forms a highly stable presynaptic filament. Surprisingly, unlike RAD51, presynaptic filament stabilization achieved via ATP hydrolysis attenuation does not lead to any enhancement of DMC1-catalyzed homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange. This conclusion is further supported by examining wild-type DMC1 with non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues. Thus, our results reveal an important mechanistic difference between RAD51 and DMC1.

To initiate HR, a recombinase enzyme polymerizes on ssDNA derived from the nucleolytic processing of a primary lesion, e.g. a DNA double-strand break, to form a right-handed, helical protein filament known as the presynaptic filament. The presynaptic filament searches for homology in duplex DNA, and once homology is located, recombinase-mediated DNA pairing forms a D-loop structure to initiate genetic exchange (1Krogh B.O.

RAD51 and DMC1 are the two conserved recombinases that catalyze HR reactions in eukaryotes. Although RAD51 functions in both mitotic and meiotic cells, DMC1 is meiosis-specific (8Neale M.J. Keeney S.

It has been well documented that the attenuation of ATP hydrolysis, either through the introduction of specific mutations into RAD51 or through the use of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, enhances the stability of the presynaptic filament and recombinase activity (28Chi P.

Consistent with this relationship, the RAD51-interacting SWI5-SFR1 complex facilitates RAD51-mediated recombination by maintaining the ATP-bound form of the RAD51 presynaptic filament (31Tsai S.P. Su G.C. Lin S.W. Chung C.I. Xue X. Dunlop M.H. Akamatsu Y. Jasin M. Sung P. Chi P.

Thus, the active conformation of the RAD51 presynaptic filament requires ATP being bound, but ATP hydrolysis is dispensable and in fact diminishes recombinase activity because of protein turnover. DMC1 also requires ATP for the assembly of a functional presynaptic filament and to perform homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange. However, studies that have been conducted thus far provide no evidence for an up-regulation of DMC1 recombinase activity upon attenuation of ATP hydrolysis by the presynaptic filament (22Sehorn M.G. Sigurdsson S. Bussen W. Unger V.M. Sung P.

These observations suggest important mechanistic differences between RAD51 and DMC1 with regards to presynaptic filament assembly and recombinase activity. In this study, we have strived to define how ATP hydrolysis affects the stability of the DMC1 presynaptic filament and ensuing homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange efficiency. For this purpose, we have generated the D317K mutant that exhibits attenuated ATPase activity but remains proficient in ATP binding. Our biochemical analyses reveal that although the DMC1 D317K mutant protein readily forms a presynaptic filament with enhanced stability, it is compromised for the ability to mediate homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange. Similar results have been obtained using the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues AMP-PNP and AMP-PCP with wild-type DMC1. Our findings thus provide evidence that, unlike RAD51, ATP hydrolysis by the DMC1 presynaptic filament correlates with filament stability but not with DNA pairing and strand exchange activity. Both replicative form I dsDNA and viral (+)-strand Φx174 ssDNA were purchased from New England Biolabs. The linear Φx174 dsDNA was prepared by treatment of the replicative form I dsDNA with the restriction enzyme PstI (New England Biolabs) and purification using the PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Oligonucleotides were purified as described previously (31Tsai S.P. Su G.C. Lin S.W. Chung C.I. Xue X. Dunlop M.H. Akamatsu Y. Jasin M. Sung P. Chi P. Rad51 presynaptic filament stabilization function of the mouse Swi5-Sfr1 heterodimeric complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 6558-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The 80-mer Oligo 1 (5′-TTATGTTCATTTTTTATATCCTTTACTTTATTTTCTCTGTTTATTCATTTACTTATTTTGTATTATCCTTATCTTATTTA) was used to assemble the presynaptic filament for DNA strand exchange reactions. To prepare the homologous 40-mer duplex dsDNA, Oligo 2 (5′-TAATACAAAATAAGTAAATGAATAAACAGAGAAAATAAAG) was 5′ end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer). Following removal of the unincorporated nucleotide with a Spin 6 column (Bio-Rad), the radiolabeled oligonucleotide was annealed to its exact complement (Oligo 3) by heating the mixture of the two oligonucleotides at 85 °C for 10 min and its slow cooling to 25 °C over the course of ∼1.5 h. After purification from a 10% polyacrylamide gel, the duplex was concentrated. For the D-loop reaction, the 90-mer Oligo 4 (5′-AAATCAATCTAAAGTATATATGAGTAAACTTGGTCTGACAGTTACCAATGCTTAATCAGTGAGGCACCTATCTCAGCGATCTGTCTATTT) was 5′ end-labeled as above. To prepare 5′ end-labeled ssDNA for the Exonuclease I protection assay, Oligo 1 was 5′ end-labeled as above. For the RecJ protection assay, Oligo 1 was treated with terminal transferase (Roche Applied Science) and [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer) to label its 3′ end. The unincorporated nucleotides were removed as above. The DMC1 expression plasmid was obtained by inserting the human DMC1 cDNA into the BamHI site of the pRSFDuet vector (Novagen), which added a His6 tag to the amino terminus of the protein. Construction of the DMC1 mutant variants D317K, K132R, and D223N was by site-directed mutagenesis. All the protein expression plasmids were sequenced to ensure that no undesired mutation had occurred. RecA-deficient Escherichia coli cells (strain BLR) harboring the His6-tagged DMC1 expression plasmid were cultured in Luria broth at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.6–0.8, at which point 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added and cultures were incubated for an additional 2.5 h at 37 °C. All the protein purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. To purify the His6-tagged DMC1, 50–60 g of cell paste was suspended in 150 ml of breakage buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 300 mm KCl, 0.01% IGEPAL, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, and the protease inhibitors aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, Bestatin, and pepstatin A, each at 3 μg/ml). The cell suspension was then subjected to sonication. The clarified lysate was prepared by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h) and incubated with 5 ml of TALON resin (Clontech) for 4 h. The slurry was transferred to a column and washed with 50 ml of breakage buffer containing 5 mm imidazole. DMC1 was eluted with 25 ml of elution buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 0.01% IGEPAL, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 200 mm imidazole) containing protease inhibitors. The eluate was fractionated in a 1-ml Source Q column by applying a 60-ml gradient of 75–450 mm KCl in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.01% IGEPAL, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm EDTA). The pooled DMC1-containing fraction was diluted and further fractionated in a 1-ml macrohydroxyapatite column using a 45-ml gradient of 70–630 mm KH2PO4 in buffer A containing 75 mm KCl. The pooled DMC1-containing fraction was diluted and further fractionated in a 1-ml Mono Q column with a 30-ml 75–400 mm KCl gradient in buffer A. Then, the DMC1-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated in a Centricon-30 concentrator (Millipore). The concentrated preparation was divided into small aliquots and stored at −80 °C. The His6-tagged DMC1 D317K, His6-tagged DMC1 K132R, and His6-tagged DMC1 D223N were expressed and purified using the same procedure. A previously described procedure was followed (35Tombline G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14426-14433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, His6-tagged DMC1 or mutant protein was incubated with 2.4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in buffer B (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 100 ng/μl BSA, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) for 10 min at 37 °C, and cross-linking was carried out using a Stratalinker® UV Crosslinker 1800 (Stratagene) for 10 min on ice. Samples were resolved by 13.5% SDS-PAGE at 4 °C, and the gel was dried onto DE81 Paper (Whatman) and analyzed in the Personal Molecular Imager (PMI) (Bio-Rad). His6-tagged DMC1 or DMC1 D317K (2.5 μm) was incubated in buffer C (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 100 ng/μl BSA, 15 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 0.6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) without or with Φx174 viral (+) strand ssDNA (37.5 μm nucleotides) or linearized dsDNA (37.5 μm base pairs) at 37 °C for the indicated times. Aliquots (2 μl) were taken at the indicated times and mixed with an equal volume of 500 mm EDTA. ATP hydrolysis was determined by thin-layer chromatography on a polyethyleneimine sheet (Sigma-Aldrich) using 0.15 m LiCl and 0.5 m formic acid as the developing buffer. The chromatography sheet was air-dried and subjected to phosphorimaging analysis. The Φx174 viral (+) strand ssDNA (15 μm nucleotides) or linearized dsDNA (15 μm base pairs) was incubated with the indicated amount of His6-tagged DMC1 or DMC1 D317K in 10 μl of buffer B (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 100 ng/μl BSA, 100 mm KCl and 5 mm MgCl2) with 1 mm ATP at 37 °C for 5 min. Reaction mixtures were fractionated in a 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris, 20 mm acetate, pH 7.5, and 2 mm EDTA) at 4 °C, and the DNA species were stained with ethidium bromide. The gels were analyzed in a gel documentation station (Bio-Rad). For Fig. 3C, the 5′ end 32P-labeled 80-mer Oligo 1 ssDNA (3 μm nucleotides) were incubated with the indicated amount of His6-tagged DMC1 or DMC1 D317K in 10 μl of buffer B with 1 mm nucleotide (ATP, AMP-PNP, or AMP-PCP) at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction mixtures were fractionated in 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer at 4 °C. The gels were dried onto DE81 paper and subjected to phosphorimaging analysis. For this assay, His6-tagged DMC1 or DMC1 D317K was incubated with either 5′ or 3′ 32P-labeled Oligo 1 ssDNA (3 μm nucleotides) in 9 μl of buffer B (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 100 ng/μl BSA, 100 mm KCl and 5 mm MgCl2) with 1 mm nucleotide (ATP, AMP-PNP, or AMP-PCP, as indicated) at 37 °C for 5 min. Then, E. coli Exonuclease I, which has a 3′ to 5′ polarity and was used to test the 5′ end-labeled DNA (0.8 unit; New England Biolabs), or E. coli RecJ, which has a 5′ to 3′ polarity and was used to test the 3′ end-labeled DNA, was added to the reaction mixture (10 μl final volume). After 5 min of digestion at 37 °C, reaction mixtures were mixed with 2.5 μl of termination buffer (240 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and proteinase K at 0.32 mg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Then, the reaction mixtures were resolved in a 10% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm borate, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and after drying the gel, the DNA species were quantified by phosphorimaging analysis. The 80-mer Oligo 1 (4.8 μm nucleotides) was incubated with the indicated amount of His6-tagged DMC1 or DMC1 D317K in buffer B (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 100 ng/μl BSA, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) with 1 mm nucleotide (ATP, ADP, ATPγS, AMP-PNP, or AMP-PCP, as indicated) for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding homologous 32P-labeled 40-mer duplex (2.4 μm base pairs) to a final volume of 12.5 μl. After a 30-min incubation, a 5-μl aliquot was removed, mixed with an equal volume of 0.1% SDS containing proteinase K (1 mg/ml), and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The samples were fractionated in 10% polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer. Gels were dried onto DE81 paper and subjected to phosphorimaging analysis. The 32P-labeled 90-mer Oligo 4 (2.4 μm nucleotides) was incubated with the indicated amount of His6-tagged DMC1 or DMC1 D317K in 10.5 μl of buffer B (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 100 ng/μl BSA, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) with 1 mm nucleotide (ATP, ADP, ATPγS, AMP-PNP, or AMP-PCP, as indicated) for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding pBluescript replicative form I DNA (190 μm base pairs) to a 12.5-μl final volume. After 4 min of incubation, a 5-μl aliquot was removed, mixed with an equal volume of 0.1% SDS containing proteinase K (1 mg/ml), and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The samples were analyzed on 0.9% agarose gels in TBE buffer at 4 °C. Gels were dried onto DE81 paper and subjected to phosphorimaging analysis. Although ATP is required for DMC1-mediated homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange (34Sharma D. Say A.F. Ledford L.L. Hughes A.J. Sehorn H.A. Dwyer D.S. Sehorn M.G.

To address this issue, we aimed to identify DMC1 mutant variants that bind ATP but exhibit attenuated ATP hydrolysis. To this end, we focused on residues in DMC1 (namely, Asp-317, Lys-132, and Asp-223) predicted to affect ATP hydrolysis based on the following rationale. (a) We changed Asp-317 in the ATP cap in DMC1 to Lys (Fig. 1A, panel I) because mutating the analogous residue in RAD51 has no effect on ATP binding ability but greatly attenuates ATP hydrolysis (30Amunugama R. He Y. Willcox S. Forties R.A. Shim K.S. Bundschuh R. Luo Y. Griffith J. Fishel R. RAD51 protein ATP cap regulates nucleoprotein filament stability.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 8724-8736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). (b) Lys-132 in DMC1, part of the Walker A motif involved in ATP binding, was changed to Arg because the equivalent mutation in other ATPases (28Chi P. Van Komen S. Sehorn M.G. Sigurdsson S. Sung P. Roles of ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis in human Rad51 recombinase function.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 381-39110.1016/j.dnarep.2005.11.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) often affects ATP hydrolysis without a significant effect on ATP binding (Fig. 1A, panel II). (c) Asp-223, part of the Walker B motif in DMC1, was mutated to Asn (Fig. 1A, panel III) because the equivalent mutation in several AAA+ ATPases ablates ATP hydrolysis without a strong effect on ATP binding (36Rai V. Gaur M. Shukla S. Shukla S. Ambudkar S.V. Komath S.S. Prasad R.

DMC1 and the three DMC1 mutants (i.e. D317K, K132R, and D223N) were expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity. The chromatographs are shown (Fig. 1B), and the procedural details were described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mutants could be expressed to the same level as the wild-type protein and purified with the same procedure and a similar yield. We obtained wild-type and mutant DMC1 proteins with purities ≥98% (Fig. 1C). We first examined the ATP binding ability of the DMC1 mutant variants. Briefly, purified DMC1 and mutants were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and then irradiated in a Stratalinker® UV Crosslinker 1800. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed in a Personal Molecular Imager (PMI) (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, D317K has a more enhanced ATP binding capacity than the wild-type protein (Fig. 2B). However, the K132R and D223N variants were significantly impaired for ATP binding (Fig. 2C). We next used thin-layer chromatography to examine the mutant DMC1 proteins for their ATPase activity in the presence of either ssDNA or dsDNA. The results showed that D317K is significantly reduced for ATP hydrolysis capability with both DNA species (Fig. 2, D and E), whereas the K132R and D223N mutants are quite defective in this regard (Fig. 2F). The results thus revealed that DMC1 D317K mutant is proficient in ATP binding but specifically impaired for ATP hydrolysis. It has been documented that DMC1-mediated ATP hydrolysis is stimulated by DNA (20Li Z. Golub E.I. Gupta R. Radding C.M.

The two proteins were incubated with ΦX174 ssDNA (Fig. 3A) and also linear dsDNA (Fig. 3B) in the presence of ATP, and DNA binding was analyzed in an agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining of the DNA species. Especially with ssDNA, the D317K variant generated a more pronounced shift of the DNA than did wild-type DMC1, suggesting that it has the same or perhaps even an enhanced DNA binding capability (Fig. 3A, comparing lanes 2, 3, and 4 with lanes 6, 7, and 8, respectively). To facilitate quantification of DNA binding, a 32P-labeled 80-mer ssDNA was also employed as the substrate. This allowed us to verify that the D317K variant indeed possesses a higher level of DNA binding activity relative to the wild-type protein (Fig. 3C). Taken together, the results above show that the DMC1 D317K mutation affects ATP hydrolysis but leads to an enhanced capability to bind ATP and DNA. The results shown above revealed that attenuating ATP hydrolysis by the D317K m"

Processing of the shRNA requires the RNaseIII-like Dicer enzyme to remove the loop and to release the biologically active small interfering RNA (siRNA). Dicer is also involved in microRNA (miRNA) processing to liberate the mature miRNA duplex, but recent studies indicate that miR-451 is not processed by Dicer. Instead, this miRNA is processed by the Argonaute 2 (Ago2) protein, which also executes the subsequent cleavage of a complementary mRNA target. Interestingly, shRNAs that structurally resemble miR-451 can also be processed by Ago2 instead of Dicer. The key determinant of these ""AgoshRNA"" molecules is a relatively short basepaired stem, which avoids Dicer recognition and consequently allows alternative processing by Ago2. AgoshRNA processing yields a single active RNA strand, whereas standard shRNAs produce a duplex with guide and passenger strands and the latter may cause adverse off-target effects. In this study, we converted previously tested active anti-HIV-1 shRNA molecules into AgoshRNA. We tested several designs that could potentially improve AgoshRNA activity, including extension of the complementarity between the guide strand and the mRNA target and reduction of the thermodynamic stability of the hairpins. We demonstrate that active AgoshRNAs can be generated. However, the RNAi activity is reduced compared to the matching shRNAs. Despite reduced RNAi activity, comparison of an active AgoshRNA and the matching shRNA in a sensitive cell toxicity assay revealed that the AgoshRNA is much less toxic."

The 120-amino acid (aa) stretch of the Rad9 C terminus (C-tail) is unstructured and projects from the core ring structure (CRS). Recent studies showed that 9-1-1 and CRS bind DNA independently of Rad17-RFC. The DNA-binding affinity of mutant 9ΔC-1-1, which lacked the Rad9 C-tail, was much higher than that of wild-type 9-1-1, suggesting that 9-1-1 has intrinsic DNA binding activity that manifests in the absence of the C-tail. C-tail added in trans interacted with CRS and prevented it from binding to DNA. We narrowed down the amino acid sequence in the C-tail necessary for CRS binding to a 15-aa stretch harboring two conserved consecutive phenylalanine residues. We prepared 9-1-1 mutants containing the variant C-tail deficient for CRS binding, and we demonstrated that the mutant form restored DNA binding as efficiently as 9ΔC-1-1. Furthermore, we mapped the sequence necessary for TopBP1 binding within the same 15-aa stretch, demonstrating that TopBP1 and CRS share the same binding region in the C-tail. Indeed, we observed their competitive binding to the C-tail with purified proteins. The importance of interaction between 9-1-1 and TopBP1 for DNA damage signaling suggests that the competitive interactions of TopBP1 and CRS with the C-tail will be crucial for the activation mechanism.

R. palustris was grown in flow cell chambers with identical medium conditions either in the presence or absence of light and oxygen. In the absence of oxygen and the presence of light, R. palustris grew and formed biofilms photoheterotrophically, and in the presence of oxygen and the absence of light, R. palustris grew and formed biofilms heterotrophically. We used confocal laser scanning microscopy and image analysis software to quantitatively analyze and compare R. palustris biofilm formation over time in these two metabolic modes. We describe quantifiable differences in structure between the biofilms formed by the bacterium grown heterotrophically and those grown photoheterotrophically. We developed a computational model to explore ways in which biotic and abiotic parameters could drive the observed biofilm architectures, as well as a random-forest machine-learning algorithm based on structural differences that was able to identify growth conditions from the confocal imaging of the biofilms with 87% accuracy. Insight into the structure of phototrophic biofilms and conditions that influence biofilm formation is relevant for understanding the generation of biofilm structures with different properties, and for optimizing applications with phototrophic bacteria growing in the biofilm state."

We examined the distribution of medullary nuclei that are activated by the LCR and used immunofluorescent detection of Fos protein as a cellular marker for neuronal activation to establish that the medullary catecholaminergic and serotoninergic neurons participate in the modulation of the LCR. The LCR was elicited by the infusion of KCl-HCl solution into the laryngeal lumen of adult rats in the experimental group, whereas the control group received the same surgery but no infusion. In comparison, the number of regions of Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) that were activated by the LCR significantly increased in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), the vestibular nuclear complex (VNC), the loose formation of the nucleus ambiguus (AmbL), the rostral ventral respiratory group (RVRG), the ventrolateral reticular complex (VLR), the pre-Bötzinger complex (PrBöt), the Bötzinger complex (Böt), the spinal trigeminal nucleus (SP5), and the raphe obscurus nucleus (ROb) bilaterally from the medulla oblongata. Furthermore, 12.71% of neurons with FLI in the dorsolateral part of the nucleus of the solitary tract (SolDL) showed tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity (TH-ir, catecholaminergic), and 70.87% of neurons with FLI in the ROb were serotoninergic. Our data demonstrated the distribution of medullary nuclei that were activated by the LCR, and further demonstrated that catecholaminergic neurons of the SolDL and serotoninergic neurons of the ROb were activated by the LCR, indicating the potential central pathway of the LCR."

In the present study, a molecular test for detection of high-risk HPV DNA, called E7-HPV, was standardized and assessed in samples from women with pre-cancerous lesions. The development of the E7-HPV test for detection and genotyping of six high-risk HPV (types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45 and 52), consisted of evaluating primer quality and adjusting the multiplex PCR conditions. Primer design was based on the E7 region of each HPV, and the fluorochrome 6-FAM was added to PCR primers. Viral detection was performed by capillary electrophoresis in automated sequencer in samples obtained from 60 women (55 with ASC-H/HSIL cytology) from August to September 2013. A non-inferiority analysis was conducted with the cobas HPV test as a reference and following international guidelines for the development of new tests. The two tests had a high concordance rate in HPV16 detection (kappa=0.972), with only one discordant case (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, negative with cobas and positive for HPV16 by E7-HPV) and complete agreement in HPV18 detection. When comparing detection of all high-risk HPV, three cases were positive with cobas but negative with E7-HPV, and another three cases were negative with cobas but positive with E7-HPV (HPV16, 31 and 52). When we evaluate the cases initially suspected by cytology, the two tests had the same sensitivity in detection CIN2 or worse. In conclusion, the E7-HPV test has satisfactory initial results, and its development can be continued."
https://openalex.org/W1594494220,"The IS6110 insertion sequence, a member of the IS3 family of insertion sequences, was found to be specific to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Although IS6110 has been extensively characterized as a transposable genetic marker, the evolutionary history of its own transposase-encoding sequence has not, to the best of our knowledge, been investigated.Here we explored the evolution of the IS6110 sequence by analysing the genetic variability and the selective forces acting on its transposase-encoding open reading frames (ORFs) A and B (orfA and orfB). For this purpose, we used a strain collection consisting of smooth tubercle bacilli (STB), an early branching lineage of the MTBC, and present-day M. tuberculosis strains representing the full breadth of genetic diversity in Tunisia. In each ORF, we found a major haplotype that dominated over a flat distribution of rare descendent haplotypes, consisting mainly of single- and double-nucleotide variant singletons. The predominant haplotypes consisted of both ancestral and present-day strains, suggesting that IS6110 acquisition predated the emergence of the MTBC. There was no evidence of recombination and both ORFs were subjected to strict purifying selection, as demonstrated by their dN/dS ratios (0.29 and 0.51, respectively), as well as their significantly negative Tajima's D statistics. Strikingly, the purifying selection acting on orfA proved much more stringent, suggesting its critical role in regulating the transpositional process. Maximum likelihood analyses further excluded any possibility of positive selection acting on single amino acid residues.Taken together our data fit with an evolutionary scenario according to which the observed variability pattern of the IS6110 transposase-encoding ORFs is generated mainly through random point mutations that accrued on a functionally optimal IS6110 copy, whose acquisition predated the emergence of the MTBC complex. Background selection acting against deleterious mutations led to an excess of low-frequency variants."

This study aims to assess whether NAFLD is associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels and to understand early changes of eGFR in NAFLD. A cross-sectional study was performed among apparently healthy persons who underwent general health screening including laboratory assessments and hepatic ultrasonography from January 2013 to December 2013 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, College of Medicine, China. This study included 1,193 subjects with a mean age of 48 years. Prevalence of NAFLD was 31.3%. Mean eGFR was significantly lower in NAFLD than in controls (107 ± 19 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs. 113 ± 23 mL/min/1.73 m2, P<0.001). Correlation analysis between eGFR and NAFLD related risk factors revealed an inverse correlation between eGFR levels and some NAFLD risk factors (all P<0.01). All subjects were classified into five phases according to age. Average eGFR levels of NAFLD were lower than controls in three phases for subjects with ≤ 50 years of age (all P<0.05), while there were no significant differences on average eGFR levels between NAFLD and controls in two phases for subjects with >50 years of age (Both P>0.05). The eGFR level is significantly associated with NAFLD and its risk factors in an apparently healthy population. Effects of NAFLD on eGFR could be dependent on age."
