https://openalex.org/W2136388422,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. We previously mapped a locus for a rare familial form of PD to chromosome 1p36 (PARK6). Here we show that mutations in PINK1 (PTEN-induced kinase 1) are associated with PARK6. We have identified two homozygous mutations affecting the PINK1 kinase domain in three consanguineous PARK6 families: a truncating nonsense mutation and a missense mutation at a highly conserved amino acid. Cell culture studies suggest that PINK1 is mitochondrially located and may exert a protective effect on the cell that is abrogated by the mutations, resulting in increased susceptibility to cellular stress. These data provide a direct molecular link between mitochondria and the pathogenesis of PD."

According to recent reinforcement learning models, two distinct components are involved: a “critic,” which learns to predict future reward, and an “actor,” which maintains information about the rewarding outcomes of actions to enable better ones to be chosen more frequently. We scanned human participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they engaged in instrumental conditioning. Our results suggest partly dissociable contributions of the ventral and dorsal striatum, with the former corresponding to the critic and the latter corresponding to the actor."
https://openalex.org/W2163757074,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of β-amyloid (Aβ)–induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we demonstrate that Aβ-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD) is a direct molecular link from Aβ to mitochondrial toxicity. Aβ interacts with ABAD in the mitochondria of AD patients and transgenic mice. The crystal structure of Aβ-bound ABAD shows substantial deformation of the active site that prevents nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) binding. An ABAD peptide specifically inhibits ABAD-Aβ interaction and suppresses Aβ-induced apoptosis and free-radical generation in neurons. Transgenic mice overexpressing ABAD in an Aβ-rich environment manifest exaggerated neuronal oxidative stress and impaired memory. These data suggest that the ABAD-Aβ interaction may be a therapeutic target in AD."
https://openalex.org/W1964138747,"Time-resolved x-ray imaging shows that the magnetization dynamics of a micron-sized pattern containing a ferromagnetic vortex is determined by its handedness, or chirality. The out-of-plane magnetization in the nanometer-scale vortex core induces a three-dimensional handedness in the planar magnetic structure, leading to a precessional motion of the core parallel to a subnanosecond field pulse. The core velocity was an order of magnitude higher than expected from the static susceptibility. These results demonstrate that handedness, already well known to be important in biological systems, plays an important role in the dynamics of microscopic magnets."

The effect of iron in the Southern Ocean is particularly important because of its large area and abundant nitrate, yet iron-enhanced growth of phytoplankton may be differentially expressed between waters with high silicic acid in the south and low silicic acid in the north, where diatom growth may be limited by both silicic acid and iron. Two mesoscale experiments, designed to investigate the effects of iron enrichment in regions with high and low concentrations of silicic acid, were performed in the Southern Ocean. These experiments demonstrate iron's pivotal role in controlling carbon uptake and regulating atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide."
https://openalex.org/W2136570119,"Observations of sea surface height reveal that substantial changes have occurred over the past decade in the mid- to high-latitude North Atlantic Ocean. TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data show that subpolar sea surface height increased during the 1990s, and the geostrophic velocity derived from altimeter data exhibits declining subpolar gyre circulation. Combining the data from earlier satellites, we find that subpolar circulation may have been weaker in the late 1990s than in the late 1970s and 1980s. Direct current-meter observations in the boundary current of the Labrador Sea support the weakening circulation trend of the 1990s and, together with hydrographic data, show that the mid- to late 1990s decline extends deep in the water column. Analysis of the local surface forcing suggests that the 1990s buoyancy forcing has a dynamic effect consistent with altimetric and hydrographic observations: A weak thermohaline forcing allows the decay of the domed structure of subpolar isopycnals and weakening of circulation."

https://openalex.org/W2028893107,"A growing body of evidence concerning estrogen effects cannot be explained by the classic model of hormone action, which involves the binding to estrogen receptors (ERs) α and ERβ and the interaction of the steroid-receptor complex with specific DNA sequences associated with target genes. Using c-fos proto-oncogene expression as an early molecular sensor of estrogen action in ERα-positive MCF7 and ER-negative SKBR3 breast cancer cells, we have discovered that 17β-estradiol (E2), and the two major phytoestrogens, genistein and quercetin, stimulate c-fos expression through ERα as well as through an ER-independent manner via the G protein-coupled receptor homologue GPR30. The c-fos response is repressed in GPR30-expressing SKBR3 cells transfected with an antisense oligonucleotide against GPR30 and reconstituted in GPR30-deficient MDA-MB 231 and BT-20 breast cancer cells transfected with a GPR30 expression vector. GPR30-dependent activation of ERK1/2 by E2 and phytoestrogens occurs via a Gβγ-associated pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway that requires both Src-related and EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activities. The ability of E2 and phytoestrogens to regulate the expression of growth-related genes such as c-fos even in the absence of ER has interesting implications for understanding breast cancer progression.

Although it is often, but not always, straightforward to link the physiological effects of estrogens to the genomic model of the ligand-receptor complex activity, considerable controversy still exists on the ability of E2 to elicit transcriptional responses independently of ERα and ERβ.

For instance, it has been proposed that in breast cancer cells, E2 induces ERK phosphorylation via the orphan GPR, named GPR30 (9Filardo E.J. Quinn J.A. Bland K.I. Frackelton Jr., A.R. Mol.

In this respect, the potential of E2 to trigger different pathways that integrate cell surface signaling with gene transcription has attracted an increased interest toward the identification of agonistic or antagonistic compounds. The proto-oncogene c-fos plays a relevant role in the regulation of normal cell growth, differentiation, and cellular transformation processes (24Muller R. Biochim. Biophys.

Moreover, c-fos and other members of the fos family, such as fosB, fra-1, and fra-2, bind to sites identified in the regulatory region of target genes modulating the late response expression of critical factors for cell cycle re-entry, such as cyclin D1 (Ref. 50Brown J.R.

The transcription of c-fos is controlled by multiple cis-elements present in the gene promoter: the cAMP-response element that binds to cAMP-response element-binding protein (51Sheng M.

Further analysis demonstrated an imperfect palindromic estrogen-responsive element (ERE) within this sequence that is able to bind ERα in gel mobility shift assays but is not sufficient for transactivation (58Duan R. Porter W. Safe S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1981-1990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, it was shown that ERα must interact with Sp1 at a GC-rich site downstream from the imperfect palindromic ERE (58Duan R. Porter W. Safe S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1981-1990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a subsequent study (59Duan R. Xie W. Burghardt R.C. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11590-11598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), both growth factors and E2 seem to converge on the serum-response element. In the latter case, however, the activation by E2 involved non-genomic signaling of ERα through the MAPK signaling pathway and phosphorylation and binding of Elk-1 to the serum-response element. Herein, we show that early c-fos expression induced by E2 as well as the phytoestrogens genistein and quercetin is mediated at least in part by ERα in MCF7 breast cancer cells. However, the same agents are able to stimulate c-fos expression independently of ER expression in ER-negative breast cancer cells via GPR30. Reagents—17β-estradiol, genistein, quercetin, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, cycloheximide, wortmannin, pertussis toxin, PD 98059, LY 294002, dexamethasone, progesterone were purchased from Sigma. R1881, ICI 182780, tyrphostin AG 1478, and PP2 were obtained from AstraZeneca (Milan, Italy), Tocris Chemicals (Bristol, UK), Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc (DBA, Milan, Italy), and Calbiochem, respectively. All compounds were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide, except E2, hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), PD 98059, and LY 294002, which were dissolved in ethanol. Plasmids—The firefly luciferase reporter plasmids were c-fos and the deletion mutant c-fosΔERE (which lacks the ERE sequence) encoding –2.2-kb and –1172-bp 5′ upstream fragments of human c-fos, respectively (gifts from K.

The latter two plasmids were described together with menin in our previous study (61Gallo A. Cuozzo C. Esposito I. Maggiolini M. Bonofiglio D. Vivacqua A. Garriamone M. Weiss C. Bohmann D. Musti A.M.

Cell Culture—MCF7, MDA-MB-231, BT-20 human breast cancer cells were a gift from E. Surmacz (Philadelphia, PA), whereas SKBR3 human breast cancer cells were from Picard's laboratory (Genève, Switzerland). MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 without phenol red supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), whereas SKBR3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 without phenol red supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were switched to medium without serum 24 h before transfections, 48 h before RT-PCR or immunoblot, 72 h before the evaluation of ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation. Transfections and Luciferase Assays—A total of 100,000 MCF7 cells were plated into 24-well dishes with 500 μl of regular growth medium/well the day before transfection. The medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 lacking phenol red and serum on the day of transfection, which was performed using FuGENE 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics) with a mixture containing 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of effector plasmid where applicable, and 2 ng of pRLCMV. After 4 h, the medium was replaced again with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking phenol red and containing 1 μm of each treatment, and then cells were incubated for 5 h. Luciferase activity was measured with the dual luciferase kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Firefly luciferase values were normalized to the internal transfection control provided by the Renilla luciferase activity. The normalized relative light unit values obtained from untreated cells were set as 100%, upon which the activity induced by treatments was calculated. RT-PCR—The evaluation of gene expression was performed by semiquantitative RT-PCR as we have previously described (62Maggiolini M. Donzè O. Picard D. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For c-fos, pS2, cathepsin D, and GPR30, with 36B4 used as a control gene, the primers were: 5′-CCAACTTCATTCCCACGGTCAC-3′ (c-fos forward) and 5′-TGGCAATCTCGGTCTGCAAA-3′ (c-fos reverse); 5′-TTCTATCCTAATACCATCGACG-3′ (pS2 forward) and 5′-TTTGAGTAGTCAAAGTCAGAGC-3′ (pS2 reverse); 5′-AACAACAGGGTGGGCTTC-3′ (cathepsin D forward) and 5′-ATGCACGAAACAGATCTGTGCT-3′ (cathepsin D reverse); 5′-CTGGGGAGTTTCCTGTCTGA-3′ (GPR30 forward) and 5′-GCTTGGGAAGTCACATCCAT-3′ (GPR30 reverse); 5′-CTCAACATCTCCCCCTTCTC-3′ (36B4 forward) and 5′-CAAATCCCATATCCTCGTCC-3′ (36B4 reverse), to yield products of 381, 303, 210, 155 and 408 bp, respectively, with 20, 13, 20, 20, and 13 PCR cycles, respectively. Western Blotting—Cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and exposed to ligands for 2 or 12 h before lysis in 500 μlof 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, a mixture of protease inhibitors containing 1 mm aprotinin, 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 m sodium orthovanadate. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Sigma). Equal amounts of whole protein extract were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), probed overnight at 4 °C with the antibodies against c-fos, β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and pERK1/2, ERK2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, Celbio, Milan, Italy) and then revealed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotide Experiments—Antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized as described (63O'Dowd B.F. Nguyen T Marchese A. Cheng R. Lynch K.R. Heng H.H. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. George S.R.

Al-Azzawi F. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2001; 11: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and purchased from MWG (Florence, Italy). The oligonucleotides used were: 5′-TTGGGAAGTCACATCCAT-3′ for GPR30; and 5′-GATCTCAGCACGGCAAAT-3′ for the scrambled control (66Kanda N. Watanabe S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 771-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For antisense experiments, a concentration of 200 nm of the indicated oligonucleotides was transfected following the procedure described above. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls testing to determine differences in means. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. E2, Genistein, and Quercetin Transactivate c-fos Promoter Constructs in MCF7 Cells—In our previous study (4Maggiolini M. Bonofiglio D. Marsico S. Panno M.L. Cenni B. Picard D. Andò S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 595-602PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrated that an ERE reporter gene transfected in MCF7 cells responds to genistein and quercetin, like E2, through an ERα-mediated mechanism. Thus, in the present study, we first examined whether transiently transfected full-length human c-fos promoter (–2.2 kb) could respond to these phytoestrogens as reported previously for E2 (67Weisz A. Rosales R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5097-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A demonstrates that genistein and quercetin mirror E2 activity. Activation by all three compounds is sensitive to the MAPK inhibitor PD 98059 and is unaffected by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (or LY 294002, not shown). In our previous investigation (61Gallo A. Cuozzo C. Esposito I. Maggiolini M. Bonofiglio D. Vivacqua A. Garriamone M. Weiss C. Bohmann D. Musti A.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6434-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we showed that the nuclear protein encoded by the tumor suppressor gene MEN1, named menin, inhibits ERK-dependent phosphorylation and activation of the ternary complex factor member Elk-1, which regulates c-fos gene expression. Therefore, we evaluated the action of menin on the transactivation property of estrogenic compounds using the above mentioned c-fos promoter assay and a corresponding reporter gene assay for monitoring the activation of Gal4-Elk-1. As expected, luciferase activity of both constructs was reversed in the presence of menin (Fig. 1, A and B). The transactivation of Elk-1 by E2 and phytoestrogens confirmed its involvement in c-fos expression, whereas the inhibitory effects of PD 98059 indicated that a MAPK-dependent mechanism is required for such a response (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the transcriptional potential of these compounds was maintained using a mutant of the c-fos promoter lacking the ERE region (–1172 bp), suggesting that other pathways, not requiring an ERα-ERE interaction, contribute to c-fos transactivation.

To evaluate whether phytoestrogens mimic E2 in this regard and in the activation of the two well known target genes pS2 and cathepsin D (77Cavailles V. Garcia M. Rochefort H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we performed a semiquantitative RT-PCR comparing the mRNA levels after standardization on the housekeeping gene encoding the ribosomal protein 36B4. A treatment for only 1 h with E2 and phytoestrogens up-regulated c-fos expression in ERα-positive MCF7 cells (Fig. 2A). The same results were obtained for pS2 and cathepsin D with a 12-h exposure, whereas c-fos returned to levels resembling those of untreated cells (Fig. 2B). E2, Genistein, and Quercetin Up-regulate c-fos Protein Levels in MCF7 Cells—The aforementioned results prompted us to evaluate whether c-fos protein levels follow the mRNA increase observed after a short (2-h) treatment of ERα-positive MCF7 cells.

https://openalex.org/W1966422114,"We have explored CD44 (a hyaluronan (HA) receptor) interaction with a Na+-H+ exchanger (NHE1) and hyaluronidase-2 (Hyal-2) during HA-induced cellular signaling in human breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231 cell line). Immunological analyses demonstrate that CD44s (standard form) and two signaling molecules (NHE1 and Hyal-2) are closely associated in a complex in MDA-MB-231 cells. These three proteins are also significantly enriched in cholesterol and ganglioside-containing lipid rafts, characterized as caveolin and flotillin-rich plasma membrane microdomains. The binding of HA to CD44 activates Na+-H+ exchange activity which, in turn, promotes intracellular acidification and creates an acidic extracellular matrix environment. This leads to Hyal-2-mediated HA catabolism, HA modification, and cysteine proteinase (cathepsin B) activation resulting in breast tumor cell invasion. In addition, we have observed the following: (i) HA/CD44-activated Rho kinase (ROK) mediates NHE1 phosphorylation and activity, and (ii) inhibition of ROK or NHE1 activity (by treating cells with a ROK inhibitor, Y27632, or NHE1 blocker, S-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride, respectively) blocks NHE1 phosphorylation/Na+-H+ exchange activity, reduces intracellular acidification, eliminates the acidic environment in the extracellular matrix, and suppresses breast tumor-specific behaviors (e.g. Hyal-2-mediated HA modification, cathepsin B activation, and tumor cell invasion). Finally, down-regulation of CD44 or Hyal-2 expression (by treating cells with CD44 or Hyal-2-specific small interfering RNAs) not only inhibits HA-mediated CD44 signaling (e.g. ROK-mediated Na+-H+ exchanger reaction and cellular pH changes) but also impairs oncogenic events (e.g. Hyal-2 activity, hyaluronan modification, cathepsin B activation, and tumor cell invasion). Taken together, our results suggest that CD44 interaction with a ROK-activated NHE1 (a Na+-H+ exchanger) in cholesterol/ganglioside-containing lipid rafts plays a pivotal role in promoting intracellular/extracellular acidification required for Hyal-2 and cysteine proteinase-mediated matrix degradation and breast cancer progression.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3601-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The fact that CD44 is fatty acid-acylated (35Bourguignon L.Y.W. Kalomiris E.L. Lokeshwar V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11761-11765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that up to 40% of total cellular CD44 is co-localized with caveolin in lipid rafts (36Ilangumaran S. Briol A. Hoessli D.C. Blood. 1998; 91: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that acylation is critical for promoting CD44 accumulation into lipid rafts (33Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). However, the role of CD44-containing lipid rafts in regulating HA signaling is only now beginning to be elucidated. Tumor invasion and metastasis are the major causes of treatment failure for cancer patients (37Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer: Principles & Practice of Oncology. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1993: 134-149Google Scholar). These processes are often associated with acidification of the tumor microenvironment (38Martin G.R. Jain R.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5670-5674PubMed Google Scholar). For example, mammary cancer cells acidify the extracellular environment more effectively than normal mammary cells (40Kallinowski F. Vaupel P. Runkel S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 7264-7272PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, metastatic breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231 cells) have been observed to develop acidic microenvironments (41Montcourrier P. Silver I. Farnoud R. Bird I. Rochefort H. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1997; 15: 382-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is clear that the mechanisms responsible for acidification-related tumor progression are quite complex, involving a number of biochemical and cellular events. It is known that lactate secretion by tumor cells is one of the important factors in the acidification of the immediate microenvironment of primary tumors (42Webb S.D. Sherratt J.A. Fish R.G. J. Theor. Biol. 1999; 196: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, because primary mouse tumors derived from cells lacking lactate dehydrogenase are also capable of acidifying the tumor microenvironment (43Yamagata M. Hasuda K. Stamato T. Tannock I.F. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 77: 1726-1731Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar), other mechanism(s) must be involved in regulating extracellular acidification during tumor progression. In this regard, a number of studies have been carried out to identify molecules expressed by tumor cells that correlate with the regulation of pH changes. The Na+-H+ exchanger (NHE) is among the possible candidates, a ubiquitous membrane protein known to regulate cellular pH (44Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). There are a number of NHE isoforms encoded by different genes (45Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 46Counillon L. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). One of the most widely distributed isoforms of NHE is called NHE1, which catalyzes the extrusion of intracellular proton (H+) ions in exchange for extracellular (Na+) ions, thereby regulating intracellular pH (44Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Veech R.L. Griffiths J.R. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 49Hopkins D.M. Morris J.A. Oates K. Huddart H. Staff W.G. J. Pathol. 1992; 166: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) indicate that NHE1 is one of the principal intracellular pH regulatory molecules in breast tumor cells. NHE1 also appears to be involved in the aberrant regulation of both extracellular pH (pHe) and intracellular pH (pHi) in human breast tumor cells under nutrient-depleted conditions (50Reshkin S.J. Bellizzi A. Albarani V. Guerra L. Tommasino M. Paradiso A. Casavola V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5361-5369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Some observations on the localization and regulation of certain NHE isoforms suggest that there are connections between NHE activity and cholesterolenriched lipid rafts (51Bullis B.L. Carmen X.L. Rieder C.V. Singh D.N. Berthiaume L.G. Fliegel L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4887-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 52Poli de Figueiredo C.E. Ng L.L. Davis J.E. Lucio-Cazana F.J. Ellory J.C. Hendry B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C1138-C1142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most interesting, NHE1 also serves as one of the cellular substrates for RhoA-activated Rho kinase (ROK) (53Tominaga T. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Barber D.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). NHE1 phosphorylation by RhoA-activated ROK induces actin stress fiber assembly (53Tominaga T. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Barber D.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The question of whether HA/CD44-activated RhoA-ROK signaling plays any role in regulating NHE1 activity and cellular pH changes during breast tumor cell invasion is the focus of this study. Low pH environment promotes tumor cell-specific behaviors including activation of ECM-degrading enzymes for tumor cell invasion (54Chambers A.F. Matrisian L.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar, 55Duffy M.J. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1992; 10: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 56Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). In fact, extracellular acidity plays an important role in activating ECM-degrading enzymes including cysteine proteinases such as cathepsin B (54Chambers A.F. Matrisian L.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar, 55Duffy M.J. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1992; 10: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 56Mignatti P.

Sanders Scientific Publications, London1990: 127-136Google Scholar). In general, cathepsin B is secreted in a latent form that requires activation at low pH. Malignant tumor progression correlates with increased levels of the activated cathepsin B (54Chambers A.F. Matrisian L.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar, 55Duffy M.J. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1992; 10: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 56Mignatti P.

Sanders Scientific Publications, London1990: 127-136Google Scholar). Another acid-active ECM-degrading enzyme is the mammalian hyaluronidases such as hyaluronidase-2 (Hyal-2), which is present in virtually all tissues (58Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Kreil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22466-22470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 59Strobl B. Wechselberger C. Beier D.R. Lepperdinger G. Genomics. 1998; 53: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Hyal-2 belongs to a family of endo-N-acetylhexosaminidases that hydrolyze HA and to a lesser extent chondroitin sulfates (58Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Kreil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22466-22470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 59Strobl B. Wechselberger C. Beier D.R. Lepperdinger G.

It is a cell surface enzyme via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage to the plasma membrane (60Lepperdinger G. Mullegger J. Kreil G. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 61Rai S.K. Duh F.M. Vigdorovich V. Danilkovitch-Miagkova L erman M.I. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4443-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of Hyal-2 is up-regulated in acidic compartments derived from invaginated plasma membrane microdomains such as lipid rafts (60Lepperdinger G. Mullegger J. Kreil G. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 61Rai S.K. Duh F.M. Vigdorovich V. Danilkovitch-Miagkova L erman M.I. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4443-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Activated Hyal-2 hydrolyzes high molecular mass HA into intermediate sized fragments of ∼20 kDa corresponding to about 50 disaccharide units (58Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Kreil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22466-22470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Most interesting, fragments of such size stimulate inflammatory cytokine synthesis (62Nobel P.W. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Hyal-2 in murine astrocytoma cells accelerates intracerebral but not subcutaneous tumor formation and invasion (63Novak U. Stylli S.S. Kaye A.H. Lepperdinger G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6246-6250PubMed Google Scholar). Hyal-2 also functions as a receptor for the jaagsiekte sheep retroviruses (61Rai S.K. Duh F.M. Vigdorovich V. Danilkovitch-Miagkova L erman M.I. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4443-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In this system, Hyal-2 negatively regulates receptor tyrosine kinase (64Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Duh F.M. Kuzmin I. Angeloni D. Liu S.L. Miller A.D. Lerman M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 100: 4580-4585Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and mediates tumor cell transformation by jaagsiekte sheep retroviruses in lung cancers (61Rai S.K. Duh F.M. Vigdorovich V. Danilkovitch-Miagkova L erman M.I. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4443-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Clearly, Hyal-2 is closely associated with tumor progression. In this study we have described a novel CD44 interaction with NHE1 and Hyal-2 in lipid rafts, leading to intracellular/extracellular acidification, HA modification, cathepsin B activation, and breast tumor cell invasion. This new information can provide new insights toward a better understanding of HA-CD44 signaling-regulated malignancy of solid tumor cancers such as breast cancers. Cell Culture—The breast tumor cell line (MDA-MB-231 cells) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with Earle's salt solution, essential and nonessential amino acids, vitamins, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Antibodies and Reagents—Monoclonal rat anti-CD44 antibody (clone, 020; isotype, IgG2b; obtained from CMB-TECH, Inc., San Francisco) recognizes a common determinant of the HA binding region of CD44 isoforms including CD44s, CD44E, and CD44 variant species. This rat anti-CD44 was routinely used for HA-related blocking experiments. Polyclonal rabbit anti-CD44s antibody, which was raised against a unique N-/O-glycosylated moiety of 85-kDa CD44s, is mono-specific for most of the glycosylated CD44s expressed on the cell surface and displays no cross-reactivity to other CD44 isoforms (e.g. CD44E or CD44 variant species). This reagent was routinely used for immunoblotting experiments. Rabbit anti-Rho kinase (ROK) was prepared according to procedures described previously (13Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Shao L. Zhu D. Chen Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For the preparation of polyclonal rabbit anti-Hyal-2 antibody, specific synthetic peptides (∼15–17 amino acids unique for the Hyal-2 sequence) were prepared by the Peptide Laboratories by using an Advanced ChemTech automatic synthesizer (model ACT350). All polyclonal antibodies were prepared by using conventional DEAE-cellulose chromatography and were tested to be monospecific (by immunoblot assays). Rabbit anti-phosphothreonine antibody and rabbit anti-phosphoserine antibody were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.(South San Francisco, CA). Monoclonal mouse anti-caveolin, mouse anti-flotillin-1, and mouse anti-florillin-2 were purchased from BD Biosciences. Other immunoreagents such as rabbit anti-NHE1 were purchased from Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX). High molecular weight HA polymers (∼500,000–1,000,000-dalton polymers) were purified by gel filtration column chromatography using Sephacryl S1000 columns. The purity of high molecular weight HA polymers used in our experiments was further verified by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography. No small HA fragments were detected in these preparations. Y27632 and CA-074-Me were purchased from Calbiochem. EIPA was obtained from Sigma. Escherichia coli-derived GST-tagged RhoA was a gift from Dr. Martin Schwartz (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Both nigericin and PH 20 hyaluronidase were obtained from Sigma. In the Hiprep™ Sephacryl™ 400 HR (S-400HR, from Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration analyses, three protein markers such as catalase (232,000 daltons), ferritin (440,000 daltons), thyroglobulin (669,000 daltons) (Amersham Biosciences) plus two polysaccharide size standards including Healon HA (500,000 daltons) (prepared according to the procedures described by McKee et al. (18McKee C.M. Penno M.B. Cowman M. Burdick M.D. Strieter R.M. Bao C. Nobel P.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2403-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar)) and purified HA fragment (280,000 daltons) (ICN Biomedicals) were used. For agarose gel analyses, both Select-HA™ LoLadder (in the range of ∼27,000 to ∼500,000 daltons) and Select-HA™ HiLadder (in the range of ∼500,000 to 1,500,000 daltons) obtained from Hyalose (Oklahoma City, OK) were used as HA standards. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—For the detection of Hyal-2 transcript expression, ∼3 μg of total RNA isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells was used for RT-PCR analysis using Superscript™ One-step RT-PCR with PlatinumR Taq system (Invitrogen). Two Hyal-2-specific primers (5′-GAATATTACCATCTTCTACCGCGA-3′ and 5′-CCAGGACACATTGACCACGTA-3′) were designed for this study. For loading controls, two GAPDH primers (5′-CATCCATGACAACTTTGGTATCGTG-3′ and 5′-GAGCTTGACAAAGTGGTCGTTGA-3′) were also used. The reactions were cycled after an initial 2 min of denaturation at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR products (∼859 bp for Hyal-2, and ∼442 bp for GAPDH) were analyzed using a 2.0% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. As controls, RT-PCR was carried out in the absence of Superscript II reverse transcriptase or in the absence of template in the PCR mixture. No amplification products were detected in these control samples. Preparations of CD44siRNA and Hyal-2si RNA—The siRNA sequence targeting human CD44 or Hyal-2 (from mRNA sequence, Gen-Bank™ accession number AJ251595) corresponds to the coding region relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon. Target sequences were selected using the software developed by Ambion Inc., UK. As recommended by Ambion, CD44 or Hyal-2-specific targeted regions were selected beginning 50–100 nucleotides downstream from the start codon. Sequences close to 50% G/C content were chosen. Specifically, CD44 target sequence 1 (5′-AAAAATGGTCGCTACAGCATC-3′), CD44 target sequence 2 (5′-AATAGCACCTTGCCCACAATG-3′), and scrambled sequences (5′-AAAAACGGTAGATGCATCAGC-3′) were used. Hyal-2 target sequence 1 (5′-AAGATGCTGCAGAAACGTGTG-3′), Hyal-2 target sequence 2 (5′-AAACGTGTGGAGCACTACATT-3′), and scrambled sequences (5′-AAAGTGCGTGAAGCAATTCGG-3′) were used. CD44 or Hyal-2-specific target sequences were then aligned to the human genome data base in a BLAST search to eliminate sequences with sig"
https://openalex.org/W2117196163,"APJ is a G-protein-coupled receptor with seven transmembrane domains, and its endogenous ligand, apelin, was identified recently. They are highly expressed in the cardiovascular system, suggesting that APJ is important in the regulation of blood pressure. To investigate the physiological functions of APJ, we have generated mice lacking the gene encoding APJ. The base-line blood pressure of APJ-deficient mice is equivalent to that of wild-type mice in the steady state. The administration of apelin transiently decreased the blood pressure of wild-type mice and a hypertensive model animal, a spontaneously hypertensive rat. On the other hand, this hypotensive response to apelin was abolished in APJ-deficient mice. This apelin-induced response was inhibited by pretreatment with a nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor, and apelin-induced phosphorylation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase in lung endothelial cells from APJ-deficient mice disappeared. In addition, APJ-deficient mice showed an increased vasopressor response to the most potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, and the base-line blood pressure of double mutant mice homozygous for both APJ and angiotensin-type 1a receptor was significantly elevated compared with that of angiotensin-type 1a receptor-deficient mice. These results demonstrate that APJ exerts the hypotensive effect in vivo and plays a counterregulatory role against the pressor action of angiotensin II.

A family of G protein-coupled receptors bind a large variety of ligands and plays an essential role for physiological functions in vivo including the maintenance of homeostasis in the cardiovascular system. APJ (a putative receptor protein related to the angiotensin-type 1 receptor (AT1)) 1The abbreviations used are: AT1, angiotensin-type 1 receptor; WKY, Wistar-Kyoto; SHR, spontaneously hypertensive rat; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NO, nitric oxide; eNOS, endothelial NO synthase; l-NAME, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. is a G protein-coupled receptor that was isolated from human genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (1O'Dowd B.F.

The APJ has a 31% amino acid sequence homology with the AT1, but APJ does not display specific binding for angiotensin II, which is the ligand of AT1 and exerts a pressor action in the blood pressure regulation (1O'Dowd B.F. Heiber M. Chan A. Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Kennedy J.L. Shi X. Petronis A. George S.R. Nguyen T. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Recently, the endogenous ligand of APJ was identified from bovine stomach, and this peptide was named apelin (for APJ endogenous ligand) (2Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T.

APJ and apelin are expressed in several tissues including the cardiovascular and the central nervous systems (3Hosoya M. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Fujii R. Habata Y. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Honda S.

On the other hand, apelin potently contracts human saphenous vein smooth muscle cells in vitro (10Katugampola S.D. Maguire J.J. Matthewson S.R. Davenport A.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), indicating that apelin is a potent vasoconstrictor. Thus, at this moment, the action of apelin in blood pressure regulation is controversial, and it is still unclear whether these actions of apelin are really through APJ because of the absence of specific receptor blocker to clarify the in vivo functions of APJ. Therefore, in this study, by using animal models such as APJ-deficient mice, APJ/AT1a double knock-out mice, and spontaneously hypertensive rat and by using endothelial cells from mice, we evaluated the functional importance of apelin-APJ signaling in the blood pressure regulation in vitro and in vivo. Gene Targeting and Generation of Mutant Mice—The genomic DNA containing the APJ locus were isolated from a phage library from C57BL/6 mice (11Sugaya T. Nishimatsu S. Tanimoto K. Takimoto E.

To construct a targeting vector for the APJ gene, the 156-bp fragment of the mouse APJ gene between the NcoI site including the translation initiation codon of the gene and the Csp45I site was replaced with the nuclear localization signal-lacZ cassette. The neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene cassette derived from pMC1neoPolyA (Stratagene) was placed downstream of the nuclear localization signal-lacZ gene. The 6.3-kb XhoI/NcoI fragment and the 1.6-kb Csp45I/Sau3AI fragment of the APJ gene were included upstream and downstream of these cassettes, respectively (Fig. 1A). Details of the negative selection with the diphtheria toxin-A cassette are described elsewhere (12Yagi T. Nada S. Watanabe N. Tamemoto H. Kohmura N. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Anal.

Homologous recombination in TT2 ES cells was detected by Southern blotting using probe a (687-bp BanIII-Sau3AI fragment). Chimeric mice were generated by injecting the ES cells into ICR 8-cell embryos (13Yagi T. Tokunaga T. Furuta Y. Nada S. Yoshida M. Tsukada T. Saga Y. Takeda N. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Anal.

Double knock-out mice for APJ and AT1a used in this study were generated from heterozygous mice after the crossing of single APJ-deficient and AT1a-deficient mice. RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from the heart and lung of four independent age-matched mice using ISOGEN (NipponGene) (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63196) Google Scholar). Fifteen micrograms of RNA were denatured with glyoxal, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to a nylon membrane. The 728-bp NcoI/NaeI fragment that corresponds to the coding regions of APJ was used as the APJ receptor-specific probe (probe b). Probes for mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were described previously (16Miyagishi M. Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 27-31PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of Blood Pressure—The heart rate and systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressures were measured by a programmable sphygmomanometer (BP-200, Softron, Japan) using the tail cuff method as described previously (17Fukamizu A. Sugimura K. Takimoto E. Sugiyama F. Seo M.S. Takahashi S. Hatae T. Kajiwara N. Yagami K. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11617-11621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unanesthetized mice were introduced into a holder mounted in a thermostatically controlled warning plate and maintained at 37 °C during measurement. Intraperitoneal Injection of Apelin—Experiments were performed using 4-month-old male mice under the conscious and unrestrained conditions. [Pyr1]Apelin-13 (Peptide Institute 4361-v) was suspended in saline (0.9% NaCl in distilled water). After the measurement of the basal systolic blood pressure, [Pyr1]apelin-13 was administered by intraperitoneal injection at 285 μg/kg body weight and the systolic blood pressure was measured continuously. The data were calculated at 5-min intervals for 20 min after the administration of apelin. Intravenous Injection of Apelin in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) Rat and SHR—SHR and WKY rats at 12 weeks of age were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (35 mg/kg intraperitoneal). PE-10 catheters (Clay Adams, Parsippany, NJ) were inserted into the right femoral artery for measuring blood pressure and into the right femoral vain for allowing the administration of [Pyr1]apelin-13. The arterial catheter was connected to a pressure transducer (TP-200T, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan), and blood pressure was measured continuously. The anesthetic level was maintained by subcutaneous injection of 10 mg/kg pentobarbital every 40 min. [Pyr1]Apelin-13 dissolved in 0.1 ml of saline was administered through the vein catheter (2, 4, and 10 nmol/kg). Pretreatment with NG-Nitro-l-Arginine Methyl Ester (l-NAME) and Intraperitoneal Injection of Apelin in Wild-type and APJ-deficient Mice—Experiments were performed using 4-month-old male mice under the conscious and unrestrained conditions. l-NAME (Sigma) was suspended in saline. Systolic blood pressure was continuously measured before and after acute intraperitoneal injection of l-NAME (10 mg/kg body weight). At 15 min after the administration of l-NAME, the additional administration of [Pyr1]apelin-13 (285 μg/kg body weight) or saline alone was performed by intraperitoneal injection and the systolic blood pressure was measured continuously. The maxima of systolic blood pressure responses to injections of apelin were calculated in a 0–5 min-post-injection of apelin. Preparation of Endothelial Cells from Wild-type and APJ-deficient Mice—The lung of wild-type and APJ-deficient male mice at 11 weeks of age was perfused with 0.25% heparin/phosphate-buffered saline(-) and removed aseptically, rinsed in 0.25% heparin/phosphate-buffered saline(-), minced into ∼1 × 2-mm squares, and digested in 20 ml of collagenase type I (4 mg/ml, Worthington) in serum-free DMEM containing antibiotic at 37 °C for 60 min with shaking. The cellular digest was filtered through a sterile 40-μm nylon mesh and washed in 20 ml of serum-free DMEM, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of serum-free DMEM. 2 ml of cell suspension were put into the tube containing 12 ml of 30% Percoll and centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min. 2 ml of the concentrated fraction with the endothelial cells were recovered to which 2 ml of serum-free DMEM were added, and then the Percoll density gradient centrifugation was carried out again. The collected endothelial cells then were resuspended in 4 ml of growth medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and endothelial cell growth supplement from bovine neural tissue (Sigma)) for culture. Contaminated vascular smooth muscle cells were stripped off physically as necessary. Confluent cells were passed routinely at a split ratio of 1–3 after trypsin/EDTA digestion and cultured under the same conditions. We ascertained the purity of endothelial cells by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-mouse CD-31 antibody (BD Biosciences) (data not shown). Detection of Endothelial NO Synthase (eNOS) Phosphorylation—Isolated endothelial cells from wild-type and APJ-deficient mice were cultured in 6-well plates and stimulated by [Pyr1]apelin-13 (10 μm) or fetal bovine serum (10%) for 5 min, and the reaction was terminated by adding Laemmli buffer. The cell lysates were subjected to SDS/7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After blocking with a blocking buffer containing 5% milk, the membrane was incubated with a polyclonal anti-human phospho-eNOS (Ser1177) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and bound antibody was detected by horseradish peroxydase-labeled donkey anti-(rabbit IgG) serum (Amersham Biosciences) using Western Lightning Plus chemiluminescence reagents (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) to measure the phosphorylation of eNOS. After washing with a reprobing buffer of the composition (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS), the same membrane was subjected to Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-eNOS antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) to detect the expression levels of eNOS as an internal control. Treatment with Captopril and Intraperitoneal Injection of Angiotensin II—Systolic blood pressure was measured in conscious and unrestrained female mice at 4 months of age as mentioned above. The basal systolic blood pressure and the pressure responses against intraperitoneal injection of angiotensin II (10 and 30 μg/kg) were measured prior to the administration of captopril. After the administration of captopril (500 mg/liter in drinking water) for 1 week to inhibit the endogenous production of angiotensin II, the pressure responses to angiotensin II given from lower dose (3–30 μg/kg) were recorded continuously for 40 min after the administration of angiotensin II. Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed by Student's t test for unpaired values. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Generation of APJ-deficient Mice—To generate a null mutation at the mouse APJ gene locus, we designed a targeting vector that would replace a portion of the APJ coding region with the promoterless lacZ gene (Fig, 1A). After electroporation of TT2 cells with the targeting vector, homologous recombination was confirmed by Southern blotting (Fig. 1B, left panel). 10 independent cell lines of 195 G418-resistant cells had undergone homologous recombination at the mouse APJ locus. Eight clones were injected into ICR 8-cell embryos to generate chimeric mice, and two clones gave rise to germ line transmission by backcross mating with C57BL/6J mice. The heterozygous mice were intercrossed to produce homozygous offspring, and the mutation at APJ loci was detected by Southern analysis of tail DNA (Fig. 1B, right panel). Of the 396 offspring analyzed, 76 (19%) were homologous for the disrupted allele and 103 (26%) were wild type, indicating the normal embryonic development of the homozygous mutant mice. The histological sections of heart, lung, kidney, spleen, brain, ovary, skeletal muscle, liver, and white adipose did not reveal any differences in morphology between wild-type and heterozygous or homozygous mutant mice (data not shown). In the following study, to gain the equivalent effects of other gene backgrounds with the exception of for the APJ gene, we used these intercrossed littermates of heterozygous mice for further physiological experiments. RNA Analysis—To determine whether APJ message was present in homozygous mutants, we performed Northern blot analysis of heart and lung RNA. Although heart and lung highly express the APJ gene in rodents (3Hosoya M. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Fujii R. Habata Y. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Honda S. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Nishimura O. Fujino M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21061-21067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), homozygous mutant mice had no detectable APJ message (Fig. 1C). A duplicate blot was analyzed with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe to confirm that the RNA sample was intact. These results indicated that APJ transcripts were absent completely from homozygous mutant mice (APJ-deficient mice). Measurement of Blood Pressure and Administration of Apelin—To ascertain whether APJ-mediated pathways participate in the regulation of the cardiovascular system, we measured the systolic blood pressure and heart rate under the steady state. As shown in Fig. 2A, APJ-deficient mice and wild-type mice did not show any difference in the base-line systolic blood pressure (106.7 ± 2.0 and 105.9 ± 2.5 mm Hg, respectively) and the heart rate (632.0 ± 19.2 and 616.1 ± 32.8 cpm, respectively), suggesting that APJ is not essential for the maintenance of base-line blood pressure. Furthermore, it is reported that apelin is concerned in the regulation of drinking behavior (5Reaux A. De Mota N. Skultetyova I. Lenkei Z. El Messari S. Gallatz K. Corvol P. Palkovits M.

It has been reported that blood pressure was decreased transiently by the systemic administration of apelin, the endogenous ligand of APJ, in rat (5Reaux A. De Mota N. Skultetyova I. Lenkei Z.

We administered apelin to APJ-deficient mice to ascertain whether these actions of apelin are really through APJ. Apelin is derived from a 77-amino acid precursor and processed to several isoforms by deleting the amino terminus (3Hosoya M. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Fujii R. Habata Y. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Honda S.

The pyroglutamylated form of apelin-13, [pGlu]apelin-13, has been reported to have the effective activity at the receptor in vitro (3Hosoya M. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Fujii R. Habata Y. Hinuma S.

Conscious male mice were intraperitoneally injected with [pGlu]apelin-13. The acute administration of apelin transiently and significantly decreased in the systolic blood pressure of wild-type mice (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the apelin injection revealed no change in systolic blood pressure of APJ-deficient mice (Fig. 2C) without a change in heart rate as well as that of wild-type mice (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that the systemic administration of apelin lowers the blood pressure in wild-type but not in APJ-deficient mice and that APJ is really responsible for this action of apelin on the blood pressure regulation. Administration of Apelin to Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat—Given that the activation of the apelin-APJ signaling pathways lowers the blood pressure under the steady state in mice (Fig. 2B) and rats (5Reaux A. De Mota N. Skultetyova I. Lenkei Z. El Messari S. Gallatz K. Corvol P. Palkovits M. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 7Lee D.K. Cheng R.

Pharmacol. 2003; 470: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), is the hypotensive effect also evoked in the hypertensive conditions? To address this question, we administered apelin intravenously to a chronic hypertensive model animal, SHR, and measured continuously the arterial blood pressure. WKY rats were used as a control. Before the administration of apelin, the base-line mean blood pressure of WKY rats and SHR was measured (77 ± 4 mm Hg, n = 10, and 117 ± 2 mm Hg, n = 9, respectively). When apelin was injected into the normotensive WKY rats, a dose-dependent and significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure was elicited (Fig. 2D, closed bar) as reported previously (5Reaux A. De Mota N. Skultetyova I. Lenkei Z. El Messari S. Gallatz K. Corvol P. Palkovits M. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 7Lee D.K. Cheng R.

Pharmacol. 2003; 470: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The intravenous administration of apelin to SHR was found to significantly lower the mean arterial blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D, open bar). Thus, the hypotensive effect by the systemic administration of apelin was evoked in hypertensive animals, but the degree of decrement was less than that of WKY rats. The effects of apelin on blood pressure regulation in the hypertensive model animals have not been explored previously to date, although it has been recently reported that apelin-APJ signaling pathways were down-regulated in the mechanical stretch models in vitro, in the animal models of chronic ventricular pressure overload, and in patients with chronic heart failure in vivo (19Szokodi I. Tavi P. Foldes G. Voutilainen-Myllyla S. Ilves M. Tokola H. Pikkarainen S. Piuhola J. Rysa J. Toth M. Ruskoaho H. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 20Foldes G.

In addition, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase (ACE2), a zinc metalloprotease whose closest homolog is the angiotensin I-converting enzyme, was identified as the breakdown enzyme for apelin peptides (22Vickers C. Hales P. Kaushik V. Dick L. Gavin J. Tang J. Godbout K. Parsons T. Baronas E. Hsieh F. Acton S. Patane M. Nichols A. Tummino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14838-14843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). The reduction of apelin-induced hypotensive effects in SHR compared with WKY rats might be attributed to the differences in the balance of the production and degradation of apelin and in the sensitivity of APJ-mediated intracellular signalings including receptor desensitization. Effects of a Nitric Oxide Synthase Inhibitor on the Action of Apelin Administration—Tatemoto et al. (8Tatemoto K. Takayama K. Zou M.X. Kumaki I. Zhang W. Kumano K. Fujimiya M. Regul. Pept. 2001; 99: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) suggest that apelin causes vasodilatation via the activation of the nitric oxide (NO)/l-arginine system. NO generated by eNOS has a central role in the regulation of vascular tone. Therefore, we examined the effects of a nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor, l-NAME, against the depressor response of apelin-APJ signaling observed in wild-type mice. After a single intraperitoneal bolus injection (10 mg/kg body weight) of l-NAME, the systolic blood pressure increased similarly from 111.0 ± 2.2 to 142.3 ± 2.9 mm Hg and from 108.1 ± 2.4 to 142.4 ± 2.5 mm Hg in wild-type and APJ-deficient mice (n = 7–8/group), respectively. This increase in systolic blood pressure with the administration of l-NAME was described previously in rat, and the systolic blood pressure of each group reached a plateau at around 10 min after administration (data not shown). Accordingly, we injected the apelin peptide at 15 min after l-NAME administration. The injection of apelin induced an acute and transient decrease in systolic blood pressure in the non-treated wild-type mice. In contrast, the administration of the same dose of apelin caused almost no change in systolic blood pressure in wild-type mice pretreated with l-NAME (Fig. 3A, closed bar). The systolic blood pressure in APJ-deficient mice was not changed by the apelin peptide injection regardless of l-NAME administration (Fig. 3A, opened bar), suggesting that the suppressive action point of l-NAME against the hypotensive effect observed in wild-type mice by apelin injection exists under the APJ-mediated signalings. Tatemoto et al. (8Tatemoto K. Takayama K. Zou M.X. Kumaki I. Zhang W. Kumano K. Fujimiya M. Regul. Pept. 2001; 99: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) also report that the systemic administration of apelin significantly increased the plasma NOx concentration in rats, whereas the increase in the NOx concentration was not observed in the rats pretreated with l-NAME. These findings provided a possibility that the depressor action of apelin-APJ signaling is the result of stimulation of the NO production. Apelin-mediated Ser1176 eNOS Phosphorylation in Endothelial Cells from Mice—NO produced by eNOS has a crucial role in the regulation of vascular tone. It was reported that eNOS is activated by a variety of physiological and pathophysiological stimuli, including hormones and growth factors, and by mechanical stimuli. eNOS is activated by phosphorylation at the Ser1177 residue (based on the human eNOS sequence and is equivalent to bovine eNOS-Ser1179 and mouse eNOS-Ser1176), the best characterized eNOS phosphorylation site, that is phosphorylated by protein kinase Akt, a downstream mediator of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and greatly contributes to the eNOS activation (23Michell B.J. Griffiths J.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Tiganis T. Bozinovski S. de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 845-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 24Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C.

Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar). To determine whether apelin-APJ signaling can actually activate eNOS, the endothelial cells derived from wild-type and APJ-deficient mice were stimulated with apelin and phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1176 residue was assessed by using a phosphorylation state-specific eNOS antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, eNOS in the endothelial cells from wild-type and APJ-deficient mice was activated significantly by serum stimulation (gray bar) compared with non-treated cells (open bar). Interestingly, eNOS Ser1176 phosphorylation by apelin stimulation was promoted in wild-type endothelial cells but not in APJ-deficient endothelial cells (closed bar). This is the first report that apelin can activate eNOS in endothelial cells and that APJ plays a critical role in apelin-induced phosphorylation of eNOS, which potentializes the hypotensive effect on blood pressure regulation. Association of Mouse APJ with Pressor Action of Angiotensin II—In blood pressure regulation, the vasoconstriction and vasorelaxation systems constantly antagonized each other to maintain normal blood pressure. To test whether APJ plays a role in blood pressure regulation as a counterregulatory component against vasopressor actions, we performed the systemic angiotensin II administration and measured the systolic blood pressure of wild-type and APJ-deficient mice. The intraperitoneal injection of pharmacological doses of angiotensin II (10 and 30 μg/kg) resulted in a similar increase in systolic blood pressure in both groups (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the pressor response mediated by AT1 in the steady state was not affected by the disruption of the APJ gene. We next used a different protocol for angiotensin II administration to clarify the APJ function in blood pressure regulation. Hein et al. (26Hein L. Barsh G.S. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Kobilka B.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) previously evaluated the role of angiotensin-type 2 receptor (AT2) in blood pressure regulation as a counterregulatory component against vasopressor actions by administrating captopril to AT2-deficient mice. We pretreated mice with captopril, the inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, for 1 week to block the production of endogenous angiotensin II and then continuously injected lower and more physiological doses of angiotensin II. The captopril-treated wild-type mice revealed an increased systolic blood pressure by the intraperitoneal injection of angiotensin II (above 10 μg/kg). On the contrary, the captopril-treated APJ-deficient mice revealed a significant increased sensitivity to low dose angiotensin II (3 and 10 μg/kg) compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 4A, captopril). In making another attempt to clarify a role of APJ in blood pressure regulations, we generated double knock-out mice for APJ and AT1a by crossing APJ-deficient and AT1a-deficient mice. As shown in Fig. 4B, AT1a-deficient mice displayed marked hypotension compared with that of wild-type mice as described previously (11Sugaya T. Nishimatsu S. Tanimoto K. Takimoto E. Yamagishi T. Imamura K. Goto S. Imaizumi K. Hisada Y. Otsuka A. Uchida H. Sugiura M. Fukuta K. Fukamizu A. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18719-18722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Under the attenuated conditions to the vasopressor actions on the AT1a-deficient background, the base-line blood pressure of double mutant mice homozygous for both APJ and AT1a was elevated significantly compared with that of AT1a-deficient mice (81.6 ± 4.0 and 75.8 ± 2.3 mm Hg, respectively; p < 0.05). These data indicated that APJ has a potential ability to lower the blood pressure. Previously, it was demonstrated that AT2-deficient mice exhibited the increase in sensitivity to low dose angiotensin II-induced vasopressor action (26Hein L. Barsh G.S. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Kobilka B.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 27Ichiki T. Labosky P.A. Shiota C. Okuyama S. Imagawa Y. Fogo A. Niimura F. Ichikawa I. Hogan B.L. Inagami T. Nature. 1995; 377: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Likewise, APJ may function as a member of the vasorelaxation system in blood pressure regulation against the vasoconstriction system including angiotensin II-induced AT1 signaling. In conclusion, the inactivation of the APJ gene in mice by gene targeting indicated that this receptor is responsible for the hypotensive effect of apelin in adult mice in vivo and plays a counterregulatory role against vasopressor stimulation. In addition, by using primary endothelial cells derived from mice, it is suggested that the hypotensive effect induced by apelin-APJ signaling is mediated through the NO/l-arginine system activated by eNOS phosphorylation. In the future, beside the systemic effects of apelin-APJ signaling, the selective functions of APJ in the local tissues including the central nervous and cardiovascular systems should be elucidated. This animal model may be useful for investigating the in vivo role of apelin-APJ signaling in normal and pathophysiological conditions and for testing pharmacotherapeutic implications for the cardiovascular diseases. We thank Dr. Shin-ichiro Nishimatsu and the Fukamizu laboratory members for helpful discussion and encouragement."

We studied the interaction of magnetic, stellar, and twilight orientation cues in free-flying songbirds. We exposed Catharus thrushes to eastward-turned magnetic fields during the twilight period before takeoff and then followed them for up to 1100 kilometers. Instead of heading north, experimental birds flew westward. On subsequent nights, the same individuals migrated northward again. We suggest that birds orient with a magnetic compass calibrated daily from twilight cues. This could explain how birds cross the magnetic equator and deal with declination."

https://openalex.org/W2078074803,"ApoAV has been discovered recently as a novel modifier of triglyceride (TG) metabolism, but the pathways involved are currently unknown. To gain insight into the function of apoAV, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of murine apoa5 to C57Bl/6 mice was employed. The injection of low doses of Ad-apoa5 (1–5 × 108 plaqueforming units/mouse) dose-dependently reduced plasma very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG levels. First, we evaluated whether a reduced hepatic VLDL production contributed to the TG-lowering effect. Ad-apoa5 treatment dose-dependently diminished (29–37%) the VLDL-TG production rate without affecting VLDL particle production, suggesting that apoAV impairs the lipidation of apoB. Second, Ad-apoa5 treatment dose-dependently reduced (68–88%) the postprandial hypertriglyceridemia following an intragastric fat load, suggesting that apoAV also stimulates the lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-dependent clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins. Indeed, recombinant apoAV was found to dose-dependently stimulate LPL activity up to 2.3-fold in vitro. Accordingly, intravenously injected VLDL-like TG-rich emulsions were cleared at an accelerated rate concomitant with the increased uptake of emulsion TG-derived fatty acids by skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue in Ad-apoa5-treated mice. From these data, we conclude that apoAV is a potent stimulator of LPL activity. Thus, apoAV lowers plasma TG by both reducing the hepatic VLDL-TG production rate and by enhancing the lipolytic conversion of TG-rich lipoproteins.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor for coronary heart disease independent from the well known risk factors such as elevated LDL 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; pfu, plaque-forming unit; PL, phospholipid(s); TC, total cholesterol; TG, triglyceride(s); VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. and reduced HDL cholesterol levels (1Cullen P. Am. J. Cardiol. 2000; 86: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel apolipoprotein, apoAV, has been identified that strongly influences plasma triglyceride (TG) levels (2Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.C.

The human APOA5 gene is part of the apolipoprotein gene cluster on chromosome 11q23 that also encompasses APOA1, APOC3, and APOA4. An initial study revealed the association of three single nucleotide polymorphisms within the APOA5 locus with plasma TG levels and VLDL mass in humans (2Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.C. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Science. 2001; 294: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Importantly, these metabolic effects were not associated with a genetic marker in the nearby APOC3 gene that is also known to affect plasma TG levels (2Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.C. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Science. 2001; 294: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies in diverse ethnic groups uncovered additional single nucleotide polymorphisms including apoAV protein variants and further supported a role for common genetic variations in APOA5 in influencing plasma TG levels (4Kao J.T.

Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3031-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in a recent study, minor allele frequencies of 3 of 5 studied single nucleotide polymorphisms were found to be significantly higher in a hypertriglyceridemic population (4Kao J.T. Wen H.C. Chien K.L. Hsu H.C. Lin S.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2533-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Mouse models confirmed the TG-modulating effects of apoAV observed in humans. Mice expressing a human APOA5 transgene showed a 65% decrease in plasma TG levels compared with control mice (2Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.C. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Science. 2001; 294: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Conversely, apoa5 knock-out mice showed a 400% increase in plasma TG concentration (2Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.C. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Science. 2001; 294: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the adenovirus-mediated expression of apoAV in mice resulted in a decrease of both plasma TG and total cholesterol (TC) of 70 and 40%, respectively (6van der Vliet H.N. Schaap F.G. Levels J.H. Ottenhoff R. Looije N. Wesseling J.G. Groen A.K. Chamuleau R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 1156-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). ApoAV appears to be expressed exclusively in the liver. At present, it is unknown in what form apoAV is secreted by the liver. The circulating mature form has a predicted molecular mass of 39 kDa and is associated mainly with HDL and to a lesser extent with VLDL particles (3van der Vliet H.N. Sammels M.G. Leegwater A.C. Levels J.H. Reitsma P.H. Boers W. Chamuleau R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44512-44520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This distribution is somewhat puzzling as apoAV mainly seems to affect VLDL metabolism. Initially, apoAV may be secreted along with VLDL, and as lipolytic conversion of VLDL progresses and excess surface lipids are being transferred to HDL, apoAV may end up in HDL in a similar way. Structure predictions indicate that apoAV is a very hydrophobic, highly α-helical protein (7Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Beckstead J.A. Martin D.D. Gallagher J.W. Shelness G.S. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34438-34444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). At the protein level, apoAV appears most homologous (20–28% amino acid identity) with exchangeable apolipoproteins apoAI, apoAIV, and apoE, prompting the study of lipid efflux and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activation properties of apoAV (8Beckstead J.A. Oda M.N. Martin D.D. Forte T.M. Bielicki J.K. Berger T. Luty R. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9416-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, no such activity could be demonstrated in in vitro experiments employing recombinant apoAV (8Beckstead J.A. Oda M.N. Martin D.D. Forte T.M. Bielicki J.K. Berger T. Luty R. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9416-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Little is known regarding the regulation of apoAV levels, but peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and the farnesoid X receptor have been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of the APOA5 gene (9Vu-Dac N. Gervois P. Jakel H. Nowak M. Bauge E. Dehondt H. Staels B. Pennacchio L.A. Rubin E.M. Fruchart-Najib J. Fruchart J.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25468-25480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Animal studies and genetic association studies clearly indicate a strong effect of apoAV on plasma TG levels, implicating a role for apoAV in VLDL metabolism. Based on structural analysis, it has been proposed that, at the intracellular level, apoAV may affect hepatic VLDL production (7Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Beckstead J.A. Martin D.D. Gallagher J.W. Shelness G.S. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34438-34444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Alternatively, apoAV may stimulate lipolytic conversion of TG-rich lipoproteins. To address the mechanism(s) underlying the hypotriglyceridemic action of apoAV, we employed the adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of murine apoa5 to C57Bl/6 mice. Our results show that the expression of apoAV in mice reduces plasma TG and TC levels. ApoAV dose-dependently inhibited the hepatic VLDL-TG production rate without affecting the VLDL-apoB production rate. Moreover, our present studies clearly demonstrate that apoAV accelerates the rate of LPL-mediated TG hydrolysis both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we propose that apoAV has a dual effect on VLDL metabolism, diminishing hepatic apoB lipidation and increasing the efficiency of TG disposal from circulating lipoproteins. Interestingly, this hypotriglyceridemic effect of apoAV is associated with a decrease of plasma TC levels. These observations suggest that apoAV is an interesting target in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.

Triolein was obtained from Fluka. Hypnorm was from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, and midazolam was from Roche Applied Science. l-α-Lysophosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, cholesteryl oleate, purified bovine milk LPL, essentially free fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, Triton WR1339 (tyloxapol), and diethyl-p-nitrophenylphosphate (paraoxon) were from Sigma. Purified human apoCII and apoCIII were from Labconsult. Olive oil was from Carbonell. Heparin was from Leo Pharmaceutical Products. Solvable™ was from Packard Bioscience. All of the other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from various suppliers. For the determination of lipids, commercially available kits (TG and TC (Sigma) and phospholipids (PL) (Wako Chemicals)) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Animals—13–17-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice were taken from the breeding colony at the University of Leiden. Mice were kept in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment and had free access to standard laboratory chow and water. All of the animals used in the experiments received humane care, and all of the experiments were approved by the animal ethics committees from the University of Leiden and TNO-Prevention and Health. Adenoviral Expression of ApoAV in C57Bl/6 Mice—The construction of a recombinant replication-deficient adenoviral vector expressing mouse apoAV (Ad-apoa5) has been described previously (6van der Vliet H.N. Schaap F.G. Levels J.H. Ottenhoff R. Looije N. Wesseling J.G. Groen A.K. Chamuleau R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 1156-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). 0–5 × 108 pfu of Ad-apoa5 (total viral dose adjusted to 5 × 108 with empty vector (Ad-mock)) were injected into the tail vein of the mice (n = 4 – 6/group) at 3 h after the injection of Ad-LacZ (5 × 108 pfu) to saturate the uptake of viral particles by Kupffer cells (11Tao N. Gao G.P. Parr M. Johnston J. Baradet T. Wilson J.M. Barsoum J. Fawell S.E. Mol. Ther. 2001; 3: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Prior to injection and 4 days after injection, mice were fasted for 4 h and a blood sample for lipid determination was collected in paraoxon-coated capillaries by tail bleeding. Mice were bled by retroorbital bleeding, and serum was prepared. For each group, sera were pooled and lipoproteins were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography (Superose 6). Following exsanguination, livers were excised, rinsed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For determination of hepatic gene expression, mRNA was isolated from liver samples and converted to cDNA. The expression levels of apoa5 were determined relative to cyclophilin A by real-time PCR (Taqman). Western blot analysis of serum samples was used to estimate the extent of apoAV expression as described previously (6van der Vliet H.N. Schaap F.G. Levels J.H. Ottenhoff R. Looije N. Wesseling J.G. Groen A.K. Chamuleau R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 1156-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Hepatic VLDL-Triglyceride Production—To determine the effect of apoAV expression on the hepatic VLDL-TG production rate, mice were injected via the tail vein with 5 × 108 pfu of Ad-apoa5 or Ad-LacZ (n = 5/group). After 4 days, a 4-h fasted blood sample was taken (t = 0). Mice were anesthetized with Hypnorm (0.1 mg/kg fentanyl citrate and 25 mg/kg fluanisone) and midazolam (12.5 mg/kg) and injected via the tail vein with Trans35S label (150 μCi/mouse). After 30 min, 12.5 mg of Triton WR1339 (10% solution in saline) was injected to block lipolysis (12Otway S. Robinson D.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1967; 190: 321-332Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Subsequent blood samples were drawn at 10, 30, 60, and 90 min after injection via tail bleeding. At t = 120 min, mice were exsanguinated and the VLDL fraction of each mouse was isolated quantitatively from 400 μl of serum after density gradient ultracentrifugation (13Redgrave T.G. Roberts D.C. West C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 65: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). VLDL-TG was measured as described above. VLDL-apoB was precipitated selectively by 2-propanol (14Yamada N. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 910-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and counted for the incorporated 35S. Preparation of Recombinant ApoAV—Rat apoAV protein was produced by transformed Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells as described previously (3van der Vliet H.N. Sammels M.G. Leegwater A.C. Levels J.H. Reitsma P.H. Boers W. Chamuleau R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44512-44520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged apoAV protein was purified from guanidinium hydrochloride-solubilized inclusion bodies by metal affinity chromatography (AP Biotech) using an fast protein liquid chromatography system. Renaturation was achieved by on-column refolding of the protein in a linear 6–0 m urea gradient. Elution was performed with a linear 20–500 mm imidazole gradient in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. ApoAV-containing fractions were pooled, and buffer was exchanged to phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Finally, preparations were filter-sterilized (0.22 μm) and stored at –20 °C. The presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 proved to be essential to prevent the precipitation of apoAV during column elution and subsequent storage. Recombinant apoAV was essentially pure as judged from SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid method. Preparation of VLDL-like Emulsions—VLDL-like TG-rich emulsion particles were prepared as described previously (15Rensen P.C. van Dijk M.C. Havenaar E.C. Bijsterbosch M.K. Kruijt J.K. van Berkel T.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Hereto, 100 mg of total lipid at a weight ratio of triolein:egg yolk phosphatidylcholine: lysophosphatidylcholine:cholesterYl oleate:cholesterol (70:22.7:2.3:3.0: 2.0) supplemented with 50–200 μCi of [3H]triolein was sonicated using a Soniprep 150 (MSE Scientific Instruments) at an output of 10 μm. An emulsion fraction containing 80-nm sized emulsion particles was obtained by consecutive density gradient ultracentrifugation steps exactly as described previously (16Rensen P.C. Herijgers N. Netscher M.H. Meskers S.C. van Eck M. van Berkel T.J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1070-1084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TG content of emulsions was determined as described above. In Vitro LPL Activity Assay—The effect of apolipoproteins on LPL activity was determined essentially as described (17Rensen P.C. van Berkel T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14791-14799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). First, [3H]triolein-labeled emulsion particles (200 μg of TG) were incubated (30 min at 37 °C) with the indicated amounts of human apoCII, human apoCIII, and/or rat apoAV in 75 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequently, 0.1 m Tris·HCl pH 8.5 was added to a total volume of 200 μl. At t = 0, LPL (final concentration 3.5 units/ml) was added in 200 μl of 12% bovine serum albumin (as [3H]oleate acceptor). At t = 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min, [9,10-3H]oleate that was generated during lipolysis was extracted. Hereto, 50-μl samples were added to 1.5 ml of CH3OH:CHCl3: heptane:oleic acid (1410:1250:1000:1 (v/v/v/v)) and to 0.5 ml of 0.2 m NaOH. Following vigorous mixing and centrifugation (10 min at 1000 × g), 3H radioactivity in 0.5 ml of the aqueous phase was counted in 5 ml of Ultima Gold (Packard Bioscience). The recovery of [3H]oleate in the aqueous phase following organic extraction was corrected for a 78.0 ± 0.9% recovery of [1-14C]oleate internal standard. Lipolysis rates were calculated by linear regression (regression coefficients were typically greater than 0.995) and expressed as nanomole oleate released per milliliter per min. The inclusion of 1 m NaCl during incubations resulted in negligible lipolytic activity, indicating that the employed LPL preparation was not contaminated with salt-insensitive hepatic lipase. Postprandial TG Response—To determine the effect of apoAV expression on the postprandial TG response, mice were injected via the tail vein with 1–5 × 108 pfu of Ad-apoa5 or Ad-mock (n = 5–6/group) as described above. After 5 days, the 4-h fasted blood samples were drawn and the mice received an intragastric load of 200 μl of olive oil. Additional blood samples were drawn after 1, 2, 4, and 6 h, and the resulting sera were assayed for TG as described above. Clearance of VLDL-like Emulsions in Vivo—To determine the effect of apoAV expression on the kinetics of TG-rich emulsions in vivo, mice were injected via the tail vein with 1 × 109 pfu of Ad-apoa5 or Ad-mock (n = 4/group). At 5 days after adenoviral injection, serum clearance and tissue distribution of VLDL-like emulsion particles was studied as detailed elsewhere (16Rensen P.C. Herijgers N. Netscher M.H. Meskers S.C. van Eck M. van Berkel T.J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1070-1084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fed mice were anesthetized as described above, and their abdomens were opened. 200 μl of VLDL-like [3H]triolein-labeled emulsion particles was administered via the vena cava inferior at a dose (1.0 mg of TG) that exceeded the endogenous plasma TG content in both experimental groups. Venous blood was sampled at 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 min following injection, and the respective sera were assayed for 3H radioactivity. After the last sampling, gonadal, perirenal, and intestinal white adipose tissue, heart, hind limb muscle tissue, liver, and spleen were harvested and solubilized in Solvable (overnight at 60 °C) and 3H radioactivity was determined. Statistical Analysis—The Mann-Whitney nonparametric test for two independent samples was used to define differences between the experimental groups. The criterion for significance was set at p < 0.05. Plasma Lipid and Lipoprotein Levels after Adenovirus-mediated Gene Transfer of apoa5 to C57Bl/6 Mice—The injection of low doses of Ad-apoa5 (1, 2.5, and 5 × 108 pfu) dose-dependently reduced plasma TG, TC, and PL (Fig. 1). At the highest dose, plasma TG was lowered to the same extent (–65%) as in mice transgenic for the human APOA5 gene (2Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.C. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Science. 2001; 294: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). In contrast with these transgenic animals, which are normocholesterolemic, we found consistent (6van der Vliet H.N. Schaap F.G. Levels J.H. Ottenhoff R. Looije N. Wesseling J.G. Groen A.K. Chamuleau R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 1156-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) lowering of plasma TC with 68% at the highest viral dose. However, moderate overexpression by injection of 1 × 108 pfu of Ad-apoa5 reduced only plasma TG levels significantly (–33%, p < 0.01 versus control virus), whereas plasma TC and PL were unaffected. Compared with mice receiving control virus, the mice that were injected with 1, 2.5, and 5 × 108 pfu of Ad-apoa5 had ∼10-, 20-, and 30-fold higher hepatic apoa5 mRNA levels, respectively, at day 4 post-injection (data not shown). When compared with preinjection values, apoAV protein levels in plasma were elevated ∼10-, 20-, and 35-fold at day 4 after the injection of 1, 2.5, and 5 × 108 pfu of Ad-apoa5, respectively (data not shown). An analysis of lipoprotein fractions separated by fast protein liquid chromatography revealed that apoAV-mediated reduction of plasma TG was mainly confined to the VLDL fraction resulting in the virtual absence of VLDL-TG at the highest viral dose (Fig. 2, left panel). Both the TG content of the intermediate density lipoprotein/LDL fraction and size of the intermediate density lipoprotein/LDL-TG peak fraction decreased in an Ad-apoa5 dose-dependent manner. In addition, Ad-apoa5 treatment reduced HDL-TG. The TC-reducing effects of apoAV overexpression were attributed mainly to the reduction of HDL, which is the main carrier of cholesterol in normolipidemic mice (Fig. 2, right panel). Hepatic VLDL Production after Adenovirus-mediated Gene Transfer of apoa5 to C57Bl/6 Mice—To evaluate whether reduced VLDL production contributed to the TG-lowering effect of apoAV, the hepatic VLDL production rate was assessed using Triton WR1339 to block lipolysis and the clearance of VLDL. As compared with control virus, the injection of 1 × 108 or 5 × 108 pfu of Ad-apoa5 dose-dependently reduced the VLDL-TG secretion rate with 29–37% (5.08 ± 0.54, 3.63 ± 0.20, and 3.22 ± 0.68 mm/h, respectively; p < 0.01) without affecting the VLDL-[35S]apoB production rate (Fig. 3, left and right panels). Apparently, apoAV inhibits the intrahepatic lipidation of apoB without affecting VLDL particle production. An analysis of VLDL isolated 2 h after Triton WR1339 injection indicated significant reductions of VLDL lipid content. The highest Ad-apoa5 dose (5 × 108 pfu) mainly affected VLDL-TG (–39%; 6.37 ± 1.39 versus 10.4 ± 1.43 mm; mean ± S.D. (Fig. 3, middle panel)), although TC (–24%; 1.10 ± 0.15 versus 1.45 ± 0.25 mm) and PL (–32%; 1.21 ± 0.25 versus 1.79 ± 0.29 mm)) also was reduced (p < 0.05 versus Ad-LacZ)). An analysis of the lipid composition of VLDL obtained from mice injected with the lowest dose of Ad-apoa5 (1 × 108 pfu) revealed a significant reduction of the TG content (–26%; 7.74 ± 0.16 versus 10.4 ± 1.43 mm), whereas the TC and PL content only tended to be lower (data not shown). The predominant effect of Ad-apoa5 on VLDL-TG levels is indicative of reduction of VLDL particle size. Postprandial TG Response after Adenovirus-mediated Gene Transfer of apoa5 to C57Bl/6 Mice—In addition to reducing the rate of hepatic VLDL-TG secretion, we questioned whether apoAV could also enhance the lipolytic conversion of TG-rich lipoproteins. First, we studied whether apoAV affected post-prandial lipemia, anticipating enhanced catabolism of TG-rich lipoproteins if apoAV would stimulate LPL activity. For this purpose, mice were injected with adenovirus and were given an intragastric gavage of olive oil after 5 days to force rapid and extensive chylomicron production. Animals injected with Ad-apoa5 showed a dose-dependent lowering of the postprandial TG response (68, 73, and 88% reduction compared with control virus at Ad-apoa5 doses of 1 × 108, 2.5 × 108, and 5 × 108 pfu, respectively) (Fig. 4). These findings indicate that apoAV overexpression results in a rapid clearance of chylomicron-TG. Because apoAV is not expressed by the intestine, a direct effect of apoAV on intestinal lipid absorption is unlikely. Thus, these findings strongly suggest that the diminished postprandial TG response is the result of a stimulating effect of apoAV on LPL-mediated lipolysis. Effect of Purified apoAV on LPL-mediated TG Hydrolysis in Vitro—To directly evaluate the effect of recombinant rat apoAV on the triacylglycerol hydrolase activity of LPL, we determined the effect of purified apoAV on LPL-mediated TG hydrolysis from [3H]triolein-labeled VLDL-like emulsions in vitro. The incubation of 80-nm sized VLDL-like protein-free emulsion particles with LPL in the presence of apoCII resulted in an apoCII dose-dependent increased rate of [3H]oleate generation from emulsion-incorporated glycerol-tri[3H]oleate (Fig. 5A) obeying initial linear kinetics up to 120 min. Preincubation of particles with 0.48 nmol of apoAV enhanced the apoCII-stimulated lipolysis rate ∼2-fold (Fig. 5, A and B). In the presence of apoCII, apoAV dose-dependently stimulated LPL activity up to 2.3-fold at the highest dose but it was ineffective in the absence of apoCII (Fig. 5B). Preincubation of particles with the well established LPL-inhibitor apoCIII in the presence of a small amount of cofactor (0.11 nmol of apoCII) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the lipolysis rate, reaching 65% inhibition at the highest dose (Fig. 5, C and D). Importantly, the LPL-inhibitory effect of apoCIII could be overcome fully by a low concentration of apoAV (apoAV:apoCIII = 1:20, mol/mol) (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data suggest that apoAV may act as a stimulatory modifier of apoCII-induced LPL-mediated TG hydrolysis. Kinetics of VLDL-like Emulsion Clearance after Adenovirus-mediated Gene Transfer of apoa5 to C57Bl/6 Mice—To further evaluate the metabolic consequences of the LPL-activating properties of apoAV in vivo, we subsequently determined the tissue distribution of [3H]oleate derived from intravenously injected [3H]triolein-labeled VLDL-like emulsion particles. In line with the concept that apoAV stimulates LPL activity, the serum clearance of emulsion-TG was much faster in Ad-apoa5-treated mice compared with mice injected with control virus (t½ = 2.2 ± 0.2 versus 7.6 ± 0.2 min, respectively; p < 0.05) (Fig. 6, left panel). The accelerated TG clearance in Ad-apoa5-treated animals was accompanied by a 2.5–3.5-fold increased uptake of 3H radioactivity by gonadal, perirenal, and intestinal white adipose tissue (p < 0.05), a 1.8-fold increased uptake by hind limb muscle tissue (p < 0.05), and a trend toward an increased uptake by the heart (Fig. 6, right panel). The uptake by the liver also was increased (57%, p < 0.05). In contrast, the uptake by the spleen, which mainly reflects whole particle uptake because the spleen does not express LPL activity, was unaffected. Collectively, these data indicate the potency of the stimulatory effect of apoAV on LPL-mediated TG-rich lipoprotein clearance in vivo. In this study, we have demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of murine apoa5 results in a dose-dependent reduction of plasma TG in mice (Fig. 1). At least two mechanisms underlie the hypotriglyceridemic effect of apoAV overexpression. First, apoAV diminishes the rate of hepatic VLDL-TG secretion. Second, apoAV increases the efficiency of LPL-mediated TG hydrolysis. We propose that the latter mechanism results in increased conversion of VLDL and chylomicrons in their respective remnants and a subsequently more efficient clearance of remnants by the liver. Based on structural analysis, it has been proposed recently (7Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Beckstead J.A. Martin D.D. Gallagher J.W. Shelness G.S. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34438-34444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) that apoAV functions in VLDL metabolism by inhibiting hepatic VLDL secretion. In this study, we have provided experimental proof for such a function (Fig. 3). One could argue that the adenoviral overexpression of a secreted apolipoprotein overloads the capacity of the ER/Golgi secretory pathway and thereby interferes with apoB lipid acquisition. Studies with other adenovirally overexpressed apolipoproteins oppose this view. We have reported previously that the adenoviral overexpression of apoE strongly increases the VLDL-TG secretion rate compared with either Ad-GFP (18Kypreos K.E. Willems van Dijk K. van der Zee A.

https://openalex.org/W1995946312,"Calmodulin (CaM) interactions with Ca2+ channels mediate both Ca2+ regulation of channels and local Ca2+ triggering of transcription factors implicated in neuronal memory. Crucial to these functions are the number of CaM molecules (CaMs) regulating each channel, and the number of CaMs privy to the local Ca2+ signal from each channel. To resolve these parameters, we fused L-type Ca2+ channels to single CaM molecules. These chimeric molecules revealed that a single CaM directs L-type channel regulation. Similar fusion molecules were used to estimate the local CaM concentration near Ca2+ channels. This estimate indicates marked enrichment of local CaM, as if a ""school"" of nearby CaMs were poised to enhance the transduction of local Ca2+ entry into diverse signaling pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2123570806,"In yeast, mitochondrial fusion requires Ugo1p and two GTPases, Fzo1p and Mgm1p. Ugo1p is anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane with its N terminus facing the cytosol and C terminus in the intermembrane space. Fzo1p is also an outer membrane protein, whereas Mgm1p is located in the intermembrane space. Recent studies suggest that these three proteins form protein complexes that mediate mitochondrial fusion. Here, we show that the cytoplasmic domain of Ugo1p directly interacts with Fzo1p, whereas its intermembrane space domain binds to Mgm1p. We identified the Ugo1p-binding site in Fzo1p and demonstrated that Ugo1p-Fzo1p interaction is essential for the formation of mitochondrial shape, maintenance of mitochondrial DNA, and fusion of mitochondria. Although the GTPase domains of Fzo1p and Mgm1p regulate mitochondrial fusion, they were not required for association with Ugo1p. Furthermore, we found that Ugo1p bridges the interaction between Fzo1p and Mgm1p in mitochondria. Our data indicate that distinct regions of Ugo1p bind directly to Fzo1p and Mgm1p and thereby link these two GTPases during mitochondrial fusion.

Cells lacking any of these proteins contain many small mitochondrial fragments rather than the few branched mitochondrial tubules seen in wild-type cells.

In addition to fusion, Fzo1p, Ugo1p, and Mgm1p are also important to maintain mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). 1The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; IMS, intermembrane space; MBP, maltose-binding protein; OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. fzo1, ugo1, and mgm1 mutants lose mtDNA and are therefore defective in respiration. The fragmentation of mitochondria in fzo1, ugo1, and mgm1 mutants is a consequence of ongoing mitochondrial division in the absence of fusion. Mitochondrial division is mediated by Dnm1p (13Sesaki H. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), Gag3p/Mdv1p/Net2p (14Tieu Q. Nunnari J. J.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Similar to mitochondrial fragmentation, the loss of mtDNA in fzo1, ugo1, and mgm 1 mutants depends on mitochondrial division. Fzo1p is a GTPase identified as a homolog of Drosophila fuzzy onions, which is required for mitochondrial fusion during fly spermatogenesis (8Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G.

Fzo1p is located in the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) and contains two cytoplasmic domains (Fritz et al. (28Fritz S. Rapaport D. Klanner E. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar); see Fig. 1A). The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain carries the GTPase domain, which is essential for mitochondrial fusion (8Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), whereas the role of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain is unknown. Mgm1p is a dynamin-related GTPase located in the intermembrane space (IMS) (11Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Scott S.V. Okreglak V. Holewinske T.J. Cassidy-Stone A. Nunnari J. J.

There are two species of Mgm1p, a 90- and a 100-kDa form; the smaller form is produced by cleavage of the larger form by the rhomboid-like serine protease, Pcp1p/Rbd1p/Ugo2p (22Herlan M. Vogel F.

Although the exact functions of these two forms in mitochondrial dynamics are not clear, the 100-kDa form appears to be more important for mitochondrial fusion than the 90-kDa form. Cells that lack the protease express only the 100-kDa form and contain partially fragmented mitochondria but remain competent for mitochondrial fusion (22Herlan M. Vogel F. Bornhovd C. Neupert W.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Ugo1p is a 58-kDa protein anchored in the OM by a single transmembrane domain (see Fig. 1A). An ∼33-kDa N-terminal domain faces the cytosol, whereas an ∼23-kDa C-terminal domain is exposed to the IMS. Recent studies have shown that Ugo1p, Fzo1p, and Mgm1p coimmunoprecipitate from detergent-solubilized mitochondria (12Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2342-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and can be chemically cross-linked in intact mitochondria (11Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Scott S.V. Okreglak V. Holewinske T.J. Cassidy-Stone A. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), suggesting that these proteins either coassemble or interact with each other in pairs. In this paper, we examine the role of Ugo1p-mediated protein-protein interactions in mitochondrial fusion. Our data suggest that distinct domains of Ugo1p directly and functionally interact with both Fzo1p and Mgm1p to link these two GTPases during mitochondrial fusion. Media and Genetic Methods—Yeast cells were grown in media including YEPD (yeast extract peptone medium containing 2% dextrose), YEPGE (yeast extract peptone medium containing 2% glycerol and 2% ethanol), SRaf (synthetic medium containing 2% raffinose), and SGal-Suc (synthetic medium containing 2% galactose and 2% sucrose). Standard genetic techniques were used (25Adams A. Gottschling D. Kaiser C. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1997: 145-157Google Scholar). Strains—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. fzo1Δ ugo1Δ dnm1Δ cells (YRJ1665) were obtained by crossing dnm1Δ fzo1Δ cells (YRJ1347) to ugo1Δ cells (YRJ1277). mgm1Δ ugo1Δ dnm1Δ cells (YRJ1609) were obtained by crossing dnm1Δ ugo1Δ cells (YRJ1292) to mgm1Δ cells (YRJ1383). To create FZO1 (YRJ1811 and -1812) and fzo1-825 cells (YRJ1813 and -1814), pRS304-FZO1 and pRS304-fzo1-825 were digested with NsiI and transformed into MATa and MATα fzo1Δ cells (YRJ1810 and -1811) carrying pRS416-FZO1. Integration of these plasmids into chromosomes was confirmed by PCR. We selected cells that lost pRS416-FZO1 on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (26Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen.

Radiolabeled protein (5 μl) was incubated with 6 μg of MBP fusion protein attached to amylose beads (55 μl of 50% slurry) in 450 μl of binding buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were washed three times in wash buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation from detergent-solubilized mitochondria was performed as described previously (12Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2342-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The mitochondria were solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer (2% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma) at 4 °C for 10 min. Mitochondrial Fusion Assay—Mitochondrial fusion during mating was observed as described previously (12Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2342-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 24Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Hobbs A.E. Jensen R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Fzo1p and Mgm1p Directly Interact with Distinct Domains of Ugo1p—Ugo1p coimmunoprecipitates from detergent-solubilized mitochondria with Fzo1p (the OM-localized GTPase) and Mgm1p (the IMS-localized GTPase) (12Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2342-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To test whether Ugo1p directly interacts with these two GTPases, we performed an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins. MBP and MBP fused to the cytoplasmic domain of Ugo1p (residues 1–294; MBP-cyto Ugo1p) or the IMS domain (residues 312–503; MBP-IMS Ugo1p) were expressed and purified from E. coli (Fig. 1B). Full-length 35S-labeled Fzo1p was synthesized in reticulocyte lysate and incubated with MBP fusion proteins. The MBP fusions were collected on amylose-coupled beads, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1C, ∼10% of Fzo1p was found in the pellet fraction along with MBP-cyto Ugo1p but not with MBP-IMS Ugo1p or MBP alone. As a further control, we used 35S-labeled Mmm1p, an OM protein that is not involved in mitochondrial fusion (12Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2342-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and found that Mmm1p did not interact with any MBP fusion. When 35S-labeled Mgm1p was incubated with MBP-IMS Ugo1p and MBP, Mgm1p specifically precipitated with MBP-IMS Ugo1p but not with MBP (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of Ugo1p binds directly to Fzo1p, whereas the IMS domain of Ugo1p directly interacts with Mgm1p. Identification of the Ugo1p-binding Site in Fzo1p—To map the Ugo1p-binding domain in Fzo1p, different regions of Fzo1p were synthesized and incubated with MBP-cyto Ugo1p. Because Fzo1p has two cytoplasmic domains (28Fritz S. Rapaport D. Klanner E. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we first asked if individual cytoplasmic domains (Fzo11–703p and Fzo1755–855p) bind to MBP-cyto Ugo1p and found that neither of them precipitated with MBP-cyto Ugo1p (Fig. 1E). Then we made a series of Fzo1p truncations from either its N or C terminus. MBP-cyto Ugo1p bound to Fzo1p fragments lacking the first 449 residues (Fzo1450–855p) and 629 residues (Fzo1630–855p) but did not bind to a shorter fragment (Fzo1671–855p). Therefore, a small part of the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Fzo1p is required for its interaction with MBP-cyto Ugo1p. Similarly, the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Fzo1p was also essential for the interaction. Fzo1p fragments lacking 12 residues from the C terminus (Fzo11–843p) bound to MBP-cyto Ugo1p, but further truncations (Fzo11–825p) completely inhibited the interaction. These results indicate that both cytoplasmic domains of Fzo1p are necessary for interaction with Ugo1p and that the Ugo1p-binding domain in Fzo1p is located between amino acid residues 630–843. Because the transmembrane domains of Fzo1p span residues 704–726 and 737–755 (28Fritz S. Rapaport D. Klanner E. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), it is likely that the minimal binding domain consists of 74 residues (630–703) in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and 90 residues (756–843) in the C-terminal domain. Our data also show that the GTPase domain of Fzo1p is not required for interaction with Ugo1p in vitro, because Fzo1p fragments lacking the GTPase domain (Fzo1450–855p and Fzo1630–855p) were competent for binding. Furthermore, when we coimmunoprecipitated Ugo1p and Fzo1p from detergent-solubilized mitochondria, a mutation in the GTPase domain (K200A), which blocks the function of Fzo1p (8Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), did not affect the Ugo1p-Fzo1p interaction (data not shown). Therefore, Fzo1p interacts with Ugo1p independently of its GTPase domain both in vitro and in vivo. However, the GTPase domain of Fzo1p might modulate the interaction between Fzo1p and Ugo1p. We found that a Fzo1p fragment lacking the GTPase domain (Fzo1450–855p) binds to MBP-cyto Ugo1p more efficiently than full-length Fzo1p (Fig. 1F). Specifically, more than 50% of Fzo1450–855p coprecipitated with MBP-cyto Ugo1p. In contrast, all other fragments examined here bound to Ugo1p similar to full-length Fzo1p, with ∼10% of each coprecipitating with Ugo1p. These data suggest that the GTPase domain of Fzo1p partially inhibits the Fzo1p-Ugo1p interaction. Because further truncations of Fzo1450–855p reduced its strong binding activity (compare Fzo1450–855p with Fzo1630–855p), it is likely that residues 450–630 are not essential for the Fzo1p-Ugo1p interaction but make the interaction stronger. We speculate that the GTPase domain of Fzo1p regulates the Fzo1p-Ugo1p interaction by masking and exposing these residues (450–630) during GTP binding and hydrolysis. Fzo1–825p Is Compromised for Ugo1p Binding—To determine whether amino acid residues 630–843 in Fzo1p serve as a Ugo1p-binding domain in vivo, we expressed a mutant version of Fzo1p that lacks part of this sequence in yeast cells. We used Fzo1-825p, in which the last 30 residues are deleted, because these residues are dispensable for both the import of Fzo1p into the mitochondria and insertion into the OM with the correct topology (28Fritz S. Rapaport D. Klanner E. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For detection, Fzo1p was tagged with the HA epitope at the N terminus. The mitochondria were isolated from the fzo1Δ cells expressing HA-Fzo1p or HA-Fzo1-825p and analyzed by immunoblotting. As expected, HA-Fzo1-825p migrated slightly faster on the gels than wild-type HA-Fzo1p. We found similar amounts of HA-Fzo1p and HA-Fzo1-825p in the mitochondria (Fig. 2A). Thus, HA-Fzo1-825p is normally expressed and localized in mitochondria. To perform coimmunoprecipitation between Ugo1p and Fzo1p, we expressed Myc-Ugo1p plus either HA-Fzo1p or HA-Fzo1-825p in ugo1Δ fzo1Δ dnm1Δ cells. We disrupted DNM1 because cells expressing Fzo1-825p as the sole copy of Fzo1p lose mtDNA (see Fig. 3). dnm1Δ cells are defective in mitochondrial division and can therefore maintain mtDNA even in the absence of a functional copy of Fzo1p (13Sesaki H. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Deletion of DNM1 did not affect interactions between Ugo1p and Fzo1p. When we carried out coimmunoprecipitation using mitochondria isolated from wild-type cells lacking mtDNA, we found equivalent interaction between HA-Fzo1p and Myc-Ugo1p (data not shown). The mitochondria were isolated and solubilized by Triton X-100. We then immunoprecipitated Myc-Ugo1p using anti-Myc antibodies and analyzed the pellet fraction by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2B, almost all of the Myc-Ugo1p was found in the pellet fractions. When we examined the pellet with anti-HA antibodies, a fraction of HA-Fzo1p (∼6%) reproducibly coprecipitated with Myc-Ugo1p, confirming our previous observations (12Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2342-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In contrast, HA-Fzo1-825p showed dramatically reduced interaction with Myc-Ugo1p, and ∼7-fold less HA-Fzo1-825p was found in the pellet compared with HA-Fzo1p. Importantly, we noted that similar amounts of Mgm1p coprecipitated with Myc-Ugo1p from mitochondrial extracts containing either HA-Fzo1p or HA-Fzo1-825p, suggesting that interactions between Mgm1p and Ugo1p are independent of the Ugo1p-Fzo1p interaction. The 100-kDa form of Mgm1p (Fig. 2B, arrow) more efficiently precipitated with Myc-Ugo1p than the 90-kDa form, as reported previously (12Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2342-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). An abundant OM protein, OM45, did not coprecipitate with Myc-Ugo1p. As a further control, we used beads without antibodies, and found no Myc-Ugo1p, HA-Fzo1p, HA-Fzo1-825p, Mgm1p, or Om45p in the pellets. These results clearly show that Fzo1-825p is defective in interaction with Ugo1p in vivo. Although it is highly reduced, we observed small amounts of HA-Fzo1-825p that coprecipitated with Myc-Ugo1p. It is possible that there are weak interaction domains elsewhere in these proteins. Alternatively, there might be additional proteins that bridge the interaction between Fzo1p and Ugo1p. Furthermore, we determined whether functional Mgm1p is required for interactions between Ugo1p and Fzo1p because Mgm1p coimmunoprecipitates with both Ugo1p and Fzo1p (Fig. 2A) (11Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Scott S.V. Okreglak V. Holewinske T.J. Cassidy-Stone A. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 12Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2342-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Although mitochondria isolated from cells lacking Mgm1p contain normal amounts of Fzo1p, Fzo1p was rapidly degraded in detergent-solubilized mitochondria, therefore making immunoprecipitation experiments difficult (data not shown). To overcome this problem, we expressed a mutant version of Mgm1p, Mgm1S224p, which carries a point mutation in the GTPase domain. Mgm1S224p is normally expressed in mitochondria, but these mitochondria are defective in fusion (11Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Scott S.V. Okreglak V. Holewinske T.J. Cassidy-Stone A. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 12Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2342-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 20Shepard K.A. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In detergent-solubilized mitochondria containing Mgm1S224p, Fzo1p appeared to be stable, and its level was comparable with that seen in wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 2C). When Myc-Ugo1p was immunoprecipitated, similar amounts of HA-Fzo1p coprecipitated from mitochondrial extracts containing either wild-type Mgm1p or Mgm1S224p (Fig. 2C). In addition, the wild-type and mutant versions of Mgm1p similarly coprecipitated with Myc-Ugo1p. These results indicate that a functional GTPase of Mgm1p is not required for interactions of Ugo1p with Fzo1p and Mgm1p. The Ugo1p-Fzo1p Interaction Is Required for Mitochondrial Shape, mtDNA Maintenance, and Mitochondrial Fusion—To determine the function of Ugo1p-Fzo1p interactions, we observed the mitochondrial shape and mtDNA in fzo1Δ cells carrying pRS314-FZO1 (referred to as wild-type cells), pRS314 (fzo1Δ cells), or pRS314-fzo1-825 (fzo1-825 cells). Mitochondria were visualized using an OM-targeted OM45-GFP fusion protein (29Cerveny K.L. McCaffery J.M. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, wild-type cells contain 5–10 tubular mitochondria with occasional branches. In contrast, fzo1Δ and fzo1-825 cells displayed highly fragmented mitochondria. Quantitation of mitochondrial shape showed that more than 95% of fzo1Δ and fzo1-825 cells contained fragmented mitochondria, whereas only 5% of wild-type cells contained fragmented mitochondria (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the Ugo1p-Fzo1p interaction is important for mitochondrial shape. To examine mtDNA, wild-type, fzo1Δ, and fzo1-825 cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and tested for growth on glycerol/ethanol-containing medium. Wild-type cells contained many mtDNA nucleoids (Fig. 3, A and C) and grew on both glucose-containing medium (YEPD) and glycerol/ethanol-containing medium (YEPGE) (Fig. 3D). In contrast, fzo1Δ and fzo1-825 cells lacked mtDNA nucleoids and grew on YEPD but not YEPGE. These results suggest that the Ugo1p-Fzo1p interaction is required for maintenance of mtDNA. The mitochondrial fragmentation and mtDNA loss in fzo1-825 cells suggested that fzo1-825 cells are defective in mitochondrial fusion. To directly test this possibility, we observed mitochondrial fusion during yeast cell mating (12Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2342-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The mitochondria in MATa cells were marked using an IM-targeted Yta10p-CFP fusion protein. In MATα cells, mitochondria were labeled with an IM-targeted Yta10p-YFP fusion. Both fusion proteins were expressed under the control of the inducible GAL1 promoter. MATa and MATα cells were pregrown in galactose-containing medium to induce the expression of the fusion proteins and were transferred to glucose-containing medium to inhibit their further synthesis. MATa and MATα cells were then mated on glucose-containing medium. If mitochondria fuse in the resulting zygotes, the CFP and YFP signals will colocalize. If mitochondria do not fuse, CFP and YFP will be seen in separate organelles. We found that fzo1-825 and fzo1-825 dnm1Δ cells fail to fuse their mitochondria. Fig. 4 shows representative examples of zygotes with a medial diploid bud from each mating mixture. We examined 50 zygotes for each type of cells (wild-type, dnm1Δ, fzo1-825, and fzo1-825 dnm1Δ). When two wild-type haploids mated, the mitochondria in the zygote fused, their IM contents were mixed, and the CFP and YFP fluorescence overlapped. Mitochondrial fusion also occurred in zygotes formed between dnm1Δ mutants. In contrast, when two fzo1-825 cells were mated, mitochondrial fragments containing only CFP or YFP were observed. Although the disruption of DNM1 suppressed the fragmentation of mitochondria and the loss of mtDNA (data not shown), fzo1-825 dnm1Δ double mutants were unable to fuse their mitochondria. In fzo1-825 dnm1Δ zygotes, we frequently found that two mitochondrial tubules, one derived from each parent, entered the diploid bud and were closely positioned, but nonetheless these mitochondria did not fuse and contained only CFP or YFP. These results clearly demonstrate that the Ugo1p-Fzo1p interaction is required for mitochondrial fusion. Ugo1p Connects Fzo1p and Mgm1p—Because Ugo1p directly interacts with both Fzo1p and Mgm1p, we asked if Ugo1p links these two GTPases. To test this model, we performed coimmunoprecipitation between Fzo1p and Mgm1p in the presence and absence of Ugo1p. Mitochondria were isolated from fzo1Δ dnm1Δ cells expressing HA-Fzo1p and fzo1Δ dnm1Δ ugo1Δ cells expressing HA-Fzo1p. After solubilizing mitochondria, we immunoprecipitated HA-Fzo1p and assessed whether Mgm1p coprecipitated by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5, ∼3% of Mgm1p coprecipitated with HA-Fzo1p from mitochondrial extracts containing Ugo1p, confirming our previous observations (12Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2342-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In contrast, although both HA-Fzo1p and Mgm1p are expressed at normal levels, barely detectable amounts of Mgm1p coprecipitated with HA-Fzo1p from mitochondrial extracts lacking Ugo1p. These results clearly indicate that Ugo1p is required for interaction between Fzo1p and Mgm1p. It is possible that Ugo1p functions as a structural linker that holds Fzo1p and Mgm1p together by directly binding to these two GTPases. Alternatively, Ugo1p might regulate the formation of Fzo1p-Mgm1p complexes by modulating their GTPase activities. In this scenario, Ugo1p would not be required to maintain the Fzo1p-Mgm1p complex once it formed. Although interactions of Ugo1p with these GTPases take place independently of their GTPase domains, it would be of great interest to examine whether Ugo1p regulates their GTPase activities and thereby controls mitochondrial fusion. Fritz et al. (28Fritz S. Rapaport D. Klanner E. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) proposed the model that mitochondrial fusion is mediated by a fusion machinery located in contact sites where the OM and IM are closely positioned. This model provides a mechanism that coordinates OM fusion with IM fusion in the double membrane-bound organelle. Supporting this model, the IMS domain of Fzo1p is peripherally associated with the IMS side of the IM and anchors Fzo1p to contact sites (28Fritz S. Rapaport D. Klanner E. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As with Fzo1p, we found that the 100-kDa form of Mgm1p is enriched at contact sites using submitochondrial fractionation. 2A. E. Aiken Hobbs and H. Sesaki, unpublished data. Because Fzo1p binds to Mgm1p in an Ugo1p-dependent manner, it is likely that Fzo1p is located at contact sites by interacting with Mgm1p and Ugo1p. We suggest that the Ugo1p regulates the Mgm1p-Fzo1p interaction at a key step that couples OM fusion to IM fusion. Fzo1p and Mgm1p GTPase are conserved from yeast to humans, but a mammalian homolog of Ugo1p has not been identified based on its amino acid sequence. Because mitofusin (30Santel A. Fuller M.T. J.

However, their biological functions after birth are less understood. To investigate the role of BMPs during bone remodeling, we generated a postnatal osteoblast-specific disruption of Bmpr1a that encodes the type IA receptor for BMPs in mice. Mutant mice were smaller than controls up to 6 months after birth. Irregular calcification and low bone mass were observed, but there were normal numbers of osteoblasts. The ability of the mutant osteoblasts to form mineralized nodules in culture was severely reduced. Interestingly, bone mass was increased in aged mutant mice due to reduced bone resorption evidenced by reduced bone turnover. The mutant mice lost more bone after ovariectomy likely resulting from decreased osteoblast function which could not overcome ovariectomy-induced bone resorption. In organ culture of bones from aged mice, ablation of the Bmpr1a gene by adenoviral Cre recombinase abolished the stimulatory effects of BMP4 on the expression of lysosomal enzymes essential for osteoclastic bone resorption. These results demonstrate essential and age-dependent roles for BMP signaling mediated by BMPRIA (a type IA receptor for BMP) in osteoblasts for bone remodeling.

These results demonstrate essential and age-dependent roles for BMP signaling mediated by BMPRIA (a type IA receptor for BMP) in osteoblasts for bone remodeling. Bone formation is a well characterized process; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate bone remodeling, the physiological process through which bone mass is maintained constant. Remodeling consists of two distinct phases: initial bone resorption by the osteoclasts, followed by de novo bone formation by the osteoblasts (1Ducy P. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Science. 2000; 289: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Differentiated osteoblasts are the only cells responsible for bone formation. Bone formation is thought to be regulated by hormones and by locally acting growth factors (2Takeda S. Elefteriou F. Karsenty G. Annu. Rev.

We previously generated a null allele for Bmpr1a that encodes a type IA receptor for BMP (BMPRIA or ALK3). Mice homozygous for this null allele died by embryonic day 8.0 (E8.0) without mesoderm formation (13Mishina Y. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Behringer R.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3027-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Bmpr1a is expressed in most tissues throughout development and after birth (13Mishina Y. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Behringer R.R.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2652-2663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of a dominant-negative form of BMPRIA in a cultured cell line or chick limb buds suggests that signaling through this receptor regulates apoptosis and adipocyte differentiation (15Yokouchi Y. Sakiyama J. Kameda T. Iba H. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Kuroiwa A. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3723-3734Google Scholar, 16Chen D. Ji X. Harris M.A. Feng J.Q. Karsenty G. Celeste A.J. Rosen V. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a constitutive-active form of BMPRIA in chicken limb buds suggests that signaling through this receptor also can regulate chondrocyte differentiation (17Zou H. Wieser R. Massague J. Niswander L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2191-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). However, the essential role of BMPRIA in bone formation and bone metabolism in the adult skeleton is not known. To investigate the role of BMPRIA signaling at later stages of development, we generated a conditional null allele of Bmpr1a using the Cre/loxP system (18Nagy A. Genesis. 2000; 26: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 19Mishina Y. Hanks M.C. Miura S. Tallquist M.D. Behringer R.R. Genesis. 2002; 32: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Because Bmpr1a is expressed in osteoblasts (20Ishidou Y. Kitajima I. Obama H. Maruyama I. Murata F. Imamura T. Yamada N. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Sakou T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1651-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we designed a postnatal, differentiated osteoblast-specific disruption of Bmpr1a to elucidate the requirement of BMP signaling for bone formation (21Dacquin R. Starbuck M. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Mice—The generation of Bmpr1a conditional null mice was reported elsewhere (19Mishina Y. Hanks M.C. Miura S. Tallquist M.D. Behringer R.R. Genesis. 2002; 32: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Briefly, one loxP site was placed in intron 1, and two others were placed in intron 2 flanking a PGK-neo cassette (fn allele). After germ line transmission, mice heterozygous for the fn allele were mated with CMV-Cre transgenic mice to remove the neo cassette by Cre-dependent recombination in vivo (fx allele). Both the fn allele and the fx allele behaved as wild type, indicating that the presence of the PGK-neo cassette or the loxP sites in the Bmpr1a locus did not reduce Bmpr1a activity (19Mishina Y. Hanks M.C. Miura S. Tallquist M.D. Behringer R.R. Genesis. 2002; 32: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). For the studies reported here we used both the fn and fx alleles. Mice heterozygous for Bmpr1a null allele (+/-) were bred to Og2-Cre transgenic mice (21Dacquin R. Starbuck M. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) to generate Bmpr1a(+/-),Og2-Cre(+) mice. These mice were bred to Bmpr1a fn/fn or fx/fx mice. Theoretically, 25% of the progeny should be transheterozygous for fn (or fx) and null alleles and also carry the Og2-Cre transgene to execute osteoblast-specific disruption of Bmpr1a. All experimental procedures were performed according to ethical guidelines approved by local authorities. Genotyping—Mouse genotypes were initially determined by Southern blot described elsewhere (19Mishina Y. Hanks M.C. Miura S. Tallquist M.D. Behringer R.R. Genesis. 2002; 32: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In brief, genomic DNA from the tail was digested with NheI and SacI and probed with a 0.8-kb HindIII fragment that contained exon 3. Subsequently, each allele was identified by PCR (see Fig. 2C) using the following primers: primer 1, 5′-GGTTTGGATCTTAACCTTAGG-3′; primer 2, 5′-GCAGCTGCTGCTGCAGCCTCC-3′; primer 3, 5′-AGACTGCCTTGGGAAAAGCGC-3′; and primer 4, 5′-TGGCTACAATTTGTCTCATGC-3′. Osteoblast Culture—106 bone marrow cells collected from femurs were plated in mineralization medium (α-minimal essential medium, 0.1 mg/ml ascorbic acid, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate) in 35-mm culture dishes and cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C (22Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4013-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After 4 weeks, the cultures were scored for osteoblastic colonies by staining for alkaline phosphatase to assess osteoblast differentiation and von Kossa stain for mineral deposition (22Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4013-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Bone Histomorphometry—Animals were injected with calcein (5 mg/kg of body weight) twice at 4-day intervals and sacrificed 2 days later. Histomorphometric analyses were carried out according to standard protocols (23Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4921) Google Scholar). Measurement of Bone Mineral Density—Whole right femora were dissected and completely cleaned of all tissue for peripheral duel photon x-ray absorptiometry (pDXA) determination of bone mineral content and bone mineral density (BMD) of the whole femur, central femur (central 50%), and distal 25% of the femur. These data were obtained using a Norland™ Saber pDXA scanner set at a resolution of 0.1 × 0.1 mm and a scan speed of 2 mm/s. Mouse Calvarial and Tibia Organ Culture—The calvaria and tibia from aged mice (12 months old on average) that were homozygous for fx were excised and cut in half along the sagittal suture (calvaria) or perpendicular to the long axis (tibia). Each portion was placed in a 24-well tissue culture dish containing 0.5 ml of BGJb medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 150 μg/ml vitamin C (Sigma) (43Traianedes K. Dallas M.R. Garrett I.R. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cre-dependent recombination was induced by infection with recombinant adenovirus that expresses Cre recombinase (a gift from Dr. Robert Sobol), with 108 plaque-forming units/ml in culture for 7 days. Bone samples were subsequently cultured for 11 days with or without recombinant BMP4 (100 ng/ml, R&D Systems). Tibia were flushed to remove bone marrow before RNA extraction. RNA Isolation—Frozen calvaria and tibia from organ cultures were pooled (2 samples/pool, n = 3/group) together, crushed, and homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) using a Polytron PT 10-35. Total RNA was extracted from bone samples using a Purescript RNA Isolation Kit (Gentra Systems) followed by DNase treatment on RNeasy Micro-columns (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR—Bmpr1a, cathepsin K (Ctsk), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Mmp9), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) expression were determined by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis using an Applied Biosystems 7700 Sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems). cDNA was prepared using TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents (Applied Biosystems). PCR reactions were performed in duplicate using the TaqMan PCR Core Reagent Kit (Applied Biosystems), a 200 nm concentration of each primer and probe, and 10 μl of cDNA template according to manufacturer's instructions. Gene-specific primers and fluorescence-labeled probes (5′-reporter dye, 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM); 3′-quencher dye, 6-carboxy-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) were designed using Primer Express (version 1.5) software (Applied Biosystems) and synthesized by Applied Biosystems. Primer sequences were as follows: Bmpr1a (intact), TCATGTTCAAGGGCAGAATCTAGA (forward) and GGCAAGGTATCCTCTGGTGCTA (reverse); probe-FAM, AAATCAGACTTGGACCAGAAGAAGCCAGAAA; Bmpr1a (missing exon 2), GTTCATCATTTCTCATGTTCA(-/A/AG/AGG)AACTA (forward) and AATCAGAGCCTTCATACTTCATACACC (reverse); probe-FAM, CCATTATAGAAGAAGATGATCAGGGAGAAACCACATTA; Ctsk, CCATATGTGGGCCAGGATG (forward) and AGGAATCTCTCTGTACCCTCTGCA (reverse); probe-FAM, TGTATGTATAACGCCACGGCAAAGGCA; MMP-9, TGTCTGGAGATTCGACTTGAAGTC (forward) and TGAGTTCCAGGGCACACCA (reverse); probe-FAM, CCCAGAGCGTCATTCGCGTGGATA; TRAP, AATGCCTCGAGACCTGGGA (forward) and CGTAGTCCTCCTTGGCTGCT (reverse); probe-FAM, CGCACTCAGCTGTCCTGGCTCAA. The comparative Ct method was used to measure RNA expression levels, while glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA Control Reagents (Applied Biosystems) were used for normalization. Disruption of the Type IA Receptor for BMPs in a Differentiated Osteoblast-specific manner—Osteocalcin2 (Og2) is specifically expressed in differentiated osteoblasts only after birth (24Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 25Desbois C. Hogue D.A. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1183-1190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To direct Cre recombinase in postnatal differentiated osteoblasts, we used transgenic mice that carry a 1.3-kb mouse Og2 upstream region ligated to the Cre recombinase gene (21Dacquin R. Starbuck M. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Osteoblast-specific Cre activity was examined by crosses with CAT-lacZ mice that report Cre activity by β-galactosidase expression (26Araki K. Araki M. Miyazaki J. Vassalli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In Og2-Cre, CAT-lacZ double heterozygotes, all bones stained positively for β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1A), resembling the β-galactosidase pattern of Og2-lacZ transgenic mice (27Frendo J.L. Xiao G. Fuchs S. Franceschi R.T. Karsenty G. Ducy P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30509-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was observed only in the osteoblasts on trabecular bone near the growth plates and on cortical bone surfaces (Fig. 1, B, C, E, and F). No β-galactosidase activity was detected in the soft tissues, bone marrow, or chondrocytes, indicating that expression of Cre in Og2-Cre mice was highly specific for osteoblasts. Pups transheterozygous for the conditional null and null alleles of Bmpr1a, and hemizygous for the Og2-Cre transgene, were recovered after birth. As shown in Fig. 2A, they were smaller than their control littermates at 2 months of age. Smaller body size was recognizable as early as 3 weeks of age and became more prominent at 6 or 12 weeks (Fig. 2B). Their body weight remained below normal for up to 6 months. Because the proportion of the mature osteoblasts was too small for detection of the Cre-dependent recombination by Southern blot, floxed and recombined alleles were differentiated by PCR. All of the mice that carried the Og2-Cre transgene showed at least one recombined allele that had deleted exon 2 (Fig. 2C). Reduced Osteoblast Function in the Mutant Mice—Contact x-ray photography of 3-month-old mice showed no overt changes in bone shape compared with controls (Fig. 3A). However, irregular calcification was found, most prominently in femurs (Fig. 3, B and C, arrow). Histological analysis showed decreased bone trabeculae (Fig. 3, D and E) with no growth plate abnormalities. Osteopontin and osteocalcin were expressed normally in the mutant bones (data not shown). To investigate the cause of the altered bone formation, we performed a morphometric analysis of undecalcified histological sections (23Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4921) Google Scholar), which revealed a decrease in bone volume in the mutant mice that was about half of that in their control littermates (Fig. 3F). Bone formation rate was reduced in mutants in comparison with controls (Fig. 3G). In addition, the numbers of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in tibia and spine did not differ significantly between mutants and their controls (data not shown). Consistent with the morphometric analysis, in in vitro culture of bone marrow cells from mutant and control mice, the osteoblastic colonies derived from Bmpr1a fx/-,Og2-Cre(+) mice were smaller than those derived from control cells and stained poorly for mineral deposition (Fig. 4, A and B). Fewer alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies and von Kossa-positive colonies were observed in the culture derived from bone marrow cells in mutant mice (Fig. 4C). Taken together, the in vivo and in vitro analyses suggest that osteoblast-specific Bmpr1a disruption leads to less osteoblast function and loss of bone formation, resulting in decreased bone remodeling and decreased body size in mutant mice. Reduced Osteoclast Activity in Aged Mutant Mice—Although younger mutant mice (up to 6 months) weighed less than controls (Fig. 2), the difference became smaller as they got older (data not shown). Intriguingly, BMD in 10-month-old mutant mice was significantly higher than that of controls (Fig. 5A, WT/Sham and KO/Sham, B, and D). Because there were no significant differences in BMD observed at 3 months of age (data not shown), these findings suggested that loss of BMP signaling in osteoblasts might lead to down-regulation of osteoclast function as the mice aged. Histomorphometric analysis of femurs of 10-month-old mice confirmed the higher bone volume (BV/TV (bone volume per total volume)) in mutant mice compared with controls (Fig. 5F, WT/Sham and KO/Sham). Dynamic histomorphometric analysis with double calcein labeling documented that bone turnover (BFR/BS (bone formation rate per total bone surface)) is decreased in mutant mice (Fig. 5G, WT/Sham and KO/Sham), indicating that increased bone mass in mutant mice is due to decreased bone resorption. These results suggest that, in aged animals, loss of BMP signaling via BMPRIA in osteoblasts may lead to suppression of osteoclast function and bone resorption. To gain further insights into the role of BMPRIA and BMP signaling in adult bone metabolism, we evaluated the effects of ovariectomy (OVX) that activates bone turnover and osteoclastic bone resorption, leading to bone loss. Interestingly, the loss of BMD in the OVX group, compared with the sham operated group, was more significant in mutant mice (Fig. 5A). Histological observations agreed with the BMD findings (Fig. 5, B-E). More trabecular bone is observed in the distal femur of the mutant mice compared with the controls, and in both mutant and control mice, trabecular bone was severely reduced by OVX. Quantitative histomorphometric analysis confirmed these findings by documenting the significant reduction of bone volume (BV/TV) in OVX groups to Sham-operated groups with more significant effects of OVX observed in mutant mice (Fig. 5F). More significant bone loss induced by OVX in mutant mice likely results from the decreased osteoblast function, observed in vivo and in vitro analyses in young animals, that became evident in high bone turnover induced by OVX. Taken together, the increased bone mass and the greater degree of bone loss induced by OVX in the mutant mice suggest that the activity of osteoclasts as well as osteoblasts is reduced in the aged osteoblast-specific Bmpr1a-deficient mice, leading to the complex skeletal phenotype. To further investigate the above mentioned hypothesis, we used a bone organ culture system to evaluate the impact of ablation of Bmpr1a on the genes associated with osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Calvarias from aged mice, that were homozygous for floxed Bmpr1a, were treated with adenoviral Cre recombinase and effects of BMP4 on the expression of marker genes were assessed by real-time PCR. Cre-dependent deletion of Bmpr1a was confirmed by significant reduction of the levels of wild-type transcript (Fig. 6A) and induction of the Bmpr1a transcript lacking exon 2 (Fig. 6B). In the control culture, expression levels of TRAP, Mmp9, and Ctsk, lysosomal enzymes secreted from osteoclasts, in calvaria were all increased with BMP4 treatment. These results are consistent with the role of the BMPRIA signaling pathway in osteoclastic bone resorption postulated by the reduced bone resorption observed in mutant mice. In contrast, in calvaria following treatment with Cre recombinase that inactivates Bmpr1a, BMP4 treatment showed no effects on the levels of expression of TRAP, Mmp9, and Ctsk (Fig. 6, C-E). Basal levels of these enzymes were also reduced by inactivation of Bmpr1a. Interestingly, the expression of calcitonin receptor, a marker of osteoclast, was not induced by BMP4 nor regulated by treatment with Cre recombinase (data not shown), suggesting the specific effects of the BMP-BMPRIA signaling pathway in expression of lysosomal enzymes essential for osteoclastic bone resorption. Expression of RANKL that is expressed in osteoblasts to support osteoclast function was not changed by Cre treatment (data not shown). Similar results were observed by organ culture of tibia from the same animals (data not shown). Analysis of marker genes for osteoblasts, such as type I collagen or osteocalcin, did not show significant changes under these experimental conditions (data not shown). Our results show that signaling through the BMP type IA receptor in differentiated osteoblasts plays an important role in bone formation when mice are relatively young (>6 months of age). The mutant mice showed reduced body weight, lower bone volume, and reduced bone formation rate. This signal is apparently not be essential for osteoblast differentiation or proliferation but is important for the production of bone matrix by differentiated osteoblasts. Intriguingly, the differentiated osteoblast-specific disruption of the BMP type IA receptor leads to an opposite phenotype when mice become older (at 10 months of age). Bone volume in the mutant mice was higher than that of control littermates even though bone formation rate was still lower in the mutants. The mutant mice that were ovariectomized showed the same BMD and bone volume as the controls that were ovariectomized, suggesting that BMP signaling through the type IA receptor in the differentiated osteoblasts may be important for regulating osteoclast activity. This hypothesis is supported by the induction of lysosomal enzymes essential for osteoclastic bone resorption by BMP4 in calvarial organ culture that is abolished following inactivation of Bmpr1a. It has been shown that alteration of BMP signaling during embryogenesis affects skeletalgenesis (6Kingsley D.M. Bland A.E. Grubber J.M. Marker P.C. Russell L.B. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A.

Recently, linkage of osteoporosis to chromosome 20p12 where BMP2 resides was demonstrated in a Danish population (36Styrkarsdottir U. Cazier J.-B. Kong A. Rolfsson O. Larsen H. Bjarnadottir E.

These results suggest that BMP signaling in the osteoblasts plays important roles in bone formation during younger stages of life, consistent to the results presented here. It has been reported that osteoblasts play essential roles in supporting the generation and activity of osteoclasts that are critical for bone resorption (37Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Udagawa N.

Although we cannot exclude the possible role for Cre-dependent inactivation of Bmpr1a in osteoclasts in the loss of BMP induction of lysozomal enzymes in organ culture, these results along with in vivo results suggest that BMP signaling in osteoblasts controls bone resorption by supporting osteoclast function in aged mice. Our results suggest that BMP functions in differentiated osteoblasts are altered in an age-dependent manner, initially for bone formation at younger ages, then more predominantly for supporting osteoclast function as animals age.

The activity of both enzymes was latent in intact vesicles, indicating the intraluminal localization of their active sites. Glucose-6-phosphate, a substrate for hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, stimulated the cortisone reductase activity of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. Inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate uptake by S3483, a specific inhibitor of the microsomal glucose-6-phosphate transporter, decreased this effect. Similarly, cortisone increased the intravesicular accumulation of radioactivity upon the addition of radiolabeled glucose-6-phosphate, indicating the stimulation of hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. A correlation was shown between glucose-6-phosphate-dependent cortisone reduction and cortisone-dependent glucose-6-phosphate oxidation. The results demonstrate a close cooperation of the enzymes based on co-localization and the mutual generation of cofactors for each other.

Similarly, cortisone increased the intravesicular accumulation of radioactivity upon the addition of radiolabeled glucose-6-phosphate, indicating the stimulation of hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. A correlation was shown between glucose-6-phosphate-dependent cortisone reduction and cortisone-dependent glucose-6-phosphate oxidation. The results demonstrate a close cooperation of the enzymes based on co-localization and the mutual generation of cofactors for each other. The endoplasmic reticulum is a separate subcellular compartment with properties different from those of the cytosol. Its lumen is characterized by an oxidative redox potential (1Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar), which is maintained by the relative impermeability of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane toward numerous redox-active compounds, including pyridine nucleotides.Because the oxidoreductases of the lumen have to use a separate NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H pool, a functional cooperation between intraluminal oxidases and reductases has been hypothesized (2Sawada H. Hara A. Hayashibara M. Nakayama T. Usui S. Saeki T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 3Sawada H. Hayashibara M. Hara A. Nakayama T. J. Biochem.

Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH) 1The abbreviations used are: H6PDH, hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 11β-HSD1, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1; G6PT, glucose-6-phosphate transporter; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: H6PDH, hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 11β-HSD1, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1; G6PT, glucose-6-phosphate transporter; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. is supposed to have a key role in the generation of reducing equivalents, which can be used by several reductases present in the lumen that include, among others, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1).H6PDH is the microsomal counterpart of the cytosolic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; both enzymes utilize glucose-6-phosphate and NADP+. However, the microsomal enzyme accepts other hexose-6-phosphates (6Clarke J.L. Mason P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The substrate supply of the enzyme is ensured by the glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT) of the endoplasmic reticulum, which is specific for glucose-6-phosphate (7Chou J.Y. Matern D. Mansfield B.C. Chen Y.T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 121-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). H6PDH is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the first two reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway (6Clarke J.L. Mason P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Ozols J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5302-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Collard F. Collet J.F. Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It contains hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconolactonase activities on a single polypeptide chain. The dehydrogenase activity of the enzyme is latent in microsomal vesicles because of the limited membrane permeability to NADP+ (10Hori S.H. Takahashi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 496: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 11Takahashi T. Hori S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 262-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Takahashi T. Hori S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 672: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).11β-HSD1 is mainly expressed in liver and adipose tissue (13Seckl J.R. Walker B.R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The enzyme can act either as a dehydrogenase or a reductase according to the local redox potential (possibly regulated by H6PDH). In vivo conditions favor reductase activity (which may suggest a high NADPH/NADP+ ratio in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen.) The physiological role of the enzyme is supposed to be the regulation of local glucocorticoid levels in the target tissues. In cortisone reductase deficiency, the activation of cortisone to cortisol is missing, which results in a phenotype resembling polycystic ovary syndrome (14Jamieson A. Wallace A.M. Andrew R. Nunez B.S. Walker B.R. Fraser R. White P.C. Connell J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 3570-3574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 11β-HSD1 plays also a role in biotransformation; it can reduce various ketones such as metyrapone and its derivatives (15Maser E. Bannenberg G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Sampath-Kumar R. Yu M. Khalil M.W. Yang K. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

The topology of the enzyme is known, and the active site can be found in the lumen (18Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2305-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Recent observations suggest that 11β-HSD1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. The enzyme regenerates active glucocorticoids from inactive forms and plays a central role in regulating intracellular glucocorticoid concentration, which is commonly elevated in fat depots from obese individuals. This suggests a role for local glucocorticoid reactivation in obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Visceral fat accumulation and insulin resistance are not observed in 11β-HSD1 knockout mice even on a high fat diet (19Kotelevtsev Y. Holmes M.C. Burchell A. Houston P.M. Schmoll D. Jamieson P. Best R. Brown R. Edwards C.R. Seckl J.R. Mullins J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14924-14929Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fat-specific 11β-HSD1 transgenic mice, having an increased enzyme activity to an extent similar to that seen in obese humans, develop visceral obesity with insulin and leptin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (20Masuzaki H. Yamamoto H. Kenyon C.J. Elmquist J.K. Morton N.M. Paterson J.M. Shinyama H. Sharp M.G. Fleming S. Mullins J.J. Seckl J.R. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Recently reported selective inhibitors of 11β-HSD1 can ameliorate severe hyperglycemia in the genetically diabetic obese mice (21Alberts P. Nilsson C. Selen G. Engblom L.O. Edling N.H. Norling S. Klingstrom G. Larsson C. Forsgren M. Ashkzari M. Nilsson C.E. Fiedler M. Bergqvist E. Ohman B. Bjorkstrand E. Abrahmsen L.B. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4755-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Therefore, 11β-HSD1 is a promising pharmaceutical target for the treatment of metabolic syndrome.The coupling of the activities of H6PDH and 11β-HSD1 has already been suggested in early studies on the basis of cofactor requirements (2Sawada H. Hara A. Hayashibara M. Nakayama T. Usui S. Saeki T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 3Sawada H. Hayashibara M. Hara A. Nakayama T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 985-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that mutations in the genes of the two enzymes interact to cause cortisone reductase deficiency (5Draper N. Walker E.A. Bujalska I.J. Tomlinson J.W. Chalder S.M. Arlt W. Lavery G.G. Bedendo O. Ray D.W. Laing I. Malunowicz E. White P.C. Hewison M. Mason P.J. Connell J.M. Shackleton C.H. Stewart P.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence for the cooperation is missing. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the H6PDH-stimulated cortisol production and the 11β-HSD1-stimulated oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate in rat liver microsomal vesicles.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Rat Liver Microsomes—Rat liver microsomes were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250-g body weights) as has been reported (22Bánhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Fulceri R. Hinds C. Burchell A. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13584-13590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Microsomes resuspended in MOPS buffer (100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2) were rapidly frozen and stored in liquid N2 until used. The intactness of the vesicles was checked by measuring the latency of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity (23Fulceri R. Bánhegyi G. Gamberucci A. Giunti R. Mandl J. Benedetti A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Latency was >95% in every microsomal preparation. The protein concentration of microsomes was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay solution with bovine serum albumin as a standard according to the manufacturer's instructions.Measurement of Enzyme Activities—Microsomes were incubated in MOPS buffer (see above) at 22 °C. H6PDH activity was measured by fluorometric detection of NADPH in the presence of 10 μm glucose-6-phosphate plus 100 μm NADP+. Microsomes were permeabilized by the addition of alamethicin (0.1 mg/mg protein). The reaction was carried out in the fluorometer cuvette at 350-nm excitation and 460-nm emission wavelengths by using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian). The time course of NADPH formation was registered. For the measurement of cortisone reductase activity of 11β-HSD1, microsomes were incubated in the same buffer at 22 °C. Incubations were terminated by the addition of dichloromethane, the extraction was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, and cortisol was detected by an enzyme-linked fluorescent assay (ELFA; bioMérieux, Lyon, France).Transport Measurements—Liver microsomes (1 mg protein/ml) were incubated in MOPS buffer containing 10 μm vanadate (to inhibit glucose-6-phosphatase activity) (22Bánhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Fulceri R. Hinds C. Burchell A. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13584-13590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.01–10 mm glucose-6-phosphate plus d-[14C]glucose-6-phosphate (2–3 mCi/ml) at 22 °C. At the indicated time intervals, samples (0.1 ml) were rapidly filtered through cellulose acetate/nitrate filter membranes (pore size 0.22 μm), and filters were washed with 4 ml of Hepes (20 mm) buffer (pH 7.2) containing 250 mm sucrose and 0.5 mm 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid. This latter compound was added to reduce the eventual efflux of vesicular glucose-6-phosphate during the washing procedure. The total radioactivity associated with microsomes retained by the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting. In each experiment, alamethicin (0.1 mg/ml; 23) was added to the parallel incubates to distinguish the intravesicular and the bound radioactivity. The alamethicin-permeabilized microsomes were recovered on filters and washed as explained above. The alamethicin-releasable part of radioactivity was calculated and regarded as intraluminal.Materials—Glucose-6-phosphate (monosodium salt), alamethicin, NADP+, NADPH, and cortisone were obtained from Sigma. S3483 was kindly supplied by Aventis Pharma. Na3VO4 was from Fisher Science Co. d-[14C]glucose-6-phosphate (300 mCi/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO. Cellulose acetate/nitrate filter membranes (pore size 0.22 μm) were from Millipore. All other chemicals were of analytical grade.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONH6PDH and Cortisone Reductase Activities and Their Latency in Rat Liver Microsomes—H6PDH activity (by using glucose-6-phosphate as substrate) and cortisone reductase activity of 11β-HSD1 were measured in rat liver microsomes. H6PDH activity, detected on the basis of the reduction of added NADP+, was hardly measurable in intact vesicles (Fig. 1A, trace d). In control samples without glucose-6-phosphate, a similar small reduction of NADP+ was also present (Fig. 1A, trace c). The negligible extravesicular activity rules out the contamination of vesicles with cytosolic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Permeabilization of the microsomes with the pore-forming agent alamethicin resulted in an ∼10-fold increase in the activity (Fig. 1A, trace a). The calculated latency of H6PDH was 90%. In control samples without glucose-6-phosphate, virtually no reduction of NADP+ was present (Fig. 1A, trace e). Because glucose-6-phosphate is transported across the microsomal membrane by G6PT, the latency is due to the limited permeability to NADP+. Similarly to H6PDH, cortisone reductase activity stimulated by the addition of NADPH could be increased by alamethicin-permeabilization (Fig. 1B). The latency of the enzyme was ∼80%. These results confirm that the active sites of the two enzymes are co-localized in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and that they are not easily accessible for the cytosolic pyridine nucleotides.It should be noted that a cortisone reductase activity, which was not dependent on added NADPH, could be observed in intact microsomes. Without the addition of NADPH, a slow but progressive cortisol formation was measured (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2), which could be almost completely abolished by permeabilization (Fig. 1B). The result is not surprising, because the presence of a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide pool was reported in liver microsomes (24Bublitz C. Lawler C.A. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The finding suggests that this pool is present predominantly in reduced form in the vesicles.Fig. 2Glucose-6-phosphate stimulates cortisone reduction in rat liver microsomes. Microsomes (1 mg/ml protein) were incubated at 22 °C in MOPS buffer containing 10 μm cortisone in the presence (squares) or absence (circles) of glucose-6-phosphate (10 μm). Where indicated by empty squares, microsomes were preincubated with S3483 (20 μm) for 5 min to inhibit G6PT. Cortisol production was measured as reported under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are means ± S.D. of four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mutual Stimulation of H6PDH and 11β-HSD1 Activities by the Addition of Cortisone or Glucose-6-phosphate, Respectively—To investigate whether H6PDH activity can supply 11β-HSD1 with reducing equivalents and, vice versa, that 11β-HSD1 can regenerate NADP+ for H6PDH, enzyme activities were measured in intact vesicles without the addition of pyridine nucleotides. Cortisone reductase activity was detected on the basis of cortisol formation (as above). For the measurement of H6PDH activity driven by the intravesicular NADP+ pool, radiolabeled glucose-6-phosphate was used as substrate, and the intravesicular accumulation of radioactivity was detected. The other major intravesicular glucose-6-phosphate metabolizing enzyme, glucose-6-phosphatase, was inhibited by the addition of vanadate (22Bánhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Fulceri R. Hinds C. Burchell A. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13584-13590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The accumulated radioactivity represents all downstream metabolites of the pentose phosphate pathway, because not only H6PDH but also the subsequent enzymes of the pathway are present in the lumen of the vesicles (25Hino Y. Minakami S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo. 1982; 92: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Hino Y. Minakami S. J. Biol.

This experimental approach has been used successfully in other studies (28Gerin I. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Varsányi M. Szarka A. Papp E. Makai D. Nardai G. Fulceri R. Csermely P. Mandl J. Benedetti A. Bánhegyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3370-3374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The reduction of cortisone to cortisol was increased several-fold upon glucose-6-phosphate addition (Fig. 2). The addition of the G6PT inhibitor chlorogenic acid derivative S3483 (30Herling A.W. Burger H.J. Schwab D. Hemmerle H. Below P. Schubert G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G1087-G1093PubMed Google Scholar) decreased the stimulatory effect of glucose-6-phosphate, proving that the effect was due to an intravesicular event. Glucosamine-6-phosphate, which is a substrate for H6PDH (6Clarke J.L. Mason P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) but is not a ligand for G6PT, did not stimulate cortisol formation. Glucose, the substrate for a microsomal glucose dehydrogenase (31Bublitz C. Steavenson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 965: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), was also ineffective in this regard (data not shown).Similarly, cortisone increased the intravesicular accumulation of radioactivity upon the addition of radiolabeled glucose-6-phosphate. In the absence of cortisone, the fast initial microsomal uptake of radioactivity due to the equilibration of extravesicular and intravesicular glucose-6-phosphate concentrations was followed by a second, slow phase of accumulation, presumably due to an intravesicular metabolism. Therefore, the cortisone effect was more expressed after longer incubation time (Fig. 3A). The effect was concentration-dependent; 10 μm cortisone was already effective, and the maximum of the stimulation was reached at 500 μm cortisone concentration (Fig. 3B). Accordingly, the higher the glucose-6-phosphate concentration was, the higher the cortisone-dependent stimulation of the intravesicular accumulation of radioactivity was (Fig. 3C). The addition of the G6PT inhibitor S3483, as expected, resulted in a lower accumulation of radioactivity both in the absence and presence of cortisone (Fig. 3D).Fig. 3Cortisone stimulates glucose-6-phosphate metabolism in rat liver microsomes. Microsomes (1 mg/ml protein) were incubated at 22 °C in MOPS buffer containing 10 μm vanadate to inhibit glucose-6-phosphatase activity.

In the presence of 10 μm cortisone, the generation of NADPH by the microsomal H6PDH activity was decreased (control, 968 ± 45; cortisone, 741 ± 30 pmol/min/mg protein; mean ± S.D., n = 3 (see also Fig. 1, traces a and b).Correlation and Stoichiometry of H6PDH and 11β-HSD1 Activities—The glucose-6-phosphate-dependent portion of cortisone reductase activity and the cortisone-dependent accumulation of radioactivity from glucose-6-phosphate were calculated from the data of Fig. 2 and Fig. 3D, respectively. They showed similar time courses (Fig. 4). However, the stoichiometry is about 3–4:1 in favor of cortisol formation, in contrast with the theoretically expected 1:1. This discrepancy can be explained on the one hand by the presence of the second NADPH-generating enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway. 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is known to be present in the lumen of microsomes (25Hino Y. Minakami S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo. 1982; 92: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Hino Y. Minakami S. J. Biol.

On the other hand, H6PDH activity might be underestimated because of the decreasing concentration of glucose-6-phosphate and the membrane-permeable metabolites of the pentose phosphate pathway (e.g. CO2) (25Hino Y. Minakami S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo. 1982; 92: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Hino Y. Minakami S. J. Biol.

It explains the observation (5Draper N. Walker E.A. Bujalska I.J. Tomlinson J.W. Chalder S.M. Arlt W. Lavery G.G. Bedendo O. Ray D.W. Laing I. Malunowicz E. White P.C. Hewison M. Mason P.J. Connell J.M. Shackleton C.H. Stewart P.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) that H6PDH can also play a role in the pathogenesis of diseases connected to 11β-HSD1. In addition, it can also be postulated that G6PT is a potential therapeutic target; its inhibitors may lower blood glucose concentration not only by reducing the substrate supply to glucose-6-phosphatase but also by the indirect inhibition of 11β-HSD1 activity. Moreover, the results show that the assumption of the oxidative redox potential in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen defined by the thiol/disulfide ratio cannot be generalized; the redox potential of the intraluminal pyridine nucleotide pool must be much lower in vivo to allow intraluminal reductive reactions such as cortisol synthesis. The endoplasmic reticulum is a separate subcellular compartment with properties different from those of the cytosol. Its lumen is characterized by an oxidative redox potential (1Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar), which is maintained by the relative impermeability of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane toward numerous redox-active compounds, including pyridine nucleotides. Because the oxidoreductases of the lumen have to use a separate NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H pool, a functional cooperation between intraluminal oxidases and reductases has been hypothesized (2Sawada H. Hara A.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The enzyme can act either as a dehydrogenase or a reductase according to the local redox potential (possibly regulated by H6PDH). In vivo conditions favor reductase activity (which may suggest a high NADPH/NADP+ ratio in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen.) The physiological role of the enzyme is supposed to be the regulation of local glucocorticoid levels in the target tissues. In cortisone reductase deficiency, the activation of cortisone to cortisol is missing, which results in a phenotype resembling polycystic ovary syndrome (14Jamieson A. Wallace A.M. Andrew R.

GATA3-mediated chromatin remodeling at the Th2 cytokine gene loci, including Th2-specific long range histone hyperacetylation of the interleukin (IL)-13/IL-4 gene loci, occurs in developing Th2 cells. However, little is known about the role of GATA3, if any, in the maintenance of established remodeled chromatin at the Th2 cytokine gene loci. Here, we established a Cre/LoxP-based site-specific recombination system in cultured CD4 T cells using a unique adenovirus-mediated gene transfer technique. This system allowed us to investigate the effect of loss of GATA3 expression in in vitro differentiated Th2 cells. After ablation of GATA3, we detected reduced production of all Th2 cytokines, increased DNA methylation at the IL-4 gene locus, and decreased histone hyperacetylation at the IL-5 gene locus but not significantly so at the IL-13/IL-4 gene loci. Thus, GATA3 plays important roles in the maintenance of the Th2 phenotype and continuous chromatin remodeling of the specific Th2 cytokine gene locus through cell division.

We generated a precise map of the Th2-specific histone hyperacetylation within the type 2 cytokine gene loci, and identified a 71-bp conserved GATA3 response element (CGRE) 1.6 kbp upstream of the IL-13 locus exon 1 (23Yamashita M.

The conserved GATA3 response element (CGRE) may play a crucial role for GATA3-mediated targeting and downstream spreading of core histone hyperacetylation within the IL-13 and IL-4 gene loci in developing Th2 cells. However, it is still unclear whether continuous expression of GATA3 is required for the maintenance of the established chromatin remodeling at the Th2 cytokine gene loci. In the present study, we investigated the role for GATA3 in the maintenance of Th2 cytokine production and the remodeled chromatin using a newly established in vitro site-specific recombination system. The loss of GATA3 expression resulted in decreased Th2 cytokine production, reduction of histone hyperacetylation at the IL-5 gene locus, and increased DNA methylation at the IL-4 gene locus. Thus, GATA3 plays important roles in the maintenance of the Th2 phenotype and continuous chromatin remodeling of the specific Th2 cytokine gene loci.

Splenic CD4 cells were purified using magnetic beads and an Auto-MACS Sorter™ (Miltenyi Biotec), yielding purity of >98%. For Th1 differentiation, the cells (1.5 × 106) were stimulated for 2 days with immobilized anti-TCR mAb (H57–597; BD Pharmingen) and anti-CD28 mAb (37.51; BD Pharmingen) in the presence of IL-2 (25 units/ml), IL-12 (100 units/ml), and anti-IL-4 mAb (11B11, 25% culture supernatant). For Th2 cell differentiation, cells were stimulated with immobilized anti-TCR mAb and anti-CD28 mAb for 2 days in the presence of IL-2 (25 units/ml), IL-4 (100 units/ml), and anti-IFNγ mAb (R4–6A2, 25% culture supernatant). The cells were then transferred to new wells and cultured for another 3 days in the presence of only the cytokines present in the initial culture. In some experiments, two or three cycles of the anti-TCR plus anti-CD28 stimulation were used.

Retrovirus vectors containing a loxP-flanked EGFP cassette (pMX-loxP-EGFP-loxP) and a loxP-flanked human GATA3-IRES-EGFP cassette (pMX-loxP-GATA3-IRES-EGFP-loxP) were generated using the original pMX-IRES-GFP vector (31Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A).

An adenovirus vector containing a Cre recombinase expression cassette (Ad-Cre) was kindly provided by Izumi Saito (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) (Fig. 1B) (33Kanegae Y. Takamori K. Sato Y. Lee G. Nakai M. Saito I. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of loss of GATA3 expression in differentiated Th2 cells, we established a site-specific recombination system in CD4 T cells cultured in vitro. The strategy of introduction and deletion of the GATA3 transgene is illustrated in Fig. 1C. First, naive CD4 T cells were stimulated under Th1-skewed conditions, and infected with retrovirus vectors containing a loxP-flanked GATA3/IRES/EGFP cassette. Three days later, GFP-positive retrovirus-infected cells were sorted with a FACSVantage (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer and restimulated under the same Th1-skewed conditions of initial stimulation for a further 5 days. After another cycle of 5-day re-stimulation culture under Th1-skewed conditions, the cells were infected with Ad-Cre to delete the GATA3/IRES/EGFP transgene by expressing NLS-tagged Cre recombinase. The preparation of adenovirus supernatant was done as described (33Kanegae Y. Takamori K. Sato Y. Lee G. Nakai M. Saito I. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cell entry by adenovirus involves high-affinity binding of the viral fiber capsid protein to a cellular receptor, CAR. We used CAR Tg mouse T cells to avoid the limited expression of CAR on T cells (27Wan Y.Y. Leon R.P. Marks R. Cham C.M. Schaack J. Gajewski T.F. DeGregori J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Four days after infection of retrovirus vectors containing a loxP-flanked GATA3/IRES/EGFP, cells were stimulated with immobilized anti-TCR and anti-CD28 for 4 h, stained with anti-IL-4 PE detection mAbs using IL-4 Secretion Assay kit (number 130-090-515: Militenyi Biotec), and GFP+IL-4+ cells were sorted with purity >98%. The sorted cells were cultured for 6 days in the presence of cytokines (IL-2 and IL-12), and then another stimulation with anti-TCR and anti-CD28 was performed. Two days later, cells were infected with Ad-Cre. Four days after Ad-Cre infection, GFP– cells were sorted to exclude the small numbers of GFP+ (GATA3) expressing cells remaining in the culture. After T cell expansion by anti-TCR stimulation, analysis was done on day 25. To exclude the effect of endogenously induced GATA3 molecules, we used naive STAT6-deficient CD4 T cells and Th1-skewed culture conditions containing anti-IL-4 mAb throughout the 25-day cultivation.Fig. 5Effect of GATA3 depletion on Th2 cytokine production in in vitro differentiated Th2 cells.A, cytokine production profiles of Th2 cells after depletion of the GATA3 transgene prepared as in Fig. 4A were assessed by cytoplasmic staining (IFN-γ/IL-4 and IL-5/IL-4).

Efficient Adenovirus-mediated Transgene Introduction into CAR Tg CD4 T Cells in Vitro—The aim of this study was to determine the role of GATA3, if any, in the maintenance of the established Th2 phenotype and Th2-type chromatin remodeling. To investigate the effect of loss of GATA3 expression in differentiated Th2 cells, we established a Cre/loxP-mediated site-specific recombination system in T cells. The system constitutes (i) retrovirus-mediated introduction of a loxP-flanked GATA3 transgene for Th2 cell differentiation from naive CD4 T cells, and (ii) subsequent adenovirus-mediated Cre expression to delete the loxP-flanked GATA3 transgene (Fig. 1). Thus, we first evaluated the feasibility of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in T cells. Naive CD4 T cells express limited amounts of CAR and are known to be resistant to adenovirus infection. To increase the efficiency of adenovirus infection in T cells, we used CAR Tg mice expressing CAR on T cells under the control of the proximal promoter of lck and a CD2 enhancer, in which the majority of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the spleen showed high level cell surface expression of CAR (27Wan Y.Y. Leon R.P. Marks R. Cham C.M. Schaack J. Gajewski T.F. DeGregori J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13784-13789Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Freshly prepared CD4 T cells from CAR Tg mice were infected with Ad-EGFP. Two days after infection, the majority of CAR Tg CD4 T cells expressed substantial levels of GFP compared with that of non-Tg B6 CD4 T cells (Fig. 2A). A time course of the GFP expression after Ad-EGFP infection was assessed in CAR CD4 T cells cultured under Th1- or Th2-skewed conditions (Fig. 2B). The expression of GFP peaked on day 3 in either Th1 or Th2-skewed culture conditions. The high-level expression was maintained for at least 4 days after infection. Thus, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was efficient when using CD4 T cells from CAR Tg mice. Deletion of a loxP-flanked EGFP Transgene by Ad-Cre Infection in Cultured CD4 T Cells—The efficiency of Cre-mediated DNA recombination was next assessed in CAR Tg CD4 T cells using EGFP as an indicator. CAR Tg CD4 T cells were stimulated with anti-TCR mAb plus anti-CD28 mAb and infected with a retrovirus containing a loxP-flanked EGFP cassette (pMX-loxP-EGFP-loxP). GFP-expressing infected cells were sorted, restimulated for 3 days, and then infected with either 1 or 3 × 108 IFU of Ad-Cre as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3A shows a representative genomic DNA PCR result assessing the amount of EGFP transgene DNA left in CD4 T cells after Ad-Cre infection. The ratio of EGFP/input DNA is shown in Fig. 3B. The EGFP transgene content was significantly decreased 2 days after Ad-Cre infection in a virus-dosage dependent manner. On day 3, the majority of the EGFP transgene was deleted by infection with 3 × 108 IFU of Ad-Cre (Fig. 3A, bottom). These results suggest that the lox-P-flanked EGFP transgene was efficiently deleted in cultured CD4 T cells by Ad-Cre infection when CAR Tg CD4 T cells are used. Concurrently, the expression levels of EGFP protein after Ad-Cre infection were monitored by flow cytometry. To allow comparison with the EGFP-negative T cell control peak, no GFP sorting was done in this particular experiment. Shown are representative flow cytometry histograms (Fig. 3C), and relative intensity data from the GFP-positive peaks after infection with 3 × 108 IFU of Ad-Cre (Fig. 3D). As can be seen, expression levels of GFP in CAR Tg CD4 T cells decreased day by day after Ad-Cre infection, and were approximately one-fifth of the original expression level on day 4 when 3 × 108 IFU of Ad-Cre were used (Fig. 3D). In contrast, only a marginal decrease was observed in non-Tg CD4 T cell cultures. Although almost complete deletion of the EGFP transgene was detected on day 3 post-infection with 3 × 108 IFU of Ad-Cre (see Fig. 3, A and B), a significant amount of GFP protein (∼20–30%) was detected by flow cytometry. This could be explained by the substantially long half-life of the GFP protein. Efficient Depletion of Retrovirus-induced GATA3 Expression by Ad-Cre Infection in in Vitro Differentiated Th2 Cells—To investigate the role of GATA3 in the maintenance of the Th2 phenotype, CD4 T cells from STAT6-deficient CAR Tg mice cultured under Th1-skewed conditions were infected with retroviral vectors containing a lox-P-flanked GATA3/IRES/GFP cassette (pMx-loxP-GATA3-IRES-GFP-loxP). In the STAT6-deficient T cells cultured under Th1-skewed conditions, endogenous GATA3 induction was minimum. The outline of the protocol is shown in Fig. 4A. Four days after infection of the retrovirus vector, the cells were stimulated with immobilized anti-TCR and anti-CD28 mAb, stained with anti-IL-4-PE detection mAbs, and GFP+IL-4+ cells were sorted. Representative GFP/IL-4 profiles are shown in Fig. 4B. The sorted cells were cultured for 6 days in the presence of cytokines (IL-2 and IL-12), and another cycle of stimulation with anti-TCR and anti-CD28 was performed on day 12. Two days later, the cells were infected with Ad-Cre (3 × 108 IFU). Four days after Ad-Cre infection, GFP– cells were sorted to enrich for GATA3 transgene-depleted cells. Th1-skewed conditions were used throughout the 25-day culture. The cultured cells were harvested, and the expression levels of EGFP and GATA3 were assessed to confirm that GATA3 protein is depleted (Fig. 4, C and D). As can be seen, the levels of GFP fluorescence were reduced (Fig. 4C), and the expression levels of GATA3 protein were decreased dramatically (about 10-fold) in the cells infected with Ad-Cre (Fig. 4D). Without Ad-Cre infection, the expression of GATA3 protein was not changed during the last 7-day cultivation (data not shown). The mRNA levels of several transcriptional regulators (GATA3, c-Maf, JunB, and T-bet) in the Th2 cells after ablation of GATA3 were assessed (Fig. 4E). As expected, the mRNA levels of GATA3 were ∼1/10 of those of LacZ-infected control cells. In contrast, essentially no significant change in c-Maf or JunB expression was detected in the Ad-Cre-infected T cells. The expression of T-bet was reduced by the expression of GATA3, and restored by the depletion of GATA3 transgene. Expression of GATA3 Is Required for Th2 Cytokine Production in in Vitro Differentiated Th2 Cells—Cytokine production profiles of the cells prepared in Fig. 4 were assessed by cytoplasmic staining. As can be seen in Fig. 5A, middle panels, more than 40% (39.3 + 3.5%) of the cells infected with pMx-loxP-GATA3-IRES-GFP-loxP were IL-4 producing cells, and more than 30% (19.2 + 18.2%) were IL-5 producing cells. Marginal numbers of IFN-γ producing IL-4 non-producing cells were detected (7.0%). The percentages of IL-4 producing cells were decreased to about 25% (23.1 + 3.8%) after Ad-Cre infection, and those of IL-5 were about 16% (8.1 + 7.9%) (compare the percentages depicted in the middle and right panels in IFN-γ/IL-4 and IL-5/IL-4 profiles). A significant number of IFN-γ producing cells was noted, suggesting that some of the cells become IFN-γ producing cells after depletion of the GATA3 transgene. These results suggest that GATA3 expression is important for the maintenance of Th2 cytokine production. Next, the levels of Th2 cytokines produced in the culture supernatant were determined by ELISA. Little in the way of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5) were detected in supernatants from non-infected cells cultured under Th1-skewed conditions. In contrast, GATA3-transduced cells produced large amounts of Th2 cytokines and decreased amounts of Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-2) as previously reported (16Zhang D.H. Cohn L. Ray P. Bottomly K.

As expected, the production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5) was significantly decreased by Ad-Cre infection (Fig. 5B, bottom). IFN-γ production was moderately restored. These results suggest that the continuous expression of GATA3 is important for the production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in the in vitro differentiated Th2 cells. GATA3 Is Required for the Maintenance of Hyperacetylation of Histone H3 in the IL-5 Gene Locus but Not in the IL-13/IL-4 Gene Loci—Finally, we assessed the chromatin remodeling status of the Th2 cytokine gene loci after deletion of the GATA3 transgene.

Control and “in-patch” measurements documented a greater than fourfold enhancement of carbon biomass in the iron-amended waters. Carbon export through 100 m increased two- to sixfold as the patch subducted below a front. The molar ratio of iron added to carbon exported ranged between 10 4 and 10 5 . The biomass buildup and export were much higher than expected for iron-amended low-silicate waters.
https://openalex.org/W2034007475,"Ras farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) exhibit antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects through a mechanism that is poorly understood. Because of the known role of Ras in the activation of transcription factor NF-κB and because NF-κB-regulated genes can control cell survival and angiogenesis, we postulated that FTI mediates its effects in part by modulating NF-κB activation. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the effect of FTI, SCH 66336, on NF-κB and NF-κB-regulated gene expression activated by a variety of inflammatory and carcinogenic agents. We demonstrate by DNA-binding assay that NF-κB activation induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, cigarette smoke, okadaic acid, and H2O2 was completely suppressed by SCH 66336; the suppression was not cell type-specific. This FTI suppressed the activation of IκBα kinase (IKK), thus abrogating the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. Additionally, TNF-activated Ras and SCH 66336 inhibited the activation. Also, overexpression of Ras (V12) enhanced TNF-induced NF-κB activation, and adenoviral dominant-negative Ras (N17) suppressed the activation, thus suggesting the critical role of Ras in TNF signaling. SCH 66336 also inhibited the NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression activated by TNF, TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, and IKK but not that activated by the p65 subunit of NF-κB. The TNF-induced NF-κB-regulated gene products cyclin D1, COX-2, MMP-9, survivin, IAP1, IAP2, XIAP, Bcl-2, Bfl-1/A1, TRAF1, and FLIP were all down-regulated by SCH 66336, which potentiated apoptosis induced by TNF and doxorubicin. Overall, our results indicate that SCH 66336 inhibited activation of NF-κB and NF-κB-regulated gene expressions induced by carcinogens and inflammatory stimuli, which may provide a molecular basis for the ability of SCH 66336 to suppress proliferation and angiogenesis."

The model programmed in MATLAB was used for global fitting of the kinetics, yielding values for the rate of unwinding, processivity, cooperativity, step size, and occlusion site. The results indicate that a single hepatitis C virus helicase molecule unwinds DNA with a low processivity.

We wish to make a clarification that this method was developed independently in our laboratory but was first described in Lucius et al. (Lucius, A. L., Vindigni, A., Gregorian, R., Ali, J. A., Taylor, A. F., Smith, G. R., and Lohman, T. M. (2002) J. Mol. Biol.324, 409–428 and Lucius, A. L., Maluf, N. K., Fischer, C. J., and Lohman, T. M. (2003) Biophys. J.85, 2224–2239).

Full-Text PDF Open Access Helicases are motor proteins that translocate along DNA or RNA using ATP hydrolysis. The translocation activity is required for strand separation of the duplex nucleic acids, the elimination of secondary structure in RNA, and to dissociate proteins bound to the nucleic acids (1Patel S.S.

The exact mechanism of translocation and nucleic acid strand separation is not known for any helicase. However, unwinding is believed to be a stepwise process that among other things may require interaction between helicase molecules. In this paper we use single turnover unwinding kinetics experiments as well as numerical modeling to investigate the role of subunit interactions during unwinding by the helicase from hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 1The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; MOPS, 3[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid; NS3h, helicase domain of HCV non-structural protein 3; NC, nitrocellulose; nt, nucleotide(s); TLC, thin layer chromatography; NS protein, nonstructural protein; EM, electron microscopy. contains a single stranded RNA genome that codes for a polyprotein, which is cleaved into structural and nonstructural (NS) proteins. The NS3 protein of the HCV is both a helicase and a protease. The crystal structure of NS3 shows two loosely connected domains (5Yao N. Reichert P. Taremi S.S. Prosise W.W. Weber P.C. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1353-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The helicase activity resides on the C-terminal domain that constitutes ∼450 C-terminal amino acid residues and the protease activity on the N-terminal domain. The NS3 protease is tightly associated with its essential co-factor NS4A, which is predicted to be membrane-bound. The NS3 helicase is, therefore, tethered to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in vivo. The protease and helicase activities appear to be independent as these domains can be expressed separately in Escherichia coli while retaining their full activity (6Gwack Y. Kim D.W. Han J.H. Choe J.

Interestingly, NS3 helicase acts both on RNA and DNA and unwinds DNA better than RNA (10Pang P.S. Jankowsky E. Planet P.J. Pyle A.M.

The virus requires both helicase and protease functions, but it is not clear if the protease-NS4A activates or inhibits the helicase. We have previously (17Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31839-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) characterized the helicase activity of NS3h under multiple turnover conditions using a partially duplex DNA substrate that contained a 10-nt-long ssDNA tail and a 33-bp-long duplex. Under multiple turnover conditions, the helicase rate depended on the NS3h concentration, indicating that the observed rate of unwinding is limited by the rebinding of free NS3h to DNA. We also observed that the unwinding rate decreased sharply upon the addition of small amounts of an ATPase-deficient NS3h mutant, but the amplitude of unwinding changed little. This led us to conclude that many NS3h molecules participate in the unwinding of each DNA substrate. It is not clear, however, whether a single molecule of the HCV helicase can unwind DNA and, in cases where multiple helicase molecules are required, whether they work cooperatively. This question is relevant to other helicases as well. For the HCV helicase, most of the evidence thus far indicates that it does not form a stable oligomer in solution. Gel filtration chromatography, ultra centrifugation and x-ray crystallography show that NS3h is a monomer (17Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol.

Protein-protein cross-linking of NS3h occurs inefficiently, and the addition of an ATPase-deficient mutant to wild type NS3h does not inhibit its ATPase activity (17Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31839-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that the NS3h ATPase activity is independent of NS3h concentration when measured in the presence of a non-ionic detergent (17Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31839-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fluorimetric titration experiments failed to show NS3h cooperativity in ssDNA binding (20Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29377-29385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Yet paradoxically it appears that multiple HCV helicase molecules are necessary for efficient DNA unwinding. Classes of helicases show varying levels of intersubunit interactions. For ring helicases, the assembly into a stable cooperative hexamer ring is necessary for activity (1Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 21Kato M. Frick D.N. Lee J. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. J. Biol.

Whether non-ring helicases function as monomers or cooperatively as oligomers is an active area of research. Cooperative behavior in helicases can be manifested as coordination in ATPase, nucleic acid binding, or translocation activities. Such cooperativity arises from physical interaction between the helicase molecules, and it is characterized by a certain free energy of binding. However, a different type of cooperative behavior that does not require protein-protein interactions arises from the mere presence of multiple helicase molecules on the same nucleic acid substrate. The superfamily 1 helicases Rep and UvrD helicases from E. coli have been proposed to function as dimers (22Cheng W. Hsieh J. Brendza K.M. Lohman T.M. J. Mol.

We have characterized the interactions of HCV helicase with DNA substrates of varying ssDNA tail lengths to determine the number of NS3h molecules bound to a helicase substrate. To determine the degree of cooperativity of N53, a superfamily 2 helicase, we measured the unwinding of DNAs containing increasing lengths of the ssDNA tail. We found that multiple helicase molecules are necessary for efficient DNA unwinding. The increase in activity with increasing tail length can be explained by a functional interaction model of unwinding. In this paper we present a way to simulate and fit the helicase unwinding experimental data. We have made this model general by including features that can be applicable to all helicases and used to determine the helicase parameters such as cooperativity in helicase action, processivity of unwinding, stepping rate, and the kinetic step size. The helicase domain of HCV NS3 protein with a C-terminal His tag (NS3h) was expressed in E. coli carrying a plasmid pET21b-NS3HCV (12Kim D.W. Gwack Y. Han J.H. Choe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). NS3h protein was purified, stored, and quantitated as described previously (17Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31839-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The reaction buffer contained 50 mm MOPS·NaOH, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dl-dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.0. Experiments were performed at 22 °C unless specified otherwise. PolyU, average length of 210 nucleotides, was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and polyoxyethelenesorbitanmonolaurate (Tween 20), purchased from Sigma, was purified by passing through charcoal. DNA Substrates—The sequences of the oligodeoxynucleotides shown in Table I were produced using a random number algorithm and checked for lack of stable secondary structure with the Oligo Analyzer (www.idtdna.com). The oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and purified by PAGE in 7 m urea, 60 °C. The concentration of DNA was determined spectrophotometrically in 8 m urea using extinction coefficients of the individual bases. The dsDNA substrates were annealed by heating to 95 °C followed by gradual cooling. The completeness of annealing was checked by native PAGE.Table IDNA substrates Open table in a new tab Electron Microscopy—200 nm NS3h protein was mixed with 50 nm 66 bp-25 DNA substrate (see Table I) and cross-linked with 0.1% glutaraldehyde. The cross-linked complexes were purified on a column packed with A5M gel filtration resin (Bio-Rad) and adsorbed on a glow-charged carbon-coated copper grid. The adsorbed complexes were dehydrated by washing with increasing concentrations of ethanol in water, dried, and rotary shadow-cast with tungsten. The samples were examined and photographed using a Philips 420 electron microscope under 50,000× magnification. Fluorimetric Titration—Fluorimetric titration was performed as described previously (20Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29377-29385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of DNA solution were added to the solution of NS3h protein and allowed to mix before measuring its absorbance at 280 nm and fluorescence after excitation at 280 nm at an emission wavelength of 340 nm. Values of fluorescence were corrected for dilution and inner filter effect and plotted against [DNA], and the [DNA]-dependent fluorescence change was fit to Equation 1, F=fE×(Et−Eb)+fEb×Eb (Eq. 1) where F is the observed fluorescence, fE is the fluorescence coefficient of free NS3h, fEb is the fluorescence coefficient of NS3h bound to DNA, Et is total NS3h concentration, and Eb is concentration of NS3h bound to DNA, and Equation 2, Â Eb=Kd+Et+DtÃ—nâˆ’(Kd+Et+DtÃ—n)2âˆ’4Ã—EtÃ—DtÃ—n2Â(Eq. 2) where Dt is total DNA concentration, Kd is the dissociation constant, and n is the number of NS3h molecules per DNA. Helicase Assay—The kinetics of dsDNA unwinding was measured using RQF-3 Quench-Flow apparatus (KinTek Instruments, Austin, TX). NS3h (0.5 μm) was mixed with 2 nm ss/dsDNA substrate with radiolabeled shorter strand, incubated for 10 s, and mixed with 5 mm ATP and 0.5 μm polyU for 0.1–65 s (concentrations are given for the state after the second mixing). The unwinding reaction was stopped by ejecting the mixture into a test tube containing 100 mm EDTA, 3% SDS, 15% Ficoll, and 0.1% of bromphenol blue. The intact and unwound DNA substrates were resolved on a native 10 or 13% PAGE, and their radioactivity was measured with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The fraction of unwound substrate was calculated and corrected for the presence of ssDNA at time 0 using Equation 3, F=SS×DS0−SS0×DSDS0×(SS+DS) (Eq. 3) where F is the fraction of unwound substrate, DS and SS are radioactivities of intact and unwound substrate bands at a given time, respectively, and DS0 and SS0 are the radioactivities of intact and unwound substrates at time 0, respectively. Data Analysis—The unwinding time courses were fit to the incomplete gamma function (Equation 4), F=A∫0∞e−xxn−1dx∫0kte−xxn−1dx (Eq. 4) where F is a fraction of unwound DNA substrate molecules, A is the amplitude of unwinding, k is stepping rate, and t is reaction time. The number of steps, n, taken by the helicase to unwind the substrate was calculated as n=Lds−Las (Eq. 5) where Lds is the number of base pairs in the DNA substrate duplex, La is the length of the shortest DNA duplex that can stay together under the experimental conditions, and s is the step size. Software MATLAB with Optimization toolbox (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) was used for all calculations. Electron Microscopy (EM) of NS3h·ss/dsDNA Complexes— EM was used to determine the interactions of NS3h with the ssDNA and duplex DNA regions of the partial duplex helicase substrate. An excess of NS3h was incubated with the 66 bp-25 DNA substrate that has a 25-nt ssDNA tail and a 66-bp duplex (Table I). The complex was immobilized on a carbon grid, tungsten shadow-cast, and visualized by EM. Fig. 1 shows the electron micrograph of the protein-DNA complexes that appear as a ball and a stick. The “stick” part of a complex has a thickness of 0.4 nm, which is typical for dsDNA visualized by tungsten shadow casting. The average length of the stick, 17.3 ± 2 nm, is close to the theoretical length of 66 bp B-DNA (22.4 nm). The ssDNA is not visible by the EM method used; therefore, the “ball” flanking the stick represents ssDNA covered with the NS3h protein. The EM studies show that the complex of multiple NS3h molecules bound to ssDNA is not extended, like e.g. the complex of T7 gp4, RecA, or E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein with ssDNA (30Egelman E.H.

Instead, NS3h-ssDNA complex forms a clump regardless of the length of ssDNA (data not shown). In addition, the micrographs of NS3h-ss·dsDNA complexes show that the NS3h protein binds only to the ssDNA tail of the DNA substrate. Therefore, DNA unwinding does not initiate internally from multiple positions within the dsDNA but must proceed sequentially from the ssDNA tail end. The NS3h Binding to ss/dsDNA Substrates Is Proportional to the ssDNA Tail Length—The stoichiometry and the Kd of the NS3h complex with the ss/ds substrates were measured by fluorimetric titrations. The ss/dsDNA helicase substrates contained a 33-bp duplex region and ssDNA tails ranging in length from 5 to 75 nts (33 bp–5 to 33bp–75 in Table I). The ss/dsDNA helicase substrates were made by annealing synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides. The completeness of annealing was greater than 98% as determined by native PAGE (data not shown). As shown previously, the intrinsic fluorescence of NS3h protein decreases upon binding to ss nucleic acids (33Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To measure DNA binding, the titration experiments were performed by adding increasing amounts of the ss/dsDNA substrate to a constant amount of NS3h while exciting the sample with 280-nm light and measuring the intrinsic NS3h fluorescence at 340 nm. The titration was repeated with DNA substrates of different ssDNA tail lengths. The resulting fluorescence values were corrected for sample dilution and inner filter effect. To determine the number of NS3h proteins bound per ss/dsDNA substrate (n) and the Kd, the fluorimetric data were fit to Equations 1 and 2. The number of NS3hs per ss/dsDNA substrate as a function of the ssDNA tail length is shown in Fig. 2A. The number of NS3h proteins bound per DNA substrate increases linearly as the ssDNA tail length increases with a slope of 0.162 ± 0.01 NS3h molecules/base. This corresponds to the NS3h occlusion site of 6.2 ± 0.4 bases. This value is smaller than the occlusion site obtained from similar experiments with the ssDNA substrates (7.7 ± 1 bases) (20Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29377-29385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As indicated previously (20Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29377-29385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the observed binding behavior of NS3h protein with long ssDNA substrates is a product of binding events to multiple overlapping sites. A slightly higher binding density and a smaller occlusion site can result if NS3h has a higher affinity for binding to the ss/dsDNA junction. The Kd for the 33 bp-10 ss/dsDNA substrate with a 10-nt ssDNA tail is 1.3 ± 0.5 nm (Fig. 2B). This value is consistent with Kd values previously reported for short ssDNA substrates (20Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29377-29385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As in the case of ssDNA substrates, no cooperativity was detected in the binding of NS3h to the ss/dsDNA substrates, and equations describing a simple non-cooperative binding model fit well to the fluorimetric data (Equations 1 and 2). The DNA Unwinding Efficiency of the NS3h Is Dependent on the Duplex as Well as the ssDNA Tail Length—The unwinding kinetics were measured using a rapid quench-flow instrument as shown in Fig. 3A. The helicase and DNA were preincubated for 10 s, and increasing the preincubation time by 3-fold did not change the unwinding kinetics (data not shown). Thus, a functional helicase-DNA complex is formed within 10 s, and lengthy preincubation times were not necessary to observe activity as reported for NS3 by Pang et al. (10Pang P.S. Jankowsky E. Planet P.J. Pyle A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Helicase substrates of different duplex lengths from 18-bp to 40-bp and of varying ssDNA tail length, from 5 to 75 nt were studied. Two kinds of substrates with varying ssDNA tails were used. One set of substrates (18-bp and 33-bp) contained tails of a defined sequence shown in Table I and the second set (18-bp, 33-bp, 40-bp) contained dTn tails. After pre-incubating NS3h with the DNA substrate for 10 s, unwinding was initiated by the addition of ATP and polyU RNA. PolyU was used as a trap to prevent NS3h from re-binding to the unwinding substrate once reaction was initiated. Thus, DNA unwinding was measured under single turnover conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, B–F, the substrates with DNA length >18-bp duplex unwound with a kinetic lag, which indicates that the reaction involves a sequence of transient intermediates before the formation of the final product. The single turn-over kinetics of DNA unwinding by UvrD and recBCD helicases have been described by an equation for a multistep process (stepping equation) (34Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 35Lucius A.L. Maluf N.K. Fischer C.J. Lohman T.M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2224-2239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The stepping equation describes the process of dsDNA unwinding as a sequence of identical steps, although the exact nature of these steps has not been determined for any helicase. The same process can be described by the incomplete gamma function (Equation 4), which is continuous with respect to n, the number of steps required to unwind a particular length of duplex. This property makes the incomplete gamma a more convenient function for curve-fitting. We globally fit the unwinding kinetics of DNA with varying ssDNA tails and duplex lengths to a single kinetic step size and stepping rate (Equations 4 and 5). The resulting fit is shown as the solid lines in Fig. 3, B–F. The global fit provided a kinetic step size of 9.1 (±0.9) bp, stepping rate of 0.3 (±0.02) step/s, and a minimal duplex length of 6.6 (±0.9) bp, which is La, the length of the shortest DNA duplex that can stay together under the experimental conditions. Evidently, the number of NS3h molecules bound to the ssDNA tail does not affect the kinetic step size or the rate of unwinding. This indicates that the number of helicase molecules assembled on the ssDNA tail does not change the mechanism by which unwinding occurs. However, the type of helicase complex assembled on the ssDNA does affect the unwinding efficiency (the amount of DNA unwound in a single turnover). As shown in Fig. 4, the unwinding efficiency increases as the ssDNA tail length increases, and shorter duplexes are unwound more efficiently compared with longer duplexes. The length of the ssDNA tail determines the number of NS3h molecules bound to the ss/dsDNA substrate before unwinding begins. The 18-bp duplex was unwound significantly even from a short 5-base ssDNA tail, but neither 5 nor 10 base tails were sufficient to unwind the 33-bp duplex. In the case of the 33- and 40-bp duplex substrates, the efficiency of unwinding increases gradually with the ssDNA tail length, reaching 33 and 20%, respectively, for the 75-base tail. The results also show that the efficiency of unwinding is not affected by the base composition of the ssDNA tail. The amplitudes of unwinding DNA substrates with a tail containing a defined sequence of all bases versus a dTn tail are similar. Although fitting the unwinding data to the incomplete gamma function provided an estimate of the step size and stepping rate, these parameters do not help us to understand the dependence of the unwinding amplitude on the duplex length and the ssDNA tail length. We have used a C-terminal His-tagged helicase domain protein for our studies that show a DNA unwinding rate of 2.7 bp/s at 22 °C (stepping rate × step size). This rate is comparable or even faster than the reported nucleic acid unwinding rates of either the helicase domain or the full-length protease-helicase with or without the His tag (10Pang P.S.

This dementia is unusual in that the inclusions result from the retention of ordered polymers of neuroserpin, most likely within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of neurons (11Davis R.L. Shrimpton A.E.

Lomas D.A. Nature. 1999; 401: 376-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the number of inclusions is directly related to the molecular instability caused by the mutation and inversely proportional to the age of onset of dementia (13Davis R.L. Shrimpton A.E.

For example, the Syracuse mutation (S49P) causes dementia in middle age, whereas the more severe Portland mutant (S52R) causes more inclusions and an onset of dementia in the early 20s.

We have recently demonstrated that recombinant Syracuse neuroserpin (S49P) forms polymers 13-fold faster than wild type neuroserpin in vitro (4Belorgey D. Crowther D.C. Mahadeva R. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17367-17373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but little is known about other neuroserpin mutants. The polymers that form in FENIB are identical to those that are formed by a mutant of another member of the serpin superfamily, the Z variant of α1-antitrypsin, in the ER of hepatocytes in association with liver disease (14Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). This common mechanism of disease has allowed us to group these conditions and others that result from polymerization of serpin mutants, angio-edema (C1-inhibitor), thrombosis (antithrombin), and emphysema (α1-antichymotrypsin), as serpinopathies (18Lomas D.A. Mahadeva R. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 19Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. New. Engl. J.

The serpinopathies can be classified as “conformational diseases” that arise when proteins undergo self-association and tissue deposition (21Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Serpinopathies differ from other conformational diseases in that the accumulated proteins are contained within the ER (22Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar), which also qualifies the serpinopathies as “ER storage diseases” (23Rutishauser J. Spiess M. Swiss Med. Wkly. 2002; 132: 211-222PubMed Google Scholar). It remains unclear how the ER handles ordered serpin polymers that, in contrast to non-polymerogenic mutant secretory proteins, seem not to elicit the unfolded protein response (24Graham K.S. Le A. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20463-20468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although we mechanistically understand the biochemical abnormality that underlies the polymerization of neuroserpin, there is no information on the synthesis, transport, or degradation of either the wild type or the mutant proteins. The point at which mutant neuroserpin is retained within neurons in individuals with FENIB has been deduced from microscopic analysis of intracerebral inclusions rather than from direct studies of trafficking of the wild type or the mutant protein (12Davis R.L.

Our data show that both mutations cause the retention of neuroserpin as polymers within the ER and that mutant and wild type neuroserpin are only partially degraded by proteasomes.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17367-17373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), including the secretion signal peptide, were cloned into the pTRE2-hyg vector from Clontech (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK; pTRE2-hyg is part of the TetOn/TetOff system, but leaky expression from the tetracycline-sensitive promoter allows the use of this vector in COS-7 cells in the absence of the transactivator component of the system) using the BamHI and ClaI sites. The Portland mutation (S52R) was introduced into the wild type plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNAs for wild type and both mutant neuroserpins contained in the expression plasmids were fully sequenced to ensure that there were no PCR errors. Cell Cultures and DNA Transfections—COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 10% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Transfections were performed in 6-well plates that had been precoated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine. Typically, 4 μg of plasmid DNA were introduced into each well mixed with 12.5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-free Opti-MEM culture medium (Invitrogen) following the protocol recommended by Invitrogen. For the co-expression experiments, the cells were transfected in the same way with a mix of 2 μg of wild type neuroserpin plus 2 μg of Syracuse or Portland neuroserpin, and parallel control cells were transfected with 2 μg of either wild type, Syracuse, or Portland neuroserpin alone. Immunocytochemistry for Fluorescence and Confocal Microscopy— Cells for immunocytochemical staining were grown on coverslips pretreated with poly-l-lysine and transfected as described above. At 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection, cells were washed, fixed in ice-cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed again, and blocked for 60 min with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide, and then incubated in primary antibody for 90 min. Cells were washed again, incubated with the secondary antibody for 60 min, washed, and mounted in Fluorosave (Calbiochem, through CN Biosciences, Nottingham, UK) containing 2% (w/v) 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane (Sigma) and 3 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Cells for confocal microscopy were stained with anti-neuroserpin antibody and its secondary antibody and then with either anti-calreticulin or anti-GM130 and their respective secondary antibodies following the same protocol. All washes were performed in triplicate using PBS, and all antibodies were diluted in the blocking reagent and incubated at room temperature. The anti-neuroserpin antiserum was diluted at 1:1000; anti-calreticulin and anti-GM130 were used at 1 ng/μl; and donkey secondary anti-rabbit IgG (Texas Red), anti-goat IgG (fluorescein isothiocyanate), and anti-mouse IgG (fluorescein isothiocyanate) antibodies were used at 1.3 ng/μl. SDS and Nondenaturing PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—The cell pellet from each well of 6-well plates was lysed in 20 μl of Nonidet lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40), and 2 ml of culture medium from each well were concentrated 10 times in Vivaspin 2-ml concentrators with a 3000-Da cut-off membrane (Viva-science AG, Hannover, Germany). Samples of 20 μl were mixed with 2× loading buffer containing 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and 4% (w/v) SDS and analyzed by 8% (w/v) acrylamide SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205511) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing PAGE was performed on 7.5% (w/v) acrylamide nondenaturing gels using 2× loading buffer without SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were transferred from the gels onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) at 200 mA for 2 h for Western blot analysis. 20% (v/v) methanol was added to the transfer buffer for gels that had been run in SDS. After transfer, the membrane was washed in PBT (PBS plus 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and blocked overnight in PBT plus 5% (w/v) dried skimmed milk powder. The following day, the membrane was incubated with anti-neuroserpin antibody diluted 1:25,000 in PBT-milk for 105 min, washed six times for 5 min with PBT, and then incubated with 1:100,000 anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibody in PBT-milk for 105 min. The membrane was washed a further six times for 5 min with PBT and 15 min in PBS before developing using the ECL SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) and exposed to film. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—One day after transfection, cells were starved in 1 ml of methionine and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h, pulsed for 15 min with 1 MBq/well Redivue Promix (Amersham Biosciences) containing 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine, and then harvested or washed with cold PBS and cultured in 1 ml of chase medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 200 mm methionine and 200 mm cysteine) for 3 or 6 h. For the pulse-chase time course, the cells were chased for 0, 1, 3, 6, and 15 h in the same chase medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. For the protein degradation experiments, the cells were treated with 25 μm lactacystin (an irreversible proteasome inhibitor) or 200 μm leupeptin (a reversible inhibitor of trypsin-like and cysteine proteases) purchased from Calbiochem (through CN Biosciences, Nottingham, UK). The inhibitors were added to the cultures 1 h prior to starvation and kept in all subsequent steps until harvesting. After the chase period, the culture medium was collected and centrifuged at 2000 rpm and 4 °C for 5 min, and the cells were harvested by adding 0.5 ml/well Nonidet lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science)) plus 15 μm pepstatin A (Calbiochem, through CN Biosciences, Nottingham, UK), scraping and vortexing gently for 3 s, and then centrifuging at 16,000 rpm and 4 °C for 15 min. Samples of 2 μl from each supernatant were used for trichloroacetic acid precipitation and scintillation counting of total incorporated radioactivity. The supernatants from culture medium and cell lysate samples were precleared with rabbit IgG bound to 45 μl of 50% (v/v) Protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C, and then neuroserpin, cyclin B1, or cathepsin D were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with their specific antibodies prebound to Protein A-Sepharose (45 μl of 50% (v/v) Protein A-Sepharose plus 1 μg of purified antibody at 4 °C for 2 h). The following day, immunocomplexes were washed four times with cold washing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and once with cold PBS. For endoglycosidase H treatment, the immunocomplexes were resuspended in 60 μl of digestion buffer (100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 1% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C, and 10 μl of endoglycosidase H at 1 milliunit/μland1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (both from Sigma) were added to the mixture and then incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Radiolabeled proteins were recovered in SDS-PAGE loading buffer by heating for 5 min at 90 °C, separated on 8% (w/v) acrylamide gels, and detected by autoradiography with a Cyclone phosphor imager (Packard Instrument Co.). Mutant Syracuse and Portland Neuroserpin Accumulate within Transiently Transfected COS-7 Cells—In order to establish a cellular model for FENIB, we cloned human wild type neuroserpin and the neuroserpin mutants Syracuse and Portland into the mammalian expression vector pTRE2-hyg. These plasmid DNAs were used for transient transfection of COS-7 cells, with an estimated transfection efficiency of 30–40%. Expression of wild type, Syracuse, and Portland neuroserpin was detected by immunocytochemistry with an anti-neuroserpin polyclonal antibody. All three forms of neuroserpin produced a reticular staining pattern 12 h after transfection in keeping with protein localization within the ER (Fig. 1, a–c and m), and wild type neuroserpin often also showed an additional and stronger perinuclear staining compatible with its presence in the Golgi complex (Fig. 1a). After 24 h, the signal was stronger, and neuroserpin could be clearly detected as punctate accumulations in cells transfected with either Syracuse or Portland, but not wild type, neuroserpin (Fig. 1, d–f and m). In the case of Portland neuroserpin, the level of accumulation after 24 h was already significantly greater than for wild type neuroserpin. The accumulation increased for both mutants after 48 and 72 h of culture (Fig. 1, h, i, k, l, and m) such that 70–90% of transfected cells contained retained neuroserpin. In comparison, wild type neuroserpin still gave the same ER staining pattern (Fig. 1, g, j, and m). The intensity of staining of wild type neuroserpin decreased after 72 h of culture, suggesting that a significant amount of the protein had been secreted. Syracuse and Portland Neuroserpin Are Secreted More Slowly than the Wild Type Protein—Neuroserpin is a secreted glycoprotein. During biosynthesis, neuroserpin is translocated into the ER, where its signal peptide is cleaved and the protein moiety is N-glycosylated. Human neuroserpin has three potential N-glycosylation sites within its amino acid sequence (26Schrimpf S.P. Bleiker A.J. Brecevic L. Kozlov S.V. Berger P. Osterwalder T. Krueger S.R. Schinzel A. Sonderegger P. Genomics. 1997; 40: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Core glycans are trimmed and further processed in the Golgi complex, resulting in a further increase in molecular mass. The predicted molecular mass of nonglycosylated neuroserpin is ∼45 kDa, close to the size of the recombinant neuroserpin purified from Escherichia coli used in this study as a control. The addition and processing of N-linked glycans along the secretory pathway gradually increases the molecular mass of neuroserpin to 55 kDa (fully processed secreted form). The secretion of wild type, Syracuse, and Portland neuroserpin was assessed in our cell system by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection (Fig. 2, Wt, Sy, and Po). After 12 h, there were insufficient quantities of neuroserpin secreted by any of the transfected cells to be detected by Western blot analysis, although we could easily detect 20 ng of recombinant purified neuroserpin in the control lane (Fig. 2, NS). After 24 h, wild type and both neuroserpin mutants were clearly detected in the cell lysates as bands of 50 kDa (relative to the size of control neuroserpin), but only the wild type neuroserpin monomer was present in the medium of transfected cells as a single band of 55 kDa, corresponding to mature neuroserpin with fully processed N-linked glycans. In some transfections, a faint band of mature neuroserpin was also detectable in the Syracuse and Portland culture media at this time point (data not shown). After 48 h, the intracellular band for wild type neuroserpin was clearly weaker than the intracellular fractions for the mutants, and we could detect the secretion of Syracuse and Portland neuroserpin into the culture media as faint bands, in contrast to the strong signal for secreted wild type neuroserpin. By 72 h, there was almost no wild type neuroserpin left inside the cells, whereas both neuroserpin mutants still showed a clear signal inside the cells, and a strong presence of all three neuroserpin forms could be detected in the culture media. All of the patients with FENIB so far identified are heterozygous for a neuroserpin mutation (13Davis R.L. Shrimpton A.E. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Gerhard L. Baumann B. Lawrence D.A. Yepes M. Kim T.S. Ghetti B. Piccardo P. Takao M. Lacbawan L. Muenke M. Sifers R.N. Bradshaw C.B. Kent P.F. Collins G.H. Larocca D. Holohan P.D. Lancet. 2002; 359: 2242-2247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, wild type neuroserpin is co-expressed with the mutant allele that causes the disease. We therefore assessed the effect of heterozygous co-expression on the secretion of neuroserpin in our COS-7 model by co-transfecting the cells with a 1:1 mix of plasmids encoding either wild type and Syracuse neuroserpin or wild type and Portland neuroserpin. The results were very similar for both co-expression combinations (Fig. 2, Wt+Sy and Wt+Po). The bands for intracellular neuroserpin in co-expressing cells were always stronger than the intracellular signal from cells expressing an equivalent dose of wild type neuroserpin alone. This was particularly striking at the 24-h time point, when cells transfected with 2 μg of wild type neuroserpin DNA showed only a very faint intracellular band, whereas cells co-transfected with 2 μg of wild type plus 2 μg of mutant neuroserpin showed a strong intracellular signal. In the culture medium of cells co-expressing wild type and mutant neuroserpin, the neuroserpin band was clearly detectable after 24 h, at which point it was still difficult to detect a signal in the medium of cells transfected with 2 μgof either Syracuse or Portland neuroserpin alone (data not shown). After 48 and 72 h, more neuroserpin had been secreted into the medium of cells co-expressing wild type and mutant neuroserpin than in the medium of cells expressing only Syracuse or Portland neuroserpin. We next studied the secretion of wild type and mutant neuroserpin in more detail by pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 3, a and b), transfecting the cells with wild type, Syracuse, or Portland neuroserpin alone or co-transfecting them with wild type plus Syracuse or wild type plus Portland neuroserpin. After a 15-min pulse with [35S]methionine/cysteine, an anti-neuroserpin antibody immunoprecipitated the same three bands from all of the cell lysates (Fig. 3a, chase 0 h). These bands had molecular masses ranging between 45 and 50 kDa and most likely represent singly, doubly, and triply N-glycosylated forms of neuroserpin within the ER, with the largest of the three being the most abundant species. In the successive chase time points at 1, 3, 6, and 15 h after the end of the pulse, immunoprecipitation analysis of the cell lysates showed mainly the same 50-kDa intracellular band for all transfected cells, although its intensity varied depending on the neuroserpin transfection and the chase time. In the case of the cells transfected with mutant neuroserpin alone, a faint and slightly higher molecular weight band could be consistently detected in the cell lysates (most clearly after 1 h of chase), probably corresponding to mutant neuroserpin contained in the Golgi complex. The analysis of the culture media showed a 55-kDa band that corresponded to neuroserpin with Golgi-processed N-glycan chains, which also changed in intensity depending on the DNA transfected and the chase time. In contrast to the Western blot analysis (Fig. 2),"

We have reported that NF-κB is essential but not sufficient for the synergistic induction of MnSOD by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and cytokines. To further identify transcription factors and co-activators that participate in the induction of MnSOD, we used NF-κB affinity chromatography to isolate potential NF-κB interacting proteins. Proteins eluted from the NF-κB affinity column were subjected to proteomic analysis and verified by Western analysis. Nucleophosmin (NPM), a nucleolar phosphoprotein, is the most abundant single protein identified. Co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest a physical interaction between NPM and NF-κB proteins. To verify the role of NPM on MnSOD gene transcription, cells were transfected with constructs expressing NPM in sense or antisense orientation as well as interference RNA. The results indicate that an increase NPM expression leads to increased MnSOD gene transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with this, expression of small interfering RNA for NPM leads to inhibition of MnSOD gene transcription but does not have any effect on the expression of interleukin-8, suggesting that the effect of NPM is selective. These results identify NPM as a partner of the NF-κB transcription complex in the induction of MnSOD by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and cytokines.

The critical role of MnSOD as a cytoprotective enzyme is illustrated in both MnSOD knockout and transgenic animal models. For instance, MnSOD knockout mice develop cardiomyopathy and die within 10 days after birth (13Li Y. Huang T.T. Carison E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C.

Conversely, transgenic mice overexpressing human MnSOD experienced less toxic injury resulting from inflammation (15Wispe J.R. Warner B.B. Clark J.C. Dey C.R. Neuman J. Glasser S.W. Crapo J.D.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5265-5271PubMed Google Scholar). The human MnSOD (SOD2) gene is a single-copy gene consisting of five exons interrupted by four introns with a typical splice junction (23Wan X.S. Devalaraja M.N. St. Clair D.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The SOD2 gene from human, bovine, rat, and mouse share more than 90% homology in the coding sequence; the 5′-flanking regions are less homologous between human and other species (24Meyrick B. Magnuson M.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions reveal multiple potential regulatory motifs for NF-κB, AP-1, AP-2, and Sp1 bindings. The 5′ proximal promoter in the SOD2 gene is characterized by a lack of TATA or CAAT box, but it is rich in GC boxes. The basal promoter of the SOD2 gene has multiple transcription factor binding motifs containing Sp1 and AP-2 binding sites. Functional studies in different cell lines with different levels of Sp1 protein suggest that cellular levels of this protein might be differentially regulated via GC binding motifs in the human MnSOD promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis of Sp1 and AP-2 binding sites shows that Sp1 is essential for transcription of the SOD2 gene, whereas AP-2 plays a negative role on transcription. AP-2 down-regulates the transcription of MnSOD through interaction with Sp1 in the promoter region (25Zhu C.-H. Huang Y. Oberley L.W. Domann F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14407-14413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Zhu C. Huang Y. Weydert C.J. Oberley L.W. Domann F.E. Antioxid.

The binding of Sp1 and AP-2 proteins to their recognition sites generates a specific DNA looping structure required for cooperative activation of other regulatory proteins and recruitment of co-activators of the MnSOD gene (28Mastrangelo I.A.

In addition to Sp1 and AP-2, the basal promoter also contains binding sites for transcription modulators including the early growth protein, Egr-1. Interestingly, Egr-1 appears to play a negative role on basal promoter activity without affecting the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-mediated activation of the human MnSOD promoter (29Porntadavity S. Xu Y. Kiningham K.K. Rangnekar V.M. Prachayasitikul V. St. Clair D.K. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The SOD2 gene of mice and humans contains enhancer elements in the second intron of the gene (30Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell.

DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Functional analyses of enhancer elements demonstrate that the intronic element consists of binding motifs for NF-κB, C/EBP, and NF-1, which are responsive to TNF-α and IL-1β. The activation of NF-κB is essential but not sufficient for the induction of MnSOD by TNF-α and IL-1β (32St. Clair D.K. Porntadavity S. Xu Y. Kiningham K.K. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). NF-κB forms various homo- and heterodimer units among the mammalian subunits of p50, p52, p65 (Rel A), c-Rel, and Rel B. These dimer units in turn bind to a group of NF-κB DNA binding sites with different affinities within the target gene (33Grilli M. Chiu J.J. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev.

The role of Sp1 on NF-κB-mediated induction of the SOD2 gene is unclear. Whereas it has been shown that Sp1 interferes with the DNA binding sites of NF-κB (35Hirano F. Tanaka H. Hirano Y. Hiramoto M. Hanada H. Makino I. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), other studies demonstrate that Sp1 bound to distal enhancer regions can interact with Sp1 bound at sites proximal to the promoter and synergistically activates transcription (36Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Mastrangelo et al. (28Mastrangelo I.A. Courey A.J. Wall J.S. Jackson S.P. Hough P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5670-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) have shown that this synergism is likely a direct consequence of interactions between the distal and proximal Sp1 protein through a loop formation. Loop formation may lead to increased concentration of the activator protein. Such double stem-loop structures favor activation of some specific proteins (such as RNA binding proteins) to bind with the loop structure. An important RNA-binding protein, nucleophosmin (NPM) is ubiquitously expressed and continuously shuttled between nucleus and cytoplasm. It was originally identified as functioning in the assembly and transport of ribosome. Recently, expression of NPM has been implicated in modulating active cellular processes such as transcription, DNA replication, and apoptosis (37Carrier F. Gatignol A. Hollander M.C. Jeang K.T. Fornace Jr., A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1544-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Nucleophosmin can relieve the transcription response of several mammalian genes by the transcription factor YY1 (38Inouye C.J. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6506-6510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relief of YY1-induced transcriptional repression is achieved by its ability to interact with the YY1 protein. It has been shown that NPM regulates the stability of the transcriptional activity of p53 (39Colombo E. Marine J.C. Danovi D. Fulini B. Pelicci P.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NPM rapidly up-regulates and has been considered to be an immediate early response gene induced by damaged DNA. Interestingly, expression of nucleophosmin is increased in human myometrium during labor (40Chan E.C. Fraser S. Yin S. Yeo G. Kwek K. Fairclough R.J. Smith R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The increase in NPM levels is associated with an increase in MnSOD levels during labor, suggesting a link between NPM and MnSOD expression. However, it is not known whether and how the expression of nucleophosmin affects the expression of MnSOD. In this study, we use proteomic, immunoprecipitation, site-directed mutagenesis, gene transfection, and gene knock-down approaches to demonstrate that NPM enhances MnSOD transcription by interacting with NF-κB. The results identify NPM as an NF-κB co-activator that regulates the expression of MnSOD by interacting with NF-κB in response to PMA and cytokine treatment. It is possible that NPM may be a key factor that enables the induction of the housekeeping gene. Cell Culture—The human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C in media consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Inc., Logan, UT), 1% (w/v) l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 1% PSN antibiotic (Invitrogen), and 1 mg/ml insulin (Invitrogen) as a growth factor. Reagents—Unless otherwise stated, all antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody and anti-NPM-V5-epitope antibodies were purchased from Sigma and Invitrogen, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal MnSOD antibody and GAPDH antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies (Lake Placid, NY). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. Construction of Plasmid—A BamHI fragment (B7) containing a 3.4-kb 5′-flanking region was used to generate the –555 to +24 basal MnSOD promoter by polymerase chain reaction. To create this construct, PCR primers with recognition sequences KpnI (upstream) and BglII (downstream) restriction sites were added for subcloning at the upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. To generate the intronic fragment (I2E) (1742 to 2083) constructs, a BamHI-digested 39b λ phase DNA, containing the entire human MnSOD gene (8074 bp), was used as the template for PCR amplification with a primer having a BglII artificial restriction site. The PCR product was then ligated to the BglII site of the –555 to +24 basal promoter containing pGL3 vector, which yielded the natural orientation of the gene. The following primer sets were used to generate the aforementioned constructs (the underlined sequences are the artificial KpnI and BglII recognition sites in the forward and reverse strand primers, respectively, or the BglII recognition site in both forward and reverse strands): forward primer (–555), 5′-CGGGGTACCCGCTGGCTCTACCCTCAGCTCATA-3′; reverse primer (+24), 5′-GGAAGATCTGCCGAAGCCACCACAGCCACGAGT-3′; forward primer (+1742), 5′-GGAAGATCTCGGGGTTATGAAATTTGTTGAGTA-3′; reverse primer (+2083), 5′-GGAAGATCTCCACAAGTAAAGGACTGAAATTAA-3′. After amplification of the human MnSOD basal promoter (–555 to +24), the system was subcloned into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) containing the luciferase gene. PCR amplified I2E fragments were directly subcloned downstream of the human MnSOD basal promoter. Site-specific mutations on the NF-κB binding region in the I2E construct were prepared by the Chameleon™ double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as previously reported (31Xu Y. Kiningham K.K. Devalaraja M.N. Yeh C.-C. Majima H. Kasarskis E.J. St. Clair D.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). pcDNA3.1/NPM(B23), a cDNA clone, is a ras-gene™-constructed NPM expression vector obtained from Invitrogen. The presence of a cDNA insert within the vector was confirmed by restriction digestion. For construction of antisense NPM, pcDNA3.1/NPM plasmid DNA was used as the PCR template and primer with HindIII and BglII artificial restriction sites (underlined sequences) in the forward and reverse strand primers, respectively, and were used as follows: forward primer, 5′-TCAAAGCTTTCACGGTTGTGAACTAAAGGCCGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ATCGGAAGATCTTTACCTTCGAATGGGTGACCT-3′. After amplification, the PCR product was subcloned into the pCMV vector at the multicloning site in the antisense orientation. The nucleotide sequence and orientations of all constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, insulin, and PSN antibiotics. 70–80% confluent cells were achieved within 24 h by plating the cells at a density of 2 × 106 in a 100 × 20-mm cell culture dish. The cells were then transfected with plasmids following a modified calcium phosphate method as described previously (41Kiningham K.K. Xu Y. Daosukho C. Popova B. St. Clair D.K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with 6 μm plasmid DNA constructs containing the intronic enhancer fragment (I2E) of the human MnSOD gene in the pGL3 reporter gene and pRL-TK (Promega) containing Renilla cDNA at 1/10th the molar concentration of the I2E construct. Eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in fresh medium. Twenty-four hours later, transfected cells were trypsinized and replated in a 24-well plate at a density of 105 cells per well. After an additional 24 h, cells were treated either independently or in combination with 200 IU/ml recombinant human TNF-α (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), 100 nm PMA (Sigma), and 2 ng/ml IL-1β (Endogen, Woburn, MA). Twelve hours post-treatment, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Similarly, NPM expression vector (pcDNA3.1/NPM) and antisense NPM vector (pCMV/ASNPM) were individually co-transfected with I2E containing pGL3 reporter vectors in subconfluent HepG2 cells. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and replated in a 12-well plate at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells per well. After another 24 h, cells were treated with a PMA and cytokine combination for 12 h in the same manner as described above. Then the cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega); cell lysates were collected, and the samples were analyzed with the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Nuclear Extract Preparation—Nuclei were isolated from HepG2 cells as described by Dignam and co-workers (42Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Subconfluent monolayers of cells were collected and centrifuged at 100 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothretol (DTT), and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with the inclusion of protease inhibitors (pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Additionally, the phosphatase inhibitors NaF (5 mm) and Na3VO4 (1 mm) were included. The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 15 min. 12.5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the mixture was vigorously vortexed for 15 s. The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were separated by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 30 s at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was subsequently resuspended in buffer B containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 35% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor (pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, and incubated on ice for 20 min. Nuclear proteins in the supernatant fraction were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C and stored at –80 °C until used. Nuclear extracts older than 2 weeks were not used in any of the experiments. Protein concentration was determined by a colorimetric assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The consensus double-stranded oligonucleotides of the NF-κB sequence (5′-GAGACTGGGGAATACCCCAGT-3′) were purchased from Promega. The oligonucleotides were radioactively labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The probes were purified on 20% native polyacrylamide gels. Double-stranded DNA probes were eluted overnight at 37 °C in 600 μl of TE buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA. The activity of a radiolabeled probe was counted and stored at –80 °C. Probes were used within 2 weeks after preparation. In each reaction, 5 μg of nuclear protein or 0.25 μg of affinity purified proteins and 6 μl of 5× binding buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 50,000 counts/min of radiolabeled probe were used. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Supershift experiments to determine the components of the complex bound to the NF-κB consensus element following treatment were performed by adding 2 μg of the primary antibody (p50, p65, and c-Rel) to the binding reaction and extending the incubation to 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 μlof10× DNA loading buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 4% (v/v) glycerol). DNA-protein complexes were separated from unbound probes on 6% polyacrylamide native gel. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak film at –80 °C for 6–12 h. Protein Purification by Affinity Chromatography—The consensus NF-κB oligonucleotide was synthesized and labeled with biotin at the 5′ end of the oligonucleotide (Invitrogen). The NF-κB binding sequence is 5′-GAGACTGGGGAATACCCCAGT-3′, in which biotin is cross-linked at the 5′ end of the primer. The complementary sequence, 5′-ACTGGGGTATTCCCCAGTCTC-3′, was synthesized and annealed with the biotin-labeled NF-κB oligomer in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA by heating at 65 °C for 5 min followed by cooling to room temperature. Double-stranded DNA formation was verified by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, and only 95–100% annealed DNA was used to pull down NF-κB binding proteins. Extracts of nuclei treated with the PMA and cytokine (TNF-α and IL-1β) combination were suspended in binding buffer (12% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.12 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and proteins were purified as described by Hagenbuchle et al. (43Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3553-3559Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, biotin-labeled double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide was added directly to the nuclear suspension in the presence of poly(dI-dC) to a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml. Binding reactions were performed at 4 °C overnight with continuous gentle rotation in the presence of protease inhibitor (pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) at 1 μg/ml concentration. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min to remove debris that may have clogged the affinity column. The affinity column was prepared using high-performance streptavidin-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, a small column was packed with 500 μl of streptavidin-agarose-conjugated beads and washed five times with 1× binding buffer at 4 °C. The mixture of DNA-protein complex was passed through the column five times at a flow rate of 20 ml/h. The column was washed with binding buffer to remove nonspecific attachment of proteins. Additionally, the column was washed 5 times with 2-column volumes each of 1× binding buffer containing 60 mm KCl. Before elution, the column was further washed with binding buffer containing 150 mm KCl. NF-κB sequence-specific binding proteins or NF-κB interacting proteins were eluted with 450 mm KCl in 1× binding buffer. Purified proteins were then subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. Silver Staining—Purified proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were preincubated in the fixing solution (50% methanol, 5% acetic acid) for 30 min with gentle shaking and then washed2hin distilled water with gentle shaking. Gels were sensitized with 0.02% Na2S2O3 solution for 1 min and washed 2 times with distilled water. Gels were incubated in 0.1% AgNO3 for 20 min, washed 2 times with distilled water, and then proteins were visualized by incubating the gel in 2% Na2CO3 and 0.04% formaldehyde solution. In-gel Digestion—Protein bands were excised from the silver-stained gel and washed with 100 mm NH4HCO3 dehydrated with acetonitrile and rehydrated with 100 mm NH4HCO3. This cycle was repeated three times. The gel slices were reduced with 10 mm DTT, 100 mm NH4HCO3 at 56 °C for 60 min. Samples were S-alkylated with 20 mm iodoacetamide at 25 °C in the dark for 30 min and vacuum dried. In-gel digestion of excised bands with trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) and extraction of peptides were done according to Shevchenko et al. (44Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Neubauer G. Mortenson P. Mann M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 893-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Extracted peptide solutions were dried, rehydrated in 10 μl of 0.1% aqueous formic acid, and stored at –20 °C until analyzed. Mass Spectrometry—All mass spectra reported in this study were acquired by the University of Kentucky Mass Spectrometry Facility. LC/MS/MS spectra were acquired on a Finnigan LCQ “Classic” quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan Co., San Jose, CA). Separations were performed with HP 1100 high performance liquid chromatography modified with a custom splitter to deliver 4 μl/min to a custom C18 capillary column (300 μm inner diameter × 15 cm), packed inhouse with Macrophere 300 5-μm C18 (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL). Gradient separations consisted of a 2-min isocratic step at 95% water and 5% acetonitrile (both phases contain 0.1% formic acid). The organic phase was increased to 20% acetonitrile over 8 min and then increased to 90% acetonitrile over 25 min; held at 90% acetonitrile for 8 min and then increased to 95% in 2 min; finally they were returned to the initial conditions in 10 min (total acquisition time 45 min with a 10 min recycle time). Tandem mass spectra were acquired in a data-dependent manner. Three microscans were averaged to generate the data-dependent full-scan spectrum. The most intense ion was subjected to tandem mass spectrometry, and three microscans were averaged to produce the MS/MS spectrum. Masses subjected to the MS/MS scan were placed on an exclusion list for 2 min. Data Base Analysis of Peptides—Tandem spectra used for protein identification from tryptic fragments were searched against the NCBI nonredundant protein data base using an in-house copy of the MASCOT search engine. For MS/MS spectra, the peptides were also assumed to be monoisotopic, oxidized at methionine residues, and carbamidomethylated at cysteine residues with a 0.8 Da mass tolerance. Probability-based MOWSE scores were estimated by comparing search results"
https://openalex.org/W1976334985,"Phospholipase D (PLD) has been strongly implicated in the regulation of Golgi trafficking as well as endocytosis and exocytosis. Our aim was to investigate the role of PLD in regulating the biphasic exocytosis of insulin from pancreatic β-cells that is essential for mammalian glucose homeostasis. We observed that PLD activity in MIN6 pancreatic β-cells is closely coupled to secretion. Cellular PLD activity was increased in response to a variety of secretagogues including the nutrient glucose and the cholinergic receptor agonist carbamoylcholine. Conversely, pharmacological or hormonal inhibition of stimulated secretion reduced PLD activity. Most importantly, blockade of PLD-catalyzed phosphatidic acid formation using butan-1-ol inhibited insulin secretion in both MIN6 cells and isolated pancreatic islets. It was further established that PLD activity was required for both the first and the second phase of glucose-stimulated insulin release, suggesting a role in the very distal steps of exocytosis, beyond granule recruitment into a readily releasable pool. Visualization of granules using green fluorescent protein-phogrin confirmed a requirement for PLD prior to granule fusion with the plasma membrane. PLD1 was shown to be the predominant isoform in MIN6 cells, and it was located at least partially on insulin granules. Overexpression of wild-type or a dominant negative catalytically inactive mutant of PLD1 augmented or inhibited secretagogue-stimulated secretion, respectively. The results suggest that phosphatidic acid formation on the granule membrane by PLD1 is essential for the regulated secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells.

The ubiquitously expressed enzyme phospholipase D (PLD) 1The abbreviations used are: PLD, phospholipase D; PtdOH, phosphatidic acid; KRB, Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer; RIA, radioimmunoassay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; carbachol, carbamoylcholine; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; WT, wild type. catalyzes the hydrolysis of the major membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine to produce metabolically active phosphatidic acid (PtdOH). The cellular activity of the enzyme in mammalian cells is increased by a variety of growth factors, cytokines, or hormones (1Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and it is now clear from extensive in vitro and in vivo characterization that the two mammalian PLD species, PLD1 and PLD2, and their splice variants are subject to numerous regulatory inputs. PLD1 and PLD2 have an almost absolute requirement for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and the activity of PLD1, in particular, is also subject to synergistic regulation by small GTPases, including ADP-ribosylation factor and Rho, and also classical protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms such as PKCα and β (2Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Powner D.J. Wakelam M.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 62-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4Liscovitch M.

Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). PLDs are membrane-bound and have been shown by various methodologies to occupy a variety of cellular locations dependent on cell type. PLD1 isoforms in general appear to be located in the Golgi apparatus and on intracellular vesicles; PLD2 isoforms are found predominantly on the plasma membrane (2Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Lavie Y. Tang X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 245-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Consistent with these diverse locations and inputs, PLD exerts multiple cellular functions in different cell types; it has been implicated in numerous signal transduction cascades, in modulating vesicle trafficking, and also in regulating cytoskeletal organization (2Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A role for PLD in modulating vesicular trafficking is particularly compelling because its cellular location and regulation are consistent with such a role, as is its control of cytoskeletal reorganization, which often accompanies trafficking events (6Takenawa T. Itoh T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 190-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 7Martin T.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar).

PLD itself has been attributed roles in vesicular trafficking within the Golgi (11Freyberg Z. Sweeney D. Siddhanta A. Bourgoin S. Frohman M. Shields D. Mol. Biol.

Metabolism of glucose results in closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels), and the subsequent plasma membrane depolarization gates voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (26Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. Smith P.A. Ammala C. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 27Wollheim C.B.

The resultant rise in the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration is both necessary and sufficient for triggering an initial phase of insulin release that is mediated by fusion of predocked insulin granules with the plasma membrane. A second, long lasting phase of insulin secretion, involving recruitment of a reserve pool of granules, requires Ca2+ as well as a poorly defined signal generated from mitochondrial metabolism of glucose (27Wollheim C.B. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 28Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 29Straub S.G. Sharp G.W. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2002; 18: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Insulin secretion can also be regulated via inputs from hormones and neurotransmitters (30Wollheim C.B. Biden T.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 488: 317-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through classical signaling cascades involving transmembrane receptors, heterotrimeric G-proteins, and second messengers such as diacylglycerol and cyclic AMP. The molecular mechanisms underlying the translocation, priming, docking, and fusion of insulin secretory vesicles are poorly understood. Because of the evidence of a role for PLD in other examples of exocytosis, we sought here to investigate the role of this enzyme in stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. Work in the late 1980s identified an agonist-activated PLD-like activity in pancreatic β-cells (31Dunlop M. Metz S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 922-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and further characterization established that PLD activation was an event downstream of PKC activation following addition of secretagogue (32Dunlop M. Metz S.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In other studies PLD activity had also been indirectly implicated in both receptor- and PKC-mediated insulin secretion from mouse pancreatic β-cells (33Capito K. Hansen S.E. Thams P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 17: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Interestingly, insulin secretion from β-cells had also been shown to be promoted by the addition of exogenous PLD (34Metz S.A. Dunlop M. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, all of these early studies focused on PLD and PtdOH as signaling intermediates rather than addressing their role in exocytosis. More recently, PLD1 cDNA expression was seen to increase in response to interleukin-1β, suggesting that PLD may contribute to the early stimulatory effects of interleukin-1β on islet insulin release (35Chen M.C. Paez-Espinosa V. Welsh N. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2822-2828Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our own studies of the changes in global gene expression in β-cells treated with fatty acids also identified increases in PLD1 expression (36Busch A.K. Cordery D. Denyer G.S. Biden T.J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 977-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These effects were also observed at the level of cellular protein and PLD activity that led us to propose that increased expression of PLD1 may contribute to the up-regulation of distal secretory processes seen in fatty acid-treated pancreatic β-cells (37Biden T.J. Robinson D. Cordery D. Hughes W.E. Busch A.K. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S159-S165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of these studies identified a potential role or requirement for PLD activity in insulin secretion. Therefore, we have undertaken biochemical and cell biological analyses to fully assess the role of PLD genes in regulating insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells and define for the first time a requirement for PLD activity during insulin granule exocytosis. Materials—All of the chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich except as detailed below. Culture plasticware was obtained from Becton-Dickinson (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cell media and transfection reagents were from Invitrogen, except fetal calf serum was from Thermo-Trace (Noble Park, Victoria Australia) and bovine serum albumin was from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). Kits for radioimmunoassay (RIA) of rat insulin were obtained from Linco Research (St. Louis, MO), and radiolabeled myristic acid ([9,10-3H(N)]myristic acid) and En3Hance spray were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Chromatography plates were obtained from Whatman (Maidstone, UK); liquid scintillant and UltimaGold were from Packard Biosciences (Meriden, CT); autoradiography film (BioMaxMR) was from Kodak; and Fuji Super RX was from FujiFilm (Tokyo, Japan). The antibodies for Western blot or microscopic analysis were anti-PLD2, anti-PLD1, and anti-insulin (P6618, P5743, and I2018, respectively) from Sigma-Aldrich; anti-GFP (AB16901) from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA); anti-PLD (sc1784, sc17848) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-PLD1 (3832) from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); and anti-PLD (05-608) from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Waltham, MA). Antibodies were labeled with appropriate Cy2-, Cy3-, Cy5-, or horse rabbit peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, -goat, and -rabbit antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). DNA was visualized for microscopy using ToPro3 from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and actin with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or TRITC-conjugated phalloidin from Sigma-Aldrich. The coverslips were mounted in Immuno-fluore from ICN Biomedicals. Nitrocellulose transfer membranes were from Bio-Rad, and chemiluminescence reagents were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Adenovirus was titered using the Adeno-X Rapid Titer kit from BD Biosciences. Islet Isolation and Cell Culture—Islets were isolated from the pancreata of male Wistar rats (220 g) by ductal perfusion with collagenase, separated on a Ficoll gradient, and counted using a binocular microscope. MIN6 cells (passages ∼25–42) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in 24- and 6-well plates or 15-cm dishes. Before experimentation the cells, at a density between 2.5 × 105/ml and 5.0 × 105/ml, were switched to medium containing low glucose (6 mm) for 48 h followed by modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) containing 5 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2.8 mm glucose for 30 min. Insulin Secretion Assays—Batches of 15 isolated islets or cells grown in 24-well dishes were washed into KRB and then incubated in 0.5 ml (or 1 ml for islets) of prewarmed KRB containing additions as indicated for 1 h at 37 °C. An aliquot of KRB was then removed and diluted appropriately for analysis of insulin content by RIA. For perfusion MIN6 cells grown on 4.5-cm glass coverslips were washed with KRB and then placed in a POC (perfusion, open or closed) perfusion chamber, in a heated microscope stage (both supplied by PeCon, Erbach-Bach, Germany) at 37 °C. Prewarmed KRB was pumped using a peristaltic pump at 0.5 ml/min for 15 min before experimentation to allow the cells to equilibrate. The fractions (0.5 ml) were collected using a fraction collector for analysis of insulin content by RIA. PLD Assay—PLD activity was assessed using the transphosphatidylation reaction (38Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Engebrecht J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in 6-well dishes with 2–4 μCi/ml myristic acid for 7 h to label cellular phospholipids, washed once in modified KRB containing 2.8 mm glucose, and then preincubated for a further 30 min in 0.5 ml of the same medium at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated in 1 ml of prewarmed modified KRB containing additions as indicated, including ethanol or butan-1-ol for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed in PBS and scraped into PBS with 0.05% SDS, and the lipids were extracted using chloroform:methanol:aqueous (8:4:3 by volume), before separation by TLC on K6 Silica Gel 60 developed with the organic phase of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane:ethyl acetate:acetic acid: H2O (2:13:3:10 by volume) as previously described (15Hughes W.E. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The plates were visualized on autoradiography film using En3Hance spray, and appropriate samples were scraped and quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry (cpm phosphatidylalcohol/total phospholipids)/(cpm basal phosphatidylalcohol/basal total phospholipids). Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescence and direct fluorescence microscopy was performed on appropriately seeded MIN6 cells grown on glass coverslips. The cells transfected with GFP-PLD constructs (15Hughes W.E. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or GFP-phogrin (39Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE 2000 were prepared 24–48 h after transfection. The cells were either unfixed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, or fixed and permeabilized for 20 min in PBS with 0.2% Triton-X100 and washed into PBS 1% bovine serum albumin for blocking and antibody staining. The cells were mounted, after washing in PBS and water, in Immuno-fluore. The slides were examined using a Leica laser scanning confocal microscopes (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), DM IRE2 TCS SP2 AOBS with HCX PL APO 63×/1.4–0.6λ BL∞ 0.17 and 100×/1.4–0.7 oil immersion objectives and an argon laser providing 488-nm excitation lines, a HeNe laser providing 543-nm excitation lines, and a HeNe laser providing 633-nm excitation lines. The fluorochromes and fluoroproteins, Cy2, fluorescein isothiocyanate, Cy3, TRITC, Cy5, ToPro3, and GFP were excited with the appropriate excitation wavelengths, and individual channels were scanned in series. Each image represents a single ∼0.8-μm Z optical section. The images were processed using the Leica confocal software and Adobe Photoshop, version 7 (San José, CA) for an Apple computer. Cellular Fractionation—Eight 15-cm dishes of MIN6 cells were washed in cold (4 °C) PBS and resuspended in cold (4 °C) homogenization buffer (70 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) before disruption by Dounce homogenization. Post-nuclear supernatants were prepared by centrifugation in a Beckman JA-6 centrifuge at 3200 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. This was separated through a 14-ml equilibrium sucrose step gradient (1 ml; 2.0–0.6 m in 0.2 m steps sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA). The fractions were then processed for Western blot analysis, insulin RIA, or phospholipid analysis after extraction using chloroform:methanol:aqueous (8:4:3, by volume) and TLC as described above. Western Blot Analysis—The extracts were resuspended in urea sample buffer (8 m urea, 1% SDS, 100 mm Tris (unbuffered), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) before separation overnight by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred “wet” to nitrocellulose membranes in 25 mm Tris (unbuffered), 193 mm glycine, 20% methanol buffer using a Bio-Rad TransBlot apparatus. The membranes were blocked in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% milk powder followed by overnight incubation with antisera to PLD1s at 1/500 at 4 °C. For detection of antigen by chemiluminescence, the membranes were washed (three times in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), and an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody was employed for 1 h before visualization. Preparation of Recombinant Adenovirus—Adenovirus encoding WT and catalytically inactive (dominant negative) PLD1 K898R (40Sung T.C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) were generated using the AdEasy system (41He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3252) Google Scholar). In brief, hemagglutinin-tagged PLD1 cDNAs were subcloned into pShuttle-cytomegalovirus, and the PLD1 cDNAs and cytomegalovirus promoter were transferred into the adenovirus genome by homologous recombination in an adenovirus-packaging cell line. The adenoviruses were purified using caesium chloride ultracentrifugation and titration with Adeno-X Rapid Titer kit (according to the manufacturer's instructions). MIN6 cells were infected in low glucose medium overnight with virus at ∼50 plaque forming units/cell before transferring to fresh medium for insulin secretion or PLD assay. Data Presentation—All data are presented as the means ± S.E., unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance was by analysis of variance. Cellular PLD Activity Increases on Stimulation of Secretion in Pancreatic β-Cells—To establish whether PLD plays a regulatory role in the release of insulin from pancreatic β-cells, we sought to assess PLD activity under a variety of conditions known to promote insulin secretion from a pancreatic β-cell line, MIN6, which has a well documented response to metabolic and hormonal secretory stimuli (36Busch A.K. Cordery D. Denyer G.S. Biden T.J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 977-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 42Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions (2.8 mm glucose) MIN6 cells exhibited low levels of insulin secretion (∼0.85 ng/ml/min/106cells). When treated with 25 mm glucose, a depolarizing concentration of KCl (30 mm) or with the muscarinic cholinergic agent, carbachol, insulin secretion was 5–7-fold higher (Fig. 1A). Secretion can also be augmented by combinations of treatments such that combinations with carbachol elicited responses greater than 10-fold above basal (Fig. 1A). Cellular PLD activity was assessed under these conditions by measuring changes in the levels of radiolabeled phospholipids. The changes in PtdOH (data not shown) suggested significant increases in PLD activity in response to the secretory stimuli. However, cellular PLD activity cannot be accurately assessed by measuring PtdOH levels because this phospholipid is rapidly metabolized and has numerous sources alternate to PLD-mediated hydrolysis. Cellular PLD activity is optimally quantified by taking advantage of the unique ability of PLD to “transphosphatidylate” primary alcohols (38Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Engebrecht J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the presence of a primary alcohol (such as ethanol or butan-1-ol), PLD hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine predominantly results in the production of metabolically stable phosphatidylalcohol, measurement of which accurately reflects cellular PLD activity. In the presence of ethanol (not shown) or butan-1-ol, the secretory stimuli glucose, carbachol, and KCl increased production of phosphatidylalcohol 2–4-fold above basal, and combinations with carbachol induced PLD activity by more than 10-fold (Fig. 1B). Inhibitors of Secretion Also Inhibit PLD Activity—The above data indicate that secretory stimuli can activate PLD in pancreatic β-cells. To further test this relationship, we assessed secretory competence and PLD activity under stimulatory conditions in the presence of diazoxide, which opens K+ channels to prevent gating of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (28Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), or clonidine, an α2-adrenoreceptor agonist that inhibits secretion at a variety of levels (43Sharp G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1781-C1799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, both inhibitors have profound effects on insulin secretion from MIN6 cells irrespective of the secretory stimulus (Fig. 2A). Under the same conditions cellular PLD activity was reduced, notably more than 50% in the presence of glucose and carbachol (Fig. 2B). These data confirm a close relationship between insulin secretion and PLD activity in pancreatic β-cells. Phospholipase D1 Is Located on Vesicles in Pancreatic β-Cells—To further assess the potential role of PLD in insulin secretion, we first sought to identify PLD isoforms and their cellular location in pancreatic β-cells. MIN6 extracts were analyzed by Western blot for PLD using a variety of antisera generated to PLD proteins. The analysis revealed a single antigen of ∼120 kDa corresponding to the predicted size of the PLD1 gene product (Fig. 3A). No antigen corresponding to PLD2 (∼108 kDa) could be detected using antisera against generic PLDs or against PLD2 specifically. However, PLD2 is expressed in RBL-2HT mast cells (44Sarri E. Pardo R. Fensome-Green A. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and antigen corresponding to PLD2 could be detected in extracts prepared from these cells (Fig. 3A). This finding is consistent with our gene transcript analysis (37Biden T.J. Robinson D. Cordery D. Hughes W.E. Busch A.K. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S159-S165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with a reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of primary β-cells (35Chen M.C. Paez-Espinosa V. Welsh N. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2822-2828Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) where cDNA for PLD1 was detected but not PLD2. We also assessed the intracellular distribution of PLD1 antigen by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Using various PLD1 antisera, generally a punctate, vesicle-like, distribution of antigen, largely excluded from the nucleus, was seen in MIN6 cells (Fig. 3B). This distribution was seen for endogenous PLD1 (Fig. 3B, top panels) and overexpressed PLD1 (Fig. 3B, middle panels). Using cells transiently transfected with GFP-PLD1, this vesicle-like distribution was also evident, and it was clear that the various antisera used accurately label PLD1 protein (not shown). Therefore, it is likely that the pattern seen microscopically represents the intracellular distribution of endogenous PLD1. In addition, using antisera to insulin it was clear that some, but by no means all, of the punctate structures identified with the PLD1 antisera also stained for insulin (Fig. 3B, bottom panels). A partial colocalization is perhaps not unexpected given that not all cells within the population would be expected to be secretion-competent. These data indicate that PLD1 is likely to represent the predominant PLD species in pancreatic β-cells and that the protein is located on small intracellular vesicles, many of which also contain insulin. Secretagogue-stimulated PLD Activity Is Located on Insulin Granules—To confirm that vesicular PLD1 is responsible for secretagogue-activated PLD activity, we carried out Western blot and phospholipid analyses of fractions generated from sucrose gradient centrifugation of post-nuclear supernatants, rich in cellular vesicles, from MIN6 cells. Examination by Western blot identified that PLD1 antigen was concentrated in fractions 6–12 (Fig. 4). Fractionation and subsequent phospholipid analysis of postnuclear extracts from MIN6 cells labeled with [3H]myristic acid and treated with 0.4% butan-1-ol identified that the PLD-specific product, phosphatidylbutanol, was predominantly seen in fractions 8–12, overlapping significantly with PLD1 antigen (Fig. 4). The fractions were"

Mdm2 mRNA level is transcriptionally regulated by p53 in response to stress such as DNA damage, and its protein level and subcellular localization are post-translationally modulated by the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Previous studies showed that PTEN, a dual specificity phosphatase that antagonizes phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling, is capable of blocking MDM2 nuclear translocation and destabilizing the MDM2 protein. Results from our current study demonstrate an additional role for PTEN in regulating MDM2 functions; PTEN modulates Mdm2 transcription and isoform selection by negatively regulating its P1 promoter. In Pten-null cell lines and prostate cancer tissues, Mdm2 P1 promoter activity is up-regulated, resulting in increased L-Mdm2 expression and enhanced p90MDM2 isoform production. Furthermore, PTEN controls Mdm2 P1 promoter activity through its lipid phosphatase activity, independent of p53. Thus, our results provide a novel mechanism for PTEN in controlling MDM2 oncoprotein functions.

The murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) was originally cloned as an amplified gene present on double minute chromosomes in the tumorigenic 3T3DM murine cell line (1Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The human homolog, HDM2, mapping to human chromosome 12q13-14, is overexpressed in over 30% of soft tissue sarcomas due to amplification (2Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar, 3Momand J. Jung D. Wilczynski S. Niland J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3453-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). HDM2 expression is controlled by two different promoters (6Juven T. Barak Y. Zauberman A. George D.L. Oren M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3411-3416PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar, 8Zauberman A. Flusberg D. Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2584-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), leading to alternatively spliced transcripts that differ in their 5′-untranslated regions. Transcription from the first promoter P1 is independent of p53 and yields mRNA (L-HDM2) with exon 2 spliced out. Conversely, transcription from the second promoter P2 is p53-dependent. p53 binds to the two p53-responsive elements in the intron 1 and gives rise to a transcript (S-HDM2) lacking exon 1 but containing exon 2. Multiple gene products of MDM2 have been identified in mammalian cells. The full-length p90MDM2 oncoprotein binds to and inactivates the p53 tumor suppressor protein whereas a short p76MDM2 isoform that lacks the first 49 amino acids of p90MDM2 cannot bind p53 (4Perry M.E.

A recent study suggests that the ratio of the two MDM2 protein products, p90MDM2 to p76MDM2, is determined by the relative abundance of L-Mdm2 mRNA. The L-Mdm2 predominantly gives rise to p90MDM2 whereas p76MDM2 appears to be the product of translational initiation at codon 50 (AUG) in exon 4 (5Saucedo L.J. Myers C.D. Perry M.E. J. Biol.

Thus, p53 and MDM2 form an autoregulatory feedback loop in which p53 positively regulates MDM2 expression and MDM2 negatively regulates p53 protein level and activity (7Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Overexpression of HDM2 has been observed in many primary human cancers. Increasing evidence suggests that, besides regulating p53 levels and functions, MDM2 can also participate in tumorigenesis independent of p53 (31Jones S.N. Ansari-Lari M.A. Hancock A.R. Jones W.J.

PTEN dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)P3, the product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). PTEN mutants that retain protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity but lose the ability to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)P3 are found in tumors, indicating that the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is required for its tumor suppressor activity (22Myers M.P.

PTEN has been shown to physically interact with p53 and prevent its degradation by excluding a portion of the p53 from the p53-MDM2 complex (24Freeman D.J. Li A.G. Wei G. Li H.H. Kertesz N. Lesche R.

Additionally, PTEN inhibits AKT, a key kinase responsible for phosphorylation of MDM2 and its subsequent nuclear translocation (25Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our finding suggests that PTEN regulates Mdm2 transcription by suppressing its P1 promoter. PTEN exerts this function indirectly by modulating the activity of unknown transcription factor(s) through its lipid phosphatase activity. Thus, besides the aforementioned mechanisms, PTEN can also up-regulate p53 level and activity by down-regulating Mdm2 transcription and controlling MDM2 isoform expression. Additionally, PTEN may have a role in suppressing MDM2-mediated tumorigenesis independent of p53 activity. Cell Culture and Transfection—MEF cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). To reintroduce PTEN-WT, C124S (CS) and G129E (GE) mutants, the above plasmids were cotransfected with a CMV-EGFP vector. Green fluorescent protein-positive cells were then sorted by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter and analyzed as described. PC3 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cell transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed 24 h post-transfection for protein and luciferase activity measurements. Plasmid Constructs—The various 5′-truncated Mdm2 luciferase reporter gene plasmids were created by PCR from mouse genomic DNA and cloned into the pGL3Basic luciferase vector (Promega) (28Ogawara Y.

Findley H.W. Jiang R. Woods W.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6357-6362PubMed Google Scholar). A common 3′ primer was used for all the constructs except P1. The primers used were: 5′-AAGCTTCGCCCAGCAGACGGCTGC-3′ and 5′ primers were 5′-GCTAGCGGCGGCCGCTAAGCCCCG-3′ for P1-P2, 5′-GCTAGCGGCGTTCTCTCCGCGGAC-3′ for T1, 5′-GCTAGCGTACCCGCTCCGTGGGCG-3′ for T2, 5′-GCTAGCACGAGGCTGGGCGACCGT-3′ for T3, 5′-GCTAGCGGGCCCGCTCCGGGGTCG-3′ for T4, and 5′-GCTAGCACTGGGCTGGGCCGAGTT-3′ for T5. Primers for the P1 promoter alone were 5′-GCTAGCGGCGGCCGCTAAGCCCCG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGACCGGCCGCTCCTAGGCT-3′. The identity of all Mdm2 promoter constructs was confirmed by sequencing prior to use. Reporter assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with the dual luciferase system from Promega. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. -Fold activation was calculated by dividing the normalized luciferase activity by the normalized activity obtained in the presence of the vector and reporter plasmid alone. Western Blot Analysis—Whole-cell extract was prepared by lysing the cells in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysates from each transfection were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using anti-p53 (DO.1, Pab-240, FL-393-G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), PTEN (9552, Cell Signaling Technologies), MDM2 (Ab-2, Ab-3 Oncogene Research Products), or vinculin (VIN-11-5, Sigma) or actin (A 4700, Sigma) antibodies. To evaluate the role of the PI 3-kinase pathway in PTEN-controlled MDM2 protein levels, cells were pretreated with 20 μm LY294002 for 24 h, and then Western analysis was performed as described above. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was purified from 1 × 106 PtenΔloxp/Δloxp or Ptenloxp/loxp cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Fifteen micrograms of total RNA was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel plate containing 5.4% formaldehyde. RNA was transferred to a Hy-bond-N+ nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and probed using standard methods. Quantitation was performed with Image Quant (Molecular Dynamics). A 110-bp cDNA fragment of Mdm2 exon 1 and Mdm2 exon 3-4 was used to make radioactive probes for hybridization. The membrane was probed with a fragment of actin RNA as control. RT-PCR—RNA was isolated using RNAqueous kit (Ambion). Five μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) (Promega) as a primer, and the cDNA product of this reaction was amplified by PCR. The amount of cDNA added to each PCR was normalized using actin cDNA as the standard. Actin amounts were measured by limited PCR using the primer pair 5′-CGGTTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGGG-3′ and 5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTACGCACCA-3′. Two primer sets were used to amplify Mdm2. One set (5′-AGCCGCCGCCTTCTCGTC-3′ and 5′-CTGCTACTTCCCGCGCAT-3′) amplifies only RNAs initiated at the constitutive promoter (exon 1), and the second set (5′-TGGGCGAGCGGGAGACCGAC-3′ and 5′-ACAACAACACACACGATA-3′) amplifies RNAs initiated at both the constitutive and p53-responsive promoters (exon 2). Generation of Tet-inducible Pten Cell Line—PtenΔloxp/Δloxp cells were infected with the supernatant from Phoenix cells that had been transfected (as per Gary Nolan's protocol from his web page) with the pRevTet-On vector. The infected PtenΔloxp/Δloxp cells were selected with 400 μg/ml G418 for 10 days, and then colonies were allowed to grow out under 200 μg/ml G418 selection. Then PtenΔloxp/Δloxp cells were infected with a pMSCV-IRES/EGFP-TRE PTEN vector. The pMSCV-IRES/EGFP-TRE PTEN vector is a modified pMSCV-IRES/EGFP vector. The PhCMV*-1 promoter and the PTEN cDNA were cut out of the pTRE2 vector with XhoI/SalI and inserted into the SalI site 3′ of the IRES EGFP in the pMSCV-IRES/EGFP vector. The double positive PtenΔloxp/Δloxp cells were selected by G418 resistance and GFP expression by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Dose response curve and time courses of response calculations were performed to optimize conditions (data not shown). PTEN Negatively Regulates Mdm2 mRNA and Protein Levels—Our previous study, together with others, indicates that PTEN negatively controls MDM2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation by antagonizing the PI 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway (25Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 26Mayo L.D. Dixon J.E. Durden D.L. Tonks N.K. Donner D.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 21843-21850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). We also found that both Mdm2 mRNA and protein levels were increased in Pten-null (PtenΔloxp/Δloxp, Δ/Δ) cells, when compared with its isogenic WT controls (Ptenloxp/loxp, L/L) (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine the mechanism involved, we pretreated cells with actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription, and found that it completely abolished the differences between Pten WT and Pten null cells (Fig. 1, A and B, right panels). This result suggests that PTEN controls not only MDM2 phosphorylation and subcellular localization but also negatively regulates Mdm2 transcription. PTEN Negatively Regulates Mdm2 Promoter P1 Independent of p53—To further study the cis acting elements required for PTEN-regulated Mdm2 transcription, a genomic DNA fragment consisting of both basal (P1) and p53-responsible (P2) promoter regions of the Mdm2 gene was isolated and ligated to luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 2A, P1-P2). The reporter construct was then cotransfected with a fixed amount of p53 but a variable amount of PTEN into PC3 cells, a human prostate cancer cell line lacking both p53 and PTEN. As shown in Fig. 2B, PTEN negatively regulated p53-induced Mdm2 expression in a dosage-dependent manner. Mechanistically, PTEN may regulate Mdm2 promoter activity by either interfering with p53 binding to the P2 promoter or through a mechanism independent of p53 binding. To distinguish between these two possibilities, a series of truncation mutations were generated containing different regions of the Mdm2 promoter (see diagram in Fig. 2A) and cotransfected into PC3 cells with PTEN and p53. We found that the first 100 nucleotides in the P1 promoter were absolutely required for PTEN regulation because the reporter construct lacking this fragment failed to respond to the suppression effect of PTEN (Fig. 2C, compare P1-P2 with T1). To further determine whether the activity of PTEN depends on the transcription activation of p53 on the P2 promoter, PTEN was cotransfected with the full-length P1 promoter alone or the truncated promoter lacking the first 100 nucleotides in the P1 promoter region into primary p53- null embryonic fibroblasts (Fig. 2D). PTEN was able to down-regulate Mdm2 expression to the same level in the absence of p53 and p53-responsible promoter P2 but not with truncated promoter P1 (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results suggest that PTEN negatively regulates Mdm2 transcription by modulating the P1 promoter independent of the p53 protein or the p53 control element. PTEN Negatively Regulates Mdm2 through Its Lipid Phosphatase Activity—To determine whether down-regulation of the Mdm2 P1 promoter is because of the lack of PTEN phosphatase activity or because of other structural motifs within PTEN, the Mdm2 reporter constructs, P1-P2 and T1, were cotransfected with either WT Pten or Pten C124S (CS), a catalytically inactive mutant, into PC3 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, WT PTEN, but not the C124S mutant, could significantly down-regulate P1-P2 promoter, confirming that regulation of Mdm2 expression is dependent on the phosphatase activity of PTEN. To further test whether PTEN controls Mdm2 transcription through its lipid or protein phosphatase activity, we conducted a similar experiment using the PTEN G129E (GE) mutant. PTEN G129E is a mutation isolated from human cancer that is deficient in lipid phosphatase activity but is functional with synthetic peptide substrates. As shown in Fig. 3A, the PTEN G129E mutant behaved similarly to the C124S as they were both unable to down-regulate Mdm2 expression to the same extent as the WT PTEN. On the other hand, there is no difference between WT and mutant PTEN on the truncated Mdm2 promoter lacking the 100 nucleotides in promoter P1. Cells treated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 behaved similarly to cells overexpressing WT PTEN (Fig. 3A). These results further demonstrated the importance of the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN or the PI 3-kinase pathway in PTEN-controlled Mdm2 expression. Because PTEN-MDM2-p53 forms a self-reinforced circuit in regulating each other's level and activity, it would be interesting to know whether MDM2 could participate in PTEN-regulated transcription of its own promoter. For this, a p53-/- Mdm2-/- MEF cell line was used. As demonstrated in Fig. 3B, LY294002 or a dominant negative form of AKT could dramatically inhibit transcription activities of full-length (P1-P2) and P1 promoters to the same extent in the absence of both endogenous p53 and MDM2. Again, deletion of the first 100 nucleotides in the promoter P2 region (T1) significantly abolished the aforementioned effects. Thus, PTEN controls Mdm2 transcription by negatively regulating its P1 promoter. PTEN exerts this function through its lipid phosphatase activity by antagonizing the PI 3-kinase pathway independent of p53 and MDM2. The Biological Consequences of PTEN-Regulated Mdm2 Transcription—In human, P1 is a constitutive promoter independent of p53 and yields a long mRNA (L-HDM2) with exon 2 spliced out. Conversely, transcription from the second promoter P2 depends on p53 binding and gives rise to a short transcript (S-HDM2) lacking exon 1 (see diagram in Fig. 4A). To test whether PTEN regulation of the P1 promoter would lead to alteration of the L-Mdm2/S-Mdm2 ratio, the endogenous Mdm2 transcripts in the presence and absence of PTEN were investigated. RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses demonstrated that PTEN loss dramatically increased the expression of Mdm2 transcripts containing exon 1 (Fig. 4B, Mdm2 Exon 1) but not exon 2. Conversely, reintroducing WT Pten but not mutant Pten lacking lipid phosphatase activity into PtenΔloxp/Δloxp cells dramatically suppressed L-Mdm2 expression (Fig. 4C, left). Again, overexpression of PTEN in p53-null fibroblasts led to down-regulated L-Mdm2 mRNA but not S-Mdm2 mRNA (Fig. 4C, right). To determine whether the effect of PTEN on Mdm2 mRNA expression requires de novo protein synthesis, PtenΔloxp/Δloxp and Ptenloxp/loxp cells were pretreated with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, and L-Mdm2 levels were measured by RT-PCR analysis and compared with untreated cells. Cycloheximide could completely abolish the negative regulation of PTEN on Mdm2 L-Mdm2 mRNA expression (Fig. 4D), suggesting that PTEN controls transcription of Mdm2 by modulating the production or activity of currently unknown transcription factor(s) (see “Discussion”). PTEN Controls MDM2 Isoform Production—The Mdm2 locus encodes the p90MDM2 oncoprotein that binds to and inactivates the p53 tumor suppressor protein. A short p76MDM2 isoform of MDM2 has recently been identified that lacks the first 49 amino acids of p90MDM2 and cannot bind p53. Interestingly, p76MDM2 can antagonize the p90MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 and lead to increased level and activity of p53 (4Perry M.E. Mendrysa S.M. Saucedo L.J. Tannous P. Holubar M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5733-5738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Using epitope mapping and site-directed mutagenesis, Saucedo et al. (5Saucedo L.J. Myers C.D. Perry M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) showed that the ratio of the two MDM2 protein products, p90MDM2 to p76MDM2, is determined by the relative abundance of L-Mdm2 mRNA; L-Mdm2 predominantly gives rise to p90MDM2 whereas p76MDM2 appears to be the product of translational initiation at codon 50 (AUG) in exon 4. To test whether PTEN will alter the ratio of p90MDM2 to p76MDM2, we measured the endogenous MDM2 protein products in the isogenic Ptenloxp/loxp and PtenΔloxp/Δloxp cells, using an antibody against both p90MDM2 and p76MDM2. As shown in Fig. 5, PTEN negatively regulates the p90MDM2 isoform and enhances the ratio differences between p76MDM2 and p90MDM2 (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2). To test whether the isoform regulation is directly correlated with PTEN protein levels, an inducible system was generated in which Pten expression can be controlled in a tet-dependent manner in PtenΔloxp/Δloxp cells. Re-expression of Pten led to suppression of the p90MDM2 isoform without significant change in p76MDM2 (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4), resulting in an increased p76MDM2/p90MDM2 ratio as compared with untreated PtenΔloxp/Δloxp cells (Fig. 5). Similarly, inhibiting PI 3-kinase activity by LY294002 treatment also increased the p76MDM2/p90MDM2 ratio (Fig. 5, lane 5). This result suggests that PTEN functions by regulating not only the PI 3-kinase pathway or p53 protein level and activity but also by regulating Mdm2 expression and isoform production. PTEN Negatively Regulates L-Mdm2 Expression and p90MDM2 Isoform Production in Vivo—To further support the function of PTEN in regulating Mdm2 transcription, we turned our attention to the Pten-null prostate cancer models generated recently in our laboratory (34Wang S. Gao J. Lei Q. Rozengurt N. Pritchard C. Jiao J. Thomas G.V. Li G. Roy-Burman P. Nelson P.S. Liu X. Wu H. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) because PTEN loss has been highly associated with both human and murine prostate cancer development. cDNAs were prepared from individual prostate ventral lobes of 9-week-old WT (Ptenloxp/loxp;PB-Cre4-) and Pten homozygous deletion MUT (Ptenloxp/loxp;PB-Cre4+) male mice. RT-PCR analysis showed complete Pten deletion (Pten Exon 5) and the dramatic increase of Mdm2 exon 1 expression in Pten-deleted prostate tissue (MUT, Fig. 6A), accompanied by an ∼10-fold increase in p90MDM2 isoform production, as compared with the WT prostate tissues (Fig. 6B). These results provide strong evidence that PTEN down-regulates Mdm2 in vivo in a manner similar to what we observed in cell lines and suggest that altered Mdm2 level and activity may contribute to tumor formation caused by PTEN loss. In this study, we demonstrated a novel mechanism by which PTEN controls the expression and function of the MDM2 oncoprotein; PTEN, by antagonizing the PI 3-kinase pathway, negatively regulates the P1 promoter on the 5′ end of the Mdm2 gene, leading to decreased L-Mdm2 expression and reduced p90MDM2 isoform production. Because the p90MDM2 isoform is capable of binding and inactivating p53, this novel mechanism, together with AKT, controlled MDM2 phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation (25Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 26Mayo L.D. Dixon J.E. Durden D.L. Tonks N.K. Donner D.B. J. Biol.

A key issue that remains to be addressed is the identification of the transcription factor(s) that binds to the P1 promoter. Blocking de novo protein synthesis by cycloheximide would be effective enough to even out the differences of L-Mdm2 expression caused by PTEN. This experiment suggests that PTEN modulates Mdm2 exon 1 expression through cooperation with the required newly synthesized protein(s), which are components of transcriptional machinery that have been undergoing continuous turnover. Because transcriptional regulation of Mdm2 P1 promoter activity by PTEN can be mimicked by blocking of the PI 3-kinase activity and depends on de novo protein synthesis, the production or activity of this transcription factor(s) is most likely under the control of the PI 3-kinase pathway. Although transcription factors, e.g. AP-1 and Ets (30Ries S. Biederer C. Woods D. Shifman O. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. McMahon M. Oren M. McCormick F. Cell. 2000; 103: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), are able to modulate Mdm2 transcription, both of them have been characterized to work through the p53 responsible promoter P2. Our preliminary analysis on DNA sequences corresponding to either P1 or the first 100 nucleotides of the P1 promoter did not identify binding sites of any known transcription factors. Future work is needed to identify such transcription factors and signaling effectors downstream of PI3K responsible for the regulation of the P1 promoter. Our study suggests that differential promoter usage may contribute to alternative splicing products that lead to preferential MDM2 isoform expression (4Perry M.E. Mendrysa S.M. Saucedo L.J. Tannous P. Holubar M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5733-5738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 32Mendrysa S.M. McElwee M.K. Perry M.E. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 264: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Many previous studies have shown that alternative splicing and internal translational initiation both contribute to the regulation of MDM2 function. Overexpression of HDM2 has been observed in many primary human cancers. Increasing evidence suggests that, besides regulating p53 levels and functions, MDM2 can also participate in tumorigenesis independent of p53 (31Jones S.N. Ansari-Lari M.A. Hancock A.R. Jones W.J.

Cancer Res. 2003; 89: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In human prostate carcinoma, overexpression of MDM2 has been frequently observed (35Leite K.R. Franco M.F. Srougi M.

A. 2003; 100: 11636-11641Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). All these data support our observation that, accompanied with Pten deletion in the murine prostate tumor, Mdm2 mRNA and protein levels are both increased, which may consequently lead to the development of prostate cancer. In conclusion, in the presence of p53, PTEN up-regulates the p53 level as well as its activity by down-regulating Mdm2 transcription and p53 binding activity. However, in the absence of p53, PTEN may have a role in suppressing MDM2-mediated tumorigenesis through regulation of Mdm2 transcription as well as isoform production. It is important to further investigate the functional linkage between PTEN and p76MDM2 or other MDM2 isoforms that can be modulated by PTEN in human cancer samples, and overexpression of MDM2 may contribute to the tumorigenic process initiated by PTEN mutation.

https://openalex.org/W1972111705,"Substrates of the ubiquitin system are degraded by the 26 S proteasome, a complex protease consisting of at least 32 different subunits. Recent studies showed that RPN4 (also named SON1 and UFD5) is a transcriptional activator required for normal expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteasome genes. Interestingly, RPN4 is extremely short-lived and degraded by the 26 S proteasome, establishing a feedback circuit that controls the homeostatic abundance of the 26 S proteasome. The mechanism underlying the degradation of RPN4, however, remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that the proteasomal degradation of RPN4 is mediated by two independent degradation signals (degron). One degron leads to ubiquitylation on internal lysine(s), whereas the other is independent of ubiquitylation. Stabilization of RPN4 requires inhibition of internal ubiquitylation and inactivation of the ubiquitin-independent degron. RPN4 represents the first proteasomal substrate in S. cerevisiae that can be degraded through ubiquitylation or without prior ubiquitylation.

This finding makes it possible to use both yeast genetics and biochemical analysis to investigate the mechanism of ubiquitin-independent proteolysis. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the primary intracellular machinery responsible for elimination of abnormal proteins and selective destruction of regulatory proteins involved in a wide range of cellular processes (1Hershko A.

Substrates of the 26 S proteasome are normally degraded via ubiquitylation on internal lysines. Several lines of evidence from our early work, however, suggested that ubiquitylation might not be required for the degradation of RPN4, a transcriptional activator of the S. cerevisiae proteasome genes (5Mannhaupt G. Schnall R. Karpov V. Vetter I. Feldmann H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 27-34Google Scholar, 6Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Google Scholar). First, the degradation of RPN4 was not noticeably impaired in the uba1-2 mutant, which underexpresses the E1 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; ha, hemagglutinin; Ub, ubiquitin. enzyme, and is therefore deficient in ubiquitylation of proteins (7Swanson R. Hochstrasser M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 193-198Google Scholar). Second, overexpression of UbK48R,G76A, a ubiquitin mutant that inhibits the formation of lysine 48-linked multiubiquitin chains (8Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Google Scholar), did not significantly decrease the turnover rate of RPN4. Third, the half-life of RPN4 in wild type cells was comparable with that in the mutants that lack one of the known E2 enzymes or one of the following E3 enzymes: UBR1, UFD4, RSP5, TOM1, HUL4 or HUL5 (9Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Google Scholar, 10Sasaki T. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 262: 940-948Google Scholar, 11Wang G. Yang J.

In the present study, we explore the mechanism underlying the degradation of RPN4. Strikingly, we found that the proteasomal degradation of RPN4 can be mediated by two independent degrons. One involves ubiquitylation on internal lysine(s), whereas the other is apparently ubiquitin-independent. Stabilization of RPN4 requires inhibition of both degrons. This finding demonstrates that the same proteasomal substrate can be degraded dependently or independently of ubiquitylation. Strains and Plasmids—The S. cerevisiae strains used were JD52 (MATa trp1-Δ63 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 leu2-3, 112 lys2-801); AVY302 (a rpn2Δ::URA3 derivative of JD52, Ref. 6Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Google Scholar); Y791 (MATa cim5-1 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 leu2Δ1, Ref. 13Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C.

Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Google Scholar). Details of plasmid constructs are available upon request. Lysine-to-arginine substitutions were constructed by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. For pulse-chase analysis, RPN4 and truncated derivatives were expressed from the PCUP1 promoter in low copy vectors RS313 or RS314 (15Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.A. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). For detection of protein ubiquitylation, RPN41–229 and K0RPN41–229 were expressed from the PCUP1 promoter in high-copy vector RS425. Wild type ubiquitin (Ub), N-terminally myc-tagged ubiquitin (mycUb), His6-tagged ubiquitin (His6Ub), and lysine-free ubiquitin (K0Ub) were expressed from the PCUP1 promoter in high copy vector RS423. In the yeast one-hybrid assay, RPN41–229, K0RPN41–229, and RPN41–151 were fused to the C terminus of the GAL4 DNA binding domain in vector pGBDUC1 (14James P. Halladay J. Craig E. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of the GAL4 fusions was assessed by expression of the ADE2 reporter gene in strain PJ69-4A. Protein Analysis—The procedures of immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and pulse-chase assays were described previously (6Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Google Scholar). Extracts were prepared either by vortexing yeast cells with glass beads in buffer A (1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mix (Roche Diagnostics), or by mixing cells with an equal volume of 2× SDS buffer (2% SDS, 30 mm dithiothreitol, 90 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5), followed by incubation at 100 °C for 5 min. Extracts prepared with 2× SDS buffer were diluted 10-fold with buffer A plus protease inhibitors before used for immunoprecipitation. For Ni-NTA pull-down assays, extracts prepared with 2× SDS buffer were diluted 10-fold with buffer B (1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm imidazole) plus protease inhibitors before incubated with Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with buffer B, and bound proteins were eluted by heating at 95 °C for 2 min with 2× SDS loading buffer and then separated by SDS-PAGE (8% gel), followed by immunoblotting. For detection of ubiquitylation, 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide was included in buffer A and buffer B. The N-terminal Fragment of RPN4 Can be Degraded without Internal Ubiquitylation—Substrates of the 26 S proteasome are normally degraded via ubiquitylation on internal lysine. Our previous work showed that the turnover rate of RPN4 was not noticeably changed in the uba1-2 S. cerevisiae mutant that underexpresses the E1 enzyme (6Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Google Scholar). Overexpression of UbK48R,G76A, a ubiquitin mutant that inhibits the formation of lysine 48-linked multiubiquitin chains (8Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Google Scholar), only slightly decreased the degradation of C-terminally FLAG-tagged RPN4 in a pulse-chase assay (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 7–9 and lanes 4–6). Interestingly, RPN4 conjugated with a moiety of UbK48R,G76A, which is a poor substrate for the deubiquitylating enzymes, remained short-lived (Fig. 1B, lanes 7–9), further suggesting that multiubiquitylation is not required for RPN4 degradation even though RPN4 can be ubiquitylated. To determine whether ubiquitylation is dispensable for RPN4 degradation, we set out to make lysine-to-arginine substitutions to knock out the potential ubiquitylation site(s) of RPN4. Instead of mutating all 35 lysines borne in the 531-amino acid RPN4 protein (5Mannhaupt G. Schnall R. Karpov V. Vetter I. Feldmann H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 27-34Google Scholar), we focused on the 11 lysines that are located in the N-terminal 229-residue fragment (RPN41–229), which is as short-lived as intact RPN4 (Fig. 1, A and C). By contrast, RPN4206–531, an N-terminally truncated RPN4 derivative, was found to be stable (Fig. 1, A and C), indicating that RPN41–229 bears a degron or degrons mediating the degradation of RPN4. We, therefore, generated a lysine-free version of RPN41–229 (K0RPN41–229) by mutating all 11 lysines to arginines. Taking advantage of the transcriptional activation domain located in residues 211–229 (Fig. 1A), we used yeast one-hybrid assay to examine whether the lysine-to-arginine substitutions could cause deleterious conformational alteration. As shown in Fig. 1D, the transcriptional transactivation activity of K0RPN41–229 was comparable with that of RPN41–229, excluding a drastic structural change by the lysine-to-arginine mutations. Consistently, mutations of the 11 N-terminal lysines to arginines did not affect the transcriptional activity of full-length RPN4 (data not shown). We then compared the turnover rates of RPN41–229 and K0RPN41–229 by pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 2A). C-terminally FLAG-tagged K0RPN41–229 (lanes 4–6) was rapidly degraded even though its turnover was modestly slower than that of RPN41–229 (lanes 1–3). Since the FLAG tag carries 2 lysines, which might serve as a ubiquitylation site, we went on to replace the FLAG tag with the hemagglutinin (ha) epitope, which contains no lysine. Again, C-terminally ha-tagged K0RPN41–229 was efficiently degraded even though its half-life was extended to ∼5 min compared with the ∼2 min half-life of RPN41–229 (Fig. 2A, lanes 10–12 and 7–9, and C). These results indicate that RPN41–229 can be degraded in the absence of internal ubiquitylation. RPN41–229 Bears Two Independent Degrons—It has been reported that proteins may be targeted to the proteasome via ubiquitylation at the free amino group of the N-terminal residue (16Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Google Scholar, 17Bloom J. Amador V. Bartolini F. Demartino G. Pagano M. Cell. 2003; 115: 71-82Google Scholar). We, therefore, sought to determine whether the degradation of K0RPN41–229 is mediated by N-terminal ubiquitylation. Specifically, we examined whether the degradation of K0RPN41–229 is governed by its N-terminal sequence, similar to the previously reported proteins that are degraded via N-terminal ubiquitylation (16Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Google Scholar, 17Bloom J. Amador V. Bartolini F. Demartino G. Pagano M. Cell. 2003; 115: 71-82Google Scholar). Pulse-chase analysis was carried out to measure the degradation of N-terminally ha-tagged K0RPN41–229. Remarkably, addition of the ha tag to the N terminus completely stabilized K0RPN41–229 (Fig. 2B, lanes 4–6, and C). Consistently, deletion of the first 10 amino acids also completely inhibited the degradation of C-terminally FLAG-tagged K0RPN41–229 (Fig. 2B, lanes 10–12). These results indicated that the degradation of K0RPN41–229 is mediated by a signal involving the N-terminal 10 amino acids and that this signal is interfered by fusion of the ha tag to the N terminus. Accordingly, this signal was tentatively named N-terminal degron. Strikingly, addition of the ha tag to the N terminus or deletion of the first 10 amino acids only slightly decreased the degradation of RPN41–229 that carries the internal lysines (Fig. 2, A–C). Therefore, RPN41–229 can be degraded via two independent mechanisms. One mechanism is dependent on a degron that leads to internal ubiquitylation, whereas the other is mediated by the N-terminal degron that is independent of internal ubiquitylation. Inactivation of both degrons is required for stabilization of RPN41–229. Both degrons mediate proteasome-dependent degradation because RPN41–229 was stable in the rpn2Δ proteasome mutant (Fig. 2D). The N-terminal Degron of RPN41–229 Is Ubiquitylation-independent—We next asked whether the N-terminal degron of RPN41–229 is ubiquitylation-dependent or -independent. To this end, we began with three assays to examine whether K0RPN41–229 is ubiquitylated in vivo. The first assay was a direct immunoblot. C-terminally ha-tagged RPN41–229 and K0RPN41–229 were expressed in cim5-1, a proteasome mutant in which RPN4 is stable (6Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Google Scholar). To sensitize the detection, either wild type Ub or mycUb was co-overexpressed in the cim5-1 cells. Whereas slower migrating derivatives of RPN41–229 were readily detectable (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2), no modified forms of K0RPN41–229 were detected by anti-ha antibody in the immunoblotting assay (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). The derivatives of RPN41–229 appeared to be ubiquitylated species in that they migrated slower in the presence of mycUb than in the presence of Ub (compare lanes 2 and 1). We further compared ubiquitylation of RPN41–229 and K0RPN41–229 using an immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting assay (Fig. 3B). Extracts from cim5-1 cells co-overexpressing C-terminally ha-tagged RPN41–229 with Ub (lane 2) or mycUb (lane 3), C-terminally ha-tagged K0RPN41–229 with Ub (lane 4) or mycUb (lane 5), and void vector with mycUb (lane 1) were immunoprecipitated by anti-ha antibody. Precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-myc antibody. No ubiquitylated species of K0RPN41–229 could be detected, whereas mycUb conjugates of RPN41–229 were detectable (lane 3). Similar results were obtained from a Ni-NTA pull-down assay with His6Ub (Fig. 3C). To minimize the activity of the deubiquitylating enzymes that could destroy Ub-protein conjugates during sample preparation, we prepared extracts under denaturing conditions from cim5-1 cells co-overexpressing C-terminally ha-tagged RPN41–229 with Ub (lane 1) or His6Ub (lane 2) and C-terminally ha-tagged K0RPN41–229 with Ub (lane 3) or His6Ub (lane 4). Comparable amounts of different extracts were incubated with Ni-NTA beads, and retained proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-ha antibody. RPN41–229 but not K0RPN41–229 was shown to be conjugated with His6Ub. Thus, it appears that ubiquitylation of RPN41–229 occurs exclusively on the internal lysines, strongly suggesting that the N-terminal degron of K0RPN41–229 is ubiquitylation-independent. To rule out the possibility that ubiquitylation, even though not detectable in above assays, might be required for the degradation of K0RPN41–229, we decided to examine the effect of overexpression of K0Ub on the degradation of K0RPN41–229. If the N-terminal degron of K0RPN41–229 is ubiquitylation-dependent, overexpression of K0Ub, which prevents formation of multi-Ub chains on substrates (8Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Google Scholar), would be expected to inhibit the degradation of K0RPN41–229. Pulse-chase analysis was performed to measure the turnover rates of C-terminally ha-tagged K0RPN41–229 and RPN41–229 and N-terminally ha-tagged RPN41–229 in the presence or absence of K0Ub overexpression. N-terminally ha-tagged RPN41–229 whose degradation is exclusively dependent on internal ubiquitylation due to inactivation of the N-terminal degron was completely stabilized by overexpression of K0Ub (Fig. 3D, compare lanes 16–18 and 13–15, and E). Remarkably, overexpression of K0Ub only partially inhibited the degradation of C-terminally ha-tagged RPN41–229 (Fig. 3D, compare lanes 4–6 and 1–3, and E) and virtually exhibited no effect on the halflife of C-terminally ha-tagged K0RPN41–229 (Fig. 3D, compare lanes 10–12 and 7–9, and E). Thus, the N-terminal degron of RPN41–229 is not inhibited by overexpression of K0Ub. Taken together, these results conclude that the N-terminal degron of K0RPN41–229 is independent of ubiquitylation. Intact RPN4 Is Degraded by Two Independent Degrons—We finally tested whether intact RPN4 can also be independently degraded by internal ubiquitylation and the N-terminal degron. Pulse-chase analysis was conducted to measure the turnover rates of C-terminally FLAG-tagged RPN4 mutants that carry lysine-to-arginine substitutions for the first 11 lysines (RPN4R11) or deletion of the N-terminal 10 amino acids (RPN4Δ1–10) or both (RPN4R11/Δ1–10). The half-life of RPN4R11 was stabilized ∼2.5-fold compared with that of wild type RPN4, whereas the degradation of RPN4Δ1–10 was only slightly decreased (Fig. 4, A and B). Remarkably, both mutant proteins were completely degraded in the 45-min chase. By contrast, RPN4R11/Δ1–10 was virtually not degraded (Fig. 4, A and B). These results confirm that RPN4 can be degraded by two independent mechanisms: the N-terminal degron and internal ubiquitylation. Stabilization of RPN4 requires inactivation of both degrons. Our early work showed that the degradation of RPN4 was not significantly changed in the uba1-2 mutant, which underexpresses the E1 enzyme, suggesting that ubiquitylation may not be necessary for the degradation of RPN4 (6Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Google Scholar). However, whether or not RPN4 degradation can be mediated by ubiquitylation was not examined in this study. We report here that RPN4 can be degraded via two independent degrons. One is apparently independent of ubiquitylation, which is in line with the early finding (6Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Google Scholar), whereas the other involves internal ubiquitylation. Different from the relatively minor change of RPN4 degradation in the uba1-2 mutant (6Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Google Scholar), inhibition of internal ubiquitylation by Lys-to-Arg mutations partially but noticeably stabilized RPN4 (Fig. 4). This discrepancy is not unexpected in that the activity of the ubiquitin conjugation system is weaker but not abolished in the uba1-2 mutant. By contrast, Lys-to-Arg mutations completely destroy the ubiquitin-dependent degron of RPN4. The physiological significance that RPN4 bears two independent degrons is currently unknown. It is possible that these two degrons mediate degradation of different populations of RPN4 in vivo. However, we consider this possibility less likely in that RPN4 can be efficiently degraded in the presence of either one of the two degrons. Another possibility is that the two-degron mechanism may provide a broader input into the regulatory system involving RPN4. For instance, physiological perturbations that damage the ubiquitin conjugation machinery, but not the proteasome activity, will not result in impairment of RPN4 degradation. Accumulation of RPN4 and consequent overexpression of its target genes would otherwise be detrimental to the cell in the absence of a fully functional ubiquitin conjugation system. The mechanism underlying the ubiquitin-independent degradation of RPN4 is currently unclear. It is possible that direct binding of RPN4 to the proteasome, which was demonstrated in our early work (6Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Google Scholar), mediates the degradation of RPN4 without prior ubiquitylation. Our observations thus far, however, did not favor this possibility. RPN4206–531, which directly binds to the proteasome, is stable, whereas RPN41–229, which is not physically associated with the proteasome, is unstable (Fig. 1 and Ref. 6Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Google Scholar). In addition, purified RPN4 from Escherichia coli could not be directly degraded by purified yeast 26 S proteasomes in vitro (data not shown), suggesting that an ancillary factor is necessary for the ubiquitylation-independent degradation of RPN4, reminiscent of ornithine decarboxylase whose degradation by purified 26 S proteasomes requires the antizyme co-factor (18Coffino P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 188-194Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence including the first 10 amino acids of RPN4 may be required for interaction with the putative ancillary factor. Several mammalian proteins, including p21Cip1, c-Jun, c-Fos, and p53, have also been reported to be degraded either via ubiquitylation or through a ubiquitin-independent manner (19Verma R. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2000; 101: 341-344Google Scholar, 20Jariel-Encontre I. Pariat M. Martin F. Carillo S. Salvat C. Piechaczyk M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11623-11627Google Scholar, 21Sheaff R.J.

However, the mechanism underlying the ubiquitin-independent degradation of these proteins remains largely unknown due to limitation of experimental approaches. Further analysis of the ubiquitin-independent degron of RPN4 using both yeast genetics and biochemical analysis will provide better insights into the mechanism of ubiquitin-independent proteolysis that has begun to emerge.

BRCA1 function is regulated by a variety of mechanisms including transcriptional control, phosphorylation, and protein-protein interactions. Recent studies have shown that BRCA1 is a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttle protein. Its subcellular localization is controlled by a nuclear localization signal-mediated nuclear import via the importin receptor pathway and a nuclear export signal-facilitated nuclear export through a CRM1-dependent pathway. Using the human breast cancer cell line, MCF7, the subcellular distribution of BRCA1 was assessed by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting analyses of fractionated subcellullar extracts. Ionizing radiation stimulated BRCA1 nuclear export in a dose-dependent manner. This DNA damage-induced BRCA1 nuclear export utilized a CRM1-dependent mechanism and also required wild-type p53, whose function was abrogated by the E6 protein in MCF7 cells. In addition, the dependence on p53 was confirmed using a second cell type operating a tetracycline-inducible system. The effect of ionizing radiation on BRCA1 export was observed in every phase of the cell cycle, although BRCA1 localization did vary between the G1, S, and G2/M phases.

Markedly reduced BRCA1 expression is also observed in high grade sporadic breast and ovarian cancers, implying its role in sporadic breast and ovarian cancer as well (1Rahman N. Stratton M.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 95-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Despite accumulated evidence suggesting that BRCA1 is necessary for many cellular processes ranging from DNA replication, cell cycle checkpoint control, DNA repair, regulation of transcription, protein ubiquitination, and apoptosis, to chromatin remodeling (2Kerr P.

It is possible that dysfunction of many or all of these BRCA1 properties may result in cancer development.BRCA1 function is regulated by a variety of mechanisms including transcription (6Rosen E.M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7138-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Given the critical role of BRCA1 in nuclear processes, such as DNA repair, transcription, and chromosomal remodeling, the subcellular localization of the BRCA1 protein could be an important mechanism in regulating its function. Consistent with this notion, recent evidence has shown that BRCA1 is a shuttle protein, which is actively transported between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Two nuclear localization signals (NLS) 1The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; NES, nuclear export signal; IHC, immunohistochemistry; IR, ionizing radiation; LMB, leptomycin B; Tet, tetracycline; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; P-H3, phosphorylated histone H3; Gy, gray; NE, nuclear export; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. 1The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; NES, nuclear export signal; IHC, immunohistochemistry; IR, ionizing radiation; LMB, leptomycin B; Tet, tetracycline; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; P-H3, phosphorylated histone H3; Gy, gray; NE, nuclear export; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. assist the targeting of the BRCA1 protein to the nucleus through the importin system (17Chen C.F.

In addition, one functional nuclear export sequence (NES) located at its N terminus, which facilitates the export of BRCA1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through the CRM1 (chromosome region maintenance 1)/exportin pathway (20Rodriguez J.A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38589-38596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, little is known about how BRCA1 shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm is controlled.BARD1, the BRCA1-associated RING domain protein, binds to BRCA1 at its ring domain and chaperones BRCA1 nuclear import via a mechanism independent of NLS/importin system. BARD1 also inhibits BRCA1 nuclear export (NE) by masking the NES located in the ring domain (21Fabbro M. Rodriguez J.A. Baer R. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21315-21324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Overexpression of BARD1 resulted in enhancement of DNA damage-induced BRCA1 nuclear foci formation. p53 has been reported to bind directly to BRCA1 at its N terminus ring domain and its C terminus BRCT domain (22Zhang H. Somasundaram K. Peng Y. Tian H. Zhang H. Bi D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 23Chai Y.L. Cui J. Shao N. Shyam E. Reddy P. Rao V.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). BRCA1 enhances p53-mediated transcriptional activation (22Zhang H. Somasundaram K. Peng Y. Tian H. Zhang H. Bi D. Weber B.L.

Park I. Yin Y. Solomon E. Ouchi T. Aaronson S.A. Lee S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7450-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is not known whether a change in the subcellular location of BRCA1 is an alternative mechanism for p53-mediated regulation of BRCA1 function in response to DNA damage.Several lines of evidence suggest interplay between BRCA1 function and cell cycle regulation. The BRCA1 protein plays important role in controlling DNA damage induced G2/M checkpoint. A mutation in an ATM-dependent phosphorylation site in BRCA1, serine 1423, abolishes the ability of BRCA1 to mediate the G2/M checkpoint (27Chodosh L.A. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1998; 3: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the cell cycle determines the level of BRCA1 expression (28Gudas J.M. Li T. Nguyen H. Jensen D. Rauscher III, F.J. Cowan K.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 717-723PubMed Google Scholar), with the highest levels found in S phase (29Vaughn J.P. Cirisano F.D. Huper G. Berchuck A. Futreal P.A. Marks J.R. Iglehart J.D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4590-4594PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, rapidly proliferating cells generally have a higher expression level of BRCA1. Cells in G0/G1 express BRCA1 at a low level; the BRCA1 protein level increases during progression through G1, reaching a peak during S phase and remaining elevated in G2/M as compared with cells in G0/G1 (30Vaughn J.P. Davis P.L. Jarboe M.D. Huper G. Evans A.C. Wiseman R.W. Berchuck A. Iglehart J.D. Futreal P.A. Marks J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 711-715PubMed Google Scholar, 31Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In parallel with the cell cycle dependent expression level, BRCA1 undergoes hyperphosphorylation during late G1 and S phases of the cell cycle and is transiently dephosphorylated early after M phase (16Ruffner H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7138-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 32MacLachlan T.K. Dash B.C. Dicker D.T. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31869-31875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Several studies showed that IR and chemotherapy agents produce decrease of BRCA1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels (26Arizti P. Fang L. Park I. Yin Y. Solomon E. Ouchi T. Aaronson S.A. Lee S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7450-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Sugrue M.M. Shin D.Y. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the regulation of BRCA1 subcellular distribution or how it relates to p53-dependent functions such as G1 arrest in response to DNA damage.Given the critical roles of BRCA1 in several DNA damage response pathways, we investigated the effect of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage on BRCA1 localization in human cells. We found that IR promoted BRCA1 NE in human breast cancer cells through a CRM1-dependent mechanism. We further demonstrated that DNA damage-induced NE of BRCA1 critically depends upon the function of wild-type p53 and occurred irrespective of the phase of the cell cycle. Our results imply that p53-dependent BRCA1 NE might be an alternative mechanism to regulate BRCA1 function in response to DNA damage. Abnormal BRCA1 shuttling in breast cancer cells lacking functional p53 may result in aberrant DNA repair and increased genetic instability in surviving cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The human breast cancer cell line MCF7 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 20 mm Hepes, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin (all purchased from Sigma). When required for MCF7 cells, leptomycin B (LMB; purchased from Sigma) was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 6 ng/ml for the indicated period of time. Capan-1 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Sigma) with 15% FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. The EJ-p53 cell line (a gift from Stuart A. Aaronson, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York) was cultured in complete DMEM medium (as described), also containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Tet), 75 μg/ml Hygromycin B, and 500 μg/ml G418. (Tet and Hygromycin B purchased from Sigma; G418 from Fisher). The removal of Tet from the medium resulted in p53 induction (34Bravo R. Macdonald-Bravo H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1549-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). For transient overexpression of CRM1 in MCF7 cells, 0.4 μg of purified expression vector carrying YFP-CRM1 cDNA (provided by Dr. Beric R. Henderson) was transfected in to cells using LipofectAMINE™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were irradiated at 24 h after transfection, and BRCA1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed a further 24 h after irradiation.Cell Cycle Synchronization and Flow Cytometry Sorting and Analysis—To synchronize MCF7 cells, cells were seeded at low density, and the serum was withdrawn from the culture medium. Cells were arrested at G0/G1 phase by growth factor deprivation (32MacLachlan T.K. Dash B.C. Dicker D.T. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31869-31875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cells were synchronized for 24 h before they were irradiated; serum was then added to the cultured cells immediately after exposure to IR. BRCA1 IHC staining was carried out 24 h after IR treatment. For cell cycle profile analysis using flow cytometry, cells with or without IR were washed in PBS three times, fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol 15-ml tubes on ice for at least 60 min. Before proceeding to flow cytometry analysis, cells were incubated with freshly mixed buffer, composed of 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (from Sigma), 0.5 mg/ml RNase, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 30 min on ice. Samples were analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). To separate and collect MCF7 in each phase of the cell cycle, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml Bisbenzimide H 33342 (Calbiochem) for 30 min. Cells were then harvested, washed in PBS, and subjected to sorting using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Cytomation MoFlo), with gate settings based on DNA content for G1, S, and G2/M phases. After sorting, ∼1 × 104 cells in each phase were transferred onto culture slides (Fisher) using Cytospin 2 (SHANDON) at 700 rpm/8 min and fixed by ice-cold methanol for immunohistochemical staining. Sorted cells were also used for whole cell extracts and subsequent Western blot analysis.Retrovirus Infection—Retrovirus infections were carried out using 60-mm dishes with MCF7 cells at 60% confluence. For infection, cell monolayers were washed two times in DMEM without serum or antibiotics, followed by the addition of 2 ml of DMEM containing 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma) and 0.5 ml of virus stocks of E6 and LXSN, respectively (virus stocks were obtained from Carl Q. Maki at Harvard University, School of Public Health). After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, 4 ml of DMEM without serum was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 4 h. Infection solution was removed from cells, followed by the addition of DMEM with 10% FBS serum and incubation for 24 h. Then cells were split into T25 tissue culture flasks at a seeding density of 1000 cells/flask and grown another 24 h. Forty-eight hours postinfection, selection medium (DMEM with 10% FBS) containing 750 μg/ml G418 was added to cells, and selection was continued 7–10 days to obtain MCF7/E6- and MCF7/LXSN-containing cell populations. To maintain selection, cells were cultured in complete DMEM containing 500 μg/ml G418.Immunohistochemistry Studies—MCF7, MCF7/E6, MCF7/LXSN, and EJ-p53 cells were seeded into four-chamber tissue culture slides (Fisher), incubated overnight. Adherent cells were treated with IR using a Siemens Stabilipan 2 x-ray generator at 280 kVp, 12 mA, and a dose rate of 2.08 Gy/min. Cells were then cultured for different periods of time as indicated in the result and were subjected to immunohistochemical staining. To assess dose effects, cells were analyzed 24 h after irradiation with 0, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 Gy. To document the time course of response, cells were irradiated with 2.5 Gy and analyzed 0, 8, 24, and 48 h post-IR.Cells were fixed in 100% methanol at -20 °C for 20 min, followed by a 10-s permeabilization with ice-cold acetone or were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 15 min, followed by 10-min permeabilization in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. All cells were washed in PBS and blocked in PBS with 10% FBS. BRCA1 was detected by immunofluorescence using mouse anti-BRCA1 monoclonal antibody Ab-1 (Oncogene Science) at a 1:50 dilution, which recognizes an aminoterminal epitope of BRCA1. p53 was detected using sheep anti-human p53 polyclonal antibody Ab-7 (Oncogene Science) at a 1:400 dilution, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was detected using mouse anti-human PCNA monoclonal antibody Ab-1 (Oncogene Science) at a 1:100 dilution, and phosphohistone H3 (P-H3) was detected using rat anti-P-H3 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at 1:500 dilution. The secondary antibodies used were AlexaFluor594-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), AlexaFluor488-labeled donkey anti-sheep IgG (Molecular Probes), and AlexaFluor488-labeled chicken anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes), each at a 1:500 dilution. Images were collected by an Olympus microscope (BX51) and processed using Adobe PhotoShop software.Cell Fractionation and Western Blot Analyses—For Western blot analyses, either whole cell extract or cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were used. Cells were irradiated with 2.5 Gy and incubated for various periods of time as indicated. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysis of the monolayer culture in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, and protease/phosphatase inhibitors: 2.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mm Na3VO4, 1.0 mm leupeptin). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were isolated by first incubating cells in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and protease/phosphotase inhibitors). Cells were then allowed to swell on ice for 15 min to allow rupture of the cell membrane, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation. The cytoplasmic fractions were located in the supernatants, which were collected. The nuclear pellets were then incubated for 20 min in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm EDTA, 420 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, protease/phosphatase inhibitors) on ice (mixing lysates every 5 min). The soluble nuclear protein fraction was collected after centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. Total protein concentration in each extraction was measured using BCA protein assay reagent system from Pierce.Protein samples were loaded and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Equal loading of the cytoplasmic, nuclear, or total protein samples after transfer to the Immobilon-P membrane was confirmed by staining the membrane with Ponceau Red. The subsequent immunoblots would not be conducted if we detected that there was any difference between lanes due to loading or transfer efficiency. To detect the protein of interest, the membranes were incubated with mouse anti-BRCA1 antibody (Ab-1, Oncogene Science; diluted 1:1000 in PBS, 3% milk), mouse anti-human p53 monoclonal antibody (Ab-6; Oncogene Science (diluted 1:100 in PBS, 3% milk)), mouse anti-human p21 monoclonal antibody (Clone SXM30; BD Biosciences (1–2 μg/ml in PBS, 3% milk)), mouse anti-human BRCA1 monoclonal antibody (Ab-1; Oncogene Science (diluted 1:100 in PBS, 3% milk)), mouse anti-human Exportin-1/CRM1 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences; diluted 1:100 in PBS, 3% milk), or mouse anti-human β-actin (Sigma; diluted 1:2,000 in PBS, 3% milk), respectively. Bands were detected using the ECL chemiluminescience detection method (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed on x-ray film.RESULTSIR Induces BRCA1 Nuclear Export—We examined the subcellular distribution of the BRCA1 protein in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in MCF7 cells by subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis. Our results showed that before treatment with IR, the BRCA1 protein is present predominantly in the nuclear compartment with only a small amount of BRCA1 protein being detected in the cytoplasmic fraction. However, a notably increased amount of BRCA1 was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction at 4 and 8 h after exposure of MCF7 cells to 5 Gy of IR (Fig. 1), suggesting that IR causes BRCA1 to translocate to the cytoplasm.To confirm this initial observation and further quantitatively analyze BRCA1 distribution, we examined subcellular localization of BRCA1 before and after IR by IHC staining using anti-BRCA1 antibody (Ab-1). As reported previously (20Rodriguez J.A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38589-38596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) by others, we observed that three subcellular patterns of BRCA1 distribution in untreated MCF7 cells: nuclear only (N), cytoplasmic only (C), and both nuclear and cytoplasmic (N/C) (Fig. 2a). The distribution of BRCA1, scored by their subcellular localization pattern, is nuclear-dominant, with 45.3 ± 1.31% being nuclear only, 44.5 ± 1.68% being cytoplasmic and nuclear, and only 11.00 ± 1.9% being cytoplasm only. However, after IR, the pattern of BRCA1 subcellular distribution in MCF7 cells shifts to cytoplasmic-dominant (Fig. 2b). At 24 h after 2.5 Gy of IR, the proportion of cells with N pattern staining decreased from 45.3 ± 1.31% to 27.9 ± 2.6% (p < 0.01), whereas cells with the C pattern of staining increased from 11.00 ± 1.9 to 26.9 ± 2.46% (p < 0.05). By 48 h after IR, cells with N and C patterns were 14.45 ± 0.40 and 38.46 ± 2.23% (p < 0.01), respectively, suggesting that BRCA1 protein continues to be exported from the nucleus to cytoplasm over a prolonged period after initial DNA damage.Fig. 2Nuclear export of BRCA1 protein after IR in MCF7 cells. The BRCA1 protein was identified by the Ab-1 antibody and the AlexaFluor594-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (red). The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). a, the different subcellular distribution patterns of BRCA1 are shown. The N, N/C, and C patterns of staining for BRCA1 are shown (see “Results”). b, the kinetics of BRCA1 translocation after exposure to 2.5-Gy IR. Each data point represents the results (mean ± S.E.) from three independent experiments. At least 500 cells were counted per experiment. The percentage of cells exhibiting N (black circles), N/C (open circles), or C (black triangles) patterns of BRCA1 distribution are shown. c, IR-induced nuclear export of BRCA1 as a function of dose. Cells were stained at 24 h after IR at the doses indicated. The number of observations and symbols are as in b. d, the subcellular distribution of PCNA (red), in contrast to BRCA1. The distributions of the nuclear protein PCNA before and 24 h after 10 Gy of IR are displayed in the upper and lower panels, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, we examined DNA damage-induced BRCA1 NE as a function of the IR dose given to MCF7 cells. We found that 2.5 Gy of IR was sufficient for inducing significant BRCA1 NE (Fig. 2c). The degree of IR-induced BRCA1 NE reached a plateau after 5 Gy, with the N pattern reducing to 22.7 ± 0.55%, the C pattern rising to 32.2 ± 2.80%, and the N/C pattern remaining unchanged as a proportion. The data demonstrate that IR leads to nuclear export of BRCA1 in a dose-dependent manner up to a maximum effect at 5 Gy.To exclude the possibility that the increase in the levels of cytoplasmic BRCA1 protein after IR is due to nuclear membrane leakage, we examined the subcellular distribution of the PCNA. Similar to BRCA1, PCNA is a nuclear protein associated with the nuclear matrix, based on the proportion of the protein that is resistant to detergent extractions (data not shown). PCNA is directly involved in DNA replication and commonly localized at the sites of ongoing DNA synthesis (35Wenz F. Azzam E.I. Little J.B. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, PCNA also plays a role as an accessory factor in many DNA repair pathways, such as nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and possibly in homologous recombination (36Miura M. J. Radiat. Res. 1999; 40: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 37Gu L. Hong Y. McCulloch S. Watanabe H. Li G.M.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5485-5488PubMed Google Scholar). Using immunohistochemical staining with anti-PCNA antibody, we found that prior to IR, PCNA was evenly distributed throughout the nucleus in a majority of cells, and discrete PCNA nuclear foci were observed in very few MCF7 cells. Twenty-four hours after doses up to 10 Gy of IR, PCNA remained in the nucleus and formed numerous large, brightly stained foci (Fig. 2d). No cytoplasmic signal of PCNA was detected. These results are consistent with findings from previous studies, suggesting that PCNA foci form in the nucleus in response to IR (35Wenz F. Azzam E.I. Little J.B. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). More importantly, this result confirmed that there was no significant cytoplasmic contamination from nuclear protein leakage as a consequence of nuclear membrane injury under the experimental conditions used for studying BRCA1 NE, further suggesting that BRCA1 shuttling from the nuclear to the cytoplasmic compartment is a regulated process in response to DNA damage.Effect of the Cell Cycle on BRCA1 Subcellular Distribution—BRCA1 protein is highly expressed in the nucleus of rapidly proliferating cells in a cell cycle-dependent manner, with low levels in G1 phase, peak levels at the G1/S border, and high levels maintained through S phase (30Vaughn J.P. Davis P.L. Jarboe M.D. Huper G. Evans A.C. Wiseman R.W. Berchuck A. Iglehart J.D. Futreal P.A. Marks J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 711-715PubMed Google Scholar, 39Rajan J.V. Marquis S.T.

To explore the mechanisms involved in BRCA1 shuttling, we examined whether BRCA1 subcellular distribution is associated with the cells being in various phase of the cell cycle. Untreated MCF7 cells were separated into G0/G1, S, or G2/M phases according to their DNA content and collected using a flow cytometric sorting technique (Fig. 3a). M phase cells were recognized by their positive IHC staining of P-H3 in the G2/M population (Fig. 3b). Using IHC staining with BRCA1 antibody, we found that the patterns of BRCA1 distribution were considerably different in each cell cycle phase. As shown in Fig. 3, c and d, during S phase, BRCA1 accumulated predominantly in the nucleus (e.g. 79.19 ± 2.23% of S phase cells being N pattern). As cells entered t"

Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4479) Google Scholar). Sterol and nonsterol end-products of mevalonate metabolism accelerate degradation of reductase as part of a complex, multivalent feedback mechanism that ensures cellular sterol homeostasis (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 505-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HMG-CoA reductase is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized glycoprotein that consists of two distinct domains (3Liscum L. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 522-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domain of 339 amino acids, which contains eight membrane-spanning regions separated by short loops, anchors the protein to ER membranes (4Olender E.H. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain of 548 amino acids projects into the cytosol and contains all of the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Two independent observations demonstrate the crucial role of the NH2-terminal domain in sterol-accelerated degradation of reductase. First, the expression of the truncated cytosolic COOH-terminal domain of reductase resulted in the production of a stable, catalytically active protein whose degradation was not accelerated by sterols (6Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Second, a chimeric protein that consisted of a fusion protein between the transmembrane domain of reductase and soluble β-galactosidase exhibited sterol-regulated degradation in a manner similar to wild-type reductase (7Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sterol-accelerated degradation of reductase is believed to occur in ER membranes and can be blocked by inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome, which leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated forms of the enzyme (8Inoue S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that sterol-accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase is dependent upon the presence of at least one member of a pair of ER-resident membrane proteins called Insig-1 and Insig-2 (10Sever N. Song B.-L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 11Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S.

When reductase was overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells by transfection, the enzyme was no longer degraded rapidly in response to sterol treatment. Overexpression of Insig-1 restored regulated degradation of overexpressed reductase, and this degradation coincided with sterol-dependent binding of Insig to the membrane attachment region of reductase. Similar results were obtained with Insig-2. 2B.-L. Song and R. A. DeBose-Boyd, unpublished observations. 2B.-L. Song and R. A. DeBose-Boyd, unpublished observations. Expanding on these initial observations, we recently used RNA interference to demonstrate that sterol-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of endogenous reductase in human fibroblasts requires Insig-1 or Insig-2 (10Sever N. Song B.-L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, sterol-regulated ubiquitination of reductase displayed an absolute Insig-dependence in transient transfection assays. Insig binding appears to be a prerequisite for reductase ubiquitination and degradation as indicated by alanine substitution experiments that revealed that formation of Insig-reductase complexes required the tetrapeptide sequence YIYF located in the second transmembrane segment of reductase (10Sever N. Song B.-L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). When the YIYF sequence was mutated, reductase no longer bound to Insigs, and the enzyme was no longer subject to sterol-regulated ubiquitination or degradation. The substitution of arginine for lysine 248 in reductase did not affect Insig binding but abolished detectable reductase ubiquitination and slowed its degradation, strongly implicating lysine 248 as the major site for Insig-dependent, sterol-regulated ubiquitination. The data summarized above support a model in which sterols promote binding of HMG-CoA reductase to Insigs in a reaction mediated by the reductase transmembrane domain. The reductase-Insig complex then recruits other proteins, presumably components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, culminating in ubiquitination of reductase, which marks the protein for proteasomal degradation. The apparent site of reductase ubiquitination, lysine 248, is predicted to lie immediately adjacent to the seventh membrane-spanning helix, suggesting that the final step in reductase ubiquitination is mediated by a membrane-bound ubiquitin ligase. Degradation of HMG-CoA reductase in isolated membranes and permeabilized cells has been reported to be mediated by membrane-associated proteases (12Correll C.C. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), later identified as proteasomes because of their sensitivity to lactacystin (13McGee T.P. Cheng H.H. Kumagai H. Omura S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25630-25638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In these studies, sterols were added to living cells to mark reductase for degradation prior to permeabilization or homogenization. Thus, these studies could not determine the mechanism for sterol regulation nor the location of the putative ubiquitin ligase that triggers the degradative process. To circumvent these problems, in the current study we have characterized a permeabilized cell system that supports ubiquitination of reductase following the addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol and rat liver cytosol in vitro. The sterol-regulated in vitro ubiquitination reaction requires the presence of Insig proteins, thus mimicking the reaction that occurs in living cells. The results indicate that reductase is modified by a membrane-bound ubiquitin ligase and that the only cytosolic participant in the ubiquitination reaction is the E1 enzyme that activates ubiquitin. Materials—We obtained MG-132 and digitonin from Calbiochem; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (affinity-purified) from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; ubiquitin, ubiquitin-aldehyde, Fraction I, Fraction II, and S100 isolated from HeLa cells, and ubiquitin activating-enzyme (E1) from Boston Biochem (Cambridge, MA); sterols from Steraloids, Inc. (Newport, RI); and NH2-terminal FLAG-tagged ubiquitin from Sigma. Stock solutions of digitonin were prepared by dissolving 1 g of solid in 10 ml of boiling H2O. After cooling to room temperature, the solutions were filtered, aliquoted, and stored at -20 °C until use. Other reagents were obtained from previously described sources (14DeBose-Boyd R.A.

Lipoprotein-deficient serum (d > 1.215g/ml) was prepared from newborn calf serum by ultracentrifugation (15Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Monolayers of SV-589 cells, an immortalized line of human fibroblasts expressing the SV40 large T antigen (16Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Stock cultures of SV-589 were maintained in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS). Preparation of Rat Liver Cytosol—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (350–400 g) were housed in colony cages, maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, and fed a Harlan Teklad 4% Mouse/Rat Diet 7001. At 3 h into the dark cycle, the rats were anesthetized by halothane inhalation followed by intraperitoneal injection of Nembutal, after which their livers were perfused with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl through the portal vein at room temperature. The livers were excised, cut into small pieces, and adjusted to 2 ml/g with ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.2, 250 mm sorbitol, 70 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm potassium EGTA, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, plus protease inhibitors (20 μm leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml N-acetylleucinalleucinal-norleucinal, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The resuspended livers were then disrupted in a Polytron homogenizer followed by 10 strokes in a 50-ml Dounce homogenizer fitted with a Teflon pestle. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants from this spin were subjected sequentially to centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, 186,000 × g for 1 h, and 186,000 × g for 45 min. The final supernatant, designated as cytosol (30–40 mg of protein/ml), was divided into multiple aliquots, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. For experiments, tubes were thawed in a 37 °C water bath and placed on ice until use. Ubiquitination of HMG-CoA Reductase in Permeabilized SV-589 Cells—The protocol used to analyze HMG-CoA reductase ubiquitination in permeabilized cells was adapted from procedures described by the laboratories of Rapoport and Ploegh (17Shamu C.E.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The conditions of incubations prior to harvesting of cells are described in the figure legends. SV-589 cells were harvested into the medium by scraping and collected by centrifugation, after which pooled cell pellets from triplicate dishes were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.9 mm CaCl2. The washed cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of permeabilization buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.3, 115 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm sodium EGTA) containing 0.025% (w/v) digitonin, an ATP-regenerating system (2 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.3, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm ATP, 30 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.05 mg/ml creatine kinase) (19Feldman R.M.R. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), and protease inhibitors (20 μm leupeptin, 10 μm MG-132, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). After rotation for 10 min at 4 °C, the cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 rpm at 4 °C, resuspended in 0.5 ml of permeabilization buffer containing protease inhibitors, the ATP-regenerating system, but no digitonin, and subjected to a second centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 rpm at 4 °C. The resulting pellets of permeabilized cells were then subjected to ubiquitination assays in a final volume of 0.3 ml of permeabilization buffer containing the ATP-regenerating system, 0.1 mg/ml ubiquitin, 0.01 mg/ml ubiquitin-aldehyde, and 30–3000 μg of protein of rat liver cytosol. Sterols were added to reactions in a final concentration of 1% (v/v) ethanol. Typical reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 20–30 min, unless otherwise stated in the figure legends. Reactions were terminated by centrifuging samples at 4,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the resulting cell pellets were lysed in detergent-containing buffer, clarified, and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described below. RNA Interference—Duplexes of small interfering RNA targeting human Insig-1, human Insig-2, and an irrelevant control gene, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO), and RNA interference experiments were carried out as previously described (10Sever N.

HMG-CoA Reductase Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation of HMG-CoA reductase from detergent lysates was carried out with polyclonal antibodies directed against the 60-kDa COOH-terminal domain of human reductase as previously described (10Sever N.

Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9261-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 6% gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting were as follows: IgG-A9 (IgG1), a mouse-monoclonal antibody against the catalytic domain of hamster HMG-CoA reductase (amino acids 450–887) (21Liscum L. Luskey K.L. Chin D.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8450-8455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); IgG-P4D1, a mouse monoclonal antibody against bovine ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); IgG-M2 (IgG2b), a mouse monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope (Sigma); anti-ubiquitin-activating enzyme, rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the COOH terminus of human E1A and E1B (amino acids 1030–1058) (Calbiochem); mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG1) against full-length mouse and human E1 (Covance Research Products); and anti-Hsp90, a mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG1) against amino acids 604–697 of human Hsp90 (Stressgen). To dissect the mechanism for sterol-dependent ubiquitination of HMG-CoA reductase, we began by analyzing the process in a permeabilized cell system. Recent experiments from the laboratories of Ploegh and Rapoport described a permeabilized cell system that recapitulates the ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated destruction of major histocompatibility complex Class I heavy chain molecules induced by the human cytomegalovirus protein US11 (17Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the Ploegh/Rapoport assays, permeabilization was carried out with a low concentration of the mild detergent digitonin, such that the cells retained their subcellular organelle integrity, yet became permeable to molecules such as Trypan blue, ATP, and proteins. In our experiments it was first necessary to deplete cells of sterols so as to assure an abundant supply of nonubiquitinated reductase. For this purpose SV589 cells, a line of SV-40-transformed human fibroblasts, were incubated for 16 h in lipoprotein-deficient serum containing the reductase inhibitor, compactin, and the lowest level of mevalonate (50 μm) that assures viability. Cells were then harvested, washed, and permeabilized with buffer containing a low concentration of digitonin, an ATP-regenerating system, and protease inhibitors to prevent degradation of any ubiquitinated reductase. The samples were subsequently subjected to centrifugation to separate them into supernatant and pellet fractions. The pellet fraction was resuspended in buffer containing the ATP-regenerating system and protease inhibitors, but no digitonin, and re-isolated by centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 1A, the pellet fraction of permeabilized cells contained numerous proteins (lane 4), including reductase (Fig. 1B, top panel, lane 4). Similarly, the supernatant fraction also contained a large number of proteins with a range of molecular masses, as would be expected of cytosolic proteins (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Several proteins that were associated with the pellet fraction of nonpermeabilized cells were absent from that of permeabilized cells, but appeared in the supernatant upon permeabilization (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2–4). This suggests that the majority of cytosolic proteins are released into the supernatant upon permeabilization, and we confirmed this by immunoblotting the fractions with antibodies against two cytosolic proteins: the chaperone Hsp90 and ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). Permeabilization of the cells with digitonin resulted in the complete release of Hsp90 and E1 immunoreactivity into the supernatant fraction after centrifugation (Fig. 1B, bottom two panels). Thus, permeabilization of sterol-depleted SV-589 cells results in the release of a substantial amount of cytosolic proteins into the supernatant fraction after centrifugation while membrane-associated proteins, such as reductase, remain associated with the pellet fraction. We next sought to determine whether the pellet fraction of permeabilized cells could support sterol-regulated ubiquitination of HMG-CoA reductase. The experiment in Fig. 2 shows the basic features of reductase ubiquitination in the permeabilized cell system. Permeabilized SV-589 cells were subjected to in vitro treatments with a mixture of ubiquitin, ubiquitin-aldehyde (to inhibit de-ubiquitinating enzymes) (22Hershko A. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1829-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), an ATP-regenerating system, and rat liver cytosol in the absence or presence of sterols (10 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μg/ml cholesterol) (Fig. 2A). Following incubation at 37 °C for various periods of time, membrane pellets were collected by centrifugation, solubilized in detergent-containing buffer, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies against reductase. The resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin (Fig. 2A, top panel) or anti-reductase (Fig. 2A, lower panel) monoclonal antibodies. Incubation of permeabilized cells with sterols led to the appearance of ubiquitinated reductase in a time-dependent fashion, as indicated by high molecular weight smears in the anti-ubiquitin immunoblots of the reductase immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A, top panel, lanes 3–10). The amount of ubiquitinated reductase rose with time and reached a plateau by 30 min. When cytosol (Fig. 2B, top panel, lanes 1 and 2; Fig. 2C, top panel, lanes 3 and 4) or the ATP-regenerating system (Fig. 2C, top panel, lanes 5 and 6) were omitted from reaction mixtures, no ubiquitinated reductase was observed upon the addition of sterols. Importantly, the amount of immunoprecipitated reductase remained constant throughout the assay, regardless of treatment or time of incubation (lower panels, Fig. 2, A–C). As previously noted in studies of reductase ubiquitination in living cells (10Sever N. Song B.-L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), the anti-reductase immunoblots did not show a smear of ubiquitinated reductase. This suggests that only a small proportion of reductase was ubiquitinated in the in vitro permeabilized cell system as well as the living cell system. Taken together, the results of Fig. 2 demonstrate that reductase ubiquitination in permeabilized cells is stimulated upon the in vitro addition of sterols and the ubiquitination reaction is time- and cytosol-dependent and requires an exogenous source of energy. Fig. 3 shows a competition experiment between ubiquitin containing an NH2-terminal FLAG epitope tag (FLAG-ubiquitin) and untagged ubiquitin for sterol-induced ubiquitination of HMG-CoA reductase in permeabilized SV-589 cells. Permeabilized cell pellets were incubated with increasing amounts of FLAG-ubiquitin in the absence (lanes 1–6) or presence (lanes 7–12) of 20 μm untagged ubiquitin. After incubation for 20 min at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated, and detergent extracts of the permeabilized cells were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-reductase polyclonal antibodies. Anti-FLAG immunoblots revealed sterol-regulated ubiquitination of reductase that increased in parallel with the amount of FLAG-ubiquitin in reaction mixtures (Fig. 3, top panel, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Virtually identical results were observed when the immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-ubiquitin, which recognizes both FLAG-tagged and untagged versions of ubiquitin (middle panel, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Untagged ubiquitin effectively competed with FLAG-ubiquitin for reductase ubiquitination, as indicated by the ablation of immunoreactivity in anti-FLAG immunoblots when reactions contained untagged ubiquitin in addition to FLAG-ubiquitin (top panel, compare lanes 2, 4, and 6 with lanes 8, 10, and 12). These results demonstrate that sterol-dependent ubiquitination of reductase in the permeabilized cell system can be influenced by at least two factors added in vitro: ubiquitin and sterols. We previously demonstrated that a pair of ER membrane proteins, Insig-1 and Insig-2, plays critical roles in sterol-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of HMG-CoA reductase in intact cells (10Sever N. Song B.-L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 11Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To demonstrate their requirement in permeabilized cells, we decreased the amount of Insigs through the use of RNA interference (Fig. 4). SV-589 cells were transfected with duplexes of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting a control mRNA encoding vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G, lanes 1 and 2), which is not present in the cells, or Insig-1 and Insig-2 mRNAs (lanes 3 and 4). Following transfections the cells were permeabilized and subjected to the ubiquitination assay, and detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-reductase antibodies and immunoblotted for FLAG-ubiquitin (upper panel) or reductase (lower panel). In the control cells receiving VSV-G siRNA, sterol treatment caused the appearance of ubiquitinated reductase (upper panel, lane 2). Ubiquitination was greatly diminished in cells transfected with the combination of siRNAs targeting Insig-1 and Insig-2 (upper panel, lane 4). These results demonstrate that Insigs are required for reductase ubiquitination mediated by the in vitro addition of sterols to permeabilized cells. In experiments presented thus far, we used mixtures of 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol to induce HMG-CoA reductase ubiquitination in permeabilized SV-589 cells. The experiment of Fig. 5A shows ubiquitination assays in which 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol were individually added to the reactions. In the absence of cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol stimulated ubiquitination of reductase in a dose-dependent fashion (top panel, lanes 2–5). The addition of cholesterol alone had no significant effect (top gel, lane 6) and did not potentiate the dose-dependent increase in reductase ubiquitination stimulated by 25-hydroxycholesterol (top gel, lanes 7–10). To determine whether other modified sterols could enhance reductase ubiquitination in permeabilized cells, a panel of sterols were added to reactions at concentrations of 10 μg/ml in ethanol (Fig. 5, B and C). Of the oxysterols tested, only 25-hydroxycholesterol, 5-cholesten-3β,16β,27-triol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol stimulated reductase ubiquitination to appreciable levels when added to reactions in ethanol (Fig. 5C; top gel lanes a, c, d, and i, respectively). The possibility exists that the sterol specificity of reductase ubiquitination observed in Fig. 5C reflects differences in the solubilities and/or membrane partition rates among the various sterols tested. To circumvent this problem, we assessed the ability of those ineffective sterols in Fig. 5C to stimulate reductase ubiquitination by adding them in complex with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) rather than from ethanolic solutions (Fig. 5, D–F). A similar procedure was recently used to demonstrate that cholesterol and other structurally related sterols induce a conformational change in SREBP cleavage-activating protein, a sterol-responsive escort protein, when added to isolated ER membranes in vitro (23Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). When added as MβCD complexes, 25-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, and 19-hydroxycholesterol stimulated reductase ubiquitination in the permeabilized cells (Fig. 5, D and F, respectively). The activities of 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol and 19-hydroxycholesterol in MβCD complexes contrasts with their activities in ethanol, and this is likely due to increased membrane partitioning of the sterols as a result of their enhanced delivery from MβCD. It should be noted that cholesterol (Fig. 5, A, C, and F) and certain oxysterols, such as 7β-hydroxycholesterol (Fig. 5, C and D), 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol, and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (Fig. 5, C and E), failed to stimulate ubiquitination of reductase in permeabilized cells regardless of method for sterol delivery. These results are representative of at least two other experiments performed at sterol concentrations of 10 μg/ml. Together, these results demonstrate that reductase ubiquitination in the permeabilized cell system is stimulated by a specific set of oxysterols. Ubiquitination of proteins is carried out through the sequential action of three distinct enzymes: the ubiquitin-activating enzym"
https://openalex.org/W1981644329,"Polar mesospheric clouds are thin layers of nanometer-sized ice particles that occur at altitudes between 82 and 87 kilometers in the high-latitude summer mesosphere. These clouds overlap in altitude with the layer of iron (Fe) atoms that is produced by the ablation of meteoroids entering the atmosphere. Simultaneous observations of the Fe layer and the clouds, made by lidar during midsummer at the South Pole, demonstrate that essentially complete removal of Fe atoms can occur inside the clouds. Laboratory experiments and atmospheric modeling show that this phenomenon is explained by the efficient uptake of Fe on the ice particle surface."
https://openalex.org/W2024104089,"Wza is a highly conserved multimeric outer membrane protein complex required for the surface expression of the serotype K30 group 1 capsular polysaccharide in Escherichia coli. Here we present the first three-dimensional structure of this type of polysaccharide exporter at a 15.5-Å resolution obtained using single particle averaging on a dataset of cryo-negatively stained protein. Previous structural studies on purified Wza have revealed a homo-oligomeric ring structure that is most probably composed of eight subunits.

Escherichia coli produces >80 structurally and immunochemically distinct capsular polysaccharides termed K antigens (1Jann K. Jann B. Sussman M. Escherichia coli: Mechanisms of Virulence. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1997: 113-143Google Scholar). These polymers vary in composition, linkage specificity, and substitution. Capsules are important virulence determinants that enable pathogenic bacteria to evade or counteract the unspecific host defense during the early (preimmune) phase of infection. They also interfere with the action of complement and phagocytes, although this effect is generally transient and overcome by capsule-specific antibodies in the immune phase of the host defense. In some cases, capsules are not immunogenic (or are poorly immunogenic) as a result of a structural mimicry or identity with host material, and these capsule types are correlated with highly virulent isolates. Examples include the group 2 of K1 and K5 serotypes (2Jann K. Jann B. Can. J. Microbiol. 1992; 38: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The capsular K antigens of E. coli are classified into four categories (denoted as groups 1–4) based on their surface organization, their assembly mechanism, the organization of their biosynthetic gene loci, and the regulation of their expression (3Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). However, in terms of their assembly, there are only two pathways used in E. coli, and the capsules of groups 1 and 2 provide the prototypes. Essentially identical pathways are found in other bacterial species (for review see Ref. 3Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In all of the cases, capsular polysaccharides are synthesized at the inner membrane and must be translocated across the outer membrane for final assembly on the cell surface. Group 1 capsules have a relatively low charge density and contain hexuronic acids as acidic components (3Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Group 1 K antigens are found in two forms on the cell surface. Short K-antigenic oligosaccharides are attached to lipid A in a form resembling lipopolysaccharides (5Maclachlan P.R. Keenleyside W.J. Dodgson C. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7515-7522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, high molecular weight polymers forming the capsular structure are not attached to lipid A and are assembled on the cell surface in a translocation pathway independent from lipopolysaccharides (6Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Group 2 capsules have a high charge density and may contain hexuronic acids, N-acetylneuraminic acid, or 2-keto-2-deoxymanno-octulosonic acid as acidic components (2Jann K. Jann B. Can. J. Microbiol. 1992; 38: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Jann K. Jann B. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1987; 9: S517-S526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Group 2 polysaccharides have phosphatidic acid at their reducing termini, and this is thought to act as the surface anchor (8Gotschlich E.C. Fraser B.A. Nishimura O. Robbins J.B. Liu T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8915-8921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schmidt M.A. Jann K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1982; 14: 69-74Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The oligosaccharide repeat units of the group 1 K30 antigen from E. coli (O9a:K30) are assembled on an undecaprenylphosphate carrier, and the glycosyltransferases have been identified (6Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). They are then transferred across the inner membrane by an unknown process involving Wzx and polymerized at the periplasmic face of the membrane by the polymerase Wzy. These proteins are the characteristic components of a Wzy-dependent assembly pathway and are best studied in the assembly of lipopolysaccharide O antigens (reviewed in Ref. 10Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). High level polymerization of group 1 capsular polysaccharide requires phosphorylation of an inner membrane tyrosine autokinase, Wzc (11Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Wzc is dephosphorylated by its cognate phosphatase, Wzb, and this protein is also essential for capsule assembly (11Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Paiment A. Hocking J. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Two outer membrane proteins are involved in K30 assembly. The Wzi β-barrel protein acts late in the assembly process and appears to be involved in surface association (but not synthesis) of capsular polymer, although its exact role is unknown (13Nesper J. Hill C.M.D. Paiment A. Harauz G. Beis K. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49763-49772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Wza proteins are lipoproteins that form multimeric outer membrane complexes that are involved in translocation of the capsular polymer across the outer membrane (6Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Nesper J. Hill C.M.D. Paiment A. Harauz G. Beis K. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. J. Biol.

Group 2 capsules are synthesized by a hetero-oligomeric membrane-bound biosynthetic complex on the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane by the sequential action of glycosyltransferases that elongate the polysaccharide at its non-reducing end (14Finke A. Bronner D. Nikolaev A.V. Jann B. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4088-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Translocation across the inner membrane characteristically requires an ABC-2 (ATP-binding cassette) transporter (3Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol.

D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 60: 558-560Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Negatively stained two-dimensional crystals revealed ringlike multimers with an average outer diameter of ∼9–10 nm and central stain-excluding region of ∼2–3 nm (13Nesper J. Hill C.M.D. Paiment A. Harauz G. Beis K. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49763-49772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Single particle analysis of the same detergent-solubilized material identified a putative C8 rotational symmetry, suggesting that the Wza·His6 complex is octameric (13Nesper J. Hill C.M.D. Paiment A.

At a gross structural level, Wza multimers resemble the secretins such as PilQ (18Collins R.F. Ford R.C. Kitmitto A. Olsen R. Tonjum T. Derrick J.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 183: 3825-3832Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar), pIV (19Alm R.A. Mattick J.S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), PulD (20Nouwen N.

However, these similarities do not extend to the primary sequence features (13Nesper J. Hill C.M.D. Paiment A. Harauz G. Beis K. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, the higher order structural similarities suggest that detailed studies of one protein will provide information on the biology of the other systems. Electron microscopy (EM) 1The abbreviations used are: EM, electron microscopy; FSC, Fourier shell correlation. 1The abbreviations used are: EM, electron microscopy; FSC, Fourier shell correlation. has a particular value for examining large-scale conformation changes within oligomeric protein complexes (23Frank J. Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies. Plenum Press, San Diego1996Crossref Google Scholar). We aim to use EM to investigate how the components interact during polysaccharide export. As the necessary first step, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of native Wza multimers using cryo-negative staining combined with single particle analysis (22Cornelis G.R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 23Frank J. Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies. Plenum Press, San Diego1996Crossref Google Scholar) to 15.5 Å. This technique imparts a higher contrast (for a relatively small complex) than is possible for particles observed by cryo-EM yet retains the advantages of sample preservation (24Adrian M. Dubochet J. Fuller S.D. Harris J.R. Micron. 1998; 2–3: 145-160Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our analysis is the most detailed structural information currently available for this class of exporter protein. Expression and Purification of Wza—The expression and purification procedures that were used to isolate recombinant Wza have been described elsewhere (25Beis K. Nesper J. Whitfield C. Naismith J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 60: 558-560Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cryo-negative Staining—Carbon-coated copper grids (number 400) were inverted on the surface of a 10-μl droplet of Wza (5–10 μg/ml in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 0.008% (w/v) dodecyl-β-maltopyranoside (DDM)) for several minutes and then blotted sequentially for 5 s on a Whatman filter paper until dry. Grids then were placed on a 20-μl droplet of freshly prepared 5 or 10% (w/v) ammonium molybdate, 1% (w/v) trehalose for several seconds, blotted briefly, and immediately frozen to liquid nitrogen temperatures in an Oxford system cryo-stage.

The initial dataset of 2735 Wza particles was selected interactively using either the graphic interfaces of SPIDER (WEB) (26Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar) or EMAN (BOXER) (27Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). The contrast transfer function for each particle in the dataset was determined using the program CRISP (28Hovmöller S. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 41: 121-135Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 29Koronakis V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and corrections for amplitudes and phases were applied using SPIDER. Data then were converted in a format suitable for EMAN (27Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar), and the contrast was normalized. The selected particles were low pass-filtered initially to 10 Å and centered in their boxes relative to a reference-free global average. A set of reference-free class averages then was generated corresponding to Wza positioned in multiple particle orientations. By following established procedures in the EMAN software suite, a preliminary three-dimensional model was determined from class averages that represented distinct views of the Wza complex with a C4 symmetry applied. The relative orientations of the characteristic views were determined using a Fourier common-line routine, and the resulting averages were combined to generate the preliminary three-dimensional model. The three-dimensional structure was refined subsequently using eight rounds of iterative projection matching with each refinement assessed by examining the convergence by comparison of the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of the three-dimensional models generated from each iteration. The final three-dimensional volume was converged fully after eight rounds of iterative refinement. Symmetry Analysis of Wza—Rotational symmetry in volumes was assessed initially in EMAN using STARTCSYM. Unsymmetrized particle averages (with the strongest specified rotational symmetry) were compared with a symmetrized version for consistent projection features and improved SNR. For C4 symmetry, both projections were similar. The assignment of C4 symmetry then was validated independently in SPIDER (23Frank J. Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies. Plenum Press, San Diego1996Crossref Google Scholar) using a variation on rotational power methods and self-orientation analysis (18Collins R.F. Ford R.C. Kitmitto A. Olsen R. Tonjum T. Derrick J.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 183: 3825-3832Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Resolution Determination and Calculation of Variance Maps—Resolution was determined by FSC analysis by comparing the correspondence in reciprocal space of two subaverages generated from half of the final dataset. Using the same subvolumes, a variance map for the final three-dimensional structure was calculated to illustrate the regions of the structure with a high degree of variance (30Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. Hahn M. Ultramicroscopy. 1984; 13: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional Crystallization of Wza and Image Processing— Two-dimensional crystals of Wza were grown using a hanging-droplet method as described previously (31Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and negatively stained with 4% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Electron microscopy was carried out under low dose conditions on a Tecnai 10 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Images were recorded on Kodak SO-163 film and digitized on a UMAX Power Look 3000 densitometer at 9.7 Å/pixel at the specimen level. Lattice unbending and contrast transfer function corrections were applied as described earlier (31Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) using the Medical Research Council UK-Laboratory of Molecular Biology software suite (32Amos L.A. Henderson R. Unwin P.N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1982; 39: 183-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 33Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Projection maps were generated using the CCP4 software (34Bailey A.E. Cannell D.S. Phys. Rev. E Stat. Phys. Plasmas Fluids Relat. Interdiscip. Topics. 1994; 50: 4853-4864PubMed Google Scholar). Cryo-electron Microscopy of Wza—A typical field of view containing cryo-negatively stained Wza multimers within the cryo-preservative staining layer showed complexes positioned in multiple orientations (Fig. 1A). Compared with previous observations of negatively stained Wza single particles (35Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), a variety of views were readily apparent with a lower image contrast compared with the uranyl acetate-stained specimens. The most frequently observed structures were the distinctive high contrast rounded square-shaped projections with an obvious axis of rotational symmetry and variously tilted variations of these views. A rounded, tapering rectangular two-banded projection also was encountered frequently. Two-dimensional projection classification of the particles corresponded to different orientations of the Wza complex with respect to the electron beam as shown in Fig. 1B. This sample of views also demonstrates a good coverage of the three-dimensional space required for projection matching. Rotational Symmetry of the Wza Oligomer—A tetrameric rotational symmetry assignment (C4) was used for calculating subsequent volumes of Wza based on several rationales. First, the observations of the data recorded here in cryo show that the particle top view (positioned above the axis of rotational symmetry) has a distinctive square appearance and suggest that the basic symmetrical element of Wza is tetrameric. Second, previous EM data have suggested that Wza has an octameric organization; however, the calculation of a three-dimensional structure using C8 symmetry (rather than C4 symmetry) produced class averages that were visually dissimilar to the raw data and produced a lower resolution three-dimensional structure, which would not converge properly (data not shown). Equivalent comparisons with other symmetries were only reasonable for C1, C2, and C4 datasets. Fig. 1B shows some of the 85 Wza two-dimensional projection classes and the corresponding back projections from the three-dimensional structure and samples a selection of top, partial, and side views of the complex. Comparing the two-dimensional class averages with the back projections from the final three-dimensional structure showed that there was a clear structural equivalence; this was not apparent in the data refined with C8 symmetry. Third, the volume of the final Wza (Fig. 2) thresholded at 1σ above the mean density was calculated to be 470 Å3 assuming 1.7 Å3/Da–1 (36Harpaz Y. Gerstein M. Chothia C. Structure. 1994; 2: 641-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). This volume could accommodate maximally a protein mass of 276 kDa and is consistent with an oligomer containing eight Wza molecules. Finally, self-rotation peaks from three-dimensional crystal data (17Beis K. Nesper J. Whitfield C. Naismith J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 60: 558-560Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) were calculated using the CCP4 program suite (37P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). The data showed both C4 and C8 rotational peaks as shown in Fig. 1C. These data are all entirely consistent with a complex possessing quasi-symmetry with a C4 rotational axis. In turn, these data strongly suggest that the octameric Wza is a tetramer composed of Wza dimer subunits. Three-dimensional Structure of Wza—Six rounds of angular refinement were applied to 2735 Wza particles to determine the final three-dimensional structure. Surface-rendered representations of the three-dimensional structure of Wza viewed from the bottom, side, and top are shown in Fig. 2A. The Wza complex can be divided into two layers. A larger (115 Å2) layer is located at the top with a smaller (90 Å2) layer at the bottom. Both layers are formed by four tightly associated subunits with no indication of a pore or channels between them at the top and bottom faces. The bottom layer is rotated ∼20° relative to the top layer, giving an overall twist to each subunit in the tetramer. Although the top layer is relatively flat on its upper surface, the lower layer tapers into a rounded tip made up of the four subunits. The side views reveal that these two layers are joined by four bridging densities allowing the 20° rotational twist between the two layers. The complex has an overall height of ∼85 Å in this side view. For scale, this is roughly twice the thickness of an average lipid bilayer. In between the connecting densities (or arms) are four approximately circular holes of ∼35 Å in diameter that connect to a central cavity. This cavity is roughly elliptical in shape and is ∼20 Å in height and 40-Å-wide at the widest points. The extent of the central cavity and its internal features within the complex also are shown in Fig. 3. At this resolution, we are unable to identify monomer units within the structure. Resolution and Variance with the Three-dimensional Structure—Fig. 3A shows the resolution estimation by FSC for the final volume. Here, two separate three-dimensional structures were created from either even- or odd-numbered particles. Hence, each structure represents only 50% of the full dataset. The extent of structural similarity then is compared in Fourier space by correlation analysis (38Radermacher M. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1988; 9: 359-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), and the data are averaged over Fourier shells in three-dimensional reciprocal space to allow a plot of correlation coefficient versus global resolution. Generally, the accepted methods for resolution-limit estimation have recommended that a FSC threshold of 0.5 (38Radermacher M. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1988; 9: 359-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) be employed, although this may be a conservative assessment (39Rosenthal P.B. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 721-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). An FSC threshold of 0.5 provides a resolution estimate of 15.5 Å for the Wza structure consistent with the three-dimensional variance map analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, some small regions of high variance (rendered at 3σ above the mean variance) are well outside the periphery of the molecule. This is probably because of a lack of consistency in staining. At the bottom of the “arm” densities connecting the top and bottom layers, there is evidence of high variance within the protein density and this may reflect flexibility of the subunits in this region. The three regions of high variance along the 4-fold axis of rotational symmetry (dashed line) are intriguing and are potentially indicative of conformational flexibility that would be necessary to open a polymer translocation pore in the membrane. In this respect, the top and bottom layers behave differently with the top layer showing a high variance at the center of the layer, whereas the bottom layer displays a low variance in the center. Two-dimensional Crystals of Wza—The structural analysis and interpretation presented above were verified independently using an electron crystallographic approach. Two-dimensional crystals of the detergent-solubilized Wza complex were obtained using a hanging-droplet method (31Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and Fig. 4A shows an image of typical crystals after negative staining. The crystals are composed mostly of single layers of Wza molecules, but occasional patches with two or more overlapping layers can be observed (arrows in Fig. 4A). In addition, small defects in the crystal lattice were observed (boxed/zoomed area) where Wza particles in different orientations were incorporated into the crystal. Fig. 4B shows a computed Fourier transform of a well ordered area of the Wza crystal subjected to three rounds of lattice unbending. The transform shows systematic absences along the (h,0) axis, indicative of a screw axis along the crystallographic a direction. The calculated projection map (Fig. 3C) (with no crystallographic symmetry applied) shows two Wza tetramers in the unit cell offering further support for the presence of a screw axis. It seems probable that the crystals form in the P121 plane group with the two Wza tetramers in the unit cell alternately being oriented facing upward and downwards. Because there is some differential staining of the two sides of the crystal, there is a significant deviation from a perfect P121 relationship. This provides one explanation as to why one of the Wza tetramers appears to be slightly smaller in projection. Presumably, this molecule has its smaller (90 Å2) layer more contrasted by stain, and hence, this contributes more to its projection. The overall size and shape of each molecule in the unit cell is consistent with the single particle averaging described above. Each molecule is ∼120 Å2 with a central stain pocket of 30–40 Å in diameter. There is no indication from this crystallographic study of an 8-fold symmetry signal, in agreement with the application of C4 symmetry for the single particle averaging procedures. Fig. 4, panels D and E, shows the two molecules in the unit cell after the application of non-crystallographic 4-fold symmetry Three-dimensional Structure of Oligomeric Wza—The mushroom-like Wza-multimeric complex is divided into two discrete layers and appears to be formed by eight monomers with 4-fold rotational symmetry, suggesting a tetramer of dimers. A similar architecture and C4 symmetry have been observed in other membrane proteins, e.g. the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (40da Fonseca P.C. Morris S.A. Nerou E.P. Taylor C.W. Morris E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3936-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and the Shaker channel (41Sokolova O. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Grigorieff N. Structure. 2001; 9: 215-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), although in the Shaker channel, the lower ring shows a smoother surface relief and has a pronounced funnel shape. In these examples, the structural data show that the larger ring is observed in the membrane-embedded portion of these structures. By analogy, we would suggest that the larger ring of the Wza complex is embedded in the membrane. The detailed structure provided by this study also allows some structural comparison between Wza and the protein export “superfamily” secretins and highlights some important differences. PilQ from Neisseria meningitidis forms a large (∼1 MDa) oligomeric outer membrane complex that is responsible for the extrusion and subsequent retraction of adhesive-type IV pili. Similar to Wza, the PilQ secretin also is C4-symmetric and both PilQ and Wza complexes have four arms that project from the bottom layer, twisting around a central cavity and meeting to form a closed dome-shaped “cap” on the top of the complex. However, the overall dimensions and internal cavity of PilQ are considerably larger than Wza, and the complex is probably formed from 12 monomers rather than eight. When viewed from the side, PilQ also has a three-layered structure. The internal cavity of PilQ is also almost completely sealed on all of the sides, whereas the cavity of Wza has access channels. The pIV multimer, which secretes filamentous bacteriophage, has 14 monomers in a distinct three-band structure similar to PilQ. However, the central cavity of pIV (60–88 Å in diameter) is cut in two by the central (M) ring of the complex (42Opalka N. Beckmann R. Boisset N. Simon M.N. Russel M. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast to Wza multimers, the pIV-oligomeric structure shows a channel opening at each end, perhaps connecting the periplasm and external milieu. The modeling of the PulD secretin revealed a C12-symmetrical cylindrical structure with a continuous and open channel visible through the entire length of the protein complex. Although clearly visible under the conditions of the EM experiment, conductance measurements indicate that the pore is gated (43Nouwen N. Ranson N. Saibil H. Wolpensinger B. Engel A. Ghazi A. Pugsley A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8173-8177Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, transmission electron microscopy analysis of proteolytically digested PulD suggests that the three-dimensional structure may be more similar to that of pIV (20Nouwen N. Stahleberg H. Pugsley A.P. Engel A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Oligomeric Arrangement of Wza—Quasi-symmetry is well characterized for viral capsid proteins but has been observed relatively infrequently for other oligomeric assemblies. Notably, quasi-symmetry is a feature of membrane and membrane-associated protein complexes such as PilQ 2R. F. Collins and R. C. Ford, unpublished data. The PspA AAA+ adaptor protein assembly forms a C9-symmetric ring associated with the inner membrane (44Hankamer B.D. Elderkin S.L. Buck M. Nield J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8862-8866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the complex is ∼1 MDa and suggests that each of the nine rotational units is a tetramer. The structural significance of these quasi-symmetrical arrangements is unclear, but the symmetry mismatch has a functional significance because the export substrates typically will have either no symmetry or a different symmetry compared with the exporter itself. Implications for K Antigen Synthesis—In the working model for group 1 capsule translocation, the large ring of the Wza multimer is membrane-embedded. Because its depth almost exactly matches the thickness of the membrane, it would be occluded completely. Consequently, our prediction is that the entire smaller ring is exposed in the periplasm. An alternative positioning of the complex in the membrane would require the side openings to be inside the lipid bilayer, although this seems unlikely. The structure is entirely consistent with a model in which Wza interacts with K antigen synthesis components located at the inner membrane. Preliminary biochemical evidence suggests protein-protein interaction with the inner membrane protein Wzc (13Nesper J. Hill C.M.D. Paiment A. Harauz G. Beis K. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49763-49772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This would be similar to the interactions of secretins (such as MxiD) with the inner membrane components in type III needle complex structures (45Allaoui A. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 46Blocker A. Jouihri N. Larquet E. Gounon P. Ebel F. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. Allaoui A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 652-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). There is an obvious analogy to the AcrAB-TolC drug efflux pump from E. coli (47Nikaido H. Zgurskaya H.I. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 215-218PubMed Google Scholar). The TolC can be coupled to either an ABC transporter or an antiporter depending on the export substrate (4Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 48Andersen C. Hughes C. Koronakis V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 49Andersen C. Hughes C. Koronakis V. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 50Thanabalu T.

Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The Wza system does not require an ABC transporter for translocation of the K antigen. The Wza multimeric structure shows the complex being closed to the external environment, but access to the complex cavity may be achieved via the “side” holes from the periplasm. It may be that this is the entry point for the capsular polysaccharide with the exit point existing through the middle of one of the two rings. We have proposed already that it is the large ring that is inserted in the membrane, making this the exit point in the hypothetical model. Under the conditions used for preparation and electron microscopy, the structures show no open channel through this ring. However, because both Wza and secretins act as substrate-specific portals across the outer membrane, it appears that we are observing the closed form of Wza multimers. In order for the substrate to thread through Wza, the membrane-embedded layer would have to open up. Given that the Wza substrate is large (100 kDa), this would require significant conformational change in the upper ring. As discussed above, the experimental data suggested that there was indeed some flexibility in the larger (but not smaller) ring, consistent with our hypothesis for opening and closing of the larger ring. This gating may be triggered either by substrate or interaction with another protein. One candidate is Wzc, a protein that can be cross-linked to Wza in a higher order complex (13Nesper J.

https://openalex.org/W1966722475,"The eukaryotic SMC1/SMC3 heterodimer is essential for sister chromatid cohesion and acts in DNA repair and recombination. Dimerization depends on the central hinge domain present in all SMC proteins, which is flanked at each side by extended coiled-coil regions that terminate in specific globular domains. Here we report on DNA interactions of the eukaryotic, heterodimeric SMC1/SMC3 hinge regions, using the two known isoforms, SMC1α/SMC3 and the meiotic SMC1β/SMC3. Both dimers bind DNA with a preference for double-stranded DNA and DNA rich in potential secondary structures. Both dimers form large protein-DNA networks and promote reannealing of complementary DNA strands. DNA binding but not dimerization depends on approximately 20 amino acids of transitional sequence into the coiled-coil region. Replacement of three highly conserved glycine residues, thought to be required for dimerization, in one of the two hinge domains still allows formation of a stable dimer, but if two hinge domains are mutated dimerization fails. Single-mutant dimers bind DNA, but hinge monomers do not. Together, we show that eukaryotic hinge dimerization does not require conserved glycines in both hinge domains, that only the transition into the coiled-coil region rather than the entire coiled-coil region is necessary for DNA binding, and that dimerization is required but not sufficient for DNA binding of the eukaryotic hinge heterodimer.

Eukaryotic SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) proteins are essential for sister chromatid cohesion and proper chromosome condensation and also act in response to DNA damage, in DNA recombination and repair, and in gene dosage compensation (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Cobbe N.

SMC proteins, which are between 120 and 160 kDa in molecular mass, feature a design reminiscent of motor proteins. The C-terminal and N-terminal globular domains are separated by extended coiled-coil regions and a hinge domain at the center. Six members of the eukaryotic SMC protein family are known, named SMC1–SMC6 for most eukaryotic organisms. They form three types of heterodimers: SMC1/SMC3, SMC2/SMC4, and SMC5/SMC6. One heterodimer each constitutes a core component of a larger multiprotein complex that acts in one of the key functions described for SMC proteins. The best described complexes are cohesin (7Guacci V. Koshland D. Strunnikov A. Cell. 1997; 91: 47-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 8Michaelis C. Ciosk R.

Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The SMC5/SMC6 heterodimer forms a multiprotein complex that acts in postreplicative recombinational repair of DNA damage (12Lehmann A.R. Walicka M. Griffiths D.J.F. Murray J.M. Watts F.Z. McCready S. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7067-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 13Fousteri M.I. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Also, there are several other complexes such as a mammalian complex called RC-1, which has been implicated in DNA recombination and repair reactions (14Jessberger R. Podust V. Hübscher U. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Jessberger R. Riwar B. Baechtold H. Akhmedov A.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4061-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), a DNA damage response-dependent complex that forms upon phosphorylation of SMC1 (16Kim S.T. Xu B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 560-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 17Yazdi P.T. Wang Y. Zhao S. Patel N. Lee E.Y. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), and a gene dosage compensation complex in Caenorhabditis elegans that contains SMC2 and SMC4 homologs and is responsible for maintaining the same level of X chromosome expression in XX and XO animals (18Chuang P.T. Albertson D.G. Meyer B.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 459-474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In meiotic cells, there exist at least two, probably more, meiosis-specific SMC protein complexes. Two isoforms of SMC1 have been described: the canonical SMC1α found in mitotic and meiotic cells and the meiosis-specific SMC1β (19Revenkova E. Eijpe M. Heyting C. Gross B. Jessberger R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6984-6998Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Overall these two SMC1 isoforms are approximately 50% identical in amino acid sequence and differ at their C terminus where SMC1β possesses an extension. The hinge domain amino acid sequences are 61% identical. Both SMC1 isoforms heterodimerize with SMC3. Key to all well described functions of SMC proteins is their interaction with DNA. The large SMC complexes show distinct DNA modulating activities. The holocomplex condensin introduces positive supercoil into relaxed circular DNA in an ATP-dependent, topoisomerase I-dependent reaction (20Kimura K. Hirano T. Cell. 1997; 90: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 21Hagstrom K.A. Holmes V.F. Cozzarelli N.R. Meyer B.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In the presence of topoisomerase II nicked circular DNA is converted into knotted structures, and an ordered, global writhe is introduced in the DNA (20Kimura K. Hirano T. Cell. 1997; 90: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 22Kimura K. Rybenkov V.V. Crisona N.J. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Based on imaging of the ATP-dependent supercoil reaction of condensin, a model was suggested in which the globular head domains of condensin wrap around approximately 190 bp of DNA and thereby create two compensatory supercoils at a remote site (23Bazett-Jones D.P. Kimura K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1183-1190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, condensin has the potential to intramolecularly fold DNA and thereby to contribute to chromosome condensation in metaphase. Cohesin aggregates DNA and promotes topoisomerase II-dependent intermolecular catenation of circular DNA substrates (24Losada A Hirano T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 268-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cohesin has been suggested to embrace DNA, i.e. two newly synthesized sister chromatids, in a ring-like structure, thereby ensuring sister chromatid cohesion (25Haering C.H. Löwe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 26Gruber S. Haering C.H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2003; 112: 765-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The ring is formed largely by the SMC1/SMC3 dimer and is closed by two non-SMC proteins that interact with the terminal domains of the SMC proteins. The points of contact, if any, between the cohesin ring and the DNA are not known. The possibility exists that the cohesin ring interacts with the sister chromatids mainly topologically rather than by protein-DNA binding. However, SMC proteins are known to bind DNA, at least in vitro. Individual C-terminal but not N-terminal domains from a variety of yeast and higher eukaryotic SMC proteins, and one coiled-coil region from mammalian SMC3, were found to bind DNA, preferentially double-stranded (ds) 1The abbreviations used are: ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay(s); TR, transitional region. substrates that contain palindromic sequences, potentially form stem-loop structures, or are A/T-rich (27Akhmedov A.T.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed preferential association of cohesins with centromeric and A/T-rich regions (29Blat Y. Kleckner N.

Also, the purified SMC1/SMC3 heterodimer possesses DNA-stimulated ATPase activity and reanneals complementary single strands of DNA (15Jessberger R. Riwar B. Baechtold H. Akhmedov A.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4061-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). More recently, DNA binding was reported for a homodimeric prokaryotic SMC protein fragment that contains the hinge domain and almost the entire coiled-coil regions. Deleting the coiled-coil region from the molecule rendered the hinge dimer inactive in electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) (32Hirano M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5733-5744Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The hinge domain is thought to lend flexibility to the two-armed structure of SMC molecules and is characterized by four highly conserved glycine residues that are typical of flexible regions in a protein and may disrupt α-helical structures (33Hirano M. Anderson D.E. Erickson H.P. Hirano T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3238-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence is GX6GX3GG for eukaryotic proteins and GX5GGX3GG for prokaryotes. Mutating the C-terminal four of the five glycines abolished the ability of the Bacillus subtitlis SMC protein to form a homodimer and to bind DNA (32Hirano M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5733-5744Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 33Hirano M. Anderson D.E. Erickson H.P. Hirano T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3238-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The importance of the hinge domain for SMC dimerization was also demonstrated in an analysis of the crystal structure of a prokaryotic hinge region and of interactions of hinge regions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Smc1p and Smc3p (25Haering C.H. Löwe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Individual S. cerevisiae Smc1p/Smc3p heterodimer, overexpressed in insect cells, showed predominantly the V shape. Differently tagged S. cerevisiae Smc1p or Smc3p hinge domain mutants were used in pull-down assays to study their dimerization behavior. This study revealed that for dimerization no hinge region can be replaced by another and that the hinge regions cannot be replaced by a short, unrelated peptide (25Haering C.H. Löwe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of the Thermotoga maritima hinge homodimer showed that it acquires a ring or doughnut-shaped structure with the N and C termini all facing one side (Ref. 25Haering C.H. Löwe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). Thus, the adjacent coiled-coil regions of one hinge region enter and leave the doughnut structure on the same side. This restrains the flexibility of the SMC dimer arms, making it more likely for the dimeric molecule to adopt a V-shaped structure rather than a completely opened, rod-like structure. V-shaped structures were most frequently observed in electron microscopy experiments (25Haering C.H. Löwe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 34Melby T.E. Ciampaglio C.N. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 35Anderson D.E. Losada A. Erickson H.P. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The T. maritima hinge dimer has two interaction domains on each monomer (25Haering C.H. Löwe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). These domains are formed by short β-sheets and several α-helices, two of which are involved in dimer interactions (Fig. 1). Thus, two interaction surfaces exist between the two half-rings that form the doughnut. Because the conserved glycines are in close proximity to the amino acids that directly interact, it is thought that mutating these glycines disrupts the structure of the interaction surface. In a homodimer, this would affect both interaction surfaces, and the ring would fall apart, as shown for the B. subtilis SMC (33Hirano M. Anderson D.E. Erickson H.P. Hirano T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3238-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For the eukaryotic heterodimer it is unclear whether both interaction surfaces are required (Fig. 1). Given the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic SMC dimers, notably the heterodimerization found in eukaryotes, a number of questions remain to be answered: (i) Do eukaryotic heterodimers need to dimerize for DNA interaction as seen for the prokaryotic homodimers? (ii) Are intact coiled-coil regions required for dimerization and for DNA binding of the hinge dimer? (iii) Are the highly conserved Gly residues in the eukaryotic hinge regions of the same functional importance as in their prokaryotic homodimeric counterparts? (iv) Are two intact interaction surfaces required for stable dimerization? (v) Do the hinge dimers display specificity in DNA binding, and are they active in DNA single-stranded reannealing? This study aims at addressing these questions. In addition, characterization of DNA interactions of hinge dimers reveals that stable dimerization requires only one intact hinge-hinge interface and that not the coiled-coil region per se but rather a short transitional region into the coiled-coil region is required for hinge dimerization and DNA binding. Cloning and Expression of Hinge Proteins—The wild-type SMC1 hinge domain contains amino acids 481–674 of bovine SMC1 (accession number AAD13141). The corresponding DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using a cDNA clone (36Stursberg S. Riwar B. Jessberger R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with primer 1 (5′-AAA ATT CCA TAT GGA ACA ACT AGG AGA TGC C-3′) and primer 2 (5′-AAA AAG CGG CCG CTC ACA ACT TGT CTA CTG CTT TC-3′). In codons 2–4 the nucleotide in the third position was changed from G to A. Primer 2 introduces a stop codon in the end of the hinge domain coding sequence. The fragment was digested with restriction endonucleases NdeI and NotI and inserted between the NdeI and NotI sites of pET-21a(+) (Novagen). The resulting plasmid was digested with NotI, and the ends were filled in with Klenow polymerase and religated. This procedure places the His6 tag encoded by pET-21a(+) out of the SMC1 hinge protein open reading frame to avoid any possible expression of a tagged peptide by the suppression of the stop codon. To express a tagged version of the SMC1 hinge domain, pET-29a(+) (Novagen Inc.) was modified by insertion of a double-stranded oligonucleotide, which encodes His6 tag followed by a stop codon. The double-stranded oligonucleotide was generated by annealing two single-stranded oligonucleotides, 5′-GAT CCC ATC ATC ACC ATC ACC ATT CAG C-3′ and 5′-GGC CGC TCA ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG ATG G-3′. The oligonucleotide was inserted between the BamHI and NotI sites of pET-29a(+) to generate pET-29-GSHis6. A DNA sequence encoding SMC1 hinge was amplified by PCR using primer 1 and primer 3: 5′-AGC TGG ATC CGC CCA ACT TGT CTA CTG CTT TC-3′. The fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-29-GSHis6. In the encoded peptide the SMC1 hinge domain is separated from the His6 tag by a flexible linker, Gly-Gly-Ser. The SMC1 hinge domain lacking the TR contains amino acids 504–659 of bovine SMC1. The corresponding DNA sequence was amplified by PCR using primer 4 (5′-AAA AAA AAA ACA TAT GGA AAG CAT CAA GCG CCT G-3′) and primer 5 (5′-AAA AAG CGG CCG CTC ACA GGT CAC TGG CCC-3′), which introduces a stop codon. The fragment was inserted into pET-21a(+) by the same procedure as used for the wild-type SMC1 hinge protein. In the SMC1GGG hinge mutant, the glycine residues in positions 650, 654, and 655 of bovine SMC1 were replaced by alanine. To introduce the mutations into the SMC1 cDNA, two overlapping fragments were amplified by PCR, fragment 1 with the primers P1 (5′-GGC CCT GCA GTA TGC TTG TGG C-3′) and P2Mut (5′-AGC GGC AGA GAT CAC GGC TGA CTT CTG G-3′) and fragment 2 with the primers P3Mut (5′-GCC GTG ATC TCT GCC GCT GCC AGT GAC C-3′) and P4 (5′-GGT CTG TTC TAG GTC ACT CTG TG-3′). Fragments 1 and 2 were purified, mixed together, and used to amplify by PCR a mutagenized fragment using the primers P1 and P4. The fragment was digested with SanD1 and BsgI and used to replace the corresponding SanDI-BsgI fragment of the bovine SMC1 cDNA. The mutagenized clone was used to amplify and clone the sequence encoding the hinge domain using the same procedure as for the wild-type SMC1 hinge. Wild-type SMC3 hinge domain contains amino acids 484–690 of bovine SMC3 (accession number AAD13142) preceded by Met and followed by a Gly-Ser linker and a His6 tag. The DNA fragment was amplified using SMC3 cDNA clone (36Stursberg S. Riwar B. Jessberger R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with primer 6 (5′-AAA AAA AAA CAT ATG GCT GCT AAA AGA GAA-3′) and primer 7 (5′-AGC TGG ATC CGC CAC CAA GTT CTT CTT CCG-3′). SMC3 TR- protein contains amino acids 504–669 of bovine SMC3 preceded by Met and followed by a Gly-Gly-Ser linker and a His6 tag. The DNA fragment was amplified using primer 8 (5′-AAA AAA AAC ATA TGG CCA TTT TAA ATG GAA TAG-3′) and primer 9 (5′-AGCTGGATCCGCCATAATAGCCTCCAGTC-3′). The fragments encoding the wild-type or SMC3 TR- hinge protein were inserted into the pET-29-GSHis6 by the same procedure as used for the His-tagged SMC1 hinge plasmid. In the SMC3GGG mutant, alanine was substituted for glycine in bovine SMC3 positions 662, 666, and 667. To introduce the mutations the fragment encoding the wild-type SMC3 hinge inserted into pET-29-GSHis6 was used as a template. Two overlapping fragments were amplified by PCR, fragment 3 using primer P5 (5′-GAG GTA CAA TCC CAG ATT TGA C-3′) and primer P6Mut (5′-AGC GGC AGT CAA AGC GGC TCG ATG AC-3′) and fragment 4 using primer P7Mut (5′-CCG CTT TGA CTG CCG CTT ATT ATG ATA-3′) and primer 7. Fragments 3 and 4 were purified, mixed together, and used to amplify by PCR a mutagenized fragment using the primers P5 and 7. The fragment was digested with HindIII and BamHI and used to replace the corresponding fragment in the wild-type SMC3 hinge clone. For the expression of the wild-type SMC3 protein without a tag, a DNA fragment encoding amino acids 484–690 was amplified using primer 6 and primer 10 (5′-AAA AAG CGG CCG CTC AAC CAA GTT CTT CTT CGC-3′) and inserted into pET-21a(+) as described for the wild-type SMC1 hinge plasmid. SMC1β hinge protein contains amino acids 482–674 of mouse SMC1β (accession number AAL09333) preceded by Met. The corresponding DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using primer 11 (5′-AAA ATT GCA TAT GGA ATT CGA GAA TGC TGG-3′) and primer 12 (5′-AAA AAG CGG CCG CTC ATA GAT TGT GTA ACT CTT TC-3′). The fragment was inserted into pET-21a (+) as described for the wild-type SMC1 clone. All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing of the entire insert. All of the proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21-CodonPlus-RIL (Stratagene). The clones were grown to early log phase in LB containing the appropriate antibiotics and 20 mm glucose. Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mm and further growth for 2–3 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in buffer L (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 800 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and were incubated on ice for 30 min with 1 mg/ml lysozyme, followed by one freeze-thaw cycle in liquid nitrogen. The viscous lysate was centrifuged (40,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C, Ti-45 rotor), and the cleared supernatant was loaded at 4 °C onto 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen Inc.). The flow-through was collected, and the resin was washed with 5 mm imidazole in buffer L, followed by stepwise elution with 20, 50, and 250 mm imidazole in buffer L. The proteins were dialyzed against 2× 1 liter of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 10% glycerol, 0.05 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the protease inhibitor mixture. The protein fractions were stored at -80 °C. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—These assays were performed as described earlier (19Revenkova E. Eijpe M. Heyting C. Gross B. Jessberger R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6984-6998Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 27Akhmedov A.T. Frei C. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Kemper B. Gasser S.M. Jessberger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24088-24094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30-μl reaction mixtures containing 0.5–1 ng (3000–6000 cpm) of 32P 5′-labeled DNA in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and protein as indicated. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis at 4 °C in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA. All of the gels were fixed (60 min in 10% acetic acid, 10% ethanol), dried, and exposed for autoradiography. Radioactively labeled DNA substrate was a 200-bp EcoRI 5 S rDNA fragment excised from an array of 11 head-to-tail repeats (37Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This fragment bears palindromic sequences and was found earlier to be efficiently bound by SMC protein domains. The following DNA substrates were used as competitors: a 230-bp EcoRI-KasI M13mp18 DNA fragment (bp 6001–6231), a 232-bp AvaII fragment from pUC19 (bp 1837–2059), a 340-bp human centromeric DNA fragment from chromosome 17 (38Warburton P.E. Willard H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and full-length ss or ds M13mp18 DNA. Reannealing and Protein-DNA Network Formation Assays—Complementary DNA strands used in the assay were obtained by heat denaturation of the 32P 5′-labeled 200-bp dsDNA fragment described above as gel shift assay substrate. The reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.13 μm (nucleotides) heat-denatured 200-bp 32P DNA fragment and various amounts of protein. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the reactions were stopped by addition of 0.1 volume of 10% SDS, 100 μg/ml proteinase K, incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and analyzed by electrophoresis in 5% polyacrylamide, 0.2% bis-acrylamide gels and autoradiography. The assay for network formation was done as described for RecA (39Chow S.A. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5646-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and mammalian DNA-binding proteins (19Revenkova E. Eijpe M. Heyting C. Gross B. Jessberger R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6984-6998Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 40Ganea D. Moore P. Chekuri L. Kucherlapati R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3124-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The assay measures coaggregation of DNA into DNA-protein complexes that sediment rapidly. The DNA substrate was the 32P 5′-labeled 200-bp rDNA fragment. Various amounts of protein were incubated in a volume of 50 μl with the DNA (2.5 fmol) for 20 min at room temperature in the DNA binding buffer also used for gel shift experiments. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged for 3 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was transferred into a scintillation vial, and the pellet was solubilized in 100 μl of 0.1% SDS and also transferred into a scintillation vial. The assay was done in triplicates, and supernatant (nonaggregated) and pellet (aggregated) DNA were measured. Dimer Stability Assay—In one procedure, the purified hinge dimer was incubated and rotated with 30 μl of nickel resin in a low salt buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with the same buffer and then incubated for 30 min with stepwise increasing NaCl or increasing SDS in the same buffer. Supernatants were taken at each step, and the beads were washed at the same NaCl or SDS concentration between steps. The samples were then analyzed for the presence of the untagged SMC hinge domain by SDS gel electrophoresis and silver staining. The NaCl or SDS concentration at which the untagged domain dissociated from the bead-bound, His-tagged partner was taken as a comparative indicator for stability of the various dimer proteins. Alternatively, hinge dimers present in E. coli lysates made in the presence of different NaCl concentrations, up to 1.5 m, were directly bound to nickel beads, the beads were washed with the same buffer, and the bound material was eluted with imidazole (250 mm) and analyzed as above. The results were the same for both procedures. Purification and Dimerization of SMC1/SMC3 Hinge Proteins—Hinge monomers or dimers were purified from E. coli by nickel resin chromatography, followed by dialysis. All of the dimers contained only one monomer tagged with His6, the SMC3 monomer (Fig. 2A), which was generally expressed at lower levels than the SMC1 partner. In control experiments, the tag was present on the SMC1 hinge domain with the same experimental results. No monomers were found in dimer preparations, and the stoichiometry in a dimer, based on Coomassie or silver staining, was 1: 1. All wild-type or mutant hinge dimers were soluble under native lysis conditions (Fig. 2). For wild-type dimers, the SMC1α/SMC3 (1α/3) and the SMC1β/SMC3 (1β/3) hinge domain dimers were purified (Fig. 2, B and D). Three glycines that correspond to the four glycines shown to be required for dimerization in B. subtitlis SMC (32Hirano M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5733-5744Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) were mutated in two constructs by alanine substitution as indicated in Fig. 2A. Dimeric molecules that contain one mutated monomer (1αGGG/3 or 1α/3GGG, indicating the three glycines mutated) still formed dimers that could be purified under the same conditions as wild type (Fig. 2, C and F). If two mutants were coexpressed (1αGGG/3GGG), no dimer was found, and only the monomeric 3GGG was bound to the nickel resin, although the 1αGGG protein was strongly expressed and present in the native lysate (Fig. 2G). Thus, one intact interaction domain is required for dimerization. The hinge domains contain approximately 20 amino acids at each terminus that represent the transition into the adjacent coiled-coil regions (TR; Fig. 2A). With increasing distance from the hinge domain, the probability of coiled-coil formation, as determined by the COILS v. 2.1 program, increases. For example, in the SMC1α hinge domain, the probability to acquire a coiled-coil structure, derived from the 21-residue window of the program, is at 0.99 for the eight distal amino acids, conti"
https://openalex.org/W1977097697,"Pathway optimization is difficult to achieve owing to complex, nonlinear, and largely unknown interactions of enzymes, regulators, and metabolites. We report a pathway reconstruction using RNA display–derived messenger RNA–enzyme fusion molecules. These chimeras are immobilized by hybridization of their messenger RNA end with homologous capture DNA spotted on a substrate surface. Enzymes thus immobilized retain activity proportional to the amount of capture DNA, allowing modulation of the relative activity of pathway enzymes. Entire pathways can thus be reconstructed and optimized in vitro from genomic information. We provide concept validation with the sequential reactions catalyzed by luciferase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase and further illustrate this method with the optimization of the five-step pathway for trehalose synthesis."

In contrast, natural ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) display protective anti-cytokine effects in these cells. We used the PPAR agonist rosiglitazone (Rtz) to investigate PPAR-γ isotype on IL-1β-target genes. Immunocytochemistry, electrophoretic mobility shift, and transient transfection assays revealed a functional PPAR-γ in chondrocytes in vitro. Rtz displayed significant inhibition of IL-1β effects in chondrocytes. Low Rtz concentrations (close to Kd values for PPAR-γ, 0.1 to 1 μm) inhibited the effects of IL-1β on 35S-sulfated proteoglycan production and gelatinolytic activities and downregulated MMP1 expression at mRNA and protein levels. We have investigated the mechanism of action of Rtz against IL-1β-mediated MMP1 gene hyperexpression. Rtz effect occurs at the transcriptional level of the MMP1 promoter, as observed in transiently transfected cells with pMMP1-luciferase vector. Transient expression of wild type PPAR-γ enhanced Rtz inhibitory effect in chondrocytes, whereas a mutated dominant negative PPAR-γ abolished it, supporting the role of PPAR-γ in this effect. MMP1 gene promoter analysis revealed the involvement of a cis-acting element located at -83 to -77, shown to be a composite PPRE/AP1 site. Gel mobility and supershift assays demonstrated that PPAR-γ and c-Fos/c-Jun proteins bind this cis-acting element in a mutually exclusive way.

Intra-articular injection of 15d-PGJ2 inhibits adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats (1Kawahito Y. Kondo M. Tsubouchi Y. Hashiramoto A. Bishop-Bailey D. Inoue K. Kohno M. Yamada R. Hla T. Sano H. J.

As IL-1β plays a central role in the degradation of cartilage in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis (5Henderson B. Pettipher E.R. Clin. Exp.

Immunol. 1992; 89: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the above data suggest a role for PPAR-γ in cartilage homeostasis leading to new directions in therapeutic research. PPAR-γ is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. PPAR-γ forms a heterodimeric complex with the retinoid X receptor (7Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3057) Google Scholar) and binds to specific nucleotide motifs (direct repeats with single spacing, DR1) located in the promoter of target genes. Natural ligands such as 15d-PGJ2 have been shown to activate PPAR-γ, yet the true physiological ligands of this receptor remain elusive. Numerous synthetic PPAR-γ activators have been identified, including thiazolidinediones (such as rosiglitazone (Rtz)) used in the treatment of type II diabetes (8Willson T.M. Lambert M.H. Kliewer S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 341-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). PPAR-γ was first demonstrated to regulate adipocyte differentiation, and it has been recognized recently (9Lapillonne H. Konopleva M. Tsao T. Gold D. McQueen T. Sutherland R.L. Madden T. Andreeff M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5926-5939PubMed Google Scholar) to be implicated in the modulation of cancer cells growth and inhibition of the inflammatory process in immunocompetent cells (10Jiang C.

Most anti-inflammatory effects have been observed with 15d-PGJ2, a poor agonist of PPAR-γ, whereas synthetic PPAR-γ ligands such as Rtz were less effective or not active, despite their higher affinity for the receptor (Rtz Kd ≤ 100 nm). Thus, the question regarding the exact role and the implication of PPAR-γ in these effects has been largely discussed and documented in cells from the immune system. Overexpression of PPAR-γ in macrophages maximized the ability of diverse PPAR-γ agonists to inhibit the expression of inflammatory response genes consistent with a PPAR-γ-mediating anti-inflammatory mechanism (15Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Willson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 16Daynes R.A. Jones D.C. Nat.

Similar data were observed in the RAW 264.7 macrophages (18Straus D.S. Pascual G. Li M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.H. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Ghosh G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, the role of Rtz-activated PPAR-γ as an antagonist of IL-1β-induced cartilage degradation is largely unknown. The aim of this work was to analyze this role through the effects of the hypolipidemic drug rosiglitazone on IL-1β-induced target genes active in the degradative process of matrix proteins synthesized by culture chondrocytes. We report a PPAR-γ-dependent inhibitory mechanism on IL-1β-induced MMP1 expression acting through a new composite PPRE/AP-1 site at positions -83 to -71 upstream from the MMP1 rabbit gene transcription start site. Isolation and Culture of Chondrocytes from Rabbit Articular Cartilage—Articular chondrocytes were cultured as described previously (21Corvol M.T. Dumontier M.F. Rappaport R. Biomedicine (Paris). 1975; 23: 103-107PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5-week-old Fauve de Bourgogne rabbits (CPA, Orleans, France) were killed, and the femoral, humeral, and tibial articular cartilages were removed under sterile conditions. Thin slices of cartilage were sequentially digested with 0.2% hyaluronidase and 0.2% collagenase in Geys' balanced salt solution (Eurobio, Les Ulis France). The resulting cell suspension was plated at 105 cells per cm2 (high density) into 75-cm2 flasks or 6-well plates and incubated in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were then cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 8% CO2 in air, and the medium was changed once until the cells were confluent (day 6 of the primary culture). The medium was replaced with 2% FCS/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) to which was added either IL-1β alone (Immugenex Corp., Los Angeles) or combined with Rtz at concentrations ranging between 0.1 and 10 μm. Cells were incubated for 18 h and analyzed as below. Immunological Studies—Chondrocytes were cultured in 4-chamber labtek slides (Merck) and incubated for 18 h in 2% FCS/DMEM with or without 1 μm Rtz. After being washed in PBS, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate and washed in blocking buffer (PBS with 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Tween 20). Fixed cells were then exposed to polyclonal PPAR-γ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted at 1:100 in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature (20 °C) in a humid chamber. After a quick rinse in 0.1% PBS/Tween, cells were exposed to the rabbit anti-goat Alexa 546-coupled secondary antibody (Molecular Probes and Invitrogen) diluted at 1:800 for 2 h. Cells were rinsed in PBS/Tween and mounted with Vectashield. The slides were observed with a Nikon Labophot 2 and photographed with a Spot camera driven by the Spot Jr software (Diagnostic Instrument). Controls were made by omission of primary antibody. Nuclear Extract and Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear proteins were extracted as described by Riquet et al. (22Riquet F.B. Tan L. Choy B.K. Osaki M. Karsenty G. Osborne T.F.

Briefly, cells were treated with various effectors for 60 min and then scraped on ice and washed twice in a PBS solution. After a centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the pellet was dissolved in an RSB 1× buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.002% NaN3) plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with a protease mixture inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). This step was repeated once. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 5100 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 420 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.01% NaN3). After a 30-min incubation, nuclear proteins were centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of buffer D (20 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.01% NaN3), collected, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Double-stranded oligonucleotide was labeled by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Samples of 6 μg of each nuclear extract were incubated with 50 fmol of double-stranded radiolabeled oligonucleotides in 6 μl of EMSA mix (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, and 300 mm KCl) plus 1 μg of poly[d(I-C)], 600 ng of bovine serum albumin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 ng of salmon sperm DNA in a final volume of 15 μl. Incubation was performed for 20 min at room temperature. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 6 or 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing, respectively, 1 or 0.25× TBE for 180 min at 130 V, transferred to 3MM paper (Whatman), dried under vacuum at 80 °C, and exposed to biotech x-ray film (Amersham Biosciences). To determine the specificity of the DNA protein complex, competition assay was performed using a 50- or 100-fold molar excess of the corresponding unlabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide. PPAR-γ (sc-1984X), PPAR-β (sc-1983X), and PPAR-α (sc-1985X) goat polyclonal antibodies, p50 goat polyclonal antibody (sc-1190X), p65 mouse monoclonal antibody (sc-8008X), Fos (253X), Fra-1 (sc-183X), Fra-2 (sc-171X), c-Fos (sc-52X), and c-Jun (sc-45X) rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Tebu, France). For supershift analysis, antibodies were added (2 μg) to the incubation for 15 min at 4 °C before the binding reaction. Three doublestranded oligonucleotides were constructed, containing either the canonical PPRE site from the acyl-CoA oxidase gene, 5′-AGCTGGACCAGGACAAAGGTCACGTT-3′, the composite PPRE/AP-1 element 5′-GGATCCTATAAAGCATGAGTCACACAGCCCTCAGCT-3′ at -83 to -71 in the rabbit MMP1 gene, or the NF-κB site at -3029 to -2994 5′-GGGAATTGAATATGGAAAAACACCAACATAGTTGAG-3′ (23Vincenti M.P. Coon C.I. Brinckerhoff C.E. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1987-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Rabbit chondrocytes were cultured in Ham's F-12 containing 10% FCS as described above, trypsinized, and plated in 6-well plates. Cells were then transfected at 70% confluence via a calcium phosphate precipitation method. Briefly, cells were incubated for 4 h with the precipitate obtained with 0.02 m CaCl2 in a Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, and 1.5 μg of DNA/well, i.e. either by adding 1 μg of the 3xPPRE-TK-Luc construct (a gift from Dr. P. Grimaldi, Nice, France) or the chimeric MMP1 promoter-luciferase construct with 500 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector. Each point was made in triplicate. Cells were then lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (Promega, France). Luciferase assay was performed using 20 μl of cell lysis on a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold, France). Efficiency of the transfection was shown to be 50–70% of total cells, as determined by β-galactosidase assay (Promega, France). Measurement of [35S]Sulfate Incorporation into Proteoglycans (PG)—The incorporation of [35S]sulfate into PG by articular chondrocytes was assessed as described previously (24Corvol M.T. Carrascosa A. Tsagris L. Blanchard O. Rappaport R. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 1422-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). At confluency, chondrocytes were incubated in 2% FCS/sulfate-free DMEM plus 1.5 μCi/ml Na2[35SO4] (75 MBq/ml, Amersham Biosciences) for 18 h in the presence or absence of effectors. Controls were prepared without any additive compound. Each point was prepared in triplicate. Proteoglycans were extracted from culture media and cell layer at 4 °C by incubation with 3 m guanidinium chloride in 0.05 m Tris-HCl (Merck), pH 7.4, in the presence of protease inhibitors (10 mm Na2EDTA (Sigma), 5 mm benzamidine (Merck), and 0.1 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid (Prolabo, Fontenay, Bois, France). Aliquots of the guanidinium extract were then spotted on a set of Whatman 3MM paper and allowed to dry. The set was used to quantify total high molecular weight/highly charged sulfated PG subunits, which were precipitated with 5% cetylpyridinium chloride in 0.3 m NaCl (Sigma) according to Larsson and Kuettner (25Larsson S.E. Kuettner K.E. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1974; 14: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Scintillation liquid was added to each strip, and the strips were counted in a Packard tricarb β-spectrometer. Each measurement was made in triplicate. For each experiment, the amount of DNA was measured in sister flasks by the fluorometric method described by Kapuscinski and Skoczylas (26Kapuscinski J. Skoczylas B. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 252-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Results were calculated as mean ± S.D. cellular or medium dpm/10 μg of DNA of four similarly treated wells. Results are presented as total radiolabeled PG expressed in percent of controls performed with cells from three different animals. Zymography—Zymographic analysis of gelatinase activities was performed by using cell culture supernatants (10 μl). The chondrocyteconditioned medium, mixed with 4× sample buffer (250 mm Tris base, 2.5% SDS, 12.5% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), was subjected to electrophoresis at 4 °C on a 0.1% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mg/ml gelatin. After electrophoresis, the SDS was removed by washing the gel in a 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min with one change of the incubating buffer. The gel was then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in incubation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 1 μm ZnCl2, 0.0015% Brij-35, 2.5% Triton X-100). Gels were stained with 0.5% Coomassie Blue, 10% acetic acid, 30% methanol buffer and destained with sequential discoloration solutions until the digested bands were clearly separated. A molecular marker was electrophoresed. The levels of the 92-, 72-, and 53/58-kDa gelatinolytic activities were quantified by video densitometry. Western Blotting—Proteins were extracted from culture medium by addition of 5 volumes of cold acetone and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was collected in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing protease inhibitors. Proteins were size-separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gel. A Colored Rainbow mix, code RPN 756 (Amersham Biosciences), was used as the molecular weight marker. The gel was electroblotted to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3) in a Transblot Cell (Bio-Rad). Equal transfer of proteins was confirmed by staining the nitrocellulose with Ponceau Red (0.2% w/v H2O diluted 99:1 in 10% trifluoroacetic acid). The MMP1 antibody (polyclonal goat anti-human MMP1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Tebu, France)) was diluted at 1:200 and used as primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. A peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Dako P0160) was used as secondary antibody at 1:2000 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence as instructed by the manufacturer (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Semi-quantitative scanning densitometry was performed with the NIH image software (results were standardized using Ponceau Red staining for homogeneity). Production of Rabbit cDNA Probes by RT-PCR—MMP probes were generated by RT-PCR in accordance with the human sequences, selected in a domain conserved across species for MMP1, MMP3, and MMP13 (GenBank™ accession numbers M17821, M25664, and M002427, respectively). Total RNA was prepared from control or IL-1β (10 ng/ml)-treated rabbit chondrocytes and synthesized into cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega). Briefly 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed at 42 °C for 1 h in a 25-μl reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNA was amplified for PCR on a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the following program: 96 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 55–60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. A 15-min 72 °C extension step completed the reaction. PCR products were subcloned in pGEM vector. Rabbit MMP1 Promoter Cloning—Genomic DNA from rabbit chondrocytes was extracted by Trizol (Invitrogen), according to the supplier's instructions. MMP1 promoter primers were chosen in the GenBank™ accession number M17820: 5′-CGGGGTACCGACCAAGGACTCAAGA-3′ and 5′-ACTGAGAAGGAAGACACTCGAGCGG-3′. A proofreading Taq (Pfu Turbo, Stratagene, France) was used for PCR with the long range method (hot start: 96 °C, 5 min), 10 cycles ((98 °C, 30 s; 57 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 5 min)), 20 cycles ((98 °C, 30 s; 57 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 5 min with an incrementation of 20 s per cycle)), and terminal extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The 3.5-kb MMP1 promoter fragment was purified with Geneclean Sprint kit (Bio 101) and inserted in pGL3-basic vector (Promega, France) using KpnI and XhoI restriction sites. Mutagenesis—All mutants were generated with the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (France). The dominant negative PPAR-γ was constructed following the procedure (27Hess J. Porte D. Munz C. Angel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20029-20038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) described by Gurnell et al. (28Gurnell M. Wentworth J.M.

A double point mutation (AAAGCA to AGTAGT) was introduced into the proximal PPRE-like site -83 to -78 to generate the pGL-MMP1-ΔPPRE, by using the forward sequence primer 5′-TCAAGAGGATGTTATAGTAGTTGAGTCACACAGC-3′, corresponding to region -99 to -65 of the rabbit MMP1 promoter. DNA Sequencing—Automated sequencing was performed by Genome Express to confirm the identity of all DNA probes and constructs used in the study. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot—Total RNA was extracted from cells by a single-step method using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Samples of 10 μg of total RNA were used for Northern blot analysis. The rabbit MMP1, -3, and -13 cDNA probes were synthesized by RT-PCR. All probes were labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) to a specific activity of 108 to 109 cpm/μg. Results were normalized by using a human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe and quantified using Studio Scan II (Agfa, Paris, France) with the NIH software. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistics were performed by analysis of variance. Multiple comparisons were performed with the Tukey test. Differences between groups were considered significant for p ≤ 0.05. Presence of Functional PPAR-γ in Cultured Articular Chondrocytes—PPAR-γ displayed nuclear localization in our in vitro model of cultured rabbit chondrocytes, independently of Rtz treatment (Fig. 1A). EMSA was carried out with nuclear extracts from 1 μm Rtz-treated chondrocytes and an oligonucleotide containing the canonical PPRE sequence described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1B showed the involvement of the PPRE-containing oligonucleotide in a robust protein-DNA complex. Binding specificity was confirmed by using an 80-fold molar excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide. This complex was supershifted in the presence of anti-PPAR-γ antibody. Finally, Rtz increased luciferase activity in chondrocytes transiently transfected with a PPRE-luciferase gene reporter, in a dose-dependent manner from 0.1 to 1 μm. Maximum activity (4-fold induction) was observed at 1 μm and stayed in plateau up to 10 μm (Fig. 1C). Low Concentrations of Rtz (≤1 μm) Selectively Inhibit IL-1β-induced Proteoglycan Degradation, Gelatinolytic Activities, and MMP1 Production—Chondrocytes were incubated for 18 h in sulfate-free medium in the presence of 35S-radiolabeled sulfate with or without effectors. 35S-Sulfate incorporation into cetylpyridinium chloride-precipitable PG was measured in the culture medium. Fig. 2A shows that in the presence of IL-1β alone total 35S-sulfated PG were decreased by 35 ± 10%, from 6.35 ± 0.56 104 dpm/10 μg DNA in control conditions to 4.12 ± 0.39 104 dpm/10 μg DNA (p < 0.01). Addition of Rtz reproducibly induced a dose-dependent stimulation of 35S-sulfated PG and fully restored control values at doses as low as 1 μm, being stable at 10 μm. These results show that low concentrations (≤1 μm) of Rtz counteract the detrimental effect of IL-1β on proteoglycans production. We then asked whether this inhibitory effect involved the inhibition of the documented induction of matrix metalloproteinases production induced by IL-1β in chondrocytes. Among them MMP1 can be studied by gelatinolytic activity at an apparent molecular mass of 53/58 kDa. In our control conditions, chondrocytes secreted two main gelatinolytic activities at apparent molecular masses of 92 and 72 kDa, presumably corresponding to MMP9 and MMP2, respectively. Fig. 2B is representative of three separate experiments. Treatment with IL-1β alone caused an augmentation of the 92-kDa band and induced a new gelatinolytic activity at an apparent mass of 53–58 kDa, whereas no modification of the 72-kDa band was observed. Quantification analysis of the 92- and 53–58-kDa bands was done as relating to the 72-kDa band. The 92-kDa gelatinolytic activity was decreased by 40 ± 3% and by 50 ± 5% (p < 0.01) with 1 and 10 μm Rtz, respectively. The IL-1β-induced 53/58-kDa gelatinolytic activity was decreased by 35 ± 5% and by 55 ± 7% (p < 0.01) with 0.5 and 1 or 10 μm Rtz, respectively. Similar results were observed at the protein level as shown by Western blot analysis. Fig. 2C is representative of three separate experiments. Scanning densitometry of the bands showed that the mean ± S.D. of IL-1β overexpression of the MMP1 signal (apparent molecular mass, 52 kDa) was significantly decreased by Rtz in a dose-dependent manner, i.e. by 41 ± 3.8% (p < 0.01), 70 ± 11% (p < 0.001), and 81 ± 6% (p < 0.001), with 0.1, 0.5, or 1 μm Rtz, respectively. These concurring data strongly suggest that the gelatinolytic activity observed at 53/58 kDa corresponds to the MMP1 protein. The Inhibitory Effect of Rtz on IL-1β-induced MMP1 mRNA Expression Is a Direct Mechanism—Steady state levels of MMP1 mRNA were analyzed by Northern blotting, as compared with MMP3 and MMP13 mRNAs. As shown in Fig. 3A, MMP1, -3, and -13 mRNA levels were close to detection limits in control conditions, but were strongly expressed in the presence of IL-1β. Co-treatment of Rtz and IL-1β decreased mRNA levels of MMP1, -3, and -13 by 25, 10, and 15%, respectively (0.5 μm Rtz), and by 70, 40, and 55% (1 μm Rtz) (Fig. 3B). This effect did not appear mediated by protein synthesis, as cycloheximide did not modify the inhibitory effect of Rtz on MMP1, -3, or -13 mRNA levels (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that down-regulation of IL-1β-induced proteoglycan degradation by Rtz may be mediated by inhibition of MMP production by chondrocytes. We then focused on the Rtz effect on MMP1 gene transcription. The Inhibitory Effect of Rtz on IL-1β-induced MMP1 Gene Is Transcriptional and Requires PPAR-γ—Chondrocytes were transiently transfected with a pMMP1-luciferase construct containing 3448 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the rabbit MMP1 gene linked to the luciferase gene and supplemented with IL-1β and/or Rtz as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each point was done in triplicate, and this experiment was performed three times with different animals for the dose-response curve and twice for the dominant negative experiments. Fig. 4 showed that luciferase activity was not modified by addition of 1 μm Rtz alone, whereas it was increased 4-fold by IL-1β. Co-treatment of chondrocytes with IL-1β and increasing concentrations of Rtz led to a dose-dependent reduction of MMP1 promoter activity corresponding to 23 ± 3% and 42 ± 3% (n-1 = 17, p < 0.001) inhibition with 0.5 and 1 μm Rtz, respectively, as compared with IL-1β-treated cells. In addition, a more pronounced inhibitory effec"

We investigated the role of polycystin-1 in Wnt signaling and activator protein-1 (AP-1) activation. To this aim, a membrane-targeted construct encoding the conserved C-terminal region of mouse polycystin-1 reported to mediate signal transduction activity was expressed in human embryonic and renal epithelial cells. To ensure specificity and minimal cotransfection effects, we focused our study on the endogenous proteins that actually transduce the signals, β-catenin and T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor for Wnt signaling and (phosphorylated) c-Jun, ATF2, and c-Fos for AP-1. Our data indicate that the C-terminal region of polycystin-1 activates AP-1 by inducing phosphorylation and expression of at least c-Jun and ATF2, whereas c-Fos was not affected. Under our experimental conditions, polycystin-1 did not modulate Wnt signaling. AP-1 activity was aberrant in human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) renal cystic epithelial cells and in renal epithelial cells expressing transgenic full-length polycystin-1, resulting in decreased Jun-ATF and increased Jun-Fos activity, whereas Wnt signaling remained unaffected. Since our data indicate that aberrant polycystin-1 expression results in altered AP-1 activity, polycystin-1 may be required for adequate AP-1 activity.

In the majority of patients, the disease can be accounted for by a mutation in the PKD1 gene (1The European Polycystic Kidney Disease ConsortiumCell. 1994; 77: 881-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 2The International Polycystic Kidney Disease ConsortiumCell. 1995; 81: 289-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), whereas a minority suffers from a mutation in the PKD2 gene (3Kimberling W.J.

The precise function of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, the proteins encoded by the PKD1 and PKD2 gene, respectively, remains to be elucidated. Polycystin-1 is predicted to be a transmembrane protein of ∼460 kDa. The large extracellular N terminus contains multiple domains thought to be involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The intracellular C terminus of polycystin-1 contains putative phosphorylation sites and a coiled-coil domain that can mediate protein-protein interactions. Several studies have implicated a role for polycystin-1 in signal transduction. Overexpression of the C-terminal region of polycystin-1 in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells has been shown to activate the Wnt signaling pathway (5Kim E. Arnould T. Sellin L.K. Benzing T.

Furthermore, overexpression of a full-length polycystin-1 construct has been reported to activate the Janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway (8Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Boletta A. Liu L. Qian F. Xu P.N. Germino F.J. Germino G.G. Cell. 2002; 109: 157-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). These signaling pathways are all involved in key cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation, cell cycle regulation, and cell survival. Since these cellular processes are essential for normal function, the signaling pathways governing them are tightly regulated. We set out to investigate the activation of signaling pathways by polycystin-1. To identify relevant signaling events, a membrane-targeted construct containing the C-terminal domain of polycystin-1, the highly conserved region that has been proven previously to successfully activate luciferase reporters for AP-1 and Wnt signaling (5Kim E.

To determine the physiological relevance of this approach, renal epithelial cells expressing transgenic full-length polycystin-1 and ADPKD renal cystic epithelial cells were subsequently analyzed. Our study focuses on the Wnt signaling pathway and the AP-1 transcription factor complex. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, polarity, migration, and survival (reviewed in Ref. 9Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by Wnt, cytoplasmic free β-catenin is stabilized and subsequently translocated to the nucleus. Binding of β-catenin to T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors then results in transactivation. Thus, β-catenin plays a dual role in the cell, as a transducer of canonical Wnt signaling and as a key component of cell adhesion, since β-catenin is also an integral part of adhesion junctions. Cellular adhesion and signaling are therefore coupled via β-catenin. The AP-1 transcription factor complex regulates key cellular responses such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival and can be activated by a variety of stimuli such as growth factors and stresses (reviewed in Refs. 10van Dam H. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2453-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar and 11Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). The AP-1 complex can be composed of homo- or heterodimers of a variety of transcription factors including Jun, ATF, and Fos family members. The heterogeneity of the AP-1 complex is thought to provide a mechanism to regulate the cellular response. In most cell types, growth factors, serum, and phorbol esters predominantly induce Jun-Fos transcriptional activity, whereas stress-inducing stimuli such as UV-C irradiation and alkylating agents predominantly result in activation of Jun-ATF. Heterogeneity is further illustrated by the fact that Jun-Fos heterodimers bind to the 7-bp consensus sequence TGAGTCA, whereas Jun-ATF heterodimers recognize the 8-bp consensus sequence TGACNTCA. To ensure specificity, we focused our study on the proteins that actually transduce the signal, β-catenin and TCF/LEF for Wnt signaling and c-Jun, ATF2, and c-Fos for AP-1. We report here the activation of Jun-ATF heterodimers by the membrane-targeted mouse C-terminal polycystin-1 fusion protein construct. Moreover, AP-1 activity was aberrant in human ADPKD renal cystic epithelial cells and in renal epithelial cells expressing transgenic human full-length polycystin-1, resulting in impaired Jun-ATF and increased Jun-Fos activity, whereas Wnt signaling was not affected.

Briefly, cells were fixed with methanol/acetone (1:2) or 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk/phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies.

Coverslips were embedded in gelvatol (5 g of polyvinylalcohol in 30% glycerol and 100 mg/ml DABCO) with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole·2HCl as a nuclear marker. Fluorescence was obtained using a Leica DMRBE microscope type 301–371.011 (Leica, Rijswijk, The Netherlands). Images were digitally stored using IP Lab Spectrum version 3.1 software. Immunohistochemistry—Human renal tissue sections from healthy individuals and from patients diagnosed with ADPKD were immunostained for β-catenin as described (24van de Wetering M. Sancho E.

Staining was developed using DAB (brown precipitate). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Membrane-targeted Mouse C-terminal Polycystin-1 Does Not Activate Wnt Signaling in HEK293 and MDCK Cells—Wnt activation is reflected by transactivation of luciferase in the TOP versus the control FOP reporter construct (Fig. 1A). Since the luciferase reporter construct contains three binding sites for Wnt-specific TCF/LEF transcription factors only, activation requires intact components of the signaling cascade in the cells tested. HEK293 and canine renal tubular epithelial (MDCK) cells transfected with the constitutive active β-catenin Ser33 mutant, β-cat S33, showed significant Wnt activation, as reflected by the markedly increased TOP/FOP ratio compared with unstimulated and empty vector control (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the cells tested were indeed capable of generating an adequate cellular response upon induction of Wnt signaling. However, no significant Wnt activation was detected after transfection with the membrane-targeted mouse C-terminal polycystin-1 construct, mPKD1HT, in both HEK293 (Fig. 1A) and MDCK cells (Fig. 1B). To exclude the possibility that induction of Wnt signaling by mPKD1HT was below the measuring threshold of the luciferase reporter assay, we tested for the hallmarks of Wnt activation, cytoplasmic accumulation, and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, using Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining for β-catenin (Fig. 1, C and D). Significant accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin were detected only in cells transfected with the β-catenin Ser33 mutant construct. The mPKD1HT construct was correctly expressed in transfected cells (Fig. 1C, middle panel) and was correctly targeted to the plasma membrane, although a significant amount was also present in the cytoplasm as detected using immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown). We and other groups have previously reported the expression of endogenous polycystin-1 in the plasma membrane (23Scheffers M.S. Le H. van der Bent P. Leonhard W. Prins F. Spruit L. Breuning M.H. de Heer E. Peters D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Huan Y. van Adelsberg J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 26van Adelsberg J. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2000; 15: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The housekeeping protein MSH2 was incorporated as a loading control (Fig. 1C, lower panel). In mPKD1HT-transfected cells, β-catenin was exclusively detected associated to the plasma membrane as a component of adherens junctions (Fig. 1D, right panel). Cells expressing β-cat S33 exhibited both the plasma membrane-associated and nuclear localization (Fig. 1D, left panel). We conclude that under the defined experimental conditions, the membrane-targeted mouse C-terminal polycystin-1 construct does not induce Wnt signaling in HEK293 and MDCK cells. Furthermore, in M7 cells, mouse SV40 large T-immortalized renal tubular epithelial cells expressing transgenic human full-length polycystin-1, Wnt activation was detected but did not differ from M8 control cells (Fig. 1E). Both cell lines were capable of responding adequately to Wnt induction by β-cat S33. Thus, expression of polycystin-1 did not directly activate Wnt signaling. Membrane-targeted Mouse C-terminal Polycystin-1 Does Not Augment β-Catenin Ser33-induced Wnt Activation—HEK293 and MDCK cells co-transfected with mPKD1HT and β-cat S33 did not show a significant difference in Wnt activation as compared with co-transfection of β-cat S33 with pDNA1.1, the vector backbone of mPKD1HT (Fig. 2A). Moreover, in the colon epithelial carcinoma cell lines, HCT116 (Fig. 2B) and SW480 (data not shown), which exhibit constitutively active Wnt signaling due to mutations in the β-catenin and APC gene, respectively, mPKD1HT did not have an effect on canonical Wnt signaling as detected using the TOP/FOP assay. Transfection of β-catenin Ser33 in HCT116 and SW480 did induce Wnt signaling above the activation level in the unstimulated status. In conclusion, the membrane-targeted mouse C-terminal polycystin-1 construct did not augment β-catenin Ser33-induced Wnt activation. Wnt Signaling Is Not Affected in ADPKD Renal Cystic Epithelium—Since overexpression of polycystin-1 did not result in activation or augmentation of Wnt signaling, we investigated Wnt signaling in the human renal ADPKD cystic epithelial cell lines, PKD9–7WT and PKD10–7WT. PKD9–7WT and PKD10–7WT as well as the control cell line, RCTEC, did not differ in Wnt activation in the unstimulated state as detected by the TOP/FOP reporter assay, whereas cells did exhibit an adequate cellular response upon activation of Wnt signaling by β-cat S33 (Fig. 3A, 2-fold induction by β-cat S33 compared with the empty vector in all cells). Immunofluorescent staining for β-catenin revealed only the expected plasma membrane-associated localization of β-catenin (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of renal cystic tissues of four ADPKD patients with mutations in PKD1 did not show distinct cytoplasmic accumulation or nuclear translocation of β-catenin (Fig. 3C, ADPKD patient H84–3821 shown in the right panel). Thus, in established ADPKD cystic epithelium, Wnt signaling was not significantly affected. Membrane-targeted Mouse C-terminal Polycystin-1 Activates AP-1 via Jun-ATF2 in HEK293 and NRK-52E Cells—The AP-1 transcription factor complex can be activated by a variety of stimuli such as growth factors and stresses that can induce both Jun-Fos and Jun-ATF activity. We tested activation of AP-1 using distinct luciferase reporter constructs (Fig. 4A, upper panel). The 5×coll and 7×AP-1 reporters are activated by Jun-Fos heterodimers and can be strongly induced by TPA (19Ouwens D.M. de Ruiter N.D. van der Zon G.C. Carter A.P. Schouten J. van der Burgt C.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The 5×jun reporter construct mainly monitors Jun-ATF activity and is hardly enhanced by TPA. In HEK293 cells, TPA specifically activated the 5×coll and 7×AP-1 luciferase reporters but not the 5×jun reporter in cells cultured under serum-free conditions (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the constitutively active Rho GTPase, cdc42 V12, strongly induced the 5×jun reporter. Therefore, activation of Jun-ATF and Jun-Fos heterodimers can indeed be distinguished in this cell type using these reporters. The membrane-targeted mouse C-terminal polycystin-1 construct specifically induced the 5×jun reporter, whereas activation of the 5×coll and 7×AP-1 reporters was not detectable. Similar results were obtained in HEK293 (Fig. 4A), HEK293T cells (data not shown), and the renal epithelial cell line, NRK-52E (Fig. 4B). The effect of the mPKD1HT construct on activation of the 5×jun reporter in NRK-52E cells was similar to the activation observed with the known inducers of Jun-ATF2 activity, cdc42 V12 and UV-C. Moreover, the effect of the mPKD1HT construct on the 5×jun reporter was dosage-dependent (Fig. 4C). Thus, under the defined experimental conditions membrane-targeted mouse C-terminal polycystin-1 enhanced Jun-ATF rather than Jun-Fos activity. Membrane-targeted Mouse C-terminal Polycystin-1 Induces Phosphorylation and Expression of c-Jun and Increases Phosphorylation of ATF2—In conjunction with the activation of the Jun-ATF dependent 5×jun luciferase reporter, expression of mPKD1HT increased both total and Ser73 phosphorylation of endogenous c-Jun in HEK293 (Fig. 5A, left panel) and HEK293T cells (data not shown). Densitometry analysis of Western blots indicated that the effect of the mPKD1HT construct occurred pr"

Self-resistance to these antibiotics in <i>S. peucetius</i> is conferred by the <i>drrA</i>B locus that codes for two proteins, DrrA and DrrB. DrrA is an ATP-binding protein. It belongs to the ABC family of transporters and shares sequence and functional similarities with P-glycoprotein of cancer cells. DrrB is an integral membrane protein that might function as a transporter for the efflux of daunorubicin and doxorubicin. Together, DrrA and DrrB are believed to form an ATP-driven pump for the efflux of these drugs. The <i>drrAB</i> locus has been cloned, and the two proteins have been expressed in a functional form in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. A topological analysis of the DrrB protein was performed using gene fusion methodology. Random and site-directed fusions of the <i>drrB</i> gene to <i>lacZ, phoA</i>, or <i>gfp</i> reporter genes were created.

In this study we show that the –100 to –20 region of the CD11d promoter confers myeloid-specific activation of the CD11d promoter. Transforming growth factor β-inducible early gene-1 (TIEG1) was isolated in a yeast one-hybrid screen using the –100 to –20 region of the CD11d promoter as bait. Purified GST·TIEG1 protein was able to bind within the –61 to –45 region that overlaps a shorter binding site for Sp1. Transient overexpression of TIEG1 activated the CD11d promoter specifically in myeloid cells, whereas, down-regulation of TIEG1 with small interfering TIEG1 RNA also down-regulated expression of CD11d. In vivo, TIEG1 does not physically interact with Sp1. Cotransfection and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses of TIEG1, Sp1, and Sp3 revealed that TIEG1 competes with these Sp proteins for binding to overlapping sites in the CD11d promoter. Although TIEG1 and Sp1 are ubiquitously expressed in myeloid and non-myeloid cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed differential occupancy of the CD11d promoter by these factors. In undifferentiated myeloid and non-myeloid cells, occupancy of the CD11d promoter by TIEG1 is similar. Upon differentiation of myeloid cells and subsequent up-regulation of CD11d expression, TIEG1 occupancy increases. In contrast, occupancy by TIEG1 remains low in non-myeloid cells exposed to phorbol ester. We propose that up-regulation of CD11d expression following differentiation of myeloid cells is mediated through increased binding of TIEG1 binding to the CD11d promoter.

The latest leukocyte integrin gene to be identified is CD11d, and as such, it is also the least understood with regards to its function and mode of regulation. CD11d is prominently expressed on macrophage foam cells and splenic red pulp macrophages, which suggests a role in the atherosclerotic process such as lipid scavenging and phagocytosis of pathogens and senescent erythrocytes (11Van der Vieren M. Le Trong H. Wood C.L. Moore P.F. St John T. Staunton D.E. Gallatin W.M. Immunity. 1995; 3: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Synovial macrophages and lung alveolar macrophages also highly express CD11d suggesting that this molecule might perpetuate the inflammatory reactions associated with rheumatoid arthritis and lung injury (13el-Gabalawy H.

To understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for expression of CD11d, we previously isolated a genomic clone containing the 5′-untranslated portion of CD11d and showed that cell-specific expression of this gene is mediated through both Sp1 and Sp3 (15Noti J.D. Johnson A.K. Dillon J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8959-8969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Regulation by members of the Sp transcription factor family appears to be a common theme for expression of the leukocyte integrin genes as functional Sp1 sites are also found in the CD11a-c (16Lopez-Rodriguez C.

Because a number of transcription factors, including PU.1, GABPα, GABPβ, c-Jun, c-Fos, Ets, and c/EBP, were shown to functionally interact at sites adjacent to the Sp1 binding sites on the CD11a –c and CD18 genes (7Noti J.D. Current Genomics. 2003; 4: 527-542Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the CD11d promoter may also be regulated by transcription factors binding near the Sp1/Sp3 site. In this study we show that transforming growth factor-β-inducible early gene-1 (TIEG1), 1The abbreviations used are: TIEG1, transforming growth factor-β-inducible early gene-1; AD, activation domain; BD, binding domain; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis; RT, reverse transcriptase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; Rb, human retinoblastoma protein; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase; HA, hemagglutinin; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; CMV, cytomegalovirus; siRNA, small interference RNA; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase; TGF, transforming growth factor. a member of the Kruppel-like factor family (20Subramaniam M.

Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1610-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), binds to a site overlapping the Sp1 site and activates the CD11d gene specifically in myeloid cells. In contrast, TIEG1 down-regulates CD11d expression in non-myeloid cells. We also provide evidence that up-regulation of CD11d by prolonged exposure to a high concentration of phorbol ester specifically in myeloid cells is accompanied by increased binding of TIEG1 to the CD11d promoter in vivo. Cell Culture—THP1 (acute monocytic leukemia, ATCC TIB-202), HL60 (promyelocytic leukemia, ATCC CCL-240), IM9 (B-cell multiple myeloma, ATCC CCL-159), Jurkat (T-cell acute leukemia, ATCC TIB-152), and K562 (highly undifferentiated progenitors of erythrocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes, ATT CCL-243) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (IM9 cells were grown in 20% fetal calf serum). Schneider's Drosophila 2 cells (Drosophila melanogaster embryo, ATCC CRL-1963) were grown in Schneider's medium containing 10% insect-tested fetal calf serum (Sigma). All medium contained 100 units/ml each of streptomycin and penicillin. For certain experimental procedures, cells were stimulated with 10 mm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 24 h, or 100 nm PMA for 48 h. Yeast One-hybrid Analysis—Following the protocol outlined in the MATCHMAKER One-Hybrid System (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), four copies of the –100 to –20 region of the CD11d promoter were ligated into the SmaI site of yeast reporter pHisi-1 and into the XhoI site of yeast reporter pLacZi to create reporters pHisi-1-CD11d(–100/–20) and pLacZi-CD11d(–100/–20). A yeast dual reporter strain was prepared by first integrating pHis-1-CD11d(–100/–20) followed by pLacZi-CD11d(–100/–20) into the genome of yeast strain YM4271. The dual reporter strain was selected and maintained on SD minimal medium lacking histidine and uracil. A human spleen cDNA library (Clontech, cat. #HL4054AH), prepared in the plasmid pACT2 to generate fusions of spleen cDNA with the GAL4 Activation Domain (AD), was transformed into the yeast dual reporter strain. Yeast transformants were selected on SD/–Leu/–His/–Ura medium containing 30 or 45 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). The spleen cDNA/Gal4 fusion plasmids were recovered from the transformants and re-transformed into the dual reporter strain and plated onto SD/–Leu/–His/–Ura/45 mm 3-AT medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). All cDNA/Gal4AD fusion plasmids that retested positive also expressed robust β-galactosidase activity from the integrated LacZ reporter. The recovered plasmids were sequenced and analyzed by a BLAST search of GenBank™. Full-length TIEG1 cDNA corresponding to the partial cDNAs in the recovered plasmids were obtained as detailed below. Plasmids—Four copies of the –100 to –20 region of the CD11d promoter were placed upstream of the minimal SV40 promoter in pGL3-Promoter (Promega, Madison, WI). The –173 to +74 region of the CD11d promoter was fused to the luciferase gene in pGL3-Basic (Promega) to create reporter plasmid CD11d(–173/+74)-luc (15Noti J.D. Johnson A.K. Dillon J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8959-8969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Noti J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24038-24045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 5-bp mutations (changing Gs to As and Cs to Ts) were introduced into CD11d(–173/+74)-luc using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Expression plasmids pPacSp1 and pPacSp3, which express Sp1 and Sp3 from the Drosophila actin promoter, and the empty cassette plasmid pPacO, were generously provided by Dr. R. Tjian. Expression plasmids pCMV4-Sp1/flu and pCMV4-Sp3/flu, which express HA-tagged Sp1 and Sp3 from the cytomegalovirus early promoter, were generously provided by Dr. J. M. Horowitz (23Udvadia A.J.

Full-length TIEG1 cDNA (accession number NM005655) was amplified from human spleen Quick-Clone cDNA (Clontech) by PCR. XhoI sites were incorporated at the 5′-ends of the amplification primers to facilitate cloning of full-length TIEG1 into the mammalian expression plasmid pCMV-HA (Clontech) and the GST fusion plasmid pET42a (Novagen, Madison, WI). Transfection and Reporter Assays—Human cells were transfected by electroporation as previously described (15Noti J.D. Johnson A.K. Dillon J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8959-8969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and analyzed by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Approximately 1 × 107 cells were cotransfected with 10 μg of each firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, 5 μg of each expression plasmid when used (see figure legends for specific details), and 2 μg of Renilla luciferase plasmid pRL-SV40 (Promega). The total concentration of transfected DNA was adjusted to 20 μg with pCMV-HA. Luciferase activity in cells 24 h post-transfection was measured in a LB96V-2 Wallac Berthold plate luminometer and normalized against Renilla luciferase activity or against the total protein concentration in the cellular extract. The assays were performed in triplicate and repeated three to four times to ensure reproducibility. Statistical analysis was performed by using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Roselle, IL), and pooled data from individual experiments were expressed as means ± S.D. GST·TIEG1 Preparation—Full-length cDNA for TIEG1 was cloned in-frame with the GST portion of the bacterial expression plasmid pET42a. The pET42a-GST·TIEG1 plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), and a single isolated colony was grown in a 500-ml culture and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h as per the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). The induced cells were harvested, resuspended in a wash/bind buffer containing Triton X-100 and lysozyme, and lysed by sonication following the protocol outlined in the Bugbuster GST-Bind purification kit (Novagen). The lysate was poured through a column loaded with GST-Bind resin, and bound GST·TIEG1 protein was subsequently eluted off the resin with reduced glutathione. Western blot analyses of the GST·TIEG1 protein with anti-GST monoclonal antibodies (Novagen) and anti-TIEG1 antibodies generously supplied by Dr. T. C. Spelsberg (20Subramaniam M. Harris S.A.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5783-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were performed as previously described (22Noti J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24038-24045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). GST Pull-Down Assays—Varying amounts (50 ng to 2 μg) of purified GST·TIEG1 or unfused GST protein were mixed with 200 μl of GST-Bind resin (Novagen) and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. The resin was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and mixed with 50 ng of purified recombinant Sp1 protein (Promega) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ZnCl2, 0.1% dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A and incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. The resin was collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blot (22Noti J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24038-24045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with anti-Sp1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in the primary reaction and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-goat immunoglobulins (Amersham Biosciences) in the secondary incubation reaction. In Vivo Coimmunoprecipitation—Approximately 1 × 107 THP1 or HL60 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pCMV4-Sp1/flu, pCMV-HA-TIEG1, or CMV-Rb (human retinoblastoma protein) (24Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Higgins P.D. Murata Y. Martin K.H. Humphrey P.A. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) or combinations of each (see figure legend for details). The transfected cells were harvested 24 h later, washed in cold PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The cell lysate was incubated on ice for 20 min and clarified by centrifugation, anti-Sp1 antibodies were added to achieve a 5 μg/ml final concentration, and incubation was continued for 1 h at 4 °C. To precipitate the immune complexes, 50 μl of Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the lysate with incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation, washed extensively with lysis buffer and a final wash with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer for analysis by Western blot. To detect proteins in the immune complexes, rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibodies (to detect HA-TIEG1 and HA-Sp1) and rabbit anti-Rb (to detect CMV-Rb) were added in the primary reaction followed by the addition of goat anti-rabbit HRP in the secondary reaction. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis—EMSA was performed as previously described (26Noti J.D. Reinemann C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using nuclear extracts that were either purchased (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) or prepared as previously described (26Noti J.D. Reinemann C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To initially localize the binding site of TIEG1, the following double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were used: 5′-TGTTCCATAATTAACCACGCCCCTCCTACCCACTGTGCCCCTCTTCCTGC-3′, which corresponds to the –80 to –31 region of the CD11d promoter; 5′-TTCCATAATTAACCAATAAACTCCTACCCACTGTG-3′, which corresponds to the –78 to –44 region of the CD11d promoter (this probe contains the 5-bp mutation at the –61 site shown in boldface); 5′-AACCACGCCCCTCCTCAAACCTGTGCCCCTCTTCC-3′, which corresponds to the –68 to –34 region of the CD11d promoter (this probe contains the 5-bp mutation at the –51 site shown in boldface). A more precise localization of TIEG1 binding was performed using a series of seven double-stranded oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the –66 to –40 region of the CD11d promoter. The seven probes contained a different 3-bp mutation (shown in boldface) and are as follows: WT, 5′-CCACGCCCCTCCTACCCACTGTGCCC-3′, which corresponds to the wild-type –66 to –40 region (the –61 and –51 sites that were mutated in the above probes are underlined for reference); mut1, 5′-AACCGCCCCTCCTACCCACTGTGCCC-3′; mut2, 5′-CCACGAAACTCCTACCCACTGTGCCCC-3′; mut3, 5′-CCACGCCCCTAAGACCCACTGTGCCCC-3′; mut4, 5′-CCACGCCCCTCCTAAAAACTGTGCCCC-3′; mut5, 5′-CCACGCCCCTCCTACCCACGTGGCCCC-3′; and mut6, 5′-CCACGCCCCTCCTACCCACTGTGAAAC-3′. The probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP to a specific activity of 2–4 × 108 cpm/μg. Each probe (1 × 104 cpm) was incubated for 30 min on ice with either 5 μg of nuclear extract, 100 ng of purified recombinant Sp1 protein, or 100–200 ng of purified GST·TIEG1 as previously described (18Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Antibodies to Sp1 or TIEG1 were included in some incubation mixes for supershift analysis, and all reaction products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (18Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit essentially as described by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Cells (1 × 108) were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. To quench the cross-linking reaction, glycine was added to 125 mm final concentration. The cells were washed with cold PBS, lysed with SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), and the lysate was sonicated to shear the genomic DNA to ∼500 bp in length. The lysate was then diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) containing the above protease inhibitor mix. An aliquot of the diluted lysate was incubated for 4 h at 65 °C to reverse the cross-links and used as input DNA. To reduce the nonspecific background, the remainder of the lysate was incubated with a salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by removal of the protein A-agarose by centrifugation. The supernatant fraction was incubated with anti-TIEG1 or anti-Sp1 antibodies, or no antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The anti-TIEG1·DNA·TIEG1 and anti-Sp1·DNA·Sp1 complexes were precipitated from the supernatant fractions following incubation with salmon sperm DNA·protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitated complexes were extensively washed with buffers from the manufacturer and resuspended in 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) for 15 min at room temperature to elute the DNA·TIEG1 and DNA·Sp1 complexes from the protein A-agarose. After removal of the protein A-agarose by centrifugation, 10 μl of 5 m NaCl was added to the supernatant, which was then heated for 4 h at 65 °C to reverse the cross-links. To purify the immunoprecipitated DNA, proteinase K was added (50 μg/ml final concentration) for 1 h at 45 °C, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation, and resuspension of the DNA in 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The immunoprecipitated DNA was then amplified by the PCR using primers corresponding to regions of the CD11d promoter. The primers used to amplify the –200 to –20 region were: 5′-GCTCCTGAGGCCTGGGGGAGGGTGG-3′ (forward primer,–200 to –176) and 5′-GCCTCCACACAGCAGGAAGAGGGGC-3′ (reverse primer,–20 to –44). The primers used to amplify the –712 to –520 region were as follows: 5′-AACCACTCTTCTGATTTCTATCTTCG-3′ (forward primer,–712 to –688) and 5′-AGGCAACATAGCCAGACCCTGTC-3′ (–520 to –542). The PCR cycling parameters were as follows: 1 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, for 30 cycles. An aliquot of input genomic DNA from each cell line was amplified by the PCR along with aliquots of immunoprecipitated DNAs to assess the relative binding of each transcription factor. The PCR products were subjected to gel electrophoresis, stained with Vistra Green, and analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). For analysis, the level of each immunoprecipitated DNA was compared with the level of the appropriate input DNA (detailed in the figure legends). To ensure that the PCRs were performed within the linear range of amplification, samples were analyzed at 21, 24, 27, 30, 36, and 39 cycles. Small Interfering RNA Silencing of TIEG1 Expression—TIEG1 siRNA was prepared using the Silencer siRNA mixture kit (RNaseIII) essentially as described by the manufacturer (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). TIEG1 cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 151–514 of the TIEG1 sequence (accession number NM005655) was prepared by PCR with the following primers containing the T7 promoter sequence at the 5′-ends: 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTGCGGAGGAAAGAATGG-3′ (forward primer, 151–172 region of TIEG1 in boldface) and 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCAATGTGAGGTTTGGCAG-3′ (reverse primer, 497–514 region of TIEG1 in boldface). The PCR cycling parameters were as follows: 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 59 °C, for 6 cycles followed by 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 67 °C, for 30 cycles. The TIEG1 cDNA was used to prepare double strand RNA in a T7 transcription reaction. TIEG1 double strand RNA was incubated with DNase I and RNase I, purified on Ambion's Transcription Reaction Filter Cartridge, and then digested with RNase III to generate siRNA 12–15 bp in length. The size of the siRNA was confirmed on a polyacrylamide gel. HL60 and THP1 cells (1 × 107 cells in 200 μl of RPMI/0.1 mm dithiothreitol/10 mm dextrose) were electroporated at 300 V, 125 microfarads with 0.1–1.0 μg of TIEG1 siRNA. The cells were transferred to Petri dishes containing 15 ml of RPMI 1640/10% fetal calf serum. PMA was added (100 mm final concentration) after 1 h, and the cells were incubated for 48 h and harvested, and total RNA was isolated and analyzed by the PCR with primers specific to TIEG1, CD11c, CD11d, Sp1, and glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The PCR products were subjected to gel electrophoresis, stained with Vistra Green, and analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of TIEG1 and CD11d was determined relative to GAPDH (detailed in the figure legends). To ensure that the PCRs were performed within the linear range of amplification, samples were analyzed at 21, 24, 27, 30, 36, and 39 cycles. RT-PCR—Total RNA from untransfected and transfected cells was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen Inc.) and amplified using the Advantage 2 PCR kit (Clontech). The–100 to–20 Region of the CD11d Promoter Controls Myeloid Specificity—We had previously shown that Sp1 binds in vitro within the –63 to –40 region of the CD11d promoter and that both Sp1 and Sp3 activate expression of CD11d in myeloid but not non-myeloid cells (15Noti J.D. Johnson A.K. Dillon J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8959-8969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vivo genomic footprint analysis revealed that this region can bind one or more proteins, and it was presumed that Sp proteins were bound (15Noti J.D. Johnson A.K. Dillon J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8959-8969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because Sp proteins are ubiquitous, we reasoned that myeloid-specific expression of CD11d might be influenced by other transcription factors binding adjacent to the Sp binding site. To define the location of other transcription factor binding sites, site-directed mutagenesis of the region spanning the Sp1 binding site was performed. A series of 5-bp mutations was introduced throughout an extended region contained on a reporter construct CD11d(–173/+74)-luc (which contains the –173 to +74 region of the CD11d promoter fused to the luciferase gene) and analyzed in transient transfection assays (Fig. 1A). Three of five mutations (located at sites –69,–61, and –34) significantly reduced CD11d expression in the myeloid cell lines THP1 and HL60, but not in the B cell line IM9 or the T cell line Jurkat (Fig. 1B). A fourth mutation (located at site –91) significantly reduced expression in HL60, THP1, and Jurkat cells but had no effect on expression in IM9 cells. A fifth mutation (located at site –51) reduced CD11d expression in all cell lines. Further evidence that myeloid-specific and nonspecific sites are clustered near the Sp1 binding site was demonstrated by transient transfection analysis of a luciferase reporter construct containing four copies of the –100 to –20 region of the CD11d promoter fused upstream of the enhancerless, minimal SV40 promoter in pGL3-Promoter. The –100 to –20 region increased SV40 promoter activity ∼6- to 7-fold in HL60 and THP1 cells, whereas its activity in Jurkat and IM9 cells was increased ∼2-fold (Fig. 2). Identification of TIEG1 by Yeast One-hybrid Analysis—To identify the transcription factors that interact at the essential sites within the –100 to –20 region, a yeast one-hybrid screen was performed. Four copies of the –100 to –20 region were ligated upstream of the his3 and lacZ genes in pHISi-1 and pLacZi, respective"
https://openalex.org/W1971369615,"The core oligosaccharide region of Klebsiella pneumoniae lipopolysaccharide contains some novel features that distinguish it from the corresponding lipopolysaccharide region in other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella. The conserved Klebsiella outer core contains the unusual trisaccharide 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo)-(2,6)-GlcN-(1,4)-GalUA. In general, Kdo residues are normally found in the inner core, but in K. pneumoniae, this Kdo residue provides the ligation site for O polysaccharide. The outer core Kdo residue can also be non-stoichiometrically substituted with an l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose (Hep) residue, another component more frequently found in the inner core. To understand the genetics and biosynthesis of core oligosaccharide synthesis in Klebsiella, the gene products involved in the addition of the outer core GlcN (WabH), Kdo (WabI), and Hep (WabJ) residues as well as the inner core HepIII residue (WaaQ) were identified. Non-polar mutations were created in each of the genes, and the resulting mutant lipopolysaccharide was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The in vitro glycosyltransferase activity of WabI and WabH was verified. WabI transferred a Kdo residue from CMP-Kdo onto the acceptor lipopolysaccharide. The activated precursor required for GlcN addition has not been identified. However, lysates overexpressing WabH were able to transfer a GlcNAc residue from UDP-GlcNAc onto the acceptor GalUA residue in the outer core. The core oligosaccharide region of Klebsiella pneumoniae lipopolysaccharide contains some novel features that distinguish it from the corresponding lipopolysaccharide region in other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella. The conserved Klebsiella outer core contains the unusual trisaccharide 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo)-(2,6)-GlcN-(1,4)-GalUA. In general, Kdo residues are normally found in the inner core, but in K. pneumoniae, this Kdo residue provides the ligation site for O polysaccharide. The outer core Kdo residue can also be non-stoichiometrically substituted with an l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose (Hep) residue, another component more frequently found in the inner core. To understand the genetics and biosynthesis of core oligosaccharide synthesis in Klebsiella, the gene products involved in the addition of the outer core GlcN (WabH), Kdo (WabI), and Hep (WabJ) residues as well as the inner core HepIII residue (WaaQ) were identified. Non-polar mutations were created in each of the genes, and the resulting mutant lipopolysaccharide was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The in vitro glycosyltransferase activity of WabI and WabH was verified. WabI transferred a Kdo residue from CMP-Kdo onto the acceptor lipopolysaccharide. The activated precursor required for GlcN addition has not been identified. However, lysates overexpressing WabH were able to transfer a GlcNAc residue from UDP-GlcNAc onto the acceptor GalUA residue in the outer core. Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important nosocomial pathogen and is implicated in diseases including urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and bacteremia (reviewed in Ref. 1Podschun R. Ullmann U. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 589-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is second only to Escherichia coli as the most common cause of Gram-negative sepsis. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide(s); OS, oligosaccharide(s); O-PS, O polysaccharide; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid; Hep, l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose; ORF, open reading frame; MS, mass spectrometry; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; ESI, electrospray ionization; d,d-Hep, d-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose. 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide(s); OS, oligosaccharide(s); O-PS, O polysaccharide; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid; Hep, l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose; ORF, open reading frame; MS, mass spectrometry; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; ESI, electrospray ionization; d,d-Hep, d-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose. of K. pneumoniae serves as an important virulence factor. It has been shown that isolates of serotypes O1 and O2 during growth release an extracellular toxic complex composed of LPS, capsule, and a small amount of protein. The extracellular toxic complex is associated with the extensive lung damage and high lethality typically seen in mice with pneumonia derived from Klebsiella (2Straus D.C. Atkisson D.L. Garner C.W. Infect. Immun. 1985; 50: 787-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Straus D.C. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 44-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of virulence and pathology can be directly correlated with the amount of LPS in the complexes, whereas an increase in the amount of extracellular capsule has no effect (4Domenico P. Diedrich D.L. Straus D.C. Can. J. Microbiol. 1985; 31: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As might be expected for a member of the Enterobacteriaceae, K. pneumoniae LPS shares significant similarity with the well characterized LPS structures of E. coli and Salmonella (5Holst O. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar, 6Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). In all three species, LPS is subdivided into three regions: 1) lipid A, the hydrophobic membrane anchor; 2) a core oligosaccharide (OS); and 3) a polymer of glycosyl (repeat) units known as O polysaccharide (O-PS). The core OS region can be further subdivided on the basis of sugar composition into two regions, the inner and outer core (see Fig. 1B) (5Holst O. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar). The inner core region, which is generally well conserved in the Enterobacteriaceae, contains 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) and l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose (Hep). In contrast, the outer core region shows more diversity and is usually composed of hexose and acetamidohexose sugars in E. coli and Salmonella. The structures of the core OS of prototype isolates representing the different serotypes of K. pneumoniae have been determined (7Vinogradov E. Perry M.B. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 335: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The basic core structure is identical in all the serotypes examined; they differ only in the amounts and positions of non-stoichiometric sugar substitutions (7Vinogradov E. Perry M.B. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 335: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The core OS of K. pneumoniae does have some features that distinguish it from the E. coli and Salmonella paradigms (see Fig. 1B). The inner core of K. pneumoniae LPS is made up of the Hep-Kdo backbone seen in other members of the Enterobacteriaceae. In E. coli and Salmonella, the Hep residues are further substituted with phosphate and phosphorylethanolamine (5Holst O. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar). The negative charge provided by these residues plays an important role in maintenance of the barrier function of the outer membrane by providing sites for cross-linking of adjacent LPS molecules with divalent cations (reviewed in Ref. 6Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). K. pneumoniae LPS lacks these phosphate residues, a feature also seen in the LPS of Rhizobium etli and Rhizobium leguminosarum (8Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2747-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and Plesiomonas shigelloides O54 (9Niedziela T. Lukasiewicz J. Jachymek W. Dzieciatkowska M. Lugowski C. Kenne L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11653-11663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is thought that the carboxyl groups of the GalUA sugars in the core may provide the negative charge needed for outer membrane stability. The first residue of the outer core of K. pneumoniae is GalUA. The gene required for the addition of this GalUA residue (wabG) has been identified, and mutants lacking wabG show enhanced sensitivity to hydrophobic compounds (10Izquierdo L. Coderch N. Piqué N. Bedini E. Corsaro M.M. Merino S. Fresno S. Tomás J.M. Regué M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 7213-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The outer core backbone contains another unusual structural motif, the trisaccharide Kdo-(2,6)-GlcN-(1,4)-GalUA. Kdo is generally confined to the inner core, but in K. pneumoniae, it provides the ligation site for O-PS and can also be further substituted with a non-stoichiometric Hep residue (11Vinogradov E. Frirdich E. MacLean L.L. Perry M.B. Petersen B.O. Duus J.O. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25070-25081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Hep residues are typically confined to the inner core. As a result, the enzymology of K. pneumoniae core OS biosynthesis is considerably different from that of the well characterized E. coli and Salmonella systems. These novel characteristics may be important for the development of novel therapeutic strategies or vaccines against this prevalent nosocomial pathogen. Furthermore, elucidation of the biosynthesis pathway may provide insight into the LPS assembly of other bacteria with outer cores containing Kdo. The genes responsible for core OS biosynthesis in K. pneumoniae are encoded by the waa gene cluster, whose sequence has been reported (12Regué M. Climent N. Abitiu N. Coderch N. Merino S. Izquierdo L. Altarriba M. Tomás J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3564-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The transferases of known function are shown in Fig. 1. Genes responsible for inner core synthesis are readily identified by conserved sequences shared with E. coli and Salmonella, and the enzymology of the biosynthesis of the K. pneumoniae Hep-Kdo inner core backbone has been verified (13Noah C. Brabetz W. Gronow S. Brade H. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 25-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary structural analysis of a non-polar waaE mutant indicates that WaaE is involved in the addition of the inner core β-Glc residue (14Izquierdo L. Merino S. Coderch N. Regué M. Tomás J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 216: 211-216PubMed Google Scholar) and that WabG is required for the addition of the initial GalUA residue of the outer core (10Izquierdo L. Coderch N. Piqué N. Bedini E. Corsaro M.M. Merino S. Fresno S. Tomás J.M. Regué M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 7213-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The functions of the remaining transferases have not been assigned. The objective of this study was to resolve the biosynthesis of the outer core OS and to specifically identify the transferases involved in the addition of the novel GlcN, Kdo, and Hep residues. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are summarized in Table I. Bacteria were grown in LB broth at 37 °C (15Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1992Google Scholar). The growth media were supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml), gentamycin (30 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), or tetracycline (15 μg/ml) as necessary. YEG-Cl (0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, 0.4% glucose, 0.2% p-chloro-phenylalanine) plates were used as a counterselection method when using the suicide vector pWQ173 to construct allelic exchange mutants (16Kast P.

(18Hull R.A. Gill R.E. Hsu P. Minshew B.H. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1981; 33: 933-938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by using DNAzol reagent (Invitrogen) in a modified protocol for bacteria. Briefly, the cells from 1.5 ml of an overnight culture were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in ∼0.05 ml of culture supernatant. 1 ml of DNAzol was added to the cell suspension, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cell debris was removed by two 10-min centrifugation steps at 16,100 × g, and then 0.5 ml of cold 100% ethanol was added to the lysate and mixed by inversion. After a 0.5–1 h incubation at room temperature, the precipitated DNA was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 16 100 × g. The DNA pellet was washed two times with cold 70% ethanol, air-dried, and dissolved overnight in ∼0.03 ml of distilled H2O. PCR amplification was performed in 0.05-ml volumes with either PwoI DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) or Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) under conditions optimized for the primer pair. All PCR products were sequenced to verify that they were error-free. Restriction endonuclease digestions and ligation reactions were performed using standard methods as directed by the manufacturer. Plasmids were maintained in E. coli DH5α, except for pWQ173 derivatives, which were transformed into E. coli HB101. For E. coli strains, transformation was carried out by electroporation following methods described elsewhere (19Binotto J. MacLachlan P.R. Sanderson P.R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1991; 37: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For some K. pneumoniae strains, a modification of this method was required (20Enderle P.J. Farwell M.A. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, colonies were scraped off an LB plate (after overnight growth) and resuspended in 0.04 ml of cold distilled H2O. Plasmid DNA was added to the cells, and the DNA/cell suspension was then transferred to an electroporation cuvette for electroporation as described above. In Vitro Mutagenesis and Allelic Exchange—Individual genes were mutated by insertion of a non-polar antibiotic resistance cassette into the target open reading frame (ORF). The same strategy was used for each mutation. The non-polar cassette used was the aphA-3 (kanamycin) resistance cassette from plasmid pYA3265 (21Menard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), and it was cloned in the same orientation for transcription as the target gene. The mutated gene was transferred to the chromosome by homologous recombination using the temperature-sensitive suicide delivery vector pWQ173 containing the counterselectable marker pheS as described previously (17Rahn A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1045-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Mutations were made in waaQ, wabH, wabI, and wabJ. The plasmids containing waaQ::aphA-3 (pWQ47), wabH::aphA-3 (pWQ39), wabI::aphA-3 (pWQ33), and wabJ::aphA-3 (pWQ36) were transformed into K. pneumoniae CWK2 or CWG399 (waaL) by electroporation, as appropriate, for allelic exchange. Mutants were selected based on kanamycin resistance and chloramphenicol sensitivity, and the chromosomal mutations were confirmed by sequencing of the insertion junctions in an amplified PCR product. One representative mutant for each gene was selected for further analysis (Table I). The waaQ::aphA-3 mutant was constructed by first PCR-amplifying waaQ from K. pneumoniae CWK2 chromosomal DNA using KPwaa9 (5′-CGCCCTCGGTACCAATCGTGAT-3′) and KPwaa10 (5′-CCGCGCAGGTACCAGTCTTCAT-3′). The primers include KpnI sites (underlined). The 1673-bp PCR product was ligated using blunt ends to HincII-digested pGEM-5Zf(+). A recombinant plasmid was selected with the waaQ gene inserted in the same orientation as the T7 promoter of pGEM-5Zf(+) to form pWQ45. A HincII fragment carrying the aphA-3 cassette was inserted into HincII- and SmaI-digested pWQ45. The waaQ::aphA-3 gene was then removed as a 1834-bp KpnI fragment (using the sites introduced by the PCR primers) and cloned into pWQ173 to form pWQ47. To construct the wabH::aphA-3 mutant, the wabH coding region was PCR-amplified as a 1614-bp fragment from K. pneumoniae CWK2 chromosomal DNA with primers KPwaa35 (5′-GCCTGCACCAGGGATCCACTCTCAA-3′) and KPwaa37 (5′-GAGGGCAGGGGTACCAGTGGGAA-3′). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and KpnI at sites designed into the primers (underlined) and ligated to the similarly digested pBCSK(+) vector. This plasmid was digested with BglII at a single site within the wabH ORF and ligated to the aphA-3 cassette digested from pYA3265 with BamHI. The 2473-bp wabH::aphA-3 gene was then removed as a BamHI-KpnI fragment and ligated to the suicide delivery vector pWQ173 using the same sites to construct pWQ39. To construct the wabI::aphA-3 mutant, the coding region was first PCR-amplified from K. pneumoniae CWK2 chromosomal DNA using primers KPwaaC1 (5′-GCTGGCAGGAGCTTCTAGATCTGCTG-3′) and KPwaa2 (5′-AGGCGAAGCAGGTACCCTGTGAAGA-3′). The 2588-bp PCR product was digested with XbaI and KpnI at sites introduced by the primers (underlined) and ligated to the similarly digested pBCSK(+) vector. The resulting plasmid was digested with EcoRV at a single site within the wabI ORF and ligated to the HincII fragment containing the aphA-3 cassette from pYA3265. The wabI::aphA-3 gene was removed from pBCSK(+) as a 3425-bp XbaI-KpnI fragment and ligated to the equivalent sites in the suicide delivery vector pWQ173, generating pWQ33. For the wabJ::aphA-3 mutant, wabJ was PCR-amplified from K. pneumoniae CWK2 chromosomal DNA using KPwaa3 (5′-GCGCCTGAGCATCTGGATCCATAC-3′) and KPwaa4 (5′-GCGGCAATGTGGTACCGATGAA-3′). The 1485-bp PCR product was digested with BamHI and KpnI at sites introduced by the primers (underlined) and ligated to pBCSK(+) digested with the same enzymes. The plasmid was digested with HincII and ligated to the HincII fragment carrying the aphA-3 cassette. The wabJ::aphA-3 gene was removed as a 2048-bp BamHI-KpnI fragment and cloned into the suicide delivery vector pWQ173 using the same sites, generating pWQ36. Plasmid Constructs for Mutant Complementation Studies—For complementation, each gene was expressed using a pBAD vector derivative in the relevant mutant strain. Plasmid pBAD18-Cm belongs to a family of expression vectors that uses the arabinose-inducible and glucose-repressible promoter (22Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar). Repression from the araC promoter was achieved by growth in medium containing 0.4% (w/v) glucose, and induction was obtained by adding l-arabinose to a final concentration of 0.02% (w/v). Briefly, a culture was grown for 18 h at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin and 0.4% glucose. This culture was diluted 1:100 in fresh medium (without glucose) and grown until the culture reached A600 nm = 0.2. l-Arabinose was then added, and the culture was grown for another 2 h. Repressed controls were maintained in glucose-containing medium. For expression of the waaQ coding region, the waaQ ORF was removed from pWQ45 as a KpnI fragment (KpnI sites were introduced into the primers used to PCR-amplify waaQ) and ligated to pBAD18-Cm to form pWQ48. The wabJ gene was PCR-amplified from K. pneumoniae CWK2 chromosomal DNA with primers KPwaa30 (5′-GGAAACCTGGGTGCTGTTCT-3′) and KPwaa42 (5′-AGCAGGGCTAGCACCGCCTG-3′). The 1150-bp PCR product was digested with NheI (site underlined) and ligated to pBAD18-Cm digested with NheI and SmaI to generate plasmid pWQ43. The wabI gene was amplified from K. pneumoniae CWK2 chromosomal DNA using primers KPwaa38 (5′-GCTGCTCATATGGGATCCCTGTTTAAGAGGG-3′) and KPwaa39 (5′-CAATCGAGTAAGCTTGTCTGGCGAA-3′). The 994-bp PCR product was digested with NdeI and HindIII (sites underlined) and ligated to the same sites in pET28a(+) to make plasmid pWQ40. This plasmid expresses WabI with an in-frame His6 tag fused to the N terminus. For complementation studies and to verify whether the plasmid His6-tagged WabI was still functional, pWQ42 was constructed with the insert from pWQ40 cloned into pBAD18-Cm to facilitate expression in K. pneumoniae. The wabH gene was PCR-amplified from K. pneumoniae CWK2 chromosomal DNA with primers KPwaa43 (5′-GCCTGCACCAGCTAGCGACTCTCA-3′) and KPwaa37 (5′-GAGGGCAGGGGTACCAGTGGGAA-3′) as a 1613-bp fragment. The PCR product was digested with NheI and KpnI (sites underlined) and ligated to the same sites in pBAD18-Cm to make plasmid pWQ44. Preparation of Cell-free Extracts Containing WabI—The His6-WabI protein was overexpressed from pWQ40 in E. coli BL21(λDE3). This strain was grown for 18 h at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin. The culture was then diluted 1:100 in fresh medium, and incubation was continued until the culture reached A600 nm = 0.6. Expression of His6-WabI was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the culture at a final concentration of 1 mm and continuing incubation for another 3 h. The cells were harvested, washed once with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and then frozen until needed. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and sonicated on ice (for a total of 2 min using 10-s bursts followed by 10-s cooling periods). Unbroken cells, cell debris, and the membrane fraction were removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. For comparison, a soluble extract was prepared using the same protocol from E. coli BL21(λDE3) containing the pET28(+) vector. Protein expression was monitored by SDS-PAGE, and protein contents of the pET28(+) and pWQ40(His6-WabI+) lysates were determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford assay as directed by the manufacturer. Purification of His6-WabI—The His6-WabI protein was overexpressed from pWQ40 in E. coli BL21(λDE3), and the soluble extract was prepared as described above, except that the pellet was washed and resuspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 500 mm NaCl (buffer A). His6-WabI was purified on an ÄKTA Explorer 100 system (Amersham Biosciences) using a 1-ml HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) previously loaded with nickel sulfate and equilibrated with buffer A as recommended by the manufacturer. The column was washed with 5 mm imidazole in buffer A for 10 column volumes, and a step gradient of 50–500 mm imidazole in buffer A was then applied. His6-WabI eluted from the column at an imidazole concentration of 300 mm. The buffer was exchanged into 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) with 50 mm NaCl using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein was concentrated using a Centriplus 10-ml YM-30 centrifugal filter device (Amicon Bioseparations), and typical protein preparations contained yields of ∼0.07 mg/ml as determined by the Bio-Rad Bradford assay. Preparation of Cell-free Extracts Containing WabH—The K. pneumoniae strain CWG603 (waaL wabH) was used to overexpress the WabH protein from pWQ44. Cultures of CWG603(pWQ44) and the CWG603(pBAD18-Cm) control were grown for 18 h at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with chloramphenicol and kanamycin. The culture was then diluted 1:100 in fresh medium, and incubation was continued until the culture reached A600 nm = 0.2. Expression from the pBAD promoter was induced by adding l-arabinose (0.02% final concentration), and incubation was continued for another 3–4 h. The cells were harvested, washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and then frozen until needed. Lysates were prepared as described for WabI. Purification of CMP-Kdo Synthetase (KdsB)—Plasmid pJKB72 (23Gronow S. Brabetz W. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6602-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was transformed into E. coli LE392 for overexpression of KdsB. The purification procedure was a modification of that described elsewhere (23Gronow S. Brabetz W. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6602-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The strain was grown for 18 h at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin. The culture was then diluted 1:100 in fresh medium and grown until it reached A600 nm = 0.6. Expression of KdsB was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the culture at a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and incubation was continued for another 3.5 h. The cells were harvested and washed once with 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl (buffer B), and then the pellet was frozen until required. The frozen pellet was thawed on ice and resuspended in lysis buffer (buffer B containing 20 mm imidazole). RNase and DNase were added to final concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml. The cells were lysed by passage through a French pressure cell four times. MgCl2 was then added to the lysate at a final concentration of 1 mm. Unbroken cells and large cell debris were removed from the lysate by high speed centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 × g. Cell membranes were removed by ultracentrifugation for 90 min at 100,000 × g. Protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) were added to the supernatant and dissolved. Next, 1 ml of 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid suspension (QIAGEN Inc.) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 90 min at 4 °C on a rotary shaker. The lysate/nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid mixture was then loaded onto a disposable plastic column (5 ml) with elution by gravity flow. The column was washed twice with 10 column volumes of buffer B containing 40 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with buffer B containing 250 mm imidazole, and ∼2 ml of eluate was collected in 0.25-ml fractions. The fractions were e"

In the final steps of glycogenolysis, intracellular glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) is transported into the endoplasmic reticulum where it is hydrolyzed to glucose by glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase). Although the majority of body glycogen is stored in the muscle, the current dogma holds that Glc-6-Pase (now named Glc-6-Pase-α) is expressed only in the liver, kidney, and intestine, implying that muscle glycogen cannot contribute to interprandial blood glucose homeostasis. Recently we reported a second Glc-6-P hydrolase, Glc-6-Pase-β. Glc-6-Pase-β shares kinetic and structural similarities to Glc-6-Pase-α and couples with the Glc-6-P transporter to form an active Glc-6-Pase complex (Shieh, J.-J., Pan, C.-J., Mansfield, B. C., and Chou, J. Y. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 47098–47103). Here we demonstrate that muscle expresses both Glc-6-Pase-β and Glc-6-P transporter and that they can couple to form an active Glc-6-Pase complex.

This complex is composed of a Glc-6-P transporter (Glc-6-PT) that transports Glc-6-P from the cytoplasm into the lumen of the ER and a Glc-6-Pase catalytic subunit that hydrolyzes the Glc-6-P to glucose and phosphate. Together they contribute, along with other factors, to the maintenance of blood glucose homeostasis. The Glc-6-PT is encoded by a single copy gene (3Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y.

The Glc-6-Pase-α/Glc-6-PT complex is crucial for glucose homeostasis, and disruption of either component results in glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia, Glc-6-Pase-α deficiency) or type Ib (GSD-Ib, Glc-6-PT deficiency). Both GSD-Ia and -Ib patients manifest the symptoms of failed Glc-6-P hydrolysis, characterized by a loss of blood glucose homeostasis and disorders of glycogen and lipid metabolism (reviewed in Refs. 1Chou J.Y.

Like Glc-6-Pase-α, Glc-6-Pase-β is an integral membrane protein in the ER, containing nine transmembrane domains (15Ghosh A. Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12479-12483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, the active-site structures of Glc-6-Pase-α and -β are similar, and both form covalently bound phosphoryl-enzyme intermediates during catalysis (15Ghosh A. Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Chou J.Y. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32837-32842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Glc-6-Pase-β also couples functionally with the Glc-6-PT to form an active Glc-6-Pase complex that hydrolyzes Glc-6-P to glucose (10Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition to Glc-6-PT, Glc-6-Pase-α can couple functionally with vGlc-6-PT (6Lin B. Pan C.-J. Chou J.Y. Hum. Genet. 2000; 107: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although it is assumed that Glc-6-Pase-β can also couple to vGlc-6-PT, this remains to be demonstrated.Despite disruption of the Glc-6-Pase-α complex in GSD-I patients, several studies (17Powell R.C. Wentworth S.M. Brandt I.K. Metabolism. 1981; 30: 443-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Tsalikian E. Simmons P. Gerich J.E. Howard C. Haymond M.W. Am. J.

Dis. 1990; 13: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) indicate that GSD-Ia patients are still capable of producing glucose. In light of the discovery of Glc-6-Pase-β, this implies that non-gluconeogenic tissues may be contributing to interprandial glucose homeostasis through the activity of a Glc-6-Pase-β/Glc-6-PT or a Glc-6-Pase-β/vGlc-6-PT complex. Because the largest reservoir of glycogen in the body is muscle, we examined whether muscle possesses functional Glc-6-Pase-β and Glc-6-PT activities. Our findings are consistent with our hypothesis that endogenous glucose production in GSD-Ia patients is mediated, at least in part, by the muscle Glc-6-Pase-β complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Mouse Glc-6-Pase-β cDNA—The entire coding region of mouse Glc-6-Pase-β was isolated by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of mouse kidney RNA using oligonucleotide primers derived from nucleotides 232–258 (5′-ATGGAGTCCACGCTGAGCGCGGGCATC-3′, sense) and nucleotides 1253–1272 (5′-TCAAGAGGAGCGAATGGGCG-3′, antisense) of mouse Glc-6-Pase-β mRNA (GenBank™ accession number XM_126488). The PCR product was cloned into the pSVL vector to generate pSVL-mGlc-6-Pase-β and the pGEM-11Z vector to generate pGEM-11Z-mGlc-6-Pase-β.Construction of Recombinant Adenoviral vGlc-6-PT—Recombinant adenoviruses containing the human vGlc-6-PT (6Lin B.

The recombinant virus was plaque-purified and amplified to produce viral stocks with titers of ∼5–10 × 109 plaque-forming unit/ml. Recombinant adenoviruses, containing human Glc-6-Pase-α (Ad-Glc-6-Pase-α) and human Glc-6-Pase-β (Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β), have been described (10Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

Weaned mice were also given unrestricted access to mouse chow (Zeigler Bros., Inc., Gardners, PA). Microsomes were isolated from the leg muscle and liver of 6–7-week-old mice essentially as described (8Shelly L.L. Lei K.-J. Pan C.-J. Sakata S.F. Ruppert S. Schutz G. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

Each microsomal preparation represents one individual mouse, and at least three independent microsomal preparations were used for each assay.Phosphohydrolase and Glc-6-P Uptake Analyses—Phosphohydrolase activity was determined essentially as described previously (10Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Glc-6-Pase-β in muscle microsomes was assayed at the optimal temperature of 37 °C, and Glc-6-Pase-α in hepatic microsomes was assayed at 30 °C, although Glc-6-Pase-α activities differ very little between 30 and 37 °C (10Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mm Glc-6-P, and appropriate amounts of microsomal preparations were incubated at either 37 or 30 °C for 10 min. Disrupted microsomal membranes were prepared by incubating intact microsomes in 0.2% deoxycholate for 20 min at 0 °C. Nonspecific phosphatase activity was estimated by preincubating disrupted microsomal preparations at pH 5 for 10 min at 37 °C to inactivate the acid-labile Glc-6-Pase-α and -β.Glc-6-P uptake measurements were performed as described (3Hiraiwa H.

Briefly, microsomes (40 μg) were incubated in a reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 250 mm sucrose, and 0.2 mm [U-14C]Glc-6-P (50 μCi/μmol). The reaction was stopped at the appropriate time by filtering immediately through a nitrocellulose membrane (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell) and washing with an ice-cold solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 250 mm sucrose. The radioactivity measured within the microsomes represents both the translocated substrate, [U-14C]Glc-6-P, and its hydrolytic product, [U-14C]glucose, produced by the Glc-6-Pase activity localized within the lumen of the ER. Microsomes permeabilized with 0.2% deoxycholate to abolish Glc-6-P uptake were used as negative controls. 2–3 independent experiments were conducted, and at least three Glc-6-P uptake studies were performed for each microsomal preparation.Statistical analysis using the unpaired t test was performed with the Prism Program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E.Generation of Polyclonal Anti-Glc-6-Pase-β Antisera and Western Blot Analysis—To generate antibodies against Glc-6-Pase-β, nucleotides 445–558 of the coding sequence, encoding amino acids 71–114 of human Glc-6-Pase-β, were cloned into the pET-41a (+) vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and produced as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing a His6 tag at the C terminus. The recombinant Glc-6-Pase-β peptide was affinity-purified on a nickel chelate column and used to raise antibodies in New Zealand white rabbits. The antibodies recognize both human and mouse Glc-6-Pase-β efficiently.For Western blot analysis, mouse muscle microsomal proteins were resolved by electrophoresis through a 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and trans-blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated overnight with the rabbit anti-Glc-6-Pase-β antibody and then with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegarrd & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). The immunocomplex was visualized using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate from Pierce.RESULTSSkeletal Muscle Expresses Glc-6-Pase-β and Glc-6-PT—It has been shown that Glc-6-Pase-α is expressed primarily in the liver, kidney, and intestine (13Pan C.-J.

Northern hybridization analysis confirms that the leg muscles of wild-type and GSD-Ia (Glc-6-Pase-α-/-/Glc-6-PT+/+) (22Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Chou J.Y.

As anticipated, muscles of GSD-Ib mice (Glc-6-Pase-α+/+/Glc-6-PT-/-) (23Chen L.-Y. Shieh J.-J. Lin B. Pan C.-J. Gao J.-L. Murphy P.M. Roe T.F. Moses S. Ward J.M. Westphal H. Lee E.J. Mansfield B.C.

A polyclonal antibody, raised against amino acids 71–114 of human Glc-6-Pase-β, which also recognizes the in vitro expressed mouse Glc-6-Pase-β (Fig. 1B), detected the presence of the Glc-6-Pase-β protein in the leg muscles of wild-type, Glc-6-Pase-α-/-, and Glc-6-PT-/- mice (Fig. 1B).Glc-6-Pase-β Couples with vGlc-6-PT to Form an Active Glc-6-Pase Complex—We have shown previously that a functional Glc-6-Pase complex can be formed between Glc-6-Pase-α/Glc-6-PT (3Hiraiwa H.

Microsomes isolated from mock-infected COS-1 cells have a very low level of Glc-6-P uptake activity (data not shown). Microsomal Glc-6-P transport activity was increased significantly in COS-1 cells co-infected with Ad-vGlc-6-PT/Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β or Ad-vGlc-6-PT/Ad-Glc-6-Pase-α (Fig. 2A), which have similar time courses for microsomal Glc-6-P accumulation. The maximal Glc-6-P accumulation mediated by Glc-6-Pase-β/vGlc-6-PT is ∼37% that of Glc-6-Pase-α/vGlc-6-PT, consistent with the relative phosphohydrolase activity of Glc-6-Pase-β and -α (10Shieh J.-J.

As expected, COS-1 cells co-infected with Ad-Glc-6-PT/Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β or Ad-Glc-6-PT/Ad-Glc-6-Pase-α also have similar time courses and relative activities for microsomal Glc-6-P accumulation (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Glc-6-Pase-β couples with vGlc-6-PT to mediate microsomal Glc-6-P uptake.A, microsomal Glc-6-P uptake activity in COS-1 cells co-infected with Ad-vGlc-6-PT/Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β (○) or Ad-vGlc-6-PT/Ad-Glc-6-Pase-α (•).

Dominiczak M.H. Baynes J. Medical Biochemistry. Mosby, London1999: 139-155Google Scholar). Although muscle is known to express Glc-6-PT and vGlc-6-PT, it lacks Glc-6-Pase-α and was thought to be unable to contribute to blood glucose homeostasis. The discovery of Glc-6-Pase-β and its expression in the muscle led us to reexamine this tenet.A previous study (10Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) has shown that Glc-6-Pase-α and Glc-6-Pase-β are very similar. Both are acid-labile and inhibited readily by vanadate, although Glc-6-Pase-β shows a greater sensitivity to the inhibitor than Glc-6-Pase-α does. The activities share a common pH optimum of 6.5 but differ in their temperature profiles. Glc-6-Pase-α has similar activities at both 30 and 37 °C, whereas Glc-6-Pase-β activity at 37 °C is ∼1.5-fold higher than that of the activity at 30 °C (10Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Microsomes isolated from the leg muscles of wild-type mice have a detectable Glc-6-P hydrolase activity. Previous reports of such activities ascribed 80% of the activity to acid-resistant nonspecific phosphatases (26Gamberucci A. Marcolongo P. Fulceri R. Giunti R. Watkins S.L. Waddell I.D. Burchell A. Benedetti A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but the assays were performed under conditions optimal for Glc-6-Pase-α, namely 30 °C and pH 6.5. Because the optimal condition for Glc-6-Pase-β activity is 37 °C, pH 6.5 (10Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we performed assays at 37 °C to optimize for Glc-6-Pase-β. To exclude contributions from the acid-resistant nonspecific phosphatases we performed two measurements, one on disrupted microsomes to measure total phosphatase activity, and the other on disrupted microsomes preincubated at 37 °C, pH 5.0, for 10 min to measure the residual acid-resistant nonspecific phosphatases. The difference between these measurements reflects the acid-sensitive Glc-6-Pase-specific activity. In wild-type mouse muscle the initial Glc-6-P hydrolytic activity of 7.11 ± 0.32 nmol/mg/min is reduced to 1.74 ± 0.19 nmol/mg/min after acid incubation, yielding an acid-labile activity of 5.37 ± 0.32 nmol/mg/min (Table I), which should represent Glc-6-Pase-β. The acid-resistant hydrolytic activity measured here is consistent with previous measurements in other tissue microsomes (data not shown).Table IMuscle and liver acid-sensitive Glc-6-P phosphohydrolase activity Glc-6-P phosphohydrolase activity was assayed using three independent muscle or liver microsomal preparations. The assays for the liver enzyme were performed at pH 6.5 and 30 °C. The assays for the muscle enzyme were performed at pH 6.5 and 37 °C. For each tissue two measurements were made: one on disrupted microsomes to measure total phosphatase activity;the other on disrupted microsomes preincubated at pH 5.0, 37 °C for 10 min to measure the residual acid-resistant nonspecific phosphatases. The difference between these measurements reflects the acid-sensitive Glc-6-Pase specific activity.

The Glc-6-Pase-α-/- muscle had identical activity to the wild-type muscle excluding any contribution from Glc-6-Pase-α in the muscle (Table I).Glc-6-Pase-α is expected to be the predominant acid-labile Glc-6-P hydrolase activity in the liver (13Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Chen H. Ward J.M. Chou J.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar), whereas Glc-6-Pase-β is expected to be a minor component (9Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, there was a high level of Glc-6-Pase activity in the wild-type liver but no detectable activity in the Glc-6-Pase-α-/- liver (Table I). In the Glc-6-PT knock-out mouse, the Glc-6-PT-/- muscle had a similar activity to the wild-type and Glc-6-Pase-α-/- muscles, as would be expected for Glc-6-Pase-β. In contrast, the Glc-6-PT-/- liver microsomes had a 3.3-fold higher Glc-6-P hydrolase activity than the wild-type liver microsomes (Table I). This is not unexpected. The expression of Glc-6-Pase-α in rat hepatocytes is stimulated by extracellular glucose (27Massillon D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4055-4062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) mediated within the cell via Glc-6-P (27Massillon D. J. Biol.

In a Glc-6-PT-/- liver, cytoplasmic Glc-6-P levels are elevated markedly over wild-type levels, because Glc-6-P produced by glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glucose phosphorylation can not be transported into the lumen of the ER to be hydrolyzed to glucose (1Chou J.Y. Matern D. Mansfield B.C. Chen Y.-T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 121-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 2Chen Y.-T. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 1521-1551Google Scholar). Therefore the higher intracellular levels of Glc-6-P in the Glc-6-PT-/- liver are expected to elevate the Glc-6-Pase-α activity.To further support the identification of the labile muscle activity as Glc-6-Pase-β, the pH dependence (Fig. 3A) and vanadate sensitivity (Fig. 3B) of the Glc-6-Pase in muscle was compared with the hepatic Glc-6-Pase-α. Muscle Glc-6-Pase had a pH optimum of 6.5 (Fig. 3A), identical to the liver Glc-6-Pase-α, but vanadate inhibited the muscle Glc-6-Pase ((vanadate)0.5 = 1.3 mm) more effectively than hepatic Glc-6-Pase-α ((vanadate)0.5 = 2.9 mm) (Fig. 3B). These findings were totally consistent with profiles of Glc-6-Pase-β and -α obtained with adenoviral-mediated expression studies (10Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and further support the identity of the muscle Glc-6-Pase as Glc-6-Pase-β.Fig. 3The pH dependence and vanadate sensitivity of Glc-6-P phosphohydrolase activity.

A patient with inherited deficiency of the coagulation serine protease factor XI (FXI) was reported to be homozygous for a Gly555 → Glu substitution. Gly555 in FXI corresponds to Gly193 in chymotrypsin, which is the numbering system used subsequently. To investigate the abnormality in FXIG193E, we expressed and purified recombinant FXIaG193E, activated it to FXIaG193E, and compared its activity to wild type-activated FXI (FXIaWT). FXIaG193E activated FIX with ∼300-fold reduced kcat and similar Km, and hydrolyzed synthetic substrate with ∼10-fold reduced Km and modestly reduced kcat. Binding of antithrombin and the amyloid β-precursor protein Kunitz domain inhibitor (APPI) to FXIaG193E was impaired ∼8,000- and ∼100,000-fold, respectively. FXIaG193E inhibition by diisopropyl fluoro-phosphate was ∼30-fold slower and affinity for p-aminobenzamidine (S1 site probe) was 6-fold weaker than for FXIaWT. The rate of carbamylation of NH2-Ile16, which forms a salt bridge with Asp194 in active serine proteases, was 4-fold faster for FXIaG193E. These data indicate that the unoccupied active site of FXIaG193E is incompletely formed, and the amide N of Glu193 may not point toward the oxyanion hole. Inclusion of saturating amounts of p-aminobenzamidine resulted in comparable rates of carbamylation for FXIaWT and FXIaG193E, suggesting that the occupied active site has near normal conformation. Thus, binding of small synthetic substrates or inhibitors provides sufficient energy to allow the amide N of Glu193 to point correctly toward the oxyanion hole. Homology modeling also indicates that the inability of FXIaG193E to bind antithrombin/APPI or activate FIX is caused, in part, by impaired accessibility of the S2′ site because of a steric clash with Glu193. Such arguments will apply to other serine proteases with substitutions of Gly193 with a non-glycine residue."

Kinetic and cell-surface biotinylation assays showed that Par-4 inhibited CHT1-mediated choline uptake by reducing CHT1 expression in the plasma membrane without significantly altering the affinity of CHT1 for choline or HC-3.

Expression of the cholinergic neuronal phenotype in basal forebrain cultures was determined by measurement of the specific activity of ChAT in the cultures as described in our previous study (31Guo Q. Xie J. Du H. Brain Res. 2000; 874: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). ChAT activity is expressed as picomoles of acetylcholine synthesized per mg of total protein in a 30-min period. In addition, as a measure of physiological responsiveness of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated changes in ChAT activity were monitored, as it has been shown that NGF enhances the specific activity of this cholinergic phenotypic marker (31Guo Q. Xie J. Du H. Brain Res. 2000; 874: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Primary stocks of mouse 2.5 S NGF were made at 100 μg/ml in 0.02% acetic acid. Working solutions of NGF were prepared at 10 μg/ml in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Trophic factor withdrawal (TFW) was initiated by washing cultures four times with Locke's buffer (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2)) with subsequent incubation in Locke's buffer. An antisense Par-4 oligonucleotide (5′-ATAGCCGCCGGTCGCCATGTT-3′) was prepared as 1 mm stocks in sterile water and diluted directly into the culture medium. Transfection of Neuroblastoma IMR-32 Cells—For transfection of IMR-32 cells with hCHT1 cDNA, specific PCR primers (forward primer with added NotI cloning site, 5′-gcggccgccatggctttccatgtggaag-3′; and reverse primer with added XhoI cloning site, 5′-ctcgagtcactgtaaattatcttcagtcccag-3′; designed based on the nucleotide sequence of hCHT1 cDNA, GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number AF276871) were used to amplify the hCHT1 cDNA from human spinal cord cDNA template (Clontech). The PCR-amplified hCHT1 cDNA was subcloned into the NotI and XhoI sites of expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) and subsequently confirmed by sequencing. The expression construct was designated pCMV-hCHT1. A full-length Par-4 cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pREP4 (Invitrogen), yielding the recombinant construct pREP4-Par-4, which encodes a 1.2-kb RNA species and the full-length 38-kDa Par-4 protein (24Guo Q.

Another cDNA fragment representing the C-terminal half deletion mutant of Par-4 (Par-4ΔCTH, in which nucleotides 541–1267 in Par-4 cDNA were deleted) was similarly subcloned into the expression vector pREP4, yielding the recombinant construct pREP4-Par-4ΔCTH, which encodes a 700-bp RNA species and the N-terminal half (i.e. 163 amino acids, ∼18 kDa) of the Par-4 protein, as described in our previous studies (23Sells S.F. Han S.S. Muthukkumar S. Maddiwar N. Johnstone R. Boghaert E. Gillis D. Liu G. Nair P. Monnig S. Collini P. Mattson M.P. Sukhatme V.P. Zimmer S.G. Wood Jr., D.P. McRoberts J.W. Shi Y. Rangnekar V.M.

Human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Human IMR-32 cells were transfected with pCMV-hCHT1 or pREP4-Par-4 using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Additional IMR-32 cells were cotransfected with pREP4-Par-4 and pCMV-hCHT1. For mapping studies, IMR-32 cells were cotransfected with pREP4-Par-4ΔCTH and pCMV-hCHT1. For control purposes, parallel cultures of IMR-32 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 and/or pREP4 vectors alone. Transfected cells were selected with G418 (400 μg/ml; for cells transfected with pCMV-hCHT1) and/or hygromycin (400 μg/ml; for cells transfected with pREP4-Par-4) for 4 weeks. Surviving clones were selected for this study based on their similar levels of expression of hCHT1 and/or Par-4 as assessed by Western blotting. Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy— The affinity-purified rabbit anti-hCHT1 polyclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Takashi Okuda (University College London, London, United Kingdom). This antibody has been reported to be able to detect the CHT1 protein on Western blots as two major ∼45- and 80-kDa bands that represent oligomers and/or heterogeneous glycosylation of the CHT1 protein (32Kobayashi Y. Okuda T. Fujioka Y. Matsumura G. Nishimura Y. Haga T. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 317: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Okuda T. Okamura M. Kaitsuka C. Haga T. Gurwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45315-45322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In CHT1-transfected IMR-32 cells, the antibody recognized three major bands of ∼80, 68, and 45kDa. The 68-kDa band corresponds closely to the molecular mass predicted from hCHT1 primary structure (see “Results”). IMR-32 cells expressed little or no endogenous CHT1 (see “Results”). The anti-Par-4 antibody was a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against full-length rat Par-4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). This antibody recognizes both human and rodent Par-4 proteins at ∼38 kDa. For immunocytochemical analysis of hCHT1 and Par-4 expression, the cultured cells were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS, and membranes were permeabilized by incubation in 0.2% Triton X-100 and PBS. Cells were incubated for 1 h in blocking serum (5% normal goat serum in PBS). Cells were then exposed to primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-hCHT1 polyclonal antibody and 1:100 dilution of mouse anti-Par-4 monoclonal antibody) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation for 1 h with a mixture of Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit and fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Images of Par-4 and/or CHT1 immunofluorescence were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (dual wavelength scan) with a ×60 oil immersion objective. All images were acquired using the same laser intensity and photodector gain to allow quantitative comparisons of relative levels of fluorescence in the cells. The average pixel intensity/cell and sites of colocalization of immunoreactivities were determined using Fluoview Version 2.0 software. [3H]Choline Uptake Assay—[3H]Choline uptake assays were performed essentially as described previously (33Okuda T. Okamura M. Kaitsuka C. Haga T. Gurwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45315-45322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Ribeiro F.M. Alves-Silva J. Volknandt W. Martins-Silva C. Mahmud H. Wilhelm A. Gomez M.V. Rylett R.J. Ferguson S.S. Prado V.F. Prado M.A. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In brief, transfected IMR-32 cells were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer (130 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by an additional incubation in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer containing 1 μm [methyl-3H]choline chloride (83 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min. Choline uptake was terminated by washing cells three times with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer. The level of accumulated [3H]choline was determined by solubilizing cells in 1% SDS and 0.2 n NaOH, and radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter LS 6500). The sensitivity of [3H]choline uptake to HC-3 was assessed by measuring [3H]choline uptake in the presence of 1 μm HC-3. In these experiments, experimental data were normalized by protein content, and specific [3H]choline uptake is presented as percent uptake above background (background choline uptake was determined in cells transfected with the empty vectors alone). The Na+ dependence of [3H]choline uptake was assessed in buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm Tris, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4) using isotonic replacement of NaCl with LiCl as described previously (33Okuda T.

To analyze the effect of Par-4 on the choline uptake activity of hCHT1, IMR-32 cells were cotransfected with CHT1 and Par-4; the [3H]choline uptake activity of hCHT1 was analyzed at increasing concentrations of [3H]choline; and specific [3H]choline uptake was determined by subtracting the nonspecific uptake (as determined by the choline uptake in the presence of 1 μm HC-3) from the total uptake. Km for choline was calculated by nonlinear least-square fits using the Hill equation (SigmaPlot Version 8.0, SPSS Inc.). Immunoprecipitation/Western Blot Analysis—The methods used have been described previously (35Guo Q. Xie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4596-4603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In brief, to examine Par-4·CHT1 complex formation, aliquots of cell lysates containing 200 μg of protein were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with appropriate dilutions of mouse anti-Par-4 or rabbit anti-hCHT1 antibodies in immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6)). Protein A-Sepharose resin (30 μl/sample; Amersham Biosciences) was added to the extracts for collection of the immunocomplexes, which were then washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and solubilized by heating in Laemmli buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 4 min. 50 μg of solubilized proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 4–12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. For Western blot analysis, the nitrocellulose sheet was blocked with 5% milk, followed by 1-h incubation in the presence of anti-hCHT1 or anti-Par-4 primary antibody. The membrane was further processed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and immunoblotted proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). To further confirm that Par-4/CHT1 interaction was specific, similar immunoprecipitation/Western blotting methods were employed to examine whether Par-4 interacts with a similar transporter protein, the sodium/glucose cotransporter SGLT1, using a rabbit anti-SGLT1 polyclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Inc.). Equal loading was verified by probing the blots with anti-β-actin antibody. Western blot images were acquired and quantified using Kodak Image Station 2000R and Kodak Digital Science 1D Version 3.6 software. [3H]Hemicholinium-3 Binding Assay—[3H]HC-3 (128 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) binding experiments were performed using intact cells as described previously (33Okuda T. Okamura M. Kaitsuka C. Haga T. Gurwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45315-45322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In brief, transfected cells were washed with Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer and preincubated for 1–2hat 37 °C for equilibrium. Binding assays were performed at 4 °C for 1–2 h and terminated by three washes with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer. Saturation binding was determined using 0.1–10 nm [3H]HC-3 with or without 1 μm unlabeled HC-3. Specific binding was determined by subtracting binding in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled HC-3 from total binding. Because HC-3 is hydrophilic and cell membrane-impermeable, the HC-3 binding activity represents the expression level of the transporter in the plasma membrane (33Okuda T. Okamura M. Kaitsuka C. Haga T. Gurwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45315-45322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Kd for HC-3 was calculated by nonlinear least-square fits using the Hill equation (SigmaPlot Version 8.0). Cell-surface Biotinylation Assay—These assays were used to analyze the cell-surface expression of CHT1 because biotinylated proteins are considered to be mostly expressed on the cell surface since they are greatly depleted of the intracellular marker actin (33Okuda T. Okamura M. Kaitsuka C. Haga T. Gurwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45315-45322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The methods were essentially the same as described previously (33Okuda T. Okamura M. Kaitsuka C. Haga T. Gurwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45315-45322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were treated with sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (1 mg/ml; Pierce) in PBS/calcium/magnesium buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 9.6 mm Na2HPO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4)) at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by washing with 100 mm glycine in PBS/calcium/magnesium buffer. Cells were solubilized with assay buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) and then centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Biotinylated proteins were separated from non-biotinylated proteins by incubation with UltraLink™ Plus immobilized streptavidin gel (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were washed five times with 1 ml of assay buffer, and adsorbed proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 6% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue) for 30 min at room temperature. 500 μg of biotinylated proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 4–12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. Western blot analysis with anti-CHT1 or anti-SGLT1 antibody was then performed as described above. Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-actin antibody (Sigma), which was used as a marker for intracellular proteins. Immunoblot images were acquired and quantified using Kodak Image Station 2000R and Kodak Digital Science 1D 3.6 software. Par-4 Is Present in Basal Forebrain Cholinergic Neurons and Colocalizes in the Same Neuron Positive for the Cholinergic Marker CHT1—Primary neuronal cultures of different brain regions (cortical, hippocampal, cerebellar, and basal forebrain) were established, and expression of the cholinergic neuronal phenotype in basal forebrain cultures was confirmed by measurement of the specific activity of ChAT in the cultures as described in our previous study (31Guo Q. Xie J. Du H. Brain Res. 2000; 874: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, primary basal forebrain neuronal cultures showed the most significant amount of basal ChAT activity (an average of ∼3832 pmol/mg of protein/30 min) compared with cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar neuronal cultures. In addition, NGF-mediated changes in ChAT activity were also significantly greater in basal forebrain neuronal cultures than in cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar cultures (Fig. 1b). These results are consistent with the overall cholinergic phenotype of the basal forebrain neuronal cultures. Western blot analysis showed that basal levels of Par-4 were relatively high in the basal forebrain, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex and low in the cerebellum (Fig. 1, c and d). We next examined whether Par-4 colocalizes in the same basal forebrain neuron positive for the cholinergic marker CHT1. Immunocytochemical analysis of cultured basal forebrain cholinergic neurons revealed that both Par-4 and CHT1 were predominantly located in cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 1e). This observation is consistent with previous reports showing that, although CHT1 is constantly cycled through the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments, CHT1 is predominantly intracellular (33Okuda T.

Double labeling immunocytochemistry using confocal laser scanning microscope further showed significant colocalization between Par-4 and hCHT1 in the perikaryon and neurites (Fig. 1e). CHT1 Confers Na+-dependent, HC-3-sensitive Choline Uptake in IMR-32 Cells: Inhibition by Par-4 in Transfected IMR-32 Cells and in Basal Forebrain Neurons—Since Par-4 is present and colocalizes with CHT1 in cholinergic neurons, we next tested the hypothesis that Par-4 regulates the specific choline uptake activity of CHT1 in transfected human neurobla"

Although a great deal is known about the role of PrPSc in the disease process, the physiological function of PrPC has remained enigmatic. In this report, we have used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to test one hypothesized function of PrPC, as a receptor for the uptake or efflux of copper ions. We first modified the PrP signal peptide by replacing its hydrophobic core with the signal sequence from the yeast protein dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B, so that the resulting protein was targeted cotranslationally to the secretory pathway when synthesized in yeast. PrP molecules with the modified signal peptide were efficiently glycosylated, glycolipid-anchored, and localized to the plasma membrane. We then tested whether PrP expression altered the growth deficiency phenotypes of yeast strains harboring deletions in genes that encode key components of copper utilization pathways, including transporters, chaperones, pumps, reductases, and cuproenzymes. We found that PrP did not rescue any of these mutant phenotypes, arguing against a direct role for the protein in copper utilization.

Although a great deal has been learned about the PrPC-PrPSc conversion event and the role of PrPSc in the disease process, the normal function of PrPC has remained enigmatic. Identifying the function of PrPC may provide important clues to pathogenic mechanisms, because there is evidence that PrPC, in addition to serving as a precursor of PrPSc, acts as a mediator of PrPSc-induced neurotoxicity (3Brandner S.

A variety of functions have been proposed for PrPC, including roles in metal ion trafficking (6Pauly P.C. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

In addition, attempts to deduce the function of PrPC from the phenotypes of PrP-null mice have been unrewarding. Lines of these mice, in which the gene encoding Doppel (a PrP paralogue) is not artificially up-regulated, display no major anatomical or developmental deficits (11Büeler H. Fischer M. Lang Y.

McConnell I. Hope J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1994; 8: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), and the subtle phenotypic abnormalities that have been described in some of these lines have been controversial (13Collinge J.

In an effort to uncover the function of PrPC, we have been employing a novel approach, which makes use of the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous studies of prion biology have generally utilized model systems involving cultured mammalian cells or whole animals. Our strategy has been to express PrP in yeast in such as way that the protein is post-translationally processed and subcellularly localized as it is in mammalian cells. Then, we test the effect of PrP expression on the phenotype of wild-type yeast strains, or strains that harbor deletions of genes underlying a particular physiological pathway in which we hypothesize PrP is involved. Although the yeast genome does not encode a structural homologue of PrP, this organism may nevertheless express proteins that can interact physically and functionally with PrP to produce an observable phenotype. In addition, yeast contain proteins that are unrelated in primary sequence to PrP, but that display all the essential properties of prions, demonstrating strong evolutionary conservation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying prion-related conformational changes (15Uptain S.M. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 703-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These considerations, combined with facile genetics and ease of experimental manipulation, make yeast a potentially attractive model system for analysis of PrPC function, and possibly the mechanism of PrPSc formation. A proposed function of PrPC that is particularly amenable to investigation in yeast is the role of the protein in copper physiology. Much of what we know about cellular utilization of copper ions in eukaryotes is derived from studies of S. cerevisiae (16Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 17Eide D.J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2000; 43: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Labbé S. Thiele D.J. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 500-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Key transporters, reductases, chaperones, and cuproenzymes have been identified by genetic and biochemical means, and mutant yeast strains are available that are defective in various steps of copper uptake and delivery. In addition, there is strict conservation of copper handling pathways in yeast and mammalian cells. Almost all the proteins known to be involved in copper utilization in yeast have identified counterparts in mammals, and these homologues can substitute functionally for the yeast proteins. Finally, alterations in copper metabolism produce easily detectable, non-lethal pheno-types in yeast, making it relatively simple to assay the effects of expressed proteins. Several lines of evidence have emerged within the past few years suggesting a connection between PrPC and copper ions (19Brown L.R. Harris D.A. Massaro E.J.

Probably the most widely agreed upon fact is that PrPC binds copper ions. Cu2+ binds to the histidine-containing octapeptide repeats with low micromolar affinity in a pH-dependent fashion, and there is evidence for more C-terminal binding sites as well (21Burns C.S.

Copper ions at concentrations ≥100 μm rapidly and reversibly stimulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis of PrPC (6Pauly P.C. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33107-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 25Brown L.R. Harris D.A. J.

Biol. 2001; 11: 519-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and we have postulated that PrPC could function as a recycling receptor that plays a role in the cellular uptake or efflux of copper ions. A final set of observations has suggested a connection between PrPC, copper ions, and protection of cells from oxidative stress. For example, recombinant PrP refolded in the presence of copper has been reported to exhibit a superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (27Brown D.R. Wong B.-S. Hafiz F. Clive C. Haswell S.J. Jones I.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of studies indicate that the absence of PrPC results in increased sensitivity of neurons to several kinds of oxidative insults, a phenotype that may depend on binding of copper ions to PrPC (28Brown D.R. Nicholas R.S. Canevari L. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 29Brown D.R. Schulzschaeffer W.J. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Exp.

It has also been reported that the brains of Prn-p0/0 mice have a reduced content of ionic copper, and decreased enzymatic activity of Cu-Zn SOD (29Brown D.R. Schulzschaeffer W.J. Schmidt B.

In the first step of the work, we modified the PrP molecule so that it was efficiently targeted to the secretory pathway in yeast. We then tested whether PrP expression affected the phenotypes of yeast strains deleted for various genes involved in copper utilization. Our results shed light on the role of PrPC in copper physiology, and they lay the groundwork for using yeast expressing PrP to study other aspects of prion biology. Yeast Strains—Yeast strains were created by the Saccharomyces Deletion Project, and were obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). The wild-type yeast strains used were BY4742 (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0) and BY4743 (MATa/α his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0). These strains are derived from S288C, which carries a disrupted CTR3 gene (33Knight S.A.B. Labbé S. Kwon L.F. Kosman D.J. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The following deletion strains were used: Δctr1, Δctr2, Δcox17, Δatx1, Δccc2, Δfre1, Δfre2, Δzrt1 (BY4743 background); Δlys7, and Δsod1 (BY4742 background). Yeast were grown at 30 °C on rich medium containing glucose (YPD), rich medium containing glycerol (YPG), or synthetic complete media (SC) minus uracil. Plasmids—All proteins were expressed using the vector pVT102U, which contains a 2-micron origin of replication, a constitutive ADH promoter, and a uracil selection marker (34Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene. 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). To create PrP-(1-254), wild-type mouse PrP containing the 3F4 epitope (35Bolton D.C. Seligman S.J. Bablanian G. Windsor D. Scala L.J. Kim K.S. Chen C.M. Kascsak R.J. Bendheim P.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the following primers: CGCGGATCCATGTTGTTTAAATCCC (sense); GCACCCAAGCTTATCCCACGATCAGGAAGAT (antisense). The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pVT102U. To construct DPAPB-PrP254, we utilized the following PCR primers: CGCGGATCCACCATGAGGGTCGGAATAATCCTTGTACTCC TGATATGGGGCACTGTTTTGTTGCTATGGACTGATGTCGGCCTCTGCAAAAAG (sense); CGCGCGTCTAGACTATTATCCCACGATCAGGAAGAT (antisense). The sense primer encoded: 1) the first two residues (MR) of prepro-α-factor; 2) the signal anchor sequence (VGIILVLLIWGTVLLL) of DPAPB; 3) residues 16-22 (WTDVGLC) of the mouse PrP signal sequence. These primers were used to amplify a mouse PrP template containing the 3F4 epitope, and the resulting product was cloned into the BamH1 and XbaI sites of pVT102U. To create DPAPB-PrP230-Gas1p constructs, three different Gas1 C-terminal segments were amplified by PCR and substituted individually into the C terminus of DPAPB-PrP254 via the StuI and XbaI sites. The sense primers used were: GAAGGCCTATTACGACGGGAGAAGATCCAATGCTGCCACCAACGTT (Gas1p32); GAAGGCCTATTACGACGGGAGAAGATCCTCTTCAGCTTCA TCTTC (Gas1p43); and GAAGGCCTATTACGACGGGAGAAGATCCTCGGGGTCTTCTTCCAAG (Gas1p63). The antisense primer used for all three Gas1p segments had the following sequence: GCTCTAGACCCCACAATGAAATAAGATACCATACCTTATCGA. The coding region of canine calnexin was cloned into the XhoI and PstI sites of pVT102U. Yeast cells were transformed by electroporation (36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York2004Google Scholar). Protein Extraction and Western Blots—Yeast cells were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 min, and were suspended in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing a tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After addition of an equal volume of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma), the sample was vortexed at maximum speed for 30 s, and then incubated on ice for 30 s. The vortexing and incubation steps were repeated eight times, and the sample was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with SDS sample buffer, and after heating at 95 °C for 10 min, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. PrP was detected with 3F4 monoclonal antibody (35Bolton D.C. Seligman S.J. Bablanian G. Windsor D. Scala L.J. Kim K.S. Chen C.M. Kascsak R.J. Bendheim P.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Doppel protein with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (37Quaglio E. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11432-11438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and canine calnexin with an antibody from Stressgen (Vancouver, Canada). Proteins were visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Endo H and α-Mannosidase Treatments—Yeast extracts prepared as described above were incubated with endo H (New England Biolabs, Beverly MA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Some samples were then treated for 16 h at 37 °C with 50 units/ml of jack bean α-mannosidase (Glyko, Novato, CA) in the presence of 2 mm ZnSO4. Samples were subjected to Western blotting with anti-PrP antibody. Preparation of Yeast Microsomes and Analysis of PrP Topology—Yeast microsomes were prepared by sucrose gradient centrifugation (38Rothblatt J.A. Meyer D.I. Cell. 1986; 44: 619-628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The membrane topology of PrP was analyzed by a proteinase K (PK) protection assay, performed as described previously for mammalian microsomes (39Stewart R.S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2212-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Phospholipase Treatment and Triton X-114 Partitioning—Yeast were lysed in PBS plus protease inhibitors using glass beads as described above. The supernatants were incubated with Triton X-114 (1% final concentration) for 30 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 11,700 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was removed to a clean tube and warmed to 37 °C for 20 min to induce detergent condensation, after which the sample was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature to separate the phases. The detergent phase was collected, diluted 10-fold with ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors, and divided into two equal aliquots. One aliquot was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 0.04 units/ml of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) from B. thuringiensis (Sigma), and the other aliquot was incubated the same way without PIPLC. After incubation, phase separation was induced as above, and proteins in the aqueous and detergent phases were precipitated with methanol and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Radiolabeling and Immunoprecipitation—Yeast cells grown to midlog phase in YPD medium were washed three times with SC-ura medium lacking either methionine or inositol and were then resuspended at a density of 5 OD600 units/ml in the same medium. Cells were preincubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and then labeled for 3 h with either [35S]methionine (250 μCi/ml, Promix, Amersham Biosciences) or [myo-2-3H]inositol (100 μCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences). At the end of the labeling period, metabolism was stopped by the addition of NaN3 and NaF (each to a final concentration of 10 mm), after which cells were placed on ice. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once in 10 mm NaN3/NaF, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors. Yeast cells were lysed with glass beads as described above. Clarified supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 3F4 antibody, and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Immunofluorescent Staining—Staining was performed as described (40Zhang Y. Nijbroek G. Sullivan M.L. McCracken A.A. Watkins S.C. Michaelis S. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Log-phase cells were fixed for 1 h at room temperature by addition of paraformaldehyde to a final concentration of 3.7%. Cells were washed twice with sorbitol buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, 1.0 m sorbitol, pH 7.5), and then suspended at a concentration of 108 cells/ml in sorbitol buffer containing 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol and 20 μg/ml zymolase 20T (Seikagaku America, Falmouth, MA). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, cells were washed twice with sorbitol buffer, and were applied to poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides with wells (20 μl/well). Cells were blocked in 5% goat serum in PBS for 1 h, and then incubated with 3F4 antibody (1:500) for1hat room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa 488-coupled, anti-mouse IgG (1:250) for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed three more times with PBS. Slides were coverslipped using Cytoseal (EM Sciences, Gibbstown, NJ) and viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with an Axiovert 200 laser scanning system. Analysis of PK Resistance and Detergent Insolubility—To assay PK resistance, yeast were lysed in buffer P (PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% Sarkosyl) using glass beads. After a brief centrifugation to remove debris, lysates representing 200-800 μg of protein were incubated with PK (0-4 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in final volume of 250 μl. Digestion was terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 5 mm. Proteins were then precipitated by methanol and PrP analyzed by Western blotting. To assay detergent insolubility, yeast were lysed in buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 11,700 × g for 2 min to remove debris, and then the supernatant was centrifuged at 186,000 × g for 45 min. Proteins in the supernatant (recovered by methanol precipitation) and the pellet from the second centrifugation were subjected to Western blotting using 3F4 antibody. Targeting of PrP to the Yeast Secretory Pathway—In order to use yeast as a model system to study the function of PrP, it is first necessary to target the protein to the secretory pathway so that it is glycosylated, GPI-anchored, and localized to the plasma membrane, as it is in mammalian cells. The primary sequence of PrP contains two signals that play a role in its biosynthesis: an N-terminal signal peptide of 22 amino acids that is responsible for cotranslational import into the ER, and a C-terminal signal peptide of 23 amino acids that is required for attachment of the GPI anchor. We first tried to express PrP in yeast with its endogenous N- and C-terminal signal peptides (Fig. 1, PrP1-254). A single PrP band of 30 kDa was observed on SDS-PAGE, and this band was not shifted when samples were treated with endo H (Fig. 2A, lane 6 and data not shown). This result indicates that native PrP is not significantly glycosylated when expressed in yeast, possibly because it remains in the cytoplasm and does not enter the secretory pathway. PrP also remained unglycosylated when its N-terminal signal sequence was replaced with those of either yeast prepro-α-factor or Gas1p (data not shown).Fig. 2PrP containing a modified signal peptide is glycosylated in yeast. A, yeast cells were transformed with plasmids encoding the indicated PrP constructs, or with the vector alone. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with the anti-PrP antibody 3F4. B, lysates of yeast cells expressing the indicated PrP constructs were left untreated (lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10), or were treated with endo H (lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11), or with endo H plus α-mannosidase (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12) prior to immunoblotting with 3F4 antibody. Molecular mass markers for all panels are given in kilodaltons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In mammalian cells, almost all secretory proteins enter the ER cotranslationally via an SRP-dependent mechanism (41Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In yeast, however, two pathways for ER targeting exist: a cotranslational pathway that is SRP-dependent, and a post-translational pathway that is independent of SRP (42Zheng N. Gierasch L.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 849-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A major determinant of whether a protein follows the co- or post-translational pathway is the sequence of the N-terminal signal peptide (43Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that PrP might not enter the secretory pathway in yeast because its N-terminal signal peptide is not recognized as a co-translational ER targeting signal, resulting in synthesis of the entire polypeptide chain in the cytoplasm. In this case, the polypeptide chain might misfold and fail to enter the ER. To target PrP to the cotranslational pathway, we replaced part of its native signal sequence with the signal anchor sequence from the yeast enzyme dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B (DPAPB), a type II transmembrane protein (44Roberts C.J. Pohlig G. Rothman J.H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, DPAPB-PrP254). It has been shown that translocation of DPAPB is strongly dependent on SRP and that transfer of its signal anchor sequence onto the N terminus of heterologous proteins can switch their ER targeting from the post-translational to the cotranslational mode (43Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). We fused the DPAPB signal anchor sequence of 16 amino acids to the last 7 amino acids of the PrP signal sequence, because computer analysis using the program SignalP (45Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) predicted that the resulting hybrid molecule would be cleaved by signal peptidase at the normal site utilized in endogenous PrP (between cysteine 22 and lysine 23). We also appended the first two amino acids of the prepro-α-factor signal sequence to the hybrid signal peptide, because several constructs used in previous studies had incorporated these (43Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). When DPAPB-PrP254 was expressed in yeast, two major bands of 27 and 35 kDa and a minor band of 33 kDa were observed on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A, lane 2). The two larger bands were shifted to 27 kDa when samples were treated with endo H (Fig. 2B, lane 2), indicating that the protein was glycosylated and had thus presumably entered the secretory pathway. The 33- and 35-kDa species may represent PrP molecules carrying one or two N-linked oligosaccharide chains, respectively. These larger forms are similar in size to core-glycosylated PrP synthesized in cultured cells and in translation reactions in vitro (46Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 47Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We presume that the unglycosylated form of DPAPBPrP254 (27 kDa; Fig. 2A, lane 2) is smaller than unglycosylated PrP-(1-254) (30 kDa; Fig. 2A, lane 6) because of cleavage of the N- and C-terminal signal peptides in the former molecule. We also tried substituting the C-terminal GPI addition signal of PrP with segments of either 32, 43, or 63 amino acids derived from the C terminus of Gas1p, a GPI-anchored yeast protein (48Nuoffer C. Jeno P. Conzelmann A. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991"
https://openalex.org/W2065847024,"A B cell-specific adaptor protein, BASH (also known as BLNK or SLP-65), is crucial for B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. BASH binds to various signaling intermediates, such as Btk, PLCγ2, Vav, and Grb2, through its well defined motifs. Although functional significance of such interactions has been documented, BASH-mediated signal transduction mechanism is not fully understood. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel protein that binds to a conserved N-terminal domain of BASH, which we named BNAS2 (BASH N terminus associated protein 2). From its deduced amino acid sequence, BNAS2 is presumed to contain four transmembrane domains, which are included in a central MARVEL domain, and to localize to endoplasmic reticulum. BNAS2 was co-precipitated with BASH as well as Btk and ERK2 from a lysate of mouse B cell line. In the transfected cells, the exogenous BNAS2 was localized in a mesh-like structure in the cytoplasm resembling that of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear membrane. BASH was co-localized with BNAS2 in a manner dependent on its N-terminal domain. RT-PCR analysis indicated that BNAS2 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously except for plasma cells. In chicken B cell line DT40, overexpression of BNAS2 resulted in an enhancement of BCR ligation-mediated transcriptional activation of Elk1, but not of NF-κB, in a manner dependent on the dose of BNAS2. Thus BNAS2 may serve as a scaffold for signaling proteins such as BASH, Btk, and ERK at the ER and nuclear membrane and may facilitate ERK activation by signaling from cell-surface receptors.

BCR engagement evokes a signal that eventually causes various outcomes of B cells, such as activation, proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis, depending on the developmental stage and circumstances of the cells. Cross-linking of BCR induces phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) of Igα and Igβ. When the ITAM of Igα is phosphorylated, the tyrosine kinase Syk is recruited and activated. The other tyrosine kinases belonging to the Src family (Lyn, Fyn, and Blk), as well as Btk, are also phosphorylated and activated through BCR engagement. These kinases phosphorylate and activate signaling intermediates like phospholipase C (PLC)γ, Vav, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the following signaling cascades such as Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, and those leading to the activation of transcription factors, NF-AT, AP-1, or NF-κB (1Reth M.

Thus BASH plays a pivotal role in pre-BCR/BCR signal transduction that is essential for B cell development, function, and homeostasis. Previously, proteins with four transmembrane domains (tetra-span transmembrane protein) have been identified, including CD9, CD37, CD53, CD63, CD81, CD82, and PETA-3 (22Boucheix C. Benoit P.

For example, CD81 (TAPA-1) forms a complement receptor together with CD21 and CD19 (30Bradbury L.E. Kansas G.S. Levy S. Evans R.L. Tedder T.F. J.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, other tetra-span transmembrane proteins, namely occludin and claudin, localize at tight junction and are involved in cell adhesion (31Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S.

The N-terminal basic domain of BASH is evolutionally conserved and necessary for signaling function. 2D. Kitamura, N. Okamoto, Y. Ebina, and Y. Imamura, unpublished data.2D. Kitamura, N. Okamoto, Y. Ebina, and Y. Imamura, unpublished data. However proteins that interact with the basic domain have not yet been identified. We have set out to clone such proteins by yeast two-hybrid system using chicken BASH N-terminal domain as a bait, and with a cDNA library from chicken B cell DT40. Here we describe the identification of a novel tetra-span transmembrane protein, which we have named BASH N terminus associated protein 2 (BNAS2), and the characterization of this molecule. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Handling of yeast strain L40, screening procedure, and isolation of plasmids were carried out as described in the user manual of Hybrid Hunter (Invitrogen). Complementary DNAs derived from DT40 cells were synthesized with oligo(dT) primers and inserted into EcoRI and XhoI sites of pJG4–5. Titration of this cDNA library indicated that 5.2 × 106 independent clones have been generated. 500 μg of the cDNA library and 10 mg of herring testis DNA (Clontech) as a carrier were introduced into a reporter strain containing a bait plasmid, pHybLex/Zeo-cBASH(1∼62). The transformed yeasts were streaked on agar plates (SD/-H-W-U+Zeocin) and cultured at 30 °C over 1 week. Candidate positive colonies were restreaked on agar plates of the same type for further purification and propagation (second and third screenings). Sequencing of the positive clones was carried out using primers for pJG4–5 (Invitrogen). Plasmid Constructions—pHybLex/Zeo-cBASH(1∼62): A fragment of chicken BASH cDNA encoding amino acids 1∼62 amino acid was amplified by PCR with 100 pmol of forward and reverse primers (5′-GGG AAT TCG GAT CCA TGG ACA AGC TGA ACA AAC-3′ and 5′-GGC TCG AGT CAT GGT TTT TTT TTT AGC CGA TCC-3′, respectively), 1 ng of pCAT7-cBASH as a template and 2.5 units of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Toyobo). The amplified DNA was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and inserted into pHybLex/Zeo (Invitrogen). pGST-cBASH(1∼62): an EcoRI-XhoI fragment from pHybLex/Zeo-cBASH(1∼62) was inserted into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). pCAT7-cBNAS2: a cDNA insert (EcoRI-SalI fragment) from the positive clone (2D11-6) isolated by the yeast two hybrid system was inserted into pCAT7-neo containing the cytomegalovirus enhancer and β-actin promoter (35Morimura T. Goitsuka R. Zhang Y. Saito I. Reth M. Kitamura D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36523-36531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). pCAT7-mB-NAS2: mouse BNAS2 cDNA was amplified by PCR with mouse spleen cDNA as a template and with the following primers: m2D11-6-1 (5′-GGG AAT TCT ATG TGG CCC CCG GAC GCA GAG CCA GAG CCC-3′) and m2D11-6-A (5′-GGG TCG ACT TGA TCA GAG TCT GAG TCC GAG TTG GAG TT-3′). The amplified fragment and pCAT7-neo vector were digested with EcoRI and SalI, mixed, and ligated. pCAFLAG: 100 pmol each of oligonucleotides 5′-DFLAG (5′-CAT GTG CCA CCA TGG ATT ACA AGG ATG ACG ACG ATA AGG ATT ACA AGG ATG ACG ACG ATA AGT C-3′) and 3′-DFLAG (5′-TCG AGA CTT ATC GTC GTC ATC CTT GTA ATC CTT ATC GTC GTC ATC CTT GTA ATC CAT GGT GGC A-3′) were annealed and phosphorylated. The oligonucleotides were inserted into the SpeI and XhoI sites of pCAHAgyr-neo, a derivative of pCAT7-neo, to replace a HAgyr tag with a FLAG tag. pCAF-LAG-mBNAS2: The EcoRI-SalI fragment of mBNAS2 from pCAT7-mBNAS2 was inserted into pCAFLAG vector. pCA-mBNAS2: pCAFLAG-mBNAS2 was digested with SpeI and XhoI, and the termini were blunt-ended and ligated to remove the FLAG tag. pECFP-cBASH: the chicken BASH cDNA (an EcoRI-BamHI fragment) from pCAT7-cBASH was inserted into pECFP-C1 (Clontech). pECFP-cBASHΔ62: An EcoRI-HincII fragment of cBASH was amplified by PCR with 100 pmol of forward and reverse primers (5′-GGG AAT TCA CCT CCA AGT CTA CCA CGA AGG G-3′ and 5′-AGT AGG GAG GGC TGA TTT TGC GGG-3′, respectively), 1 ng of pCAT7-cBASH as a template and 2.5 units of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. The EcoRI-HincII fragment was ligated with a HincII-BamH I fragment of cBASH from pCAT7-cBASH and an EcoRI-BamHI fragment of pUC19 (named pcBASH(E-B)). An EcoRI-SalI fragment from the pcBASH(E-B) was inserted into pECFP-C1. pEYFP-mBNAS2: the mBNAS2 cDNA (an EcoRI and SalI fragment) from pCAT7-mBNAS2 was inserted into pEYFP-C1 (Clontech). pRSV-β-gal: Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-LTR promoter was amplified by PCR with specific primers (5′-CCG CTC GAG TAT CTG CTC CCT GCT TGT-3′ and 5′-CAT GCC ATG GAT CTG GTG CAC ACC AAT GT-3′), and with pOPI3CAT (Stratagene) as a template. The amplified fragment was digested with XhoI and NcoI and then ligated with an XhoI-NcoI fragment from pactβgal (36Yagi T. Shigetani Y. Okado N. Tokunaga T. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3343-3351PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR—Preparation of poly(A)+ RNAs from various cell lines and cDNA synthesis were described previously (37Goitsuka R. Kanzashi H. Sasanuma H. Fujimura Y. Hidaka Y. Tatsuno A. Ra C. Hayashi K. Kitamura D. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cDNAs thus obtained (0.5 μl) were mixed in 50 μl of final reaction volume with 50 pmol of each of the m2D11-6-1 and m2D11-6-A primers, and 0.625 units of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. The primers of β-actin for the internal control were mβ-actin 5′ (5′-TAC AAT GAG CTG CGT GTG GC-3′) and mβ-actin 3′ (5′-ATA GCT CTT CTC CAG GGA GG-3′). PCR conditions were as follows: first denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min annealing at 65 °C, 1 min extension at 72 °C. Finally, 12.5 μl of PCR products were electrophoresed on 3% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The size marker (100-bp ladder, Invitrogen) was also electrophoresed. Cell Culture—DT40 cells were cultured and maintained as described previously (7Ishiai M. Kurosaki M. Pappu R. Okawa K Ronko I. Fu C. Shibata M. Iwamatsu A. Chan A.C. Kurosaki T. Immunity. 1999; 10: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% of fetal bovine serum. Transfections and Luciferase Assay—For co-immunoprecipitation assay, expression vectors, pCAFLAG-mBNAS2, and pAT7-mBASH (1 μg each), were mixed with TransIT-LT1 reagents (Mirus). These mixtures were co-transfected into 2 × 106 COS-7 cells. Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested. For confocal microscopy, 0.5 μg of each vector, pCA-mBNAS2, pECFP-cBASH, pECFP-cBASHΔ62, and/or pEYFP-mBNAS2, was transfected into 2 × 105 COS-7 cells as indicated. For the GST pull-down assay, 25 μg of pCAT7-cBNAS2 were transfected into 2 × 107 BASH-deficient DT40 cells by electroporation. After 1 day, the cells were stimulated, or not, with mouse monoclonal anti-chicken IgM antibody (M4, 1 μg/ml). For the Elk-luciferase assay (Trans-reporting system: Stratagene), 20 μg of empty vector (pCAT7-neo) or various dose of BNAS2 expression vectors (pCAT7-cBNAS2 or pCAT7-mBNAS2), corrected to the total amount of DNA (20 μg) with pCAT7-neo, were mixed with 1 μg of pFA2-Elk1, 10 μg of pFR-Luc, and 1 μg of pRSV-β-gal. The mixtures were transfected into 5 × 106 DT40 cells by electroporation. In the case of the NF-κB-luciferase assay, 20 μg of pCAT7-neo or BNAS2 expression vectors described above were mixed with 10 μg of pkBtk-Luc (38Kashiwada M. Shirakata Y. Inoue J.I. Nakano H. Okazaki K. Okumura K. Yamamoto T. Nagaoka H. Takemori T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and 1 μg of pRSV-β-gal. 24 h after transfection, the cells were stimulated for 6 h with M4 antibody (1 μg/ml), or with a combination of ionomycin (1 μm) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 ng/ml), and lysed. Luciferase activities in the lysates were accessed as described previously (39Katsuta H Tsuji S. Niho Y. Kurosaki T. Kitamura D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1547-1551PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies—Antiserum against mouse BNAS2 protein was produced by immunizing rabbit with a synthetic peptide corresponding to N-terminal residues of mouse BNAS2 (MWPPDAEPEPDPE+C) conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The serum was purified with affinity column carrying the same peptide. Mouse monoclonal anti-T7 tag (Novagen) and anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma-Aldrich), goat anti-GST (Amersham Biosciences), goat anti-Btk (C-20: Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-ERK2 (C-14: Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit anti-MEK1/2 (Cell Signaling) antibodies were purchased, respectively. Rabbit antiserum against BASH was previously described (16Hayashi K. Nittono R. Okamoto N. Tsuji S. Hara Y. Goitsuka R. Kitamura D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2755-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation, GST Pull-down Assay, and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were performed as previously described (11Tsuji S. Okamoto M. Yamada k. Okamoto N. Goitsuka R. Alnold R. Kiefer F. Kitamura D. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For the GST pull-down assay, GST and GST-cBASH(1∼62) proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen) containing pGEX-5X-1 and pGST-cBASH(1∼62), respectively. These proteins were purified with a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) (11Tsuji S. Okamoto M. Yamada k. Okamoto N. Goitsuka R. Alnold R. Kiefer F. Kitamura D. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fifty nanograms of purified proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B again, and cell lysates were added. After washing extensively, the proteins bound to the Sepharose were analyzed by Western blotting. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was carried out using TCS SP2 microscope (Leica). For CFP, excitation and emission wavelengths were 458 nm and 465∼500 nm, respectively. For YFP, the excitation and emission wavelengths were 514 nm and 550∼670 nm, respectively. mB-NAS2 proteins expressed from pCA-mBNAS2 in COS-7 cells were detected with rabbit anti-BNAS2 antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cloning of BASH N Terminus-associated Protein (BNAS) 2 by Yeast Two-hybrid System—Although BASH is known to associate with various signaling proteins through its phosphotyrosine motifs, proline-rich region, and the SH2 domain as described above, proteins binding to a conserved N-terminal domain remain undetermined. Since this domain is crucial for BASH function in BCR signal transduction,2 we sought to identify proteins that bind to this domain. We employed a yeast two-hybrid screening method using the chicken BASH 1∼62 amino acids (basic) domain as a bait. After several rounds of screening, we finally isolated 8 positive clones from 6.5 × 106 colony-forming units of a cDNA library derived from DT40 cells, which represents 5.2 × 106 independent colonies. Binding of these clones was confirmed by back transformation of each into the reporter yeast strain containing the bait construct. We sequenced the inserts of the 8 positive clones and focused on one of them. This clone was about 2.5-kbp long and presumed to contain a full coding sequence by comparison to human/mouse orthologs as described below, and also to chicken EST clones in a data base. We designated the protein deduced from this coding sequence as BNAS2. The primary structure of BNAS2 is shown in Fig. 1A. The chicken BNAS2 protein consists of 169 amino acids and has an estimated molecular mass of 18.6 kDa. The mouse and human orthologs of BNAS2 were identified in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Protein Data Base, which had been tentatively named as cytokine-like factor superfamily (CKLFSF) 3. They were 61.0 and 66.0% homologous to the chicken BNAS2, respectively. BNAS2 appears to have four transmembrane domains, as predicted by SMART analysis (40Schultz J Copley R.R. Doerks T Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). The NCBI Conserved Domain Search predicted that each of them contains MARVEL, a newly described membrane-associating domain, in a large central part. MARVEL domain-containing proteins are often found in lipid-associating proteins, such as occludin and MAL family proteins (41Sanchez-P L. Martin-B F. Valencia A. Alonso M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 599-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The primary protein sequence of BNAS2 shows some similarity to CKLFSF5, another member of the temporal protein family, and weakly to proteolipid protein 2 (also named as A4; Ref. 42Breitwieser G.E. McLenithan J.C. Cortese J.F. Shields J.M. Oliva M.M. Majewski J.L. Machamer C.E. Yang V.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C957-C965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for both of which no function has been suggested (Fig. 1B). Thus, BNAS2 may be a transmembrane protein that associates with other proteins including BASH. Expression Profile of BNAS2—In order to investigate the expression pattern of BNAS2, RT-PCR was carried out using RNA from various hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell lines. As can be seen in Fig. 2, BNAS2 is expressed in T, macrophage, mast, erythroid and non-hematopoietic cell lines. In a B cell lineage, BNAS2 is expressed in pre-B and mature B cell lines, but not in plasma cell lines (J558L and P3U1). This observation suggested that the expression of BNAS2 is essentially ubiquitous but may be down-regulated as B cells terminally differentiate into antibody-secreting cells. Binding of BNAS2 to BASH in Vitro—Binding of BNAS2 and the N-terminal domain of BASH was evident in yeast two-hybrid assay as described above. Here we tested whether full-length BASH is capable of binding to BNAS2. The expression vectors encoding T7-tagged mouse BASH (T7-mBASH) and FLAG-tagged mouse BNAS2 (FLAG-mBNAS2) were co-transfected into COS-7 cells, the T7-mBASH in the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 antibody, and Western blotting was carried out using anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in lane α-T7 of Fig. 3A, BNAS2 was actually co-precipitated with BASH. As a control, irrelevant mouse IgG of the same subclass as the anti-T7 antibody did not precipitate BNAS2 (lane IgG). Conversely, when the FLAG-mBNAS2 was immunoprecipitated, the T7-mBASH was also co-precipitated (Fig. 3B). Therefore full-length BASH protein was shown to bind to BNAS2. To analyze a direct interaction between BASH and BNAS2 proteins, we next carried out a GST pull-down assay. We demonstrate that the GST-cBASH(1∼62) fusion protein, but not the mere GST protein, could precipitate T7-cBNAS2, which was expressed in BASH-deficient DT40 cells regardless of BCR cross-linking (Fig. 3C), indicating that BASH (and more specifically the 1∼62 domain) and BNAS2 directly bind to each other. We next examined a binding of endogenously expressed BNAS2 and BASH proteins by immunoprecipitation assay. Lysate from a mouse B cell line, BAL17, was mixed with anti-BNAS2 antibody, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3D, BASH was co-precipitated with BNAS2, although the expression level of both proteins was rather low in this cell line. In addition, we found that Btk and ERK, but not MEK, were also co-precipitated with BNAS2 reproducibly. Therefore, it was revealed that BNAS2 binds not only to BASH but also some other signaling molecules, such as Btk and ERK. Co-localization of BASH and BNAS2 in a Cell—To examine the localization of BNAS2 in a cell; expression vector encoding mouse BNAS2 was transfected into COS-7 cells. Then the cells were fixed and stained with antibody against BNAS2, then analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4). mBNAS2 located in cytoplasm unevenly: it was localized in a mesh network-like compartment reminiscent of ER morphology, with brightest staining in the perinuclear region. In some instances, strong accumulation of mBNAS2 at a distinctive juxtanuclear compartment was observed. To examine the localization of BNAS2 and BASH in living cells, the expression vectors encoding fluorescent proteinfused BNAS2 (pEYFP-mBNAS2) and BASH (pECFP-cBASH), respectively, were transfected into COS-7 cells, and the cells were inspected by confocal microscopy. As can be seen in Fig. 5A, CFP-cBASH located diffusely in the cytoplasm, with gradual concentration from the periphery toward the nuclei. CFP-cBASHΔ62, in which a BNAS2-bi"
https://openalex.org/W2085797715,"The cleavage of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase leaves the C-terminal fragment of APP, C99, anchored in the plasma membrane. C99 is subsequently processed by γ-secretase, an unusual aspartyl protease activity largely dependent on presenilin (PS), generating the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) that accumulates in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. It has been suggested that PS proteins are the catalytic core of this proteolytic activity, but a number of other proteins mandatory for γ-secretase cleavage have also been discovered. The exact role of PS in the γ-secretase activity remains a matter of debate, because cells devoid of PS still produce some forms of Aβ. Here, we used insect cells expressing C99 to demonstrate that the expression of presenilin 1 (PS1), which binds C99, not only increases the production of Aβ by these cells but also increases the intracellular levels of C99 to the same extent. Using pulse-chase experiments, we established that this results from an increased half-life of C99 in cells expressing PS1. In Chinese hamster ovary cells producing C99 from full-length human APP, similar results were observed. Finally, we show that a functional inhibitor of γ-secretase does not alter the ability of PS1 to increase the intracellular levels of C99. This finding suggests that the binding of PS1 to C99 does not necessarily lead to its immediate cleavage by γ-secretase, which could be a spatio-temporally regulated or an induced event, and provides biochemical evidence for the existence of a substrate-docking site on PS1.

This finding suggests that the binding of PS1 to C99 does not necessarily lead to its immediate cleavage by γ-secretase, which could be a spatio-temporally regulated or an induced event, and provides biochemical evidence for the existence of a substrate-docking site on PS1.

These short 39–42-amino acid peptides result from the sequential cleavage of their precursor, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), by β- and γ-secretase activities. When the β-secretase activity is performed by a well characterized aspartyl protease, β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE 1) (1Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P.

Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar), the γ-secretase activity has been shown to require the interaction of at least four proteins, namely presenilin (PS), nicastrin (NCT), Pen-2 (presenilin enhancer 2), and Aph-1 (anterior pharynx defective 1) (2Yu G.

The mutations of the presenilin 1 and 2 genes are the major cause of familial Alzheimer's disease, and these proteins were, for a long time, the only candidates for γ-secretase activity. As this last cleavage of APP releases a possible causal agent of Alzheimer's disease, it constitutes a prime target for therapeutic intervention, and studies on the potential proteolytic activity of PS have accumulated over the years. Despite a number of convincing demonstrations, these experiments left a number of unresolved issues, the most striking example of which being the ability of cells lacking PS to still produce intracellular Aβ1–42 (4Wilson C.A. Doms R.W. Zheng H. Lee V.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 36Armogida M. Petit A. Vincent B. Scarzello S. da Costa C.A. Checler F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1030-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The assembly of the γ-secretase complex would first involve the binding of Aph-1 to NCT (5LaVoie M.J. Fraering P.C. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Kimberly W.T. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37213-37222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This first complex, in turn, binds to full-length PS and recruits Pen-2, inducing the cleavage of PS into what is believed to be its active, heterodimeric form (6Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M. Takahashi Y. Thinakaran G. Iwatsubo T. Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The whole complex is then translocated to the Golgi apparatus where NCT is glycosylated, a post-translational modification that could be required for γ-secretase activity (7Arawaka S. Hasegawa H. Tandon A. Janus C. Chen F. Yu G. Kikuchi K. Koyama S. Kato T. Fraser P.E. George-Hyslop P. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1065-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Herreman A. Van Gassen G. Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Craessaerts K. Mueller U. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the exact relation between the assembly of this complex and the production of Aβ is still not clear, because the coexpression of all of these partners in cellular models leads to a 10-fold increase of the levels of heterodimeric PS and to the degradation of the substrates of γ-secretase without affecting the secretion of Aβ (9Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Yu C. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33992-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover, because PS1 is known to influence the trafficking of a number of proteins, it has recently been shown to also regulate the trafficking of APP from the trans-Golgi network and the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that it might indirectly regulate the cleavage of APP by controlling its trafficking toward cellular compartments where the γ-secretase activity is located (10Cai D. Leem J.Y. Greenfield J.P. Wang P. Kim B.S. Wang R. Lopes K.O. Kim S.H. Zheng H. Greengard P. Sisodia S.S. Thinakaran G. Xu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3446-3454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Finally, the endogenous γ-secretase activity observed in most cell types complicates the investigation of the subtle changes that transgenes could trigger. Even in yeast, a model lacking γ-secretase activity in which the coexpression of the four aforementioned proteins allowed the production of Aβ (11Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), it obviously cannot be excluded that other essential endogenous proteins are present in these cells and are the still undiscovered partners of this activity. To clarify the role of PS1 in the γ-secretase activity, we used Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells, which are deficient in the amyloidogenic pathway and, like in yeast, have no described orthologue of PS. Here we show that Sf9 cells expressing either human APP and BACE 1 or C99, the major substrate of γ-secretase, secrete low levels of Aβ1–40. Examining the effect of the expression of human PS1 in C99 clones, we measured a 2-fold increase in both the production of Aβ and the intracellular levels of C99, which leaves the Aβ/C99 ratio virtually unchanged. This led us to hypothesize that, in our model, PS1 could function as a chaperone protein protecting C99 from degradation. We therefore performed pulse-chase experiments and demonstrated that the half-life of C99 doubles in the presence of PS1. Furthermore, we confirmed these results in CHO cells expressing human APP, where C99 is physiologically produced by endogenous β-secretase. Finally, we show that a functional inhibitor of γ-secretase activity, DAPT, inhibits the secretion of Aβ but does not impede the ability of PS1 to increase the intracellular steady states of C99. Taken together, these results show that PS1, independently of its direct involvement in γ-secretase activity, is able to protect C99 from degradation and thus increase its availability for γ-secretase, supporting the idea that the influence of PS1 on γ-secretase activity could also be indirect.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The pIZ/V5-His and pIB/V5-His plasmids, Insectin-Plus™, Zeocin™, blasticidin, fetal calf serum, cell culture media, and NuPage™ 4–12% bis-Tris gels were purchased from Invitrogen.

Twenty-five microliters of the sample were then loaded onto NuPage™ 4–12% bis-Tris gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were then saturated in 5% skim milk in 0.05% Tween 20/PBS for 30 min, washed, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody diluted in 0.05% Tween 20/PBS at the following concentrations: 0.5 μg/ml for the WO2 antibody; 1 μg/ml for the anti-BACE 1 antibody; 0.4 μg/ml for the MAB 1563 antibody; 1:2,000 for the APPC-ter antibody; and 1:10,000 for the P7854 antibody. The membrane was then washed and incubated at room temperature for 60 min with 1:10,000 of the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. After washing, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. Where appropriate, bands were quantified using a Gel Doc 2000 (Bio-Rad), and statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance and the Wilcoxon signed ranks test.ELISA—One million cells were plated per well of a 6-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, the medium was replaced by 1 ml of fresh medium. After each time point, the culture medium was collected, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and l μg/ml pepstatin) were added. Selective quantification of Aβ1–40 was performed on 100 μl of these samples by fluorescent sandwich ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Biosource).Pulse-Chase—3 × 105 Sf9 cells or 1.5 × 105 CHO cells were plated in each well of a 12-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, the medium was removed, the cells were washed three times with PBS, and methionine-free Grace medium was added for 1 h. The medium was then replaced by 400 μl/well methionine-free Grace medium supplemented with [35S]methionine (250μCi/ml). One hour later, the medium was removed, cells were washed three times with PBS, and the cells were chased with Grace medium containing methionine for 0, 1, 2, and 3 h. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated for 5 min with 500 μl/well lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, pH7.5, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm methionine) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and l μg/ml pepstatin). The lysates were then homogenized through a 0.3-mm needle 20 times and centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 3 min. The remaining pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of fresh buffer, homogenized, and centrifuged again. The supernatants were then pooled with the former ones, centrifuged for 10 min, and 50 μl of supernatant was retained for protein assay using the BCA protein kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of proteins for each condition were then immunoprecipitated.Immunoprecipitations—The samples were pre-cleared overnight at 4 °C by incubation with 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose and 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation (15, 800 × g for 3 min), supernatants were pre-cleared again with fresh protein A and bovine serum albumin for 30 min. After the removal of protein A-Sepharose by further centrifugation, the samples were immunoprecipitated with 1.5 μg of the WO2 antibody for 60 min at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (5 mg) and 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were then added for 1 h. The samples were then centrifuged for 3 min, and the pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with lysis buffer supplemented with 0.1% SDS, and finally with lysis buffer alone. The pellets were incubated for 10 min at 96 °C in a buffer containing 10% dithiothreitol and 20% of NuPage™ LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). The samples were then centrifuged for 3 min, and the supernatants were loaded onto Tris-glycine 16.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried for autoradiography. The bands were then visualized and quantified using a Cyclone™ storage phosphor system (Packard Instrument Co.).RESULTSMetabolism of APP in Sf9 Cells Coexpressing Human APP and BACE 1—As demonstrated previously (12Pitsi D. Kienlen-Campard P. Octave J.N. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), expression of human APP in Sf9 cells leads to the production of the α-secretase cleavage product C83 (Fig. 1, lane 1) but not to the production of the β-secretase cleavage product C99 (Fig. 1, lane 2). This lack of β-secretase activity could explain the inability of these cells to generate Aβ from human APP695 without excluding the possibility that they could also show impaired γ-secretase activity. To establish the amyloidogenic pathway in Sf9 cells, we first transfected the cDNA encoding the human β-secretase, BACE 1, in clones producing APP. This resulted in the production of the immature and mature glycosylated forms of BACE 1 (Fig. 1, lane 4) and induced the production of the expected cleavage product of APP, C99 (Fig. 1, lane 3). In previous experiments, we tried to immunoprecipitate Aβ in the culture medium of Sf9 cells expressing APP and BACE 1. Compared with rat neurons infected with an adenovirus encoding human APP, which clearly produce amyloid peptide, it was clear that the production of Aβ by Sf9 cells was either nonexistent or largely below what is observed in neurons, dropping below our detection limit. Using a much more sensitive ELISA, however, we detected low levels of Aβ1–40 (327 ± 67 pg/ml; n = 3) in the medium of cells expressing APP and BACE 1. As expected, cells expressing APP alone did not produce detectable amounts of Aβ. All assays were performed after 12 h of incubation, in accordance with our previous work in neurons.Influence of PS1 on the Catabolism of C99, the Substrate of γ-Secretase—Presenilin 1, mutations of which are known to be the cause of most hereditary forms of Alzheimer's disease, has been demonstrated to be tightly implicated in γ-secretase activity, although its exact function in the γ-secretase complex is unclear. Recent evidence showed that although presenilins bind to the substrates of γ-secretase (12Pitsi D. Kienlen-Campard P. Octave J.N. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 15Xia W. Ray W.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Rahmati T. Kimberly W.T. Wolfe M.S. Zhang J. Goate A.M. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Scarzello S. da Costa C.A. Checler F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1030-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because of the poor characterization of the Sf9 genome so far, it is not known whether these cells contain some PS orthologues, and we wanted to examine whether expression of human PS1 could modulate the production of Aβ in Sf9 cells. Transfection of the PS1 cDNA in clones expressing APP and BACE1 was hampered by the unavailability of an expression plasmid for Sf9 cells encoding an additional antibiotic resistance gene. Moreover, transiently transfected cells only produced low levels of the protein (not shown). Also, we had noticed previously that infection of Sf9 cells by recombinant baculoviruses leads to artifacts as well as to rapid and massive cell death (12Pitsi D. Kienlen-Campard P. Octave J.N. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to express PS1 in Sf9 cells expressing C99 fused to the signal sequence of human APP, a protein that does not need to be cleaved by BACE1 to become a substrate of γ-secretase. Clones expressing C99 produced large amounts of the protein (Fig. 2, lane 1). When the same C99 clone was transfected with the plasmid encoding human PS1 (Fig. 2, lane 2), we observed a normal endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 (Fig. 2, lane 3) leading to the formation of the active, heterodimeric form of PS1 (17Thinakaran G.

Monitoring the production of Aβ1–40 in the culture medium of C99 cells by ELISA, we again observed a low production of Aβ (116 ± 16 pg/ml; n = 5) after 12 h. Interestingly, cells coexpressing C99 and PS1 produced nearly twice (311 ± 18 pg/ml; n = 5) the quantity of Aβ observed in their counterparts devoid of presenilin.Fig. 2Influence of PS1 on the expression and processing of C99 in Sf9 cells. Western blot analysis, using the α-APPC-ter antibody, of the metabolism of C99 in cells expressing C99 alone (lane 1) or C99 and human PS1 (C99+PS1) (lane 2).

These experiments showed that the production of Aβ was maximal after 12 h and that the kinetics of production of Aβ are similar, whether or not PS1 is expressed in the C99 clone. The experiments also confirmed that cells co-expressing C99 and PS1 produce significantly more Aβ than cells expressing C99 alone (Fig. 3B). This finding suggests that γ-secretase activity is increased in cells producing human PS1. Careful analysis of the metabolism of C99 in these cells revealed that this was not the case. On the contrary, cells expressing PS1 produced more than twice the amount of C99 observed in cells expressing C99 alone (Fig 3C). Therefore, the expression of human PS1 in Sf9 cells does not seem to modify their Aβ/C99 ratio or, thus, their γ-secretase activity. It does, however, reproducibly increase the levels of C99 in the cells (n = 5).Fig. 3Kinetics of Aβ1–40 production and quantification of intracellular C99 production.

This would increase the steady state of C99 in cells and, hence, its availability for the γ-secretase activity. To assess this possibility, we performed pulsechase experiments. Labeling the newly synthesized proteins with [35S]methionine for an hour before chasing with cold methionine indeed indicated that the amounts of C99 recovered after 3 h of chase were approximately doubled upon the coexpression of PS1 (Fig. 4, A and B).Fig. 4Influence of PS1 on the turnover of C99. A, typical pulsechase of C99 in Sf9 cells shows the time-dependent decay of C99 in a clone expressing C99 alone (upper lane) and in the same clone also expressing PS1 (lower lane). B, quantification of the pulse-chase experiments on C99 and C99 plus PS1 (C99+PS1) cells, expressed as percentages of the respective initial (T0) levels, shows that PS1 slows down the decay of C99 (mean of two independent experiments).

Kienlen-Campard P. Octave J.N. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), its subcellular localization is probably partially different. C99 is directly present in the endoplasmic reticulum and travels through the secretory pathway, whereas the cleavage of APP by BACE1 is relatively weak in the endoplasmic reticulum and maximal in the trans-Golgi network (18Hartmann T. Bieger S.C. Bruhl B. Tienari P.J. Ida N. Allsop D. Roberts G.W. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G. Unsicker K. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 9: 1016-1020Crossref Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 19Cook D.G.

We therefore decided to confirm our results in a model containing endogenous β-secretase activity and to study the influence of PS1 on the production of C99 from full-length APP. As it was not possible to obtain stable triply transfected Sf9 cells expressing APP, BACE1, and PS1, we analyzed CHO cells that express an endogenous orthologue of BACE1 and in which the stable expression of human APP alone or together with human PS1 has been established (13Octave J.N. Essalmani R. Tasiaux B. Menager J. Czech C. Mercken L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1525-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Comparing the amounts of C99 produced in the clone expressing APP alone with the amounts of C99 produced after transfecting the same clone with the PS1 cDNA, we found a 2-fold increase in C99 in the presence of PS1 (n = 4), similar to what we had observed in Sf9 cells expressing C99 (Fig. 5, A and B). The amounts of C89, the product of the alternative cleavage by BACE1 that is also a substrate for the γ-secretase activity, were also increased in the presence of PS1. Moreover, this effect of PS1 on the steady-state of C99 was not due to overexpression artifacts, because the total levels of the endoproteolytic fragments of PS1 were not increased in cells expressing human PS1, whereas levels of the full-length protein, which is unlikely to be involved in the secretion of Aβ, were only modestly elevated (Fig. 5A, right panel). Cells expressing human APP alone produced 3,624 ± 290 pg of extracellular Aβ1–40 per milliliter (n = 7), whereas cells expressing both APP and PS1 produced 5567 ± 722 pg of extracellular Aβ1–40 per milliliter (n = 9) (Fig. 5B). Because these results were similar to those observed in Sf9 cells, pulse-chase experiments were undertaken to measure the decay of C99 produced from APP by CHO cells. Similar to what was observed in Sf9 cells, the presence of PS1 slowed down the decay of C99, approximately doubling the amounts of C99 retrieved after 3 h of chase (Fig. 5C). The decay of full-length APP was not significantly modified by the expression of PS1 (not shown).Fig. 5Influence of PS1 on the expression and processing of the C99 produced from human APP in CHO cells.

Recently, similar propagating signals have been observed in ocean color (6, 7). Here, too, the mechanisms remain unclear; nutrient pumping into the photic layer, followed by uptake by phytoplankton, has been suggested (8), as has lateral advection by the propagating RWs (7).

The key is to study images of galaxies at highly redshifted wavelengths, representing galaxy formation at the earliest time in the history of the universe. Aiding the search for answers are several new imaging and spectroscopic surveys that may reveal how massive galaxies form and grow."
