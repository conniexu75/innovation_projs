https://openalex.org/W1984521259,Contractions of glycerinated skeletal (striated) and vascular (smooth) muscles are similar in their calcium dependence but differ in their magnesium dependence. The threshold concentration of free Ca(++) for contraction of either muscle was 1.8 x 10(-7)M; maximum tension developed when the concentration of free Ca(++) was slightly greater than 10(-6)M. The Mg concentration required for contraction of smooth muscle was at least ten times as great as that for skeletal muscle.

https://openalex.org/W2051579314,"Cortical evoked responses to flashes and clicks were recorded from human subjects performing visual or auditory tasks under three conditions of selective attentiveness. The subjects were required to attend to the flashes and to ignore alternating clicks, or vice versa. Responses to flashes recorded from the occipital area were larger when attention was directed toward visual stimuli, and responses to click stimuli recorded from the temporal area were larger when attention was directed toward auditory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2005573284,"Technical improvements in the method for vertical acrylamide gel electrophoresis (Raymond) have resulted in improved resolution and reproducibility. In a survey of approximately 200 normal human serums, ten lines were found to be common in all specimens. Interposed with these constant lines and in addition to known variations in the pattern reflecting haptoglobin and transferrin types, at least one line followed that of albumin and three followed that of transferrin; the presence or absence of these varied from individual to individual. Based on these variations, the electrophoretic patterns of normal humans may be divided into at least 12 discrete groups."
https://openalex.org/W1995752248,"The rate of release of gamma-aminobutyric acid from the perforated pial surface of the cerebral cortex in the cat showed systematic variations with the state of activation or ""arousal"" of the electrocorticogram. In animals subjected to midbrain coagulation and showing constant spindle patterns characteristic of sleep, the rate of release was three times greater (about 2 micrograms per hour per square centimeter) than in animals showing a largely ""aroused"" electrocorticogram, which had sections of the upper cervical cord or were neuraxially intact but had been given local anesthesia. The rate of release of glutamic acid was lower in the ""sleeping"" animals than in ""aroused"" animals, while no such differences were found for glutamine and aspartic acid. Such studies may lead to a better understanding of chemical mechanisms involved in the control of states of consciousness by the brain stem."
https://openalex.org/W1971760578,The endoderm can be separated from the ectomesoderm of the area vasculosa of the early chick embryo. The development of the separated germ layers in organ cultures shows that the endoderm is necessary for the normal formation of blood islands by mesodermal cells. In the absence of endoderm the mesodermal cells undergo erythropoiesis in dispersed groups of cells but do not form endothelium.
https://openalex.org/W2003074504,"Infectious DNA from the tumor-inducing polyoma virus and pneumococcal-transforming DNA can be recovered from the blood of mice in biologically active form after intraperitoneal injection. Polyoma DNA appeared to undergo less inactivation than did transforming DNA. In light of these observations, the metastatic spread of cancer may possibly be favored by circulation of tumorigenic DNA in the blood stream."
https://openalex.org/W2095257326,Four dipeptides and a tripeptide were formed when an aqueous solution of glycine and leucine was exposed to ultraviolet light in the presence of cyanamide.
https://openalex.org/W2013061367,"Pigeons, with one eye open, were reinforced for pecking at a 45 degrees oblique line (/). When the opposite, untrained, eye alone was open, pigeons responded maximally to the mirror-image (135 degrees [unknown]) of the training stimulus (45 degrees [unknown]). This unexpected interocular reversal of mirror-image stimuli has not been reported for any other species."
https://openalex.org/W1991704329,"Complement-fixing antigens specific for rubella were made in tissue cultures of RK-13 rabbit kidney cells and primary cultures of kidney from the African green monkey. The antigens were prepared with the infected cell monolayer diluted to 30 percent with supernatant fluid and frozen and thawed three times. Complement-fixing antibody appeared in patients with rubella soon after the termination of rash and persisted for at least 8 months. In 8 out of 12 individuals who had the disease 10 to 20 years before they were tested, no complement-fixing antibody was found, but neutralizing antibody was present."
https://openalex.org/W2041719124,Dicyandiamide promotes certain dehydration condensations under conditions possible on primitive Earth. The effect of this compound in promoting peptide syntheses was studied.
https://openalex.org/W2039972656,"Rats with bilateral lesions in the medial forebrain bundle demonstrate both an increased sensitivity to electric shock, as reflected by a lowered jump threshold, and a decrease in the concentration of serotonin in the brain. Both effects of the lesion are characterized by a delayed time of onset and gradual development, which approximates the time required for progressive nerve degeneration in the central nervous system. It is suggested that this behavioral effect of bilateral lesions in the medial forebrain bundle may be due to a central denervation supersensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1985888583,Recordings from chick and duck fetuses inside the egg revealed an increase in the rate of bill-clapping and vocalization when the fetuses were aurally stimulated by the maternal call of their species on the day before hatching.
https://openalex.org/W1984381140,"Objective improvement after therapy with melphalan occurred in all patients producing only Bence Jones kappa proteins, in half of the patients with myeloma serum proteins, and in none of those producing only Bence Jones lambda proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2132500761,"The chromosome number of the domestic horse is 2 n = 64; different races have the same complement. The chromosomes of two Przewalski's horses (at Catskill Game Farm, New York), presumably ancestral wild horses from Mongolia, are identical: 2 n = 66, with more acrocentric and fewer metacentric elements than the chromosomes of the domestic horse. This apparent difference in karyotype may help resolve the questions of ""purity"" in the relatively few remaining Przewalski's horses. Moreover, these findings are of interest in relation to the apparent fertility of hybrids between these species."
https://openalex.org/W2050789698,"The substance responsible for the poisoning effect of ciguatera poison from fish is an anticholinesterase. In rats, mice, and rabbits ciguatera poison causes death by asphyxiation. Protopam chloride with atropine is an effective antidote."
https://openalex.org/W1981847182,"In dogs subjected to hemorrhagic shock, a marked decrease in the noradrenaline content of the sympathetic nerve terminals in the normally innervated spleen is revealed by means of a histochemical fluorescence method. Deprivation of the sympathetic impulse-flow to the tissue immediately before the animals are subjected to shock prevents this depletion. The results support the hypothesis that the vasoconstriction which occurs during shock is due to the effect of noradrenaline released locally in the tissues, and not to circulating noradrenaline."
https://openalex.org/W2023496375,"Changes in electroencephalograms indicate that subjects respond more frequently to significant or meaningful stimuli during sleep than to nonsignificant stimuli, and that conditioned reactions may be induced in sleeping subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2026771124,The variations in the membrane potentials of skeletal muscle fibers which follow high rates of sodium extrusion are not due to changes in the ionic concentrations of the fiber; experiments suggest that sodium is extruded by an electrogenic mechanism.
https://openalex.org/W2038216465,"The capacity to conserve urinary water by producing a concentrated urine is directly related to the number of Henle's loops in the kidneys of three terrestrial birds. This suggests that a Henle's loop countercurrent multiplier is responsible for urine concentration in these birds. Several features of the organization of the kidneys of these birds may account for the importance of multiplier number, as contrasted to multiplier length in mammals, in determining maximum urine concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2016899508,The onset and magnitude of the sweating response is greatly influenced by the local skin temperature. This influence was evident with skin temperatures above 33 degrees C and occurred in the physiological range for thermo-regulatory sweating. The sweating rates were recorded continuously and simultaneously from three areas of the skin.
https://openalex.org/W2033204498,"Administration of penicillamine reduced the concentration of cystine in the plasma and urine of patients with cystinuria; renal clearance of cystine, lysine, and arginine remained unchanged. Cysteine-penicillamine disulfide and penicillamine disulfide were detected in the plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1976424484,"Sea urchin eggs, exposed to a radioactive amino acid during the period from fertilization to metaphase of the first cleavage, incorporate the label into proteins. Some radioactivity is localized in the region of the mitotic apparatus (MA). The specific activity of proteins from isolated mitotic apparatus is more than three times that of the proteins from the rest of the cell, although under the conditions used for isolation only 11 percent of the total incorporated label is in the MA. The radio-activity is found in proteins that do not contribute significantly to the bulk of the MA protein, but this description might possibly apply to the fibrous skeleton. Electron microscope autoradiograms reveal a close association of radioactivity with the fibers."

https://openalex.org/W1972401998,"When DNA is irradiated by ultraviolet light a paramagnetic damage center is formed in the thymine bases. The structure of this free radical has been determined by electron spin resonance and consists of a hydrogen addition at the carbon No. 6 position. The rate of formation of the radical is enhanced by water vapor, and it is quenched by paramagnetic ions bound to the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2059838256,"Certain ganglion cells from the central region of dark-adapted retina of the rhesus monkey respond to stimulation of both rod and cone receptors. With dim stimuli the function of these ganglion cells is determined entirely by the rods; with brighter stimuli that affect both dark-adapted rods and cones, little evidence of rod function is detectable because a cone mechanism appears to determine both the latency and frequency of ganglion-cell firing."
https://openalex.org/W2032439201,Two captive sea lions (Zalophus californianus) presented with a series of size-discrimination tasks showed preferences for the smaller of two targets and gave virtually errorless performances despite changes in the form and relative size of the targets. Further tests revealed that they were capable of discriminating a size-difference ratio as small as 1.06:1.
https://openalex.org/W2085580998,"Plaque-forming cells elaborating antibody specific for Salmonella enteritidis somatic antigen have been demonstrated in the thymus of rabbits 5 days after a single systemic injection of a minute amount of this bacterial polysaccharide. A marked decrease in organ weight and loss of thymic cellularity was also seen, and was most pronounced at the time when antibody-forming cells made their appearance."
https://openalex.org/W2009107724,"Various tissues of the brook trout contain as many as nine forms of lactate dehydrogenase, an indication that at least three polypeptide subunits synthesized under the control of three nonallelic genes take part in the lactate dehydrogenase composition of this species. There was no evidence of a spermatozoan-specific lactate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W2024991530,"In the cat with intact sinoaortic reflexes, episodes of deep sleep are accompanied by marked falls in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The falls are much larger after bilateral sino-aortic deafferentation: to such low pressures during deep sleep that episodes of transient cerebral ischemia (electroencephalographic flattening and seizures) sometimes occur."
https://openalex.org/W2075145148,A yeast mutant independently isolated as a glutamate auxotroph (glt(2-1)) was similar to the glt(1-1) mutant in exhibiting a blocked tricarboxylic acid cycle due to the lack of aconitate hydratase. The new mutant differed by exhibiting blocks in lysine and cytochrome biosynthesis which segregated together with the glutamate requirement.
https://openalex.org/W2094614559,"A substance that rapidly lyses living cells of Staphylococcus aureus, S. roseus, Gaffkya tetragena, and Sarcina lutea has been partially purified. The substance is produced extracellularly by a species of Pseudomonas which was isolated from soil by an enrichment procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2013465551,"Giant salamanders, Amphiuma means, measuring 240 to 280 millimeters from snout to vent, tolerate induced anoxia for 6 hours. After 3 hours of anoxia, hepatic glycogen units are reduced in size and concentration; after 6 hours the glycogen units are almost completely depleted. Greater development and changes in the density of the endoplasmic reticulum indicate that this structure participates in the mobilization of glycogen from the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1994594836,"Apparently the leucine and tryptophan gene clusters are polarized in opposite directions on the Salmonella chromosome. Either the direction of polarity is independently determined for each operon or the bacterial chromosome may consist of more than one multi-operon unit of DNA, each such unit determining the direction of polarity of its constituent genes. Each hypothesis results in a different prediction concerning the distribution of operon polarity directions on the chromosome and the functional status of chromosomal inversions."
https://openalex.org/W1995827243,"Two strains of the true slime mold Didymium nigripes form distinctive plaques when their spores are plated clonally. Strain C6 gives rise to plaques surrounded by large plasmodia. Plaques of strain A20 at first contain only amoebas, the formation of plasmodia being delayed; and strain A20 is resistant to cycloheximide. Plasmodia of C6 and A20 were fused, and at intervals the fused plasmodia were cut into segments and each segment was permitted to fruit. The resulting spores were plated clonally and the plaques scored as C6-type or A20-type. When equal-sized C6 and A20 plasmodia were fused, the A20 characteristic of delayed plasmodium formation disappeared with time so that after 8 hours few A20 plaques could be recovered even from the A20 side of the fused plasmodium. When the ratio between sizes of C6 and A20 plasmodia to be fused was varied, similar results were obtained. The A20 characteristic did not disappear until fruiting."
https://openalex.org/W2081470249,"Incubation of Escherichia coli 15T- in the presence of puromycin inhibits the inducible formation of β-galactosidase to a greater extent than it inhibits protein synthesis. In E. coli 33.00 β-galactosidase formation is also more sensitive to the presence of puromycin than is protein synthesis. In the presence of glycerol (but not in its absence) puromycin prevents the production of messenger RNA for β-galactosidase, presumably as a result of catabolite repression."
https://openalex.org/W2014260840,In cockerels a single injection of estrogen causes a rise of several fold in the plasma iron. At 18 hours this response is proportional to the amount of diethylstilbestrol injected and may be used as a convenient measure of estrogen action. The phenomenon is probably related to the estrogen-induced synthesis of iron-binding phosphoproteins.
https://openalex.org/W1987198840,"RNA similar in base composition to viral DNA is formed in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells infected with vaccinia virus. This RNA is found both in polyribosomes and in a broad 30S to 74S region in a sucrose density gradient. When infected cells are exposed to actinomycin, the amount of this DNA-like RNA in the 30S to 74S region is unchanged. Under the same conditions, 70 percent of the polyribosome-associated DNA-like RNA is degraded to acidsoluble fragments within 2 hours, and protein synthesis is reduced by 90 percent."
https://openalex.org/W1979491648,"Electrodes and cannulea can be permanently implanted in the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus. Recordings of electrical activity can be obtained from the optic nerve, heart, and abdominal ganglia and the cannulae are effective routes for introducing isotopes into the nervous system. The animals survive for at least 13 days and are not behaviorally impaired."
https://openalex.org/W1993620429,The selectivity of glass electrodes suitable for potassium-ion measurements depends on the age of electrodes and the composition of the solution. An empirical equation describing the electrode potential as a function of solution composition is given for practical application in solutions containing both sodium and potassium.
https://openalex.org/W1994558956,"Treating cultures of Agrobacterium tumefaciens at 39 degrees to 48 degrees C reduces the infectivity of the bacteria without necessarily affecting viability. Destruction of the capacity to initiate tumor growth follows first-order kinetics from which rate constants for thermal inactivation are derived. From these rates, values for heat of activation of 56.7 kcal mole(-1) and entropy of activation of 107 cal mole(-1) deg(-1) are obtained. A particular protein or nucleoprotein active in the process of infection may be inactivated by the treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1974453385,"Hypothermia was induced by hypercapnic hypoxia in thirteen-lined ground squirrels, Citellus tridecemlineatus. When the squirrels were allowed to recover normal body temperatures at a 10°C ambient temperature, those with anterior hypothalamicpreoptic lesions took three to four times longer than normal controls to reach a body temperature of 35°C."
https://openalex.org/W2040950072,"Isolated L-chains with either the A4 or the A5 allotypic markers from rabbit antibodies to 2,4-dinitrophenyl determinant recombine at random with antibody H-chains in the presence or absence of the hapten to produce hybrid precipitating antibody molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2048581082,"During the activation of prothrombin at least two peptides are split off the molecule. These peptides become attached to thrombin, changing its proteolytic activity. Depending on the peptide adsorbed the endopeptidase activity of thrombin increases or diminishes. Acidification of thrombin by acetylation of amino groups uncovers the influence of peptides on the properties of thrombin."
