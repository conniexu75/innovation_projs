https://openalex.org/W2891678928,"Bone consists of separate inner endosteal and outer periosteal compartments, each with distinct contributions to bone physiology and each maintaining separate pools of cells owing to physical separation by the bone cortex. The skeletal stem cell that gives rise to endosteal osteoblasts has been extensively studied; however, the identity of periosteal stem cells remains unclear1–5. Here we identify a periosteal stem cell (PSC) that is present in the long bones and calvarium of mice, displays clonal multipotency and self-renewal, and sits at the apex of a differentiation hierarchy. Single-cell and bulk transcriptional profiling show that PSCs display transcriptional signatures that are distinct from those of other skeletal stem cells and mature mesenchymal cells. Whereas other skeletal stem cells form bone via an initial cartilage template using the endochondral pathway4, PSCs form bone via a direct intramembranous route, providing a cellular basis for the divergence between intramembranous versus endochondral developmental pathways. However, there is plasticity in this division, as PSCs acquire endochondral bone formation capacity in response to injury. Genetic blockade of the ability of PSCs to give rise to bone-forming osteoblasts results in selective impairments in cortical bone architecture and defects in fracture healing. A cell analogous to mouse PSCs is present in the human periosteum, raising the possibility that PSCs are attractive targets for drug and cellular therapy for skeletal disorders. The identification of PSCs provides evidence that bone contains multiple pools of stem cells, each with distinct physiologic functions. A periosteal stem cell specialized in intramembranous bone formation has been identified and was found to be essential for normal bone development and fracture healing."

https://openalex.org/W2951091094,"Nucleosomes cover most of the genome and are thought to be displaced by transcription factors in regions that direct gene expression. However, the modes of interaction between transcription factors and nucleosomal DNA remain largely unknown. Here we systematically explore interactions between the nucleosome and 220 transcription factors representing diverse structural families. Consistent with earlier observations, we find that the majority of the studied transcription factors have less access to nucleosomal DNA than to free DNA. The motifs recovered from transcription factors bound to nucleosomal and free DNA are generally similar. However, steric hindrance and scaffolding by the nucleosome result in specific positioning and orientation of the motifs. Many transcription factors preferentially bind close to the end of nucleosomal DNA, or to periodic positions on the solvent-exposed side of the DNA. In addition, several transcription factors usually bind to nucleosomal DNA in a particular orientation. Some transcription factors specifically interact with DNA located at the dyad position at which only one DNA gyre is wound, whereas other transcription factors prefer sites spanning two DNA gyres and bind specifically to each of them. Our work reveals notable differences in the binding of transcription factors to free and nucleosomal DNA, and uncovers a diverse interaction landscape between transcription factors and the nucleosome."
https://openalex.org/W2891993984,"Mutations of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) underlie a substantial portion of mitochondrial disease burden. These disorders are currently incurable and effectively untreatable, with heterogeneous penetrance, presentation and prognosis. To address the lack of effective treatment for these disorders, we exploited a recently developed mouse model that recapitulates common molecular features of heteroplasmic mtDNA disease in cardiac tissue: the m.5024C>T tRNAAla mouse. Through application of a programmable nuclease therapy approach, using systemically administered, mitochondrially targeted zinc-finger nucleases (mtZFN) delivered by adeno-associated virus, we induced specific elimination of mutant mtDNA across the heart, coupled to a reversion of molecular and biochemical phenotypes. These findings constitute proof of principle that mtDNA heteroplasmy correction using programmable nucleases could provide a therapeutic route for heteroplasmic mitochondrial diseases of diverse genetic origin."
https://openalex.org/W2890448051,"Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are responsible for several metabolic disorders, commonly involving muscle and the central nervous system1. Because of the critical role of mtDNA in oxidative phosphorylation, the majority of pathogenic mtDNA mutations are heteroplasmic, co-existing with wild-type molecules1. Using a mouse model with a heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation2, we tested whether mitochondrial-targeted TALENs (mitoTALENs)3,4 could reduce the mutant mtDNA load in muscle and heart. AAV9-mitoTALEN was administered via intramuscular, intravenous, and intraperitoneal injections. Muscle and heart were efficiently transduced and showed a robust reduction in mutant mtDNA, which was stable over time. The molecular defect, namely a decrease in transfer RNAAla levels, was restored by the treatment. These results showed that mitoTALENs, when expressed in affected tissues, could revert disease-related phenotypes in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2891354340,"To uncover the circuit-level alterations that underlie atypical sensory processing associated with autism, we adopted a symptom-to-circuit approach in the Fmr1-knockout (Fmr1-/-) mouse model of Fragile X syndrome. Using a go/no-go task and in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we find that impaired visual discrimination in Fmr1-/- mice correlates with marked deficits in orientation tuning of principal neurons and with a decrease in the activity of parvalbumin interneurons in primary visual cortex. Restoring visually evoked activity in parvalbumin cells in Fmr1-/- mice with a chemogenetic strategy using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs was sufficient to rescue their behavioral performance. Strikingly, human subjects with Fragile X syndrome exhibit impairments in visual discrimination similar to those in Fmr1-/- mice. These results suggest that manipulating inhibition may help sensory processing in Fragile X syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2892339961,"Unravelling the dynamic molecular interplay behind complex physiological processes such as neuronal plasticity requires the ability to both detect minute changes in biochemical states in response to physiological signals and track multiple signalling activities simultaneously. Fluorescent protein-based biosensors have enabled the real-time monitoring of dynamic signalling processes within the native context of living cells, yet most commonly used biosensors exhibit poor sensitivity (for example, due to low dynamic range) and are limited to imaging signalling activities in isolation. Here, we address this challenge by developing a suite of excitation ratiometric kinase activity biosensors that offer the highest reported dynamic range and enable the detection of subtle changes in signalling activity that could not be reliably detected previously, as well as a suite of single-fluorophore biosensors that enable the simultaneous tracking of as many as six distinct signalling activities in single living cells."

https://openalex.org/W2890820050,"Despite a growing body of evidence, the role of the gut microbiome in cardiovascular diseases is still unclear. Here, we present a systems-genome-wide and metagenome-wide association study on plasma concentrations of 92 cardiovascular-disease-related proteins in the population cohort LifeLines-DEEP. We identified genetic components for 73 proteins and microbial associations for 41 proteins, of which 31 were associated to both. The genetic and microbial factors identified mostly exert additive effects and collectively explain up to 76.6% of inter-individual variation (17.5% on average). Genetics contribute most to concentrations of immune-related proteins, while the gut microbiome contributes most to proteins involved in metabolism and intestinal health. We found several host-microbe interactions that impact proteins involved in epithelial function, lipid metabolism, and central nervous system function. This study provides important evidence for a joint genetic and microbial effect in cardiovascular disease and provides directions for future applications in personalized medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2890876012,"Actin-based protrusions are reinforced through positive feedback, but it is unclear what restricts their size, or limits positive signals when they retract or split. We identify an evolutionarily conserved regulator of actin-based protrusion: CYRI (CYFIP-related Rac interactor) also known as Fam49 (family of unknown function 49). CYRI binds activated Rac1 via a domain of unknown function (DUF1394) shared with CYFIP, defining DUF1394 as a Rac1-binding module. CYRI-depleted cells have broad lamellipodia enriched in Scar/WAVE, but reduced protrusion–retraction dynamics. Pseudopods induced by optogenetic Rac1 activation in CYRI-depleted cells are larger and longer lived. Conversely, CYRI overexpression suppresses recruitment of active Scar/WAVE to the cell edge, resulting in short-lived, unproductive protrusions. CYRI thus focuses protrusion signals and regulates pseudopod complexity by inhibiting Scar/WAVE-induced actin polymerization. It thus behaves like a ‘local inhibitor’ as predicted in widely accepted mathematical models, but not previously identified in cells. CYRI therefore regulates chemotaxis, cell migration and epithelial polarization by controlling the polarity and plasticity of protrusions."
https://openalex.org/W2890492662,"Microtubules are central elements of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton that often function as part of branched networks. Current models for branching include nucleation of new microtubules from severed microtubule seeds or from γ-tubulin recruited to the side of a pre-existing microtubule. Here, we found that microtubules can be directly remodelled into branched structures by the microtubule-remodelling factor SSNA1 (also known as NA14 or DIP13). The branching activity of SSNA1 relies on its ability to self-assemble into fibrils in a head-to-tail fashion. SSNA1 fibrils guide protofilaments of a microtubule to split apart to form daughter microtubules. We further found that SSNA1 localizes at axon branching sites and has a key role in neuronal development. SSNA1 mutants that abolish microtubule branching in vitro also fail to promote axon development and branching when overexpressed in neurons. We have, therefore, discovered a mechanism for microtubule branching and implicated its role in neuronal development. Basnet et al. discover that in vitro SSNA1 forms fibrils that attach along protofilaments and guide these to grow away from microtubules, forming templates for branched microtubules. SSNA1 mutations that perturb this process lead to defective axon branching in primary neurons."

However, data are limited in children and HIV-infected persons.Asymptomatic South African contacts <5 years (n = 87; HIV-uninfected), or symptomatic individuals of all ages presenting to clinics with suspected TB (n = 1003; 30% HIV-infected) were recruited from eight South African centres. C-Tb and TST were allocated to either forearm double blinded. Samples for QFT were collected in parallel, and test-positivity rates were compared.In participants with microbiologically confirmed TB (n = 75; 45% HIV-infected) sensitivity of C-Tb, TST and QFT were similar (72% versus 75% versus 73%; p>0.5). All 3 tests had similar positivity rates in HIV-infected participants with active TB, however, positivity rates were reduced when CD4 counts were <100 cells/μL. In participants where active TB was excluded (n = 920), C-Tb (41%), TST (43%), and QFT (44%) also had similar test-positivity rates. Among asymptomatic contacts aged below five, 32% (28/87) tested positive with C-Tb and 32% (28/87) with TST (concordance 89%). Overall, C-Tb and TST showed a similar safety profile.C-Tb was safe and showed similar test-positivity rates, compared to TST and QFT, in children and HIV-infected persons with active or latent M. tuberculosis infection.

CET and stromal thickness were obtained using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) before and after OK lens wear. Changes in refractive error and corneal topography data were obtained. The correlation between refractive change and corneal thickness change, and various refractive, lens, and topographic parameters were analyzed using simple regression analysis.Mean refractive error changed by 1.75 ± 0.79 diopters (D). The mean CET of the center zone (2 mm in diameter), paracenter (2 to 5 mm annular ring: 1 to 2.5 mm from center), and mid-periphery (5 to 6 mm annular ring: 2.5 to 3 mm from center) changed by -8.4, -1.4, and +2.7 μm, respectively, after OK lens wear. There was an increase of 2.0, 3.3, and 3.9 μm, respectively, in the center, paracenter, and mid-periphery of the stroma. A larger refractive correction was associated with a flatter base curve of the lens, larger decrease in the central epithelium, and smaller treatment diameter in corneal topography.OK lenses caused the central corneal epithelium to thin while the mid-peripheral epithelium and stroma became thicker. Refractive changes during OK are associated with changes in central epithelial thickness, while stromal changes did not contribute significantly."
https://openalex.org/W2892087916,"Pre-eclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy characterised by hypertension and sodium retention by the kidneys. To identify changes in sodium uptake proteins in the tubules of the distal nephron, we studied their expression in urinary extracellular vesicles or exosomes (uEVs). Urine was collected from women with pre-eclampsia or during normal pregnancy, and from healthy non-pregnant controls. uEVs were isolated by centrifugation and analyzed by Western blot. Expression, proteolytic cleavage and phosphorylation was determined by densitometric analysis normalized to the exosome marker CD9. Results showed a significant increase in phosphorylation of the activating S130 site in NKCC2, the drug target for frusemide, in women with pre-eclampsia compared with normal pregnant women. Phosphorylation of the activating sites T101/105 in NKCC2 was similar but the activating T60 site in NCC, the drug target for thiazide diuretics, showed significantly less phosphorylation in pre-eclampsia compared with normal pregnancy. Expression of the larger forms of the α subunit of ENaC, the drug target for amiloride, was significantly greater in pre-eclampsia, with more fragmentation of theγ subunit. The differences observed are predicted to increase the activity of NKCC2 and ENaC while reducing that of NCC. This will increase sodium reabsorption, and so contribute to hypertension in pre-eclampsia."

They are widely distributed in biology, having been found in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and certain viruses. Most characterized prokaryotic sialidases are from organisms that are pathogenic or commensal with mammals. However, in this study, we used functional metagenomic screening to seek microbial sialidases encoded by environmental DNA isolated from an extreme ecological niche, a thermal spring. Using recombinant expression of potential exosialidase candidates and a fluorogenic sialidase substrate, we discovered an exosialidase having no homology to known sialidases. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that this protein is a member of a small family of bacterial proteins of previously unknown function. Proton NMR revealed that this enzyme functions via an inverting catalytic mechanism, a biochemical property that is distinct from those of known exosialidases.

This unique inverting exosialidase defines a new CAZy glycoside hydrolase family we have designated GH156. Enzymes are nature's biological catalysts. They perform chemical reactions with remarkable speed and specificity, making them critical for the biochemical processes that sustain life. Most enzymes have evolved to perform their function under moderate environmental conditions that support the majority of life on our planet. However, many organisms thrive in physically and chemically extreme environments such as hot springs, hydrothermal vents, hypersaline ponds, evaporation salterns, and acidic or soda lakes. These extremophiles often produce enzymes with biochemical properties that have been uniquely shaped by their extreme surroundings. As such, the study of enzymes from microbial communities that populate extreme environments is of interest to both basic science and biotechnology. Over the past decade, functional metagenomics has become increasingly popular for identification of novel enzyme activities in nature. In a functional metagenomics workflow, high-molecular-weight DNA is extracted en masse from microbes that populate an environmental niche. This environmental DNA is cloned into a fosmid vector and introduced into a host cell, often Escherichia coli (1Leis B. Angelov A. Liebl W. Screening and expression of genes from metagenomes.Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2013; 83 (23651593): 1-6810.1016/B978-0-12-407678-5.00001-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Individual E. coli clones can then be screened in high throughput for expression of a desired enzyme activity using an appropriate reporter substrate. This approach is advantageous because it allows for enzyme discovery from both cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms from any environmental niche. Additionally, because the screening is based on enzyme activity and not sequence similarity to known enzymes, truly novel and unique proteins can be identified. Functional metagenomics has been used to identify a variety of carbohydrate hydrolases (glycosidases) from environmental libraries (2Cheng J. Romantsov T. Engel K. Doxey A.C. Rose D.R. Neufeld J.D.

Most of these studies have interrogated libraries from mesophilic microbial populations from intestinal, terrestrials or aquatic niches.

The majority of glycoside hydrolase functional metagenomics studies have sought enzymes involved in degradation of plant biomass, an expected ability of many microbial populations that occupy terrestrial niche. However, the diversity of glycosidase specificities present in extremophile populations remains largely unexplored. We have an interest in enzymes that degrade complex oligosaccharides found on eukaryotic glycoproteins and glycolipids. As such, we have begun screening various extremophile libraries for activities typically associated with complex glycan degradation (e.g. sialidases, galactosidases, fucosidases, mannosidases, etc.). In the present study, we conducted a functional metagenomic screen of an environmental DNA library from a freshwater thermal spring (average temperature, ∼60 °C) for enzymes capable of hydrolysis of sialic acids (“sialidases” or sometimes “neuraminidases”; EC 3.2.1.18). Sialic acids are a structurally diverse family of monosaccharides that share a common nine-carbon backbone. In eukaryotes, they are generally found in a terminal position on N-glycans, O-glycans, glycosphingolipids, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor side branches. Additionally, many bacteria that closely associate with animals incorporate sialic acids into their cell walls (12Vimr E.R. Kalivoda K.A. Deszo E.L. Steenbergen S.M. Diversity of microbial sialic acid metabolism.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68 (15007099): 132-15310.1128/MMBR.68.1.132-153.2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In mammals, the most common form of sialic acid is modified at the C-5 position with an acetyl group (Neu5Ac). However, in nonhuman vertebrates a hydroxylated acetyl group (Neu5Gc) can occupy the C-5 position. Commonly, a sialic acid residue is attached to an adjacent neutral sugar (e.g. galactose, GalNAc, GlcNAc) via an α2–3 or α2–6 linkage. However, other linkages are also possible, including polysialic acid chains, in which many Neu5Ac residues are each connected via an α2–8 linkage (13Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J. Freeze H. Stanley P. Bertozzi C. Hart G. Etzler M. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 195-209Google Scholar). Sialidases are enzymes that catalyze hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond that links a sialic acid to a subterminal sugar in an oligosaccharide. They are widely distributed in biology and have been found in animals, fungi, protozoa, bacteria, and many viruses. Based on their amino acid sequences, sialidases have been classified into four CAZy (Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes Database, www.cazy.org) 2Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. hydrolase families (14Lombard V.

Families GH33, GH34, and GH83 each contain exosialidases, enzymes that release a terminal sialic acid from oligosaccharides. In addition, family GH58 comprises endosialidases, enzymes that cleave within a polysialic acid chain (15Petter J.G. Vimr E.R.

In the present study, we report functional metagenomic screening of a freshwater thermal hot spring fosmid library for sialidase activity. To our knowledge, this is the first functional metagenomic survey aimed at identification of sialidase activity from an extreme environment. We report the discovery and biochemical characterization of a novel exosialidase that defines a new CAZy glycoside hydrolase family (GH156). Additionally, we show that this newly found enzyme catalyzes sialic acid hydrolysis via an inverting reaction mechanism, the first example of a WT exosialidase with this ability. A small metagenomic DNA library was constructed from environmental DNA isolated from hot spring mats collected in Dixie Valley, Nevada. The library was introduced into E. coli, and 616 individual clones were arrayed into two 384-well plates to facilitate enzyme screening. Restriction fragment analysis of 12 randomly selected library clones indicated an average cloned insert size of ∼30–40 kb (Fig. 1A). Additionally, Sanger sequencing of the ends of each insert revealed that cloned DNA originated from both known and unknown bacterial species. Among the known species were the thermophiles Caldilinea aerophila and Thermomicrobium roseum (29Sekiguchi Y. Yamada T. Hanada S. Ohashi A. Harada H. Kamagata Y.

Other clones were related to Chloroflexus sp., Thermocrinis ruber, or Acidobacteria bacterium, and five clones contained DNA from unknown origins. Thus, even in a small sampling of randomly isolated clones, the library harbored genetic material from a diverse range of microbes. To identify active sialidases, the arrayed clones were screened with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (X-Neu5Ac) 3The abbreviations used are: X-Neu5Ac5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid4MU-α-Neu5Ac2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acidcontigcontiguous sequence obtained by assembly of shorter overlapping sequences2AB2-aminobenzamideSLN-2AB2AB-labeled sialyl-N-acetyllactosamineUPLC–HILIC–FLRultra-HPLC with fluorescence detectionNeuAα2–3,6,8,9-neuraminidase AIPTGisopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. and 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (4MU-α-Neu5Ac) substrates in agar plate and cell lysate assays, respectively. In the agar plate screen, a single colony (designated G7) hydrolyzed X-Neu5Ac and turned blue after an overnight incubation at 37 °C and several days of incubation at 4°C (Fig. 1B). In the cell lysate screen, the same clone, G7, was identified by measuring an increase in fluorescence caused by the hydrolysis of 4MU-α-Neu5Ac (Fig. 1C). No additional clones gave rise to detectable sialidase activity. 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid contiguous sequence obtained by assembly of shorter overlapping sequences 2-aminobenzamide 2AB-labeled sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine ultra-HPLC with fluorescence detection α2–3,6,8,9-neuraminidase A isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. To identify the gene responsible for the observed sialidase activity, fosmid G7 was sequenced using the PacBio RS II platform. A total of 44,770 reads were generated with an average insert size of 7,523 bp and an average polymerase read length of 15,285 bp. The reads were assembled with the RS_HGAP_Assembly.3 algorithm (31Chin C.S. Alexander D.H. Marks P. Klammer A.A. Drake J. Heiner C. Clum A. Copeland A. Huddleston J. Eichler E.E. Turner S.W. Korlach J. Nonhybrid, finished microbial genome assemblies from long-read SMRT sequencing data.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 (23644548): 563-56910.1038/nmeth.2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (2973) Google Scholar). After removal of the repeat region (often observed during de novo assembly of circular sequences), a single contig corresponding to the full insert nucleotide sequence (41,198 bp) was obtained (GenBankTM accession number MH016668). The sequence coverage was ∼8,000×. The fosmid insert did not match any DNA sequence in GenBankTM, indicating that it was from a previously unsequenced organism. The fosmid G7 DNA sequence encoded 40 putative ORFs that were predicted by MetaGeneMark (32Zhu W. Lomsadze A. Borodovsky M. Ab initio gene identification in metagenomic sequences.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 (e132) (20403810): e13210.1093/nar/gkq275Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). BLASTP analysis of the nonredundant GenBankTM protein sequence database was performed using each predicted ORF protein sequence as a query. Based on the observed similarity of each ORF to homologous proteins in GenBankTM, the 40 ORFs were classified into three categories: (i) proteins of known function, (ii) proteins involved in saccharide utilization, and (iii) hypothetical proteins of unknown function (Fig. 2, A and B). Of the 40 ORFs, four showed similarity to proteins involved in saccharide utilization, and none showed similarity to proteins from the known CAZy sialidase families GH33, GH34, GH58, and GH83. Because sequence analysis did not identify an obvious sialidase candidate among the 40 sequenced ORFs, transposon mutagenesis was performed to disrupt expression of the sialidase activity. Tn5 mutagenesis was used to randomly insert a kanamycin cassette into fosmid G7 under conditions that minimized multiple insertion events. A total of 192 mutants were assayed for sialidase activity using the substrate 4MU-α-Neu5Ac (Fig. S1). Seventeen mutants with abolished sialidase activity were identified. Each of these mutants was bidirectionally Sanger-sequenced with transposon-specific primers to identify the element’s insertion site. Multiple transposon insertion events were observed for seven mutants, and they were not further investigated. A map of the G7 insertion sites for the remaining ten mutants is shown in Fig. 3A. All loss-of-function insertions clustered to a ∼5-kb region of fosmid G7 containing several ORFs with similarity to enzymes that hydrolyze or metabolize sugars (Figs. 2A and 3A). The majority of insertions occurred in ORF9 (annotated as encoding a putative α-l-fucosidase) or ORF12 (annotated as encoding a “protein of unknown function”). To determine whether either ORF9 or ORF12 encoded a protein with sialidase activity, each was expressed using the PURExpress in vitro protein synthesis system (Fig. 3B) and tested for its ability to cleave 4MU-α-Neu5Ac (Fig. 3C). The expressed product from ORF12 (ORF12p) generated a fluorescence signal ∼27 times higher than the no DNA control reaction (the PURExpress mix alone). Expression of ORF9 yielded no sialidase activity. Because the deduced protein sequence of ORF9 (ORF9p) had sequence homology to α-l-fucosidases, the ability of in vitro expressed ORF9p to cleave the chromogenic fucosidase substrate 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl α-l-fucopyranoside was also tested. Light absorbance at 405 nm was approximately six times higher for ORF9p than the negative control, confirming that the ORF9 encoded an α-fucosidase, not an exosialidase. Together, these data support the conclusion that the gene product from ORF12 (Fig. 3D; GenBankTM accession number MH016668) is solely responsible for the hydrolysis of 4MU-α-Neu5Ac observed during primary screening. Furthermore, because ORFs 8–12 are co-directionally oriented and are each related in some way to saccharide metabolism, it is plausible that these genes are co-transcribed in the organism from which the locus originates and in E. coli. This could account for the observation of reduced sialidase activity upon insertion of Tn5 into multiple positions in this region. To facilitate biochemical characterization of ORF12p, an expression DNA construct encoding ORF12p with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (ORF12p–His) was assembled. ORF12p–His was expressed in E. coli and purified using nickel-affinity chromatography (Fig. 4A). The substrate 3′-SLN-2AB was used to determine the optimum pH and temperature of the ORF12 sialidase as described under “Experimental procedures.” A pH optimum of 5.0–5.5 was observed (Fig. 4B). The enzyme showed optimal activity at 37 °C and retained at least 50% activity at 60 °C (Fig. 4C). No metal ions were required for activity (Fig. 4D). Reaction kinetics were determined using the substrate 4MU-α-Neu5Ac. The initial reaction rates were determined at several substrate concentrations (Fig. 4E). The Km was calculated to be 62 μm, and the kcat was calculated to be 2.3 s−1. The specificity of purified ORF12p–His was assayed using 2-aminobenzamide–labeled 3′- and 6′-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine substrates (termed 3′-SLN-2AB and 6′-SLN-2AB, respectively), a GD3 ganglioside headgroup glycan (Neu5Ac(α2–8)Neu5Ac(α2–3)Gal(β1–4)Glc-2AB) and G2S2 biantennary N-glycans with two terminal Neu5Gc or Neu5Ac residues (G2S2-Ac or G2S2-Gc). Digestion products were analyzed by ultra-HPLC with fluorescence detection (UPLC–HILIC–FLR) (Fig. 5). Negative control reactions consisting of each substrate and no enzyme yielded a single major peak for all five substrates (Fig. 5, A–E, top panels). A positive control reaction using commercial α2–3,6,8,9-neuraminidase A (NeuA; New England Biolabs) resulted in a shift of each substrate, illustrating complete removal of α2–3–, α2–6–, and α2–8–terminal sialic acid (Fig. 5, A–E, bottom panels). This same peak shift was observed for 3′-SNL-2AB and 6′-SNL-25AB substrates when incubated with purified ORF12p–His, indicating that this enzyme was able to hydrolyze both terminal α2–3– and α2–6–Neu5Ac (Fig. 5, A and B, middle panels) and confirming the ability of ORF12p–His to function as an exosialidase. The peak corresponding to the released glycan from GD3 ganglioside did not shift upon incubation with ORF12p–His, confirming the enzyme’s inability to hydrolyze α2–8–linked sialic acid (Fig. 5C, middle panel). N-Glycan substrates G2S2-Ac and G2S2-Gc were both hydrolyzed by ORF12p–His, indicating that this enzyme can hydrolyze both terminal Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc from complex N-glycan structures (Fig. 5, D and E, middle panels). However, the enzyme showed a preference for Neu5Ac. In addition, the enzyme was assayed on a 2AB-labeled O-glycan library (Fig. S2) and showed the ability to hydrolyze terminal sialic acid linked to GalNAc or galactose residues. Glycoside hydrolases are grouped into two mechanistic classes: inverting or retaining enzymes, depending on whether the stereochemistry of the substrate’s anomeric carbon is inverted or retained upon hydrolysis. To date, known exosialidases function as retaining glycoside hydrolases, because they hydrolyze terminal Neu5Ac with net retention of its overall anomeric configuration (24Wilson J.C. Angus D.I.

Proton NMR (1H NMR) spectroscopy was used to determine whether ORF12p functions via a retaining or inverting mechanism. In this experiment, purified ORF12p–His was incubated with the 4MU-α-Neu5Ac substrate. Data analysis focused on the up-field region of the NMR spectra, where signals from the axial and equatorial protons in the 3-position of Neu5Ac appear. The initial NMR spectrum (Fig. 6A) showed only the axial (α-MU-H3a) and equatorial (α-MU-H3e) protons from the substrate 4MU-α-Neu5Ac at 1.99 and 2.86 ppm, respectively. The first additional set of signals (H3a and H3e) appeared after only a few minutes at 1.81 and 2.20 ppm. These signals corresponded to β-Neu5Ac that had been released from the substrate by the enzyme. The signal set of H3a and H3e corresponding to α-Neu5Ac (at 1.61 and 2.72 ppm) appeared after ∼1 h and remained very small throughout the remaining reaction. This reflects spontaneous mutarotation of the β-Neu5Ac product to its α conformer and is not a result of the action of the sialidase. These data unambiguously show that the ORF12 sialidase initially produces β-NeuAc from 4MU-α-Neu5Ac and supports the conclusion that the enzyme functions via an inverting mechanism. A control experiment was run with purified NeuA (New England Biolabs), a known retaining exosialidase from the GH33 family (33Friebolin H. Brossmer R. Keilich G. Ziegler D. Supp M.

These peaks were initially larger than the H3a and H3e β-Neu5Ac peaks (1.85 and 2.03 ppm, respectively). However, after 130 min, the peaks of the β-anomer became more prominent than those of the α-anomer, consistent with the spontaneous mutarotation of the α-Neu5Ac product to its β-Neu5Ac anomer.

Pericytes (PCs) have been implicated in the regulation of neutrophil transmigration, and previous work demonstrates that endothelial cell (EC)-derived signals reduce PC barrier function; however, the signaling mechanisms are unknown. Here, we demonstrate a novel role for EC-derived macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in inhibiting PC contractility and facilitating neutrophil transmigration. With the use of micro-ELISAs, RNA sequencing, quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry, we found that ECs secrete MIF, and PCs upregulate CD74 in response to TNF-α. We demonstrate that EC-derived MIF decreases PC contractility on 2-dimensional silicone substrates via reduction of phosphorylated myosin light chain. With the use of an in vitro microvascular model of the human EC-PC barrier, we demonstrate that MIF decreases the PC barrier to human neutrophil transmigration by increasing intercellular PC gap formation. For the first time, an EC-specific MIF knockout mouse was used to investigate the effects of selective deletion of EC MIF. In a model of acute lung injury, selective deletion of EC MIF decreases neutrophil infiltration to the bronchoalveolar lavage and tissue and simultaneously decreases PC relaxation by increasing myosin light-chain phosphorylation. We conclude that paracrine signals from EC via MIF decrease PC contraction and enhance PC-regulated neutrophil transmigration.-Pellowe, A.

https://openalex.org/W2890154515,"Sealing ring formation is a requirement for osteoclast function. We have recently identified the role of an actin-bundling protein L-plastin in the assembly of nascent sealing zones (NSZs) at the early phase of sealing ring formation in osteoclasts. TNF-α signaling regulates this actin assembly by the phosphorylation of L-plastin on serine -5 and -7 residues at the amino-terminal end. These NSZs function as a core for integrin localization and coordinating integrin signaling required for maturation into fully functional sealing rings. Our goal is to elucidate the essential function of L-plastin phosphorylation in actin bundling, a process required for NSZs formation. The present study was undertaken to determine whether targeting serine phosphorylation of cellular L-plastin would be the appropriate approach to attenuate the formation of NSZs. Our approach is to use TAT-fused small molecular weight amino-terminal L-plastin peptides (10 amino acids) containing phospho- Ser-5 and Ser-7. We used peptides unsubstituted (P1) and substituted (P2- P4) at serine-to-alanine residues. Immunoblotting, actin staining, and dentine resorption analyses were done to determine cellular L-plastin phosphorylation, NSZ or sealing ring formation, and osteoclast function, respectively. Immunoblotting for bone formation markers, Alizarin red staining and alkaline phosphatase activity assay have been done to determine the effect of peptides on the mineralization process mediated by osteoblasts. Transduction of unsubstituted (P1) and substituted peptides at either Serine 5 or Serine 7 with Alanine (P3 and P4) demonstrated variable inhibitory effects on the phosphorylation of cellular L-plastin protein. Peptide P1 reduces the following processes substantially: 1) cellular L-plastin phosphorylation; 2) formation of nascent sealing zones and sealing rings; 3) bone resorption. Substitution of both Serine-5 and -7 with Alanine (P2) had no effects on the inhibitory activities described above. Furthermore, either the L-plastin (P1-P5) or (P6) control peptides had a little or no impact on the a) assembly/disassembly of podosomes and migration of osteoclasts; b) mineralization process mediated by osteoblasts in vitro. Small molecular weight peptidomimetics of L-plastin inhibits bone resorption by osteoclasts via attenuation of NSZ and sealing ring formation but not bone formation by osteoblasts in vitro. The L-plastin may be a valuable therapeutic target to treat and prevent diseases associated with bone loss without affecting bone formation."

Twelve healthy adult Beagles (3 females, 9 males) were used in this prospective controlled cross-over trial. Echocardiography was performed with and without 4 mg kg-1 alfaxalone IM with a week wash-out interval. Sedation (19-point scale; 0 = no sedation), cardiopulmonary parameters, blood gas analysis and plasma concentration of alfaxalone were assessed every 5 minutes following the injection (T0). The influence of the alfaxalone plasma concentration and time on physiological variables was tested using a linear model whereas echocardiographic measurements were compared between conscious and alfaxalone-administered dogs using paired t-tests. Compared to baseline, alfaxalone administration was followed by an increase in heart rate (HR) from T5 to T30 and a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) at T10, T25 and T30, in stroke volume (SV; 15 ± 5 to 11 ± 3 ml; P<0.0001), and end-diastolic volume (EDV; 24.7 ± 5.7 to 19.4 ± 4.9 ml).

https://openalex.org/W2892555207,"This study investigates the mechanism and consequences of microRNA-22 (miR-22) induction. Our data revealed for the first time that retinoic acid (RA) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, including short-chain fatty acids and suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA), could individually or in combination induce miR-22. This induction was mediated via RA receptor β (RARβ) binding to a direct repeat 5 (DR5) motif. In addition, we uncovered HDAC1 as a novel miR-22 target. In an miR-22–dependent manner, HDAC inhibitors and RA reduced HDAC1, HDAC4, and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), which were involved in chromatin remodeling of the RARβ and nerve growth factor IB (NUR77). Thus, HDAC inhibitors and RA-induced miR-22 resulted in simultaneous induction of cytoplasmic RARβ and NUR77, leading to apoptosis of colon cancer cells. In mice, miR-22 and its inducers inhibited the growth of xenograft colon cancer. Moreover, tumor size reduction was accompanied by elevated miR-22, NUR77, and RARβ and by reduced HDACs. In human colon polyps and adenocarcinomas, miR-22 and RARβ were consistently reduced, which was associated with elevated HDAC1, HDAC4, and SIRT1 in colon adenocarcinomas.

DRG contain neurons that perform a wide range of sensory functions, including proprioception and the detection of harmful or painful stimuli. Recent evidence suggests that α6β4 nAChRs represent a new molecular target for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Development of neuropathic pain-like symptoms has been shown to be inversely correlated with CHRNA6 expression levels in the DRG of mice (21Wieskopf J.S. Mathur J. Limapichat W. Post M.R.

Strains with high levels of CHRNA6 expression show lower levels of mechanical allodynia in several neuropathic and inflammatory pain models, and those with low levels of CHRNA6 expression are more susceptible to developing neuropathic pain. Intriguingly, CHRNA6 null mice show no analgesic responses to nicotine, whereas mice with a gain-of-function mutation show increased analgesic responses. In addition, a history of chronic pain syndromes in humans correlates with levels of CHRNA6 expression (21Wieskopf J.S. Mathur J. Limapichat W. Post M.R. Al-Qazzaz M. Sorge R.E. Martin L.J.

Rodent models of neuropathic pain are often used to study mechanisms of nociception as well as to evaluate potential therapeutics that can modulate the transmission and perception of pain. However, rodent models can be compromised by a number of species-related factors that complicate translation of results obtained in rodent studies to human clinical trials. One of these factors is the difference in ligand sensitivity between human and rodent receptors and ion channels. Conotoxins are small peptides found in the venom of carnivorous marine snails of the Conus genus and are used by these mollusks to capture prey. α-Conotoxins (α-Ctxs) belong to a subclass of conotoxins and are antagonists of nAChRs. Some α-Ctxs are capable of distinguishing among the various nAChR subtypes (22Giribaldi J. Dutertre S. α-Conotoxins to explore the molecular, physiological and pathophysiological functions of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.Neurosci.

It was later demonstrated that decreased sensitivity of human versus rat nAChRs to Vc1.1 might have contributed to this outcome. It is therefore important to determine how species differences influence receptor sensitivity to ligands. To this end, we have examined the interaction of human and rat α6β4 nAChRs with α-Ctxs to elucidate molecular determinants of ligand potency for this receptor subtype. Through structure–activity studies of PeIA, site-directed mutagenesis of α6 and β4 subunits, X-ray crystallography, and NMR studies of PeIA, we have identified important molecular determinants of α-Ctx potency for human and rat α6β4 nAChRs. The information obtained from these studies offers important insights into the pharmacology of α6β4 nAChRs and might facilitate the development of selective ligands that interact with this potential neuropathic pain target. We chose three α-Ctxs with different sequences to assess their ability to distinguish between human and rat α6/α3β4 nAChRs, namely PeIA (26McIntosh J.M. Plazas P.V. Watkins M. Gomez-Casati M.E.

When tested on human and rat α6/α3β4 nAChRs heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we found that all three α-Ctxs showed higher potency on the human homolog. The IC50 values for inhibition of human α6/α3β4 nAChRs were ∼15-fold lower for PeIA, ∼50-fold lower for PnIA, and >30-fold lower for TxIB than those obtained for rat α6/α3β4 nAChRs (Fig. 2 (A–C) and Table 1). These results suggest that intrinsic differences between human and rat α6/α3β4 nAChRs confer differential sensitivities to α-Ctxs.Figure 2α-Ctxs distinguish between human and rat α6/α3β4 nAChRs.

The closest residue to the ligand-binding pocket that differs in the α6 sequences is located at position 177. In humans, this residue is Ile, but in rat, a Val is present. Analysis of the β4 subunits revealed more significant sequence differences occurring at positions 110, 118, and 119. In human β4, these residues are Leu, Val, and Leu, and in rat, they are Val, Ile, and Gln. These three nonconserved residues are all located in the ligand-binding pocket and might contribute to the species differences in α-Ctxs potencies for inhibition of human and rat α6/α3β4 nAChRs. A series of experiments was performed to determine whether differences in the amino acid sequences of human and rat β4 subunits are important for α-Ctx potency for α6/α3β4 nAChRs. In the first experiment, one group of oocytes was injected with cRNAs encoding human α6/α3 and rat β4 subunits, and another group was injected with cRNAs encoding rat α6/α3 and human β4 subunits. The potencies for PeIA, PnIA, and TxIB were then reassessed on these hybrid combinations with the hypothesis that the IC50 values for receptors composed of human (H) α6/α3 and rat (R) β4 subunits would be similar to Rα6/α3Rβ4 nAChRs. Likewise, the IC50 values for inhibition of Rα6/α3Hβ4 and Hα6/α3Hβ4 nAChRs would also be similar. Consistent with these predictions, the IC50 curves for inhibition of Hα6/α3Rβ4 by PeIA, PnIA, and TxIB are right-shifted toward those for Rα6/α3Rβ4 nAChRs (Fig. 3 (A–C) and Table 2). Conversely, the IC50 curves for inhibition of Rα6/α3Hβ4 are left-shifted toward Hα6/α3Hβ4 nAChRs (Fig. 3 (A–C) and Table 2). These results indicate that the β4 subunit is an important determinant of the species differences in α-Ctx potency for inhibition of α6/α3β4 nAChRs.Table 2PeIA IC50 values for inhibition of α6/α3β4 nAChRs formed by mixing human and rat α6/α3 and β4 subunitsnAChRIC50nmHα6/α3Hβ49.9 (8.2–11.9)aData from Table 1 shown for ease of comparison.Hα6/α3Rβ468.1 (59.8–77.6)Rα6/α3Rβ4154 (143–166)aData from Table 1 shown for ease of comparison.Rα6/α3Hβ437.5 (30.1–46.2)a Data from Table 1 shown for ease of comparison.

In the α6β2β3 nAChR, the canonical α-Ctx ligand-binding site is located at the interface between the α6 and β2 subunits. We aligned the sequences of human and rat β2 subunits and found that residues known to interact with α-Ctxs are strictly conserved (29Cuny H. Yu R. Tae H.S. Kompella S.N. Adams D.J. α-Conotoxins active at α3-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and their molecular determinants for selective inhibition.Br. J.

When we tested PeIA on human and rat α6/α3β2β3 nAChRs, we found that the IC50 values for the two species were nearly identical (Fig. 4A and Table 3). Similar results were obtained for PnIA and TxIB (Fig. 4 (B and C) and Table 3). In all comparisons, a <2-fold difference in the IC50 values was found.Table 3IC50 values for inhibition of human and rat α6/α3β2β3 nAChRs by PeIA, PnIA, and TxIBα-CtxIC50HumanRatnmPeIA16.0 (14.2–18.1)16.3 (13.2–20.2)PnIA2.8 (2.0–3.8)3.3 (3.0–3.6)TxIB291 (255–332)207 (175–244) Open table in a new tab The high sequence similarity of human and rat α6 and β4 subunits allowed us to focus on select residues that might contribute to the species differences in α-Ctx potency for human and rat α6/α3β4 nAChRs. We used site-directed mutagenesis to generate receptor mutants where nonconserved residues of α6 and β4 subunits were switched to the residues found in the homologous positions of the other species and then assessed the effects of these mutations on α6/α3β4 nAChR sensitivity to PeIA. In the α6 subunit, there is an Ile-Val difference between human and rat sequences, respectively, at position 177. We found that when Ile177 of human α6 was switched to Val, the IC50 value of PeIA was similar to the value obtained for human α6/α3β4 nAChRs (Fig. 5A; Table 4), indicating that this residue contributes very little to the species difference in PeIA potency. Next, residues Leu110, Val118, and Leu119 of human β4 were individually switched to Val, Ile, and Gln, respectively, and expressed with human α6/α3 subunits. Similar to the α6I177V mutation, L110V and V118I mutations in the β4 subunit had very little impact on the IC50 value of PeIA (Fig. 5A and Table 4). However, when the α6/α3 subunit was expressed with the β4L119Q mutant subunit, the IC50 value increased by ∼10-fold, and the curve shifted to the right toward that of rat α6/α3β4 nAChRs (Fig. 5A and Table 4). To determine whether residues 118 and 119 might play a combined role in PeIA binding, we made a double V118I,L119Q mutant human β4 subunit and reassessed the potency of PeIA. The sensitivity of the α6/α3β4V118I,L119Q mutant to PeIA was similar to that of the α6/α3β4L119Q single mutant, indicating no added effect with the combined mutations (Fig. 5A and Table 4). To further assess the influence of position 119 on PeIA potency, we made an additional human β4 mutant where Leu119 was changed to Phe, the residue found in the homologous positions of human and rat β2 subunits (Fig. S2). The IC50 value for inhibition of α6/α3β4L119F mutant nAChRs by PeIA was similar (<2-fold difference) to the value for receptors with native β4 subunits (Fig. 5A and Table 4). Mutation experiments were also performed for rat α6/α3β4 nAChRs and, similar to the results found for human receptor α6V177I, β4V110L, β4I118V, and β4Q119F mutations, had very little effect on the sensitivity of rat α6/α3β4 nAChRs to PeIA relative to nonmutated receptors (Fig. 5B and Table 4). However, in contrast to the results obtained with human α6/α3β4L119Q and α6/α3β4V118I,L119Q nAChRs, mutation of the homologous residues of rat β4 had no effect on the sensitivity of rat α6/α3β4 nAChRs to PeIA (Fig. 5B and Table 4). The results of these receptor mutation experiments indicate that position 119 of human β4 plays an important role in the interaction between PeIA and human α6/α3β4 nAChRs, but other factors appear to be involved in determining the lower potency of PeIA for rat α6/α3β4 nAChRs.Table 4Effect of α6/α3 and β4 subunit mutation on the IC50 values for inhibition of human and rat α6/α3β4 nAChRs by PeIAnAChRIC50nmHumanα6/α3β49.9 (8.2–11.9)aData from Table 1 shown for ease of comparison.α6I177V/α3β414.6 (12.3–17.3)α6/α3β4L110V15.7 (13.9–17.8)α6/α3β4V118I10.6 (8.6–13.0)α6/α3β4L119Q94.3 (87.8–101)α6/α3β4L119F13.0 (10.7–15.7)α6/α3β4V118I,L119Q70.7 (66.1–75.6)Ratα6/α3β4154 (143–166)aData from Table 1 shown for ease of comparison.α6V177I/α3β488.7 (76.3–103)α6/α3β4V110L96.3 (85.9–108)α6/α3β4I118V119 (105–134)α6/α3β4Q119L200 (166–250)α6/α3β4Q119F241 (212–274)α6/α3β4I118V,Q119L116 (101–133)a Data from Table 1 shown for ease of comparison.

Diagnosing and treating these lesions require a dermatologic advice. A tele-expertise network in dermatology for prisoners including 8 health facilities in prison and 2 hospital dermatological departments was developed to improve access to dermatologists’ expertise in correctional facilities. Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and costs of tele-expertise in dermatology for prisoners. Methods We carried out a retrospective cohort study on data collected by the information system of the tele-expertise network. We used the MAST (Model for ASsessment of Telemedicine) model to perform a multidimensional assessment including the proportion of patients with a completed treatment plan for the skin lesions, the proportion of technical problems, the quality of the pictures, the investment and operating costs and the satisfaction of the professionals. Results Mean patient age was 34.2 years with 90% men. 511 requests for 450 patients were initiated. The delay from the connection to the tele-expertise software to the validation of the request was inferior to 7 min for 50% of the requests and inferior to 30 min for 85% of the requests. Overall, with tele-expertise, 82% of the patients had a completed treatment plan for the skin lesions, with 2.9% of all patients requiring a later face-to-face appointment or hospitalization, to be compared to a proportion of 35% of patients with a completed treatment plan when tele-expertise was not available. The most frequent lesions were acnea (22%) and atopic dermatitis (18%). The mean cost for one completed treatment plan was €184 by tele-expertise and €315 without tele-expertise. Tele-expertise was well accepted among physicians with all responders (n = 9) willing to continue using it. Conclusion Tele-expertise is a dominant intervention in comparison to a face-to face consultation taking into account the cost of transportation and the proportion of canceled appointments and is acceptable for physicians.

https://openalex.org/W2894059729,"One strategy to control leishmaniasis is vaccination with potent antigens alongside suitable adjuvants. The use of toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists as adjuvants is a promising approach in Leishmania vaccine research. Leishmania (L.) tropica is among the less-investigated Leishmania species and a causative agent of cutaneous and sometimes visceral leishmaniasis with no approved vaccine against it. In the present study, we assessed the adjuvant effects of a TLR4 agonist, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and a TLR7/8 agonist, R848 beside two different types of Leishmania vaccine candidates; namely, whole-cell soluble L. tropica antigen (SLA) and recombinant L. tropica stress-inducible protein-1 (LtSTI1). BALB/c mice were vaccinated three times by the antigens (SLA or LtSTI1) with MPL or R848 and then were challenged by L. tropica. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), parasite load, disease progression and cytokines (IL-10 and IFN-γ) responses were assessed. In general compared to SLA, application of LtSTI1 resulted in higher DTH, higher IFN-γ response and lower lymph node parasite load. Also compared to R848, MPL as an adjuvant resulted in higher DTH and lower lymph node parasite load. Although, no outstanding ability for SLA and R848 in evoking immune responses of BALB/c mice against L. tropica infection could be observed, our data suggest that LtSTI1 and MPL have a better potential to control L. tropica infection and could be pursued for the development of effective vaccination strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2893480704,"While the two mammalian sphingosine kinases, SK1 and SK2, both catalyze the generation of pro-survival sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), their roles vary dependent on their different subcellular localization. SK1 is generally found in the cytoplasm or at the plasma membrane where it can promote cell proliferation and survival. SK2 can be present at the plasma membrane where it appears to have a similar function to SK1, but can also be localized to the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria where it mediates cell death. Although SK2 has been implicated in cancer initiation and progression, the mechanisms regulating SK2 subcellular localization are undefined. Here, we report that SK2 interacts with the intermediate chain subunits of the retrograde-directed transport motor complex, cytoplasmic dynein 1 (DYNC1I1 and -2), and we show that this interaction, particularly with DYNC1I1, facilitates the transport of SK2 away from the plasma membrane. DYNC1I1 is dramatically downregulated in patient samples of glioblastoma (GBM), where lower expression of DYNC1I1 correlates with poorer patient survival. Notably, low DYNC1I1 expression in GBM cells coincided with more SK2 localized to the plasma membrane, where it has been recently implicated in oncogenesis. Re-expression of DYNC1I1 reduced plasma membrane-localized SK2 and extracellular S1P formation, and decreased GBM tumor growth and tumor-associated angiogenesis in vivo. Consistent with this, chemical inhibition of SK2 reduced the viability of patient-derived GBM cells in vitro and decreased GBM tumor growth in vivo. Thus, these findings demonstrate a tumor-suppressive function of DYNC1I1, and uncover new mechanistic insights into SK2 regulation which may have implications in targeting this enzyme as a therapeutic strategy in GBM."

We evaluated the relation between small for gestational age and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonates born to mothers with preeclampsia. We hypothesized that low birth weight is still associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in this homogeneous population. Methods Retrospective single-center cohort study including 141 neonates born between 24 and 30 weeks’ gestation to mothers with preeclampsia. The main outcome measure was moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age. Neonates born small for gestational age (birthweight < 10th percentile on the AUDIPOG curves) were compared to those with appropriate birthweight for gestational age by bivariable analyses and logistic regression models, estimating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Bronchopulmonary dysplasia rates were 61.5% (32/52) and 27.4% (20/73) for small for gestational age and appropriate birthweight for gestational age neonates (p < .001). On adjustment for gestational age and other confounding factors, the risk of moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia was greater for small for gestational age than appropriate birthweight for gestational age neonates (adjusted OR = 5.9, 95% CI [2.2–15.4]), as was the composite outcome death or moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (adjusted OR = 4.7, 95% CI [1.9–11.3]). Conclusions Small for gestational age was associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in very preterm neonates born to mothers with preeclampsia. Registration number CNIL no. 1747084."
https://openalex.org/W2893235978,"Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is performed to relieve pain caused by degenerative disk disease and nerve obstruction. As an alternative to bone graft, autologous concentrated bone marrow aspirate (CBMA) is used to achieve vertebral fusion with a satisfactory success rate. This has been attributed in part to bone marrow-resident mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) with the capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts and generate bone tissue. To date, there has been no study comparing cellular yields, MSC frequencies and their osteogenic potential with ACDF outcome. Patients (n = 24) received ACDF with CBMA and allograft bone matrix. Colony forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F) and CFU-osteoblasts (CFU-O) assays were performed on CBMA samples to enumerate MSCs (CFU-F) and osteogenic MSCs (CFU-O). CFUs were normalized to CBMA volume to define yield and also to mononuclear cells (MNC) to define frequency. After 1-year, fusion rates were good (86.7%) with pain and disability improved. There was a negative relationship between MNC and CFU-F measurements with age of patient and CFU-Os negatively correlated with age in females but not males. Tobacco use did not affect CBMA but was associated with poorer clinical outcome. Surprisingly, we found that while high-grade fusion was not associated with CFU-O, it correlated strongly (p<0.0067) with CBMA containing the lowest frequencies of CFU-F (3.0x10-6–5.83x10-5 CFU-F/MNC). MNC levels alone were not responsible for the results. These observations suggest that osteogenesis by human bone marrow is controlled by homeostatic ratio of MSCs to other cellular bone marrow components rather than absolute level of osteogenic MSCs, and that a lower ratio of MSCs to other cellular components in marrow tends to predict effective osteogenesis during ACDF. The results presented herein challenge the current dogma surrounding the proposed mechanism of MSCs in bone healing."
https://openalex.org/W2891206991,"To date, studies on inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) lack comprehensive epidemiological data. We analyzed detailed prospectively collected clinical and epidemiological data from the IBC Registry at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.Patients with IBC (n = 248) were consecutively diagnosed and prospectively enrolled between November 2006 and April 2013. All patients were newly diagnosed and at least 18 years old. Secondary IBC was excluded. Overall 160 variables were collected and evaluated including sociodemographics, anthropometrics, tobacco and alcohol consumption, reproductive variables, and family history data.Mean age at diagnosis was 51.6 (±11.5 SD) years, and the majority of patients were White (77.8%). A mean BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, irrespective of menopausal status, was observed in 80.2% of all patients, with 82.6% of African Americans being obese. Approximately 42.2% of patients were ever smokers, and 91% reported ever being pregnant. A history of breastfeeding was reported in 54% of patients, with significant differences between ethnic groups in favor of White women (P<0.0001). Other reproductive factors such as use of birth control pills & hormone replacement therapy were also more frequently associated with White women compare to other ethnic groups (P < 0.05). In the multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, African American or Hispanic ethnicity, not having breastfed, higher clinical stage, and TNBC subtype were associated with shorter survival.Our data suggest that IBC is associated with distinct epidemiological profiles. This information could assist in targeting patients with specific preventive strategies based on their modifiable behavioral patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2893167359,"A large body of research has identified cognitive skills associated with overall mathematics achievement, focusing primarily on identifying associates of procedural skills. Conceptual understanding, however, has received less attention, despite its importance for the development of mathematics proficiency. Consequently, we know little about the quantitative and domain-general skills associated with conceptual understanding. Here we investigated 8–10-year-old children’s conceptual understanding of arithmetic, as well as a wide range of basic quantitative skills, numerical representations and domain-general skills. We found that conceptual understanding was most strongly associated with performance on a number line task. This relationship was not explained by the use of particular strategies on the number line task, and may instead reflect children’s knowledge of the structure of the number system. Understanding the skills involved in conceptual learning is important to support efforts by educators to improve children’s conceptual understanding of mathematics."
https://openalex.org/W2893720134,"Epithelial barrier maintenance and regulation requires an intact perijunctional actomyosin ring underneath the cell-cell junctions. By searching for known factors affecting the actin cytoskeleton, we identified Krev interaction trapped protein 1 (KRIT1) as a major regulator for epithelial barrier function through multiple mechanisms. KRIT1 is expressed in both small intestinal and colonic epithelium, and KRIT1 knockdown in differentiated Caco-2 intestinal epithelium decreases epithelial barrier function and increases cation selectivity. KRIT1 knockdown abolished Rho-associated protein kinase-induced and myosin II motor inhibitor-induced barrier loss by limiting both small and large molecule permeability but did not affect myosin light chain kinase-induced increases in epithelial barrier function. These data suggest that KRIT1 participates in Rho-associated protein kinase- and myosin II motor-dependent (but not myosin light chain kinase-dependent) epithelial barrier regulation. KRIT1 knockdown exacerbated low-dose TNF-induced barrier loss, along with increased cleaved caspase-3 production. Both events are blocked by pan-caspase inhibition, indicating that KRIT1 regulates TNF-induced barrier loss through limiting epithelial apoptosis. These data indicate that KRIT1 controls epithelial barrier maintenance and regulation through multiple pathways, suggesting that KRIT1 mutation in cerebral cavernous malformation disease may alter epithelial function and affect human health.-Wang, Y., Li, Y., Zou, J., Polster, S.

https://openalex.org/W2893918676,"Vasomotor response is related to the capacity of the vessel to maintain vascular tone within a narrow range. Two main control mechanisms are involved: the autonomic control of the sympathetic neural drive (global control) and the endothelial smooth cells capacity to respond to mechanical stress by releasing vasoactive factors (peripheral control). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of respiratory muscle training (RMT) on vasomotor response, assessed by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and heart rate variability, in young healthy females. The hypothesis was that RMT could enhance the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic neural drive and reduce vessel shear stress. Thus, twenty-four women were randomly assigned to either RMT or SHAM group. Maximal inspiratory mouth pressure and maximum voluntary ventilation were utilized to assess the effectiveness of the RMT program, which consisted of three sessions of isocapnic hyperventilation/ week for eight weeks, (twenty-four training sessions). Heart rate variability assessed autonomic balance, a global factor regulating the vasomotor response. Endothelial function was determined by measuring brachial artery vasodilation normalized by shear rate (%FMD/SR). After RMT, but not SHAM, maximal inspiratory mouth pressure and maximum voluntary ventilation increased significantly (+31% and +16%, respectively). Changes in heart rate variability were negligible in both groups. Only RMT exhibited a significant increase in %FMD/SR (+45%; p<0.05). These data suggest a positive effect of RMT on vasomotor response that may be due to a reduction in arterial shear stress, and not through modulation of sympatho-vagal balance."
https://openalex.org/W2894141049,"The pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein (α-Syn), eventually resulting in the formation of Lewy bodies and neurites in surviving neurons in the brain. Although α-Syn aggregation has been extensively studied in vitro, there is limited in vivo knowledge on α-Syn aggregation. Here, we used the powerful genetics of Drosophila melanogaster and developed an in vivo assay to monitor α-Syn accumulation by using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. We found that both genetic and pharmacologic manipulations affected α-Syn accumulation. Interestingly, we also found that alterations in the cellular protein degradation mechanisms strongly influenced α-Syn accumulation. Administration of compounds identified as risk factors for Parkinson's disease, such as rotenone or heavy metal ions, had only mild or even no impact on α-Syn accumulation in vivo. Finally, we show that increasing phosphorylation of α-Syn at serine 129 enhances the accumulation and toxicity of α-Syn. Altogether, our study establishes a novel model to study α-Syn accumulation and illustrates the complexity of manipulating proteostasis in vivo.-Prasad, V., Wasser, Y., Hans, F., Goswami, A., Katona, I., Outeiro, T.

https://openalex.org/W2893607604,"Background Depression is a leading cause of disability and may be associated with decreased adherence to ART. We sought to describe the prevalence of depressive symptoms and outcomes one year after screening among patients receiving ART at a large HIV Clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. Methods Adult (≥18) patients who had been on first-line ART between 6–18 months who could communicate in English were eligible. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 and a score ≥10 indicated depression. Results 97 patients enrolled. Patients had been on ART for a median (IQR) of 8 (7–10) months, 61% were female, the median (IQR) age at enrollment was 38 (33–42) years, and the median (IQR) CD4 count at ART initiation was 154.5 (65–263) cells/mm3. 7 (7%) patients were found to have symptoms of depression; 4 (4%) had symptoms of moderate depression (PHQ score of 10–14) and 3 (3%) had symptoms of moderate/severe depression (PHQ score of 15–19). Women (10%) were more likely to have symptoms of depression than men (3%; prevalence difference [PD]: 7.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI]:-1.7%-16.8%); as were patients under the age of 30 (14%) compared to those 30–39 (4%; PD: -10.2; 95% CI: -29.4–9.0%) or ≥40 (9%; PD: -5.5%; -26.1%-15.2%), those with lower CD4 counts at ART initiation (<200 cells/mm3 vs ≥200 cells/mm3: 8% vs 3%; PD: 4.8%; 95% CI: -4.5%-14.0%), and those with high viral loads (>1000 copies/mL vs. <400 copies/mL: 40% vs. 5%; PD: 34.6%; 95% CI: -8.6%-77.6%). No relationship between depressive symptoms and retention in HIV care one year after screening was observed. Conclusions We found a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms compared to findings from other HIV-positive populations in South Africa but more than one-third of patients with an elevated viral load had evidence of depression. Further research on the relationship between depression, adherence, and viral failure is warranted as this may present an opportunity for early interventions to improve treatment outcomes and reduce the need for second-line treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2892697961,"There exists a general recognition of the fact that mitochondrial remodelling as a result of aerobic glycolysis ensures human somatic cells to revert to a more primitive-form exhibiting stem-like phenotype. The present study is an attempt to demonstrate that miR-2909 RNomics within human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has the inherent capacity to re-program these cells to exhibit mitochondrial remodelling paralleled by aerobic glycolysis together with intracellular lipid inclusions. Such re-programmed PBMCs also expressed genes having ability to sustain their de-differentiation state and survival.Human PBMCs were programed to ectopically express miR-2909.

Nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio (N/C), quantification of ATP levels, GSSG/GSH ratio, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity, secreted lactate concentrations, activity of antioxidant enzymes, levels of esterified cholesterol and triglycerides and flow-cytometric detection of apoptosis confirmed the compromised nature of mitochondrial function induced by ectopic miR-2909 expression in human PBMCs.Based upon these results we propose that AATF gene-encoded miR-2909 may act as an epigenetic switch for cellular aerobic-glycolysis to ensure de-differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2893029426,"cAMP is a universal second messenger regulating a plethora of processes in the kidney. Two downstream effectors of cAMP are PKA and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac), which, unlike PKA, is often linked to elevation of [Ca2+]i. While both Epac isoforms (Epac1 and Epac2) are expressed along the nephron, their relevance in the kidney remains obscure. We combined ratiometric calcium imaging with quantitative immunoblotting, immunofluorescent confocal microscopy, and balance studies in mice lacking Epac1 or Epac2 to determine the role of Epac in renal water-solute handling. Epac1−/− and Epac2−/− mice developed polyuria despite elevated arginine vasopressin levels. We did not detect major deficiencies in arginine vasopressin [Ca2+]i signaling in split-opened collecting ducts or decreases in aquaporin water channel type 2 levels. Instead, sodium-hydrogen exchanger type 3 levels in the proximal tubule were dramatically reduced in Epac1−/− and Epac2−/− mice. Water deprivation revealed persisting polyuria, impaired urinary concentration ability, and augmented urinary excretion of Na+ and urea in both mutant mice. In summary, we report a nonredundant contribution of Epac isoforms to renal function. Deletion of Epac1 and Epac2 decreases sodium–hydrogen exchanger type 3 expression in the proximal tubule, leading to polyuria and osmotic diuresis.—Cherezova, A., Tomilin, V., Buncha, V., Zaika, O., Ortiz, P.

https://openalex.org/W2891174387,"The vertebrate immune response is mediated through highly adaptive, quickly evolving cell surface receptors, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHC molecules bind and present a diverse array of pathogenic molecules and trigger a cascade of defenses. Use of MHC variation as a marker for population health has also evolved quickly following advances in sequencing methods. We applied a combination of traditional and next generation sequencing methodology to characterize coding (peptide binding region) and regulatory (proximal promoter) sequence variation in MHC Class II DQA and DQB genes between estuarine and coastal populations of the bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, an apex predator whose health status is indicative of anthropogenic impacts on the ecosystem. The coding regions had 10 alleles each at DQA and DQB; the promoters had 6 and 7 alleles at DQA and DQB, respectively with variation within key regulatory motifs. Positive selection was observed for the coding regions of both genes while both coding and promoter regions exhibited geographic differences in allele composition that likely indicates diversifying selection across habitats. Most notable was the discovery of a complete duplication of a 14-bp T-box motif in the DQA promoter. Four class II promoter regions (DQA, DQB, DRA, DRB) were characterized in species from four cetacean families (Delphinidae, Monodontidae, Lipotidae, and Physeteridae) and revealed substantial promoter structural diversity across this order. Peptide binding regions may not be the only source of adaptive potential within cetacean MHC for responding to pathogenic threats. These findings are the first analysis of cetacean MHC regulatory motifs, which may divulge unique immunogenetic strategies among cetaceans and reveal how MHC transcriptional control continues to evolve. The combined MHC regulatory and coding data provide new genetic context for distinct vulnerability profiles between coastal and estuarine populations, which are key concerns for health and risk management."
https://openalex.org/W2891816502,"Tuberculin skin test (TST) is used most widely for the detection of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), even though evidences suggest that it could be underreporting the prevalence of LTBI particularly in high disease-burden settings. We have explored whether in vivo (TST) and in vitro (cell-proliferative) T cell responses to PPD can serve as complementary measures. In addition, we also probed whether in vitro T cell response to cell-membrane antigens (Mem) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) can serve as a biomarker for LTBI. Study subjects comprised 43 healthcare workers (HCWs), and 9 smear-positive TB patients served as ‘disease control’. To measure proliferative T cell responses, 0.1 ml blood (diluted 1:10) was incubated (5 days) with test or control antigen. Cells were stained with fluorescent antibodies to T cell (CD3+/CD4+/CD8+) surface markers and, after fixation and permeabilization, to nuclear proliferation marker Ki67. Data was acquired on a flow cytometer. HCWs who had an intimate exposure to MTB showed significantly higher TST positivity (85%) than the rest (43%), notwithstanding their BCG vaccination status. The proliferative responses of CD4+ and CD8+ subsets of T cells were comparable. Sixty seven and 100% TST-negative HCWs, respectively, were positive for proliferative T cell response to PPD and MTBMem. Cumulative positivity (TST or in vitro) was 86% with PPD and 100% with MTBMem indicating complementarity of the two responses. As standalone in vitro assay, MTBMem provided a significantly higher positivity (95%) than PPD (67%). T cell responses of TB patients were ‘generally’ depressed, having implications for the development of immunological assays for ‘progressive’ LTBI. Altogether, these results demonstrate that in vivo and in vitro T cell responses to PPD are complementary and in vitro response to MTBMem can be developed as a highly sensitive biomarker for LTBI."
https://openalex.org/W2892487216,"We observed in PRESTO-Tango β-arrestin recruitment assays that the α1-adrenergic receptor (AR) antagonist prazosin activates chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor (CXCR)4. This prompted us to further examine this unexpected pharmacological behavior. We screened a panel of 14 α1/2- and β1/2/3-AR antagonists for CXCR4 and atypical chemokine receptor (ACKR)3 agonist activity in PRESTO-Tango assays against the cognate agonist CXCL12. We observed that multiple α1-AR antagonists activate CXCR4 (CXCL12 = prazosin = cyclazosin > doxazosin) and ACKR3 (CXCL12 = prazosin = cyclazosin > alfuzosin = doxazosin = phentolamine > terazosin = silodosin = tamsulosin). The two strongest CXCR4/ACKR3 activators, prazosin and cyclazosin, were selected for a more detailed evaluation. We found that the drugs dose-dependently activate both receptors in β-arrestin recruitment assays, stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HEK293 cells overexpressing each receptor, and that their effects on CXCR4 could be inhibited with AMD3100. Both α1-AR antagonists induced significant chemical shift changes in the 1H-13C-heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum of CXCR4 and ACKR3 in membranes, suggesting receptor binding. Furthermore, prazosin and cyclazosin induced internalization of endogenous CXCR4/ACKR3 in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMC). While these drugs did not in induce chemotaxis in hVSMC, they inhibited CXCL12-induced chemotaxis with high efficacy and potency (IC50: prazosin—4.5 nM, cyclazosin 11.6 pM). Our findings reveal unexpected pharmacological properties of prazosin, cyclazosin, and likely other α1-AR antagonists. The results of the present study imply that prazosin and cyclazosin are biased or partial CXCR4/ACKR3 agonists, which function as potent CXCL12 antagonists. Our findings could provide a mechanistic basis for previously observed anti-cancer properties of α1-AR antagonists and support the concept that prazosin could be re-purposed for the treatment of disease processes in which CXCR4 and ACKR3 are thought to play significant pathophysiological roles, such as cancer metastases or various autoimmune pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2893006449,"How effective groups are in making decisions is a long-standing question in studying human and animal behaviour. Despite the limited social and cognitive abilities of younger people, skills which are often required for collective intelligence, studies of group performance have been limited to adults. Using a simple task of estimating the number of sweets in jars, we show in two experiments that adolescents at least as young as 11 years old improve their estimation accuracy after a period of group discussion, demonstrating collective intelligence. Although this effect was robust to the overall distribution of initial estimates, when the task generated positively skewed estimates, the geometric mean of initial estimates gave the best fit to the data compared to other tested aggregation rules. A geometric mean heuristic in consensus decision making is also likely to apply to adults, as it provides a robust and well-performing rule for aggregating different opinions. The geometric mean rule is likely to be based on an intuitive logarithmic-like number representation, and our study suggests that this mental number scaling may be beneficial in collective decisions."

IgM was found to be the most cross reactive antibody class, Pearson's r = 0.7-0.92, for very distant bacterial species such as Lactobacillus and E. coli.High correlation in IgG levels was found for Gammaproteobacteria and LPS (from E. coli) (r = 0.77 for LPS vs. P. aeruginosa to r = 0.98 for LPS vs. E.coli), whereas this correlation was lower in the control group (r = 0.49 for LPS vs. P. aeruginosa to r = 0.66 for LPS vs. E.coli). The correlation was also analyzed between total IgG and IgG subclasses specific for the same microorganism, and IgG2 was identified as the main subclass recognising different microorganisms, as well as recognising LPS. Upon correlation of IgG with IgA for the same microorganism absence of or negative correlation was found between bacteria-specific IgA and IgG in case of Lactobacillus and Staphylococcusgeni, whereas correlation was absent or positive for Candida albicans, Enterococcusfaecalis,Streptococcus species tested in professional athletes. Opposite results were obtained for the control group. Outlined here is a simple experimental procedure and data analysis which yields functional significance and which can be used for determining the similarities between microorganisms from the aspect of the humoral immune system, for determining the main IgG subclass involved in an immune response as well as for the analysis of different target populations."
https://openalex.org/W2894439351,"Introduction Maternal delivery is the costliest event during pregnancy, especially if a complicated delivery occurs that requires emergency hospital services. A health financing scheme or program that covers comprehensive maternal services, including specialized hospital services in the benefits health package, enhances maternal survival and improves financial risk protection. Objectives The objective of this study is to identify factors that enable the inclusion of comprehensive maternal services in the benefits package of emerging health financing schemes in low and middle-income countries across selected world regions. Comprehensive care is presumed if, in addition to normal delivery, primary health care, and secondary or tertiary hospital care are included. Methods Multilevel regression analysis is performed on 220 health financing schemes and programs initiated during the period 1990–2014, in 40 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Findings About two-thirds of emerging health financing schemes explicitly include maternal care in the benefits package, and less-than-half cover comprehensive maternal services. Provision of any type of maternal services and comprehensive services is significantly associated with the presence of donors/philanthropies as funders, and beneficiaries possessing an ID card that links them to entitled services. Other enabling factors are prepayment and risk pooling. However, private and community insurances are negatively associated with covering comprehensive maternal services, because they are subject to market failures, such as adverse and risk selection. Conclusions Emerging health financing schemes in low and upper-middle-income countries lag in coverage of maternal care. Advancing financial protection of these services in the health package needs policy attention, including government oversight and mandatory regulations. The enabling factors identified can enrich the ongoing discourse on Universal Health Coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2883708785,"Background Anhedonia (loss of pleasure) is characterized by low responsiveness to rewards and, by virtue of being one of the two core symptoms of depression, by altered responses to stress. We investigated the effect of an acute stress experience (i.e., a tandem skydive) that was expected to elicit both intense fear and intense euphoria in a sample of anhedonic young adults. Objective (1) To examine individual differences in alpha-amylase reactivity to and recovery from a tandem skydive in anhedonic young adults; (2) to investigate whether trait depressive and anxiety problems, trait positive affect (PA), i.e., level of pleasure and reward responsiveness, and state anxiety, PA and self-esteem prior to the skydive were associated with alpha-amylase reactivity and recovery patterns; (3) to investigate whether alpha-amylase reactivity and recovery patterns were associated with pre- to post-jump changes in state anxiety, PA, and self-esteem. Method Participants were 61 individuals with persistent anhedonia (Mage = 21.38, 78.7% female), who filled out a baseline questionnaire at the start of the study, and momentary questionnaires (3 times per day) before and after the tandem skydive. Alpha-amylase was measured at four time points by means of salivettes (2 before and 2 after the skydive). Results Alpha-amylase reactivity and recovery patterns were highly similar across individuals, although mean levels varied greatly. No associations were found between any of the trait and state measures and reactivity and recovery. Only state self-esteem was affected by the reactivity and recovery patterns, in that individuals who showed high reactivity and low recovery experienced decreases in self-esteem after the skydive. Conclusions Alpha-amylase patterns following a tandem skydive in anhedonic individuals are highly similar to patterns previously found in healthy individuals. Although replication is warranted, our findings tentatively suggest that a strong stress response that cannot be downregulated well predicts a decrease in self-esteem."

We assessed whether BB and HR post HTx are associated with a specific urinary proteomic signature.In 336 HTx patients (mean age, 56.8 years; 22.3% women), we analyzed cross-sectional data obtained 7.3 years (median) after HTx. We recorded medication use, measured HR during right heart catheterization, and applied capillary electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry to determine the multidimensional urinary classifiers HF1 and HF2 (known to be associated with left ventricular dysfunction), ACSP75 (acute coronary syndrome) and CKD273 (renal dysfunction) and 48 sequenced urinary peptides revealing the parental proteins.In adjusted analyses, HF1, HF2 and CKD273 (p ≤ 0.024) were higher in BB users than non-users with a similar trend for ACSP75 (p = 0.06). Patients started on BB within 1 year after HTx and non-users had similar HF1 and HF2 levels (p ≥ 0.098), whereas starting BB later was associated with higher HF1 and HF2 compared with non-users (p ≤ 0.014). There were no differences in the urinary biomarkers (p ≥ 0.27) according to HR. BB use was associated with higher urinary levels of collagen II and III fragments and non-use with higher levels of collagen I fragments.BB use, but not HR, is associated with a urinary proteomic signature that is usually associated with worse outcome, because unhealthier conditions probably lead to initiation of BB. Starting BB early after HTx surgery might be beneficial."

However, breast milk may not be sufficient to meet these needs. The possibility of supplementing breast milk with a lyophilisate of human milk was explored in this study. The objectives of this study were to determine the total lipid content and the lipid profile of the Human Milk on Baseline (HMB) and that of the Concentrates with the Human Milk + lyophilisate (with lyophilisate of milk in the immediate period (HMCI), at 3 months (HMC3m), and at 6 months (HMC6m) of storage).Fifty donors from the Human Milk Bank of Children's Hospital provided consent, and donated milk samples. Macronutrient (including total lipids) quantification was performed using the MIRIS® Human Milk Analyzer, and the fatty acid profile was determined by gas chromatography (CG-FID, SHIMADZU®).There was a higher lipid concentration in HMCI relative to HMB. The concentrations of the main fatty acids (% of total) were as follows: palmitic acid (C16:0) HMB, 22.30%; HMCI, 21.46%; HMC3m, 21.54%; and HMC6m, 21.95% (p<0.01); oleic acid (C18:1n-9) HMB, 30.41%; HMCI, 30.47%; HMC3m, 30.55%; and HMC6m, 29.79% (p = 0.46); linoleic acid (C18:2n-6) HMB, 19.62%; HMCI, 19.88%; HMC3m, 19.49%; and HMC6m, 19.45% (p = 0.58); arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6) HMB, 0.35%; HMCI, 0.16%; HMC3m, 0.13%; and HMC6m, 0.15% (p<0.01); α-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3) HMB,1.32%; HMCI, 1.37%; HMC3m, 1.34%; and 1.34% HMC6m (p = 0.14); docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3) HMB, 0.10%; HMCI, 0.06%; HMC3m, 0.05%; and HMC6m, 0.06% (p<0.01). There were no significant changes in the lipid profile when stored. There was no evidence of peroxidation during storage.Freeze-dried human milk fortified with a human milk concentrate brings potential benefits to newborns, mainly by preserving the essential nutrients present only in breast milk; however, further clinical studies are required to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the concentrate as a standard nutritional food option for very low birth weight infants."
https://openalex.org/W2951408936,"Fatty acid synthase 1 (FAS I) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an essential protein and a promising drug target. FAS I is a multi-functional, multi-domain protein that is organized as a large (1.9 MDa) homohexameric complex. Acyl intermediates produced during fatty acid elongation are attached covalently to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain. This domain is activated by the transfer of a 4'-Phosphopantetheine (4'-PP, also termed P-pant) group from CoA to ACP catalyzed by a 4'-PP transferase, termed acyl carrier protein synthase (AcpS).In order to obtain an activated FAS I in E. coli, we transformed E. coli with tagged Mtb fas1 and acpS genes encoded by a separate plasmid. We induced the expression of Mtb FAS I following induction of AcpS expression. FAS I was purified by Strep-Tactin affinity chromatography.Activation of Mtb FAS I was confirmed by the identification of a bound P-pant group on serine at position 1808 by mass spectrometry. The purified FAS I displayed biochemical activity shown by spectrophotometric analysis of NADPH oxidation and by CoA production, using the Ellman reaction. The purified Mtb FAS I forms a hexameric complex shown by negative staining and cryo-EM.Purified hexameric and active Mtb FAS I is required for binding and drug inhibition studies and for structure-function analysis of this enzyme. This relatively simple and short procedure for Mtb FAS I production should facilitate studies of this enzyme."
