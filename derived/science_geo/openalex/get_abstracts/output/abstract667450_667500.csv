https://openalex.org/W3125488134,"Identifying the relationships between chromosome structures, nuclear bodies, chromatin states and gene expression is an overarching goal of nuclear-organization studies1-4. Because individual cells appear to be highly variable at all these levels5, it is essential to map different modalities in the same cells. Here we report the imaging of 3,660 chromosomal loci in single mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells using DNA seqFISH+, along with 17 chromatin marks and subnuclear structures by sequential immunofluorescence and the expression profile of 70 RNAs. Many loci were invariably associated with immunofluorescence marks in single mouse ES cells. These loci form 'fixed points' in the nuclear organizations of single cells and often appear on the surfaces of nuclear bodies and zones defined by combinatorial chromatin marks. Furthermore, highly expressed genes appear to be pre-positioned to active nuclear zones, independent of bursting dynamics in single cells. Our analysis also uncovered several distinct mouse ES cell subpopulations with characteristic combinatorial chromatin states. Using clonal analysis, we show that the global levels of some chromatin marks, such as H3 trimethylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and macroH2A1 (mH2A1), are heritable over at least 3-4 generations, whereas other marks fluctuate on a faster time scale. This seqFISH+-based spatial multimodal approach can be used to explore nuclear organization and cell states in diverse biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W3112986012,"METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3) mediates the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation of mRNA, which affects the stability of mRNA and its translation into protein1. METTL3 also binds chromatin2–4, but the role of METTL3 and m6A methylation in chromatin is not fully understood. Here we show that METTL3 regulates mouse embryonic stem-cell heterochromatin, the integrity of which is critical for silencing retroviral elements and for mammalian development5. METTL3 predominantly localizes to the intracisternal A particle (IAP)-type family of endogenous retroviruses. Knockout of Mettl3 impairs the deposition of multiple heterochromatin marks onto METTL3-targeted IAPs, and upregulates IAP transcription, suggesting that METTL3 is important for the integrity of IAP heterochromatin. We provide further evidence that RNA transcripts derived from METTL3-bound IAPs are associated with chromatin and are m6A-methylated. These m6A-marked transcripts are bound by the m6A reader YTHDC1, which interacts with METTL3 and in turn promotes the association of METTL3 with chromatin. METTL3 also interacts physically with the histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) tri-methyltransferase SETDB1 and its cofactor TRIM28, and is important for their localization to IAPs. Our findings demonstrate that METTL3-catalysed m6A modification of RNA is important for the integrity of IAP heterochromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing a mechanism of heterochromatin regulation in mammals. Binding of METTL3 to chromatin is enriched over IAP family endogenous retroviral elements in mouse embryonic stem cells, helping to ensure the integrity of heterochromatin at these elements."
https://openalex.org/W3122837600,"Long-term climate change and periodic environmental extremes threaten food and fuel security1 and global crop productivity2-4. Although molecular and adaptive breeding strategies can buffer the effects of climatic stress and improve crop resilience5, these approaches require sufficient knowledge of the genes that underlie productivity and adaptation6-knowledge that has been limited to a small number of well-studied model systems. Here we present the assembly and annotation of the large and complex genome of the polyploid bioenergy crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). Analysis of biomass and survival among 732 resequenced genotypes, which were grown across 10 common gardens that span 1,800 km of latitude, jointly revealed extensive genomic evidence of climate adaptation. Climate-gene-biomass associations were abundant but varied considerably among deeply diverged gene pools. Furthermore, we found that gene flow accelerated climate adaptation during the postglacial colonization of northern habitats through introgression of alleles from a pre-adapted northern gene pool. The polyploid nature of switchgrass also enhanced adaptive potential through the fractionation of gene function, as there was an increased level of heritable genetic diversity on the nondominant subgenome. In addition to investigating patterns of climate adaptation, the genome resources and gene-trait associations developed here provide breeders with the necessary tools to increase switchgrass yield for the sustainable production of bioenergy."
https://openalex.org/W3124945471,"Whole-genome doubling (WGD) is common in human cancers, occurring early in tumorigenesis and generating genetically unstable tetraploid cells that fuel tumour development1,2. Cells that undergo WGD (WGD+ cells) must adapt to accommodate their abnormal tetraploid state; however, the nature of these adaptations, and whether they confer vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically, is unclear. Here, using sequencing data from roughly 10,000 primary human cancer samples and essentiality data from approximately 600 cancer cell lines, we show that WGD gives rise to common genetic traits that are accompanied by unique vulnerabilities. We reveal that WGD+ cells are more dependent than WGD- cells on signalling from the spindle-assembly checkpoint, DNA-replication factors and proteasome function. We also identify KIF18A, which encodes a mitotic kinesin protein, as being specifically required for the viability of WGD+ cells. Although KIF18A is largely dispensable for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis in WGD- cells, its loss induces notable mitotic errors in WGD+ cells, ultimately impairing cell viability. Collectively, our results suggest new strategies for specifically targeting WGD+ cancer cells while sparing the normal, non-transformed WGD- cells that comprise human tissue."
https://openalex.org/W3125673614,"Selective targeting of aneuploid cells is an attractive strategy for cancer treatment1. However, it is unclear whether aneuploidy generates any clinically relevant vulnerabilities in cancer cells. Here we mapped the aneuploidy landscapes of about 1,000 human cancer cell lines, and analysed genetic and chemical perturbation screens2-9 to identify cellular vulnerabilities associated with aneuploidy. We found that aneuploid cancer cells show increased sensitivity to genetic perturbation of core components of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which ensures the proper segregation of chromosomes during mitosis10. Unexpectedly, we also found that aneuploid cancer cells were less sensitive than diploid cells to short-term exposure to multiple SAC inhibitors. Indeed, aneuploid cancer cells became increasingly sensitive to inhibition of SAC over time. Aneuploid cells exhibited aberrant spindle geometry and dynamics, and kept dividing when the SAC was inhibited, resulting in the accumulation of mitotic defects, and in unstable and less-fit karyotypes. Therefore, although aneuploid cancer cells could overcome inhibition of SAC more readily than diploid cells, their long-term proliferation was jeopardized. We identified a specific mitotic kinesin, KIF18A, whose activity was perturbed in aneuploid cancer cells. Aneuploid cancer cells were particularly vulnerable to depletion of KIF18A, and KIF18A overexpression restored their response to SAC inhibition. Our results identify a therapeutically relevant, synthetic lethal interaction between aneuploidy and the SAC."
https://openalex.org/W3125006218,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces haemodynamic instability that threatens survival1-3, impairs neurological recovery4,5, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease6,7, and reduces quality of life8,9. Haemodynamic instability in this context is due to the interruption of supraspinal efferent commands to sympathetic circuits located in the spinal cord10, which prevents the natural baroreflex from controlling these circuits to adjust peripheral vascular resistance. Epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of the spinal cord has been shown to compensate for interrupted supraspinal commands to motor circuits below the injury11, and restored walking after paralysis12. Here, we leveraged these concepts to develop EES protocols that restored haemodynamic stability after SCI. We established a preclinical model that enabled us to dissect the topology and dynamics of the sympathetic circuits, and to understand how EES can engage these circuits. We incorporated these spatial and temporal features into stimulation protocols to conceive a clinical-grade biomimetic haemodynamic regulator that operates in a closed loop. This 'neuroprosthetic baroreflex' controlled haemodynamics for extended periods of time in rodents, non-human primates and humans, after both acute and chronic SCI. We will now conduct clinical trials to turn the neuroprosthetic baroreflex into a commonly available therapy for people with SCI."
https://openalex.org/W3121486818,"Many sequence variants have been linked to complex human traits and diseases1, but deciphering their biological functions remains challenging, as most of them reside in noncoding DNA. Here we have systematically assessed the binding of 270 human transcription factors to 95,886 noncoding variants in the human genome using an ultra-high-throughput multiplex protein–DNA binding assay, termed single-nucleotide polymorphism evaluation by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SNP-SELEX). The resulting 828 million measurements of transcription factor–DNA interactions enable estimation of the relative affinity of these transcription factors to each variant in vitro and evaluation of the current methods to predict the effects of noncoding variants on transcription factor binding. We show that the position weight matrices of most transcription factors lack sufficient predictive power, whereas the support vector machine combined with the gapped k-mer representation show much improved performance, when assessed on results from independent SNP-SELEX experiments involving a new set of 61,020 sequence variants. We report highly predictive models for 94 human transcription factors and demonstrate their utility in genome-wide association studies and understanding of the molecular pathways involved in diverse human traits and diseases. An ultra-high-throughput multiplex protein–DNA binding assay is used to assess binding of 270 human transcription factors to 95,886 noncoding variants in the human genome, providing data to improve prediction of the effects of noncoding variants on transcription factor binding and thereby increase understanding of molecular pathways involved in diverse human traits and genetic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3122549929,"The inflammasome initiates innate defence and inflammatory responses by activating caspase-1 and pyroptotic cell death in myeloid cells1,2. It consists of an innate immune receptor/sensor, pro-caspase-1, and a common adaptor molecule, ASC. Consistent with their pro-inflammatory function, caspase-1, ASC and the inflammasome component NLRP3 exacerbate autoimmunity during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by enhancing the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 in myeloid cells3-6. Here we show that the DNA-binding inflammasome receptor AIM27-10 has a T cell-intrinsic and inflammasome-independent role in the function of T regulatory (Treg) cells. AIM2 is highly expressed by both human and mouse Treg cells, is induced by TGFβ, and its promoter is occupied by transcription factors that are associated with Treg cells such as RUNX1, ETS1, BCL11B and CREB. RNA sequencing, biochemical and metabolic analyses demonstrated that AIM2 attenuates AKT phosphorylation, mTOR and MYC signalling, and glycolysis, but promotes oxidative phosphorylation of lipids in Treg cells. Mechanistically, AIM2 interacts with the RACK1-PP2A phosphatase complex to restrain AKT phosphorylation. Lineage-tracing analysis demonstrates that AIM2 promotes the stability of Treg cells during inflammation. Although AIM2 is generally accepted as an inflammasome effector in myeloid cells, our results demonstrate a T cell-intrinsic role of AIM2 in restraining autoimmunity by reducing AKT-mTOR signalling and altering immune metabolism to enhance the stability of Treg cells."
https://openalex.org/W3121945005,"Carbon is the fourth-most prevalent element in the Universe and essential for all known life. In the elemental form it is found in multiple allotropes, including graphite, diamond and fullerenes, and it has long been predicted that even more structures can exist at pressures greater than those at Earth’s core1–3. Several phases have been predicted to exist in the multi-terapascal regime, which is important for accurate modelling of the interiors of carbon-rich exoplanets4,5. By compressing solid carbon to 2 terapascals (20 million atmospheres; more than five times the pressure at Earth’s core) using ramp-shaped laser pulses and simultaneously measuring nanosecond-duration time-resolved X-ray diffraction, we found that solid carbon retains the diamond structure far beyond its regime of predicted stability. The results confirm predictions that the strength of the tetrahedral molecular orbital bonds in diamond persists under enormous pressure, resulting in large energy barriers that hinder conversion to more-stable high-pressure allotropes1,2, just as graphite formation from metastable diamond is kinetically hindered at atmospheric pressure. This work nearly doubles the highest pressure at which X-ray diffraction has been recorded on any material. X-ray diffraction measurements of solid carbon compressed to pressures of about two terapascals (approximately twenty million atmospheres) find that carbon retains a diamond structure even under these extreme conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3125492412,"The energy levels of hydrogen-like atomic systems can be calculated with great precision. Starting from their quantum mechanical solution, they have been refined over the years to include the electron spin, the relativistic and quantum field effects, and tiny energy shifts related to the complex structure of the nucleus. These energy shifts caused by the nuclear structure are vastly magnified in hydrogen-like systems formed by a negative muon and a nucleus, so spectroscopy of these muonic ions can be used to investigate the nuclear structure with high precision. Here we present the measurement of two 2S-2P transitions in the muonic helium-4 ion that yields a precise determination of the root-mean-square charge radius of the α particle of 1.67824(83) femtometres. This determination from atomic spectroscopy is in excellent agreement with the value from electron scattering1, but a factor of 4.8 more precise, providing a benchmark for few-nucleon theories, lattice quantum chromodynamics and electron scattering. This agreement also constrains several beyond-standard-model theories proposed to explain the proton-radius puzzle2-5, in line with recent determinations of the proton charge radius6-9, and establishes spectroscopy of light muonic atoms and ions as a precise tool for studies of nuclear properties."
https://openalex.org/W3124663999,"Lysosomes have fundamental physiological roles and have previously been implicated in Parkinson's disease1-5. However, how extracellular growth factors communicate with intracellular organelles to control lysosomal function is not well understood. Here we report a lysosomal K+ channel complex that is activated by growth factors and gated by protein kinase B (AKT) that we term lysoKGF. LysoKGF consists of a pore-forming protein TMEM175 and AKT: TMEM175 is opened by conformational changes in, but not the catalytic activity of, AKT. The minor allele at rs34311866, a common variant in TMEM175, is associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease and reduces channel currents. Reduction in lysoKGF function predisposes neurons to stress-induced damage and accelerates the accumulation of pathological α-synuclein. By contrast, the minor allele at rs3488217-another common variant of TMEM175, which is associated with a decreased risk of developing Parkinson's disease-produces a gain-of-function in lysoKGF during cell starvation, and enables neuronal resistance to damage. Deficiency in TMEM175 leads to a loss of dopaminergic neurons and impairment in motor function in mice, and a TMEM175 loss-of-function variant is nominally associated with accelerated rates of cognitive and motor decline in humans with Parkinson's disease. Together, our studies uncover a pathway by which extracellular growth factors regulate intracellular organelle function, and establish a targetable mechanism by which common variants of TMEM175 confer risk for Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W3124364529,"Human social behaviour crucially depends on our ability to reason about others. This capacity for theory of mind has a vital role in social cognition because it enables us not only to form a detailed understanding of the hidden thoughts and beliefs of other individuals but also to understand that they may differ from our own1-3. Although a number of areas in the human brain have been linked to social reasoning4,5 and its disruption across a variety of psychosocial disorders6-8, the basic cellular mechanisms that underlie human theory of mind remain undefined. Here, using recordings from single cells in the human dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, we identify neurons that reliably encode information about others' beliefs across richly varying scenarios and that distinguish self- from other-belief-related representations. By further following their encoding dynamics, we show how these cells represent the contents of the others' beliefs and accurately predict whether they are true or false. We also show how they track inferred beliefs from another's specific perspective and how their activities relate to behavioural performance. Together, these findings reveal a detailed cellular process in the human dorsomedial prefrontal cortex for representing another's beliefs and identify candidate neurons that could support theory of mind."

https://openalex.org/W3121520092,"Background The disease from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been considered as an international concern and a pandemic starting from the declaration of the World Health Organization (WHO) as an outbreak disease. Objective The objective of this study is to assess the prevention of knowledge and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic among the residents of Ethiopia. Methods An online cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample of Ethiopian residents via social platforms of the author’s network with popular social media such as Facebook, Telegram, and email. The snowball sampling was employed to recruit participants. In doing so, we collected the responses of 341 participants successfully from April 15 to 22, 2020. The collected data were analyzed by STATA version 14 software and descriptive statistics were employed to summarize the knowledge and practices of the community towards the COVID-19 pandemic. Results The majority of respondents 80.5% were male. About 91.2% of the participants heard about the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, out of 341 participants 90.0%, 93.8% of them knew that the COVID-19 pandemic was prevented by maintaining social distance and frequent handwashing, respectively. This shows that the prevention knowledge of the participants towards the COVID-19 by maintaining social distance and frequent handwashing was high. However, out of 341 participants only 61%,84% of them practiced social distance and frequent handwashing toward COVID-19, respectively. Conclusions The majority of the participants knew the ways to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), but there was a great problem of changing this prevention knowledge to practices. This shows that there is an action gap between having prevention knowledge of the COVID-19 and implementing it into practices to tackle the spread of the COVID-19 among communities. Therefore, the concerned body should be focused on providing awareness and education for the community regarding the implementation of prevention knowledge to practices."
https://openalex.org/W3123113411,"Modelling the spread of coronavirus globally while learning trends at global and country levels remains crucial for tackling the pandemic. We introduce a novel variational-LSTM Autoencoder model to predict the spread of coronavirus for each country across the globe. This deep Spatio-temporal model does not only rely on historical data of the virus spread but also includes factors related to urban characteristics represented in locational and demographic data (such as population density, urban population, and fertility rate), an index that represents the governmental measures and response amid toward mitigating the outbreak (includes 13 measures such as: 1) school closing, 2) workplace closing, 3) cancelling public events, 4) close public transport, 5) public information campaigns, 6) restrictions on internal movements, 7) international travel controls, 8) fiscal measures, 9) monetary measures, 10) emergency investment in health care, 11) investment in vaccines, 12) virus testing framework, and 13) contact tracing). In addition, the introduced method learns to generate a graph to adjust the spatial dependences among different countries while forecasting the spread. We trained two models for short and long-term forecasts. The first one is trained to output one step in future with three previous timestamps of all features across the globe, whereas the second model is trained to output 10 steps in future. Overall, the trained models show high validation for forecasting the spread for each country for short and long-term forecasts, which makes the introduce method a useful tool to assist decision and policymaking for the different corners of the globe."

https://openalex.org/W3123601689,"Neutralizing antibody function provides a foundation for the efficacy of vaccines and therapies1-3. Here, using a robust in vitro Ebola virus (EBOV) pseudo-particle infection assay and a well-defined set of solid-phase assays, we describe a wide spectrum of antibody responses in a cohort of healthy survivors of the Sierra Leone EBOV outbreak of 2013-2016. Pseudo-particle virus-neutralizing antibodies correlated with total anti-EBOV reactivity and neutralizing antibodies against live EBOV. Variant EBOV glycoproteins (1995 and 2014 strains) were similarly neutralized. During longitudinal follow-up, antibody responses fluctuated in a 'decay-stimulation-decay' pattern that suggests de novo restimulation by EBOV antigens after recovery. A pharmacodynamic model of antibody reactivity identified a decay half-life of 77-100 days and a doubling time of 46-86 days in a high proportion of survivors. The highest antibody reactivity was observed around 200 days after an individual had recovered. The model suggests that EBOV antibody reactivity declines over 0.5-2 years after recovery. In a high proportion of healthy survivors, antibody responses undergo rapid restimulation. Vigilant follow-up of survivors and possible elective de novo antigenic stimulation by vaccine immunization should be considered in order to prevent EBOV viral recrudescence in recovering individuals and thereby to mitigate the potential risk of reseeding an outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W3122743068,"The location and degree of material transfer between the upper and lower mantle are key to the Earth's thermal and chemical evolution. Sinking slabs and rising plumes are generally accepted as locations of transfer1,2, whereas mid-ocean ridges are not typically assumed to have a role3. However, tight constraints from in situ measurements at ridges have proved to be challenging. Here we use receiver functions that reveal the conversion of primary to secondary seismic waves to image the discontinuities that bound the mantle transition zone, using ocean bottom seismic data from the equatorial Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Our images show that the seismic discontinuity at depths of about 660 kilometres is broadly uplifted by 10 ± 4 kilometres over a swath about 600 kilometres wide and that the 410-kilometre discontinuity is depressed by 5 ± 4 kilometres. This thinning of the mantle transition zone is coincident with slow shear-wave velocities in the mantle, from global seismic tomography4-7. In addition, seismic velocities in the mantle transition zone beneath the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are on average slower than those beneath older Atlantic Ocean seafloor. The observations imply material transfer from the lower to the upper mantle-either continuous or punctuated-that is linked to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Given the length and longevity of the mid-ocean ridge system, this implies that whole-mantle convection may be more prevalent than previously thought, with ridge upwellings having a role in counterbalancing slab downwellings."
https://openalex.org/W3125996263,"The intestinal environment is unique because it supports the intestinal epithelial cells under a normal oxygen environment and the microbiota under an anoxic environment. Due to importance of understanding the interactions between the epithelium and the microbiota, there is a strong need for developing representative and simple experimental models. Current approaches do not capture the partitioned oxygen environment, require external anaerobic chambers, or are complex. Another major limitation is that with the solutions that can mimic this oxygen environment, the oxygenation level of the epithelial cells is not known, raising the question whether the cells are hypoxic or not. We report standalone microfluidic devices that form a partitioned oxygen environment without the use of an external anaerobic chamber or oxygen scavengers to coculture intestinal epithelial and bacterial cells. By changing the thickness of the device cover, the oxygen tension in the chamber was modulated. We verified the oxygen levels using several tests: microscale oxygen sensitive sensors which were integrated within the devices, immunostaining of Caco-2 cells to determine hypoxia levels, and genetically encoded bacteria to visualize the growth. Collectively, these methods monitored oxygen concentrations in the devices more comprehensively than previous reports and allowed for control of oxygen tension to match the requirements of both intestinal cells and anaerobic bacteria. Our experimental model is supported by the mathematical model that considered diffusion of oxygen into the top chamber. This allowed us to experimentally determine the oxygen consumption rate of the intestinal epithelial cells under perfusion."
https://openalex.org/W3123162408,"Photosynthesis—both oxygenic and more ancient anoxygenic forms—has fueled the bulk of primary productivity on Earth since it first evolved more than 3.4 billion years ago. However, the early evolutionary history of photosynthesis has been challenging to interpret due to the sparse, scattered distribution of metabolic pathways associated with photosynthesis, long timescales of evolution, and poor sampling of the true environmental diversity of photosynthetic bacteria. Here, we reconsider longstanding hypotheses for the evolutionary history of phototrophy by leveraging recent advances in metagenomic sequencing and phylogenetics to analyze relationships among phototrophic organisms and components of their photosynthesis pathways, including reaction centers and individual proteins and complexes involved in the multi-step synthesis of (bacterio)-chlorophyll pigments. We demonstrate that components of the photosynthetic apparatus have undergone extensive, independent histories of horizontal gene transfer. This suggests an evolutionary mode by which modular components of phototrophy are exchanged between diverse taxa in a piecemeal process that has led to biochemical innovation. We hypothesize that the evolution of extant anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria has been spurred by ecological competition and restricted niches following the evolution of oxygenic Cyanobacteria and the accumulation of O 2 in the atmosphere, leading to the relatively late evolution of bacteriochlorophyll pigments and the radiation of diverse crown group anoxygenic phototrophs. This hypothesis expands on the classic “Granick hypothesis” for the stepwise evolution of biochemical pathways, synthesizing recent expansion in our understanding of the diversity of phototrophic organisms as well as their evolving ecological context through Earth history."
https://openalex.org/W3124306207,"Background Drug-resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex remains a major health burden in human history and still is a major leading cause of death in developing countries including Ethiopia. Early detection of all forms of drug-resistant Tuberculosis(TB) is a key factor to reduce and contain the spread of these resistant strains. Methods A health facility-based cross-sectional study was employed, based on demographic, clinical, and laboratory data collected from 204 patients with bacteriological confirmed TB. Sputum samples were analyzed using conventional TB culture and identification test followed by molecular species identification, and then phenotypic drug susceptibility tests. Data were entered using an excel spreadsheet and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Descriptive analysis; frequencies, and proportions were computed. Results Among the 204 sputum samples inoculated in culture media, Mycobacterium species were recovered from 165 specimens, with 160 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and five Non- Tuberculosis Mycobacterium(NTM) species. All Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was found to be M . tuberculosis . Of the five NTM species, 2 M . fortuitum , 2 M . intracellulare , and 1 M . gordonae were identified. Among 160 species of M . tuberculosis isolates, 110(68.8%) were resistant to any of the anti-TB drugs. The resistance pattern was; INH (109, 68.1%), RIF (99, 61.9%), STM (73,45.6%), and EMB (32,20.0%). Mono-resistance was found for INH (7,4.3%) and STM (1,0.6%). Ninety-nine (61.9%) isolates become MDR, while resistance to any of the second-line anti-TB drugs was detected in 9 (5.6%) strains, with 8(5%) Pre-XDR and one (0.6%) XDR cases. Conclusion Our findings highlight high frequencies of drug resistance to first and second-line anti-TB drugs.Determining the drug-resistance pattern of MTB is important for programmatic management of drug-resistant TB in Ethiopia. The circulating Pre-XDR and XDR case identified in the current study is alarming to the tuberculosis control program in the country."
https://openalex.org/W3125735641,"Background During the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., African-American or Hispanic communities were disproportionately impacted. To better understand the epidemiology and relative effects of COVID-19 among hospitalized Hispanic patients, we compared individual and census-tract level characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to those diagnosed with influenza, another viral infection with respiratory transmission. We evaluated temporal changes in epidemiology related to a shelter-in-place mandate. Methods We evaluated patients hospitalized at Cook County Health, the safety-net health system for the Chicago metropolitan area. Among self-identified hospitalized Hispanic patients, we compared those with influenza (2019–2020 season) to COVID-19 infection during March 16, 2020-May 11, 2020. We used multivariable analysis to identify differences in individual and census-tract level characteristics between the two groups. Results Relative to non-Hispanic blacks and whites, COVID-19 rapidly increased among Hispanics during promotion of social-distancing policies. Whereas non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to be hospitalized for influenza, Hispanic patients predominated among COVID-19 infections (40% relative increase compared to influenza). In the comparative analysis of influenza and COVID-19, Hispanic patients with COVID-19 were more likely to reside in census tracts with higher proportions of residents with the following characteristics: Hispanic; no high school diploma; non-US citizen; limited English speaking ability; employed in manufacturing or construction; and overcrowding. By multivariable analysis, Hispanic patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to those with influenza were more likely to be male (adjusted OR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.9), obese (aOR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.5 to 4.2), or reside in a census tract with ≥40% of residents without a high-school diploma (aOR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.3 to 4.8). Conclusions The rapid and disproportionate increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations among Hispanics after the shelter-in-place mandate indicates that public health strategies were inadequate in protecting this population—in particular, for those residing in neighborhoods with lower levels of educational attainment."
https://openalex.org/W3124551314,"Background At time of discharge after a pneumonia admission, care planning for older persons with dementia is essential. However, care planning is limited by lack of knowledge on the short-term prognosis. Aim To investigate 30-day mortality and readmission after hospital discharge for pneumonia in persons with versus without dementia, and to investigate how these associations vary with age, time since discharge, and medication use. Methods Using the Danish registries, we investigated 30-day mortality and readmission in persons (+65 years) discharged after pneumonia in 2000–2016 (N = 298,872). Adjusted mortality rate ratios (aMRRs) and incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) were calculated for persons with versus without dementia, and we investigated if these associations varied with use of benzodiazepines, opioids, and antipsychotics, and with age and time since discharge. Results Among 25,948 persons with dementia, 4,524 died and 5,694 were readmitted within 30 days. The risk of 30-day mortality was 129% higher (95% CI 2.21–2.37) in persons with versus without dementia after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, admission-related factors, and comorbidities. Further, the highest mortality risk was found in persons with both dementia and use of antipsychotics (aMRR: 3.39, 95% CI 3.19–3.59); 16% of deaths in this group could not be explained by the independent effect of each exposure. In those with dementia, the highest aMRRs were found for the youngest and for the first days after discharge. The risk of 30-day readmission was 7% higher (95% CI 1.04–1.10) in persons with versus without dementia. In those with dementia, the highest aIRRs were found for the first days after discharge. Conclusions Dementia was associated with higher short-term mortality after pneumonia, especially in users of antipsychotics, and with slightly higher readmission, especially in the first days after discharge. This is essential knowledge in the care planning for persons with dementia who are discharged after a pneumonia admission."

We will focus on traditional, small, extensive pig and poultry farms where information on antibiotic use is scarce and animals live in close contact with humans. This cross-sectional study will be based on the epidemiological analysis of the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) present in fecal samples from animals and humans. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) and Enterobacteriaceae resistant to colistin will be actively searched in the feces of farm animals (pigs and poultry), small wild rodents and farmers. Phenotypic (selective plating) and genotypic (multilocus seuquence typing and sequencing) methods will be used for the detection of AMR, the identification of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and the characterization of strains carrying resistance genes. Questionnaires will be administered to investigate the effects of antibiotic use, farm characteristics and biosecurity measures on the occurrence of AMR in animals. Subsequently, the fecal carriage of AMR and ARGs in farmers will be compared to a control population with no occupational contacts with animals, thus enabling an estimation of the risk of transmission of AMR/ARGs from animals to farmers."

A very high sensitivity and accuracy of the new method for detecting gene polymorphism as a great alternative to classical MLST has been demonstrated. The analysis of GB-speckles , obtained for the concatenated sequences of seven genes ( gatA , gidA , enoA , fumC , hemN , hflX , oppA ) of three different Chlamydia trachomatis strains (E/Bour, ST94; G/9301, ST95; G/11222, ST94) has been applied as the model. The high efficiency of usage of s- LASCA -imaging of GB-speckles has been shown. The data obtained represent a significant progress in digital biology as a whole and improvements in the bio-digitalization of bacterial DNA."
https://openalex.org/W3123000185,"Focal tumor ablation with ethanol could provide benefits in low-resource settings because of its low overall cost, minimal imaging technology requirements, and acceptable clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, ethanol ablation is not commonly utilized because of a lack of predictability of the ablation zone, caused by inefficient retention of ethanol at the injection site. To create a predictable zone of ablation, we have developed a polymer-assisted ablation method using ethyl cellulose (EC) mixed with ethanol. EC is ethanol-soluble and water-insoluble, allowing for EC-ethanol to be injected as a liquid and precipitate into a solid, occluding the leakage of ethanol upon contact with tissue. The aims of this study were to compare the 1) safety, 2) release kinetics, 3) spatial distribution, 4) necrotic volume, and 5) overall survival of EC-ethanol to conventional ethanol ablation in a murine breast tumor model. Non-target tissue damage was monitored through localized adverse events recording, ethanol release kinetics with Raman spectroscopy, injectate distribution with in vivo imaging, target-tissue necrosis with NADH-diaphorase staining, and overall survival by proxy of tumor growth. EC-ethanol exhibited decreased localized adverse events, a slowing of the release rate of ethanol, more compact injection zones, 5-fold increase in target-tissue necrosis, and longer overall survival rates compared to the same volume of pure ethanol. A single 150 μL dose of 6% EC-ethanol achieved a similar survival probability rates to six daily 50 μL doses of pure ethanol used to simulate a slow-release of ethanol over 6 days. Taken together, these results demonstrate that EC-ethanol is safer and more effective than ethanol alone for ablating tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3121784636,"This study aimed to find the prognostic value of Beta-lactamase-like (LACTB) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) patients. The mRNA expression of LACTB was upregulated in PAAD and was correlated with vital status (P = 0.0199). The immunoreactive scores of LACTB protein in human PAAD tissues were significantly higher than those in adjacent noncancerous pancreatic tissues. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve assessment showed that LACTB mRNA expression has high diagnostic value in PAAD. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox analyses suggested that patients with high LACTB mRNA expression have a poor prognosis, indicating that LACTB mRNA is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.72, P = 0.015, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.106–2.253] and disease-specific survival (HR = 1.97, P = 0.004, 95% CI = 1.238–3.152) of PAAD patients. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that hallmark_g2m_checkpoint, hallmark_myc_targets_v1, hallmark_e2f_targets, and kegg_cell_cycle were differentially enriched in phenotypes with high LACTB expression. In addition, CDC20, CDK4, MCM6, MAD2L1, MCM2 and MCM5 were leading genes intersecting in these four pathways, and a positive correlation between mRNA expression and LACTB was observed in most normal and cancer tissues. Finally, elevated LACTB mRNA expression was significantly related to multiple immune marker sets. Our results elucidate that LACTB is involved in the development of cancer, and that high LACTB expression in patients with PAAD can predict a poor prognosis. High LACTB expression was significantly correlated with cell cycle-related genes and multiple immune marker sets."

Similarity model experiments, numerical simulations and theoretical calculations are used to quantitatively study the pressure relief protection effect of different strip widths, dip angles and coal pillar widths of a thin underside protective seam under deeply buried conditions. The optimal strip width range is obtained according to the change law of strain during the mining process of the underside protective seam in a similar model experiment. The change law of the expansion of the protected coal seam is obtained and the fitting surfaces among the dip angle and strip width of the coal seam with the protection distance and pressure relief angle along the strike and dip of the protected coal seam are established according to the numerical simulation results of underside protective seam mining. It is concluded that the best pressure relief effect can be achieved when the dip angle is 16.7° and the strip width is 70 m. According to the stability threshold of coal pillars considered in strip mining theory, the coal pillar width is calculated to be 50 m. Similarity model experiments and numerical simulations of protected coal seam mining verify the pressure relief effect of the designed protective seam strip width and pillar width. A calculation method of the protective seam strip width, position and pillar width required by the specific width of the protected seam is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W3122836863,"Introduction International migration is increasing rapidly around the world mostly to obtain a job. International migrant workers usually leave their children back in their country of origin, and among family members, adolescents may experience greater psychological distress from parental separation. However, limited evidence is available on the relationship between parental international migration and psychological well-being of left-behind adolescents. Nepal has a relatively higher and increasing number of international migrants, and this study was conducted to examine the association between parental international migration and the psychological well-being of left-behind adolescents in Nepal. Methods A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 626 adolescents in two districts of Western Nepal, where international migration is common. Adolescents were recruited through random sampling. Pre-tested “Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire” was used to measure their psychological well-being and simple and multiple linear regression were used to examine the association between parental international migration and the psychological well-being of left-behind adolescents. Results Adolescents with none of the parents living abroad were more likely to have higher total difficulties score compared to those with one of the parents living abroad (B: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.18, 1.86; p = 0.017). Adolescents with the following factors were more likely to have higher total difficulties score in comparison to their counterparts: adolescents in their late adolescence period, female adolescents, adolescents from ethnicities other than Brahmin and adolescents studying in private schools. Conclusion In rural districts of Nepal, where international migration is common, adolescents living with the parents were more likely to have poorer psychological well-being compared to those with one of the parents living abroad. Adolescents’ adaptation mechanism for the absence of parents for international migration might be explored in the future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3124749251,"Tissue mechanics is central to pregnancy, during which maternal anatomic structures undergo continuous remodeling to serve a dual function to first protect the fetus in utero while it develops and then facilitate its passage out. In this study of normal pregnancy using biomechanical solid modeling, we used standard clinical ultrasound images to obtain measurements of structural dimensions of the gravid uterus and cervix throughout gestation. 2-dimensional ultrasound images were acquired from the uterus and cervix in 30 pregnant subjects in supine and standing positions at four time points during pregnancy (8-14, 14-16, 22-24, and 32-34 weeks). Offline, three observers independently measured from the images of multiple anatomic regions. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate inter-observer variance, as well as effect of gestational age, gravity, and parity on maternal geometry. A parametric solid model developed in the Solidworks computer aided design (CAD) software was used to convert ultrasonic measurements to a 3-dimensional solid computer model, from which estimates of uterine and cervical volumes were made. This parametric model was compared against previous 3-dimensional solid models derived from magnetic resonance frequency images in pregnancy. In brief, we found several anatomic measurements easily derived from standard clinical imaging are reproducible and reliable, and provide sufficient information to allow biomechanical solid modeling. This structural dataset is the first, to our knowledge, to provide key variables to enable future computational calculations of tissue stress and stretch in pregnancy, making it possible to characterize the biomechanical milieu of normal pregnancy. This vital dataset will be the foundation to understand how the uterus and cervix malfunction in pregnancy leading to adverse perinatal outcomes."

This phenomenon is characterized by heavy rains and floods that negatively affect the economic activities of the impacted areas. Understanding how this phenomenon influences consumption behavior at different granularity levels is essential for recommending strategies to normalize the situation. With this aim, we performed a multi-scale analysis of data associated with bank transactions involving credit and debit cards. Our findings can be summarized into two main results: Coarse-grained analysis reveals the presence of the El Ni\~no phenomenon and the recovery time in a given territory, while fine-grained analysis demonstrates a change in individuals' purchasing patterns and in merchant relevance as a consequence of the climatic event. The results also indicate that society successfully withstood the natural disaster owing to the economic structure built over time.

https://openalex.org/W3121492288,"Objective Determine whether items in a cataract surgery appropriateness and prioritization questionnaire can predict change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and health related quality of life (HRQOL) following cataract surgery. Methods 313 patients with a cataract in Ontario, Canada were recruited to participate. BCVA was measured using the Snellen chart. HRQOL was measured using a generic instrument (EQ5D), a visual functioning instrument (Catquest-9SF), and an appropriateness and prioritization instrument (17 items). Outcomes were measured preoperatively and 3–6 months postoperatively. Descriptive statistics were used to describe demographics and outcomes. For each appropriateness and prioritization questionnaire item, a one-way ANOVA was used to compare group means of the change in BCVA, EQ5D, and Catquest-9SF. Results Participants had a mean age of 69 years and were 56% female. BCVA improved in 81%, EQ5D in 49.6%, and Catquest-9SF score in 84% of patients. Improvement in both BCVA and Catquest-9SF scores were found in 68.5% of patients. The ANOVA showed a statistically significant association between a change in BCVA and the ability to participate in social life, and a statistically significant association between a change in Catquest-9SF and glare, extent of impairment in visual function, safety and injury concerns, ability to work and care for dependents, ability to take care of local errands, ability to assist others and ability to participate in social life. Conclusions Almost all patients had improved BCVA and/or visual functioning after surgery. Seven variables from the cataract appropriateness and prioritization instrument were found to be predictors of improvement in Catquest-9SF measuring visual functioning."
https://openalex.org/W3121994860,"A new bycatch reduction device, termed “Excluder”, is presented as an alternative to a traditional rigid sorting grid, mandatory in the small-meshed Norway Pout ( Trisopterus esmarkii ) trawl fishery in the North Sea. The fishery is a high-volume fishery with large vessels, large demersal trawls and catches up to 100 tons per haul of this small forage fish. The Excluder is a 30 m long netting-based sorting system, developed to reduce bycatch (70 mm square meshes) and improving on board gear-handling and safety. The Excluder was tested against a 5.8 m 2 standard sorting grid (35 mm bar spacing) in a twin-trawl experiment from the commercial 70 m trawler “S364 Rockall”. Catch data were analysed by species and length using the catch comparison method. For all bycatch species analysed, the Excluder had significantly lower catches relative to the grid: herring (21%), whiting (6%), mackerel (5%), American plaice (70%), witch flounder (15%), and lesser silver smelt (71%). For Norway Pout there was a significant increase in the overall catch efficiency of 32%. These results are explained by a 10 cm smaller L50 (the length of fish with 50% probability of being rejected by the sorting system) of the Excluder and a 15 times larger sorting area, which reduces the risk of clogging and loss of function. With these documented effects of improved sorting and target species catch efficiency, implementation of the Excluder would improve sustainability and address two main barriers of the current Norway pout fishery that limit quota capitalization; a tendency for Norway pout to mix with herring and whiting and lowered catch rates from grid-clogging. Additionally, gear-handling and safety on board would be improved."
https://openalex.org/W3125890101,"In low-and middle-income countries, determining the cause of death of any given individual is impaired by poor access to healthcare systems, resource-poor diagnostic facilities, and limited acceptance of complete diagnostic autopsies. Minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS), an innovative post-mortem procedure based on obtaining tissue specimens using fine needle biopsies suitable for laboratory analysis, is an acceptable proxy of the complete diagnostic autopsy, and thus could reduce the uncertainty of cause of death. This study describes rumor surveillance activities developed and implemented in Bangladesh, Mali, and Mozambique to identify, track and understand rumors about the MITS procedure. Our surveillance activities included observations and interviews with stakeholders to understand how rumors are developed and spread and to anticipate rumors in the program areas. We also engaged young volunteers, local stakeholders, community leaders, and study staff to report rumors being spread in the community after MITS launch. Through community meetings, we also managed and responded to rumors. When a rumor was reported, the field team purposively conducted interviews and group discussions to track, verify and understand the rumor. From July 2016 through April 2018, the surveillance identified several rumors including suspicions of organs being harvested or transplanted; MITS having been performed on a living child, and concerns related to disrespecting the body and mistrust related to the study purpose. These rumors, concerns, and cues of mistrust were passed by word of mouth. We managed the rumors by modifying the consent protocol and giving additional information and support to the bereaved family and to the community members. Rumor surveillance was critical for anticipating and readily identifying rumors and managing them. Setting up rumor surveillance by engaging community residents, stakeholders, and volunteers could be an essential part of any public health program where there is a need to identify and react in real-time to public concern."
https://openalex.org/W3121232025,"A key factor to take actions against phytosanitary problems is the accurate and rapid detection of the causal agent. Here, we develop a molecular diagnostics system based on comparative genomics to easily identify fusariosis and specific pathogenic species as the Fusarium kuroshium , the symbiont of the ambrosia beetle Euwallaceae kuroshio Gomez and Hulcr which is responsible for Fusarium dieback disease in San Diego CA, USA. We performed a pan-genome analysis using sixty-three ascomycetes fungi species including phytopathogens and fungi associated with the ambrosia beetles. Pan-genome analysis revealed that 2,631 orthologue genes are only shared by Fusarium spp., and on average 3,941 (SD ± 1,418.6) are species-specific genes. These genes were used for PCR primer design and tested on DNA isolated from i) different strains of ascomycete species, ii) artificially infected avocado stems and iii) plant tissue of field-collected samples presumably infected. Our results let us propose a useful set of primers to either identify any species from Fusarium genus or, in a specific manner, species such as F . kuroshium , F . oxysporum , and F . graminearum . The results suggest that the molecular strategy employed in this study can be expanded to design primers against different types of pathogens responsible for provoking critical plant diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3121275702,"Introduction Evidence suggests that the expression of certain cytokine receptors increases with lung cancer evolution. Overexpression of the cytokine receptor CXCR4 is associated with poor outcomes in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with shorter survival in females with high CXCR4 expression. This study quantifies CXCR4 expression in early stage disease and evaluates its association with gender-specific recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in resected stage I-III NSCLC patients. Methods Patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were obtained from the Glans-Look Lung Cancer (G-LLC) database for early stage NSCLC patients diagnosed between 2003–2006 at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre (TBCC). CXCR4 expression was quantified on tissue microarrays (TMA). Median RFS and OS were evaluated by gender using Kaplan-Meier analyses. CXCR4 expression and outcome data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards (PH) and multi-state models (MSM). Results 176 stage I-III NSCLC patients were identified. CXCR4 expression was lower in early stage NSCLC patients, with a mean CXCR4 expression of 1729 (SD 1083) compared to 2640 (SD 1541) in stage IV patients. On Kaplan-Meier, median RFS by gender was similar (male 52.8 months vs. female 54.5 months) as was median OS (male 80.9 months vs. female 89.0 months), and there was no significant difference in RFS (p = 0.60) or OS (p = 0.30) by gender and CXCR4 groups over follow-up. By multivariable analysis, CXCR4 expression was not prognostic for RFS (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.00, p = 0.73) or OS (HR = 1.00, p = 0.44), and no gender difference was observed. Conclusions CXCR4 expression increases with stage progression in NSCLC but is not prognostic in early stage NSCLC patients of either gender. Mechanisms by which CXCR4 expression increases during lung carcinogenesis warrant further exploration and testing in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3121881026,"As the industry gradually enters the stage of unmanned and intelligent, factories in the future need to realize intelligent monitoring and diagnosis and maintenance of parts and components. In order to achieve this goal, it is first necessary to accurately identify and classify the parts in the factory. However, the existing literature rarely studies the classification and identification of parts of the entire factory. Due to the lack of existing data samples, this paper studies the identification and classification of small samples of industrial machine parts. In order to solve this problem, this paper establishes a convolutional neural network model based on the InceptionNet-V3 pretrained model through migration learning. Through experimental design, the influence of data expansion, learning rate and optimizer algorithm on the model effectiveness is studied, and the optimal model was finally determined, and the test accuracy rate reaches 99.74%. By comparing with the accuracy of other classifiers, the experimental results prove that the convolutional neural network model based on transfer learning can effectively solve the problem of recognition and classification of industrial machine parts with small samples and the idea of transfer learning can also be further promoted."
https://openalex.org/W3123328501,"Postmortem muscle temperature affects the rate of pH decline in a linear manner from 37.5°C to 0–2°C. The pH decline is correlated with the enzymatic degradation of glycogen to lactate and this process includes the metabolic coupling between glycogenolysis and glycolysis, and that are strongly upregulated by the AMPK. In this study, we used 12 samples previously characterized by have different muscle glycogen concentration, lactate and AMPK activity, selected from 38 steers that produced high final pH (&gt;5.9) and normal final pH (&lt;5.8) carcasses at 24 h postmortem. Moreover, we evaluated changes in the AMPK activity in samples from both categories incubated at 37, 25, 17 and 5°C and supplemented with exogenous glycogen. Finally, we analysed if there were structural differences between polymers from both categories. Our results showed that “in vitro” enzymatic AMPK activity evaluated at both 0.5 or 24 h was greater in samples from normal then high pH categories (p &lt;0.01), and in all temperature of incubation analysed (17, 25 and 37°C). For other hand, a greater AMPK activity were obtained in samples incubated at 17 that 25 or 37°C, in normal carcasses at both 0.5 or 24 h (p &lt; 0.01), as also in samples from carcasses categorized as high pH, but at 24 h (p &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, AMPK activity was totally abolished at 5°C, independent of final pH category of carcasses, and was confirmed that the incubation temperature at which the maximum activity was obtained (p &lt; 0.01), at least in carcasses with a normal pH is at 17°C. The enzymatic AMPK activity did not change in relation to excess glycogen (p &gt; 0.05) and we did not detect structural differences in the polymers present in samples from both categories (p &gt; 0.05), suggesting that postmortem AMPK activity may be highly sensitive to temperature and not to in vitro changes in glycogen concentration (p &gt; 0.05). Our results allow concluding that normal concentrations of muscle glycogen immediately at the time of slaughter (0.5 h) and an adequate cooling managing of carcasses are relevant to let an efficient glycogenolytic/glycolytic flow required for lactate accumulation and pH decline, through the postmortem AMPK signalling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3124805964,"This study was performed to investigate the role of dysglycemia on the genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) among pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients to build scientific evidence about the possible mechanisms of TB transmission. MTB isolates obtained of patients affected by pulmonary tuberculosis from health care facilities of North Lima—Peru, were analyzed using whole genome sequencing and 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit -variable-number tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR). Subsequently, clinical and epidemiological characteristics were associated with clustering, lineages and comorbid conditions. The analysis carried out 112 pulmonary TB patients from various health centers in North Lima, 17 (15%) had diabetes mellitus (DM) and 33 (29%) had pre-diabetes (PDM). Latin American-Mediterranean, Haarlem and Beijing were the most frequent MTB lineages found in those patients. Previous TB (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.65; 95%CI: 1.32–17.81), age (aOR = 1.12; 95%CI: 1.03–1.45) and Beijing lineage (aOR = 3.53; 95%CI: 1.08–13.2) were associated with TB-DM comorbidity. Alcoholism (aOR = 2.92; 95%CI: 1.10–8.28), age (aOR = 1.05; 95%CI: 1.03–1.12) and Haarlem lineage (aOR = 2.54; 95%CI: 1.04–6.51) were associated with TB-PDM comorbidity. Beijing and Haarlem lineages were independently associated with TB-DM and TB-PDM comorbidities, respectively. Although these findings may be surprising, we must be cautious to suggest that dysglycemia could be associated with a highly clustering and predisposition of MTB lineages related to a serious impact on the severity of TB disease, which requires further research."
https://openalex.org/W3125244420,"Following an outbreak of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections in Thailand in 2019, numerous cases of CHIKV infection have been diagnosed in Bangkok, the capital of the country. In our previous investigation of the vectors for disease transmission, we found natural infection of CHIKV in both male and female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected from the outbreak areas in Bangkok. Some reports mentioned the detection of CHIKV in Culex mosquitoes. In Thailand, the Culex quinquefasciatus Say mosquito is a common species found in urban and rural settings that coexists with Ae . aegypti . However, the role of Cx . quinquefasciatus mosquitoes in the spread of the Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL) of CHIKV in Thailand has never been investigated. In this study, Cx . quinquefasciatus were collected (16 males and 27 females) from an outbreak area in Bangkok. Eight of the 27 in field-caught female Cx . quinquefasciatus were positive for IOL CHIKV RNA, and 99–100% identity and full 100% coverage of sequences similar to CHIKV isolated from female Ae . aegypti in Bangkok, Thailand, whereas viral RNA was not detected in male samples using nested-RT-PCR. To determine whether CHIKV is able to replicate in Cx . quinquefasciatus , the laboratory strain of Cx . quinquefasciatus was allowed to feed on blood containing IOL CHIKV isolated from patient serum. The nested-RT-PCR, virus isolation, and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were performed for CHIKV detection and replication. The results showed that CHIKV RNA was detected in Cx . quinquefasciatus until day 4 post infection. CHIKV did not produce any remarkable signs of infection, dissemination, or transmission in Cx . quinquefasciatus , and cytopathic effect (CPE) was not observed in C6/36 cells when infected with supernatant obtained from Cx . quinquefasciatus at days 7, 10, 14, and 21 post infection when compared to Ae . aegypti . The data from this study infer that CHIKV may be detected in Cx . quinquefasciatus but that the mosquito is not able to transmit CHIKV in Thailand."

We also find that village leaders with high walk-betweenness are more likely to accelerate the rate of microfinance take-up among their followers, outperforming other traditional centrality measures in regression analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3123338246,"The Buridan’s paradigm is a behavioral task designed for testing visuomotor responses or phototaxis in fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster . In the task, a wing-shortened fruit fly freely moves on a round platform surrounded by a 360° white screen with two vertical black stripes placed at 0° and 180°. A normal fly will tend to approach the stripes one at a time and move back and forth between them. A variety of tasks developed based on the Buridan’s paradigm were designed to test other cognitive functions such as visual spatial memory. Although the movement patterns and the behavioral preferences of the flies in the Buridan’s or similar tasks have been extensively studies a few decades ago, the protocol and experimental settings are markedly different from what are used today. We revisited the Buridan’s paradigm and systematically investigated the approach behavior of fruit flies under different stimulus settings. While early studies revealed an edge-fixation behavior for a wide stripe in the initial visuomotor responses, we did not discover such tendency in the Buridan’s paradigm when observing a longer-term behavior up to minutes, a memory-task relevant time scale. Instead, we observed robust negative photoaxis in which the flies approached the central part of the dark stripes of all sizes. In addition, we found that stripes of 20°-30° width yielded the best performance of approach. We further varied the luminance of the stripes and the background screen, and discovered that the performance depended on the luminance ratio between the stripes and the screen. Our study provided useful information for designing and optimizing the Buridan’s paradigm and other behavioral tasks that utilize the approach behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3123398900,"Objective Standardized face-to-face interviews are widely used in low and middle-income countries to collect data for social science and health research. Such interviews can be long and tedious. In an attempt to improve the respondents’ experience of interviews, we developed a concept of gamified interview format by including a game element. Gamification is reported to increase engagement in tasks, but results from rigorously developed research are equivocal, and a theory of gamification is still needed. Materials &amp; methods We evaluated the proposed gamification with a randomized controlled trial based on self-determination theory, specifically on the basic psychological needs theory. In total, 1266 respondents were interviewed. Single and multiple mediation analyses were used to understand the effects of the gamified interview format. Results Our evaluation showed that the gamification we had developed did not improve the outcome, the experience of the interview reported by respondent. The effect of the gamified interview format depended on the ability of respondents: gamification can be counterproductive if it overburdens the respondents. However, the basic psychological needs theory explained the mechanisms of action of gamification well: feeling competent and related to others improved the reported experience of the interview. Conclusion We emphasize the need to develop context-specific gamification and invite researchers to conduct equivalently rigorous evaluations of gamification in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3123756923,"Background While malaria transmission in Africa still happens primarily inside houses, there is a substantial proportion of Anopheles mosquitoes that bite or rest outdoors. This situation may compromise the performance of indoor insecticidal interventions such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). This study investigated the distribution of malaria mosquitoes biting or resting outside dwellings in three low-altitude villages in south-eastern Tanzania. The likelihood of malaria infections outdoors was also assessed. Methods Nightly trapping was done outdoors for 12 months to collect resting mosquitoes (using resting bucket traps) and host-seeking mosquitoes (using odour-baited Suna® traps). The mosquitoes were sorted by species and physiological states. Pooled samples of Anopheles were tested to estimate proportions infected with Plasmodium falciparum parasites, estimate proportions carrying human blood as opposed to other vertebrate blood and identify sibling species in the Anopheles gambiae complex and An . funestus group. Environmental and anthropogenic factors were observed and recorded within 100 meters from each trapping positions. Generalised additive models were used to investigate relationships between these variables and vector densities, produce predictive maps of expected abundance and compare outcomes within and between villages. Results A high degree of fine-scale heterogeneity in Anopheles densities was observed between and within villages. Water bodies covered with vegetation were associated with 22% higher densities of An . arabiensis and 51% lower densities of An . funestus . Increasing densities of houses and people outdoors were both associated with reduced densities of An . arabiensis and An . funestus . Vector densities were highest around the end of the rainy season and beginning of the dry seasons. More than half (14) 58.3% of blood-fed An . arabiensis had bovine blood, (6) 25% had human blood. None of the Anopheles mosquitoes caught outdoors was found infected with malaria parasites. Conclusion Outdoor densities of both host-seeking and resting Anopheles mosquitoes had significant heterogeneities between and within villages, and were influenced by multiple environmental and anthropogenic factors. Despite the high Anopheles densities outside dwellings, the substantial proportion of non-human blood-meals and absence of malaria-infected mosquitoes after 12 months of nightly trapping suggests very low-levels of outdoor malaria transmission in these villages."
https://openalex.org/W3122165508,"After an epidemic outbreak, the infection persists in a community long enough to engulf the entire susceptible population. Local extinction of the disease could be possible if the susceptible population gets depleted. In large communities, the tendency of eventual damp down of recurrent epidemics is balanced by random variability. But, in small communities, the infection would die out when the number of susceptible falls below a certain threshold. Critical community size (CCS) is considered to be the mentioned threshold, at which the infection is as likely as not to die out after a major epidemic for small communities unless reintroduced from outside. The determination of CCS could aid in devising systematic control strategies to eradicate the infectious disease from small communities. In this article, we have come up with a simplified computation based approach to deduce the CCS of HIV disease dynamics. We consider a deterministic HIV model proposed by Silva and Torres, and following Nåsell, introduce stochasticity in the model through time-varying population sizes of different compartments. Besides, Metcalf’s group observed that the relative risk of extinction of some infections on islands is almost double that in the mainlands i.e. infections cease to exist at a significantly higher rate in islands compared to the mainlands. They attributed this phenomenon to the greater recolonization in the mainlands. Interestingly, the application of our method on demographic facts and figures of countries in the AIDS belt of Africa led us to expect that existing control measures and isolated locations would assist in temporary eradication of HIV infection much faster. For example, our method suggests that through systematic control strategies, after 7.36 years HIV epidemics will temporarily be eradicated from different communes of island nation Madagascar, where the population size falls below its CCS value, unless the disease is reintroduced from outside."

Methods In one year at a single facility, relative telomere length and SNPs were determined by using monochrome multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays, respectively, and were compared with lifestyle-related diseases in 120 Japanese individuals near our university. Results In men and all participants, age was inversely correlated with relative telomere length with respective p values of 0.049 and 0.034. In men, the frequency of hypertension was significantly higher in the short relative telomere length group than in the long group with unadjusted p value of 0.039, and the difference in the frequency of hypertension between the two groups was of borderline statistical significance after adjustment for age ( p = 0.057). Furthermore, in men and all participants, the sum of the number of affected lifestyle-related diseases, including hypertension, was significantly higher in the short relative telomere length group than in the long group, with p values of 0.004 and 0.029, respectively. For ADIPOQ rs1501299 , men’s ankle brachial index was higher in the T/T genotype than in the G/G and G/T genotypes, with p values of 0.001 and 0.000, respectively. For SIRT1 rs7895833 , men’s body mass index and waist circumference and all participants’ brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity were higher in the A/G genotype than in the G/G genotype, with respective p values of 0.048, 0.032 and 0.035. For FOXO3A rs2802292 , women’s body temperature and all participants’ saturation of peripheral oxygen were lower in the G/T genotype than in the T/T genotype, with respective p values of 0.039 and 0.032. However, relative telomere length was not associated with physiological or anthropometric measurements except for height in men ( p = 0.016). ADIPOQ rs1501299 in men, but not the other two SNPs, was significantly associated with the sum of the number of affected lifestyle-related diseases ( p = 0.013), by genotype. For each SNPs, there was no significant difference in the frequency of hypertension or relative telomere length by genotype. Conclusion Relative telomere length and the three types of SNPs determined using saliva have been shown to be differentially associated with onset of and measured risk factors for lifestyle-related diseases consisting mainly of cardiovascular diseases and cancer."

https://openalex.org/W3125118500,"Purpose SDG 5.3 targets include eliminating harmful practices such as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). Limited information is available about levels of investment needed and realistic estimates of potential incidence change. In this work, we estimate the cost and impact of FGM programs in 31 high burden countries. Methods This analysis combines program data, secondary data analysis, and population-level costing methods to estimate cost and impact of high and moderate scaleup of FGM programs between 2020 and 2030. Cost per person or community reached was multiplied by populations to estimate costs, and regression analysis was used to estimate new incidence rates, which were applied to populations to estimate cases averted. Results Reaching the high-coverage targets for 31 countries by 2030 would require an investment of US$ 3.3 billion. This scenario would avert more than 24 million cases of FGM, at an average cost of US$ 134 per case averted. A moderate-coverage scenario would cost US$ 1.6 billion and avert more than 12 million cases of FGM. However, average cost per case averted hides substantial variation based on country dynamics. The most cost-effective investment would be in countries with limited historic change in FGM incidence, with the average cost per case averted between US$ 3 and US$ 90. The next most effective would be those with high approval for FGM, but a preexisting trend downward, where cost per case averted is estimated at around US$ 240. Interpretation This analysis shows that although data on FGM is limited, we can draw useful findings from population-level surveys and program data to guide resource mobilization and program planning."

In this study, we have further investigated the previously described cellular extensions formed by the medaka ( Oryzias latipes ) luteinizing hormone gonadotropes (Lh cells). Extensions, several cell diameters long, with varicosity-like swellings, were common both in vitro and in vivo . Some extensions approached other Lh cells, while others were in close contact with blood vessels in vivo . Gnrh further stimulated extension development in vitro . Two types of extensions with different characteristics could be distinguished, and were classified as major or minor according to size, origin and cytoskeleton protein dependance. The varicosity-like swellings appeared on the major extensions and were dependent on both microtubules and actin filaments. Immunofluorescence revealed that Lhβ protein was mainly located in these swellings and at the extremity of the extensions. We then investigated whether these extensions contribute to network formation and clustering, by following their development in primary cultures. During the first two days in culture, the Lh cells grew long extensions that with time physically attached to other cells. Successively, tight cell clusters formed as cell somas that were connected via extensions migrated towards each other, while shortening their extensions. Laser photolysis of caged Ca 2+ showed that Ca 2+ signals originating in the soma propagated from the soma along the major extensions, being particularly visible in each swelling. Moreover, the Ca 2+ signal could be transferred between densely clustered cells (sharing soma-soma border), but was not transferred via extensions to the connected cell. In summary, Lh gonadotropes in medaka display a complex cellular structure of hormone-containing extensions that are sensitive to Gnrh, and may be used for clustering and possibly hormone release, but do not seem to contribute to communication between cells themselves."

We conjecture that the source of financial support can mitigate this moral hazard effect due to social preferences. We compare effort choices when another individual voluntarily provides financial support against effort choices under purely monetary incentives. When financial support is provided voluntarily by another individual, we expect recipients to exert more effort to avoid bad outcomes (level effect) and to reduce effort provision to a lesser degree as financial support becomes more generous (sensitivity effect). We conducted an incentivized laboratory experiment and find some evidence for the level effect and strong evidence for the sensitivity effect. This leads to significant gains in material efficiency with expected wealth being 5.5% higher and 37.3% less volatile."
