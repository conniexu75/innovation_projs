https://openalex.org/W2038334243,"For many drugs, only racemic mixtures are available for clinical use. Because different stereoisomers of drugs often cause different physiological responses, the use of pure isomers could elicit more exact therapeutic effects. Differential complexation of a variety of drug stereoisomers by immobilized beta-cyclodextrin was investigated. Chiral recognition and racemic resolution were observed with a number of compounds from such clinically useful classes as beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, sedative hypnotics, antihistamines, anticonvulsants, diuretics, and synthetic opiates. Separation of the diastereomers of the cardioactive and antimalarial cinchona alkaloids and of two antiestrogens was demonstrated as well. Three dimensional projections of beta-cyclodextrin complexes of propanolol, which is resolved by this technique, and warfarin, which is not, are compared. These studies have improved the understanding and application of the chiral interactions of beta-cyclodextrin, and they have demonstrated a means to measure optical purity and to isolate or produce pure enantiomers of drugs. In addition, this highly specific technique could also be used in the pharmacological evaluation of enantiomeric drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2077624336,"Electrical stimulation of axons in the hippocampus with short high-frequency bursts that resemble in vivo activity patterns produces stable potentiation of postsynaptic responses when the bursts occur at intervals of 200 milliseconds but not 2 seconds. When a burst was applied to one input and a second burst applied to a different input to the same target neuron 200 milliseconds later, only the synapses activated by the second burst showed stable potentiation. This effect was observed even when the two inputs innervated completely different regions of the postsynaptic cells; but did not occur when the inputs were stimulated simultaneously or when the second burst was delayed by 2 seconds. Intracellular recordings indicated that the first burst extended the decay phase of excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked 200 milliseconds later. These results suggest that a single burst of axonal stimulation produces a transient, spatially diffuse ""priming"" effect that prolongs responses to subsequent bursts, and that these altered responses trigger spatially restricted synaptic modifications. The similarity of the temporal parameters of the priming effect and the theta rhythm that dominates the hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG) during learning episodes suggests that this priming may be involved in behaviorally induced synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1536607091,"Anthrax lethal toxin, which consists of two proteins, protective antigen and lethal factor, is lethal for experimental animals. This study describes the first in vitro system demonstrating lethality of the toxin. Mouse peritoneal macrophages are killed within 1 h of exposure to the toxin. Neither protein component alone shows any toxic activity. The minimal effective concentration of protective antigen and lethal factor was approximately equal to 10(-2) and approximately equal to 10(-3) micrograms/ml, respectively. None of the several established cell lines examined was killed. Cells could be completely protected from the toxin by pretreatment with agents, such as amines or monensin, which dissipate intracellular proton gradients and raise the pH of intracellular vesicles. This protection was reversible and could be overcome by lowering the intravesicular pH. Antitoxin added after preincubation with amines was unable to protect cells subsequently exposed to low pH treatment. These results suggest that anthrax lethal toxin requires passage through an acidic endocytic vesicle in order to exert its toxic effect within the cytosol."

https://openalex.org/W2079212189,"We have cloned and sequenced a new human oncogene and have named it mas. This oncogene was detected by its tumorigenicity in nude mice using the cotransfection and tumorigenicity assay previously described. The mas oncogene has a weak focus-inducing activity in transfected NIH 3T3 cells. A DNA rearrangement in the 5' noncoding sequence, which occurred during transfection, is probably responsible for activation of the mas gene. The cDNA sequence of the mas oncogene reveals a long open reading frame that codes for a 325 amino acid protein. This protein is very hydrophobic and has seven potential transmembrane domains. In this respect, the structure of the mas protein is novel among cellular oncogene products and may reflect a new functional class of oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W1990839929,"We have microinjected biotinylated tubulin into mitotic fibroblast cells to identify the sites in the spindle at which new subunits are incorporated into microtubules (MTs). Labeled subunits were visualized in the electron microscope using an antibody to biotin followed by a secondary antibody coupled to colloidal gold. Astral MTs incorporate labeled subunits very rapidly by elongation of existing MTs and by new nucleation from the centrosome. At a slower rate, kinetochore MTs incorporate subunits at the kinetochore progressively during metaphase, suggesting a slow poleward flux of subunits in the kinetochore fiber. When cells injected in metaphase were examined in anaphase, a significant fraction of kinetochore MTs was unlabeled, suggesting that depolymerization had occurred at the kinetochore concomitant with chromosome to pole movement. The existence of opposite fluxes at the kinetochore during metaphase and anaphase suggests that two separate forces are responsible for chromosome congression and anaphase movement."
https://openalex.org/W2053116782,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to monitor, on a beat-to-beat basis, the concentration of creatine phosphate and adenosine triphosphate during alterations in the work output of canine hearts in vivo. Over a wide range of rate-pressure products (5,000 to 25,000 mmHg/min), the relative amounts of creatine phosphate and adenosine triphosphate within the heart remained constant. The relative concentration of free adenosine diphosphate was calculated under the reasonable assumption that the creatine kinase-catalyzed reaction is near equilibrium in this tissue. The free concentration of adenosine diphosphate also did not change over this range of rate-pressure products. The data demonstrate that the concentration of these compounds is highly regulated in vivo and suggest that factors other than their concentration may be involved in the modulation of steady-state myocardial work output with oxygen consumption."
https://openalex.org/W1989725152,"The current pertussis vaccines, although efficacious, in some instances produce undesirable side effects. Molecular engineering of pertussis toxin, the major protective antigen, could provide a safer, new generation of vaccines against whooping cough. As a first critical step in the development of such a vaccine, the complete nucleotide sequence of the pertussis toxin gene was determined and the amino acid sequences of the individual subunits were deduced. All five subunits are coded by closely linked cistrons. A promoter-like structure was found in the 5'-flanking region, suggesting that the toxin is expressed through a polycistronic messenger RNA. The order of the cistrons is S1, S2, S4, S5, and S3. All subunits contain signal peptides of variable length. The calculated molecular weights of the mature subunits are 26,024 for S1, 21,924 for S2, 21,873 for S3, 12,058 for S4, and 11,013 for S5. Subunits S2 and S3 share 70% amino acid homology and 75% nucleotide homology. Subunit S1 contains two regions of eight amino acids homologous to analogous regions in the A subunit of both cholera and Escherichia coli heat labile toxins."
https://openalex.org/W1975725195,"The three-dimensional crystal structure of the adenovirus major coat protein is presented. Adenovirus type 2 hexon, at 967 residues, is now the longest polypeptide whose structure has been determined crystallographically. Taken with our model for hexon packing, which positions the 240 trimeric hexons in the capsid, the structure defines 60% of the protein within the 150 X 10(6) dalton virion. The assembly provides the first details of a DNA-containing animal virus that is 20 times larger than the spherical RNA viruses previously described. Unexpectedly, the hexon subunit contains two similar beta-barrels whose topology is identical to those of the spherical RNA viruses, but whose architectural role in adenovirus is very different. The hexon structure reveals several distinctive features related to its function as a stable protective coat, and shows that the type-specific immunological determinants are restricted to the virion surface."

https://openalex.org/W2076350281,"The human rRNA promoter contains two distinct cis-control sequences, the core and upstream control element (UCE), that serve as the target for binding cellular trans-activating proteins involved in transcription initiation by RNA polymerase I. One of these factors, SL1, has been extensively purified and shown to be a species-specific factor required to reconstitute in vitro RNA synthesis. DNAase footprinting revealed that although SL1 alone does not bind specifically to rRNA promoter sequences, a second factor, UBF1, recruits SL1 to the template and directs binding to an extended region encompassing sequences in the UCE. Analysis of mutant and human-mouse hybrid promoters indicate that protein-DNA interactions at the UCE modulate the efficiency of rRNA synthesis. Transcription from the human rRNA promoter appears to require an unusual set of protein-DNA transactions in which recognition and binding to an upstream cis-control element is carried out by one factor (UBF1), whereas activation requires an additional factor, SL1, acting in conjunction with UBF1 to trigger transcription."

https://openalex.org/W1486711418,"The phospholipid, sn-1,2-diacylglycerol, and calcium dependencies of rat brain protein kinase C were investigated with a mixed micellar assay (Hannun, Y., Loomis, C., and Bell, R.M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 10039-10043). Protein kinase C activity was independent of the number of Triton X-100, phosphatidylserine (PS), and sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol (diC18:1) mixed micelles. Activation was strongly dependent on the mole per cent of PS and diC18:1. Activity of protein kinase C was dependent on PS, diC18:1, and calcium in mixed micelles prepared from detergents other than Triton X-100. This is consistent with the micelle providing an inert surface into which the lipid cofactors partition. Molecular sieve chromatography provided direct evidence for the homogeneity of Triton X-100, PS, and diC18:1 mixed micelles. Mixing studies and surface dilution studies indicated that PS and diC18:1 rapidly equilibrate among the mixed micelles. At saturating calcium, the diC18:1 dependence was strongly dependent on the mole per cent PS present. At 10 mol % PS, 0.25 mol % diC18:1 gave maximal activity whereas 6 mol % PS and 6 mol % diC18:1 did not give maximal activity. diC18:1 dependencies were hyperbolic at all PS levels tested. The data support the conclusion that a single molecule of diC18:1/micelle is sufficient to activate monomeric protein kinase C. The mole per cent PS required for maximal activation was reduced markedly as the mole per cent diC18:1 increased. Under all conditions tested, the PS dependence of protein kinase C activation lagged until greater than 3 mol % PS was present. Then activation occurred in a cooperative manner with Hill numbers near 4. These data indicate that 4 or more molecules of PS are required to activate monomeric protein kinase C. PS was the most effective of all the phospholipids tested in the mixed micelle assay. diC18:1 was found to modulate the amount of calcium required for maximal activity. As the level of Ca2+ increased, the mole per cent PS required reached a limiting value of 3 mol %. A number of sn-1,2-diacylglycerols containing short chain fatty acids activated protein kinase C in a saturable manner in mixed micelles. The data are discussed in relation to a model for protein kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2069235651,"We have used a DNAase I genomic footprinting procedure to detect interactions between cellular factors and the regulatory sequences of the human beta-interferon gene. Prior to induction with poly(I)-poly(C), factors that bind to DNA are detected in one region located between -94 and -167 from the mRNA cap site, and in another region located between -68 and -38. After induction these factors dissociate and another factor binds to a region located between -77 and -64. Correlation of these footprints with the effects of deletions in the regulatory region of the beta-interferon gene (accompanying paper) suggest that the factors that bind prior to induction are repressor molecules, while the component that binds after induction is a transcription factor. Dissociation of the repressor molecules from the DNA after induction may allow the transcription factor to bind to and activate the beta-interferon promoter. Thus, the beta-interferon gene may be controlled by a negative regulatory mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2076194872,"Phenotypically normal petunia plants carrying chromosomal inserts of either the tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) A or the B component DNA, as single or tandem inserts, were obtained using an Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti plasmid-based transformation system. Southern hybridization analysis revealed that the tandem, direct-repeat A plants contained free single and double stranded A component DNAs. No free B component DNA was detected in plants carrying tandem repeats of the B component. Progeny of self-fertilized plants appeared normal. In contrast, one-quarter of the progeny from tandem A by tandem B plant crosses showed chlorotic lesions on their leaves similar to virus symptoms. The significance of these results and the use of this method for the study of virus functions involved in TGMV replication and symptom production are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1554531151,"A potent anticoagulant, anti-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) factor, found in limulus hemocytes inhibits the LPS-mediated activation of limulus coagulation cascade and shows an antibacterial action against R-types of Gram-negative bacteria (Morita, T., Ohtsubo, S., Nakamura, T., Tanaka, S., Iwanaga, S., Ohashi, K., and Niwa, M. (1985) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 97, 1611-1620). The complete amino acid sequence of this substance was determined by sequencing the peptides obtained by selective proteolytic cleavage. The NH2-terminal end of anti-LPS factor was pyroglutamic acid. Anti-LPS factor had two variant residues at position 36 and the COOH-terminal end, respectively. The following sequence was assigned to anti-LPS factor, and it was also confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. less than EGGIWTQLALALVKNLATLWQSGDFQFLGHE (formula; see text) Limulus anti-LPS factor consisted of a single chain of 102 residues with 2 half-cystines in disulfide linkage. Its NH2-terminal region up to 20 residues was highly hydrophobic, and positively charged residues were clustered mainly within the disulfide loop. By searching the homologous sequence in known protein sequences with that of anti-LPS factor, we found a structural homology between anti-LPS factor and alpha-lactalbumin/lysozyme family."

The DNA forms an unwound right-handed double helix. Four base pairs are of the Watson-Crick type while four are Hoogsteen base pairs, including two A.T and two G.C base pairs. This is the first observation in an oligonucleotide of Hoogsteen G.C base pairs where the cystosine is protonated. It is likely that these also occur in solutions of DNA complexed to this antibiotic."
https://openalex.org/W1490558413,"The 2 mu plasmid of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a site-specific recombination system consisting of plasmid-encoded FLP protein and two recombination sites on the plasmid. The recombination site possesses a specific orientation, which is determined by an asymmetric 8-base pair spacer sequence separating two 13-base pair inverted repeats. The outcome or directionality of site-specific recombination is defined by the alignment of two sites in the same orientation during the reaction. Sites containing point mutations or 1-base pair insertions or deletions within the spacer generally undergo recombination with unaltered sites at reduced levels. In contrast, recombination between the two identical mutant sites (where homology is restored) proceeds efficiently in all cases. Sites containing spacer sequences of 10 base pairs or more are nonfunctional under all conditions. A recombination site in which 5 base pairs are changed to yield an entirely symmetrical spacer sequence again recombines efficiently, but only with an identical site. This reaction, in addition, produces a variety of new products which can only result from random alignment of the two sites undergoing recombination, i.e. the reaction no longer exhibits directionality. These and other results demonstrate that both the efficiency and directionality of site-specific recombination is dependent upon homology between spacer sequences of the two recombining sites. This further implies that critical DNA-DNA interactions between the spacer region of the two sites involved in the reaction occur at some stage during site-specific recombination in this system. The specific spacer sequence itself appears to be unimportant as long as homology is maintained; thus, these sequences are probably not involved in recognition by FLP protein."
https://openalex.org/W1497814442,"We have investigated the binding of a series of high affinity asparagine-linked glycopeptides, including high mannose type and a bisected hybrid type, and several related synthetic oligosaccharides, to Ca2+- Mn2+-concanavalin A (ConA), using solvent proton nuclear relaxation dispersion (NMRD) measurements. We find that binding of the glycopeptides induces a common smaller decrease in the NMRD profile of ConA compared to that induced by monosaccharide binding. This effect is also observed with a synthetic analog of complex-type carbohydrates, hepta, which also shows enhanced affinity for the protein relative to monosaccharide binding. The high affinity of the glycopeptides and hepta, and their unique effects on the NMRD profile, are mimicked by binding of the trimannosyl oligosaccharide, 3,6-di-O-(alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-D-mannose, which is present as a structural element in all of the glycopeptides and synthetic oligosaccharides. However, adding a so-called bisecting N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue to the trimannosyl oligosaccharide greatly reduces its binding affinity and produces a decrease in the NMRD profile of the protein similar to that observed for monosaccharide binding. These results indicate that the trimannosyl oligosaccharide is a unique moiety recognized by the lectin for high affinity and extended site binding, and the presence of a bisecting N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue in the trimannosyl oligosaccharide eliminates this type of interaction. The results also demonstrate that ConA primarily binds to the outer trimannosyl regions of high mannose and bisected hybrid-type glycopeptides compared to the central trimannosyl region of complex glycopeptides. Two mechanisms of enhanced affinity binding of saccharides and glycopeptides to ConA are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1528557572,"A small-scale affinity chromatographic procedure was developed to screen for the presence of fucose and mannose/N-acetylglucosamine-binding lectins in small amounts of rat tissues. Of all tissues examined, only the liver contained the fucose-binding lectin, whereas both liver and blood serum contained the mannose/N-acetylglucosamine lectin. By means of immunocytological methods using antibodies to hepatic lectins, the fucose lectin was shown to be uniquely present in Kupffer cells and absent in all other types of rat macrophages examined. The binding and uptake of different neoglycoproteins by nonparenchymal cell fractions of liver indicated that the fucose-binding lectin was either not responsible for the uptake or that more than one lectin was acting. With the identification of another lectin (Mr = 180,000) by the above screening procedure for hepatic lectins and the results of studies in the following paper (Haltiwanger, R.S., and Hill, R. L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7440-7444) two lectins appear to be involved. A small amount of the hepatic mannose/N-acetylglucosamine lectin was found by the above screening procedure to have a higher affinity for L-fucosyl-bovine serum albumin-Sepharose than the majority of the lectin in hepatocytes. This lectin, called the high affinity form, was purified and its properties examined. On a weight basis the high affinity form bound 7-12 times more ligand than the normal form. Its Ka for L-fucosyl-bovine serum albumin was 2.3 X 10(9) M-1 compared to 3.5 X 10(8) M-1 for the normal form. Moreover, the concentrations of monosaccharides required to inhibit the high affinity form were about 3 times less than those required to inhibit binding of the normal form. The two forms, however, have identical molecular weights (32,000) under reducing and nonreducing conditions, bind anti-lectin antibodies in the same way, and give identical peptide maps after V-8 protease digestion. The structural basis for the different binding affinities of the two forms remains unknown."

https://openalex.org/W1561078613,"The parameters that affect the interaction of ligands with a fucose-binding lectin from rat liver have been examined. 125I-Fucosyl-bovine serum albumin (Fuc-BSA) containing 50 residues of fucose/molecule was used as the standard ligand. At low initial concentrations of ligand (10 ng/ml) and lectin (140 ng/ml), the reaction reaches equilibrium at pH 7.8, 23 degrees C, within 40 min. The binding of ligands is Ca2+ dependent with half-maximal binding occurring at 54 microM Ca2+; of several metal ions tested, only Sr2+ partially replaced Ca2+. Binding was maximal between pH 7.6 and 8.6, fell slightly up to pH 10, but fell markedly below pH 7. The lectin-ligand complexes dissociated at low pH, on removal of Ca2+, or in the presence of a large excess of competing ligand. The apparent association constant (Ka) for Fuc-BSA was 1.75 X 10(8) M-1. The fucose content of the Fuc-BSA also influenced binding, with little apparent binding below 24 fucose residues/molecule and maximal binding from 40 to 50 fucose residues/molecule. With knowledge of the parameters influencing binding, sensitive reproducible assays for the lectin were developed. The binding specificity of the lectin was examined by measuring the inhibition of 125I-Fuc-BSA binding by neoglycoproteins, monosaccharides, and glycosides or by direct binding of neoglycoproteins. Galactosides and beta-linked fucosides were the best ligands among the neoglycoproteins, with much weaker binding by mannosyl- or N-acetylglucosaminyl-BSA. On the basis of the pattern of inhibition of Fuc-BSA binding by various monosaccharides and glycosides, it is possible to propose the conformations of saccharides that best fit the lectin-binding site. The C1 conformation of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine fits best, although other not obviously related monosaccharides such as L-fucose, L-arabinose, and D-mannose can also assume conformations that permit them to be effective inhibitors. The pattern of binding of neoglycoproteins to the lectin differs from that of other pure hepatic lectins. Thus, the fucose lectin has a high affinity for Fuc-BSA and galactosyl-BSA but a low affinity for N-acetylglucosaminyl-BSA. The galactose lectin binds only galactosyl-BSA and shows little binding with either N-acetylglucosaminyl-BSA or Fuc-BSA. In contrast, the mannose/N-acetylglucosamine lectin binds N-acetylglucosaminyl-BSA and Fuc-BSA but not galactosyl-BSA."
https://openalex.org/W1496352321,"Ascorbic acid enhancement of norepinephrine formation from tyrosine in cultured bovine chromaffin cells was characterized in detail as a model system for determining ascorbate requirements. In resting cells, ascorbic acid increased dopamine beta-monooxygenase activity without changing tyrosine 3-monooxygenase activity. [14C]Norepinephrine specific activity was increased by ascorbic acid, while [14C]dopamine specific activity was unchanged. Dopamine content, dopamine biosynthesis, tyrosine content, and tyrosine uptake were also unaffected by ascorbic acid. Furthermore, increased norepinephrine formation could not be attributed to changes in norepinephrine catabolism. Enhancement of dopamine beta-monooxygenase activity was specific for ascorbic acid, since other reducing agents with higher redox potentials were unable to increase norepinephrine formation. The specific effect of ascorbic acid on enhancement of norepinephrine formation was also observed in chromaffin cells stimulated to secrete with carbachol, acetylcholine, veratridine, and potassium chloride. In stimulated cells with and without ascorbate, there were no differences in dopamine content, tyrosine uptake, dopamine specific activity, and norepinephrine catabolism. These data indicate that, under a wide variety of conditions, only one catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme activity, dopamine beta-monooxygenase, is specifically stimulated by ascorbic acid alone in cultured chromaffin cells. This model system exemplifies a new approach for determining ascorbic acid requirements in cells and animals."

https://openalex.org/W1547427125,"A lectin with a high affinity for binding ligands through fucose residues has been purified to homogeneity from rat liver. Affinity chromatography of the lectin on fucosyl-bovine serum albumin-agarose is the key step in the purification. Contaminating amounts of a previously described lectin that binds mannose and N-acetylglucosamine are removed from the fucose-binding lectin by either immunoadsorption on anti-mannose/N-acetylglucosamine lectin IgG-agarose or by specific elution of the fucose-binding lectin from fucosyl-bovine serum albumin-agarose. The pure fucose-binding lectin contains two polypeptide subunits with molecular weights of 88,000 and 77,000, respectively, as judged by gel electrophoresis. Peptide maps of the subunits, however, show that they are very similar structurally. In addition, peptide maps show that the fucose lectin is structurally distinct from other rat hepatic lectins. This is supported by the lack of cross-reaction among the different rat liver lectins and their specific antibodies and the inability of specific antibodies to the mannose/N-acetylglucosamine lectin to inhibit the binding of fucosyl-bovine serum albumin by the fucose lectin."

The lectin was extracted from rat lung homogenates with Triton X-100, absorbed from the extract onto Fuc-BSA-Sepharose in the presence of Ca2+ and eluted by removal of Ca2+. After a second adsorption to and elution from Fuc-BSA-Sepharose, three protein species were detected electrophoretically in fractions that bind Fuc-BSA. One, which was the mannose/N-acetylglucosamine lectin (Mr = 32,000) found earlier in hepatocytes, was removed by adsorption on anti-lectin IgG-Sepharose. Another (Mr = 46,000) was removed by adsorption to Fuc-BSA-Sepharose and elution with galactose. The remaining lectin (Mr = 180,000) bound fucose and N-acetylglucosamine but not galactose. Binding was maximal between pH 6.5 and 9.0 and dependent on Ca2+. Immunocytological analysis with rabbit anti-lectin IgG and fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG revealed the lectin to be in rat alveolar macrophages and nonparenchymal cells of liver. Thus, the lectin appears to be present in macrophages and is likely involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. It is distinctly different structurally from the hepatocyte lectin with a similar ligand-binding specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1967229280,"Arginine vasopressin consists of a 20-membered, disulfide-linked macrocyclic ring system called pressinoic acid to which is attached a COOH-terminal tripeptide. The molecular conformation of pressinoic acid has been determined from single crystal x-ray diffraction data. The 20-membered macrocyclic ring, stabilized by two intramolecular hydrogen bonds, has a type I β-bend centered on Gln4 and Asn5 and a highly distorted type II' bend centered on Phe3 and Gln4. In vasopressin the Asn5 side chain extends away from the macrocyclic ring system and hydrogen bonds to the terminal tripeptide, but in pressinoic acid the Asn5 side chain lies over the molecule and forms a strong hydrogen bond to the nitrogen of Tyr2. The absence of pressor activity in pressinoic acid may be a result of both the loss of the COOH-terminal tripeptide and the incorrect orientation of the Asn5 side chain. Whether this class of hormones has pressor or oxytocic activity is determined by the orientation of the Tyr2 side chain, that is, whether it is extended away from or over the ring system, respectively. In pressinoic acid, the Tyr2 side chain is in the expected ""pressor conformation,"" that is, extended away from the ring system, and is stabilized through a hydrophobic interaction with the Phe3 side chain. Thus, the conformation of the pressinoic acid molecule partly explains the activity of vasopressin-like hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1958119041,"The transfer free energies of amino acid side chains from water to N-methylacetamide have been determined and compared with those obtained from other model systems. Although the process of transfer from water to N-methylacetamide represents transfer from a lower dielectric phase to a higher dielectric phase, the transfer free energies of most of the amino acid side chains are nearly the same as those obtained from the water to ethanol system. Among the apolar side chains studied, only the transfer free energies of methionine and the aromatic side chains are apparently influenced to some extent by the polarity of the organic solvent phase. The transfer free energies of the neutral polar side chains also exhibit significant dependence on solvent polarity. The van't Hoff plots for most of the apolar side chains exhibit nonlinear curves, indicating that the enthalpy of transfer from water to N-methylacetamide is temperature-dependent. It is suggested that to assess the contribution of the hydrophobic free energy to the stability of globular proteins, it is probably not necessary to account for variation in the internal environment of the protein."

The purification entails cell lysis and solubilization of gpL115 with the detergent Nonidet P-40, sequential affinity chromatography on lentil lectin-Sepharose, wheat germ lectin-Sepharose, and, after treatment with sialidase, on peanut lectin-Sepharose. Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration removes residual protein contaminants and transfers asialo-gpL115 from Nonidet P-40-containing to sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing buffer. The yield, 1300 micrograms of homogeneous protein/10(11) cells, represents greater than 60% recovery. The amino acid composition of gpL115 has several atypical features including low lysine content, high proline content, and very high content of hydroxyamino acids (12.5 residues of serine and 12.5 residues of threonine/100 amino acids). Total carbohydrate content of gpL115 is very high, i.e. 52% for the asialo-molecule. The major carbohydrate residues of asialo-gpL115 are galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine in approximately equimolar amounts (25 and 22 residues/100 amino acids, respectively) plus severalfold lower amounts of N-acetylglucosamine, fucose, and mannose."
https://openalex.org/W1605224830,"The transmembrane orientation of the human erythrocyte glucose transporter was assessed based on polarized Fourier transform infrared and ultraviolet circular dichroism spectroscopic data obtained from oriented multilamellar films of the reconstituted transporter vesicles. Infrared spectra revealed that there are distinct vibrations for alpha-helical structure while the vibrational frequencies specific to beta-structure are characteristically absent. Analysis of linear dichroism of the infrared spectra further indicated that these alpha-helices in the transporter are preferentially oriented perpendicular to the lipid bilayer plane forming an effective tilt of less than 38 degrees from the membrane normal. Such a preferential orientation was further supported by ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra which reveal that the 208 nm Moffit band found in the detergent-solubilized preparation is absent in the film preparation. Linear dichroism data further indicated that D-glucose, a typical substrate, further reduces this effective tilt angle slightly."
https://openalex.org/W1499957318,"The synthetic duplex DNA, poly(dI-dC).poly(dI-dC), is methylated in vitro by human or murine DNA methyltransferases at 20-100 times the rate of other nonmethylated DNAs. Preparation of the hemimethylated derivative, poly(dI-dMeC).poly(dI-dC), of this polymer increases its effectiveness as a substrate by 2-fold, making it 4-10 times more effective as a substrate for mammalian DNA methyltransferases than any other hemimethylated DNA so far reported. However, the apparent slower rate of de novo methylation of poly(dI-dC).poly(dI-dC) as compared to the hemimethylated derivative is due to substrate inhibition, unique to the unmethylated polymer, as the rates of de novo and maintenance methylation are identical at low substrate concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1581286295,"In cell-free protein synthesis studies with RNA from phage MS2 as template, normal Escherichia coli tRNASer3 promotes two base translocation at GCA alanine codons with a resultant shift of ribosomes to the minus one reading frame. Similarly, normal tRNAThr3 promotes two base translocation at CCG proline codons. These conclusions were reached by amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides or cyanogen bromide fragments that contained the reading frame shift site. It is proposed that these frameshift events occur by a two-base pair interaction between the anticodons of these exceptional tRNAs and the noncognate codons."
https://openalex.org/W1516567585,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity in microsomes isolated from cultured lymphoid (IM-9) cells or freshly isolated human leukocytes was markedly decreased by either ascorbic acid or its oxidized derivative, dehydroascorbate. Inhibition of IM-9 leukocyte HMG-CoA reductase activity was log linear between 0.01 and 10 mM ascorbic acid (25 and 81% inhibition, respectively) and 0.1 and 10 mM dehydroascorbate (5 and 75% inhibition, respectively). Inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to HMG-CoA (Km = 10.2 microM (RS); ascorbic acid, Ki = 6.4 mM; dehydroascorbate, Ki = 15 mM) and competitive with respect to NADPH (Km = 16.3 microM; acetic acid, Ki = 6.3 mM; dehydroascorbate, Ki = 3.1 mM). Ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbate are interconverted through the free radical intermediate monodehydroascorbate. Reducing agents are required to convert dehydroascorbate to monodehydroascorbate, but prevent formation of the free radical from ascorbate. In microsomes from IM-9 cells, the reducing agent, dithiothreitol, abolished HMG-CoA reductase inhibition by ascorbate but enhanced inhibition by dehydroascorbate. In addition, the concentration of monodehydroascorbate present in ascorbate solutions was directly proportional to the degree of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition by 1.0 mM ascorbate. Fifty per cent inhibition of enzyme activity occurred at a monodehydroascorbate concentration of 14 microM. These data indicate that monodehydroascorbate mediates inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by both ascorbate and dehydroascorbate. This effect does not appear to be due to free radical-induced membrane lipid modification, however, since both ascorbate and dehydroascorbate inhibited the protease-solubilized, partially purified human liver enzyme. Since inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase occurs at physiological concentrations of ascorbic acid in the human leukocyte (0.2-1.72 mM), this vitamin may be important in the regulation of endogenous cholesterol synthesis in man."
https://openalex.org/W1511240493,"Using a sterol auxotroph of the LM cell mouse fibroblast, we demonstrate that relatively few cholesterol analogues can substitute for cholesterol as a growth factor. The auxotroph grows normally on desmosterol and trans-22-dehydrocholesterol and at reduced rates on dihydrocholesterol, campesterol, and 22,23-dihydrobrassicasterol. It does not grow with beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, ergosterol, or cis-22-dehydrocholesterol when the sterol is present as sole supplement but does grow at normal rates when the analogue is supplied with suboptimal amounts of cholesterol. Two contrasting types of membrane lipid changes are observed in cells grown on cholesterol analogues. In cells grown with dihydrocholesterol, a marked increase in desaturation and elongation of fatty acids is noted. Conversely, when cells are grown with cis-22-dehydrocholesterol, desaturation and elongation of fatty acids are severely curtailed. Cells grown on alkyl sterols respond like cells grown on cis-22-dehydrocholesterol but in a less pronounced fashion. The effects of sterol substitution in mammalian cells versus in lower eukaryotes are compared, and an explanation for the secondary changes in fatty acid composition in terms of phospholipid phase behavior is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W1563298349,"Studies of the spatial organization of DNA replication have provided increasing evidence of the importance of the nuclear matrix. We have previously reported a relationship between rates of DNA synthesis and the differential binding of DNA polymerase alpha to the nuclear matrix over the S-phase. We now report the detection of DNA primase bound to the HeLa nuclear matrix. Matrix-bound primase was measured both indirectly, by the incorporation of [32P]dAMP into an unprimed single-stranded template, poly(dT), and directly, by the incorporation of [3H]AMP into matrix DNA. Characteristics of this system include a requirement for ATP, inhibition by adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate), a primase inhibitor, and insensitivity to aphidicolin and alpha-amanitine, inhibitors of polymerase alpha and RNA polymerase, respectively. Subcellular quantification of primase and polymerase alpha activity revealed that while most (approximately 72%) primase activity is bound to the matrix, only a minority (approximately 32%) of polymerase alpha activity is matrix-bound. Treatment of the nuclear matrix with beta-D-octylglucoside allowed the solubilization of approximately 54% of primase activity and approximately 39% of the polymerase alpha activity. This data provides further evidence of a structural and functional role for the nuclear matrix in DNA replication. The ability to solubilize matrix-bound replicative enzymes may prove to be an important tool in the elucidation of the spatial organization of DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1850920035,"Phospholipid-sterol interactions were investigated using parinaric acid fluorescence spectroscopy. Cholesterol and cholesterol analogues which were modified in the sterol nucleus or side chain were added at 50 mol % to multilamellar vesicles of model phospholipids selected to be representative of major components in an LM cell plasma membrane. These included sphingomyelins and saturated and monounsaturated phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines. Based on the changes in cis-parinaric acid steady-state fluorescence polarization observed with addition of sterol, 50 mol % cholesterol abolished the phase transition of all the model phospholipids. Dihydrocholesterol and trans-22-dehydrocholesterol behaved like cholesterol in the two systems studied. 24-Methylcholesterols interacted well with all phospholipids except phosphatidylethanolamine which contained an unsaturated fatty acid. 24-Alkyl,trans-22-dehydrocholesterols abolished the phase transition in only two systems: sphingomyelins and phosphatidylcholines possessing relatively short saturated acyl chains. Since steady-state anisotropy is a function of fluorescence lifetime, rotational diffusion rates, and limiting anisotropy, we determined these parameters for two of the phospholipid systems. The results show that steady-state anisotropy values for phospholipid-sterol interactions correlate closely with limiting anisotropy and to a lesser extent with rotational relaxation time. The behavior of the sterols in the model phospholipids are used to interpret 1) fluorescence polarization measurements made with phospholipids extracted from LM cell plasma membranes, and 2) changes in membrane lipid composition which accompany growth of LM cells on various sterols."
https://openalex.org/W1525187926,"The membrane domain of NADH-cytochrome-b5 reductase, which extends from the amino-terminal myristic acid through the first 28 amino acid residues, can be isolated in cholate after a mild trypsin treatment of cholate-solubilized reductase, and in phospholipid vesicles after exhaustive trypsin treatment of vesicle-bound reductase. The detergent-solubilized peptide has a high affinity for phospholipid vesicles and can be reconstituted in vesicles by the detergent-dialysis method. The fluorescence of Trp-16 of this peptide is highly sensitive to the polarity of the microenvironment. The fluorescence quantum yield of this residue is 0.10 when the peptide is dispersed in 1% sodium cholate, but 0.46-0.52 when the peptide is reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles. Fluorescence energy transfer from this tryptophan residue in vesicle-bound peptide to a random array of acceptors in the head-group region of the vesicle outer monolayer shows that Trp-16 resides at a depth of 20-23 A in the bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1532495168,"Hepatocyte intracellular membranes may facilitate the directed movement of bilirubin and other hydrophobic substrates to the active site of UDP-glucuronyltransferase in the endoplasmic reticulum. We postulated that the lipid composition and physical properties of membranes that transport substrate may modulate bilirubin glucuronidation. To examine this hypothesis, we incorporated [14C]bilirubin substrate into the membrane bilayer of small unilamellar liposomes composed of native phospholipid purified from rat hepatic microsomes. The initial velocity of bilirubin glucuronide formation in rat liver microsomes, measured by radiochemical assay, was considerably more rapid than for bilirubin in liposomes of egg phosphatidylcholine (p less than 0.001). Moreover, the ratio of bilirubin diglucuronide to monoglucuronides synthesized was markedly increased (p less than 0.01), approaching that observed in normal rat bile. Although the rates of bilirubin glucuronidation did not correlate with fluidity of the liposomal membrane core region, specific phospholipid head groups were associated with an increase, and cholesterol a decrease, in rates of glucuronidation. Movement of [3H]bilirubin from dual-labeled liposomes to microsomes occurred without concomitant [14C]phospholipid transfer. Thus, the lipid composition of membranes incorporating bilirubin appears to modulate the rate of glucuronidation and the relative rates of bilirubin mono- and diglucuronide formation. Phospholipid head groups on the surface of the bilayer, not the hydrocarbon core regions, may be implicated in the rapid process of membrane transport, which is likely to involve membrane-membrane collisions or diffusion of free substrate rather than membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1595208223,"Abstract In the carboxypeptidase A-catalyzed ester hydrolysis of the trans-alpha-(benzoylamino)cinnamoyl derivatives of both L-mandelate and L-beta-phenyllactate, kcat stands for the breakdown of an additional enzyme-substrate complex (ES'). The pH dependence of kcat indicates that ES' is the anhydride acylcarboxypeptidase A formed by the nucleophilic attack of Glu-270 for both of the ester substrates. Furthermore, the very similar kcat values for the two ester substrates which share a common acyl moiety strongly suggest that common acylenzyme intermediates are involved, whose breakdown process is little affected by the cleaved alcohol portions. This provides the most direct evidence that has been reported for the nucleophilic mechanism of the carboxypeptidase A action."
https://openalex.org/W2053441676,"The conformation of the histone octamer is shown to depend upon the specific salt used to solubilize it. In 2M sodium chloride the octamer is similar in size and shape to the histone component of crystallized core nucleosomes. In contrast, in 3.5M ammonium sulfate the octamer is elongated, resembling an ellipsoid with approximate dimensions of 114 by 62 by 62 angstroms. These results indicate that the elongated conformation seen in the 3.3 angstroms electron density map of the histone octamer crystallized in ammonium sulfate is due to the particular salt conditions used."
https://openalex.org/W1549330935,"In the course of a half-reaction of enzymic transamination, the aldimine adduct formed between the coenzyme pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and the amino acid substrate tautomerizes to the ketimine intermediate which is then hydrolyzed to the oxo acid product and the pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate form of the enzyme. In the reverse half-reaction the tautomerization is initiated by the removal of a proton from the pro-S position at C-4' of the PMP moiety of the ketimine intermediate. The present study investigates the question whether the pro-S hydrogen at C-4' of PMP is labilized by its active site environment independently of the formation of the ketimine intermediate, i.e. in the absence of substrate. Reconstitution of apoaspartate aminotransferase (mitochondrial isoenzyme from chicken) with [4'-3H] PMP results indeed in a stereospecific exchange of pro-S 3H with solvent water. The exchange follows first order kinetics (t 1/2 = 23 min at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C). Unbound PMP showed no measurable exchange. Rigorous control experiments excluded the possibility that the observed exchange was due to a transamination reaction of the enzyme with contaminating oxo acid substrates. The newly observed stereospecific exchange reaction allows to investigate the acid/base properties of C-4' and the modulating effects of its active site environment independently of the preceding and following steps of enzymic transamination."
https://openalex.org/W1576833247,"Proalbumin differs from serum albumin in containing a leading hexapeptide segment, Arg-Gly-Val-Phe-Arg-Arg. This propeptide is removed in the Golgi complex immediately prior to secretion of the albumin, but its fate and possible functions are unknown. We have tested for the presence of the propeptide and its immediate catabolic products in rat liver and plasma and have studied both the disappearance of 3H-propeptide after intravenous injection and the breakdown of synthetic propeptide by rat liver cell components and plasma in vitro. We found no detectable propeptide or its two pentapeptide derivatives in rat liver or plasma at a sensitivity of less than 1 microM. Injected 3H-propeptide was completely cleared from blood within 2 min. No binding of free propeptide to serum albumin was observed. Liver cell fractions as well as blood plasma degraded added propeptide, with the highest activity being observed in smooth microsomes, the Golgi-enriched fraction, and plasma membrane. These preparations chiefly removed the terminal arginine residues, whereas enzymes in the cytosol degraded the peptide completely to amino acids. The activity in plasma resided largely in an alpha-globulin with molecular mass of about 280,000 Da which appears to be carboxypeptidase N. We conclude that the liberated propeptide is quickly broken down within the liver cell and does not accumulate in an amount sufficient to exert feedback or other effects on albumin synthesis."
