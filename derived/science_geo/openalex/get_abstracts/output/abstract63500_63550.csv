https://openalex.org/W1965121084,"Hemagglutination assays are described for measuring hepatitis-associated Australia antigen and antibody. Red cells coated with isolated antigen, with chromic chloride as a coupling agent, are used for detection of antibodies. Detection of the antigen in serums depends on inhibition of hemagglutination. The test has the sensitivity and rapidity of the best tests available, is simpler to perform, and lends itself to large-scale screening of blood donors."
https://openalex.org/W1972824411,"Azide and, to a lesser extent, cyanide inhibit the microbicidal activity of myeloperoxidase and of intact normal leukocytes, but they have little or no effect on peroxidase-negative leukocytes. The contribution of the azide-sensitive (peroxidase-dependent?) systems to the total microbicidal activity of normal leukocytes is considerable. The azide-insensitive antimicrobial systems are more highly developed in peroxidase-negative leukocytes than in normal leukocytes, thus suggesting an adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W1581771910,"The impressive homologies between mitochondria and plastids, on the one hand, and procaryotic organisms, on the other, make it almost certain that these important cellular organelles had their origin as independent organisms. The vast number of symbiotic relationships of all degrees of evolutionary antiquity which have been found in contemporary organisms point to the ease with which such relationships can be established."
https://openalex.org/W2059320779,Erythrocytes infected with chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum bind chloroquine with an apparent intrinsic association constant of 1.5 × 107 liters per mole. Such high-affinity binding of chloroquine is absent or deficient in uninfected erythrocytes and in erythrocytes infected with chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum.

https://openalex.org/W1609365613,"Abstract Adenyl cyclase activity of the parotid gland dropped by about 50% after intensive secretion of digestive enzymes produced by isoprenaline injection. No adenyl cyclase was detected in parotid saliva obtained by cannulation of the duct. The proteins which were secreted represented half of the total protein in the gland. Fractionation of the gland homogenate showed that the largest proportion of adenyl cyclase activity was located in the 200 x g fraction, probably in cell membranes. There was no significant activity in the zymogen granules although these structures play a key role in the secretion process induced via cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. Various preparations of rat parotid adenyl cyclase and their properties are described. The insoluble membrane-bound enzyme system contained highly reactive sulfhydryl groups essential for activity. The enzyme was partially activated by norepinephrine and maximally activated by fluoride. Preliminary incubation with fluoride and Mg++, followed by extensive washing with buffer, gave a preparation which showed high activity without further addition of fluoride. In contrast, prior activation by norepinephrine was not maintained after washing of the enzyme with buffer. It is suggested that adenyl cyclase in higher animals is controlled by specific proteins which are coupled with the enzyme and inhibit its activity. The hormone, through binding to a specific site on the inhibitor, reversibly removes the inhibition. Fluoride appears to counteract the inhibition by a process which is not readily reversible."
https://openalex.org/W2091245060,Guinea pigs with a total deficiency of the fourth component of complement (C4) have been discovered. There was no evidence for the presence of a C4 inhibitor in the serum of these animals. Mating studies indicate that C4 deficiency is transmitted as a simple autosomal recessive trait. A colony of these animals is being established at the National Institutes of Health. They will provide an opportunity to more precisely define the role of complement in immune phenomena and the defense against disease.

https://openalex.org/W1566790925,"Abstract The formylation of formyl-accepting methionyl transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNAfmet) was investigated in Streptococcus faecalis R, an organism incapable of synthesizing folic acid but whose growth does not require the vitamin under defined conditions of culture. These studies were carried out because it was not clear how an organism with no folate could initiate protein biosynthesis. Growth of S. faecalis R on media free of folate but containing serine, methionine, thymine, adenine, and guanine was not affected by the presence of the folate antagonists, trimethoprim and aminopterin. However, growth of the organism on media lacking thymine and dependent upon the presence of either folic acid or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate was severely inhibited by the analogues. It was demonstrated that extracts prepared from S. faecalis R grown on a synthetic medium containing folic acid catalyzed the formylation of methionyl-tRNAfmet when either 10-formyltetrahydrofolate or formate was added as the source of the formyl group, whereas extracts prepared from cells of this organism grown on a medium free of folate but containing serine, methionine, thymine, adenine, and guanine catalyzed the formation of methionyl-tRNAfmet only when 10-formyltetrahydrofolate but not when formate was used as the source of the formyl group. Extracts of these folate-free cells catalyzed the formylation of methionyl-tRNAfmet by formate if tetrahydrofolate was added to the assay mixture. These results indicate that S. faecalis R grown in the absence of folate but in the presence of the supplements does not contain tetrahydrofolate and therefore formylated methionyl-tRNAfmet may not be involved in initiation of protein synthesis in S. faecalis R, or the formylmethionyl ester of tRNAfmet (fMet-tRNAfmet) may be formed by some as yet unknown enzyme system."

Products of microbial degradation of other diphenylmethanes were also identified. Substituents on the methylene-carbon and para-chloro substitution are critical factors governing resistance of DDT and related compounds to aerobic metabolism and decomposition by the bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W1549116277,"Abstract Glycerol dehydrase, a coenzyme B12-dependent enzyme, from Aerobacter aerogenes, has been purified to a stable, inactive, homogeneous complex with hydroxocobalamin. The inactive complex can be converted to the active holoenzyme by replacement of hydroxocobalamin with coenzyme B12 in the presence of Mg++ and SO3=. The molecular weight of the hydroxocobalamin apoenzyme complex is 188,000 and 1 mole of hydroxocobalamin is bound to 1 mole of the apoenzyme. There is a significant difference between the spectra of the dissociated and the protein-bound hydroxocobalamin. The greater stability of the protein hydroxocobalamin complex as compared to the apoenzyme was shown by various methods. Complete dissociation of the apoenzyme is caused by low pH, Na+, or EDTA, whereas the hydroxocobalamin apoenzyme complex does not dissociate under the same conditions. EDTA markedly inhibits the activity of the enzyme whereas other chelating agents have little or no inhibitory effect. Partial reversal of the inhibitory effect of EDTA is achieved by increased concentrations of glycerol or by adding an excess of either subunit, A or B. The experimental evidence suggests that the effect of EDTA on the apoenzyme does not involve a divalent cation."

https://openalex.org/W1511612206,"Abstract A cell-free extract of Escherichia coli was induced by DNAs, prepared from various bacteriophages, to synthesize deoxycytidylate deaminase in vitro. With T4 DNA, only low levels of dCMP deaminase were synthesized. However, DNAs from two Bacillus subtilis bacteriophages, SP82 and SP5C, furnished very active templates for dCMP deaminase synthesis in the E. coli system. Each of these phages induces dCMP deaminase during infection of B. subtilis in vivo. Conversely, DNA from the B. subtilis bacteriophage SP3, which poorly induces dCMP deaminase in vivo, did not produce a dCMP deaminase synthesis in vitro. The synthesis of dCMP deaminase was shown to depend on both transcription and translation."
https://openalex.org/W1516709514,A mutant erythrocyte B type carbonic anhydrase has been found in a Caucasian. The isozyme was isolated in crystalline form and various of its properties were explored. It was similar in electrophoretic properties to the P isozyme previously found in pooled erythrocytes of normal individuals. It differs from the normal B and P isozymes in that 1 aspartic acid residue is substituted by valine. This variation was localized to a chymotryptic undecapeptide whose sequence was determined.

The system found insulin levels in the Old World primates rhesus and chimpanzee which were quite like those of human beings. The findings suggest important structural differences in the insulins of the two primate divisions.

https://openalex.org/W1517767443,"Abstract Cytochrome c was reduced by ferrous EDTA over the pH range 0.7 to 5.5, but not by ferrous ions alone. A typical hemochromogen of the low spin type was observed between pH 2.2 and 5.5, but spectra of the high spin type were seen between pH 0.7 and 2.1. CO-Ferrocytochrome c was obtained over the pH range of 1.6 to 3.2 by this method. The spectrum was similar to that of alkaline CO-ferrocytochrome c and two bands in the Soret region were observed at 392 and 413 mµ. o-Phenanthroline, α,α'-dipyridyl, 8-hydroxyquinoline, or amino acids could not be substituted for EDTA for the reduction of cytochrome c at acid pH. At neutral pH, cytochrome c was fully reduced by a 2-fold molar excess of ferrous ions in the absence of EDTA."

https://openalex.org/W133494810,"Abstract Guinea pig serum l-asparaginase was purified approximately 3000-fold by fractionation with sodium sulfate, precipitation with methanol, chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column, continuous free flow electrophoresis, and electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel. The purified enzyme was obtained in an over-all yield of 7%. The enzyme protein appeared as a single pure component on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, and immunodiffusion. Guinea pig liver l-asparaginase was converted into the guinea pig serum type l-asparaginase by digestion with papain. The specific activity of the papain-digested liver l-asparaginase was, after purification by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography and electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel, essentially the same as that of the 3000-fold purified serum l-asparaginase. There was no quantitative difference in the tumor inhibitory action between the papain-digested asparaginase and guinea pig serum l-asparaginase. The elution patterns on DEAE-cellulose columns and the mobilities on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were identical for the two enzymes, and a reaction of identity was obtained on immunodiffusion. A positive glycoprotein stain reaction was observed for both enzymes following the electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel. Despite the similarity, the papain-digested liver l-asparaginase and the serum l-asparaginase were found to be not completely identical. The nonequivalence was indicated by slight differences in amino acid composition and also by different electrophoretic mobilities in agar gel."

https://openalex.org/W1995290542,"MORRIS1 has stated that “In subnormality hospitals … most patients, once admitted, will never leave.” In the past this was true, but the present trend is for subnormal individuals to remain at home, adequately supported by appropriate services, for as long as possible. Moreover, it has been shown that 10 per cent or less2 of populations of subnormality hospitals require “detailed specialist day to day diagnosis, care and treatment”3. 80 per cent of severely subnormal children now remain at home4. One of the services which can extend the time for which families can tolerate a mentally handicapped dependant at home is periodic short term care in hospital. Of all admissions to mental subnormality hospitals and units in England and Wales, 48 per cent in 1964 and 60 per cent in 1966 were for informal short term care, usually for eight weeks or less5. We present here a short account of a study aimed at discovering whether the same factors determine short term and long term care for children and fulfil the same needs."
