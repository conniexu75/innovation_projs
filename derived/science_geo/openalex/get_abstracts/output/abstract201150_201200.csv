https://openalex.org/W2084571894,"THE determination of nitrogen in organic substances has been performed by either of the well-established methods, namely, one attributed to Dumas or the other first described by Kjeldahl. These methods require approximately 300 µgm. of nitrogen for accurate determination. The method to be described requires much less material, and compares favourably in accuracy with these standard methods. The sample is decomposed by digestion in sulphuric acid, and the ammonia is determined quantitatively by means of indanetrione hydrate."

Although these first parasitic stages have been studied in hanging drops in more than 200 media designed to imitate environmental factors to which parasites are presumably exposed in the body of the host no success has been obtained”."

https://openalex.org/W2008299583,"Vibrio fetus infection is an important cause of infertility in cattle throughout the world. Little is known of the pathogenesis of this disease, partly because of the difficulty of obtaining massive growth of the vibrio in vitro. The recent development in this laboratory of a method of obtaining satisfactory yields of cells1 has enabled fractionation studies on Vibrio fetus to be undertaken."

https://openalex.org/W2003137071,"FOR many purposes, such as tracing networks of neural structure in the brain, a normal microscope has the serious limitation that only a thin layer of the specimen can be studied at one time, owing to the limited depth of focus of microscope objectives. When a thin section is examined, only those structures which happen to lie in the plane of the section can be observed. This plane may be confused by such objects as fibres coming away from or toward the plane of the section. A microscope which gave a large depth of field, and which presented the image as a solid in a luminous block in which the structures could be observed in depth would have important advantages over existing optical microscopes. We have designed and constructed a primitive prototype of an instrument giving such a ‘solid image’. It is possible to observe this from any position and to see the structures with appropriate parallax."

https://openalex.org/W2035620280,"DURING the course of an investigation1 into the function and life-cycle of lymphocytes, a number of physical techniques were employed to determine the identity of cells isolated from various sources, for example, lymph glands, thoracic duct, thymus, spleen, blood, etc. The average cytoplasmic refractive index of small lymphocytes obtained from the above sites had been determined with a fair degree of certainty. It was noted that in chronically infected rats (rat pneumonia) the small lymphocytes, whatever their source, showed a significantly raised cytoplasmic refractive index. The subcutaneous injection of a particulate antigen (T.A.B.) produced a similar rise preceding but paralleling the rise in the antibody titre of the serum and thoracic duct lymph. We suggest that the refractive index change in the cytoplasm of the small lymphocyte is due to increased protein concentration connected with the mechanism of production of antibodies. A detailed study of this phenomenon is in progress."

https://openalex.org/W2014374692,A SIMPLE micro-stirrer has been developed for micro-analyses involving quantities of fluid varying from 1 ml. down to small drops of fluid which are titrated on waxed slides. Its main advantages over previous methods of micro-stirring are that it is cheap and relatively simple to make and can be controlled to give almost instantaneous even mixing without splashing or bubbling. It is therefore particularly suitable for continuous stirring while performing potentiometric or colorimetric titrations.

https://openalex.org/W2092742577,"IT has been known for many years1 that a close connexion exists between pantothenic acid and the suprarenal glands, atrophy of which may result from a deficiency of pantothenic acid. More recently, Hurley and Morgan2, arguing that animals in the final stages of pantothenic acid deficiency should behave as though adrenalectomized, showed that rats on such a diet were less resistant to the stress of anoxia than were normal controls."

https://openalex.org/W2057954493,"IN a previous study on the nucleotide metabolism of cardiac muscle1, the changes of adenosine triphosphate were investigated during systole and diastole. Using the Cohn and Carter method of analysis2 on a ‘Dowex-1’ column, the nucleotides were separated and determined quantitatively by ultra-violet absorption spectrophotometry. During the studies on the extracts of hearts frozen in systole by an acetone–dry ice mixture, a substance appeared as a new peak in the chromatogram, which seemed to be an adenine nucleotide with more nitrogens than could be accounted for. This was called nucleotide H."
https://openalex.org/W2029594914,"THE plant materials examined during this work were acetone powders prepared from lentils (Lens esculenta, Moench), ‘horse’ beans (Vicia faba, L.), lupin seeds (Lupinus termis, Forsk) and fenugreek seeds (Trigonella foenum-graecum, L.). Each acetone powder was extracted separately with 0.1 N borax–phthalate buffer at pH 8.0, the proportion being 10 gm. of acetone powder to 60 ml. of buffer. Extracts obtained in this way were subjected to paper electrophoresis on Whatman No. 1 filter paper in a Shandon horizontal tank. Borax–phthalate buffer, which was prepared by mixing 0.1 N borax and 0.1 N potassium hydrogen phthalate (pH 8.0), was used. A potential of 150 V. was applied for 12 hr. The protein bands were dyed with azocarmine B solution according to Turba and Enenkel's method3."

It is of irregular, blotchy shape and persists for 1–2 sec."
https://openalex.org/W2077808214,JOLLY1 described how to obtain a convenient number of erythroblastic mitoses in the circulating blood of various species of Triturus. The new techniques now made available by phase-contrast microscopy induced us to study these cells with time-lapse photography and micro-cinematography in order to obtain direct evidence of the mechanism of normal and artificially influenced mitosis.

Among the exceptions are Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) and the ‘Human C’ Streptococcus (group C), which are differentiated with reliability only by Lancefield's serological technique1. Wilson and Rosenblum2 showed that 477 cultures of S. pyogenes failed to multiply in raw milk sterilized with ethylene oxide while 31 cultures of group C Streptococci, of which at least 11 were ‘Human C’, always grew well in this medium. Recently, Levinson and Frank3 have published a method utilizing bacitracin for the differentiation of group A Streptococci. Approximately 10 per cent of their 67 group C strains were not differentiated. They mention the possibility of resistant group A strains emerging as a result of the clinical use of bacitracin. Since S. pyogenes and ‘Human C’ Streptococci are not readily distinguished biochemically by any single test or combinations of such tests1,4 in present use, a medium and method of differentiating them are of interest."
