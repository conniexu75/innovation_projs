https://openalex.org/W4294796715,"Abstract Overexpression of MYC is a genuine cancer driver in lymphomas and related to poor prognosis. However, therapeutic targeting of the transcription factor MYC remains challenging. Here, we show that inhibition of the histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) using the HDAC6 inhibitor Marbostat-100 (M-100) reduces oncogenic MYC levels and prevents lymphomagenesis in a mouse model of MYC -induced aggressive B-cell lymphoma. M-100 specifically alters protein-protein interactions by switching the acetylation state of HDAC6 substrates, such as tubulin. Tubulin facilitates nuclear import of MYC, and MYC-dependent B-cell lymphoma cells rely on continuous import of MYC due to its high turn-over. Acetylation of tubulin impairs this mechanism and enables proteasomal degradation of MYC. M-100 targets almost exclusively B-cell lymphoma cells with high levels of MYC whereas non-tumor cells are not affected. M-100 induces massive apoptosis in human and murine MYC -overexpressing B-cell lymphoma cells. We identified the heat-shock protein DNAJA3 as an interactor of tubulin in an acetylation-dependent manner and overexpression of DNAJA3 resulted in a pronounced degradation of MYC. We propose a mechanism by which DNAJA3 associates with hyperacetylated tubulin in the cytoplasm to control MYC turnover. Taken together, our data demonstrate a beneficial role of HDAC6 inhibition in MYC-dependent B-cell lymphoma."
https://openalex.org/W4294884110,"Believing in conspiracy theories is a major problem, especially in the face of a pandemic, as these constitute a significant obstacle to public health policies, like the use of masks and vaccination. Indeed, during the COVID-19 pandemic, several ungrounded explanations regarding the origin of the virus or the effects of vaccinations have been rising, leading to vaccination hesitancy or refusal which poses as a threat to public health. Recent studies have shown that in the core of conspiracy theories lies a moral evaluation component; one that triggers a moral reasoning which reinforces the conspiracy itself. To gain a better understanding of how conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 affect public health containment behaviors and policy support via morality-relevant variables, we analysed comprehensive data from the International Collaboration on the Social &amp; Moral Psychology (ICSMP) of COVID-19, consisting of 49.965 participants across 67 countries. We particularly explored the mediating role of two levels of morality: individual and group-based morality. Results show that believing in conspiracy theories reduces adoption of containment health-related behaviors and policy support of public health measures, but moral identity and morality-as-cooperation significantly mediate this relationship. This means that beliefs in conspiracy theories do not simply constitute antecedents of cognitive biases or failures, nor maladaptive behaviors based on personality traits, but are morally infused and should be dealt as such. Based on our findings, we further discuss the psychological, moral, and political implications of endorsement of conspiracy theories in the era of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4294844044,"Lung cancer (LC) represents most of the cancer incidences in the world. There are many types of LC, but Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common type. Although RNA-seq and microarray data provide a vast amount of gene expression data, most of the genes are insignificant to clinical diagnosis. Feature selection (FS) techniques overcome the high dimensionality and sparsity issues of the large-scale data. We propose a framework that applies an ensemble of feature selection techniques to identify genes highly correlated to LUAD. Utilizing LUAD RNA-seq data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we employed mutual information (MI) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) feature selection techniques along with support vector machine (SVM) classification model. We have also utilized Random Forest (RF) as an embedded FS technique. The results were integrated and candidate biomarker genes across all techniques were identified. The proposed framework has identified 12 potential biomarkers that are highly correlated with different LC types, especially LUAD. A predictive model has been trained utilizing the identified biomarker expression profiling and performance of 97.99% was achieved. In addition, upon performing differential gene expression analysis, we could find that all 12 genes were significantly differentially expressed between normal and LUAD tissues, and strongly correlated with LUAD according to previous reports. We here propose that using multiple feature selection methods effectively reduces the number of identified biomarkers and directly affects their biological relevance."
https://openalex.org/W4294795751,"The present study aimed to examine the capability of Clonostachys rosea isolates as a biological control agent against grapevine trunk diseases pathogens. Five C. rosea and 174 pathogenic fungal strains were isolated from grafted grapevines and subjected to in vitro confrontation tests. Efficient antagonism was observed against Eutypa lata and Phaeomoniella chlamydospora while mycoparasitism was observed to the pathogens of Botryosphaeria dothidea and Diaporthe spp. pathogens in in vitro dual culture assays. The conidia production of the C. rosea isolates were also measured on PDA plates. One isolate (19B/1) with high antagonistic capabilities and efficient conidia production was selected for in planta confrontation tests by mixing its conidia with the soil of Cabernet sauvignon grapevine cuttings artificially infected with B. dothidea, E. lata and P. chlamydospora. The length and/or the incidence of necrotic lesions caused by E. lata and P. chlamydospora at the inoculation point were significantly decreased after a three months incubation in the greenhouse on cuttings planted in soils inoculated with the conidia of strain 19B/1, while symptom incidence and severity were unaffected in the case of the pathogen B. dothidea. Based on the above results, we consider C. rosea a promising biological control agent against some grapevine trunk diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4294798041,"Promoting the growth of plants and improving plant stress-resistance by plant growth-promoting microorganism increasingly become a hotpot. While, most researchers focus on their supply role of nutrition or plant hormone. In this study, a novel mechanism that phosphate solubilizing microorganisms promoted plant growth under saline-alkali stress through secretion of organic acids, was proposed. The effects of desulfurization gypsum, humic acid, organic fertilizer and phosphate-solubilizing microorganism Penicillium funicuiosum P1 (KX400570) on the growth of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa cv. Longli 1), showed that the survival rate, stem length and dry weight of quinoa treated with P1 were 2.5, 1.5, 1 and 1.5 times higher than those of sterile water (CK) under severe saline-alkali stress. The growth-promoting effect of P1 on quinoa was much better than that of other treatment groups. In addition, P1 promoted the growth of quinoa because the organic acids (malic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, etc.) from P1 stimulated the antioxidant system and promote the photosynthesis of quinoa, further promote quinoa growth."
https://openalex.org/W4294904199,"The liver is an essential multifunctional organ and constantly communicates with nearly all the tissues in the body. Spaceflight or simulated microgravity has a significant impact on the livers of rodent models, including lipid accumulation and inflammatory cell infiltration. Whether similar liver lipotoxicity could occur in humans is not known, even though altered circulating cholesterol profile has been reported in astronauts. Using a 42-day head-down bed rest (HDBR) model in rhesus macaques, the present study investigated whether simulated microgravity alters the liver of non-human primates at the transcriptome and metabolome levels. Its association with stress and intestinal changes was also explored. Compared to the controls, the HDBR monkeys showed mild liver injury, elevated ANGPTL3 level in the plasma, and accumulation of fat vacuoles and inflammatory cells in the liver. Altered transcriptome signatures with up-regulation of genes in lipid metabolisms and down-regulation of genes in innate immune defense were also found in HDBR group-derived liver samples. The metabolic profiling of the liver revealed mildly disturbed fatty acid metabolism in the liver of HDBR monkeys. The intestinal dysbiosis, its associated endotoxemia and changes in the composition of bile acids, and elevated stress hormone in HDBR monkeys may contribute to the altered lipid metabolisms in the liver. These data indicate that liver metabolic functions and gut-liver axis should be closely monitored in prolonged spaceflight to facilitate strategy design to improve and maintain metabolic homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W4294653635,"Specific DNA methylation at CpG and non-CpG sites is essential for chromatin regulation. The DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A interacts with target sites surrounded by variable DNA sequences with its TRD and RD loops, but the functional necessity of these interactions is unclear. We investigated CpG and non-CpG methylation in a randomized sequence context using WT DNMT3A and several DNMT3A variants containing mutations at DNA-interacting residues. Our data revealed that the flanking sequence of target sites between the −2 and up to the +8 position modulates methylation rates >100-fold. Non-CpG methylation flanking preferences were even stronger and favor C(+1). R836 and N838 in concert mediate recognition of the CpG guanine. R836 changes its conformation in a flanking sequence-dependent manner and either contacts the CpG guanine or the +1/+2 flank, thereby coupling the interaction with both sequence elements. R836 suppresses activity at CNT sites but supports methylation of CAC substrates, the preferred target for non-CpG methylation of DNMT3A in cells. N838 helps to balance this effect and prevent the preference for C(+1) from becoming too strong. Surprisingly, we found L883 reduces DNMT3A activity despite being highly conserved in evolution. However, mutations at L883 disrupt the DNMT3A-specific DNA interactions of the RD loop, leading to altered flanking sequence preferences. Similar effects occur after the R882H mutation in cancer cells.

The catalytically inactive DNMT3-like protein (DNMT3L) has an important regulatory role in gametogenesis by acting as a stimulator of DNMT3A (6Gowher H. Jeltsch A.

The catalytically active C-terminal domain of DNMT3A (DNMT3AC) forms a linear heterotetrameric complex with the C-terminal domain of DNMT3L (DNMT3LC) in a 3L-3A-3A-3L arrangement (Fig. 1A) (12Jia D.

Biochemical studies showed that the DNMT3L subunits in the DNMT3A/3L heterotetramer can be replaced by two additional subunits of DNMT3AC (13Jurkowska R.Z. Anspach N. Urbanke C. Jia D. Reinhardt R.

Structures of the DNMT3A/3L complex bound to DNA showed that these subunits interact with two CpG sites in 12 base pair distance and methylate them in opposite DNA strands (15Zhang Z.M. Lu R. Wang P.

Among them, residues in the TRD and RD loops form an interconnected network of contacts with the DNA which mediates recognition of the CpG guanine and of the flanking sequence in the 3′ direction (Fig. 1A). DNMT3A and DNMT3B interact with the CpG guanine with residues from the TRD loop and they prefer methylation of DNA within CpG sites, but they also introduce methylation at lower level at non-CpG sites (19Jeltsch A.

Non-CpG methylation has been connected with gene regulatory and chromatin modulating functions and to X-chromosome inactivation mainly in the nervous system (2He Y. Ecker J.R.

Biol. 2021; 433167186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Differences in flanking sequence preferences of DNMT3A and DNMT3B could be connected to sequence and structural differences in the RD loops of both enzymes (18Gao L. Emperle M. Guo Y. Grimm S.A.

Biol. 2022; 434167482Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Moreover, R882H was shown to increase the stability of the RD interface which explains its dominant cellular phenotype (24Mack A. Emperle M. Schnee P. Adam S. Pleiss J. Bashtrykov P. et al.Preferential self-interaction of DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A subunits containing the R882H cancer mutation leads to dominant changes of flanking sequence preferences.J. Mol. Biol. 2022; 434167482Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Structural studies have documented the involvement of several amino acid residues from the TRD and RD loops in the DNA interaction of DNMT3A (Fig. 1B). In a CGT structure (15Zhang Z.M. Lu R. Wang P. Yu Y. Chen D. Gao L. et al.Structural basis for DNMT3A-mediated de novo DNA methylation.Nature. 2018; 554: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the R836 side-chain from the TRD loop forms an H-bond with the O6 of the CpG guanine plus one additional water-mediated contact to the guanine N7. However, in a CGA structure (16Anteneh H. Fang J. Song J. Structural basis for impairment of DNA methylation by the DNMT3A R882H mutation.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the R836 side chain moved up and it formed a side-chain H-bond to the N6 atom of the adenine in the +1 flanking position, A(+1), and a second H-bond to the +2 flank site, indicating flexible and combined readout of CpG specificity and the +1/+2 flank. In the CGA structure, the side chain of N838 contacts the O6 of the CpG guanine, while in the CGT structure, this residue is flipped up and it forms an H-bond to the phosphodiester group connecting the +2 and +3 flanking site and a direct contact to the +2′ base (where ‘ refers to the non-target DNA strand). Interestingly, the CpG recognition pattern in the CGA structure of DNMT3A resembles the structure of DNMT3B, where N779 (corresponding to N838 of DNMT3A) mediates the CpG guanine recognition. In both DNMT3A structures, the N7 atom of the CpG guanine is bound with a water-mediated H-bond to T834, a corresponding contact is also observed in DNMT3B. Moreover, S837 from the TRD loop forms a side chain H-bond to the N7 of G(+3’) in both DNMT3A structures, thereby directly contacting the +3 flank. The RD loop residues of DNMT3A are engaged in several contacts to the flanking residues at the 3′ side of the CpG (Fig. 1C). S881 and R887 form side chain H-bonds to the phosphodiester group between the flanking bases at +5′ and +6’. R882 contacts the phosphodiester group between the flanking bases at +3′ and +4’. L883 is sandwiched between S837 and the DNA backbone at the +4′ and +5′ flanking bases with multiple van-der-Waals contacts and a backbone H-bond to the phosphodiester group at this site. The TRD and RD loops are directly connected by the positioning of R836, which pushes R882 away from the DNA in its uplifted conformation (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the R882 side chain contacts the side chain of S837 in both structures. While structural studies document the dependence of the dynamic DNA interaction networks of DNMT3A on the flanking sequences of the CpG site, the functional relevance of this context-dependent DNA recognition has not been investigated. It was the aim of this study to unravel the functional consequences of the interconnected recognition of the CpG guanine, the +1 to +3 flanking sequences and flanking sequences further away from the CpG site and determine their effects in CpG and non-CpG methylation. To this end, several mutants of critical residues in DNMT3A were prepared and their activity, CpG specificity, and flanking preference in CpG and non-CpG context were determined in Deep Enzymology experiments. Our data provide a comprehensive view on the dynamic interaction of DNMT3A with the CpG sites and the 3′ flanking sequences, which defines the roles of individual amino acids residues in this contact network and their interdependence. To investigate the interaction of the catalytic domain of DNMT3A with the target CpG guanine and the 3′ flanking DNA, seven DNMT3A residues in the TRD and RD loop were selected from the available structures (15Zhang Z.M.

Song J. Structural basis for impairment of DNA methylation by the DNMT3A R882H mutation.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and mutated to alanine, viz. R836, S837, N838, S881, R882, L883, and R887. The cancer mutant R882H was investigated as well because of its medical relevance. A multiple sequence alignment of DNMT3A and DNMT3B enzymes from several vertebrate species and DNMT3 from amphioxus and sea urchin as representatives of nonvertebrates (Fig. 1D) showed that all these residues are fully conserved in DNMT3A enzymes, which is matching their putative highly important mechanistic role. However, there are strong differences in these residues between DNMT3A and DNMT3B. In the TRD loop, R836 is replaced by K777 (using human DNMT3B numbering) in most of the DNMT3B sequences, and the RD loop is one of the most divergent regions of DNMT3A and DNMT3B, where the DNMT3A residues S881-R882-L883-…-R887 are replaced by G822-R823-G824 and K828 in DNMT3B. DNMT3A catalytic domain mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, overexpressed, and purified as maltose binding protein (MBP)-tagged proteins. All mutants were obtained at comparable purity (Fig. S1). Protein concentrations were determined by A280nm and validated on Coomassie BB-stained polyacrylamide gels. Methylation activity was initially determined using radioactively-labeled AdoMet and a biotinylated double-stranded 30-mer oligonucleotide substrate with a single CpG site that has been employed as reference substrate in several previous studies (24Mack A. Emperle M. Schnee P. Adam S. Pleiss J. Bashtrykov P. et al.Preferential self-interaction of DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A subunits containing the R882H cancer mutation leads to dominant changes of flanking sequence preferences.J. Mol.

Initial reaction rates were calculated from time courses of the methylation reactions and averaged over several (3–6) independent experimental repeats (blue bars in Fig. 1E). The results revealed a striking five-fold enhancement of activity for L883A, slight reductions in activity of R836A and R882H, and a stronger reduction of activity in the case of R882A. The catalytic activities of N838A, S837A, S881A, and R887A were similar to the DNMT3A wildtype (WT) activity. To explore the flanking sequence preferences of CpG methylation by DNMT3A WT and the mutants, we next conducted Deep Enzymology experiments (19Jeltsch A. Adam S. Dukatz M. Emperle M. Bashtrykov P. Deep enzymology studies on DNA methyltransferases reveal novel connections between flanking sequences and enzyme activity.J. Mol. Biol. 2021; 433167186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We first investigated the methylation of a pool of DNA substrates, in which a target CpG site was flanked by 10 random nucleotides on either side. The substrate pool was methylated by DNMT3A WT and mutants, followed by hairpin ligation, bisulfite conversion, PCR amplification, and next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis as described previously (18Gao L. Emperle M. Guo Y. Grimm S.A. Ren W. Adam S. et al.Comprehensive structure-function characterization of DNMT3B and DNMT3A reveals distinctive de novo DNA methylation mechanisms.Nat.

In each case, two independent experiments were conducted as detailed in Table S1. R882H CpG methylation data were used from our previous publication (22Emperle M. Adam S. Kunert S. Dukatz M. Baude A. Plass C. et al.Mutations of R882 change flanking sequence preferences of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and cellular methylation patterns.Nucl.

To exclude effects of the fixed sequences outside of the randomized region, the following analyses were restricted to the −8 to +8 region, which then still have two random nucleotides on both sides. Using these data sets, we determined the average methylation levels of all substrates containing a particular base at one of the −8 to +8 flank sites to identify bases favorable or unfavorable for methylation activity. The data were expressed in observed/expected ratios of the corresponding base in the methylated DNA strands. We first compared the results of the experimental repeats conducted with each mutant, which always showed high correlation of the derived profiles, which was also the case for the WT data determined here and previously (18Gao L. Emperle M. Guo Y. Grimm S.A. Ren W. Adam S. et al.Comprehensive structure-function characterization of DNMT3B and DNMT3A reveals distinctive de novo DNA methylation mechanisms.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Table S2). In general, the average methylation activities determined in the Deep Enzymology experiments were similar to the radioactive methylation rates of the respective mutant (orange bars in Fig. 1E). Most strikingly, the rate enhancement with L883A seen in the radioactive kinetics was observed in the NGS assay as well. Detailed analysis of the flanking sequence preferences revealed strong position and mutant specific effects. DNMT3A WT flanking effects were detectable between the −2 and (mainly) +6 positions (Fig. 2A). At the −2 site, T was strongly preferred, while G and A were disfavored. C and A were preferred at −1, where T was most disfavored. At +1 to +3, C was strongly preferred (in addition to A at +3) and G was disfavored. Weaker effects were detectable at +4 (preference for C) and +6 (preference for T and disfavor for G). Due to the limited number of reads, average methylation levels could only be determined for all NNCGNNN flanks. The numbers varied between 95% methylation for TCCGCCC and no detectable methylation for 11 NNCGNNN sequence motifs that were all very G-rich, illustrating the strong effect of the flanking sequences on DNMT3A activity in agreement with previous data (18Gao L. Emperle M. Guo Y. Grimm S.A. Ren W. Adam S. et al.Comprehensive structure-function characterization of DNMT3B and DNMT3A reveals distinctive de novo DNA methylation mechanisms.Nat.

Biol. 2022; 434167482Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To identify the flanking base pairs most relevant for the catalytic activity, the RMSD value for the deviation of the occurrence of each base from the expected value (obs/exp = 1.0) was determined for each position. The RMSD values of WT and mutant profiles showed effects between the −2 and +7 flanking sites (Fig. 2B). Strong overall flanking sequence preferences were observed with R836A, N838A, R882A, and R882H, while effects at S837A, S881A, L883A, and R887A were smaller. Largest effects were observed at the −2 and +1 sites, the largest difference between DNMT3A and DNMT3B profiles (18Gao L. Emperle M. Guo Y. Grimm S.A. Ren W. Adam S. et al.Comprehensive structure-function characterization of DNMT3B and DNMT3A reveals distinctive de novo DNA methylation mechanisms.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were observed at −1 and +1 sites. Detailed analyses of the mutant preferences were conducted for the −2 to +5 positions and compared with WT (Fig. 2C). R836A showed a strong change of preferences at the +1 site, where the preferences changed from C>T>A>G (WT) to T>C>A>>G, indicating that the disfavor for G was even more enhanced and the preferences for T and C swapped. In addition, the disfavor for G(+2) and G(+3) was reduced for R836A. In case of S837A, no big effects were observed, but at the +1 and +2 sites, the preferences of WT were enhanced and the preference for A(+3) was reduced. N838A led to strong changes in the flanking sequence preferences at the +1 position, where the preferences changed from C>T>A>G (WT) to C>T>>G∼A. In addition, the preference for C(+3) was reduced. S881A did not show big effects. R882A showed a strong elevation of WT effects at −1 and a strong shift of preferences at +1 toward G>A∼C>>T, indicating that the preference for G increased while T and C dropped. Moreover, the preference for G(+2) was increased as well. A similar change in preferences at the +1 and +2 sites as R882A was observed for R882H. In addition, the preference for A(+3) dropped. L883A also caused the same change in preferences at +1 as R882A and R882H and the drop of the A(+3) preference as observed for R882H. For R887A, a mild change of preferences at +4 was observed, where G and A were more preferred than by WT. In summary, these data reveal strong >100-fold flanking sequence preferences of DNMT3A that were heavily influenced by R836, N838, R882, and L883. To further compile the data and compare the deviations of the preferences of the DNMT3A mutants from the preference profiles of DNMT3A and DNMT3B (taken from (18Gao L. Emperle M. Guo Y. Grimm S.A. Ren W. Adam S. et al.Comprehensive structure-function characterization of DNMT3B and DNMT3A reveals distinctive de novo DNA methylation mechanisms.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)), the R-values of the correlation of −2 to +5 flanking profiles of mutants with DNMT3A and DNMT3B WT were determined and plotted, revealing several distinct groups of mutants (Fig. 2D). The R882A, R882H, and L883A mutants caused large and similar changes of the profile making them similar to DNMT3B. In contrast, R836A caused an equally large but different shift of preferences that does move it toward DNMT3B. R887A and N838A also caused distinct changes of flanking sequence preferences. Finally, S837A and S881A caused only weak effects and cluster together with WT DNMT3A. Next, we were interested to determine the combined readout of the base pairs at the +1 to +3 flank sites. To this end, the relative preferences of all 16 +2/+3 flank dinucleotides were determined for each given base at the +1 site, revealing several interesting combined effects with WT DNMT3A (Fig. 2E). For example: (1) T(+1) is favored in the +2/+3 context of AG, (2) A(+1) is favored in the +2/+3 context GA, GC, and GG but disfavored in combination with CG, and (3) C(+1) is favored in the TG and TT context. The corresponding patterns were determined for all mutants (Fig. S2) and the correlations of mutant dinucleotide preferences with the WT were determined (Fig. 2F). This analysis revealed that R882A by far showed the weakest correlation, which underscores the importance of R882 for the +1 to +3 flank interaction. The more conservative R882H exchange led to much smaller changes. Interestingly, the mutations in the TRD loop led to reduction of the correlation of +2/+3 flank preferences in the presence of A(+1), and in the case of R836A, also for G(+1). Finally,"

This situation worsens with the introduction of emerging, Zika fever and chikungunya fever, causing epidemics in several countries within the last decade. Hotspot analysis contributes to understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics in the context of co-circulation of these three arboviral diseases, which have the same vector: Aedes aegypti.To analyze the spatial distribution and agreement between the hotspots of the historical series of reported dengue cases from 2000 to 2014 and the Zika, chikungunya and dengue cases hotspots from 2015 to 2019 in the city of Rio de Janeiro.To identify hotspots, Gi* statistics were calculated for the annual incidence rates of reported cases of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya by neighborhood. Kendall's W statistic was used to analyze the agreement between diseases hotspots.There was no agreement between the hotspots of the dengue fever historical series (2000-2014) and those of the emerging Zika fever and chikungunya fever (2015-2019). However, there was agreement between hotspots of the three arboviral diseases between 2015 and 2019.The results of this study show the existence of persistent hotspots that need to be prioritized in public policies for the prevention and control of these diseases. The techniques used with data from epidemiological surveillance services can help in better understanding of the dynamics of these diseases wherever they circulate in the world."

This study investigated gene expression from skeletal muscle tissues of older healthy adults, who are at risk of age-related sarcopenia, to identify potential gene biomarkers whose dysregulated expression and protein interference were involved in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Screening of the literature resulted in 14 microarray datasets (GSE25941, GSE28392, GSE28422, GSE47881, GSE47969, GSE59880 in musculoskeletal ageing; GSE118370, GSE33532, GSE19804, GSE18842, GSE27262, GSE19188, GSE31210, GSE40791 in NSCLC). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were used to construct protein-protein interaction networks and retrieve clustering gene modules. Overlapping module DEGs were ranked based on 11 topological algorithms and were correlated with prognosis, tissue expression, and tumour purity in NSCLC. The analysis revealed that the dysregulated expression of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein S26 (MRPS26), Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein S17 (MRPS17), Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L18 (MRPL18) and Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L51 (MRPL51) were linked to reduced survival and tumour purity in NSCLC while tissue expression of the same genes followed an opposite direction in healthy older adults. These results support a potential link between the mitochondrial ribosomal microenvironment in ageing muscle and NSCLC. Further studies comparing changes in sarcopenia and NSCLC associated cachexia are warranted."

Diabetes mellitus is a common endocrinopathy in dogs; however, little is known about the composition of the gut microbiome during the development and treatment of diabetes in this species. The objective of this pilot study was to characterize the gastrointestinal microbiome of dogs with diabetes mellitus at the time of diagnosis and over the first 12 weeks of insulin therapy and identify associations with glycemic control. Rectal swabs and serum for fructosamine measurement were collected from 6 newly diagnosed diabetic dogs at 2-week intervals for 12 weeks. Rectal samples were sequenced using 16S, ITS, and archaeal primers. Measures of alpha and beta diversity were assessed for changes over time; associations between absolute sequence variant (ASV) relative abundances and time and fructosamine concentration were identified using a microbiome-specific, multivariate linear effects model. No statistically significant changes over time were noted in alpha diversity and samples significantly grouped by dog rather than by time in the beta diversity analysis. However, multiple ASVs were negatively (Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Romboutsia, Collinsella) and positively (Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus gauveauii, Peptoclostridium) associated with time and two ASVs were positively associated with fructosamine (Enterococcus, Escherichia-Shigella). These changes in gastrointestinal microbial composition warrant further investigation of how they may relate to diabetes mellitus progression or control in dogs."

In order to find ways to enhance senescence induction by palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor approved for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, we performed functional genetic screens in palbociclib-resistant cells. Using this approach, we found that loss of CDK2 results in strong senescence induction in palbociclib-treated cells. Treatment with the CDK2 inhibitor indisulam, which phenocopies genetic CDK2 inactivation, led to sustained senescence induction when combined with palbociclib in various cell lines and lung cancer xenografts. Treating cells with indisulam led to downregulation of cyclin H, which prevented CDK2 activation. Combined treatment with palbociclib and indisulam induced a senescence program and sensitized cells to senolytic therapy. Our data indicate that inhibition of CDK2 through indisulam treatment can enhance senescence induction by CDK4/6 inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W4294844200,"Advances in detection techniques and treatment have increased the diagnosis of breast cancer at early stages; however, recurrence occurs in all breast cancer subtypes, and both recurrent and de novo metastasis are typically treatment resistant. A growing body of evidence supports the notion that metabolic plasticity drives cancer recurrence. RON and DEK are proteins that promote cancer metastasis and synergize mechanistically to activate β-catenin, but the metabolic consequences are unknown.To ascertain RON-DEK-β-catenin dependent metabolic pathways, we utilized an NMR-based metabolomics approach to determine steady state levels of metabolites. We also interrogated altered metabolic pathway gene expression for prognostic capacity in breast cancer patient relapse-free and distant metastasis-free survival and discover a metabolic signature that is likely associated with recurrence.RON-DEK-β-catenin loss showed a consistent metabolite regulation of succinate and phosphocreatine. Consistent metabolite alterations between RON and DEK loss (but not β-catenin) were found in media glucose consumption, lactate secretion, acetate secretion, and intracellular glutamine and glutathione levels. Consistent metabolite alterations between RON and β-catenin loss (and not DEK) were found only in intracellular lactate levels. Further pathway hits include β-catenin include glycolysis, glycosylation, TCA cycle/anaplerosis, NAD+ production, and creatine dynamics. Genes in these pathways epistatic to RON-DEK-β-catenin were used to define a gene signature that prognosticates breast cancer patient survival and response to chemotherapy.The RON-DEK-β-catenin axis regulates the numerous metabolic pathways with significant associations to breast cancer patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4294917884,"Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorder in which pathogenesis has been shown to be in part the result of miRNA-mediated signaling. Here, we investigated the alleviatory role of miR-16 in IBS-D. First, we established an IBS-D mouse model using colonic instillation of acetic acid and developed an IBS-D cell model using lipopolysaccharide exposure. The experimental data demonstrated that miR-16 was underexpressed in the serum of IBS-D patients, as well as in the colorectal tissues of IBS-D mouse models and lipopolysaccharide-exposed intestinal epithelial cells. Next, miR-16 and TLR4 were overexpressed or inhibited to characterize their roles in the viability and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, inflammation, and epithelial tight junction. We found that miR-16 overexpression increased the viability of intestinal epithelial cells, maintained tight junction integrity, and inhibited cell apoptosis and inflammation. We showed that miR-16 targeted TLR4 and inhibited the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Additionally, inhibition of NF-κB suppressed the long noncoding RNA XIST, thereby promoting enterocyte viability, inhibiting apoptosis and cytokine production, and maintaining tight junction integrity. In vivo experiments further verified the alleviatory effect of miR-16 on IBS-D symptoms in mice. Taken together, we conclude that miR-16 downregulates XIST through the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, thereby relieving IBS-D. This study suggests that miR-16 may represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention against IBS-D."

While recent quantitative studies have noted high anxiety and depression in SCAD survivors, the full range and extent of psychosocial impacts of SCAD is unknown. The present study used a qualitative approach to investigate the psychosocial impacts of SCAD in Australian SCAD survivors. Focus group participants were recruited as part of a larger study of SCAD survivors currently being undertaken by the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute. Thirty SCAD survivors participated in one of seven online focus groups, conducted using a semi-structured format. Focus group duration was 1.5 hours. Each was digitally recorded and transcribed. Data were analyzed thematically according to recommended guidelines. One over-arching theme, five main themes and 26 sub-themes were identified. The over-arching theme related to lack of information, while the five main themes related to emotional impacts, issues with self-management, issues with family, impacts on work life, and the need for psychosocial support. The ‘emotional impacts’ theme comprised 11 sub-themes, namely shock and disbelief, confusion and uncertainty, unfairness, fear and anxiety, loss and grief, isolation and loneliness, guilt, invalidation and embarrassment, depression, vulnerability, and frustration. Findings are discussed in light of relevant psychological theories. This qualitative study extends previous quantitative investigations of SCAD survivors by providing an in-depth understanding of the complex, inter-related and highly distressing impacts of SCAD. The findings point to the urgent need for a coherent approach to information provision, the development and delivery of SCAD-specific cardiac rehabilitation programs, and the provision of psychosocial support programs for SCAD survivors."

Healthcare workers, particularly nurses, became the front-line fighters against the pandemic, making it imperative to comply with recommended safety protocols. However, many nurses were infected by the virus in the Tamale Metropolis, raising concerns regarding their level of adherence to the safety protocols. This study assessed the predictors of knowledge and adherence to COVID-19 safety protocols among nurses at selected health facilities in the Tamale Metropolis of northern Ghana.A facility based cross-sectional study design was adopted and 339 nurses from six (6) public health facilities in the Tamale Metropolis were recruited for the study using questionnaires. The questionnaires were transformed into Google Forms for respondents to answer online via WhatsApp or email. The data were exported from the Google spreadsheet into SPSS and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.Of the 339 participants, 60.2% were classified as having adequate knowledge while only 9.1% demonstrated high adherence to COVID-19 safety protocols. Knowledge of COVID-19 was predicted by source of information, and marital status, whereas health facility types predicted level of adherence. The odds of having adequate knowledge were higher among unmarried nurses (AOR = 1.94; 95% CI: 1.16-3.25; p = 0.012) and nurses using social media (AOR = 1.80; 95%CI 1.02-3.18; p = 0.042) compared to their counterparts.

We suggest that facility managers should enforce compliance of their staff to the safety protocols to prevent spread of the virus within healthcare settings."

To improve OHCA success rates, this study assessed the prognostic interactions resulting from simultaneously modifying two prehospital factors using a trained machine learning model.We enrolled 8274 OHCA patients resuscitated by emergency medical services (EMS) in Nara prefecture, Japan, with a unified activity protocol between January 2010 and December 2018; patients younger than 18 and those with noncardiogenic cardiopulmonary arrest were excluded. Next, a three-layer neural network model was constructed to predict the cerebral performance category score of 1 or 2 at one month based on 24 features of prehospital EMS activity. Using this model, we evaluated the prognostic impact of continuously and simultaneously varying the transport time and the defibrillation or drug-administration time in the test data based on heatmaps.The average class sensitivity of the prognostic model was more than 0.86, with a full area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.94 (95% confidence interval of 0.92-0.96). By adjusting the two time factors simultaneously, a nonlinear interaction was obtained between the two adjustments, instead of a linear prediction of the outcome.Modifications to the parameters using a machine-learning-based prognostic model indicated an interaction among the prognostic factors. These findings could be used to evaluate which factors should be prioritized to reduce time in the trained region of machine learning in order to improve EMS activities."

This study aimed to examine the association between contact with mental health and substance use treatment services, and reincarceration, among adults released from prison. Methods Pre-release survey data from 1,115 adults released from prisons in Queensland, Australia were linked with administrative health and correctional records covering a median of 787 days post-release. We constructed marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for pre-release variables and time-varying indicators of emergent mental health and substance use problems, to examine the association between contact with mental health and substance use treatment services, and reincarceration. Results The adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) for reincarceration associated with mental health service contact was 1.76 (95%CI 1.23,2.51). Among those not on parole following release, the AHR for reincarceration associated with substance use treatment service contact was 3.16 (95%CI 2.09,4.77); we found no evidence for an association among those who were released on parole (AHR = 1.07; 95%CI 0.80,1.43). Conclusions Although we cannot eliminate the possibility of residual confounding, our findings suggest that infrequent or unsustained contact with community-based mental health and substance use treatment services is not protective against reincarceration, and may even be iatrogenic. Increased investment in high-quality and timely behavioural health services for people released from prison may simultaneously improve health outcomes, and reduce reincarceration."

It is therefore both surprising and important that people can be even happier after spending money on someone else. We conducted a close replication of a key experiment from Dunn, Aknin, and Norton (2008) to verify and expand upon their findings. Participants were given money and randomly assigned to either spend it on themselves or on someone else. Although the original study (N = 46) found that the latter group was happier, when we used the same analysis in our replication (N = 133), we did not observe a significant difference. However, we report an additional analysis, focused on a more direct measure of happiness, that does show a significant effect in the direction of the original. Follow-up analyses shed new insights into people's predictions about their own and others' happiness and their actual happiness when spending money for themselves or others."

The present study investigated age-related differences in attention and temporal processing, as well as differences in the neural activity related to signal degradation during a number comparison task. Participants listened to digits presented in background babble and were tested at two levels of signal clarity, clear and degraded. Behavioral and electrophysiological measures were examined in 30 older and 20 younger neurologically-healthy adults. Relationships between performance on the number comparison task, behavioral measures, and neural activity were used to determine correlates of listening deficits associated with aging. While older participants showed poorer performance overall on all behavioral measures, their scores on the number comparison task were largely predicted (based on regression analyses) by their sensitivity to temporal fine structure cues. Compared to younger participants, older participants required higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) to achieve equivalent performance on the number comparison task. With increasing listening demands, age-related changes were observed in neural processing represented by the early-N1 and later-P3 time windows. Source localization analyses revealed age differences in source activity for the degraded listening condition that was located in the left prefrontal cortex. In addition, this source activity negatively correlated with task performance in the older group. Together, these results suggest that older adults exhibit reallocation of processing resources to complete a demanding listening task. However, this effect was evident only for poorer performing older adults who showed greater posterior to anterior shift in P3 response amplitudes than older adults who were good performers and younger adults. These findings might reflect less efficient recruitment of neural resources that is associated with aging during effortful listening performance."

Methylation-Sensitive High-Resolution Melting (MS-HRM) is a method used for measuring methylation changes and has already been used in diagnostic settings. This method utilizes one set of primers that initiate the amplification of both methylated and non-methylated templates. Therefore, the quantification of the methylation levels using MS-HRM is hampered by the PCR bias phenomenon. Some approaches have been proposed to calculate the methylation level of samples using the high-resolution melting (HRM) curves. However, limitations of the methylation calculation using MS-HRM have not been evaluated systematically and comprehensively. We used the Area Under the Curve (AUC), a derivative of the HRM curves, and least square approximation (LSA) to establish a procedure that allowed us to infer methylation levels in an MS-HRM experiment and assess the limitations of that procedure for the assays' specific methylation level measurement. The developed procedure allowed, with certain limitations, estimation of the methylation levels using HRM curves."

We also described the change of ASMR between two periods (2005-2010 vs. 2011-2017).There were 64,721 CD deaths between 2005 and 2017 (4.12% among all deaths). The absolute frequency of CD deaths was 5,665 and 6,565 in 2005 and 2017, respectively. CD mortality was more frequent in men and older adults. The ASMR varied among natural regions, being higher in the Coast (19.61 per 100,000 inhabitants). The change between the two periods revealed that almost all departments reduced their ASMRs, except for Callao, Lambayeque, and Madre de Dios.CD mortality has increased in Peru. Mortality was higher in men and older adults, and it varied among departments. More political efforts are needed to reduce these trends."

The purpose of this study was to investigate factors associated with anemia and the negative impact of anemia in female MG patients. We investigated factors related to MG and anemia in 215 female patients with MG, who were attending the MG clinic of Keio Hospital between January and December 2021. We statistically evaluated clinical factors related to anemia in patients with and without anemia. Eighty-five patients (40%) had anemia in the past, and 130 patients did not have anemia in the past. There were no significant differences in age at study, age at MG onset, body mass index, or frequency of autoantibodies between the anemia and non-anemia groups. MG severity evaluated by the MG Foundation of America classification was greater in the anemia group than in the non-anemia group. History of anemia was associated with immunosuppressive treatment, such as prednisolone and calcineurin inhibitor treatment. There was a correlation between hemoglobin levels and the MG-quality of life score. Long term immunosuppressive therapy can cause anemia in female MG patients. Anemia may negatively affect the quality of life of female MG patients."
https://openalex.org/W4294797984,"This study investigated the composition of mosquito species in different kinds of breeding sites in a tropical forest remnant of the Atlantic Forest and identified species of public health concern therein. Collections of immature forms of mosquitoes were carried out monthly at the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve in southeastern Brazil, between June 2014 and June 2015. Samples were collected from four types of breeding sites: bamboos, bromeliads, puddles, and a lake. A total of 1,182 specimens of mosquitoes belonging to 28 species and 13 genera were collected. Three species, Ad. squamipennis, An. neglectus, and Wy. arthrostigma represented 64.8% of the captured specimens. Only three species were found in more than one type of breeding site: Ps. ferox, An. triannulatus, and Tx. trichopygus. Two species of public health concern were found breeding in bamboo (Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus) and one in the lake (An. darlingi). Bamboo had the highest species richness, Shannon diversity, abundance of individuals and number of dominant species of all breeding sites. Similar Simpson diversity was obtained for bamboo and bromeliads, with higher values than those obtained for puddles and the lake. The significance of the four breeding sites, especially bamboos, is discussed in the context of controlling populations of sylvatic species of mosquitoes in Atlantic Forest areas."

This study aimed analyze the risk factors of the prognosis in sepsis patients.In this case-control study, patients with sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit of a Chinese hospital between January and November 2020 were analyzed. Ultrasound and clinical data were analyzed and compared between non-survivors and survivors. The ROC curve analysis was also performed to determine the best indicator for predicting mortality.A total of 72 patients with sepsis in ICU were included for analysis. The basic characteristics between the survivals and non-survivals were similar, except for acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) Ⅱ score, sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, lactate level, ultrasound parameters from superior mesenteric artery (SMA) such as peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV) and resistive index (RI). Univariate analysis revealed that the APACHE Ⅱ score, SOFA score, lactate, low PSV, EDV, and RI were potential risk factors for mortality in sepsis, while multivariate analysis suggested that low PSV was an independent risk factor for mortality, and the adjusted odds ratio was 0.295 (95% CI: 0.094-0.925). The ROC analysis showed that the PSV (AUC = 0.99; sensitivity and specificity were 0.99 and 0.96, respectively) had good predictive value for mortality in sepsis.Low PSV as found to be an independent risk factor and good predictor for mortality in patients with sepsis. This study shows the promise of ultrasound in predicting mortality in patients with sepsis; however, further studies are needed to validate these results."
https://openalex.org/W4294797997,"Plankton distributions are remarkably ‘patchy’ in the ocean. In this study, we investigated the contrasting phytoplankton-zooplankton distributions in relation to wind mixing events in waters around a biodiversity-rich island (Runde) located off the western coast of Norway. We used adaptive sampling from AUV and shipboard profiles of in-situ phytoplankton photo-physiology and particle identification (copepods, fecal pellets and the dinoflagellate Tripos spp.) and quantification using optical and imaging sensors. Additionally, traditional seawater and net sampling were collected for nutrient and in-vitro chlorophyll a concentrations and phytoplankton and meso-zooplankton abundances. Persistent strong wind conditions (~5 days) disrupted the stratification in offshore regions, while stratification and a subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) were observed above the base of the mixed layer depth (MLD ~30 m) in inshore waters. Contrasting phytoplankton and zooplankton abundances were observed between inshore (with the presence of a SCM) and offshore waters (without the presence of a SCM). At the SCM, phytoplankton abundances ( Tripos spp., the diatom Proboscia alata and other flagellates) were half (average of 200 cell L -1 ) of those observed offshore. On the contrary, meso-zooplankton counts were ~6× higher (732 ind m -3 for Calanus spp.) inshore (where a SCM was observed) compared to offshore areas. In parallel, fecal pellets and ammonium concentrations were high (&gt;1000 ind m -3 for the upper 20 m) at the SCM, suggesting that the shallow mixed layer might have increased encounter rates and promoted strong grazing pressure. Low nutrient concentrations (&lt; 1μM for nitrate) were found below the MLD (60 m) in offshore waters, suggesting that mixing and nutrient availability likely boosted phytoplankton abundances. The size of the absorption cross-section ( σ PII ’ ) and yield of photosystem II photochemistry under ambient light (φ PII ’ ) changed according to depth, while the depth-related electron flow ( J PII ) was similar between regions, suggesting a high degree of community plasticity to changes in the light regime. Our results emphasize the importance of using multiple instrumentation, in addition to traditional seawater and net sampling for a holistic understanding of plankton distributions."
https://openalex.org/W4294798040,"The Impulsive Behavior Short Scale–8 (I-8) measures the psychological construct of impulsivity with four subscales comprising two items each (completion time &lt; 1 min). The aim of the present study was threefold: (1) to assess the psychometric properties (objectivity, reliability, and validity) of the English-language I-8; (2) to compare these psychometric properties with those of the original German-language source version of the scale; and (3) to test the cross-national comparability of the scale via measurement invariance tests. For this purpose, we used heterogeneous quota samples from the UK and Germany. Our results indicate that I-8 is a reliable and valid short scale with highly comparable psychometric properties across both language versions. In addition, I-8 showed a highly similar correlational pattern with various extraneous variables across the two nations. Furthermore, partial scalar invariance and full invariance of residual variances held, allowing the comparison of latent means and observed (co)variances across nations. I-8 lends itself as a measure of impulsive behavior especially in surveys in which assessment time is limited, such as in large-scale cross-national surveys."
https://openalex.org/W4294798271,"Introduction Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus and is a significant cause of blindness worldwide. In Uganda, the prevalence of diabetes is approximately 2.7% of the urban population and 1% in rural areas. Many diabetics cannot access an eye exam due to the lack of less costly and user-friendly equipment that primary eye workers can use. Smartphone-based fundus photography allows for a cheap and mobile fundus examination. The study aimed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Portable Eye Examination Kit (PEEK) retina compared to a standard ophthalmic fundus camera (Zeiss Visucam 200) for the diagnosis of DR. Methods From January-March 2020, 286 people with diabetes (type 1 &amp; 2) patients were seen at Kiruddu National referral hospital diabetes clinic. All participants had funduscopy with PEEK retina and the standard ophthalmic fundus camera following ophthalmic examination and pupillary dilation. The PEEK retina’s sensitivity, specificity and reliability were determined using an ophthalmic fundus camera as the gold standard. Results The participants’ mean age was 51 with a standard deviation of ±11years, 213 (74.5%) were females, and the majority (93.4%) had Type 2 diabetes. The overall Sensitivity of PEEK retina for DR was 84% (95% CI 70.9–83.5), while the specificity was 79.9% (95% CI 76–83.5) with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 30.9% (95% CI 23.2–39.4) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 97.9% (95% CI 95.9–99.1). Conclusions PEEK retina has high sensitivity and specificity, making it suitable for screening and diagnostic purposes. Therefore, we recommend the integration of the PEEK retina in the screening and diagnosis of DR in resource-limited settings."

https://openalex.org/W4294843592,"Introduction Earlier studies have demonstrated that the oldest in a competition class are more likely to succeed than the youngest, a phenomenon called relative age effect (RAE). Track and field give us an opportunity to investigate the advantage of being born early in the year based upon actual performance, since objective criteria are the performance indicators. Hence, the aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of RAE in Norwegian track and field athletes in events where physical capacity is important for success. Methods All individual season best results from the register of The Norwegian Athletics Federation (n = 28 999) obtained in all competition classes from the age of 10 years to senior in both sexes on 60m and 600m from 2011 to 2020 were downloaded. One-way ANOVA and LSD post hoc analyses were used to analyze performance differences according to birth quartiles between athletes. Further, odds ratios (OR) were used to calculate the odds of being among the top-100 for athletes for those born in the first quartile of the year compared to the last. Results The RAE was present in several of the competition classes in sprint compared to middle-distance running, and in more male than female competition classes. Overall, the OR of being among the top-100 in one of the competition classes on 60m sprint when born in first quartile compared to last quartile was 2.88 [2.30–3.62] for males and 1.54 [1.26–1.89] for females. Conclusion Being born early in the year in events with high demand for specific physical capacities is an advantage in both sexes in most of the youngest competition classes. In males, the advantage of being born early in the year lasted longer in sprint than in middle-distance running, indicating that puberty affects performance in sprint and middle-distance running differently."
https://openalex.org/W4294843890,"It has been established that participants performing a continuous categorization task respond significantly slower following the presentation of unexpected, task-irrelevant, auditory stimuli, compared to a repetitive (standard) sound. Evidence indicates that such distraction emerges because of the violation of sensory predictions. This has typically been studied by measuring the impact of replacing the repeated sound by a different sound on rare and unpredictable trials. Here, we examine the impact of a different type of violation: the mere omission of the standard sound. Capitalizing upon the recent finding that deviant sounds exert distinct effects on response times as a function of whether participants produced or withheld a response on the previous trial, we present the results of an experiment seeking to disentangle two potential effects of sound omission: deviance distraction and the removal of an unspecific warning signal. The results indicate that deviant sound and the unexpected omission of the standard sound impact response times through, at least partially, distinct mechanisms. Deviant sounds affect performance by triggering the orienting of attention towards a new sensory input. Sound omissions, in contrast, appear to affect performance in part because responses no longer benefit from an unspecific warning signal to prepare for action."
https://openalex.org/W4294843893,"Phylogenetic relationships among mediophycean diatoms with elliptical valve outline and elevated apices have long been a subject of interest and debate, particularly with respect to their relationship to pennates. However, results remain inconclusive, whether based on vegetative valve morphology, reproduction, or molecular phylogenetic data. Searching for phylogenetically informative features, we re-examined sexual reproduction, auxospore structure and development in the diatom Biddulphia biddulphiana . Several unique or unusual features and processes characterized its sexual reproduction. A unique spermatogenesis occurs with premeiotic separation of an anucleate protoplast containing all chloroplasts and likely other organelles. Additionally, their auxospore walls are some of the most complex documented, retaining earlier deposited layers that obscure layers formed during later stages of development. The oldest layer consists of thick, mostly organic incunabulum, underlain by outer and inner epizonia and finally transverse (TP) and longitudinal (LP) perizonia. The complexity of the fine structure of these layers is unprecedented. The orientation of some TP bands is also unique in mediophytes, with some perpendicular to the auxospore apical axis, parallel to each other, and open with aligned ends, as typically seen in pennates. The TP also contains rings slanting toward the apices, as in some other mediophytes, e.g., eupodiscaceans. However, both eupodiscaceans and biddulphiaceans show perizonial band structure derived from anastomosing radial scales, thus termed “scaly bands”. Pinnate TP bands, common among pennate auxospores, were not found. Thus B . biddulphiana auxospore wall structure contains a mixture of characters specific to this clone but also known from mediophytes and araphid pennates. However, these features do not provide unequivocal evidence that this or the other Biddulphia species examined to date are the closest extant relatives of basal araphid pennates."

The cooperation and collaboration that was integral to both the Laboratory for Molecular Biology culture and phage genetics fields were key to these endeavors. One of the most widely used and important techniques in modern biology is SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This technique was developed in 1970 by Ulrich K. Laemmli when he was a postdoctoral fellow with Aaron Klug in the Medical Research Council’s Laboratory of Molecular Biology (MRC LMB) in Cambridge, UK (1Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (208094) Google Scholar). Two hundred ninety thousand subsequent papers cite Laemmli’s original publication. This Reflections article provides an account of the conditions and scientific interactions that led to this invaluable technical development. Laemmli’s method, combined with the development of T4 conditional lethal mutants, allowed both of us to identify the phage structural proteins and structural protein interactions critical for T4 assembly. These experiments opened up valuable approaches to the general problem of capsid assembly in double-stranded DNA viruses, as well as to deeper understanding of the folding and misfolding of complex proteins. Aaron Klug had emigrated to the UK from South Africa, coming from the progressive community that rejected apartheid. He joined Rosalind Franklin’s group in London to study nucleic acid structure and always championed her contribution to the revealing the double-stranded helical structure of DNA. Moving to the MRC LMB, Klug focused on virus structure and advancing electron microscope methodology. Jacob V. Maizel Jr, who had made important contributions to the use of SDS and acrylamide gel analysis of poliovirus proteins, was visiting on sabbatical (2Maizel Jr., J.V. Preparative electrophoresis of proteins in acrylamide gels.Ann. N. Y Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 3Shapiro A.L. Vinuela E. Maizel Jr., J.V. Molecular weight estimation of polypeptide chains by electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 28: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (2657) Google Scholar). Aaron Klug had carried out an influential study of the nucleation and assembly of rod-shaped tobacco mosaic virus (4Butler P.J. Klug A. Assembly of the particle of tobacco mosaic virus from RNA and disks of protein.Nat. New Biol. 1971; 229: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and was extending his structural studies to spherical viruses. Laemmli, Maizel, and I—and later Sidney Altman—had come to the MRC LMB to work under Klug on the assembly of phage T4 and other spherical viruses. Klug, with John Finch and Tony Crowther, was leading the effort to understand the structure of spherical viruses through electron microscopy and image processing. Laemmli and I were both postdoctoral fellows at the LMB working to develop electron microscopy and image processing skills. We were particularly welcome because improving these procedures required very uniform stable high-quality samples, which preserved their molecular organization in heavy metal stains. Our purified T4 phage capsids and tail components provided such samples. Crick, Brenner, and coworkers at the LMB had used T4 rII mutants to identify the triplet nature of the genetic code, and the lab had sterile glassware, media, and full support for T4 infection of E. coli. Laemmli’s scientific training in Kellenberger’s group in Geneva involved both sophisticated phage genetics and physical biochemistry. My Caltech background similarly included both classical and microbial genetics and physical biochemistry. The latter was driven by the relationship with the Chemistry Dept, where Linus Pauling did his Nobel Prize work, and which also included Norman Davidson and Jerome Vinograd developing analytical ultracentrifugation. Laemmli’s motivation in developing high-resolution SDS gels was to analyze the structural proteins of the capsid of phage T4. These proteins are strongly, though noncovalently, bonded and not soluble in aqueous buffers. In the 1960s, the groups of R. H. Epstein and Edward Kellenberger in Geneva and R. S. Edgar at Caltech had developed two classes of conditional lethal mutants of phage T4 which interfered with the assembly of the phage structural proteins. Conditional lethal mutants could be isolated in any and every gene that encoded an essential function (5Edgar R.S. Lielausis I. Temperature-sensitive Mutants of bacteriophage T4d: their Isolation and genetic characterization.Genetics. 1964; 49: 649-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Epstein R.H. Bolle, A A. Steinberg C.M.

Kellenberger E. De La Tour E.B. Chevalley R. et al.Physiological Studies of Conditional Lethal Mutants of Bacteriophage T4D. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology1963Crossref Google Scholar). At that time, mutants of structural proteins were very rare, whether in yeast, Neurospora, flies, mice, or humans. There were two classes of conditional lethals: temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants developed by Edgar (5Edgar R.S. Lielausis I. Temperature-sensitive Mutants of bacteriophage T4d: their Isolation and genetic characterization.Genetics. 1964; 49: 649-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and nonsense or amber mutants developed by Epstein (6Epstein R.H. Bolle, A A. Steinberg C.M. Stahl F.W. Amber mutants of bacteriophage T4D: Their isolation and genetic characterization.Genetics. 2012; 190: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the latter case, the mutation generated a stop codon within the normal amino acid coding region of a gene of interest. Propagating these phage strains required the use of E. coli hosts with a mutant suppressor tRNA, which occasionally inserted an amino acid at a stop codon. In the wildtype nonpermissive host bacteria, the nonsense mutation resulted in premature termination of the polypeptide chain and translation of a smaller nonfunctional amber fragment. Isolation of the mutants depended on their growth on one host but not on the other. For ts mutations, isolation was of phage strains that propagated at 25 °C or 30 °C but not at 39 °C to 40 °C. The development of these mutants affecting genes for structural proteins was reported in a seminal—if obscurely titled—paper published in the Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology (7Epstein R. Bolle A. Steinberg C.M. Kellenberger E. De La Tour E.B. Chevalley R. et al.Physiological Studies of Conditional Lethal Mutants of Bacteriophage T4D. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology1963Crossref Google Scholar). Infection of cells with nonsense or ts mutations in genes for structural proteins often led to accumulation of morphogenetic intermediates in virus assembly. Laemmli, Kellenberger, and their coworkers in Geneva had characterized the capsid-related structures accumulating in cells infected with mutants defective in head assembly ((8Laemmli U.K. Molbert E. Showe M. Kellenberger E. Form-determining function of the genes required for the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 49: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar)). As a graduate student at Caltech and working with Bob Edgar and later Bill Wood, I had identified the intermediates in tail assembly and tail fiber assembly (9King J. Assembly of the tail of bacteriophage T4.J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 32: 231-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10King J. Wood W.B. Assembly of bacteriophage T4 tail fibers: The sequence of gene product interaction.J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 39: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis had been invented by Baruch Davis and Leonard J. Ornstein working at New York’s Mt. Sinai hospital, in order to resolve the proteins in blood and related samples. They described their work in two important and classic papers published in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences (11Ornstein L. Disc electrophoresis. I. Background and theory.Ann. N. Y Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (3334) Google Scholar, 12Davis B.J. Disc electrophoresis. Ii. method and application to human serum proteins.Ann. N. Y Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15967) Google Scholar) that are still very much worth reading. The discontinuous gel systems of Ornstein depended on stacking and “compression” of protein species according to their isoelectric point and charge density between two different buffer systems. Ornstein’s papers explained how generating a sharp voltage gradient between the leading edge of one buffer and the trailing edge of a second buffer resulted in proteins of different charge forming narrow bands or discs, driven by the voltage gradient at the discontinuity. The tendency of the bands to spread was opposed by the need for a continuous voltage gradient. In these separations, proteins remained native, and their surface charge of their native states determined their behavior at the buffer interface. Once the proteins passed the discontinuity and entered the separating gel, they were fractionated according to charge and molecular weight. Davis described systematic experiments searching for an optimal matrix and the reasons for settling on polyacrylamide: it was (a) transparent, (b) biologically unreactive, (c) chemically inert, (d) uncharged, and had (e) controllable pore size and (f) mechanical strength. He also provided detailed instructions for preparing gels reproducibly and reliably in the first of the pair of articles. Though Laemmli could isolate capsid structures from phage-infected cells, he was unable to determine their protein composition, since they did not dissociate under native conditions. Jake Maizel had shown for polioviruses that the particles could be dissociated and solubilized through the use of the detergent SDS, including SDS in gels during fractionation. This work had led to their key discovery that in the presence of SDS, polypeptide chains migrated through acrylamide gels proportional to their molecular weight (3Shapiro A.L. Vinuela E. Maizel Jr., J.V. Molecular weight estimation of polypeptide chains by electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 28: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (2657) Google Scholar, 13Edgar R.S. Lielausis I. Serological studies with mutants of phage T4D defective in genes determining tail fiber structure.Genetics. 1965; 52: 1187-1200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Maizel understood that this represented the unfolding of the polypeptide chain and coating with one SDS molecule per peptide bond, generating an elongated rod-shaped complex in which size was proportional to chain molecular weight. Unfortunately, in these early SDS gels, the SDS/polypeptide chain complexes migrated as broad bands. This was adequate for poliovirus with only four protein components (14Maizel Jr., J.V. Summers D.F. Scharff M.D. SDS-acrylamide gel electrophoresis and its application to the proteins of poliovirus- and adenovirus-infected human cells.J. Cell Physiol. 1970; 76: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, for T4, with dozens of proteins needed for particle assembly, the resolution was inadequate. Laemmli had been educated in the Swiss technical system and had a much deeper knowledge of electrochemistry than most of our peer molecular biologists, virologists, and geneticists. He recognized that it should be possible to get the stacking phenomena to work for an SDS polypeptide chain complex and therefore theoretically obtain high resolution under denaturing conditions. He set about trying to find a discontinuous buffer system in which the SDS/polypeptide chains would concentrate and stack at a buffer interface in the stacking gel above the separating gel. This involved making up many buffer and gel solutions, casting gels in glass tubes, running samples, then cracking open the glass tubes, slicing, drying, and staining the gel slices. Since my work on T4 tail assembly was also stymied by the inability to resolve the more than 20 proteins involved (9King J. Assembly of the tail of bacteriophage T4.J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 32: 231-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), I recognized the value of his goal and happily provided an additional pair of hands to explore the many buffer and gel concentration variations that led to the final published method. Laemmli was an intense and hard worker, and my memories are of breathing SDS aerosols which we sprayed on the gel tops to get flat menisci and regular exposure to acrylamide through handling the gels for the slicing and drying, prior to staining. I’m not sure at what point we learned that acrylamide was a neurotoxin that could be absorbed through the skin and that breathing aerosols of SDS was not the best treatment of one’s respiratory tract. Though we did not smoke in the midst of experiments, after a day’s work, we would sit down for a cigarette. (Decades later I came down with cancer of the larynx, which I attributed to the holes punched in my vocal cord membranes by the SDS detergent aerosols, which then provided access of cigarette smoke and particles to the epithelial cells. This is a mechanism thought to account for the increased cancer of the larynx in smokers who are also heavy drinkers). Laemmli succeeded in finding a pair of buffers in which the SDS/polypeptide chains stacked at the discontinuity. Using this gel system, he was able to show that T4 heads were assembled from more than six different proteins and identify them as the products of specific T4 genes (1Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (208094) Google Scholar). Since the phenotype of mutant-infected cells as visualized in the electron microscope had already been determined, he was able to define the pathway of T4 head morphogenesis (8Laemmli U.K. Molbert E. Showe M. Kellenberger E. Form-determining function of the genes required for the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 49: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). One striking feature was the presence of defined proteolytic cleavages of a number of the structural proteins, within the organized lattice, coupled to the stages of icosahedral lattice transformation. These cleavages were clearly important in controlling capsid assembly, but they did make subsequent analysis more difficult. One of the essential proteins, the product of gene 22, was completely proteolyzed and was absent in the mature virion. This was subsequently shown to be the major scaffolding protein for T4 head assembly (15Laemmli U.K. Paulson J.R. Hitchins V. Maturation of the head of bacteriophage T4. V.

This scaffolding function—required for subunit assembly but removed prior to DNA packaging—was clarified when Sherwood Casjens, David Botstein, and I showed that in the Phage P22, the scaffolding exited and recycled, without proteolysis (17King J. Casjens S. Catalytic head assembling protein in virus morphogenesis.Nature. 1974; 251: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These experiments made clear the very surprising fact that a precursor shell is first assembled and then the DNA pumped in through a unique portal vertex (18Wagner J.

Over the following 4 decades, analysis of adenovirus, herpesviruses, and cyanophages revealed that all dsDNA viruses use this general pathway. Such pathways are illustrated in Fig. 1. Laemmli and I immediately used his gel system to identify the T4 proteins needed for tail and tail fiber assembly (20King J. Laemmli U.K. Polypeptides of the tail fibres of bacteriophage T4.J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 62: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 21King J. Laemmli U.K. Bacteriophage T4 tail assembly: Structural proteins and their genetic identification.J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 75: 315-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our 1971 paper had a more detailed description of the buffers and procedures in its Materials and Methods and was helpful to many investigators. An unexpected result at the time was that all the phage structural proteins were translated at the same rate, regardless of whether or not they were assembled into phage structures. Feedback loops between assembly and transcription and translation were minimal, contrary to the models of gene expression from phage lambda and repressor proteins. The tail fibers also required a phage-specified chaperone, the gene 57 product, and the long T4 fiber proteins failed to fold properly in its absence and therefore accumulated in the pellet as an inclusion body. Laemmli went on to demonstrate that the folding of the major gp23 coat protein required a nonstructural protein gp31, which we now know to be phage-specific replacement of the groES subunit of the GroEL/S chaperonin (22Richardson A. van der Vies S.M. Keppel F. Taher A. Landry S.J. Georgopoulos C. Compensatory changes in GroEL/Gp31 affinity as a mechanism for allele-specific genetic interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 52-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the very first micrographs of T4, one of the distinctive morphological features were the long 1600 Å tail fibers which functioned in the initial recognition of and binding to host cells. The distal tip of the fibers recognize lipopolysaccharide receptors on the E. coli surface. Binding to cell surface is accompanied a major conformational change in the phage baseplate, triggering contraction of the sheath and penetration of the tail tube tip through the bacterial cell wall and membrane. Edgar and Lielausis (1965) showed that a cluster of five genes (34, 35, 36, 37, and 38) were required for the assembly of the fibers and that rabbit antibodies neutralizing T4 bound to these fibers. One of the first uses of Laemmli’s gel system was identifying the protein products of the tail fiber genes (20King J. Laemmli U.K. Polypeptides of the tail fibres of bacteriophage T4.J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 62: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Phage proteins were labeled by uptake of radioactive amino acids to enhance the sensitivity of the SDS gel analysis. The 34 and 37 genes encoded very long polypeptide chains of 150,000 and 125,000 Da, respectively. The gel patterns of the proteins in these lysates highlighting the missing proteins from mutant lysates are shown in Fig. 2. Using sucrose gradient centrifugation and assaying the fractions with specific antibodies (13Edgar R.S. Lielausis I. Serological studies with mutants of phage T4D defective in genes determining tail fiber structure.Genetics. 1965; 52: 1187-1200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), I found that each of these very large proteins formed one of the half tail fibers (10King J. Wood W.B. Assembly of bacteriophage T4 tail fibers: The sequence of gene product interaction.J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 39: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) Both the distal and proximal half fibers are slender trimers of intimately interacting extended chains, in some regions triple coiled-coil–like structures and in others closer to triple beta helices (23Hyman P. van Raaij M. Bacteriophage T4 long tail fiber domains.Biophysical Rev. 2018; 10: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Leiman P.G. Arisaka F. Van Raaij M.J. Kostyuchenko V.A. Aksyuk A.A. Kanamaru S. et al.Morphogenesis of the T4 tail and tail fibers.Virol. J. 2010; 7: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Using the rabbit-specific antibodies, we found that the smaller proteins encoded by genes 35 and 36 together form the binding site and elbow joint between the proximal and distal half fibers. Most striking was that the proximal half fiber did not bind to the phage baseplate, not until it was assembled with the proximal half fiber into the complete fiber. This was direct evidence that different parts of the phage were prefabricated before they could interact to form a functional structure. The steps in the tail fiber assembly pathway are shown in Fig. 3. The gene 38 protein did not appear to be incorporated into the particles but was later shown to constitute the site at the fiber tip that recognizes the host receptors. A general feature of tail fiber assembly, as revealed by the SDS gel analysis, was that their translation proceeded whether or not they were assembled into mature fibers and onto the phage. This macromolecular assembly process was not controlled at the level of transcription or translation but entirely by interactions among the precursor proteins. This was a departure from the accepted models of regulation through gene transcription or messenger translation. Since the proximal tip of the proximal half fiber did not bind to the phage baseplate until it was assembled to the distal half fiber, a conformational signal needed to be propagated from the elbow 600A to the proximal tip. The gene 57 and 38 proteins turned out to be chaperones required for the folding of the gp37 distal half fiber. Thus, in the absence of gp57, the 140,000 gp37 chains accumulated as an insoluble inclusion body state. The high-resolution SDS gels were key to showing that this pelleted material contained the full-length but incorrectly folded gp37 tail fiber chains. Though the fibers appear smooth and continuous in negatively stained electron micrographs, the eventual determination of the three dimensional structure by van Raaij and coworkers revealed a more complex morphology (Fig. 4). With proteins involved in head and tail fiber assembly having been uncovered, the next challenge was to identify the proteins specified by the 20+ genes needed to assemble the baseplate, tail tube, and contractile tail sheath of the phage. I had taken with me the complete collection of amber and temperature-sensitive mutant strains from Caltech to the MRC and then back to MIT. Using Laemmli’s high-resolution SDS gels, Nadia Mykolajewycz and I (25King J. Mykolajewyoz N. Bacteriophage T4 tail assembly: Proteins of the sheath, core and baseplate.J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 75: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were able to identify all the polypeptide chains encoded by the “tail” genes (their mutant phenotypes were accumulation of complete heads). Fig. 5 shows SDS-PAGE patterns of the phage structural proteins translated late during infection, with the gp18 sheath protein and gp19 tail tube protein identified as the product of mutant genes. We then decided to move forward and tackle the steps in the assembly of the very complex baseplate, built as a metastable hexagonal structure. However, upon signals from binding to the cell surface, the baseplate transforms and expands to a six-pointed star which releases the tip of the tail tube to initiate DNA injection into the infected cell (26Crowther R.A. Lenk E.V. Kikuchi Y. King J. Molecular reorganization in the hexagon to star transition of the baseplate of bacteriophage T4.J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 489-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The analysis of baseplate assembly was carried out by the very hard-working and extremely careful experimentalist Yoshiko Kikuchi, who joined my lab at MIT as a postdoctoral fellow. Yoshiko determined the sedimentation behavior of all the unassembled or partially assembled baseplate proteins accumulating in cells missing one of the proteins. This allowed us to determine the baseplate assembly pathway, which had two components: assembly of the central hub and the outer arms (27Kikuchi Y. King J.

Yoshiko was also able to establish conditions in which these steps proceeded in vitro, by refinements of Edgar and Woods’ in vitro complementation between extracts made from cells infected with phages harboring mutant genes. This provided confirmation of the model above (Fig. 6). It should be noted that every one of Yoshiko’s experiments demonstrated that the unassembled proteins required for the later steps in tail assembly, for example the tube and sheath subunits, existed in a soluble state prior to polymerization. These unassembled subunits were biologically competent since mixing extracts of the mutant-infected cells led to the production of infectious T4 phage (27Kikuchi Y. King J.

The study aims to investigate if aberrant epigenetic DNA methylation changes may be a potential mechanism for regulating neighborhood exposures and health outcomes. Methods Exposure to environmental stressors identified in 98 young African American (AA) adults aged 18–25 years old from the Washington D.C., area were used in the study. We correlated the association between stress markers; cortisol, CRP, IgG, IGA, IgM, and self-reported exposure to violence and stress, with quantitative DNA methylation changes in a panel of gene-specific loci using saliva DNA. Results In all participants studied, the exposure to violence was significant and negatively correlated with DNA methylation of MST1R loci (p = 0.032; r = -0.971) and nominally significant with NR3C1 loci (p = 0.053; r = -0.948). In addition, we observed significant and negative correlation of DNA methylation changes of LINE 1 (p = 0.044; r = -0.248); NR3C 1 (p = 0.017; r = -0.186); MSTR 1 (p = 0.022; r = -0.192); and DRD 2 (p = 0.056; r = -0.184; albeit nominal significant correlation) with IgA expression. On the other hand, we observed a significant and position correlation of DNA methylation changes in DRD 2 (p = 0.037; r = 0.184) with IgG expression. When participants were stratified by sex, we observed in AA young male adults, significant DNA methylation changes of MST1R (p&lt; 0.05) and association with exposure to violence and IgG level. We also observed significant DNA methylation levels of DRD2 (p&lt; 0.05) and association with IgA, IgG, and cortisol level. Furthermore, we observed significant DNA methylation changes of NR3C1 (p&lt; 0.05) with stress, IgA, and IgG in the male participants only. On the other hand, we only observed significant and a positive association of IgG with DNA methylation levels of ESR 1 (p = 0.041) in the young AA female participants. Conclusion Our preliminary observation of significant DNA methylation changes in neuronal and immune genes in saliva samples supports our recently published genome-wide DNA methylations changes in blood samples from young AA male adults indicating that saliva offers a non-invasive means for DNA methylation prediction of exposure to environmental stressors in a gender-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W4294798051,"Advanced care planning (ACP) includes advance directives (AD), which can specify provisions for palliative care and types of life-sustaining treatments for an individual requiring end-of-life (EoL) care. ACP for persons in the early stages of cognitive decline can decrease anxiety and conflict for family members needing to make decisions about EoL-care, which is especially critical for family caregivers (FCGs) if they play a role as a surrogate regarding healthcare decisions. However, ACP for persons with cognitive impairment (PWCIs) is often overlooked. This study explored the effects of a family-centered ACP intervention on decisions about EoL-care, life-sustaining treatment decisions, and discussions of related topics among PWCIs and FCGs. The study was conducted in outpatient clinics of regional teaching hospitals in northern Taiwan. Participants were dyads consisting of persons diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and their FCGs. The family-centered ACP intervention was provided by an ACP-trained senior registered nurse. A one-group, pretest-posttest design was used to evaluate the effect of the intervention on 44 dyads. Four structured questionnaires collected data regarding familiarity with ACP, intention to engage in ACP, participation in personal discussions between the dyads about ACP, and consistency between PWCIs and FCGs for decisions about life-sustaining treatments at EoL. Paired t, Kappa, and McNemar tests were used to compare differences between pre-intervention data (pretest) and post-intervention data (posttest). There were significant increases in familiarity with ACP, components of ACP, and the number of topics PWCIs and FCGs personally discussed surrounding EoL-care decisions. There was no change for either group in wanting to have a formal ACP consultation and only modest increases in consistency between PWCIs and FCGs for life-sustaining treatment decisions after completion of the family-centered ACP intervention. Clinicians caring for PWCIs should incorporate family-centered ACP interventions and support ongoing discussions about life-sustaining medical treatments to ensure their preferences regarding EoL-care are respected. The accessibility and availability of consultations about ACP should also be provided."

Here, the aim was to assess the changes in growth patterns before and after brain tumor diagnosis, the adult height, and the risk factors for compromised growth. The incidence and treatment practices of growth hormone deficiency were analyzed.A cohort of 73 survivors of childhood brain tumor (median age 27.2 years, range 16.2 to 43.8 years) was studied after a median follow-up period of 20.4 years from diagnosis (IQR 14.9 to 22.9 years). Patients were treated in five university hospitals in Finland between 1970 and 2008. Growth curves, final height, and patient- and disease-related risk factors for compromised growth during different growth periods were analyzed. Laboratory analyses for IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were performed at the follow-up.Growth failure was evident at diagnosis, with a mean height decline of -0.6 SDS (standard deviation score) from birth (95% CI -1.15 to -0.05). Mean height SDS decline after the diagnosis was -1.09 SDS (95%CI -1.51 to -0.66). At follow-up, 37% of the study subjects (27/73) had true short stature (height < -2 SDS). The mean height deficit corrected for target height was -1.9 SDS (95% CI -1.45 to -2.40). Growth failure was associated with the age at diagnosis, corticosteroid dose, radiotherapy modality and mean dose of irradiation in the thalamic area. Low IGF-1 level (below -2.0 SDS) was found in 32% (23/72), and untreated growth hormone deficiency in 40% (29/72) of the subjects.Longitudinal growth impairment was common in radiotherapy-treated survivors of childhood brain tumor, resulting in compromised adult height. Loss of growth potential was evident already at diagnosis and further accelerated by the treatments. At young adulthood, unrecognized growth hormone deficiency was common."
https://openalex.org/W4294843832,"Violence events tend to cluster together geospatially. Various features of communities and their residents have been highlighted as explanations for such clustering in the literature. One reliable correlate of violence is neighborhood instability. Research on neighborhood instability indicates that such instability can be measured as property tax delinquency, yet no known work has contrasted external and internal sources of instability in predicting neighborhood violence. To this end we collected data on violence events, company and personal property tax delinquency, population density, race, income, food stamps, and alcohol outlets for each of Richmond, Virginia's 148 neighborhoods. We constructed and compared ordinary least-squares (OLS) to geographically weighted regression (GWR) models before constructing a final algorithm-selected GWR model. Our results indicated that the tax delinquency of company-owned properties (e.g., rental homes, apartments) was the only variable in our model (R2 = 0.62) that was associated with violence in all but four Richmond neighborhoods. We replicated this analysis using violence data from a later point in time which yielded largely identical results. These findings indicate that external sources of neighborhood instability may be more important to predicting violence than internal sources. Our results further provide support for social disorganization theory and point to opportunities to expand this framework."

However, the link between CRC development and the risk locus at 4q32.2 is unknown. We investigated the promoter activity of NAF1 and FSTL5 and analyzed the risk locus at 4q32.2 as gene regulatory region. Our results showed that the activity of the FSTL5 promoter was low compared to the NAF1 promoter. Analyses of the NAF1 promoter in conjunction with the region containing the risk locus at 4q32.2 showed that the region functions as gene regulatory region with repressor activity on NAF1 promoter activity. The SNP rs17042479(G) increased the repressor effect of the region. CRC patients' biopsies were genotyped for SNP rs17042479(A/G), and NAF1 expression profiles were examined. We found an association between SNP rs17042479(G), cancer stage and tumor location. Additionally, patients with SNP rs17042479(G) showed lower NAF1 expression in comparison to patients with SNP rs17042479(A) in tumor tissue and the NAF1 expression in tumor tissue was lower compared to healthy tissue. The results in the study imply that reduced NAF1 expression in the tumor contribute to a more aggressive phenotype. Furthermore, this study suggests that the SNP rs17042479(G) change the expression of NAF1 and thereby increases the risk of developing CRC."
https://openalex.org/W4294843963,"This study aims to evaluate whether a test protocol with standardized and individualized resistance settings leads to valid wheelchair Wingate tests (WAnT) and graded exercise tests (GXT) in healthy novices. Twenty able-bodied individuals (10M/10F, age 23 ± 2 years, body mass 72 ± 11 kg) performed an isometric strength test, sprint test, WAnT and GXT on a wheelchair ergometer. Using a previously developed set of regression equations, individuals’ isometric strength outcome was used to estimate the WAnT result (P30 est ), from which an effective individual WAnT resistance was derived. The subsequently measured WAnT outcome (P30 meas ) was used to estimate the GXT outcome (POpeak est ) and to scale the individual GXT resistance steps. Estimated and measured outcomes were compared. The WAnT protocol was considered valid when maximal velocity did not exceed 3 m·s -1 ; the GXT protocol was considered valid when test duration was 8–12 min. P30 est did not significantly differ from P30 meas , while one participant did not have a valid WanT, as maximal velocity exceeded 3 m·s -1 . POpeak est was 10% higher than POpeak meas , and six participants did not reach a valid GXT: five participants had a test duration under 8 min and one participant over 12 min. The isometric strength test can be used to individually scale the WAnT protocol. The WAnT outcome scaled the protocol for the GXT less accurately, resulting in mostly shorter-than-desired test durations. In conclusion, the evaluated standardized and individualized test protocol was valid for the WAnT but less valid for the GXT among a group of novices. Before implementing the standardized individual test protocol on a broader scale, e.g. among paralympic athletes, it should be evaluated among different athletic wheelchair-dependent populations."

We calculated differences in avoidable and potentially avoidable ED visits by the beneficiary's PCMH attribution type and in relation to differences in proximity to their primary care providers versus hospitals. Outcomes were defined using the New York University Emergency Department Algorithm (NYU-EDA). Differences in ED visit risk were assessed using generalized estimation equations and compared using marginal effects models.The 2.4 percentage point reduction in risk of avoidable ED visits among children in the ADD cohort who attended a PCMH versus those who did not increased to 3.9 to 7.2 percentage points as relative proximity to primary care providers versus hospitals improved (p < 0.01). Children in the ADD and MMA cohorts that were enrolled in a medical home, but did not attend one for primary care services exhibited a 5.4 and 3.0 percentage point increase in avoidable ED visit compared to children who were unenrolled and did not attend medical homes (p < 0.05), but these differences were only observed when geographic proximity to hospitals was more convenient than primary care providers. Mixed findings were observed for potentially avoidable visits.In several health care performance evaluations, patient-centered medical homes have not been found to reduce differences in hospital utilization for conditions that are treatable in primary care settings among children with chronic illnesses. Analytical approaches that also consider geographic proximity to health care services can identify performance benefits of medical homes. Expanding risk-adjustment models to also include geographic data would benefit ongoing quality improvement initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W4294883956,"Both urban planners and urban scholars have been keenly interested in identifying the characteristics associated with neighborhood satisfaction. One robust but surprising pattern is that the presence or number of children in a household has no effect on neighborhood satisfaction. To clarify this pattern, we measured the neighborhood satisfaction of a representative sample of 1,000 Michigan adults, whom we divided into six distinct reproductive statuses: co-parents, single-parents, empty nesters, not-yet-parents, childless individuals, and childfree individuals. We found that a simple parent vs. non-parent dichotomy hides significant heterogeneity among these groups. Specifically, we found that single parents and childfree individuals experience significantly less neighborhood satisfaction than other groups. We conclude by reflecting on the methodological and practical implications of differences in neighborhood satisfaction when more nuanced reproductive statuses are considered."

To test whether perceived scarcity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has an impact on vaccination willingness, a preregistered online experiment with N = 175 non-vaccinated German participants was conducted during a period of national vaccine shortage. Perceived vaccine scarcity was manipulated by either telling participants that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in their district would be particularly scarce in the upcoming weeks or that above-average quantities would be available. The results show that individuals in the scarcity-condition were significantly more willing to get vaccinated than those in the surplus-condition. In addition, individuals in the scarcity-condition were found to express more anger towards the debate on relaxations for vaccinated versus non-vaccinated individuals. The results indicate that even superficial processes such as a perception of scarcity can influence people's willingness to get vaccinated."
https://openalex.org/W4294884133,"High-throughput screening of available genomic data and identification of potential antigenic candidates have promoted the development of epitope-based vaccines and therapeutics. Several immunoinformatic tools are available to predict potential epitopes and other immunogenicity-related features, yet it is still challenging and time-consuming to compare and integrate results from different algorithms. We developed the R script SILVI (short for: from in silico to in vivo ), to assist in the selection of the potentially most immunogenic T-cell epitopes from Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-binding prediction data. SILVI merges and compares data from available HLA-binding prediction servers, and integrates additional relevant information of predicted epitopes, namely BLASTp alignments with host proteins and physical-chemical properties. The two default criteria applied by SILVI and additional filtering allow the fast selection of the most conserved, promiscuous, strong binding T-cell epitopes. Users may adapt the script at their discretion as it is written in open-source R language. To demonstrate the workflow and present selection options, SILVI was used to integrate HLA-binding prediction results of three example proteins, from viral, bacterial and parasitic microorganisms, containing validated epitopes included in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), plus the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) proteome. Applying different filters on predicted IC50, hydrophobicity and mismatches with host proteins allows to significantly reduce the epitope lists with favourable sensitivity and specificity to select immunogenic epitopes. We contemplate SILVI will assist T-cell epitope selections and can be continuously refined in a community-driven manner, helping the improvement and design of peptide-based vaccines or immunotherapies.

To address this gap, this study examined the extent to which football safety knowledge and attitudes toward head injury risk are associated with adults’ willingness to allow teenage boys to play high school tackle football. Data were obtained from an internet-based survey of a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults aged 18 to 93 years (n = 1,018). We conducted multilevel linear regression modelling to examine independent effects of the football safety knowledge- and attitude-based predictors. Our analyses revealed that knowledge of football safety measures, along with four of the five attitude-based variables were significantly associated with adults’ willingness to allow teenagers to participate in tackle football, over and above demographic factors. This study provides the first nationally representative examination of willingness to allow tackle football participation while extending our understanding of the gap between policy, public perception, and behavior present in U.S. high school football. These results point to promising directions for stakeholders aiming to increase tackle football participation as an increased understanding of the factors associated with participation may help inform effective policymaking, intervention design, and parental decision making."

This study explored the feeling of insecurity in public spaces among young women in a city located near the northern border of Mexico.This study was based on the tradition of grounded theory. Purposive sampling was used, and 24 group interviews were conducted with junior high school, high school and university students to understand the conditions that favour the emergence of the feeling of insecurity, its psychosocial consequences and management strategies. A computer-assisted qualitative analysis was performed using MAXQDA 18 software. The study showed that street harassment was manifested mainly as sexual harassment but generated a continuous threat of feminicide and disappearance. Young women experienced discomfort and restrictions on mobility, and they had to assume individual responsibility for their safety in the absence of support from the state.The interaction between gender and age determines the vulnerability to crime in urban spaces. Future studies could analyse the chronic impact of this continuum of threats and develop psychosocial interventions that promote the empowerment of young women."
https://openalex.org/W4294904723,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) rely on viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes to control transcription and replication. Each vRNP consists of one viral genomic RNA segment associated with multiple nucleoproteins (NP) and a trimeric IAV RNA polymerase complex. Previous studies showed that post-translational modifications of vRNP components, such as NP, by host factors would in turn affect the IAV life cycle or modulate host anti-viral response. In this study, we found host E3 ubiquitin ligase Pirh2 interacted with NP and mediated short-chain ubiquitination of NP at lysine 351, which suppressed NP-PB2 interaction and vRNP formation. In addition, we showed that knockdown of Pirh2 promoted IAV replication, whereas overexpression of Pirh2 inhibited IAV replication. However, Pirh2-ΔRING lacking E3 ligase activity failed to inhibit IAV infection. Moreover, we showed that Pirh2 had no effect on the replication of a rescued virus, WSN-K351R, carrying lysine-to-arginine substitution at residue 351. Interestingly, by analyzing human and avian IAVs from 2011 to 2020 in influenza research databases, we found that 99.18% of 26 977 human IAVs encode lysine, but 95.3% of 9956 avian IAVs encode arginine at residue 351 of NP protein. Consistently, knockdown of Pirh2 failed to promote propagation of two avian-like influenza viruses, H9N2-W1 and H9N2-C1, which naturally encode arginine at residue 351 of NP. Taken together, we demonstrated that Pirh2 is a host factor restricting IAV infection by modulating short-chain ubiquitination of NP. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that residue 351 of NP targeted by Pirh2 may associate with the evasion of human anti-viral response against avian-like influenza viruses."

However, there are no experimental studies that show that intravascular hemolysis promotes alterations in erectile function. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle relaxant function in a murine model that displays intravascular hemolysis induced by phenylhydrazine (PHZ), as well as the role of intravascular hemolysis in increasing the stress oxidative in the penis. Corpus cavernosum strips were dissected free and placed in organ baths. Acetylcholine and electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced corpus cavernosum relaxations in vitro were obtained. Increased corpus cavernosum relaxant responses to acetylcholine and EFS were observed in the PHZ group. Protein expression of heme oxygenase-1 increased in the corpus cavernosum of the PHZ group, but PDE5 protein expression was not modified. Preincubation with the heme oxygenase inhibitor 1 J completely reversed the increased relaxant responses to acetylcholine and EFS in PHZ mice. Protein expression of NADPH oxidase subunit gp91phox, 3-nitrotyrosine, and 4-hydroxynonenal increased in the corpus cavernosum of the PHZ group, suggesting a state of oxidative stress. Basal cGMP production was lower in the PHZ group. Our results show that intravascular hemolysis promotes increased corpus cavernosum smooth muscle relaxation associated with increased HO-1 expression, as well as increased oxidative stress associated with upregulation of gp91phox expression. Moreover, our study supports clinical studies that point to a strong positive correlation between priapism and high levels of intravascular hemolysis in men with SCD."
