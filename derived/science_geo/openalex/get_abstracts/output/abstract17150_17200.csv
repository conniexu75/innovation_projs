https://openalex.org/W1978368163,"Effective methods are needed to identify and isolate those genes that are differentially expressed in various cells or under altered conditions. This report describes a method to separate and clone individual messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by means of the polymerase chain reaction. The key element is to use a set of oligonucleotide primers, one being anchored to the polyadenylate tail of a subset of mRNAs, the other being short and arbitrary in sequence so that it anneals at different positions relative to the first primer. The mRNA subpopulations defined by these primer pairs were amplified after reverse transcription and resolved on a DNA sequencing gel. When multiple primer sets were used, reproducible patterns of amplified complementary DNA fragments were obtained that showed strong dependence on sequence specificity of either primer."
https://openalex.org/W2108172661,"Gene amplification occurs at high frequency in transformed cells (10(-3)-10(-5)), but is undetectable in normal diploid fibroblasts (less than 10(-9)). This study examines whether alterations of one or both p53 alleles were sufficient to allow gene amplification to occur. Cells retaining one wild-type p53 allele mimicked the behavior of primary diploid cells: they arrested growth in the presence of drug and failed to demonstrate amplification. Cells losing the second p53 allele failed to arrest when placed in drug and displayed the ability to amplify at a high frequency. Thus, loss of wild-type p53 may lead to amplification, possibly caused by changes in cell cycle progression. Other determinants can by-pass this p53 function, however, since tumor cells with wild-type p53 have the ability to amplify genes."

https://openalex.org/W2012638283,"Two critical amino acids in the visual pigment rhodopsin are Lys-296, the site of attachment of retinal to the protein through a protonated Schiff base linkage, and Glu-113, the Schiff base counterion. Mutation of Lys-296 or Glu-113 results in constitutive activation of opsin, as assayed by its ability to activate transducin in the absence of added chromophore. We conclude that opsin is constrained to an inactive conformation by a salt bridge between Lys-296 and Glu-113. Recently, one of the mutants, K296E, was found in a family with retinitis pigmentosa, suggesting that degeneration of the photoreceptor cells in individuals with this mutation may result from persistent stimulation of the phototransduction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2165328940,"Voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels that control neurotransmitter release are blocked by omega-conotoxin (omega-CgTx) GVIA from the marine snail Conus geographus, the most widely used inhibitor of neurotransmitter release. However, many mammalian synapses are omega-CgTx-GVIA insensitive. We describe a new Conus peptide, omega-CgTx-MVIIC, that is an effective inhibitor of omega-CgTx-GVIA-resistant synaptic transmission. Ca2+ channel targets that are inhibited by omega-CgTx-MVIIC but not by omega-CgTx-GVIA include those mediating depolarization-induced 45Ca2+ uptake in rat synaptosome preparations, ""P"" currents in cerebellar Purkinje cells, and a subset of omega-CgTx-GVIA-resistant currents in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells. The characterization of omega-CgTx-MVIIC by a combination of molecular genetics and chemical synthesis defines a general approach for obtaining ligands with novel receptor subtype specificity from Conus."
https://openalex.org/W1501494207,"Infectious scrapie prions are composed largely, if not entirely, of an abnormal isoform of the prion protein (PrP) which is designated PrPSc. A chromosomal gene encodes both the cellular prion protein (PrPC) as well as PrPSc. Pulse-chase experiments with scrapie-infected cultured cells indicate that PrPSc is formed by a post-translational process. PrP is translated in the endoplasmic reticulum, modified as it passes through the Golgi, and is transported to the cell surface. Release of nascent PrP from the cell surface by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C or hydrolysis with dispase prevented PrPSc synthesis. At 18 degrees C, the synthesis of PrPSc was inhibited under conditions that other investigators report a blockage of endosomal fusion with lysosomes. Our results suggest that PrPSc synthesis occurs after PrP transits from the cell surface. Whether all of the PrP molecules have an equal likelihood to be converted into PrPSc or only a distinct subset is eligible for conversion remains to be established. Identifying the subcellular compartment(s) of PrPSc synthesis should be of considerable importance in defining the molecular changes that distinguish PrPSc from PrPC."
https://openalex.org/W2064631075,"Lymphoid cells from scid mice initiate V(D)J recombination normally but have a severely reduced ability to join coding segments. Thymocytes from scid mice contain broken DNA molecules at the TCRδ locus that have coding ends, as well as molecules with signal ends, whereas in normal mice we previously detected only signal ends. Remarkably, these coding (but not signal) ends are sealed into hairpin structures. The formation of hairpins at coding ends may be a universal, early step in V(D)J recombination; this would provide a simple explanation for the origin of P nucleotides in coding joints. These findings may shed light on the mechanism of cleavage and suggest a possible role for the scid factor."
https://openalex.org/W2058453385,"The Arabidopsis floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG) is required for development of the reproductive organs (stamens and carpels). In ag mutants, the loss of AG function leads to the conversion of these organs to the perianth organs (petals and sepals). In contrast, mutations in another floral homeotic gene, APETALA2 (AP2), result in the replacement of the perianth organs by the reproductive organs. On the basis of these observations, it has been proposed that AG and AP2 act in an antagonistic fashion. To test this hypothesis, we have studied the effects of ectopically expressed AG in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. The flowers of the transgenic plants exhibit a range of phenotypes mirroring those of ap2 mutants. These experiments provide direct evidence of the proposed antagonism between AG and AP2 functions, and the results strongly suggest that AG does indeed inhibit AP2 function."

https://openalex.org/W2127012355,"Binding of endocytic carrier vesicles to microtubules depends on the microtubule-binding protein CLIP-170 in vitro. In vivo, CLIP-170 colocalizes with a subset of transferrin receptor-positive endocytic structures and, more extensively, with endosomal tubules induced by brefeldin A. The structure of CLIP-170 has been analyzed by cloning its cDNA. The predicted non-helical C- and N-terminal domains of the homodimeric protein are connected by a long coiled-coil domain. We have identified a novel motif present in a tandem repeat in the N-terminal domain of CLIP-170 that is involved in binding to microtubules. This motif is also found in the Drosophila Glued and yeast BIK1 proteins. These features, together with its very elongated structure, suggest that CLIP-170 belongs to a novel class of proteins, cytoplasmic linker proteins (CLIPs), mediating interactions of organelles with microtubules."

https://openalex.org/W2049905665,"Two second messenger pathways, one that uses the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), the other that uses protein kinase C (PKC), have been found to contribute to the short-term presynaptic facilitation of the connections between the sensory neurons in Aplysia and their target cells, the interneurons and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex. To study their relative contributions as a function of the previous history of the neuron's activity, we have examined the effects of inhibiting PKA (using Rp-cAMPS) and PKC (using H7) on the short-term facilitation of spontaneous release as well as of the evoked release induced by serotonin at nondepressed, partially depressed, and highly depressed synapses. Our results suggest that whereas activation of PKA is sufficient to trigger the facilitation of nondepressed synapses, activation of both PKA and PKC is required to facilitate depressed synapses, with the contribution of PKC becoming progressively more important as synaptic transmission becomes more depressed."
https://openalex.org/W1978511926,"The primary function of synaptic vesicles is to store and release neurotransmitter. Synaptic vesicles are locally recycled following exocytosis and rapidly refilled with neurotransmitter from the cytoplasm by a process that depends on the electrochemical gradient generated by a proton pump. Little is known about the molecules that import neurotransmitter into synaptic vesicles. We report here that the sequence of the synaptic vesicle protein SV2 identifies this protein as a novel type of transmembrane transporter. The deduced amino acid sequence of SV2 contains two sets of six predicted transmembrane domains: the six most N-terminal transmembrane domains are highly homologous to a subfamily of transporters that includes the human glucose transporter, while the six most C-terminal domains are homologous to the plasma membrane transporters for neurotransmitters. We propose that SV2 mediates transport of neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2083045813,"Neurons in the nucleus magnocellularis (nMAG) of the chicken precisely transmit auditory nerve activity via glutamatergic synapses. Using techniques for rapid application of solutions, we have explored the properties of CNQX-sensitive glutamate receptors in whole cells and outside-out patches from the nMAG. Glutamate-evoked current in patches desensitized biphasically to less than 1% of the peak current, with a fast time constant of 960 μs at 22°C, decreasing to 570 μs at 33°C. Dose-response studies using kainate indicated that at least two agonist molecules bind to gate the channel. We propose a kinetic model that quantitatively describes our experimental observations. The rapid kinetics of this receptor are well suited to allow phase locking of synaptic signals to auditory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1579903794,"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) binds to the guanylyl cyclase-A (GC-A) receptor found in tissues such as the kidney and adrenal gland, resulting in marked elevations of the intracellular signaling molecule, cGMP. Here, GC-A is shown to exist as a phosphoprotein when expressed in human embryonic 293 cells. The 32P is principally associated with phosphoserine, with only trace amounts of phosphothreonine. The addition of ANP causes a time-dependent dephosphorylation of the receptor, as well as desensitization, which is not due to an ANP-mediated decrease in the amount of receptor protein. The mobility of GC-A on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis increases after treatment of cells with ANP, and protein phosphatase 2A induces the same mobility shift. The protein phosphatase also catalyzes dephosphorylation of GC-A, and this is directly correlated with decreases in ANP-stimulatable guanylyl cyclase activity. Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, blocks both the dephosphorylation and the desensitization. Therefore, in contrast to many other cell surface receptors, GC-A is desensitized by ligand-induced dephosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1979518727,"T cells of the immune system respond only to foreign antigens because those cells with reactivity for self proteins are either deleted during their development or rendered nonresponsive (anergic). The maintenance of the nonresponsive state was found to require the continual exposure of the anergic T cells to antigen. When anergic T cells were removed from the self antigen by adoptive transfer to a mouse strain lacking the antigen or by in vitro culture, nonresponsiveness was reversed and the anergic cells returned to normal functional status."
https://openalex.org/W1987854164,"We report evidence that a major histocompatibility complex-encoded nonclassic class I molecule presents a foreign peptide to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) during an infection. Mice immunized with virulent Listeria monocytogenes generate CD8+ CTL with alpha beta receptors specific for a bacterial peptide presented by a conserved class I molecule encoded in the M region of the major histocompatibility complex. The Listeria peptide is digested by carboxypeptidase Y but resists aminopeptidase M, and only peptides with N-formyl methionine competitively block its presentation to CTL. Transfection with the H-2M3d gene enables a negative (H-2w17) cell line to present the bacterial peptide. One function, therefore, of H-2M3 is to present bacterial peptides to CTL during infection."
https://openalex.org/W1980089349,"Synaptic connections between the sensory and motor neurons of Aplysia in culture undergo long-term facilitation in response to serotonin (5-HT) and long-term depression in response to FMRFamide. These long-term functional changes are dependent on the synthesis of macromolecules during the period in which the transmitter is applied and are accompanied by structural changes. There is an increase and a decrease, respectively, in the number of sensory neuron varicosities in response to 5-HT and FMRFamide. To determine whether macromolecular synthesis is also required for the structural changes, we examined in parallel the effects of inhibitors of protein (anisomycin) or RNA (actinomycin D) synthesis on the structural and functional changes. We have found that anisomycin and actinomycin D block both the enduring alterations in varicosity number and the long-lasting changes in synaptic potential. These results indicate that macromolecular synthesis is required for expression of the long-lasting structural changes in the sensory cells and that this synthesis is correlated with the long-term functional modulation of sensorimotor synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1490043608,"Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, is transported into bovine synaptic vesicles in a manner that is ATP dependent and requires a vesicular electrochemical proton gradient. We studied the electrical and chemical elements of this driving force and evaluated the effects of chloride on transport. Increasing concentrations of Cl- were found to increase the steady-state ATP-dependent vesicular pH gradient (delta pH) and were found to concomitantly decrease the vesicular membrane potential (delta psi). Low millimolar chloride concentrations, which cause 3-6-fold stimulation of vesicular glutamate uptake, caused small but measurable increases in delta pH and decreases in delta psi, when compared to control vesicles in the absence of chloride. Nigericin in potassium buffers was used to alter the relative proportions of delta pH and delta psi. Compared to controls, at all chloride concentrations tested, nigericin virtually abolished delta pH and increased the vesicle interior positive delta psi. Concomitantly, nigericin increased ATP-dependent glutamate uptake in 0-1 mM chloride but decreased glutamate uptake in 4 mM (45%), 20 mM (80%), and 140 mM (75%) Cl- (where delta pH in the absence of nigericin was large). These findings suggest that either delta psi, delta pH, or a combination can drive glutamate uptake, but to different degrees. In the presence of 4 mM Cl-, where uptake is optimal, both delta psi and delta pH contribute to the driving force for uptake. When the extravesicular pH was increased from 7.4 to 8.0, more Cl- was required to stimulate vesicular glutamate uptake. In the absence of Cl-, as extravesicular pH was lowered to 6.8, uptake was over 3-fold greater than it was at pH 7.4. As extravesicular pH was reduced from 8.0 toward 6.8, less Cl- was required for maximal stimulation. Decreasing the extravesicular pH from 8.0 to 6.8 in the absence of Cl- significantly increased glutamate uptake activity, even though proton-pumping ATPase activity actually decreased about 45% under identical conditions. In the absence of chloride, nigericin increased glutamate uptake at all the pH values tested except pH 8.0. Glutamate uptake at pH 6.8 in the presence of nigericin was over 6-fold greater than uptake at pH 7.4 in the absence of nigericin. We conclude from these experiments that optimal ATP-dependent glutamate uptake requires a large delta psi and a small delta pH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2072716768,"The inner ear of all jawed vertebrates arises from the epithelium of the otic vesicle and contains three semicircular canals, otoliths, and sets of sensory neurons, all positioned precisely within the cranium to detect head orientation and movement. The msh-C gene and two new homebox genes, msh-D and a gene related to distal-less, dlx-3, are each expressed in distinct regions of the otic vesicle during its early development in zebrafish embryos. Cells in the ectoderm express dlx-3 before induction of the otic vesicle, suggesting that dlx-3 has an early function in this process. Later, cells aligned with the future axes of the semicircular canals specifically express either dlx-3 or msh-D. Even later, sensory hair cells express msh-C and msh-D, while other cells of the epithelium express dlx-3. The early expression of these genes could specify the orientation and morphogenesis of the inner ear, whereas their later expression could specify the fates of particular cell types."

https://openalex.org/W2046184823,"Transcription of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. We have identified sequences from -205 to -182 as the minimal enhancer for TH in pheochromocytoma cells using site-directed mutagenesis. This segment (TGATTCAGAGGCAGGTGCCTGTGA) is composed of an AP-1 motif (TGATTCA) and an overlapping 20 bp dyad whose core resembles an E box site (CANNTG). Interaction between the two elements is necessary both in vivo and in vitro: mutation of either element caused a 65%-95% reduction in transcription, and the combination of the two elements conferred cell-specific activation on a heterologous promoter; separation of the two elements by an additional helical turn not only disrupted a DNA-protein complex unique to the two elements, but also abolished expression in vivo. Therefore, we conclude that the interaction between the AP-1 and the E box dyad motifs is responsible for cell-specific TH expression."
https://openalex.org/W2084210856,"The alpha 2A-adrenergic receptor (adrenoceptor) was stably expressed in AtT20 mouse pituitary tumor cells; adrenoceptor agonists inhibited adenylyl cyclase, inhibited voltage-dependent calcium currents, and increased inwardly rectifying potassium currents. An aspartic acid residue (Asp79) highly conserved among guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors was mutated to asparagine; in cells transfected with the mutant alpha 2-receptor, agonists inhibited adenylyl cyclase and calcium currents but did not increase potassium currents. Because distinct G proteins appear to couple adrenoceptors to potassium and calcium currents, the present findings suggest that the mutant alpha 2-adrenoceptor cannot achieve the conformation necessary to activate G proteins that mediate potassium channel activation."

https://openalex.org/W2088912528,"Recent observations have led to the suggestion that the metabotropic glutamate receptor may play a role in the induction or maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP). However, experimental evidence supporting a role for this receptor in the induction of LTP is still inconclusive and controversial. Here we report that, in rat dorsolateral septal nucleus (DLSN) neurons, which have the highest density of metabotropic receptors and show functional responses, the induction of LTP is not blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, but is blocked by two putative metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, L-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid and L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate. Furthermore, superfusion of (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid, a selective metabotropic glutamate agonist, resulted in a long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission similar to that induced by tetanic stimuli. Our results demonstrated that activation of postsynaptic metabotropic receptors is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of LTP in the DLSN, and we suggest that such a mechanism may be important at other CNS synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2039898903,Calcium-dependent glutamate secretion was reconstituted in Xenopus oocytes by injecting the oocyte with total rat cerebellar messenger RNA (mRNA). Co-injection of total mRNA with antisense oligonucleotides to synaptophysin message decreased the expression of synaptophysin in the oocyte and reduced the calcium-dependent secretion. A similar effect on secretion was observed for oocytes injected with total mRNA together with an antibody to rat synaptophysin. These results indicate that synaptophysin is necessary for transmitter secretion and that the oocyte expression system may be useful for dissecting the molecular events associated with the secretory process.
https://openalex.org/W1574013273,"In this paper we describe the isolation and characterization of four monoclonal antibodies (FRP5, FSP16, FWP51, and FSP77) which specifically recognize the human erbB-2 protein. All of the antibodies recognize epitopes on the extracellular domain of the receptor protein. FRP5 and FSP16 compete with one another for binding while FWP51 and FSP77 each recognize a different epitope. The effects of the antibodies on the erbB-2 receptor protein have been analyzed. Two different erbB-2-expressing cell lines, SKBR3 breast tumor cells and HC11 R111 cells, were examined. The SKBR3 cells express approximately 1 x 10(6) molecules of the erbB-2 protein/cell; HC11 R111 cells, a clone of mouse mammary epithelial cells derived by transfection of a human erbB-2 expression plasmid, contain 10-fold less erbB-2 protein than the SKBR3 cells. Treatment of the two cell lines with FRP5, FSP16, and FWP51 led to a rapid increase in the phosphotyrosine content of the erbB-2 protein. Three of the antibodies, FRP5, FSP16, and FSP77, stimulated the turnover of the erbB-2 protein. Binding of the antibodies did not stimulate DNA synthesis in HC11 R111 cells. Thus, the erbB-2-specific monoclonal antibodies behave as partial ligand agonists. The antibodies were examined for their effects upon the growth of SKBR3 and HC11 R111 cells. The growth of SKBR3 cells was inhibited by 90% following long term treatment of the cells with FSP77."
https://openalex.org/W1985573675,"The involvement of synaptophysin, a synaptic vesicle-specific protein, in transmitter release at neuromuscular synapses was studied by intracellular application of synaptophysin antibodies into presynaptic neurons. Polyclonal antibodies or their Fab fragments were loaded into spinal neurons by injection into one of the early blastomeres of Xenopus embryos 1 day prior to culturing or, alternatively, directly through a whole-cell recording pipette at the soma of cultured neurons. At synapses made by antibody-loaded neurons in culture, the spontaneous synaptic currents showed marked reduction in frequency without significant change in their mean amplitude. The impulse-evoked synaptic currents showed reduced amplitude and increased failure rate. These results suggest that interference with synaptophysin function by antibody binding inhibits transmitter secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1583668498,"The refolding of the tetrameric enzyme tryptophanase was facilitated by the chaperonin GroE. Maximum refolding yield of tryptophanase molecules (about 80%) was attained in the presence of a 15-fold excess of GroE 21-mer over tryptophanase monomer. The GroEL subunit was required for this improvement in refolding yield, whereas the GroES subunit was not. Light scattering experiments of the refolding reaction revealed that GroE bound to tryptophanase folding intermediates and suppressed their aggregation. The presence of ATP was required for the efficient dissociation of tryptophanase from GroEL. However, our experiments indicated that tryptophanase dissociated readily from GroEL in the presence of not only ATP, but also in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues such as ATP gamma S (adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)) and AMP-PNP (adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate) as well. Surprisingly, the release of tryptophanase from GroEL was facilitated in the presence of ADP as well. We concluded that the binding of nucleotides such as ATP and ADP changed the conformation of GroEL and facilitated the dissociation of tryptophanase molecules. The conformation formed in the presence of ADP was distinct from the conformation formed in the presence of ATP, as shown by the selective dissociation of various folding proteins from the two conformations."
https://openalex.org/W1584796599,"Loricrin is the major protein component of the cornified cell envelope of terminally differentiated mammalian epidermal (stratum corneum) cells. Using a specific human cDNA clone, we have isolated and characterized the human loricrin gene. We show that it has a very simple structure of a single intron of 1188 base pairs (bp) in the 5'-untranslated region; there are no introns in coding sequences. By use of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, followed by in situ hybridization with a biotin-labeled genomic DNA clone, the single-copy gene maps to chromosome location 1q21. Polymerase chain reaction analyses of genomic DNAs from different individuals show that human loricrin consists of two allelic size variants, due to sequence variations in its second glycine loop domain, and these variants segregate in the human population by normal Mendelian mechanisms. Furthermore, there are multiple sequence variants within these two size class alleles due to various deletions of 12 bp (4 amino acids) in the major loop of this glycine loop domain. By use of a specific loricrin antibody, we show by immunogold electron microscopy that loricrin initially appears in the granular layer of human epidermis and forms composite keratohyalin granules with profilaggrin, but localizes to the cell periphery (cell envelope) of fully differentiated stratum corneum cells."
https://openalex.org/W1482559205,"Molecular chaperones are involved in protein folding both in vivo and in vitro. The Escherichia coli chaperone GroEL interacts with a number of nonnative proteins. A common structural motif of nonnative proteins, which is recognized by GroEL, has not yet been identified. In order to study the role of beta-sheet secondary structure on the interaction of nonnative proteins with GroEL, we used the F(ab) fragment of a monoclonal antibody as a model substrate protein. Here we show that GroEL interacts functionally with this all-beta-protein during reactivation. Antibody fragments refold spontaneously in good yield from the guanidine-denatured state. Functional refolding to the native state is inhibited transiently by GroEL, but there is no complete folding arrest in the absence of Mg-ATP and GroES. The yield of these unspecifically released GroEL-bound F(ab) fragments corresponds to that of the spontaneous reactivation in the absence of chaperones. However, the refolding kinetics in the presence of GroEL are considerably slower. The addition of Mg-ATP to the GroEL.F(ab) complex results in an immediate release of bound substrate protein and a significant increase in the amount of reconstituted antibody fragments compared to spontaneous reactivation. GroES is not essential for functional GroEL-mediated refolding of the F(ab) fragment but affects the reactivation yield to a small extent. Interestingly, stimulation of the GroEL-mediated F(ab) refolding depends primarily on the binding and not on hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphates. Previous results indicate the binding of alpha-helices to GroEL. The results presented in this paper suggest that beta-sheet secondary structural elements are recognized by GroEL. We therefore conclude that the interaction of a nonnative protein with GroEL depends mainly on the nature of the early folding intermediate but not on a specific element of secondary structure."

The exonuclease shows high specificity for the poly(A) tail, and it is single strand-specific and requires a 3'-hydroxyl group for its activity. During degradation 5'-AMP is liberated as a product, and a 3'-OH group is left on the last adenosine residue of the remaining poly(A) tail. The activity is inhibited by 5'-AMP and can be competed by poly(A)-containing mRNA or poly(A). Based on these findings we propose a reaction pathway for poly(A) tail removal catalyzed by the HeLa cell poly(A) tail-specific 3' exonuclease."

https://openalex.org/W1533151953,"Inhibition of protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysates occurs in response to a variety of conditions including heme deficiency, addition of oxidants, and heat stress. The inhibition of translation is due to the activation of a heme-regulated protein kinase (HRI) which specifically phosphorylates the alpha-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-2. In this report, immunoadsorption with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and Western blot analysis were used to investigate the interaction of HRI, the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp 90), hsp 70, and the EC1 antigen in rabbit reticulocyte lysates under protein synthesizing conditions. The data indicate that hsp 90, hsp 70, and the EC1 antigen interact with HRI in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The EC1 antigen is a protein that has been demonstrated to be associated with several steroid hormone receptor-hsp 90 complexes and reacts with the KN 382/EC1 mAb (EC1). The association of HRI with hsp 90 and the EC1 antigen in the reticulocyte lysate was found to be dependent on the presence of hemin at a concentration of 5 microM or higher; little HRI was coadsorbed by the 8D3 anti-hsp 90 mAb or the EC1 mAb in the absence of hemin. Hsp 70 remains associated with HRI in the absence of hemin, suggesting that hsp 90 and 70 may bind to HRI at different sites. The immunological properties of the hsp 70 associated with HRI indicate that it may be the constitutively express heat shock cognate protein (hsc 73). The results suggest that the association of HRI with hsp 90 and the EC1 antigen may be in a dynamic equilibrium, in which complex formation is either facilitated or stabilized by the presence of hemin, and supports the notion that these proteins in conjunction with hsp 70 may play a role in regulating HRI activity or activation in situ."
https://openalex.org/W1499848412,"Methanogenic archaebacteria respond to osmotic stress by accumulating a series of organic molecules which function as compatible solutes. In two strains of marine methanogenic archaebacteria, Methanogenium cariaci and Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus, four key organic solutes are observed: L-alpha-glutamate, beta-glutamate, N epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine, and betaine. The first three of these are synthesized de novo; betaine is transported into the Mg. cariaci cells from the medium. Mesophilic Mg. cariaci will preferentially transport betaine from the extracellular medium if it is present to counterbalance the external NaCl. In its absence it synthesizes N epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine as the dominant osmolyte. This zwitterionic compound occurs at levels in Mg. cariaci which are considerably greater (based on mumol/mg of protein) than in Mc. thermolithotrophicus grown in media of the same ionic strength. Intracellular potassium ion concentrations, determined by 39K NMR spectroscopy and atomic absorption, differ significantly in the two cells. In Mc. thermolithotrophicus, intracellular K+ is balanced by the total concentration of anionic amino acid species, glutamate, and beta-glutamate. Turnover of the organic solutes has been monitored using 13C-pulse/12C-chase, and 15N-pulse/14N-chase experiments. Both beta-amino acids exhibit slower turnover rates when compared to L-alpha-glutamate or aspartate, consistent with their roles as compatible solutes. Biosynthetic information for the beta-amino acids is also provided by 13C-labeling experiments. beta-Glutamate shows a lag in 13C uptake from 13CO2, indicative of its biosynthesis from a precursor (probably a macromolecule) not in equilibrium with the soluble L-alpha-glutamate pool. Confirmation of a novel route for beta-glutamate synthesis and the production of the beta-lysine moiety from the diaminopimelate pathway is deduced from [13C2]acetate labeling patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1522820056,"The chaperonin protein cpn60 from Escherichia coli protects the monomeric, mitochondrial enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase, EC 2.8.1.1) against heat inactivation. The thermal inactivation of rhodanese was studied for four different states of the enzyme: native, refolded, bound to cpn60 in the form of a binary complex formed from unfolded rhodanese, and a thermally perturbed state. Thermal stabilization is observed in a range of temperatures from 25 to 48 degrees C. Rhodanese that had been inactivated by incubation at 48 degrees C, in the presence of cpn60 can be reactivated at 25 degrees C, upon addition of cpn10, K+, and MgATP. A recovery of about 80% was achieved after 1 h of the addition of those components. Thus, the enzyme is protected against heat inactivation and kept in a reactivable form if inactivation is attempted using the binary complex formed between rhodanese folding intermediate(s) and cpn60. The chaperonin-assisted refolding of urea-denatured rhodanese is dependent on the temperature of the refolding reaction. However, optimal chaperonin assisted refolding of rhodanese observed at 25 degrees C, which is achieved upon addition of cpn10 and ATP to the cpn60-rhodanese complex, is independent of the temperature of preincubation of the complex, that was formed previously at low temperature. The results are in agreement with a model in which the chaperonin cpn60 interacts with partly folded intermediates by forming a binary complex which is stable to elevated temperatures. In addition, it appears that native rhodanese can be thermally perturbed to produce a state different from that achieved by denaturation that can interact with cpn60."
https://openalex.org/W1935267578,"Genomic clones covering the entire sequence of the gene encoding human D-amino-acid oxidase (DAO) (EC 1.4.3.3), one of the principal and characteristic flavoenzymes of peroxisomes, were isolated from human placental genomic libraries with the aid of a previously cloned cDNA for human DAO as a probe. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the gene, present as a single copy in the human genome, comprises 11 exons and spans 20 kilobase pairs. The protein sequences containing the catalytically important residues, Tyr-228 and His-307, are coded for by separate exons. Heterologous transcription initiation sites were identified by primer extension analysis, and the sequence of the 5'-flanking region of the DAO gene was found to show some features common to other mammalian genes, such as those of glucocorticoid and the cAMP-responsive element. An additional noteworthy feature is the presence of promoter-like sequences in the first intron of the gene. In addition, two sequences of alternating pyrimidine and purine nucleotides, (CA)20 and (CA)17, are also present in the first intron. Such sequences may play some role in the expression of the DAO gene in human tissues. With the use of genomic DNAs prepared from human and Chinese hamster somatic hybrid cells as templates for the polymerase chain reaction, the gene for DAO was localized to human chromosome 12."
https://openalex.org/W2076066797,"Innervation of nerve and muscle cells during development is often accompanied by changes in the expression and function of ion channels in the postsynaptic cell. However, the signaling pathways whereby the presynaptic nerve influences the properties of the postsynaptic cell are less well understood. Indirect evidence suggests that cardiac voltage-gated Na+ channels undergo important changes during development. Here, we compare directly single voltage-gated Na+ channel currents from neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocytes and report a negative shift in the voltage dependence of channel gating during development, leading to a significant speeding of channel activation and inactivation at a fixed membrane potential. These developmental changes can be mimicked in vitro by innervation of neonatal myocytes with sympathetic neurons. The effect of sympathetic neurons is blocked by the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol and is mimicked by prolonged coculture of neonatal myocytes with a membrane-permeable cAMP analog. Thus presynaptic neurons can control the developmental phenotype of ion channels in a postsynaptic cell through a classic receptor-mediated neurotransmitter action that involves a defined second messenger pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1603103625,"Transcription of the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) gene is rapidly elevated by activation of protein kinase A (PKA). The additive influence of three cis-acting elements is responsible for this regulation in an adrenal carcinoma cell line. Two sites, CRE2 at -48 base pairs (bp) relative to the start of transcription and CRE3 at +95 bp, are identical to the core motif of the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) of the somatostatin gene and are conserved in the mouse, rat, and human ODC genes. Mutation of CRE2 resulted in a substantial decrease in basal promoter activity, as well as a 5-fold decrease in inducibility of the ODC promoter by PKA. CRE3 did not contribute to the basal activity of the ODC promoter, but mutation of this site resulted in a 2-fold decrease in inducibility by PKA. Deletion of a 45-bp sequence (GC-box) located 5' of CRE2, also resulted in a 2-fold decrease in inducibility of the ODC promoter. DNase I protection revealed the presence of protein binding at CRE2, the TATA box, and the GC-box of the ODC promoter. Mutation of CRE2 resulted in loss of protection of this sequence, as well as the 3' extension of the footprint over the TATA box, without affecting interactions at the GC box. Antibodies to the well characterized CRE-binding protein CREB recognized proteins binding to CRE2, suggesting that binding of CREB, or an antigenically related protein, is important for the activity of CRE2. Additionally, recombinant CREB bound to a DNA probe containing the CRE2 sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1536363529,"The nature of the interaction of cloned alpha 2a-adrenergic receptors from LLC-PK1-O clone cells with G proteins was investigated using an immunoprecipitation approach. Following solubilization of the alpha 2a receptors, antiserum 8730, which is directed against the C-terminal region of Gi alpha, immunoprecipitated alpha 2a receptor-Gi alpha complexes. The immunoprecipitation was specific since it could be blocked by the peptide to which antiserum 8730 was generated. Antisera 3646 (anti-Gi alpha 1), 1521 (anti-Gi alpha 2), and 1518 (anti-Gi alpha 3) immunoprecipitated solubilized alpha 2a receptor-Gi alpha complexes, indicating that all three Gi alpha subtypes couple with the alpha 2a receptor. Antiserum 9072, which is directed against the C-terminal region of G(o)alpha, immunoprecipitated solubilized alpha 2a receptor-G alpha complexes indicating that these receptors are also coupled to G(o)alpha. Antiserum 8132, which is directed against G beta 36, immunoprecipitated solubilized alpha 2a receptors while the G beta 35 antiserum 8129, did not, indicating that alpha 2a receptors selectively associate with G beta 36. The binding of the partial agonist p-aminoclonidine to the solubilized alpha 2a receptor alters the association of the receptor with G proteins. Following p-aminoclonidine binding to the solubilized alpha 2a receptor, the ability of the C-terminal directed G alpha antisera 8730 and 9072 to coimmunoprecipitate the alpha 2a receptor-G alpha complex was greatly reduced. The effect of p-aminoclonidine was concentration dependent, mimicked by the full agonist UK 14304 and blocked by the alpha 2 receptor antagonist yohimbine. In contrast, antisera directed against internal regions of Gi alpha and G(o)alpha, immunoprecipitated the agonist-bound and agonist-free alpha 2a receptor equally well. These findings indicate that following the binding of agonists to the alpha 2a receptor, Gi alpha and G(o)alpha remain physically associated with the receptor but either the conformation of G alpha linked to the receptor or the conformation of the receptor itself is modified such that the epitope for the C-terminal directed anti-Gi alpha and anti-G(o)alpha antisera are not accessible. These agonist-induced conformational changes in the alpha 2a receptor-G alpha complex may be important for the activation of the G protein and the stimulation of the alpha 2a receptor signal transduction pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2145832080,"We have recently reported that glucagon activated the L-type Ca2+ channel current in frog ventricular myocytes and showed that this was linked to the inhibition of a membrane-bound low-Km cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) (Mery, P. F., Brechler, V., Pavoine, C., Pecker, F., and Fischmeister, R. (1990) Nature 345, 158-161). We show here that the inhibition of membrane-bound PDE activity by glucagon depends on guanine nucleotides, a reproducible inhibition of 40% being obtained with 0.1 microM glucagon in the presence of 10 microM GTP, with GTP greater than GTP gamma S, while GDP and ATP gamma S were without effect. Glucagon had no effect on the cytosolic low-Km cAMP PDE, assayed with or without 10 microM GTP. Glucagon inhibition of membrane-bound PDE activity was not affected by pretreatment of the ventricle particulate fraction with cholera toxin. However, it was abolished after pertussis toxin pretreatment. Mastoparan, a wasp venom peptide known to activate G(i)/G(o) proteins directly, mimicked the effect of glucagon. PDE inhibition by glucagon was additive with the inhibition induced by Ro 20-1724, but was prevented by milrinone. This was correlated with an increase by glucagon of cAMP levels in frog ventricular cells which was not additive with the increase in cAMP due to milrinone. We conclude that glucagon specifically inhibits the cGMP-inhibited, milrinone-sensitive PDE (CGI-PDE). Insensitivity of adenylylcyclase to glucagon and inhibition by the peptide of a low-Km cAMP PDE were not restricted to frog heart, but also occurred in mouse and guinea pig heart. These results confirm that two mechanisms mediate the action of glucagon in heart: one is the activation of adenylylcyclase through Gs, and the other relies on the inhibition of the membrane-bound low-Km CGI-PDE, via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein."

https://openalex.org/W1601744055,"The proposed active-site base Cys-378 of thiolase, responsible for deprotonation of acetyl-CoA, has been converted to a less acidic residue Ser-378 by mutagenesis. Comparison of the CD spectra and dimethyl suberimidate cross-linking experiments of the wild type, mutant Ser-378, and Gly-378 enzymes indicated that there have been no major conformational changes. The Ser-378 enzyme retains 0.1% of the Vmax of wild type in the direction of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolytic cleavage and 0.07% of the Vmax in the Claisen condensation direction. Analysis of the acetyl S-enzyme intermediate partitioning, that is capture of the acetyl enzyme by 1) the thiolate of coenzyme A relative to 2) the C-2 carbanion of acetyl-CoA, is changed to favor reaction 2 in the case of the Ser-378 mutant enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1528819768,"We have recently reported the expression in Escherichia coli of an enzymatically competent ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase from cloned pea genes encoding either the mature enzyme or its precursor protein (Ceccarelli, E. A., Viale, A. M., Krapp, A. R., and Carrillo, N. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 14283-14287). Processing to the mature form by bacterial protease(s) and FAD assembly occurred in the bacterial cytosol. Expression of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase in chaperonin-deficient (groE-) mutants of E. coli resulted in partial reductase assembly at permissive growth temperatures (i.e. 30 degrees C), and in total breakdown of holoenzyme assembly, and accumulation as aggregated inclusion bodies at non-permissive temperatures (i.e. 42 degrees C). Coexpression in these mutants of a cloned groESL operon from the phototrophic bacterium Chromatium vinosum resulted in partial or total recoveries of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase assembly. The overall results indicate that bacterial chaperonins are required for the productive folding/assembly of eucaryotic ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase expressed in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1555520902,"A somatostatin (SRIF) receptor and its associated Gi regulatory proteins was purified from GH4C1 rat pituitary cells by: 1) saturation of the membrane-bound receptor with biotinyl-NH-[Leu8,D-Trp22,Tyr25] SRIF28 (bio-S28); 2) solubilization of receptor-ligand (R.L) complex with deoxycholate-lysophosphatidylcholine (D.L); 3) adsorption of solubilized receptor-ligand complex to immobilized streptavidin; and 4) elution of receptor and G-protein by GTP. The receptor, a glycoprotein with an average M(r) of 85,000, was then purified to substantial homogeneity on immobilized wheat germ agglutinin. The 85-kDa glycoprotein was identified as a SRIF receptor by several criteria. (a) It had the same size as the chemically cross-linked R.[125I]L complex. (b) Yield of the purified protein increased and plateaued in the same range of bio-S28 concentrations where specific high affinity binding reached saturation. (c) It was copurified with appropriate G-protein subunits. The 85-kDa receptor and two other proteins with M(r) values of 35,000 and 40,000, the sizes of G beta and G alpha, did not appear in eluates from control streptavidin columns done with SRIF receptors loaded with nonbiotinylated S14. The 40-kDa protein was identified as a Gi alpha by ADP-ribosylation from [32P]NAD catalyzed by pertussis toxin. (d) Both the chemically cross-linked R.[125I]L complex and SRIF receptor purified from [35S]methionine-labeled GH4C1 cells were reduced in size to about 38 kDa by endoglycosidase F. (e) Amino acid sequence from the purified receptor was nearly identical with that of a recently cloned SRIF receptor subtype."
https://openalex.org/W1484828545,"We have synthesized a novel heteropolymer double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule of defined length and strandedness (dsRNA309) and evaluated its ability to induce cytokine gene expression, activate dsRNA-dependent enzymes, and inhibit both tumor cell growth and virus replication. Unlike the conventionally studied synthetic homopolymer dsRNAs, polyinosinic acid:polycytidylic acid (poly(I-C)) and its mismatched analogue polyinosinic:polycytidylic, uridylic acid (poly(I-C12,U), dsRNA309 possessed restricted biological activity. dsRNA309 was unable to inhibit tumor cell growth or efficiently induce cytokine (i.e. interferon-beta and interleukin-1 alpha) gene expression. However, dsRNA309 was able to inhibit virus replication and activate dsRNA-dependent intracellular enzymes, 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2'-5' A synthetase) and the dsRNA-activated inhibitor kinase in in vitro assay systems. Overall, dsRNA309 provided a means for examining the mechanisms governing the dsRNA-regulated antiviral and antiproliferative responses, and studies with dsRNA309 demonstrated that the ability of a synthetic dsRNA to activate dsRNA-dependent intracellular enzymes does not necessarily predict the same gene inducing capacity."
