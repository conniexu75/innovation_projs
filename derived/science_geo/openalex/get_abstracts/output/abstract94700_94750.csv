https://openalex.org/W1603479071,"The binding of rabbit skeletal muscle troponin-T and several of its fragments to various types of tropomyosin immobilized on Sepharose 4B affinity columns equilibrated with 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.0 buffer has been investigated. With rabbit skeletal muscle alpha-tropomyosin, intact troponin-T was eluted with an NaCl gradient at 0.42 M, while its fragments T1 (residues 1-158) and CB1 (residues 1-151) were eluted at 0.32 M NaCl in either or Ca2+ buffer in the presence of troponin-C. Fragment T2 (residues 159-259) was eluted at 0.22 M NaCl in minus Ca2+ buffer in the presence of troponin-C, but in the void volume with troponin-C under plus Ca2+ conditions. With immobilized nonpolymerizable alpha-tropomyosin, T1 was not bound, whereas T2 was eluted at the same NaCl concentration (0.21 M) as with alpha-tropomyosin. This binding was sensitive to Ca2+ in the presence of troponin-C. The results are consistent with a structural interpretation of a two-site model of troponin attachment to alpha-tropomyosin (Mak, A. S., and Smillie, L. B. (1981) J. Mol. Biol. 149, 541-550). With beta-tropomyosin from rabbit skeletal muscle and with tropomyosins from equine platelets and chicken gizzard, the binding of fragment T1 was not observed at 0.1 M NaCl, while that for T2 was the same as for rabbit skeletal alpha-tropomyosin and remained Ca2+-sensitive in the presence of troponin-C. In the case of bovine aorta tropomyosin, neither T1 nor T2 was bound under these conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1590075612,"Monomer proteoglycans isolated from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma contain O- and N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides. The O-glycosidically linked ones were released from the protein core by alkaline borohydride treatment. After removal of sialic acid, the resulting oligosaccharide alditols were converted to N-trifluoroacetyl derivatives by trifluoroacetolysis. The N-trifluoroacetylated oligosaccharide alditols show shorter retention time on gas-liquid chromatography, as permethylated derivatives, than the corresponding N-acetyl derivatives. The mass spectra of these new derivatives also give more structural information and provide definitive structures. Alkaline borohydride treatment of the proteoglycans also released N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide-peptides. These were purified and analyzed by Smith degradation, trifluoroacetolysis, and chromium trioxide oxidation. The results indicate that more than 70% of the N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides have the following structure: (formula, see text) with the Fuc present on only about 60% of the oligosaccharides."

https://openalex.org/W1564053374,"The nontransformed (molybdate-stabilized) avian oviduct progesterone receptor has been purified to near homogeneity by a simple four-step procedure: ammonium sulfate fractionation, affinity chromatography, gel filtration, and DEAE-Sephadex A-25 chromatography. The affinity resin (deoxycorticosterone-agarose) is very resistant to chemical breakdown and enzymatic destruction and can be used repeatedly. The material obtained after gel filtration was separated into two receptor components by DEAE-chromatography. The two components, termed I and II, are obtained in about 18% yield and are purified by about 6000-fold (I) and 4000-fold (II). They are highly purified as only a single major Coomassie blue-stained polypeptide of about Mr = 90,000 in both components I and II is seen on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis plus a second band of Mr = 104,000 which is seen only in component II. Both purified receptor components have sedimentation coefficients of 8 S in glycerol gradients containing molybdate (10 mM). In the absence of molybdate, however, both receptor forms have sedimentation coefficients of about 4 S in gradients containing 300 mM KCl. Therefore, stabilization of the 8 S form by molybdate is still evident in highly purified receptor preparations. The Stokes radii, binding specificity, and steroid dissociation rate of purified receptor are similar to those found in crude cytosol. These results confirm our previous observation on the existence of two 8 S forms of the progesterone receptor and show that these molybdate-stabilized forms remain intact throughout purification."
https://openalex.org/W1580549174,"The ability of almond emulsion peptide:N-glycosidase to remove oligosaccharide chains from intact glycoproteins was studied. Protein conformation appeared to be the main factor affecting carbohydrate removal. In the native state the oligosaccharides of ribonuclease B and the Fab mu fragment derived from immunoglobulin M were completely resistant to the enzyme, indicating that the polypeptide chain restricts access to the site of hydrolysis. Heat denaturation in sodium dodecyl sulfate rendered these glycoproteins susceptible to peptide:N-glycosidase, but perturbation with chaotropic salts provided a more gentle approach, which was as effective as detergent-unfolding and more compatible with the stability of the enzyme. Once exposed by the unfolding reagents, the complex oligosaccharides of Fab mu were released more rapidly than the high mannose chains of ribonuclease B, consistent with their preferential release from small glycopeptides (Plummer, T. H., Jr., and Tarentino, A. L. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10243-10246)."
https://openalex.org/W1597638835,"Control of coenzyme A synthesis was studied in isolated, perfused rat hearts. Pantothenic acid (PA), coenzyme A, and intermediates in the the pathway were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography. The amount of 14C label in each of the metabolites was determined in tissue extracts when [14C]PA was supplied in the perfusate. The rate-controlling steps in the pathway were determined by measuring the net rate of [14C]PA flux through each of the reactions. The data indicated that the primary site of control in the pathway was the pantothenate kinase-catalyzed reaction, the first intracellular step in the conversion of PA to CoA. The rate of this reaction was inhibited by including glucose, pyruvate, fatty acids, or beta-hydroxybutyrate in the perfusate of isolated hearts. Pyruvate and beta-hydroxybutyrate caused a much greater inhibition than did glucose. Insulin was a strong inhibitor, but only in the presence of glucose. Insulin had no effect in hearts receiving either no substrate or palmitate as substrate. Collectively, these data indicated that an unknown tissue metabolite whose level changed with each of these substrates and insulin is a strong regulator of pantothenate kinase. Synthesis of CoA occurred in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments. Accelerated mitochondrial CoA synthesis appeared to be dependent upon the production and accumulation of 4'-phosphopantotheine, which occurred only when pantothenate kinase was stimulated."

https://openalex.org/W2097378349,"Treatment of rats with the beta-agonist isoproterenol causes a dramatic increase in a series of proteins rich in proline (proline-rich proteins) in the parotid glands (Muenzer, J., Bildstein, C., Gleason, M., and Carlson, D. M. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 5623, 5629). These proteins which contain about 43% proline, comprise more than 50% of the total soluble protein of glands of rats treated with isoproterenol for 10 days. Further studies by in vitro translation analysis using the reticulocyte lysate system and labeling with [3H]proline or [35S]methionine show definitive changes in patterns of protein synthesis and proline-rich protein mRNAs are highly elevated in treated animals. Analysis of translation products by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed (1) very little synthesis of proline-rich proteins from poly(A+) RNA of glands of normal rats, (2) poly(A+) RNA from glands of treated animals synthesize mainly proline-rich proteins, (3) translations with [3H]proline and [35S]methionine give identical labeling patterns from cell-free translations are all precipitated by antibodies to proline-rich proteins. At least six different proline-rich proteins are translated with poly(A+) mRNA from glands of treated animals. Each of these proteins is likely a translation product of a separate, specific mRNA. The dramatic changes in protein synthesis of rat parotid glands in response to isoproterenol treatment suggest to us that the parotid gland of the isoproterenol-treated rat is an excellent model system to study the overall responsiveness of gene expression to catecholamines."

Peptide fragments formed by cleavage at arginine, glutamic acid, and methionine residues were analyzed by Edman degradation or digestion with carboxypeptidase. The complete primary structure of human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase was established by sequence analysis of 17 peptide fragments, 15 of which were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The enzyme is 217 residues long with a molecular weight equal to 24,470. Mass spectroscopy indicated that the NH2-terminal alanine is acetylated."

https://openalex.org/W1596171517,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion was investigated in intact cells isolated in vitro. Parathyroid cells from bovine parathyroid glands were obtained through tissue dispersion and cell purification through isotonic Percoll gradients, a newly developed protocol enhancing cell homogeneity and viability. Isolated cells maintained both metabolic viability and plasma membrane intactness for over 3 h at 37 degrees C, as shown by the large ATP/ADP ratios and the high intracellular K+ content (ouabain-sensitive) measured. The rate of PTH secretion was inversely related to the Ca2+ concentrations in the medium; secretion was 54 and 18 ng PTH/mg of protein/min when free Ca2+ in the buffer was 0.8 and 2 mM, respectively. At either Ca2+ concentration, PTH secretion was strongly dependent on cell metabolism; it was inhibited by 80-85% within 10 min when cells were suspended in glucose-free buffer containing either cyanide or oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler. Under these conditions, both cellular ATP production and calcium-dependent PTH release could be partially restored by addition of 5 mM glucose. La3+, Mn2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, and Mg2+ were each tested in a range of 0.5-2.5 mM for their effects in suppressing low calcium-stimulated secretion. La3+ and Mn2+ were about twice as effective as Ca2+ on a molar basis, Sr2+ was similar to Ca2+, Mg2+ was about half as effective, and Ba2+ had almost no effect. These results suggest that the Ca2+-dependent stimulus-secretion coupling of these cells is largely different from that established in other secretory cells and provide an in vitro system to further investigate the regulation of PTH secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1556996781,"Extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy has been applied to the elucidation of the structure of the heme iron site of bacterial cytochrome P-450. The low spin ferric, high spin ferric, ferrous, and ferrous carbonyl states of the enzyme have been examined. Curve-fitting analysis of the data provides direct and compelling evidence for the presence of a sulfur atom in the first coordination sphere of the iron. The iron-nitrogen (porphyrin) distances indicate five coordination in high spin ferric and ferrous P-450 and six coordination in low spin ferric and ferrous carbonyl P-450. The iron-sulfur distances are consistent with thiolate ligation, presumably from cysteinate, in all four states of the enzyme. In each case, the iron-sulfur bond distance is equal to or shorter than the analogous Fe-S bonds in model iron porphyrin thiolate complexes whose crystal structures have been determined. Since known thiol-sulfur:iron-heme bond distances are noticeably longer than the corresponding thiolate bonds, the X-ray absorption fine structure results strongly suggest that, in each P-450 state examined, the sulfur donor is a thiolate. The results reported in this paper concerning the ligand identity, state of protonation, and metal-ligand bond distances are of critical importance to a complete description of the P-450 reaction cycle and its mechanism of oxygen activation."
https://openalex.org/W88711427,"High density lipoproteins of rat blood plasma were labeled in vitro with radioiodinated apolipoprotein E and biologically with [3H]cholesteryl esters. These two components, present in high density lipoproteins separated from serum of normal or cholesterol-fed rats by molecular sieve chromatography, were removed slowly from perfused livers and the labeled apolipoprotein E was also removed slowly from the blood of intact rats. However, when labeled serum was subjected to ultracentrifugation at a density of 1.21 g/ml before the floating apolipoprotein E-labeled high density lipoproteins were separated by chromatography, the labeled protein was rapidly removed from the blood of intact rats by uptake into the liver. About one-half of the labeled apolipoprotein E associated with high density lipoproteins was dissociated during ultracentrifugation, but most of it reassociated with the these lipoproteins when the floating lipoproteins were remixed with the sedimented serum proteins. The apolipoprotein E in such reassociated high density lipoproteins was removed from the blood of intact rats at the slow rate observed when the high density lipoproteins were separated chromatographically from whole serum. About 90% of the labeled apolipoprotein E in uncentrifuged or centrifuged high density lipoproteins was shown by affinity chromatography to be associated with particles containing apolipoprotein A-I. Rapid hepatic uptake of apolipoprotein E in centrifuged high density lipoproteins may result from an altered conformation of the apolipoprotein E on the particle surface."

https://openalex.org/W1927641008,"Two alpha-ketoaldehyde dehydrogenases, one catalyzing the oxidation of methylglyoxal to pyruvate with NAD and the other with NADP, were isolated from goat liver and happened to be co-purified. Both the enzymes had been extensively purified to the point where only these two enzymes were present. By affinity chromatography on a thiol-Sepharose column, the two enzymes were separated. Molecular weight of both the enzymes was found to be 42,000 by gel filtration in a Sephadex G-200 column. Electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel revealed that the enzymes are composed of single subunits. Interaction with mercurials indicated the presence of SH group(s) in the active site of the NAD-linked enzyme only."

https://openalex.org/W1577895629,"A previous report from this laboratory demonstrated that the majority of phosphatidylcholine in hamster heart was formed from choline via the CDP-choline pathway (Zelinski, T. A., Savard, J. D., Man, R. Y. K., and Choy, P. C. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11423-11428). In this study, phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in myopathic hamster hearts was compared with date-matched controls. Upon perfusion with [Me-3H]choline, a 22% increase in labeling of phosphatidylcholine was observed in the hearts of 150-200-day-old myopathic hamsters. However, total cardiac phosphatidylcholine remained unchanged. In order to elucidate the cause for the increase in labeling of phosphatidylcholine during cardiomyopathy, the intermediates for phosphatidylcholine formation in the myopathic hearts were analyzed. The labeling and pool size of CDP-choline in the myopathic hearts were found to be 72 and 60% of the controls. This uneven reduction caused a 20% increase in the specific radioactivity of CDP-choline. Since CDP-choline is the immediate precursor for phosphatidylcholine formation, it can be concluded that the increase in labeling of phosphatidylcholine in the myopathic heart was a direct reflection on the specific radioactivity of CDP-choline. Furthermore, the net amount of phosphatidylcholine synthesized was estimated to be similar between the normal and myopathic hearts. The reduction in CDP-choline formation was probably caused by an observed decrease in CTP concentration in cardiomyopathy. However, phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity was elevated. The enhanced enzyme activity is regarded as one of the compensatory mechanism for the myopathic heart to maintain a minimum CDP-choline level, in order to prevent reduction of net phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1533844293,"Interaction of certain metal ions with prothrombin and prothrombin fragment 1 has been shown to result in conformational change(s). Self-association of prothrombin and prothrombin fragment 1 in the presence of divalent cations has been reported. The present study has made use of a covalent cross-linking reagent, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), to study the self-association of prothrombin in the presence of divalent cations. In the presence of certain divalent cations, prothrombin dimer is the product of such cross-linking. Optimal dimerization of bovine prothrombin requires preincubation with calcium ions prior to the addition of cross-linking reagent. Calcium ions are also required for dimerization after this preincubation period. A similar time dependence is not seen with human prothrombin. The dimerization of bovine prothrombin is also supported by strontium and gadolinium to an extent comparable to that of calcium and to a lesser extent by barium or manganese. Magnesium ions do not support dimerization. The results suggest that certain divalent cations either induce or stabilize a conformation of prothrombin which can self-associate to form dimers. The results further suggest that divalent cations are also necessary for the actual cross-linking process subsequent to this conformational change."
https://openalex.org/W1487659184,"The corneal epithelia isolated from 19-day-old chick embryos were incubated with [35S]sulfate and [3H]glucosamine. More than 95% of the isotope-labeled sulfated glycoconjugates were extracted with 4 M guanidine/HCl, 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0, and 0.5% Triton X-100 and separated on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B into two major fractions, i.e. sulfated glycoprotein and sulfated proteoglycan fractions. Mild alkali treatment of the sulfated proteoglycan fraction and characterization of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans enabled the identification of heparan sulfate ([35S], 81%; [3H], 91%) and chondroitin sulfate ([35S], 19%; [3H], 9%). Fractionation of the sulfated glycoprotein fraction on Sepharose CL-6B resulted in the separation of four sulfated glycoproteins with apparent molecular weights of 70,000, 130,000, 280,000, and over 2,000,000. The products of alkaline borohydride treatment of the sulfated glycoproteins separated into three fractions on Sephadex G-75, two fractions contained sulfated oligosaccharides, and the third one contained inorganic sulfate and N-acetyl-galactosaminitol. Incorporation of [35S]sulfate into higher molecular weight fraction of the two fractions was selectively inhibited by tunicamycin, whereas that incorporated into the smaller molecular weight fraction was not inhibited by the drug and, rather, was activated. These results suggest that the former contains N-glycosidically linked sulfated glycopeptides, and the latter is derived from O-glycosidically linked sulfated oligosaccharide side chains."
https://openalex.org/W1527680180,"During spermatogenesis in the winter flounder, the average repeat length of nucleosomal DNA in the testis increases from 195 +/- 2 base pairs in prespermatid nuclei to 222 +/- 3 base pairs in sperm. This increase in repeat length apparently occurs in the linker region since there is no change in the pattern of DNA fragments produced during micrococcal nuclease digestion of the nucleosome core. The timing of the increase coincides with the loss of phosphate from the high molecular weight basic nuclear proteins and histones H2A and H4. When prespermatid nuclei are digested with micrococcal nuclease to the point where 10% of the DNA is acid-soluble, mononucleosomes and higher oligomers are readily released. However, when sperm chromatin is digested to the same extent, these products are no longer soluble and only traces of H1 and small DNA fragments are released. This situation is not changed in sperm chromatin that has been depleted of H1 by extraction with 0.4 M NaCl. However, if nuclease-treated sperm chromatin is lightly digested with trypsin, mono- and oligonucleosomes are released. At this level of proteolysis, the high molecular weight basic nuclear proteins are completely broken down, but the core histones are largely intact. These data are consistent with a model in which the unphosphorylated high molecular weight basic nuclear proteins function in cross-linking nucleosomes together within the sperm nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W42899245,"The effect of different nucleotides and glycolytic intermediates was tested on the NAD-linked and NADP-linked alpha-ketoaldehyde dehydrogenases involved in the oxidation of methylglyoxal to pyruvate. ATP, GTP, and ADP strongly inhibit the NAD-linked enzyme whereas activity of the NADP-linked enzyme remained unaltered. NADP at a concentration much below its catalytic concentration strongly inhibited the NAD-linked enzyme. This NADP inhibition decreased with decreasing of the pH of the incubation medium. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate stimulated and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate inhibited the activity of the NAD-linked enzyme whereas dihydroxyacetone phosphate inhibited NADP-linked activity. The stimulatory effect of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate diminished with lowering of the pH value. The various effects by several key metabolites of the glycolytic pathway indicate a possible physiological role for these enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1522222822,"Kinetic studies of the inhibition of rabbit muscle phosphorylase a D-glucan:orthophosphate alpha-D-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.1) by various glucose derivatives indicate that glucose derivatives in the chair conformation (glucose, 2-deoxyglucose, glucosyl fluoride, and 1-O-methylglucose) stabilize the form of phosphorylase a, whereas those in the half-chair conformation (1,5-gluconolactone and glucal) bind to the form. Derivatives which stabilized the T form were generally competitive inhibitors of phosphate binding, were synergistic with caffeine, and weakened AMP binding. Derivatives which bound to the R form were noncompetitive with respect to Pi in the presence of AMP. The mechanism of inhibition of the R form by gluconolactone and glucal appears to depend upon the presence or absence of AMP. In the presence of the nucleotide, gluconolactone is probably a linear mixed-type inhibitor. However, in the absence of AMP, simple linear uncompetitive inhibition was apparent. Since gluconolactone is thought to be an analogue of the substrate transition state of the phosphorylase reaction, a major function of nucleotide in activating phosphorylase may be the formation of the transition state binding pocket in the binary enzyme-glycogen complex. In the absence of AMP, glucal was competitive with respect to phosphate. However, in the presence of nucleotide, simple intersecting linear noncompetitive inhibition was observed. The results indicate that a second function of AMP is the formation of the phosphate binding pocket in the enzyme-glucal-glycogen-AMP complex. This conclusion is consistent with the crystallographic and structural data available at present."
https://openalex.org/W1580199166,"Particulate adenylate cyclase preparations from rat uterine smooth muscle had a single class of [3H]guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate ([3H]GMP.P(NH)P)-binding sites with all of the properties of the guanyl nucleotide-requiring enzyme activation sites (N) which couple hormone receptors and catalytic subunits. These sites bound the radioligand in a reversible manner at low temperature (less than 2 degrees C) but irreversibly at temperatures between 6 and 24 degrees C, properties characteristic of the activation of the enzyme by treatment with GMP.P(NH)P described previously (Krall, J. F., Leshon, S. C., Frolich, M., and Korenman, S. G. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 5436-5442). Temperature affected the number but not the apparent affinity (Kd approximately 1.0 microM) of binding. The time course of the transition from reversible to irreversible binding was coincident with the irreversible activation of the catalytic subunit. The methyl analog of GTP, guanyl-(beta, gamma-methylene)-diphosphate, a poor irreversible activator compared to GMP.P(NH)P in this enzyme system, was a competitive inhibitor of [3H]GMP.P(NH)P binding but with a 10-fold lower affinity (Kd approximately 10 microM). Using these direct radioligand-binding methods, both an inactive (NL) and active (NL*) form of the guanyl nucleotide-binding activation site were demonstrated, and the transition NL leads to NL* was identified as the temperature-dependent event in catalytic subunit (C) activation. The nondissociability of specific [3H]GMP.P(NH)P binding and the irreversible nature of catalytic subunit activation suggest that a complex of NL*.C characterizes the fully activated state of the smooth muscle enzyme."
