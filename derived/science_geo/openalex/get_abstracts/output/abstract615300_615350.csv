https://openalex.org/W2809999132,"Mutations in PIK3CA, which encodes the p110α subunit of the insulin-activated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), and loss of function mutations in PTEN, which encodes a phosphatase that degrades the phosphoinositide lipids generated by PI3K, are among the most frequent events in human cancers1,2. However, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K has resulted in variable clinical responses, raising the possibility of an inherent mechanism of resistance to treatment. As p110α mediates virtually all cellular responses to insulin, targeted inhibition of this enzyme disrupts glucose metabolism in multiple tissues. For example, blocking insulin signalling promotes glycogen breakdown in the liver and prevents glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, resulting in transient hyperglycaemia within a few hours of PI3K inhibition. The effect is usually transient because compensatory insulin release from the pancreas (insulin feedback) restores normal glucose homeostasis3. However, the hyperglycaemia may be exacerbated or prolonged in patients with any degree of insulin resistance and, in these cases, necessitates discontinuation of therapy3-6. We hypothesized that insulin feedback induced by PI3K inhibitors may reactivate the PI3K-mTOR signalling axis in tumours, thereby compromising treatment effectiveness7,8. Here we show, in several model tumours in mice, that systemic glucose-insulin feedback caused by targeted inhibition of this pathway is sufficient to activate PI3K signalling, even in the presence of PI3K inhibitors. This insulin feedback can be prevented using dietary or pharmaceutical approaches, which greatly enhance the efficacy/toxicity ratios of PI3K inhibitors. These findings have direct clinical implications for the multiple p110α inhibitors that are in clinical trials and provide a way to increase treatment efficacy for patients with many types of tumour."

Using developmental, genetic and illness-based RNA sequencing expression analysis in human brain, we characterized the human brain transcriptome around these loci and found enrichment for developmentally regulated genes with novel examples of shifting isoform usage across pre- and postnatal life. We found widespread expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), including many with transcript specificity and previously unannotated sequence that were independently replicated. We leveraged this general eQTL database to show that 48.1% of risk variants for schizophrenia associate with nearby expression. We lastly found 237 genes significantly differentially expressed between patients and controls, which replicated in an independent dataset, implicated synaptic processes, and were strongly regulated in early development. These findings together offer genetics- and diagnosis-related targets for better modeling of schizophrenia risk. This resource is publicly available at http://eqtl.brainseq.org/phase1 ."

Tanaka et al. examined spatial firing properties of neurons in hippocampal area CA1 on the basis of whether they had recently expressed the immediate-early activity-induced gene c-Fos in response to a novel context. The c-Fos–positive neurons displayed a more on-off firing pattern than the c-Fos–negative cells during context discrimination. In a contextual recognition paradigm, these results support the index theory of hippocampal function over a cognitive mapping theory. Science , this issue p. 392"
https://openalex.org/W2884838967,"Overexpression of histone deacetylase (HDAC) isoforms has been implicated in a variety of disease pathologies, from cancer and colitis to cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration, thus HDAC inhibitors have a long history as therapeutic targets. The gut microbiota can influence HDAC activity via microbial-derived metabolites. While HDAC inhibition (HDI) by gut commensals has long been attributed to the short chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate, the potent metabolic reservoir provided by the gut microbiota and its role in host physiology warrants further investigation in a variety of diseases. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) of 79 phylogenetically diverse gut commensals isolated from healthy human donors were screened for their SCFA profile and their total HDAC inhibitory properties. The three most potent HDAC inhibiting strains were further evaluated and subjected to additional analysis of specific class I and class II HDAC inhibition. All three HDAC inhibitors are butyrate producing strains, and one of these also produced substantial levels of valeric acid and hexanoic acid. Valeric acid was identified as a potential contributor to the HDAC inhibitory effects. This bacterial strain, Megasphaera massiliensis MRx0029, was added to a model microbial consortium to assess its metabolic activity in interaction with a complex community. M. massiliensis MRx0029 successfully established in the consortium and enhanced the total and specific HDAC inhibitory function by increasing the capacity of the community to produce butyrate and valeric acid. We here show that single bacterial strains from the human gut microbiota have potential as novel HDI therapeutics for disease areas involving host epigenetic aberrations."
https://openalex.org/W2883820807,"The benefits of being well fed In eusocial insects, the vast majority of individuals sacrifice their reproductive potential to support the reproductive queen. Although this system has evolved repeatedly, there is still much debate surrounding its origin. Working with seven different species of ants, Chandra et al. used a transcriptomic approach to show that a single gene is consistently up-regulated in queens. This gene seems to confer reproductive status through integration with increased nutrition. In a clonal ant, larval signals disrupt this gene up-regulation, destabilizing the division of reproductive labor. Increasing levels of the associated peptide override these larval signals and establish eusociality. Science , this issue p. 398"
https://openalex.org/W2883358227,"Silicon smooths the way to vinyl cations Saturated carbon centers often undergo substitution reactions by initial cleavage of a carbon-halogen or carbon-oxygen bond, which leaves the carbon positively charged. Analogous cations have proven much harder to access from vinylic carbons that are engaged in double bonds. Popov et al. now show that silicon cations paired with noncoordinating anions can pull triflate groups off such vinylic carbons under ambient conditions (see the Perspective by Kennedy and Klumpp). The resultant vinyl cations react with simple alkanes through C–H insertion. Theoretical and mechanistic studies suggest that these reactions proceed through nonclassical pathways that bifurcate after the transition state. Science , this issue p. 381 ; see also p. 331"
https://openalex.org/W2884613836,"Histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) mediates heterochromatic gene silencing and is important for genome stability and the regulation of gene expression1–4. The establishment and epigenetic maintenance of heterochromatin involve the recruitment of H3K9 methyltransferases to specific sites on DNA, followed by the recognition of pre-existing H3K9me by the methyltransferase and methylation of proximal histone H35–11. This positive feedback loop must be tightly regulated to prevent deleterious epigenetic gene silencing. Extrinsic anti-silencing mechanisms involving histone demethylation or boundary elements help to limit the spread of inappropriate H3K9me12–15. However, how H3K9 methyltransferase activity is locally restricted or prevented from initiating random H3K9me—which would lead to aberrant gene silencing and epigenetic instability—is not fully understood. Here we reveal an autoinhibited conformation in the conserved H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 (also known as Suv39h) of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe that has a critical role in preventing aberrant heterochromatin formation. Biochemical and X-ray crystallographic data show that an internal loop in Clr4 inhibits the catalytic activity of this enzyme by blocking the histone H3K9 substrate-binding pocket, and that automethylation of specific lysines in this loop promotes a conformational switch that enhances the H3K9me activity of Clr4. Mutations that are predicted to disrupt this regulation lead to aberrant H3K9me, loss of heterochromatin domains and inhibition of growth, demonstrating the importance of the intrinsic inhibition and auto-activation of Clr4 in regulating the deposition of H3K9me and in preventing epigenetic instability. Conservation of the Clr4 autoregulatory loop in other H3K9 methyltransferases and the automethylation of a corresponding lysine in the human SUV39H2 homologue16 suggest that the mechanism described here is broadly conserved. An autoinhibitory conformation of the histone H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe helps to prevent aberrant heterochromatin formation and maintains epigenetic stability."

https://openalex.org/W2884885544,"This work investigates the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) response of 50-nm thick nano-laminated gold film using Kretschmann-based biosensing for detection of urea and creatinine in solution of various concentrations (non-enzymatic samples). Comparison was made with the presence of urease and creatininase enzymes in the urea and creatinine solutions (enzymatic samples), respectively. Angular interrogation technique was applied using optical wavelengths of 670 nm and 785 nm. The biosensor detects the presence of urea and creatinine at concentrations ranging from 50–800 mM for urea samples and 10–200 mM for creatinine samples. The purpose of studying the enzymatic sample was mainly to enhance the sensitivity of the sensor towards urea and creatinine in the samples. Upon exposure to 670 nm optical wavelength, the sensitivity of 1.4°/M was detected in non-enzymatic urea samples and 4°/M in non-enzymatic creatinine samples. On the other hand, sensor sensitivity as high as 16.2°/M in urea-urease samples and 10°/M in creatinine-creatininase samples was detected. The enhanced sensitivity possibly attributed to the increase in refractive index of analyte sensing layer due to urea-urease and creatinine-creatininase coupling activity. This work has successfully proved the design and demonstrated a proof-of-concept experiment using a low-cost and easy fabrication of Kretschmann based nano-laminated gold film SPR biosensor for detection of urea and creatinine using urease and creatininase enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2883292720,"Inflammation promotes gut polyposis Peutz–Jeghers Syndrome (PJS) causes benign polyps in the gut and a higher risk of several cancers caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor gene STK11 , which encodes liver kinase B1 (LKB1). LKB1's role in this disease is thought to be related to its tumor suppressor function. Now, Poffenberger et al. show that the T cell–specific heterozygous deletion of Stk11 is sufficient to reproduce PJS symptoms in mice (see the Perspective by Hollstein and Shaw). Polyps in mice and humans are characterized by immune cell infiltration, enhanced STAT3 signaling, and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). Targeting STAT3 signaling, IL-6, or T cells ameliorated the polyps, suggesting potential therapies for this disease. Science , this issue p. 406 ; see also p. 332"

Pig feces, pig oral secretions, bioaerosols, and worker nasal wash samples were collected and analyzed via rPCR and rRT-PCR for respiratory and diarrheal viruses.In all, 55 pig fecal, 49 pig oral or water, 45 bioaerosol, and 78 worker nasal wash samples were collected across 16 sites. PCV2 was detected in 21 pig fecal, 43 pig oral or water, 3 bioaerosol, and 4 worker nasal wash samples. In addition, one or more bioaerosol or pig samples were positive for EV, IAV, and RVC, and one or more worker samples were positive for ADV, CoV, IBV, and IDV.This study demonstrates that nucleic acids from a number of targeted viruses were present in pig oral secretions and pig fecal samples, and that several viruses were detected in bioaerosol samples or in the nasal passages of humans with occupational exposure to pigs. These results demonstrate the need for future research in strengthening viral surveillance at the human-animal interface, specifically through expanded bioaerosol sampling efforts and a seroepidemiological study of individuals with exposure to pigs in this region for PCV2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2884791432,"Chronic heart failure (CHF) is characterized by an ongoing nonresolving inflammatory status, where T lymphocytes seem critical. It has been recently recognized that transition from acute to chronic inflammation could be caused by defects in resolving inflammation, the resolution of which is mediated by a novel family of ω-3-derived specialized proresolving lipid mediators such as resolvins. We analyzed 27 elderly patients with CHF and 23 healthy age-matched control subjects, and we reported significantly lower levels of D-series resolvin (RvD)l in plasma of patients with CHF that were associated with a reduced ability of their leukocytes to produce this lipid via its biosynthetic enzyme 15-lipoxygenase and that correlated with gas exchange dysfunction. Furthermore, when pretreating ex vivo peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with CHF with RvD1 or RvD2, we found that neither of them was able to modulate the immune response of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in terms of proinflammatory cytokine production, namely TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-2. Such impaired T-cell responsiveness in patients with CHF was associated with a significant reduction in mRNA and protein expression of RvD1 receptor GPR32, suggesting a defective signaling in the proresolving pathway. We conclude that patients with CHF show alterations in producing proresolving mediator RvD1 and a failure of adaptive immune cells in responding to the anti-inflammatory actions of RvDs that may contribute to the progression of chronic inflammation. Thus, the proresolution pathway might be a potential candidate to design better treatments for CHF aimed at reducing T cell-mediated chronic inflammation.—Chiurchiù, V., Leuti, A., Saracini, S., Fontana, D., Finamore, P., Giua, R., Padovini, L., Incalzi, R.

Then the amoeba cells clump together into a “slug” and initiate a complex multicellular reproductive phase. Specialized cells within aggregates rid the slug of any extracellular bacteria. However, some strains of amoeba tolerate live, intracellular bacteria. Dinh et al. discovered that these carrier strains bear surface lectins that bind Klebsiella bacteria, promote cell entry, and prevent the bacteria from being immediately digested. These bacteria then provide a future food source. Moreover, the internalized bacteria transfer DNA into the amoeba nucleus, resulting in transient genetic transformation. Science , this issue p. 402"
https://openalex.org/W2883423724,"Data assimilation is an important discipline in geosciences that aims to combine the information contents from both prior geophysical models and observational data (observations) to obtain improved model estimates. Ensemble-based methods are among the state-of-the-art assimilation algorithms in the data assimilation community. When applying ensemble-based methods to assimilate big geophysical data, substantial computational resources are needed in order to compute and/or store certain quantities (e.g., the Kalman-gain-type matrix), given both big model and data sizes. In addition, uncertainty quantification of observational data, e.g., in terms of estimating the observation error covariance matrix, also becomes computationally challenging, if not infeasible. To tackle the aforementioned challenges in the presence of big data, in a previous study, the authors proposed a wavelet-based sparse representation procedure for 2D seismic data assimilation problems (also known as history matching problems in petroleum engineering). In the current study, we extend the sparse representation procedure to 3D problems, as this is an important step towards real field case studies. To demonstrate the efficiency of the extended sparse representation procedure, we apply an ensemble-based seismic history matching framework with the extended sparse representation procedure to a 3D benchmark case, the Brugge field. In this benchmark case study, the total number of seismic data is in the order of [Formula: see text]. We show that the wavelet-based sparse representation procedure is extremely efficient in reducing the size of seismic data, while preserving the salient features of seismic data. Moreover, even with a substantial data-size reduction through sparse representation, the ensemble-based seismic history matching framework can still achieve good estimation accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2883839056,"Mutations in eyes shut homolog (EYS), a gene predominantly expressed in the photoreceptor cells of the retina, are among the most frequent causes of autosomal recessive (ar) retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a progressive retinal disorder. Due to the absence of EYS in several rodent species and its retina-specific expression, still little is known about the exact function of EYS and the pathogenic mechanism underlying EYS-associated RP. We characterized eys in zebrafish, by RT-PCR analysis on zebrafish eye-derived RNA, which led to the identification of a 8,715 nucleotide coding sequence that is divided over 46 exons. The transcript is predicted to encode a 2,905-aa protein that contains 39 EGF-like domains and five laminin A G-like domains, which overall shows 33% identity with human EYS. To study the function of EYS, we generated a stable eysrmc101/rmc101 mutant zebrafish model using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The introduced lesion is predicted to result in premature termination of protein synthesis and lead to loss of Eys function. Immunohistochemistry on retinal sections revealed that Eys localizes at the region of the connecting cilium and that both rhodopsin and cone transducin are mislocalized in the absence of Eys. Electroretinogram recordings showed diminished b-wave amplitudes in eysrmc101/rmc101 zebrafish (5 dpf) compared to age- and strain-matched wild-type larvae. In addition, decreased locomotor activity in response to light stimuli was observed in eys mutant larvae. Altogether, our study shows that absence of Eys leads to a disorganized retinal architecture and causes visual dysfunction in zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W2883109619,"Pressure overload of the heart leads to cardiac remodeling that may progress into heart failure, a common, morbid and mortal condition. Increased mechanistic insight into remodeling is instrumental for development of novel heart failure treatment. Cardiac remodeling comprises cardiomyocyte hypertrophic growth, extracellular matrix alterations including fibrosis, and inflammation. Fibromodulin is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan that regulates collagen fibrillogenesis. Fibromodulin is expressed in the cardiac extracellular matrix, however its role in the heart remains largely unknown. We investigated fibromodulin levels in myocardial biopsies from heart failure patients and mice, subjected fibromodulin knock-out (FMOD-KO) mice to pressure overload by aortic banding, and overexpressed fibromodulin in cultured cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts using adenovirus. Fibromodulin was 3-10-fold upregulated in hearts of heart failure patients and mice. Both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts expressed fibromodulin, and its expression was increased by pro-inflammatory stimuli. Without stress, FMOD-KO mice showed no cardiac phenotype. Upon aortic banding, left ventricles of FMOD-KO mice developed mildly exacerbated hypertrophic remodeling compared to wild-type mice, with increased cardiomyocyte size and altered infiltration of leukocytes. There were no differences in mortality, left ventricle dilatation, dysfunction or expression of heart failure markers. Although collagen amount and cross-linking were comparable in FMOD-KO and wild-type, overexpression of fibromodulin in cardiac fibroblasts in vitro decreased their migratory capacity and expression of fibrosis-associated molecules, i.e. the collagen-cross linking enzyme lysyl oxidase, transglutaminase 2 and periostin. In conclusion, despite a robust fibromodulin upregulation in clinical and experimental heart failure, FMOD-KO mice showed a relatively mild hypertrophic phenotype. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, fibromodulin has anti-fibrotic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2883998243,"Background Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) is a common syndrome in men. NGU may have several causes, but many cases are caused by sexually transmitted infections that may also cause complications in their female partners. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium are the most common causes of NGU, but in up to 35% of the cases, none of the known viral or bacterial causes are found. Traditionally, pathogens have been detected using various culture techniques that may not identify all species present in the urethra. To address this, we used culture-independent methods for analysis of the male urethral microbiota. Methods This case-control study analysed first void urine samples, collected at STD clinics in Stockholm, Sweden from men with idiopathic urethritis (IU), i.e. negative for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Trichomonas vaginalis, adenovirus, and herpes simplex virus type 1 and -2 together with samples from men without urethritis. Forty-six controls and 39 idiopathic urethritis patients were analysed. Results The microbiota was highly diverse: None of the 302 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in negative controls and IU patients were found in all of the samples or even in all of the samples in one group. More than 50% of the OTUs were only found in one or two of the total of 85 samples. Still the most dominant 1/6 of the genera constituted 79% of the sequences. Hierarchical clustering in a heatmap showed no specific clustering of patients or controls. A number of IU patient samples were dominated by a single genus previously related to urethritis (Gardnerella, Haemophilus, Ureaplasma). Conclusion The male urethra contain a very diverse composition of bacteria, even in healthy controls. NGU may be caused by a number of different bacteria but more studies including a higher number of samples are needed for elucidation of the role of each species."

This study evaluates the molecular changes in HCA and HCC and in comparison to their adjacent non-neoplastic liver. Methods 11 patients with HCA and 10 patients with HCC without underlying hepatitis or cirrhosis were included in this pilot study. Tumor and non-tumor liver tissues were selected for immunohistochemical staining, small RNA sequencing, and targeted gene sequencing. We compared microRNA expressions and mutations between HCA and HCC and non-neoplastic liver. Results HCA were classified as inflammatory (n = 6), steatotic (n = 4), or β-catenin activated (n = 1) subtypes. MicroRNA profile of all 3 HCA subtypes clustered between that of normal liver and HCC in principal component analysis. In both HCA and HCC, miR-200a, miR-429, and miR-490-3p were significantly downregulated compared to normal liver, whereas miR-452, miR-766, and miR-1180 were significantly upregulated. In addition, compared to HCA, HCC had significantly higher expression of members of the chromosome 19 miRNA cluster (C19MC), including miR-515-5p, miR-517a, miR-518b, and miR-520c-3p. Conclusions This study indicates that while there are significant differences in the molecular profile between HCA and HCC, several miRNAs are similarly deregulated in HCA and HCC compared to adjacent normal liver. These results may provide insights into the drivers of hepatocarcinogenesis and warrant further investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2883692867,"The expression of Sialyl-Tn (STn) in tumors is associated with metastatic disease, poor prognosis, and reduced overall survival. STn is expressed on ovarian cancer biomarkers including CA-125 (MUC16) and MUC1, and elevated serum levels of STn in ovarian cancer patients correlate with lower five-year survival rates. In the current study, we humanized novel anti-STn antibodies and demonstrated the retention of nanomolar (nM) target affinity while maintaining STn antigen selectivity. STn antibodies conjugated to Monomethyl Auristatin E (MMAE-ADCs) demonstrated in vitro cytotoxicity specific to STn-expressing ovarian cancer cell lines and tumor growth inhibition in vivo with both ovarian cancer cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models. We further validated the clinical potential of these STn-ADCs through tissue cross-reactivity and cynomolgus monkey toxicity studies. No membrane staining for STn was present in any organs of human or cynomolgus monkey origin, and the toxicity profile was favorable and only revealed MMAE-class associated events with none being attributed to the targeting of STn. The up-regulation of STn in ovarian carcinoma in combination with high affinity and STn-specific selectivity of the mAbs presented herein warrant further investigation for anti-STn antibody-drug conjugates in the clinical setting."

MUM-2B cells cultured in three-dimensional Matrigel were treated with varying concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 μmol/L) of apatinib to test its effect on VM in vitro, followed by MTT proliferation and transwell invasion assays to determine the effect of apatinib on cell proliferation and invasion of MUM-2B cells. In vivo, we used a melanoma cancer model to test the effect of short-term apatinib (100, 200, 300 mg/kg) treatment on VM. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry staining, and CD31-PAS dual staining were performed to assess the expression of VEGFR-2, ERK-1/2, PI3K, and MMP-2, and formation of VM. The results showed apatinib-treated groups formed a lesser number of VM in 3D matrigel, while the cell viability in MTT proliferation assay and the number of migration cells in transwell invasion assay were significantly lower in apatinib-treated groups. In addition, short-term apatinib treatment inhibited angiogenesis, VM formation, and tumor growth in models of melanoma cancer. Mice in apatinib-treated groups showed a markedly reduced expression of VEGFR-2, ERK-1/2, PI3K, and MMP-2. In summary, apatinib could inhibit the expression of VEGFR-2, and downregulate the ERK1/2/PI3K/MMP-2 signaling cascade, which may be one of the underlying mechanisms by which apatinib inhibits angiogenesis and the development of VM in models of melanoma cancer, and restrains the formation of VM by MUM-2B cells. Apatinib shows inhibitory effects on cell proliferation and invasion of MUM-2B cells, which is a close relationship with the VM."

They then cleave nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) transcription factor subunits, dampening activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and thereby suppressing host immune responses. We demonstrate here that GtgA, GogA, and PipA cleave a subset of NF-κB subunits, including p65, RelB, and cRel but not NF-κB1 and NF-κB2, whereas the functionally similar type III secretion system effector NleC of enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli cleaved all five NF-κB subunits. Mutational analysis of NF-κB subunits revealed that a single nonconserved residue in NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 that corresponds to the P1′ residue Arg-41 in p65 prevents cleavage of these subunits by GtgA, GogA, and PipA, explaining the observed substrate specificity of these enzymes. Crystal structures of GtgA in its apo-form and in complex with the p65 N-terminal domain explained the importance of the P1′ residue. Furthermore, the pattern of interactions suggested that GtgA recognizes NF-κB subunits by mimicking the shape and negative charge of the DNA phosphate backbone. Moreover, structure-based mutational analysis of GtgA uncovered amino acids that are required for the interaction of GtgA with p65, as well as those that are required for full activity of GtgA in suppressing NF-κB activation.

Mutational analysis of NF-κB subunits revealed that a single nonconserved residue in NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 that corresponds to the P1′ residue Arg-41 in p65 prevents cleavage of these subunits by GtgA, GogA, and PipA, explaining the observed substrate specificity of these enzymes. Crystal structures of GtgA in its apo-form and in complex with the p65 N-terminal domain explained the importance of the P1′ residue. Furthermore, the pattern of interactions suggested that GtgA recognizes NF-κB subunits by mimicking the shape and negative charge of the DNA phosphate backbone. Moreover, structure-based mutational analysis of GtgA uncovered amino acids that are required for the interaction of GtgA with p65, as well as those that are required for full activity of GtgA in suppressing NF-κB activation. This study therefore provides detailed and critical insight into the mechanism of substrate recognition by this family of proteins important for bacterial virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2884416988,"Despite occupying a central geographic position, investigations of hominin populations in the Arabian Peninsula during the Lower Palaeolithic period are rare. The colonization of Eurasia below 55 degrees latitude indicates the success of the genus Homo in the Early and Middle Pleistocene, but the extent to which these hominins were capable of innovative and novel behavioural adaptations to engage with mid-latitude environments is unclear. Here we describe new field investigations at the Saffaqah locality (206–76) near Dawadmi, in central Arabia that aim to establish how hominins adapted to this region. The site is located in the interior of Arabia over 500 km from both the Red Sea and the Gulf, and at the headwaters of two major extinct river systems that were likely used by Acheulean hominins to cross the Peninsula. Saffaqah is one of the largest Acheulean sites in Arabia with nearly a million artefacts estimated to occur on the surface, and it is also the first to yield stratified deposits containing abundant artefacts. It is situated in the unusual setting of a dense and well-preserved landscape of Acheulean localities, with sites and isolated artefacts occurring regularly for tens of kilometres in every direction. We describe both previous and recent excavations at Saffaqah and its large lithic assemblage. We analyse thousands of artefacts from excavated and surface contexts, including giant andesite cores and flakes, smaller cores and retouched artefacts, as well as handaxes and cleavers. Technological assessment of stratified lithics and those from systematic survey, enable the reconstruction of stone tool life histories. The Acheulean hominins at Dawadmi were strong and skilful, with their adaptation evidently successful for some time. However, these biface-makers were also technologically conservative, and used least-effort strategies of resource procurement and tool transport. Ultimately, central Arabia was depopulated, likely in the face of environmental deterioration in the form of increasing aridity."

Their formation is considered the main virulence mechanism enabling the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis to cause devastating nosocomial, implant-associated infections. Biofilms often contain proteins, and an 18-kDa protein called small basic protein (Sbp) recently was discovered in the S. epidermidis biofilm matrix and may serve as a scaffolding protein in both polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA)-dependent and accumulation-associated protein (Aap)-dependent biofilm formations. In Aap-mediated biofilm formation, Sbp colocalizes with Domain-B of Aap, implying that Sbp directly interacts with Aap's Domain-B. However, the structure of Sbp and its interaction with Aap, as well as the molecular mechanism underlying Sbp's roles in biofilm formation, are incompletely understood. In this work, we used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), NMR, analytical size-exclusion chromatography, and isothermal titration calorimetry analyses to determine the Sbp structure and characterize its interaction with Aap's Domain-B. We found that Sbp is monomeric and partially folded in solution, and, unexpectedly, we observed no direct interactions between Sbp and Aap Domain-B. Instead, we noted that Sbp forms amyloid fibrils both in vitro and in vivo. Atomic force, transmission electron, and confocal fluorescence microscopy methods confirmed the formation of Sbp amyloid fibrils and revealed their morphology.

https://openalex.org/W2883216722,"Aging of white adipose tissue (WAT) is associated with reduced insulin sensitivity, which contributes to whole-body glucose intolerance. WAT aging in mice impairs cold-induced beige adipocyte recruitment (beiging), which has been attributed to the senescence of adipose progenitor cells. Tumor suppressor p53 has also been implicated in WAT aging. However, whether p53-related cellular aging in mature white adipocytes is causative of age-impaired WAT beiging remains unknown. It is also unclear whether transient p53 inhibition can rescue WAT beiging. Herein, we report that p53 increased in adipose tissues of 28-wk-old (aged) mice with impaired beiging capability. Cold exposure decreased p53 in beiging WAT of young mice but not in aged mice. In aged mice, inducible p53 ablation in differentiated adipocytes restored cold-induced WAT beiging and augmented whole-body energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity. Transient pharmacological inhibition of p53 led to the same beneficial effects. Mechanistically, cold exposure repressed autophagy in beiging WAT of young mice yet increased autophagy in aged WAT. p53-ablation reduced microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-mediated mitochondria clearance (mitophagy) and hence facilitated the increase of mitochondria during beiging. These findings suggest that p53-induced mitophagy in aged white adipocytes impedes WAT beiging and may be therapeutically targeted to improve insulin sensitivity in aged WAT.—Fu, W., Liu, Y., Sun, C., Yin, H.

https://openalex.org/W2883708456,"Spaceflights are known to affect the immune system. In a previous study, we demonstrated that hypergravity exposure during murine development modified 85% of the T-cell receptor (TCR)-β repertoire. In this study, we investigated whether socioenvironmental stressors encountered during space missions affect T lymphopoiesis and the TCR-β repertoire. To address this question, pregnant mice were subjected throughout gestation to chronic unpredictable mild stressors (CUMS), a model used to mimic socioenvironmental stresses encountered during space missions. Then, newborn T lymphopoiesis and the TCR-β repertoire were studied by flow cytometry and high-throughput sequencing, respectively. No change in thymocyte maturation or TCR expression were noted. TCR-β repertoire analysis revealed that 75% of neonate TCR-β sequences resulted from the expression of 3 variable (V)β segments and that this core repertoire was not affected by CUMS. However, the minor repertoire, representing 25% of the global repertoire, was sensitive to CUMS exposure. We also showed that the variable (diversity) joining [V(D)J] recombination process was unlikely to be affected. Finally, we noted that the CUMS neonatal minor repertoire was more self-reactive than the one of control pups. These findings show that socioenvironmental stressors such as those encountered during space missions affect a fraction (25%) of the TCR-β repertoire and that these stressors could increase self-reactivity.-Fonte, C., Kaminski, S., Vanet, A., Lanfumey, L., Cohen-Salmon, C., Ghislin, S., Frippiat, J.-P.

https://openalex.org/W2884662629,"L-Asparaginase is an enzyme successfully being used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. However, some disadvantages still limit its full application potential, e.g., allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and blood clotting impairment. Therefore, much effort has been directed at improving its performance. A popular strategy is to randomly conjugate L-asparaginase with mono-methoxy polyethylene glycol, which became a commercial FDA approved formulation widely used in recent years. To improve this formulation by PEGylation, herein we performed cysteine-directed conjugation of the L-asparaginase subunits to prevent dissociation-induced loss of activity. The recombinant cysteine conjugation sites were introduced by mutagenesis at surface-exposed positions on the protein to avoid affecting the catalytic activity. Three conjugates were obtained using different linear PEGs of 1000, 2000, and 5000 g/mol, with physical properties ranging from a semi-solid gel to a fully soluble state. The soluble-conjugate exhibited higher catalytic activity than the non-conjugated mutant, and the same activity than the native enzyme. The cysteine-directed crosslinking of the L-asparaginase subunits produced a higher molecular weight conjugate compared to the native tetrameric enzyme. This strategy might improve L-asparaginase efficiency for leukemia treatment by reducing glomerular filtration due to the increase in hydrodynamic size thus extending half-live, while at the same time retaining full catalytic activity."

Here, we investigated the mechanisms of Notch-induced injury in renal epithelial cells. We performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis to identify Notch target genes using an in vitro system of cultured tubular epithelial cells expressing the intracellular domain of Notch1. One of the top downregulated genes was Disabled-2 ( Dab2). With the use of Drosophila nephrocytes as a model system, we found that Dab (the Drosophila homolog of Dab2) knockdown resulted in a significant filtration defect, indicating that loss of Dab2 plays a functional role in kidney disease development. We showed that Dab2 expression in cultured tubular epithelial cells is involved in endocytic regulation and that it also protects cells from TGF-β-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In vivo correlation studies indicated its additional role in renal ischemia-induced injury. Together, these data suggest that Dab2 plays a versatile role in the kidney and may impact on acute and CKDs.-Schütte-Nütgen, K., Edeling, M., Mendl, G., Krahn, M.

A2E and all-trans-retinal dimer (atRAL-dimer) are two well characterized bisretinoid constituents of RPE lipofuscin. In this study, we found that, after treatment of primary porcine RPE (pRPE) cells with atRAL, atRAL-dimer readily formed and accumulated in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, but A2E was barely detected. Cell-based assays revealed that atRAL, the precursor of atRAL-dimer, significantly altered the morphology of primary pRPE cells and decreased cell viability at a concentration of 80 μm regardless of light exposure. By contrast, atRAL-dimer was not cytotoxic and phototoxic to primary pRPE cells. Compared with atRAL and A2E, atRAL-dimer was more vulnerable to light, followed by the generation of its photocleaved products. Moreover, we observed the presence of atRAL-dimer in reaction mixtures of atRAL with porcine rod outer segments (ROS), RPE/choroid, or neural retina. Taken together, we here proposed an alternative metabolic/antidotal pathway of atRAL in the retina: atRAL that evades participation of the visual (retinoid) cycle undergoes a condensation reaction to yield atRAL-dimer in both ROS and RPE. Translocation of atRAL, all-trans N-retinylidene–phosphatidylethanolamine (NR-PE), atRAL-dimer, and photocleavage products of atRAL-dimer from ROS into RPE is accomplished by phagocytosing shed ROS on a daily basis. Without causing damage to RPE cells, light breaks up total atRAL-dimer within RPE cells to release low-molecular-weight photocleavage fragments.

To achieve high accuracy and computational efficiency of segmentation relies on a custom subset of atlases for each target subject. However, the criterion for atlas pre-selection remains an open question. In this study, two atlas pre-selection approaches based on location-based feature matching were proposed and compared to random and mutual information-based methods using a database of 47 atlases. A varying number of atlases ranked top with hierarchical structural granularity were compared using Dice overlap. The results indicated that the proposed 4L approach consistently led to the highest level of accuracy at a given number of employed atlases in both adult and geriatric populations. In addition, the proposed two methods (4L and LV) can reduce 20 times computational time compared with the stereotypical mutual information-based method. Our pre-selection strategy would provide better segmentation performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The proposed atlas pre-selection will be further implemented into our online automatic brain image segmentation system (www.mricloud.org)."

Minimally invasive kyphoplasty is a common procedure used for symptomatic amelioration. However, it fails in treating the underlying etiologies of VCFs. Use of systemic therapy is limited due to low perfusion to the spinal column and systemic toxicity. Localized delivery of drugs to the vertebral column can provide a promising alternative approach. A porcine kyphoplasty model was developed to study the magnetically guided drug delivery of systemically injected magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Jamshidi cannulated pedicle needles were placed into the thoracic vertebra and, following inflatable bone tamp expansion, magnetic bone cement was injected to the vertebral body. Histological analysis was performed after intravenous injection of MNPs. Qualitative analysis of harvested tissues revealed successful placement of magnetic cement into the vertebral body. Further quantitative analysis of histological sections of several vertebral bodies demonstrated enhanced accumulation of MNPs to regions that had magnetic cement injected during kyphoplasty compared to those that did not. By modifying the kyphoplasty bone cement to include magnets, thereby providing a guidance stimulus and a localizer, we were successfully able to guide intravenously injected magnetic nanoparticles to the thoracic vertebra. These results demonstrate an in-vivo proof of concept of a novel drug delivery strategy that has the potential to treat the underlying causes of VCFs, in addition to providing symptomatic support."

Sympathy is a specific form of empathy and involves both cognitive and affective empathy. Data are presented from a new task of self-reported sympathy and personal distress. Methods Participants with autism (93 males; 161 females) and controls (40 males, 93 females) took part in an online survey via the Autism Research Centre or Cambridge Psychology websites. Participants completed a task where they were asked to rate photographic images that were either of distressing, neutral or happy scenes, according to the amount of sympathy they had for the individual in the photo and the degree of personal distress they felt. All participants also completed the Empathy Quotient (EQ). Results Significant differences were found between the autism and control groups for both self-reported sympathy and personal distress, with participants with autism giving lower ratings than controls. Control females scored significantly higher than control males in both sympathy and distress. Sympathy and distress ratings in the autism group did not differ significantly by sex. EQ showed positive correlations with sympathy and distress scores. Conclusions Using a new measure of self-reported sympathy, we found that both males and females with autism gave lower ratings of sympathy when viewing people in distressing scenarios, compared to controls."
https://openalex.org/W2884251079,"Introduction Swimming events in city canals are gaining popularity in the Netherlands, even though canal water is usually not officially designated for recreational use. Knowledge regarding the risk of infection after swimming in canals is limited. An outbreak was reported in 2015 following a canal swimming event in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Local governments were concerned about the health risks of such events. In order to assess the safety of canal swimming, the Public Health Service (PHS) prospectively investigated two city canal swimming events in 2015. In 2016, we repeated this study, aiming to prospectively determine the risks of infection during two urban swimming events, the Utrecht SingelSwim 2016 (USS) and the Amsterdam City Swim 2016 (ACS). Methods We sent online questionnaires to 271 USS participants and 2697 ACS participants, concerning personal characteristics, symptoms, and exposure. Participants were asked to forward the questionnaire to three relatives, i.e., non-exposed. We analyzed water samples from the USS venue taken during the event, as well as stool samples of USS participants with acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI). AGI was defined as diarrhea and/or vomiting within seven days after the event. We calculated adjusted risk ratios (RR) for AGI in the exposed group compared with non-exposed respondents, using binomial regression models. Results The questionnaire was returned by 160 USS participants (exposed) (59%) and 40 non-exposed relatives. Five percent of the exposed (n = 17) and 3% of non-exposed (n = 1) reported AGI (RR = 1.69; 95% CI: 0.23–12.46). Norovirus genogroup II was detected in two of six USS water samples and in none of the three stool samples. In one of three stool samples, rotavirus was detected. The questionnaire was returned by 1169 ACS participants (exposed) (43%) and 410 non-exposed relatives. Six percent of the exposed (n = 71) and 1% of non-exposed (n = 5) reported AGI (RR 4.86; 95% CI: 1.98–11.97). Conclusion Results of the ACS event showed a higher risk for AGI among the exposed, indicating that participants of events in urban canals in the Netherlands could be at a higher risk for AGI than those not participating. The inconclusive results from the USS are likely due to the small sample size. Swimming in non-monitored open water can bring health risks and more knowledge about environmental and human risk factors helps reduce the risk by being able to more specifically advise organizations and governments."

We stimulated monocyte-derived DCs with Alternaria alternate and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To determine the anti-inflammatory effects, we pre-treated DCs with various concentrations of microencapsulated C. obtusa essential oil and collected the supernatants to measure interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and we determined the expression of cell surface molecules. The effects of the essential oil on CD4+ T cells polarization was determine by culturing stimulated DCs and autologous CD4+ T cells. Alternaria enhanced the production of IL-6 and TNF-α from DCs, and pretreating DCs with 0.001, 0.01, and 0.05% of the essential oil significantly inhibited their production. Increased CD80 and CD86 expression by Alternaria was significantly inhibited with 0.05% of the essential oil. Alternaria-induced IL-5, IL-10, and interferon-gamma from CD4+ T cells were significantly inhibited with C. obtusa essential oil in a dose dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W2883485333,"Purpose Human females have a unique duration of post-reproductive longevity, during which sex-specific mechanisms ma influence later-life mechanisms of neuronal resilience and vulnerability. The maintenance of energy metabolism, through the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) apparatus, is essential for brain health. Given the known association between reproductive period (years from menarche to menopause) and cognitive aging, we examined the hypothesis that cumulative estrogen exposure across the lifetime may be associated with differential methylation of genes in the OXPHOS pathway. Methods Using DNA methylation patterns in the post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 426 women prospectively followed until death in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, we examined the relationship between reproductive period (subtracting age at menarche from age at menopause) and DNA methylation of a published set of autosomal OXPHOS genes previously implicated in stroke susceptibility. We then performed an unsupervised analysis of methylation levels across the Hallmark pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database. Results We observed a strong association between reproductive period and DNA methylation status across OXPHOS CpGs. We replicated this association between reproductive period and DNA methylation in a much larger set of OXPHOS genes in our unsupervised analysis. Here, reproductive period also showed associations with methylation in genes related to E2F, MYC and MTORC1 signaling, fatty acid metabolism and DNA repair. Conclusion This study provides evidence from both a supervised and unsupervised analyses, that lifetime cumulative endogenous steroid exposures may play a role in maintenance of post-menopausal cellular balance, including in brain tissue."

For topographical comparison, a similar experimental protocol was applied for the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI) of the hand.The calculated centers of gravity (COGs) of both muscles were located on the precentral gyrus with the PAM COGs located more laterally compared to the FDI. The distance between the mean PAM and mean FDI COG was 26.3 mm. The TMS mapping results were confirmed by fMRI, which showed a dominance of cortical activation within the precentral gyrus during the corresponding motor tasks. The correspondence of TMS and fMRI results was high.The involvement of the primary motor cortex in PAM activation might point to an evolved function of the auricular muscles in humans and/or the ability of intentional (and selective) muscle activation."

Not long ago, I wouldn't have done anything about it. Growing up, I had been taught that the way to success was to put my head down and work hard. If my work was good enough, it would speak for itself and I would be rewarded. This, coupled with a natural shyness, meant that I rarely worked up the nerve to put myself forward.

Then last year happened. My long-term relationship was in shambles. I was in the midst of a significant health scare and battling doubts about where my career was headed. When the dust settled, I decided that I needed to take control of my life again—by becoming my own biggest advocate.

So, with my heart pounding, I asked my colleague to ask the panel organizers to include me. My mind flooded with a litany of well-practiced self-doubt. Maybe I didn't deserve it. Maybe I was being too ambitious. But my colleague immediately contacted the organizers, who quickly agreed to add me to the panel.

I've come to understand that I can't be recognized or rewarded for my work if I'm invisible. This isn't a revolutionary idea, I know, but as an introvert this is my personal Everest. The biggest lesson I've learned is simply to ask for what you want. Ask to be nominated for an award. Ask to give a guest lecture. Ask for a reference letter from that person you think is beyond your reach. The worst that can happen is that the answer is no, but I've found that people are generally happy to oblige.

I am also working to get more comfortable promoting my accomplishments. A couple of years ago, when a mentor agreed to write a recommendation letter for me but asked me to provide a draft as a starting point, I agonized over it. Writing nice things about myself felt completely unnatural. With every complimentary statement I committed to paper came mounting anxiety that my mentor would disapprove of my lack of humility. I never got any feedback about that letter, so I don't know for sure what my mentor thought of it. Nonetheless, I learned an important lesson: I can't control what other people think, so I might as well share my accomplishments as best I can. These days, whenever I ask for a recommendation letter, I offer to provide a draft. I know best how to highlight my skills and accomplishments for a particular application, and it doesn't hurt to offer.

I've also embraced social media as a way to share my accomplishments more widely. I was hesitant at first, worried that I might cross the line from self-promotion to bragging. But when I asked myself whether I was turned off by other scientists sharing their publications, awards, projects, and achievements, the answer was clear: nope. In fact, their self-promotion helped me discover amazing work and find new professional connections. Last year, for example, I was intrigued to see two young female scientists promoting their new podcast on Twitter. I commented on their post, suggesting science policy as an episode topic, and they ended up interviewing me on their show! This unique opportunity would never have materialized without a little online self-promotion on both our ends.

I think advocating for myself will always make me a little uncomfortable. But I do plenty of other uncomfortable things to ensure I'm living my best life, like getting flu shots and (ugh) going to the gym. I suppose I can do the same for my career.

Paul was deeply admired by his students, colleagues, and friends for his many talents. He was skilled in mechanics, science, diplomacy, administration, and athletics. Beyond his scientific success, culminating in a share of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Paul contributed to the community by serving as a role model, demonstrating the wisest path forward in tough situations.

Paul died at his home in Los Angeles, which he built, serving as his own general contractor. Recalling Paul's mechanical skills, his daughter Gail said that they had never had a repairman in the house. Earlier, while at the University of Minnesota, Paul and Lyda had designed their first home, for which Paul was the plumber, electrician, and cabinet maker. Paul was teaching his class at the university when the inspector arrived at their homesite to evaluate the plumbing. He lingered intently over each fitting and junction and then confronted Lyda with the question, “Who did this work?” Her heart fell as she told him it had been her husband. “He must have been trained in the old country,” said the inspector, “they don't do fine work like this anymore.”

In fact, Paul was raised in Provo, Utah, the fourth of seven children, a descendant of what he called “hardy Mormon pioneer stock.” Although he rejected the religious tenets of his church, he attributed his scientific career to parental and community devotion to education. He attended Brigham Young University, a few blocks from his home, graduating with a degree in chemistry in 1939. That autumn, he left for graduate school at the University of Wisconsin–Madison armed with $150 in cash, a $400-per-year scholarship, and his new bride, Lyda. He soon developed a second love—for biochemistry. After earning his Ph.D. in the subject in 1943, he did war research on blood proteins at Stanford University, joined the faculty at the University of Minnesota, where he introduced chemical and isotopic methods for the study of enzyme mechanisms, and then settled for good at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in 1963. Starting at age 70, Paul and Lyda enjoyed an active retirement of tennis, golf, bridge, and travel throughout the American West, interrupted only by the award of Paul's Nobel Prize at age 79.

Paul's most profound discovery was that adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of life, is synthesized in living cells by a rotary molecular engine, ATP synthase. The inference of this unprecedented mechanism from measurements of chemical rates could have been made only by a scientist with Paul's deep mechanical understanding. He applied mass spectrometry to monitor oxygen-18 exchange kinetics to understand the enzymatic mechanism of ATP synthase. His experiments suggested that the energy of oxidation is coupled to the release of ATP from the enzyme, rather than to ATP synthesis (his so-called “binding change mechanism”), and that the enzymatic reaction of ATP synthesis must involve more than one catalytic site. From these insights, he correctly proposed a rotary molecular engine, later gloriously illuminated by the crystal structure of ATP synthase by British chemist John E. Walker. For this work, he and Walker shared half of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1997.

Paul had the curiosity and confidence to grapple with big questions and big projects. Though he studied some 20 enzymes during the course of his career, he kept returning to ATP synthase. As he said in a biographical memoir, “Although the larger questions [about oxidative phosphorylation] were not likely to be answered, at least I wanted to try.” He knew that “effort is difficult without optimism, and accomplishment is rare without effort.”

Soon after moving from Minnesota to UCLA, Paul applied his optimism and effort to founding the Molecular Biology Institute (MBI). He immediately set out to recruit faculty (around 20 over time, including me) and students (some 400 have completed molecular biology Ph.D.s as of 2018). With phenomenal persistence, he put together a mosaic of funding sources for construction of the laboratory now known as Boyer Hall. However, not every project of Paul's came to fruition. In 1980, he envisioned a set of bicycle freeways emanating from UCLA that would change the character of Los Angeles. Clearly, that idea was before its time, but Paul could once again say “at least I wanted to try.”

Active in the national leadership of the biochemical community, Paul served as president of the society now called the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, as well as chair of the Division of Biological Chemistry of the American Chemical Society. With Lyda's assistance, he produced 18 volumes of the review series The Enzymes. 

Paul's many achievements were made possible by his optimism, effort, ambition, and know-how, but there was something more: character. In my every encounter with Paul, from the first in 1967 to my last shortly before his death 50 years later, I sensed his drive to get at the truth, his generous judgments of others and their work, and his modesty. Together, these traits made him the most effective leader that many of us have ever personally known. Under his 18-year directorship of the MBI, faculty meetings were amicable and short. Paul had discussed the issues beforehand with each of us and had forged a consensus prior to the meeting. A generous author, Paul carefully noted the advances made by each of his graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in his several scientific autobiographies. In appreciation of these contributions, Paul donated to UCLA part of his Nobel Prize stipend for awards to his current UCLA postdoctoral fellows. Paul also invariably took care to credit the results from the labs of other scientists. Even when he disagreed, the tone was one of respect, sometimes noting where in hindsight his own interpretation had been wrong.

In the present era, when science and reason are under attack, facts are considered optional, lying by leaders is not unexpected, and bullying and falsely hogging credit are tolerated, Paul Boyer's life stands as a model of the proper path for all of us who have had the privilege of knowing him.
