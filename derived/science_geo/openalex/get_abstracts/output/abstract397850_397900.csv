https://openalex.org/W2131215891,"Clinicopathological studies suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology begins ∼10-15 years before the resulting cognitive impairment draws medical attention. Biomarkers that can detect AD pathology in its early stages and predict dementia onset would, therefore, be invaluable for patient care and efficient clinical trial design. We utilized a targeted proteomics approach to discover novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers that can augment the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of current leading CSF biomarkers (Aβ42, tau, p-tau181).Using a multiplexed Luminex platform, 190 analytes were measured in 333 CSF samples from cognitively normal (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] 0), very mildly demented (CDR 0.5), and mildly demented (CDR 1) individuals. Mean levels of 37 analytes (12 after Bonferroni correction) were found to differ between CDR 0 and CDR>0 groups. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses revealed that small combinations of a subset of these markers (cystatin C, VEGF, TRAIL-R3, PAI-1, PP, NT-proBNP, MMP-10, MIF, GRO-α, fibrinogen, FAS, eotaxin-3) enhanced the ability of the best-performing established CSF biomarker, the tau/Aβ42 ratio, to discriminate CDR>0 from CDR 0 individuals. Multiple machine learning algorithms likewise showed that the novel biomarker panels improved the diagnostic performance of the current leading biomarkers. Importantly, most of the markers that best discriminated CDR 0 from CDR>0 individuals in the more targeted ROC analyses were also identified as top predictors in the machine learning models, reconfirming their potential as biomarkers for early-stage AD. Cox proportional hazards models demonstrated that an optimal panel of markers for predicting risk of developing cognitive impairment (CDR 0 to CDR>0 conversion) consisted of calbindin, Aβ42, and age.Using a targeted proteomic screen, we identified novel candidate biomarkers that complement the best current CSF biomarkers for distinguishing very mildly/mildly demented from cognitively normal individuals. Additionally, we identified a novel biomarker (calbindin) with significant prognostic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2024302723,"Fibrobacter succinogenes is an important member of the rumen microbial community that converts plant biomass into nutrients usable by its host. This bacterium, which is also one of only two cultivated species in its phylum, is an efficient and prolific degrader of cellulose. Specifically, it has a particularly high activity against crystalline cellulose that requires close physical contact with this substrate. However, unlike other known cellulolytic microbes, it does not degrade cellulose using a cellulosome or by producing high extracellular titers of cellulase enzymes. To better understand the biology of F. succinogenes, we sequenced the genome of the type strain S85 to completion. A total of 3,085 open reading frames were predicted from its 3.84 Mbp genome. Analysis of sequences predicted to encode for carbohydrate-degrading enzymes revealed an unusually high number of genes that were classified into 49 different families of glycoside hydrolases, carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs), carbohydrate esterases, and polysaccharide lyases. Of the 31 identified cellulases, none contain CBMs in families 1, 2, and 3, typically associated with crystalline cellulose degradation. Polysaccharide hydrolysis and utilization assays showed that F. succinogenes was able to hydrolyze a number of polysaccharides, but could only utilize the hydrolytic products of cellulose. This suggests that F. succinogenes uses its array of hemicellulose-degrading enzymes to remove hemicelluloses to gain access to cellulose. This is reflected in its genome, as F. succinogenes lacks many of the genes necessary to transport and metabolize the hydrolytic products of non-cellulose polysaccharides. The F. succinogenes genome reveals a bacterium that specializes in cellulose as its sole energy source, and provides insight into a novel strategy for cellulose degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1980061215,"Background Urbanization is the most prevailing cause of habitat transformation worldwide, differing from others by its intense levels of human activity. Despite its obvious impact on wildlife, it is still unclear why and how some species are able to adapt to urban settings. One possibility is that fear of humans and vehicles could preclude most species from invading cities. Species entering urban environments might be those that are more tolerant of human disturbance (i.e., tame species). Alternatively or in addition, urban invaders could be a fraction of variable species, with “tame” individuals invading urban habitats and other individuals remaining in rural areas. Methodology Using the contemporary urban invasion by birds in a recently established South American city, we tested both hypotheses by relating interspecific differences in invasiveness to their flight initiation distances (i.e., the distances at which birds flee from approaching cars, FID), as well as to their relative brain size (RBS), a correlate of measures of behavioral flexibility. Principal Findings Urban invasiveness was not significantly related to species' average rural FIDs but positively related to their RBS and inter-individual variability in FID. Moreover, FIDs were consistently lower in urban than in rural conspecifics, and the FIDs of urban individuals were within the lower-range distribution of their rural conspecifics. RBS indirectly influenced urban invasion through its positive effect on inter-individual variability in FID. Conclusions/Significance Urban invaders do not appear to be individuals from apparently tame species, but rather tame individuals from species with a variable response regarding fear of people. Given the positive relationship between RBS and inter-individual variability in FID, our results suggest that behavioural flexibility should be regarded as a specific trait encompassing variability among individuals. Further research is needed to ascertain the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the relationship between brain size and inter-individual variability in behavioural traits."
https://openalex.org/W1973703047,"Formation of a protected biofilm environment is recognized as one of the major causes of the increasing antibiotic resistance development and emphasizes the need to develop alternative antibacterial strategies, like phage therapy. This study investigates the in vitro degradation of single-species Pseudomonas putida biofilms, PpG1 and RD5PR2, by the novel phage ϕ15, a 'T7-like virus' with a virion-associated exopolysaccharide (EPS) depolymerase. Phage ϕ15 forms plaques surrounded by growing opaque halo zones, indicative for EPS degradation, on seven out of 53 P. putida strains. The absence of haloes on infection resistant strains suggests that the EPS probably act as a primary bacterial receptor for phage infection. Independent of bacterial strain or biofilm age, a time and dose dependent response of ϕ15-mediated biofilm degradation was observed with generally a maximum biofilm degradation 8 h after addition of the higher phage doses (10(4) and 10(6) pfu) and resistance development after 24 h. Biofilm age, an in vivo very variable parameter, reduced markedly phage-mediated degradation of PpG1 biofilms, while degradation of RD5PR2 biofilms and ϕ15 amplification were unaffected. Killing of the planktonic culture occurred in parallel with but was always more pronounced than biofilm degradation, accentuating the need for evaluating phages for therapeutic purposes in biofilm conditions. EPS degrading activity of recombinantly expressed viral tail spike was confirmed by capsule staining. These data suggests that the addition of high initial titers of specifically selected phages with a proper EPS depolymerase are crucial criteria in the development of phage therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2072394478,"Background DNA barcoding, the analysis of sequence variation in the 5′ region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene, has been shown to provide an efficient method for the identification of species in a wide range of animal taxa. In order to assess the effectiveness of barcodes in the discrimination of Heteroptera, we examined 344 species belonging to 178 genera, drawn from specimens in the Canadian National Collection of Insects. Methodology/Principal Findings Analysis of the COI gene revealed less than 2% intra-specific divergence in 90% of the taxa examined, while minimum interspecific distances exceeded 3% in 77% of congeneric species pairs. Instances where barcodes fail to distinguish species represented clusters of morphologically similar species, except one case of barcode identity between species in different genera. Several instances of deep intraspecific divergence were detected suggesting possible cryptic species. Conclusions/Significance Although this analysis encompasses 0.8% of the described global fauna, our results indicate that DNA barcodes will aid the identification of Heteroptera. This advance will be useful in pest management, regulatory and environmental applications and will also reveal species that require further taxonomic research."
https://openalex.org/W2005133525,"To elucidate the relationship between intragenic DNA methylation and chromatin marks, we performed epigenetic profiling of chromosome 19 in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) and in the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 as well as its counterpart with double knockout of DNMT1 and DNMT3B (HCT116-DKO). Analysis of H3K36me3 profiles indicated that this intragenic mark of active genes is associated with two categories of genes: (i) genes with low CpG density and H3K9me3 in the gene body or (ii) genes with high CpG density and DNA methylation in the gene body. We observed that a combination of low CpG density in gene bodies together with H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 occupancy is a specific epigenetic feature of zinc finger (ZNF) genes, which comprise 90% of all genes carrying both histone marks on chromosome 19. For genes with high intragenic CpG density, transcription and H3K36me3 occupancy were not changed in conditions of partial or intensive loss of DNA methylation in gene bodies. siRNA knockdown of SETD2, the major histone methyltransferase responsible for production of H3K36me3, did not reduce DNA methylation in gene bodies. Our study suggests that the H3K36me3 and DNA methylation marks in gene bodies are established largely independently of each other and points to similar functional roles of intragenic DNA methylation and intragenic H3K9me3 for CpG-rich and CpG-poor genes, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2086337422,"The interaction of brain lipids with α-synuclein may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an abundant fatty acid of neuronal membranes, and it is presents at high levels in brain areas with α-synuclein inclusions of patients with PD. In animal models, an increase of DHA content in the brain induces α-synuclein oligomer formation in vivo. However, it is not clear whether these oligomeric species are the precursors of the larger aggregates found in Lewy bodies of post-mortem PD brains. To characterize these species and to define the role of fatty acids in amyloid formation, we investigated the aggregation process of α-synuclein in the presence of DHA. We found that DHA readily promotes α-synuclein aggregation and that the morphology of these aggregates is dependent on the ratio between the protein and DHA. In the presence of a molar ratio protein/DHA of 1:10, amyloid-like fibrils are formed. These fibrils are morphologically different from those formed by α-synuclein alone and have a less packed structure. At a protein/DHA molar ratio of 1:50, we observe the formation of stable oligomers. Moreover, chemical modifications, methionine oxidations, and protein-lipid adduct formations are induced by increasing concentrations of DHA. The extent of these modifications defines the structure and the stability of aggregates. We also show that α-synuclein oligomers are more toxic if generated in the presence of DHA in dopaminergic neuronal cell lines, suggesting that these species might be important in the neurodegenerative process associated with PD.

Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region (approximately residues 1–60) of α-syn contains an 11-amino acid repeat sequence with a highly conserved hexameric motif (KTKEGV) and acquires an amphipathic helical structure upon interaction with an anionic membrane surface (5Davidson W.S.

The central region (residues 61–95) includes the highly amyloidogenic NAC sequence, responsible for amyloid-like fibril formation. The carboxyl-terminal region (residues 96–140) is enriched in acidic and proline residues, and it is suggested to play an important role in modulating the aggregation properties of the protein (6Hoyer W.

It has been demonstrated that α-syn binds to abundant cerebral polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), such as arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA). Interestingly, α-syn is also implicated in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism (11Golovko M.Y. Rosenberger T.A. Faergeman N.J. Feddersen S. Cole N.B. Pribill I. Berger J. Nussbaum R.L.

Moreover, the appearance of α-syn toxic oligomers in vivo has been linked to the presence of long PUFAs in the brain (13Perrin R.J. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol.

Pathol. 2007; 171: 2000-2011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The functional correlation of α-syn with brain lipids provides a critical link between oxidative stress and the onset of PD. Indeed, oxidative stress is a risk factor in PD, because the brain is particularly susceptible to neuronal damage caused by reactive oxygen species, due to the relative lack of antioxidant defense mechanisms (17Grimsrud P.A. Xie H. Griffin T.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21837-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Neurons have a high content of PUFA whose peroxidation leads to the formation of reactive aldehydes and ketones, able to induce covalent modifications in proteins. In the case of α-syn, such chemical changes seem to affect the process of aggregation and potentially the onset of PD. Moreover, in vitro studies have shown that the lipid oxidation product, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, covalently binds to α-syn. As a consequence, α-syn can no longer form fibrils but only oligomeric species, which have been suggested to contribute to the damage of neurons subjected to oxidative stress (18Qin Z. Hu D. Han S. Reaney S.H. Di Monte D.A. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5862-5870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, it was found that α-syn can act as scavenger of ROS, preventing unsaturated lipids oxidation in vesicles by the oxidation of the methionine residues to methionine-sulfoxide (19Zhu M. Qin Z.J. Hu D. Munishkina L.A. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8135-8142Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Given the decrease in hydrophobicity, the oxidized protein is not only less prone to form oligomers and fibrils, but even able to inhibit the fibrillation of unmodified α-syn (20Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 21Glaser C.B. Yamin G. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, α-syn oligomers, formed under oxidative conditions, are not degraded by the proteasome (22Cole N.B. Murphy D.D. Lebowitz J. Di Noto L. Levine R.L. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9678-9690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A study on the fatty acid-induced α-syn aggregation aimed to define the molecular mechanism and the structural organization of the products due to lipid peroxidation is still missing. It is unclear whether the oligomerization and chemical modification of α-syn are independent or, instead, tightly linked processes. In support of a functional interplay between α-syn modification and oligomer formation, it was reported that exposure of cultured dopaminergic cells to PUFA results in the formation of α-syn oligomers, associated with cytotoxicity (16Assayag K. Yakunin E. Loeb V. Selkoe D.J. Sharon R. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 171: 2000-2011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We previously observed a mutual effect in the interaction between monomeric α-syn and DHA in vitro (23De Franceschi G. Frare E. Bubacco L. Mammi S. Fontana A. de Laureto P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394: 94-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). DHA is induced to form small oil droplets. α-syn acquires an α-helical secondary structure with a rapid equilibrium between its free and the lipid-bound form. In the α-helical form, the protein segment 73–102 is flexible and is not characterized by a persistent structure. Considering that prolonged exposure of α-syn to fatty acids induces oligomerization of the protein (15Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M. Hamilton J.A. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2003; 37: 583-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), in this study we further analyze the aggregation process of α-syn in the presence of DHA and evaluate the effects of the formed oligomers on cell viability. DHA was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and were obtained from Sigma or Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Aliquots of DHA were stored at a concentration of 76 mm in 100% ethanol at −80 °C under a helium atmosphere to prevent oxidation. Human α-synuclein was expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cell line transfected with the pET28b/α-syn plasmid. Overexpression of the protein was achieved by growing cells in LB medium at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 0.6 followed by induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. The purification of the recombinant protein was conducted following a procedure described previously with minor modifications (23De Franceschi G. Frare E. Bubacco L. Mammi S. Fontana A. de Laureto P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394: 94-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Huang C. Ren G. Zhou H. Wang C.C. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 42: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Further purification was obtained by RP-HPLC, and the identity and integrity of the eluted material were assessed by mass spectrometry. To analyze the aggregation process of α-syn, samples were incubated at 37 °C for up to 30 days at a protein concentration of 50 μm, in PBS (8 mm Na2HPO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4), in the presence of DHA (0.5 and 2.5 mm) to obtain a protein/fatty acid molar ratio of 1:10 and 1:50, under shaking at 500 rpm with a thermo-mixer (Compact, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The same control experiment was conducted in the absence of DHA. Aliquots of the samples, collected at the indicated time points during incubation, were examined by native- and SDS-PAGE, thioflavin T (ThT) binding assay, circular dichroism (CD), FTIR spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), gel filtration (GF) chromatography, and RP-HPLC. SDS- and native-PAGE were performed with a Mini-PROTEAN II Bio-Rad electrophoresis system using a Tris-HCl 13% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. Native gel (nondenaturing) was performed on the same system without SDS in gel and in running or loading buffers. The bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue or Silver staining. Approximately 5 μg of protein were loaded into each well. The ThT binding assays were performed accordingly to LeVine (25LeVine 3rd, H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar) using a 25 μm ThT solution in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. Aliquots (30 μl) of protein samples containing aggregates were taken at specified times and diluted into the ThT buffer. Fluorescence emission measurements were conducted at 25 °C using an excitation wavelength of 440 nm and recording the ThT fluorescence emission at 484 nm. Protein concentrations were determined by absorption measurements at 280 nm using a double-beam Lambda-20 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The molar absorptivity at 280 nm for α-syn was 5960 cm−1 m−1, as evaluated from its amino acid composition by the method of Gill and von Hippel (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco (Tokyo, Japan) J-710 spectropolarimeter, using a 1-mm path length quartz cell and a protein concentration of 8 μm. The mean residue ellipticity [θ] (degree·cm2·dmol−1) was calculated from the formula [θ] = (θobs/10)·(MRW/lc), where θobs is the observed ellipticity in degrees; MRW is the mean residue molecular weight of the protein; l the optical path length in cm; and c is the protein concentration in g/ml. The spectra were recorded in PBS. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted on a 1720× spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). α-syn was suspended in D2O for 1 h to allow the hydrogen to deuterium exchange and then was lyophilized under vacuum. The spectra were recorded on protein samples in the absence and presence of DHA and after 15 days of incubation. For the samples corresponding to α-syn alone or in the presence of DHA (P/DHA 1:10), the aggregated species were isolated by ultracentrifugation (380,000 × g) and redissolved in 20 mm Tris-DCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5* (uncorrected for isotopic effects), at 5 mg/ml. In the case of soluble oligomers induced by protein (P)/DHA 1:50, we have recorded an FTIR spectrum of the whole mixture after 15 days of incubation at a final protein concentration of 0.7 mg/ml. Samples were placed between CaF2 windows, separated by a 50-μm thick Mylar spacer. The samples and the detector compartment were thoroughly purged with N2. Spectra represent averages of 50 scans recorded between 4000 and 1000 cm−1 at a resolution of 2 cm−1. All spectra were base-line-corrected, blank-subtracted, and smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter by Grams 32 program version 4.14 (Galactic Industries Corp., Salem, NH). The second derivative of the amide I band was used to identify the different spectral components. Curve fitting was performed with Gaussian and Lorentzian line shapes, with bandwidths varying between 15 and 25 cm−1 (27Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar, 28Arrondo J.L. Muga A. Castresana J. Goñi F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 23-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). To evaluate the morphology and the size of the aggregates, aliquots of the samples were examined by transmission electron microscopy. For the negative staining, a drop of the sample solution was placed on a Butvar-coated copper grid (400-square mesh) (TAAB-Laboratories Equipment Ltd., Berks, UK), dried, and negatively stained with a drop of uranyl acetate solution (1%, w/v). TEM pictures were taken on a Tecnai G2 12 Twin instrument (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR), operating at an excitation voltage of 100 kV. For AFM measurements, the aggregate suspensions were diluted 500 times using Milli-Q water, and 10-μl aliquots of each sample were deposited on freshly cleaved mica and dried under mild vacuum. Sample dilution was performed to avoid the formation of salt crystals upon sample drying. Tapping mode AFM images were acquired in air using a Dimension 3100 scanning probe microscope equipped with a “G” scanning head (maximum scan size 100 μm) and driven by a Nanoscope IIIa controller and a Multimode scanning probe microscope equipped with an “E” scanning head (maximum scan size 10 μm) and driven by a Nanoscope IV controller (Digital Instruments, Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA). Single beam uncoated silicon cantilevers (type Olympus OMCL-AC160TS, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) were employed. The drive frequency was between 280 and 300 kHz, and the scan rate was between 0.5 and 2.0 Hz. Aggregate sizes were measured from the heights in cross-section in the topographic AFM images. Gel filtration chromatography was performed with a Superdex 75 10/300GL column (Amersham Biosciences), using an ÄKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Aliquots (200 μl) of samples taken from the aggregation mixture were loaded into the column and eluted at 0.4 ml/min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4. The effluent was monitored by recording the absorbance at 214 nm. The molecular weight value for the α-syn samples was estimated using the following standards: blue dextran, 2000 kDa; β-amylase, 200 kDa; albumin, 67 kDa; ovalbumin, 45 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa, α-lactalbumin, 14.4 kDa and aprotinin, 6.5 kDa. The HPLC analyses were conducted using a Jupiter C4 column (4.6 × 150 mm; Phenomenex, CA) eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile, 0.085% TFA versus water, 0.1% TFA from 5 to 38% in 5 min and from 38 to 43% in 15 min. The effluent was monitored by recording the absorbance at 226 nm. The identity of the eluted material was assessed by mass spectrometry and carried out with an electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometer with a Q-Tof analyzer (Micro) (Waters Associates, Manchester, UK). The measurements were conducted at a capillary voltage of 2.5 kV and a cone voltage of 30–35 V. Dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 0.5 μm α-syn or α-syn/DHA 1:50 either before or after incubation for 48 h as described above. α-Syn/DHA samples have been further subjected to size exclusion chromatography to isolate the oligomeric species. α-Syn/DHA 1:50 sample has been also ultrafiltrated with VivaSpin (membrane 5000 molecular weight cutoff PES, VivaScience Ltd., Stonehouse, UK) to separate α-syn/DHA oligomers (retentate fraction) from smaller products such as DHA autoxidation (filtrate fraction). After 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for DNA double strand breaks using a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were also stained with monoclonal anti-α-syn antibodies (BD Biosciences) and counterstained with Hoechst 33242. TUNEL-positive cells were counted in three replicate cultures, acquiring an average of 15–30 fields per culture. The experiment has been repeated three times independently. α-syn was incubated in the absence and in the presence of DHA (molar ratio protein/fatty acid, P/DHA, of 1:10 and 1:50) at a protein concentration of 50 μm in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C, under shaking. The effect of DHA on α-syn aggregation kinetics was monitored by native (Fig. 1, A–C), SDS- (Fig. 1D) PAGE and ThT fluorescence assay (Fig. 1E). In the absence of DHA, α-syn migrates as a compact band, whereas its relative intensity is reduced as aggregation proceeds (Fig. 1A). After 144 h of incubation, the presence of precipitated protein material in the loading wells indicates the formation of high molecular weight aggregates. Incubating the protein in the presence of DHA (Fig. 1, B and C), we observe novel species with reduced gel mobility when compared with the monomer. Bands with lower mobility increase during incubation. This evidence suggests a significant degree of aggregation, which increases over time and is consistent with the formation of dimers, trimers, tetramers, and further higher molecular weight species. Within 24 h of incubation, insoluble gel-excluded protein species were detected (Fig. 1B). Strong bands in the upper range of the native gels are visible at the interface between the resolving and stacking gel, and their intensity does not change over time. They could be due to products of generic protein aggregation. Aliquots taken from the mixture of α-syn incubated with DHA (P/DHA 1:50) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D), showing that the aggregates are SDS-resistant, as reported previously (12Golovko M.Y. Rosenberger T.A. Feddersen S. Faergeman N.J. Murphy E.J. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Perrin R.J. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8135-8142Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To further analyze the solubility properties of these aggregates, the samples were treated with DMSO and than loaded onto a SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1B), without any detectable effect. The aggregation of α-syn was followed by ThT fluorescence assay (Fig. 1E). The increase in ThT signal observed during the incubation of α-syn in PBS buffer follows a sigmoid curve and is consistent with an amyloid nucleation-dependent aggregation process (29Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Biere A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19509-19512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In the case of the aggregation conducted in the presence of DHA using a P/DHA of 1:10, the fluorescence of the dye starts to increase rapidly, and a plateau was reached within 10 h. In the case of the aggregation conducted using a P/DHA of 1:50, samples do not produce any increase of ThT fluorescence, suggesting the absence of ordered amyloid-like structures able to selectively bind the dye. To evaluate the possibility that the species formed in the presence of DHA could be on-pathway intermediates in the α-syn fibril formation process, their seeding properties have been tested (Fig. 1F). The samples used for seeding were as follows: 1) fibrils from α-syn incubated for 15 days (named SA); 2) ThT-positive samples from α-syn incubated for 72 h in the presence of DHA (molar ratio P/DHA 1:10) (SB); and 3) ThT-negative samples from α-syn in the presence of DHA (P/DHA 1:50) for 72 h (SC). The addition of preformed ThT-positive α-syn aggregates, obtained in the absence or in the presence of DHA (P/DHA 1:10), causes the seeding of α-syn, as evidenced by the increase of the ThT signal of seeded samples compared with α-syn alone after 72 h of incubation. Conversely, the species formed in the presence of a high amount of DHA (SC) do not exert any seeding effect. The structural characterization of the species formed during aggregation was conducted using both circular dichroism (CD) (Fig. 2) and FTIR (Fig. 3). In the absence of DHA, α-syn undergoes a conformational transition from random to β-sheet structure during incubation (Fig. 2A). In the presence of DHA (P/DHA 1:10), the CD measurement shows a contribution of both α-helical and random structure, indicating that about 65% of α-syn molecules are unfolded (Fig. 2B), as described previously (23De Franceschi G. Frare E. Bubacco L. Mammi S. Fontana A. de Laureto P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394: 94-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Within a few hours, the shape of the spectrum starts to change with a decrease of the minima relative to α-helical structure and the appearance of a new signal at about 218 nm, characteristic of β-sheet structure (48 h). The CD spectrum of α-syn incubated at P/DHA 1:50 shows that the protein acquires an α-helical structure (Fig. 2C). Although the spectrum shape does not change over time, the intensity of the CD signals slightly decreases during incubation.FIGURE 3FTIR spectroscopy. FTIR spectra of α-syn in the absence (A and B) and in the presence of DHA in ratio P/DHA of 1:10 (C and D) and of 1:50 (E and F) are shown. The spectra were obtained on samples just prepared (left column) and after 15 days of incubation (right column). The second derivatives of the amide I bands (dashed line) were used to identify the different spectral components. For details about samples preparation see “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The FTIR spectra were recorded on α-syn samples in the absence and in the presence of DHA (Fig. 3, left column) and after 15 days of incubation (Fig. 3, right column). The FTIR spectrum of the protein before incubation is indicative of a natively unfolded structure (Fig. 3A), as confirmed by the presence of a prevalent band at 1640 cm−1 in its second derivative spectrum (Fig. 3A, dashed line). After 15 days of incubation, the spectrum of α-syn shows a reduction of the band at 1640 cm−1 and the appearance of a band at 1614 cm−1, previously assigned to aggregated β-structure (Fig. 3B, dashed line) (28Arrondo J.L. Muga A. Castresana J. Goñi F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 23-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The second derivative FTIR spectrum of α-syn in the presence of 1:10 DHA before incubation shows a band centered at 1640 cm−1, indicative of a random structure (Fig. 3C), and after 15 days of incubation, the main band is shifted to 1614 cm−1, corresponding to cross-β-sheet (Fig. 3D). The second derivative spectrum of α-syn/DHA in a ratio of 1:50 before incubation shows the presence of a main band centered at 1648 cm−1, corresponding to α-helix (Fig. 3E, dashed line). After incubation, the FTIR spectrum shows the presence of α-helical structure (band at 1659 cm−1), random structure (band at 1640 cm−1), and cross-β-structure (band at 1614 cm−1) (Fig. 3F). In Table 1 the calculated secondary structure content of α-syn in the absence and in the presence of DHA is reported. The quantitative analysis performed with curve-fitting procedures indicates that α-syn before incubation and in the absence of DHA contains a prevalence of random structure (83%, band at 1640 cm−1), and in the presence of 1:10 DHA α-syn contains a mixture of random (76%) and α-helix structure (9%, band at 1658 cm−1), and in the presence of 1:50 DHA a prevalence of α-helix structure was evidenced (61%, band at 1648 cm−1). Interestingly, aggregates formed by α-syn alone contain a higher amount of cross-β-structure (47%, calculated from the sum of the contribution of the bands at 1612–1626 and 1680–1690 cm−1) than aggregates formed in the presence of DHA (P/DHA 1:10) (34%). Of note, the cross-β-structure content in α-syn samples aggregated in the presence of DHA (P/DHA 1:50) is only 10% (Table 1). Moreover, the presence of the fatty acid is correlated to significant differences in the intensity of the band (1640 cm−1) corresponding to residual random structure in the aggregated species (13% for α-syn, 65% for P/DHA 1:10 and 35% for P/DHA 1:50). Only aggregates formed in the presence of DHA (P/DHA 1:50) maintain α-helical structure (55%, band at 1659 cm−1) (Table 1).TABLE 1Secondary structure c"
https://openalex.org/W1981693015,"Background To date, the only estimate of the heritability of telomere length in wild populations comes from humans. Thus, there is a need for analysis of natural populations with respect to how telomeres evolve. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we show that telomere length is heritable in free-ranging sand lizards, Lacerta agilis. More importantly, heritability estimates analysed within, and contrasted between, the sexes are markedly different; son-sire heritability is much higher relative to daughter-dam heritability. We assess the effect of paternal age on Telomere Length (TL) and show that in this species, paternal age at conception is the best predictor of TL in sons. Neither paternal age per se at blood sampling for telomere screening, nor corresponding age in sons impact TL in sons. Processes maintaining telomere length are also associated with negative fitness effects, most notably by increasing the risk of cancer and show variation across different categories of individuals (e.g. males vs. females). We therefore tested whether TL influences offspring survival in their first year of life. Indeed such effects were present and independent of sex-biased offspring mortality and offspring malformations. Conclusions/Significance TL show differences in sex-specific heritability with implications for differences between the sexes with respect to ongoing telomere selection. Paternal age influences the length of telomeres in sons and longer telomeres enhance offspring survival."
https://openalex.org/W1974175465,"Increasing attention is now being given to the epigenetic regulation of animal and human behaviors including the stress response and drug addiction. Epigenetic factors also influence feeding behavior and metabolic phenotypes, such as obesity and insulin sensitivity. In response to fasting and high-fat diets, the medial hypothalamus changes the expression of neuropeptides regulating feeding, metabolism, and reproductive behaviors. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in the epigenetic control of gene expression and alter behavior in response to a variety of environmental factors. Here, we examined the expression of HDAC family members in the medial hypothalamus of mice in response to either fasting or a high-fat diet. In response to fasting, HDAC3 and -4 expression levels increased while HDAC10 and -11 levels decreased. Four weeks on a high-fat diet resulted in the increased expression of HDAC5 and -8. Moreover, fasting decreased the number of acetylated histone H3- and acetylated histone H4-positive cells in the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus. Therefore, HDACs may be implicated in altered gene expression profiles in the medial hypothalamus under different metabolic states."
https://openalex.org/W2034036012,"The aggressiveness of melanoma tumors is likely to rely on their well-recognized heterogeneity and plasticity. Melanoma comprises multi-subpopulations of cancer cells some of which may possess stem cell-like properties. Although useful, the sphere-formation assay to identify stem cell-like or tumor initiating cell subpopulations in melanoma has been challenged, and it is unclear if this model can predict a functional phenotype associated with aggressive tumor cells.We analyzed the molecular and functional phenotypes of melanoma spheroids formed in neural crest cell medium. Whether from metastatic or advanced primary tumors, spheroid cells expressed melanoma-associated markers. They displayed higher capacity to differentiate along mesenchymal lineages and enhanced expression of SOX2, NANOG, KLF4, and/or OCT4 transcription factors, but not enhanced self-renewal or tumorigenicity when compared to their adherent counterparts. Gene expression profiling attributed a neural crest cell signature to these spheroids and indicated that a migratory/invasive and immune-function modulating program could be associated with these cells. In vitro assays confirmed that spheroids display enhanced migratory/invasive capacities. In immune activation assays, spheroid cells elicited a poorer allogenic response from immune cells and inhibited mitogen-dependent T cells activation and proliferation more efficiently than their adherent counterparts. Our findings reveal a novel immune-modulator function of melanoma spheroids and suggest specific roles for spheroids in invasion and in evasion of antitumor immunity.The association of a more plastic, invasive and evasive, thus a more aggressive tumor phenotype with melanoma spheroids reveals a previously unrecognized aspect of tumor cells expanded as spheroid cultures. While of limited efficiency for melanoma initiating cell identification, our melanoma spheroid model predicted aggressive phenotype and suggested that aggressiveness and heterogeneity of melanoma tumors can be supported by subpopulations other than cancer stem cells. Therefore, it could be constructive to investigate melanoma aggressiveness, relevant to patients and clinical transferability."
https://openalex.org/W2070021953,"Tumors of the central nervous system represent a major source of cancer-related deaths, with medulloblastoma and glioblastoma being the most common malignant brain tumors in children and adults respectively. While significant advances in treatment have been made, with the 5-year survival rate for medulloblastoma at 70-80%, treating patients under 3 years of age still poses a problem due to the deleterious effects of radiation on the developing brain, and the median survival for patients with glioblastoma is only 15 months. The transcription factor, STAT3, has been found constitutively activated in a wide variety of cancers and in recent years it has become an attractive therapeutic target. We designed a non-peptide small molecule STAT3 inhibitor, LLL12, using structure-based design. LLL12 was able to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation, decrease cell viability and induce apoptosis in medulloblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines with elevated levels of p-STAT3 (Y705). IC(50) values for LLL12 were found to be between 1.07 µM and 5.98 µM in the five cell lines expressing phosphorylated STAT3. STAT3 target genes were found to be downregulated and a decrease in STAT3 DNA binding was observed following LLL12 treatment, indicating that LLL12 is an effective STAT3 inhibitor. LLL12 was also able to inhibit colony formation, wound healing and decreased IL-6 and LIF secretion. Our results suggest that LLL12 is a potent STAT3 inhibitor and that it may be a potential therapeutic treatment for medulloblastoma and glioblastoma."

Furusawa T. Ueda T. Bustin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 72-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). HMGB1 is an exceptional member in the family of HMG-box proteins; depending on the cell type and its activation state, HMGB1 displays a nonnuclear localization and is secreted from cells, in contrast to most HMG-box proteins that are strictly bound to the cell nuclei (for recent reviews, see Refs. 2Rauvala H. Rouhiainen A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1799: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and 3Stros M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1799: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). During the last few years, the extensive literature dealing with HMGB1 functions has mainly focused on extracellular regulation of cells by HMGB1. HMGB1 can be passively released from injured cells, but it is also actively secreted due to several types of stimuli such as cell contact with extracellular matrix and cytokine stimulation of cells (2Rauvala H. Rouhiainen A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1799: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Acetylation of lysine residues of HMGB1 has been shown to act as a signal leading to extracellular export via a non-classical secretory pathway (4Bonaldi T. Talamo F. Scaffidi P. Ferrera D. Porto A. Bachi A. Rubartelli A. Agresti A. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5551-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). HMGB1 functions are currently mainly associated with binding to the cell surface receptor RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products), but Toll-like receptors have been increasingly suggested as membrane receptors of HMGB1 (for review, see Ref. 2Rauvala H.

Compared with the extensive recent literature dealing with the pathophysiological roles of HMGB1 in inflammation, much less attention has been paid to its physiological roles. The Hmgb1 knock-out mouse survives until early postnatal age, and problems in glucose homeostasis have been suggested to cause multiorgan failure in these mice (5Calogero S. Grassi F. Aguzzi A. Voigtländer T. Ferrier P. Ferrari S. Bianchi M.E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). HMGB1 was isolated from developing rat brain using neurite outgrowth in embryonic forebrain neurons as a readout in protein fractionation (6Rauvala H. Pihlaskari R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16625-16635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies provided the initial evidence of HMGB1 as an extracellularly acting protein (6Rauvala H. Pihlaskari R. J.

HMGB1 was found to bind strongly to heparin/heparan sulfate and to be highly expressed in embryonic rat brain (6Rauvala H. Pihlaskari R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16625-16635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RAGE acts as a receptor in HMGB1-induced extension of neurites (for review, see Ref. 2Rauvala H. Rouhiainen A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1799: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, exogenously added HMGB1 has been shown to enhance survival of neuronal cells in a RAGE-dependent manner (9Huttunen H.J. Kuja-Panula J. Sorci G. Agneletti A.L. Donato R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40096-40105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In cancer cells, HMGB1 has been shown to bind to RAGE and to enhance tumor growth and spread (10Taguchi A. Blood D.C. del Toro G. Canet A. Lee D.C. Qu W. Tanji N. Lu Y. Lalla E. Fu C.

Despite these in vitro and in vivo findings, which would be compatible with a developmental role for HMGB1, its possible role in brain development has not been explored. The forebrain is the part of the nervous system that has undergone the most dramatic changes during vertebrate evolution. The early organization of the forebrain subdomains is conserved in all vertebrates. To understand the origins of the vertebrate forebrain, comparisons of gene expression patterns have been recently carried out in several nonvertebrate and early vertebrate organisms (see for example Refs. 11Guérin A. d'Aubenton-Carafa Y.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) representing species at the dawn of the vertebrate brain development. Hmgb1 is highly expressed in early embryonic brain and might, therefore, have a role in the development of ancestral forms of complex brain structures. The findings explained above, neurite outgrowth-promoting and survival-enhancing effects on cultured neuronal cells and high expression in early brain structures, raise the question of whether Hmgb1 would be one of the genes required for brain development. In the current study we have addressed this question using zebrafish as a vertebrate model in which development of different nervous system structures can be easily followed. HMGB1 knockdown experiments in vivo using morpholino oligonucleotides clearly demonstrate defects in brain development, in particular in anterior neural structures. We suggest that in developing forebrain, HMGB1 is required for maintenance of proliferating cells/stem cells that give rise to neurons. An outbred zebrafish (Danio rerio) strain from a local resource, Turku line, was used in this study for its steady yield of embryos (14Chen Y.C. Priyadarshini M. Panula P. Histochem.

Fish feeding, breeding, and maintenance were done according to Westerfield (16Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio). 4th Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR2000Google Scholar). The experiment permits were obtained from the University of Helsinki Committee for animal experiments and the Office of the Regional Government of Southern Finland, in agreement with the ethical guidelines of the European convention. We express the embryonic ages in hours post-fertilization (hpf) and days post-fertilization (dpf). To prevent pigment formation, 0.2 mm 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (Sigma) was added to the media of embryos to be studied before 3 dpf shortly after spawning. Total RNA from 2 dpf larvae was extracted with NucleoSpin RNA XS kit. RNA was reverse-transcribed in a reaction containing 1 μg of RNA, 0.25 mm dNTP-mix, 1 mm random nonamers, 20 units of recombinant RNasin® (Promega), 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV)-RT (Promega) in 1× MMLV reaction buffer. 2 μl of the reverse transcription mixture was then used for polymerase chain reaction with gene-specific primers. The primers 5′-ACA TCC ACA TAC AGC CAT TGC-3′ and 5′-GGC AAG GAT AGT GGT GTT GGA-3′ were used for cloning the 963-bp zebrafish HMGB1 full-length transcripts of coding sequence (supplemental Fig. S1). The primers 5′-AAG TCA CCG CCA TCA ACG AC-3′ and 5′-ACA ACG GAC ACA TCA ACG AC-3′ of zebrafish GAPDH (gene ID 317743) were used for relative PCR template control. The subsequent PCR reaction was performed in a 50-μl PCR mix (2.5 μm dNTP, 150 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8) containing 0.2 μm 5′ primer and 3′ primer and 1 unit of Dy-NAzymeTM II DNA Polymerase or Phusion high fidelity polymerase (Finnzymes). The PCR cycling parameter was set at 95 °C for 5 min, denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing/detection at 60 °C for 30 s, elongation at 72 °C for 1 min, back to denaturation for 29 cycles and then at 72 °C for 5 min, and holding at 4 °C. The amplification products were separated on 1.0% agarose gel and stained with EtBr. The PCR products were purified with the MinElute Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), ligated to the pGEM-Teasy plasmid (Promega), and sequenced. The zebrafish β-actin1 (AF057040.1, GI:3044209; primers are 5′-CGA GCA GGA GAT GGG AAC C-3′ and 5′- CAA CGG AAA CGC TCA TTG C-3′), elongation factor 1 α1 (zgc:109885, GI:90652818; primers are 5′-CCA ACT TCA ACG CTC AGG TCA-3′ and 5′-CAA ACT TGC AGG CGA TGT GA-3′), and ribosomal protein L13a (BC047855.1, GI:28838761; primers are 5′-AGA GAA AGC GCA TGG TTG TCC-3′ and 5′-GCC TGG TAC TTC CAG CCA ACT T-3′) were set as template quantity controls for quantitative real time PCR.

Wnt8a1 (BC055535.1, GI:33416858; primers are 5′-TTG CGT CGT TGG TTA TGT CT-3′ and 5′-TAC ACT GCT GGT GTA TGC GA-3′), Wnt8a2 (U10869.2, GI:14574562; primers are 5′-TAA TGA AGC TGG ACG TTT GG-3′ and 5′-TAA TTG CCA ATC TCA CGG AA-3′), and Wnt8b (U10870.1, GI:968916; primers are 5′-TGC AGT GAT AAC GTG GGA TT-3′ and 5′-GTC CTC TGC ATG GTT CCT TT-3′) primers were designed with online tools (GenScript). The LuminoCtTM SYBR Green qPCR ReadyMixTM (Sigma) was used. The typical cycling parameters were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, denaturation at 95 °C for 5 s, annealing/detect at 62 °C for 30 s, back to denaturation for 39 cycles, hold at 4 °C. The PCR reactions were processed with the Bio-Rad CFX96 real time PCR machine via CFX96TM Real-Time PCR Detection System. The 615-bp zebrafish HMGB1 sequence encoding the full-length HMGB1 polypeptide from the start methionine was amplified by PCR with two pairs of primers with added restriction enzyme digestion sites required for ligation with double multi-clone sites pEGFP plasmid (derived from pEGFP-C1, Clontech). The first pair of primers was 5′-AGA ATG CGG CCG CCA CCA TGG GGA AGG ATC CGA CAA AAC C-3′ and 5′-AAG GCG CGC CCT ACT CGT CAT CCT CCT CCT CTT-C-3′ with NotI and AscI sites required for the cloning site at the N terminus of the GFP coding sequence. The second primers were 5′-TAC CCA AGC TTC GAT GGG GAA GGA TCC GAC AAA AC-3′ and 5′-GCG AAT TCC TAC TCG TCA TCC TCC TCC TCT TC-3′ with EcoRI and Hind sites required for the cloning site at the C terminus of GFP. The PCR reaction products were then digested as designed and ligated into Double MCS pEGFP plasmid for the construction of HMGB1-GFP recombinants. The digested products were purified by MinEluted kit (Qiagen) and then ligated by the T4 ligation system (Promega).The HMGB1-GFP fusion protein plasmids were transfected to 293T cells by using the FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). The cells were extracted with the SDS buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 1.8% SDS, 7.75% glycerol, and 4.4% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8), and the extracts were pressed several times through a needle. The extracts were boiled twice for 5 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble material. Samples corresponding to the same wet weight were analyzed by Western blotting. Zebrafish embryos were collected and transferred onto a Petri dish with E3 medium (miniQ water containing 5 mm NaCl, 0.17 mm KCl, 0.33 mm CaCl2, and 0.33 mm MgSO4). The fish were killed by keeping them on ice for more than 10 min followed by decapitation or fixation. Larval fish were fixed whole with 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at room temperature for 2 h or at 4 °C overnight, and brains of 5-dpf larvae were dissected under a stereomicroscope after the fixation (15Kaslin J. Panula P. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 440: 342-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The fixed samples could be saved in phosphate buffer for up to 2 weeks. Whole-mount in situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (17Thisse C. Thisse B. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar) using the specific probes (18Thisse C. Thisse B. High Throughput Expression Analysis of ZF-Models Consortium Clones, ZFIN Direct Data Submission. 2005; Google Scholar) of Pas2a (the ZIRC cb378), Pas6a (ZIRC cb280), and Krox20 (ZIRC cb427). Larvae at 30-hpf (Prim-5) and 48-hpf (Long-pec) stages were used in the experiments. Affinity-purified anti-peptide IV and (against the peptide KFKDPNAPKRPPSA that corresponds to residues 87–100 of the rat HMGB1 sequence) and anti-peptide V (against the peptide KAEKSKKKKEE that corresponds to the residues 176–186 of the rat HMGB1 sequence) have been previously characterized (19Parkkinen J. Raulo E. Merenmies J. Nolo R. Kajander E.O. Baumann M. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19726-19738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were used at the concentration 250 ng/ml to detect the zebrafish and rodent HMGB1 in Western blotting. Binding of the anti-peptide IV antibodies to the zebrafish HMGB1 was verified using cells transfected with the recombinant zebrafish HMGB1-GFP fusion plasmid. Polyclonal anti-β-catenin antibodies (25 ng/ml; C2206 rabbit polyclonal, Sigma) were used to detect β-catenin in Western blotting. Mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (A2228 Sigma, 1:2000) was used as a control of sample loading. For Western blotting, brains from more than 1-year-old adult zebrafish or lysates from 15–20 larvae were homogenized in 80 μl of SDS gel sample buffer (16Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio). 4th Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR2000Google Scholar); 15 μl of cell or tissue lysate was used for SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to HybondTM nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by a semidry blotting technique with transblotting cell (Bio-Rad) and detected with the antibodies as described (16Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio). 4th Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR2000Google Scholar). After the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody incubation, the samples were visualized with the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Mouse monoclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibody (Diasorin, Stillwater, MN) was used for the whole-mount staining of the catecholaminergic system in 5-dpf larval brains as descried earlier (15Kaslin J. Panula P. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 440: 342-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-HMGB1 peptide antibodies (see above, 250 ng/ml), chicken anti-AMIGO1 antibodies (1 μg/ml), and anti-active-β-catenin antibodies (mouse monoclonal, Millipore; the antibody epitope is 100% conserved in zebrafish; 1.1000) were used for whole-mount immunostaining of zebrafish larvae. The anti-AMIGO1 antibodies were generated against the AMIGO1 extracellular domain (20Kuja-Panula J. Kiiltomäki M. Yamashiro T. Rouhiainen A. Rauvala H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) using a GST-tagged zebrafish fusion protein as the antigen and affinity-purified with AMIGO1 extracellular domain-maltose affinity column. Specificity was shown by Western blotting and competition of binding to the 3 dpf larval samples by the AMIGO1 ectodomain. For immunohistochemistry of the larvae, the samples were washed and preincubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 or 0.25% Triton X-100 (PBS-T, pH 7.4) with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 4% natural goat serum at 4 °C overnight or longer. The specimens were incubated with the primary antibodies in the preincubation solution (PBS-T with 2% natural goat serum) for 1–3 days at 4 °C under slow stirring. The samples were then washed thoroughly with PBS-T and incubated with the Alexa®-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Alexa 546), goat anti-chicken (Alexa 488), or goat anti-mouse (Alexa 568) secondary antibodies (diluted 1:2000) in the preincubation solution for 1–2 days at 4 °C. The samples were washed with PBS-T twice for 30 min, once with PBS for 30 min, and once with 50% glycerol in PBS for 1 h, and the samples were then infiltrated overnight in 80% glycerol in PBS before mounting. HMGB1 knockdown experiments were carried out with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) (Gene Tools) targeted to 5′ upstream sequences flanking the translation start site (MO1, 5′-CCT TCC CCA TCT TTG CCT AAA TAT C-3′) and to RNA splicing sites between the 3rd and 4th exons (MO2, 5′-AAC TGA TTT TCT CAC CTT CTC GTA C-3′; MO3, 5′-GCG ATG TCC TGA AAT AAG ATA TTC G-3′) of the Hmgb1 transcript. The Hmgb1 five mispaired MOs, corresponding to the sequence of MO1 but with five non-pairing nucleotides (5mis MO, CgT TCg CCA TgT TTc CCT AAt TAT C; the non-pairing nucleotides marked by lowercase letters), was used as a morpholino oligo injection control. Because a variety of MOs have the potential of inducing neural apoptosis caused by their off-targeting effects inducing the p53 apoptosis pathway, coinjection of p53 MO (21Robu M.E. Larson J.D. Nasevicius A. Beiraghi S. Brenner C. Farber S.A. Ekker S.C. PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: 787-801Crossref Scopus (825) Google Scholar) with each HMGB1 MO was separately carried out to investigate whether the HMGB1 morphant phenotype can be rescued by p53 knockdown. Each HMGB1 MO was mixed with 4 ng of p53 MO to carry out microinjection. The transcription level of p53 in both single MO-injected and mixed MO-injected 2-dpf embryos was detected by quantitative RT-PCR with the primers reported (21Robu M.E. Larson J.D. Nasevicius A. Beiraghi S. Brenner C. Farber S.A. Ekker S.C. PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: 787-801Crossref Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The primers 5′-TAC CCA AGC TTC GAT GGG GAA GGA TCC GAC AAA AC-3′ and 5′-GCG AAT TCC TAC TCG TCA TCC TCC TCC TCT TC-3′ were used for adding EcoRI and HindI restriction enzyme digestion sites on both sides of the Hmgb1 first-strand cDNA. The primers 5′-ATA AGA TCT ATG CCC CCT TCC ATT AAT TG-3′ and 5′-AAG AAT TCC CGG TCA AAA GAT ACA CAT CCT C-3′ were used for adding BglΠ and EcoRI restriction enzyme digestion sites on both sides of the AMIGO1 first-strand cDNA. These restriction sites are required for insertion into the pMC expression vector, which caps the inserted fragment with the sequence elements of the β-globin 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR on both sides separately and SV40 poly(A) signal at the 3′ tail additionally. This elevates the transcribed cRNA stability and activity about 100-fold in cRNA injection experiments (22Fink M. Flekna G. Ludwig A. Heimbucher T. Czerny T. Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 3370-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). GFP cRNA was used as a control in cRNA rescue experiments, and it was prepared using pEGFP-C1 vector. All cRNAs were prepared using mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All MO aliquots were stored at 300 μm dilution in sterile distilled water at −70 °C. Capped Hmgb1 cRNA was stored at 1 μg/μl in sterile distilled water at −70 °C. For HMGB1 knockdown experiments, the injection solution containing 25% phenyl red with 50 μm HMGB1 MO1 or 100 μm concentrations of the other MOs (the concentration was varied in dosage experiments) was prepared and heated at 65 °C for 15min. The mixture was then cooled down at room temperature. An aliquot of 4 nl of the mixture (corresponding to 2 ng of MO1 and 4 ng of the other MOs when 50 or 100 μm solution was used correspondingly) was injected into the yolk of a 1–4-cell embryo that was allowed to develop at 28.5 °C. For cRNA rescue experiments, 0.1 μg/μl cRNA was mixed with MO injection solution after the heating. All injections were done with an injector (WPI PV830 Pneumatic Pico Pump) and a micromanipulator (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). Whole-mount staining of 28-hpf larval apoptosis was performed using the DeadEndTM Fluorometric TUNEL system (Promega (23Blin M. Norton W. Bally-Cuif L. Vernier P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2008; 39: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)), and whole-mount staining of 80-hpf larval cell proliferation was studied with Click-iT Edu Alexa® Fluor 555 imaging kit (Invitrogen) using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Unlike assays using bromodeoxyuridine, Click-iT® EdU assays are not antibody-based and, therefore, do not require DNA denaturation for detection of the incorporated nucleoside. Instead, Click-iT® EdU utilizes click chemistry for detection in a variety of Alexa Fluor® dye fluorescent readouts. (Invitrogen, #C10338). Confocal imaging of 5-dpf brains stained with anti-TH antibodies was carried out as described (24Sallinen V. Torkko V. Sundvik M. Reenilä I. Khrustalyov D. Kaslin J. Panula P. J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Zeiss LSM5 Pascal confocal microscopy system with air (10× dry) and water immersion objectives (high magnification, 25 or 63×) was used for imaging of 28-hpf larvae stained with anti-AMIGO1 and anti-HMGB1 antibodies. The fluorophores were excited with the 488- or 568-nm lines from an argon-krypton laser (Omnichrome; Melles Griot, Carlsbad, CA). Cross-talk between the channels and background noise was eliminated with sequential scanning and frame averaging as described earlier (15Kaslin J. Panula P. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 440: 342-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Stacks of images taken at 1–1.2-μm intervals were compiled to make maximum intensity projection images. For each scan, uninjected larval samples were scanned first for imaging normalization. All morphants were then scanned using the same experimental details. Specimens for light microscopy were examined with inverted light microscopy using Olympus IX 70 connected through a CCD camera to the Analysis® software. High resolution whole-mount in situ images were obtained with a digital MicroFire S99808 camera (Optronics) attached to an Olympus BX51 epifluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The acquired images were further processed with Adobe Photoshop 8.0 software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Anatomical structures of larval brain were named and numbered using the neuroanatomical atlas of adult zebrafish brain (25Mueller T. Wullimann M.F. Atlas of Early Zebrafish Brain Development: A Tool for Molecular Neurogenetics. Elsevier, Amsterdam2005: 29-120Google Scholar, 26Rink E. Wullimann M.F. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2002; 137: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and the atlas based on location of TH neurons in 5-dpf larval fish (14Chen Y.C. Priyadarshini M. Panula P. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 132: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Sallinen V. Torkko V. Sundvik M. Reenilä I. Khrustalyov D. Kaslin J. Panula P. J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All statistical analyses were carried out using OriginPro 7.5. Intensities of the Western blot bands were examined with Quantityone 4.6.2 (Bio-Rad) software. HMGB1 protein sequence alignments of different species (Ensembl) and statistical analysis were carried out using Geneious pro trial 4.8.2 (Biomatters Ltd.). The zebrafish Hmgb1 gene has the same exon-intron organization (supplemental Fig. S2) as the mammalian Hmgb1. The full-length zebrafish Hmgb1 DNA was cloned by using mRNA from zebrafish larvae and primers designed according to the putative homologous sequence found in the Zv8 data base (Ensembl, search Danio rerio). Blast searches identified Hmgb1 as the closest homologue within the mammalian sequences. Comparisons of the deduced amino acid sequence (supplemental Fig. S1) to the human or mouse HMGB1 and HMGB2 sequences displayed 86 and 78% similarity, respectively. As in mammals, the zebrafish sequence corresponds to the protein having two homologous HMG boxes (HMG boxes A and B) followed by the acidic tail consisting of only glutamate and aspartate residues (Fig. 1A). The deduced amino acid sequence is slightly shorter (205 amino acids) than the mammalian one (214 amino acids). We have previously produced a series of affinity-purified anti-protein and anti-synthetic peptide antibodies that detect the mammalian HMGB1 (19Parkkinen J. Raulo E. Merenmies J. Nolo R. Kajander E.O. Baumann M. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19726-19738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against a synthetic peptide (anti-peptide IV; see Ref. 19Parkkinen J. Raulo E. Merenmies J. Nolo R. Kajander E.O. Baumann M. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19726-19738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) corresponding to a highly conserved area immediately before and at the beginning of the B box (Fig. 1, A and B) were found to bind to the zebrafish HMGB1 in Western blotting. These antibodies detected the endogenously occurring HMGB1 of zebrafish brain lysate and of the cells used in transfection assays (the 28-kDa band in Fig. 1B). Furthermore, in transfection assays these anti-HMGB1 antibodies detected the zebrafish and rat fusion protein in a similar manner (the 55-kDa band in Fig. 1B). In contrast, antibodies against a sequence closer to the C-terminal end (anti-peptide V), where the zebrafish and the mammalian sequences display many differences, only detected the endogenously occurring HMGB1 of the cells used for transfection assays (the 28-kDa band in Fig. 1B) and the rat fusion protein (the 55-kDa band in Fig. 1B) but not the endogenously occurring zebrafish protein or the zebrafish fusion protein. Further evidence of the specificity of the antibodies (anti-peptide IV) is provided by the reduced or lacking detection of the zebrafish 28-kDa protein when translation or mRNA synthesis is disturbed in the morpholino antisense experiments specifically targeting HMGB1 (see e.g. the Western blots in Fig. 2). Gene-specific antisense MOs have been widely used to inhibit gene expression in zebrafish larvae (27Eisen J.S. S"
https://openalex.org/W2067423716,"The CDKN2A/ARF locus encompasses overlapping tumor suppressor genes p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF), which are frequently co-deleted in human malignant mesothelioma (MM). The importance of p16(INK4A) loss in human cancer is well established, but the relative significance of p14(ARF) loss has been debated. The tumor predisposition of mice singly deficient for either Ink4a or Arf, due to targeting of exons 1α or 1β, respectively, supports the idea that both play significant and nonredundant roles in suppressing spontaneous tumors. To further test this notion, we exposed Ink4a(+/−) and Arf(+/−) mice to asbestos, the major cause of MM. Asbestos-treated Ink4a(+/−) and Arf(+/−) mice showed increased incidence and shorter latency of MM relative to wild-type littermates. MMs from Ink4a(+/−) mice exhibited biallelic inactivation of Ink4a, loss of Arf or p53 expression and frequent loss of p15(Ink4b). In contrast, MMs from Arf(+/−) mice exhibited loss of Arf expression, but did not require loss of Ink4a or Ink4b. Mice doubly deficient for Ink4a and Arf, due to deletion of Cdkn2a/Arf exon 2, showed accelerated asbestos-induced MM formation relative to mice deficient for Ink4a or Arf alone, and MMs exhibited biallelic loss of both tumor suppressor genes. The tumor suppressor function of Arf in MM was p53-independent, since MMs with loss of Arf retained functional p53. Collectively, these in vivo data indicate that both CDKN2A/ARF gene products suppress asbestos carcinogenicity. Furthermore, while inactivation of Arf appears to be crucial for MM pathogenesis, the inactivation of both p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) cooperate to accelerate asbestos-induced tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2007525399,"The activation of complement during platelet activation is incompletely understood.We sought to explore the formation of C5b-9 and anaphylatoxins binding to collagen-activated platelets.C5b-9, anaphylatoxins C3a, C4a and C5a, and anaphylatoxin receptors C3aR1 and C5aR were measured by flow cytometry and/or confocal microscopy. Platelet microparticles were quantified by flow cytometry, and their C5b-9 content was determined by western blot analyses. In all experiments, sodium citrate was used for blood anticoagulation.C5b-9 rapidly formed on the platelet surface following activation with collagen, TRAP, ADP or A23187, but was surprisingly restricted to a subset of platelets (1 to 15%) independently of P-selectin or phosphatidylserine exposure. Following collagen activation, C5b-9-positive platelets in thrombi were found associated with collagen fibres. C5b-9 formation was obliterated by Mg(2+)-EGTA and significantly reduced by the thrombin inhibitor hirudin (-37%, p<0.05), but was unaffected by chondroitinase, compstatin, SCH79797 (PAR-1 inhibitor), or in the PRP of a MBL-deficient donor. Compstatin and Mg(2+)-EGTA, but not hirudin, SCH79797 or chondroitinase, inhibited the formation of collagen-induced microparticles (-71% and -44%, respectively, p<0.04). These microparticles contained greater amounts of C5b-9 compared with the other agonists. Platelet activation by collagen or convulxin resulted in the strong binding of anaphylatoxins and the exposure of receptors C3aR1 and C5aR (CD88) on their surface.C5b-9 formation on collagen-activated platelets is i) partially controlled by thrombin, ii) restricted to a subset of platelets, and iii) can occur without P-selectin expression or phosphatidylserine exposure. Activated platelets bind anaphylatoxins on their surface and express C3a and C5a receptors, which may contribute to the localization of inflammatory processes during thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W2094168481,"Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the common pathological basis of irreversible visual impairment encountered in a variety of chorioretinal diseases; the pathogenesis of its development is complicated and still imperfectly understood. Recent studies indicated that delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4), one of the Notch family ligands might participate in the HIF-1α-VEGF pathway to regulate CNV angiogenesis. But little is known about the influence and potential mechanism of Dll4/Notch signals on CNV angiogenesis. Real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting were used to analyze the expression alteration of Dll4, VEGF and HIF-1α in hypoxic RF/6A cells. Immunofluorescence staining, a laser-induced rat CNV model and intravitreal injection techniques were used to confirm the relationships among these molecules in vitro and in vivo. RPE-RF/6A cell co-culture systems were used to investigate the effects of Dll4/Notch signals on CNV angiogenesis. We found that the Dll4 was involved in hypoxia signaling in CNV angiogenesis. Results from the co-culture system showed that the enhancement of Dll4 expression in RF/6A cells led to the significantly faster proliferation and stronger tube forming ability, but inhibited cells migration and invasion across a monolayer of RPE cells in hypoxic environment, while siRNA-mediated Dll4 silencing caused the opposite effects. Pharmacological disruption of Notch signaling using gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) produced similar, but not identical effects, to that caused by the Dll4 siRNA. In addition, the expression of several key molecules involved in the angiogenesis of CNV was altered in RF/6A cells showing constitutively active Dll4 expression. These results suggest that Dll4 play an important role in CNV angiogenesis, which appears to be regulated by HIF-1α and VEGF during the progression of CNV under hypoxic conditions. Targeting Dll4/Notch signaling may facilitate further understanding of the mechanisms that underlie CNV angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2141657846,"Our previous work shows that the stem cell factor SALL4 plays a central role in embryonic and leukemic stem cells. In this study, we report that SALL4 expression was higher in drug resistant primary acute myeloid leukemic patients than those from drug-responsive cases. In addition, while overexpression of SALL4 led to drug resistance in cell lines, cells with decreased SALL4 expression were more sensitive to drug treatments than the parental cells. This led to our investigation of the implication of SALL4 in drug resistance and its role in side population (SP) cancer stem cells. SALL4 expression was higher in SP cells compared to non-SP cells by 2–4 fold in various malignant hematopoietic cell lines. Knocking down of SALL4 in isolated SP cells resulted in a reduction of SP cells, indicating that SALL4 is required for their self-renewal. The SP phenotype is known to be mediated by members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug transport protein family, such as ABCG2 and ABCA3. Using chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP), quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay(EMSA), we demonstrated that SALL4 was able to bind to the promoter region of ABCA3 and activate its expression while regulating the expression of ABCG2 indirectly. Furthermore, SALL4 expression was positively correlated to those of ABCG2 and ABCA3 in primary leukemic patient samples. Taken together, our results suggest a novel role for SALL4 in drug sensitivity, at least in part through the maintenance of SP cells, and therefore may be responsible for drug-resistance in leukemia. We are the first to demonstrate a direct link between stem cell factor SALL4, SP and drug resistance in leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2072016977,"The self-association of proteins into amyloid fibrils offers an alternative to the natively folded state of many polypeptides. Although commonly associated with disease, amyloid fibrils represent the natural functional state of some proteins, such as the chaplins from the soil-dwelling bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor, which coat the aerial mycelium and spores rendering them hydrophobic. We have undertaken a biophysical characterisation of the five short chaplin peptides ChpD-H to probe the mechanism by which these peptides self-assemble in solution to form fibrils. Each of the five chaplin peptides produced synthetically or isolated from the cell wall is individually surface-active and capable of forming fibrils under a range of solution conditions in vitro. These fibrils contain a highly similar cross-β core structure and a secondary structure that resembles fibrils formed in vivo on the spore and mycelium surface. They can also restore the growth of aerial hyphae to a chaplin mutant strain. We show that cysteine residues are not required for fibril formation in vitro and propose a role for the cysteine residues conserved in four of the five short chaplin peptides."

Each monomer is composed of 20 protein subunits, chlorophylls, carotenoids, and redox-active plastoquinones (2Guskov A. Kern J. Gabdulkhakov A. Broser M. Zouni A. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 3Umena Y. Kawakami K. Shen J.R. Kamiya N. Nature. 2011; 473: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2947) Google Scholar). Calcium and chloride are required for activity under physiological conditions (4Yocum C.F. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2008; 252: 296-305Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The chloride binding site has been assigned near the active site (2Guskov A. Kern J. Gabdulkhakov A. Broser M. Zouni A. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 3Umena Y. Kawakami K. Shen J.R. Kamiya N. Nature. 2011; 473: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2947) Google Scholar).The D1, D2, CP43, and CP47 polypeptides form the intrinsic core complex of PSII. The D1 and D2 membrane spanning proteins bind the electron transfer cofactors active in water oxidation (2Guskov A. Kern J. Gabdulkhakov A. Broser M. Zouni A. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 3Umena Y. Kawakami K. Shen J.R. Kamiya N. Nature. 2011; 473: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2947) Google Scholar). This central heterodimeric core is symmetrically flanked by the CP43 and CP47 proteins, which bind light-harvesting antennae chlorophyll (Chl) molecules (5Bricker T.M. Frankel L.K. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 72: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Each of these core polypeptides is composed of intrinsic membrane-spanning helices, as well as several hydrophilic loops that protrude into the interior lumen of the thylakoid membrane (2Guskov A. Kern J. Gabdulkhakov A. Broser M. Zouni A. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 3Umena Y. Kawakami K. Shen J.R. Kamiya N. Nature. 2011; 473: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2947) Google Scholar). The lumenal loop regions of CP43 have been implicated as important in assembly and protection from photoinhibition (see Ref. 5Bricker T.M. Frankel L.K. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 72: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar and references therein).The active site of water oxidation, the Mn4Ca cluster, is located on the lumenal surface and is protected by three extrinsic polypeptides (6Miyao M. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 315-321Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In plants, these extrinsic proteins, the 18-kDa, 24-kDa, and psbO (or the 33-kDa, manganese stabilizing protein), are essential for maximal oxygen evolution under physiological conditions (6Miyao M. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 315-321Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Both cyanobacterial and plant PSII contain an intrinsic cytochrome b559 (7MacDonald G.M. Boerner R.J. Everly R.M. Cramer W.A. Debus R.J. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4393-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas cyanobacterial PSII also contains an extrinsic cytochrome c550 (2Guskov A. Kern J. Gabdulkhakov A.

The structure of cyanobacterial PSII has been solved to 1.9-Å resolution (Ref. 3Umena Y. Kawakami K. Shen J.R. Kamiya N.

Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). In contrast, the resolution of a plant PSII structure remains at 8-Å resolution (12Rhee K.H. Morris E.P. Barber J. Kühlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 396: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar).Given its structural and functional complexity, many aspects of PSII function remain elusive. In particular, the roles of post-translational modifications (PTMs) of amino acid side chains are not thoroughly understood. The biological relevance of PTMs is evident in their wide range of functions, including roles in cellular regulation (13Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 14Stadtman E.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6323-6331Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and catalysis (15Janes S.M. Mu D. Wemmer D. Smith A.J. Kaur S. Maltby D. Burlingame A.L. Klinman J.P. Science. 1990; 248: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Modifications of the intrinsic subunits of PSII have been described previously (16Whitelegge J.P. Faull K.F. Gundersen C.B. Gómez S.M. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For example, in the D1 subunit, the N-terminal methionine is removed, the N-terminal amino acid is acylated, and the carboxyl terminus is processed by a specific lumenal protease, CtpA (18Bowyer J.R.

Diner B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In CP43, 14 amino acids are cleaved from the N terminus, which is then N-acetylated. In D2 and CP47, amino-terminal residues are removed, and the subunits are also N-acetylated. In addition, in a PSII reaction center preparation, in which CP47 and CP43 have been removed with chaotropes, a susceptibility to oxidation of D1/D2 has been reported (20Sharma J. Panico M. Shipton C.A. Nilsson F. Morris H.R. Barber J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33158-33166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A proteomics-based study of Arabidopsis has shown a increased prevalence of oxidative modifications under high light stress (21Galetskiy D. Lohscheider J.N. Kononikhin A.S. Popov I.A. Nikolaev E.N. Adamska I. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2011; 25: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Despite improvements in PSII structure resolution, detection of PTMs based on available x-ray structures is not yet possible.Other PTMs of PSII proteins have been identified, including oxidation of tryptophan to kynurenine (Fig. 1A) (22Anderson L.B.

Photosynth. Res. 2002; 74: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Core PSII subunits contain multiple unidentified PTM residues that covalently bind amines (23Anderson L.B. Ouellette A.J.

These reactions were attributed to reactive, carbonyl-containing amino acid side chains close to the active site, and covalent binding was proposed to occur via a Schiff base complex. The addition of chloride was observed to inhibit amine binding, suggesting that the binding sites were near the water oxidizing complex (28Sandusky P.O. Yocum C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 603-611Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Sandusky P.O. Yocum C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 849: 85-93Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Importantly, amines are well known inhibitors of photosynthetic water oxidation (28Sandusky P.O. Yocum C.F. Biochim. Biophys.

These experiments imply that the amine-binding residues may play a role in the structure, function, or assembly of PSII.In addition to kynurenine, another known PTM of tryptophan in proteins is N-formylkynurenine (NFK). NFK may bind amines and is created as a stable double oxidation intermediate in the formation of kynurenine (Fig. 1A) (21Galetskiy D. Lohscheider J.N. Kononikhin A.S. Popov I.A. Nikolaev E.N.

Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 2327-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this work, we use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and UV resonance Raman (UVRR) to show that PSII contains NFK. The unique ∼325 nm absorption band of NFK was employed in the purification of NFK-containing CP43 peptides. By MS/MS peptide sequencing, NFK was identified as a +32 m/z modification of Trp-365 in CP43. A vibrational band at 1044 cm−1 was observed, which is a characteristic of the oxidized indole ring in NFK. Quantitative analysis of the HPLC chromatogram was compared with the amount of inhibition under high light conditions. This comparison suggests that the CP43 NFK modification can be induced by high light stress in PSII membrane preparations. IntroductionOxygenic photosynthesis is the enzyme-catalyzed conversion of light energy to biochemical energy, and this process occurs in the membranes of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. In oxygenic photosynthesis, photosystem II (PSII) 4The abbreviations used are: PSIIphotosystem IIB5A5-(biotinamido)-pentylamineChlchlorophyllNFKN-formylkynureninePTMpost-translational modificationROSreactive oxygen speciesTFAtrifluoroacetic acidUVRRultraviolet resonance Raman. catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of water and reduction of plastoquinone. On the acceptor side of PSII, electrons are transferred sequentially to two quinone molecules, QA and QB (1Nelson N. Yocum C.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 521-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). On the donor side, a Mn4Ca active site is the binding site for water and the site of oxygen production. Each monomer is composed of 20 protein subunits, chlorophylls, carotenoids, and redox-active plastoquinones (2Guskov A. Kern J. Gabdulkhakov A. Broser M. Zouni A. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Calcium and chloride are required for activity under physiological conditions (4Yocum C.F. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2008; 252: 296-305Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The chloride binding site has been assigned near the active site (2Guskov A. Kern J. Gabdulkhakov A. Broser M. Zouni A. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Each of these core polypeptides is composed of intrinsic membrane-spanning helices, as well as several hydrophilic loops that protrude into the interior lumen of the thylakoid membrane (2Guskov A.

These experiments imply that the amine-binding residues may play a role in the structure, function, or assembly of PSII.In addition to kynurenine, another known PTM of tryptophan in proteins is N-formylkynurenine (NFK). NFK may bind amines and is created as a stable double oxidation intermediate in the formation of kynurenine (Fig. 1A) (21Galetskiy D. Lohscheider J.N. Kononikhin A.S. Popov I.A. Nikolaev E.N.

Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 2327-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this work, we use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and UV resonance Raman (UVRR) to show that PSII contains NFK. The unique ∼325 nm absorption band of NFK was employed in the purification of NFK-containing CP43 peptides. By MS/MS peptide sequencing, NFK was identified as a +32 m/z modification of Trp-365 in CP43. A vibrational band at 1044 cm−1 was observed, which is a characteristic of the oxidized indole ring in NFK. Quantitative analysis of the HPLC chromatogram was compared with the amount of inhibition under high light conditions. This comparison suggests that the CP43 NFK modification can be induced by high light stress in PSII membrane preparations. Oxygenic photosynthesis is the enzyme-catalyzed conversion of light energy to biochemical energy, and this process occurs in the membranes of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. In oxygenic photosynthesis, photosystem II (PSII) 4The abbreviations used are: PSIIphotosystem IIB5A5-(biotinamido)-pentylamineChlchlorophyllNFKN-formylkynureninePTMpost-translational modificationROSreactive oxygen speciesTFAtrifluoroacetic acidUVRRultraviolet resonance Raman. catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of water and reduction of plastoquinone. On the acceptor side of PSII, electrons are transferred sequentially to two quinone molecules, QA and QB (1Nelson N. Yocum C.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 521-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). On the donor side, a Mn4Ca active site is the binding site for water and the site of oxygen production. Each monomer is composed of 20 protein subunits, chlorophylls, carotenoids, and redox-active plastoquinones (2Guskov A. Kern J. Gabdulkhakov A. Broser M. Zouni A. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Mol.

The D1, D2, CP43, and CP47 polypeptides form the intrinsic core complex of PSII. The D1 and D2 membrane spanning proteins bind the electron transfer cofactors active in water oxidation (2Guskov A.

This central heterodimeric core is symmetrically flanked by the CP43 and CP47 proteins, which bind light-harvesting antennae chlorophyll (Chl) molecules (5Bricker T.M. Frankel L.K. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 72: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Each of these core polypeptides is composed of intrinsic membrane-spanning helices, as well as several hydrophilic loops that protrude into the interior lumen of the thylakoid membrane (2Guskov A.

The lumenal loop regions of CP43 have been implicated as important in assembly and protection from photoinhibition (see Ref. 5Bricker T.M. Frankel L.K. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 72: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar and references therein). The active site of water oxidation, the Mn4Ca cluster, is located on the lumenal surface and is protected by three extrinsic polypeptides (6Miyao M. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 315-321Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In plants, these extrinsic proteins, the 18-kDa, 24-kDa, and psbO (or the 33-kDa, manganese stabilizing protein), are essential for maximal oxygen evolution under physiological conditions (6Miyao M. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 315-321Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Both cyanobacterial and plant PSII contain an intrinsic cytochrome b559 (7MacDonald G.M. Boerner R.J.

Nature. 1998; 396: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Given its structural and functional complexity, many aspects of PSII function remain elusive. In particular, the roles of post-translational modifications (PTMs) of amino acid side chains are not thoroughly understood. The biological relevance of PTMs is evident in their wide range of functions, including roles in cellular regulation (13Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys.

In D2 and CP47, amino-terminal residues are removed, and the subunits are also N-acetylated. In addition, in a PSII reaction center preparation, in which CP47 and CP43 have been removed with chaotropes, a susceptibility to oxidation of D1/D2 has been reported (20Sharma J. Panico M.

These reactions were attributed to reactive, carbonyl-containing amino acid side chains close to the active site, and covalent binding was proposed to occur via a Schiff base complex.

They, therefore, could also be associated with differences of in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes, reported between races/ethnicities. We analyzed 339 consecutive IVF patients, 232 Caucasian, 59 African and 48 Asian, for FMR1 genotypes, and tested by multiple logistic regressions for associations between race/ethnicity, FMR1 genotype, autoimmunity and pregnancy chances with IVF. FMR1 genotypes were predictive of pregnancy (P = 0.046), het-norm/low most significantly and with decreasing chance in comparison to norm genotypes (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.23-0.85; P = 0.014). Race/ethnicity was, overall, independently associated (P = 0.03), African demonstrating decreased odds in comparison to Caucasian (OR 0.33. 95%CI 0.13-0.79; P = 0.014). Autoimmunity did not differ but interaction of autoimmunity with FMR1 genotype almost reached significance (P = 0.07). Logistic regression with race/ethnicity and interaction between FMR1 genotype and autoimmunity in the model, demonstrated 2.5-times the odds of being associated with autoimmune positivity (OR 2.5, 1.34-4.55; P = 0.004).

https://openalex.org/W2016893298,"The resting membrane potential of the pacemaker neurons is one of the essential mechanisms underlying rhythm generation. In this study, we described the biophysical properties of an uncharacterized channel (U-type channel) and investigated the role of the channel in the rhythmic activity of a respiratory pacemaker neuron and the respiratory behaviour in adult freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Our results show that the channel conducts an inward leak current carried by Na(+) (I(Leak-Na)). The I(Leak-Na) contributed to the resting membrane potential and was required for maintaining rhythmic action potential bursting activity of the identified pacemaker RPeD1 neurons. Partial knockdown of the U-type channel suppressed the aerial respiratory behaviour of the adult snail in vivo. These findings identified the Na(+) leak conductance via the U-type channel, likely a NALCN-like channel, as one of the fundamental mechanisms regulating rhythm activity of pacemaker neurons and respiratory behaviour in adult animals."
https://openalex.org/W2157341802,"The immune system is a complex collection of interrelated and overlapping solutions to the problem of disease. To deal with this complexity, researchers have devised multiple ways to measure immune function and to analyze the resulting data. In this way both organisms and researchers employ many tactics to solve a complex problem. One challenge facing ecological immunologists is the question of how these many dimensions of immune function can be synthesized to facilitate meaningful interpretations and conclusions. We tackle this challenge by employing and comparing several statistical methods, which we used to test assumptions about how multiple aspects of immune function are related at different organizational levels. We analyzed three distinct datasets that characterized 1) species, 2) subspecies, and 3) among- and within-individual level differences in the relationships among multiple immune indices. Specifically, we used common principal components analysis (CPCA) and two simpler approaches, pair-wise correlations and correlation circles. We also provide a simple example of how these techniques could be used to analyze data from multiple studies. Our findings lead to several general conclusions. First, relationships among indices of immune function may be consistent among some organizational groups (e.g. months over the annual cycle) but not others (e.g. species); therefore any assumption of consistency requires testing before further analyses. Second, simple statistical techniques used in conjunction with more complex multivariate methods give a clearer and more robust picture of immune function than using complex statistics alone. Moreover, these simpler approaches have potential for analyzing comparable data from multiple studies, especially as the field of ecological immunology moves towards greater methodological standardization."
https://openalex.org/W1989773342,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide aggregation is known to play a central role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among various aggregates, low-molecular weight soluble oligomers of Aβ are increasingly believed to be the primary neurotoxic agents responsible for memory impairment. Anionic interfaces are known to influence the Aβ aggregation process significantly. Here, we report the effects of interfaces formed by medium-chain (C9-C12), saturated non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) on Aβ42 aggregation. NEFAs uniquely affected Aβ42 aggregation rates that depended on both the ratio of Aβ:NEFA as well the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the NEFAs. More importantly, irrespective of the kind of NEFA used, we observed that two distinct oligomers, 12-18 mers and 4-5 mers were formed via different pathway of aggregation under specific experimental conditions: (i) 12-18 mers were generated near the CMC in which NEFAs augment the rate of Aβ42 aggregation towards fibril formation, and, (ii) 4-5 mers were formed above the CMC, where NEFAs inhibit fibril formation. The data indicated that both 12-18 mers and 4-5 mers are formed along an alternate pathway called 'off-pathway' that did not result in fibril formation and yet have subtle structural and morphological differences that distinguish their bulk molecular behavior. These observations, (i) reflect the possible mechanism of Aβ aggregation in physiological lipid-rich environments, and (ii) reiterate the fact that all oligomeric forms of Aβ need not be obligatory intermediates of the fibril formation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1964609270,"In the vertebrate embryo, the kidney is derived from the intermediate mesoderm. The LIM-class homeobox transcription factor lhx1 is expressed early in the intermediate mesoderm and is one of the first genes to be expressed in the nephric mesenchyme. In this study, we investigated the role of Lhx1 in specification of the kidney field by either overexpressing or depleting lhx1 in Xenopus embryos or depleting lhx1 in an explant culture system. By overexpressing a constitutively-active form of Lhx1, we established its capacity to expand the kidney field during the specification stage of kidney organogenesis. In addition, the ability of Lhx1 to expand the kidney field diminishes as kidney organogenesis transitions to the morphogenesis stage. In a complimentary set of experiments, we determined that embryos depleted of lhx1, show an almost complete loss of the kidney field. Using an explant culture system to induce kidney tissue, we confirmed that expression of genes from both proximal and distal kidney structures is affected by the absence of lhx1. Taken together our results demonstrate an essential role for Lhx1 in driving specification of the entire kidney field from the intermediate mesoderm."
https://openalex.org/W1990476012,"HIV-1 infection has been on the rise in Japan recently, and the main transmission route has changed from blood transmission in the 1980s to homo- and/or hetero-sexual transmission in the 2000s. The lack of early viral samples with clinical information made it difficult to investigate the possible virological changes over time. In this study, we sequenced 142 full-length env genes collected from 16 Japanese subjects infected with HIV-1 in the 1980s and in the 2000s. We examined the diversity change in sequences and potential adaptive evolution of the virus to the host population. We used a codon-based likelihood method under the branch-site and clade models to detect positive selection operating on the virus. The clade model was extended to account for different positive selection pressures in different viral populations. The result showed that the selection pressure was weaker in the 2000s than in the 1980s, indicating that it might have become easier for the HIV to infect a new host and to develop into AIDS now than 20 years ago and that the HIV may be becoming more virulent in the Japanese population. The study provides useful information on the surveillance of HIV infection and highlights the utility of the extended clade models in analysis of virus populations which may be under different selection pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2165476574,"HIV-1 disease progression is associated with persistent immune activation. However, the nature of this association is incompletely understood. Here, we investigated immune activation in the CD4 T cell compartment of chronically HIV-1 infected individuals from Rakai, Uganda. Levels of CD4 T cell activation, assessed as co-expression of PD-1, CD38 and HLA-DR, correlated directly to viral load and inversely to CD4 count. Deeper characterization of these cells indicated an effector memory phenotype with relatively frequent expression of Ki67 despite their PD-1 expression, and levels of these cells were inversely associated with FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. We therefore use the term deregulated effector memory (DEM) cells to describe them. CD4 T cells with a DEM phenotype could be generated by antigen stimulation of recall responses in vitro. Responses against HIV-1 and CMV antigens were enriched among the DEM CD4 T cells in patients, and the diverse Vβ repertoire of DEM CD4 T cells suggested they include diverse antigen-specificities. Furthermore, the levels of DEM CD4 T cells correlated directly to soluble CD14 (sCD14) and IL-6, markers of innate immune activation, in plasma. The size of the activated DEM CD4 T cell subset was predictive of the rate of disease progression, whereas IL-6 was only weakly predictive and sCD14 was not predictive. Taken together, these results are consistent with a model where systemic innate immune activation and chronic antigen stimulation of adaptive T cell responses both play important roles in driving pathological CD4 T cell immune activation in HIV-1 disease."
https://openalex.org/W2073826869,"Tyrolean Grey cattle represent a local breed with a population size of ∼5000 registered cows. In 2003, a previously unknown neurological disorder was recognized in Tyrolean Grey cattle. The clinical signs of the disorder are similar to those of bovine progressive degenerative myeloencephalopathy (weaver syndrome) in Brown Swiss cattle but occur much earlier in life. The neuropathological investigation of an affected calf showed axonal degeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) and femoral nerve. The pedigrees of the affected calves suggested a monogenic autosomal recessive inheritance. We localized the responsible mutation to a 1.9 Mb interval on chromosome 16 by genome-wide association and haplotype mapping. The MFN2 gene located in this interval encodes mitofusin 2, a mitochondrial membrane protein. A heritable human axonal neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-2A2 (CMT2A2), is caused by MFN2 mutations. Therefore, we considered MFN2 a positional and functional candidate gene and performed mutation analysis in affected and control Tyrolean Grey cattle. We did not find any non-synonymous variants. However, we identified a perfectly associated silent SNP in the coding region of exon 20 of the MFN2 gene. This SNP is located within a putative exonic splice enhancer (ESE) and the variant allele leads to partial retention of the entire intron 19 and a premature stop codon in the aberrant MFN2 transcript. Thus we have identified a highly unusual splicing defect, where an exonic single base exchange leads to the retention of the preceding intron.

https://openalex.org/W1975378006,"The yeast general amino acid permease Gap1 is a convenient model for studying the intracellular trafficking of membrane proteins. Present at the plasma membrane when the nitrogen source is poor, it undergoes ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis and degradation upon addition of a good nitrogen source, e.g., ammonium. It comprises 12 transmembrane domains (TM) flanked by cytosol-facing N- and C-terminal tails (NT, CT). The NT of Gap1 contains the acceptor lysines for ubiquitylation and its CT includes a sequence essential to exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).We used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to isolate 64 mutant Gap1 proteins altered in the NT, the CT, or one of the five TM-connecting intracellular loops (L2, -4, -6, -8 and -10). We found 17 mutations (in L2, L8, L10 and CT) impairing Gap1 exit from the ER. Of the 47 mutant proteins reaching the plasma membrane normally, two are unstable and rapidly down-regulated even when the nitrogen source is poor. Six others are totally inactive and another four, altered in a 16-amino-acid sequence in the NT, are resistant to ammonium-induced down-regulation. Finally, a mutation in L6 causes missorting of Gap1 from the secretory pathway to the vacuole. Interestingly, this direct vacuolar sorting seems to be independent of Gap1 ubiquitylation.This study illustrates the importance of multiple intracellular regions of Gap1 in its secretion, transport activity, and down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2062333368,"Background/Aims To explore different definitions of intra-individual variability (IIV) to summarize performance on commonly utilized cognitive tests (Mini Mental State Exam; Clock Drawing Test); compare them and their potential to differentiate clinically-defined populations; and to examine their utility in predicting clinical change in individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Methods Sample statistics were computed from ADNI cohorts with no cognitive diagnosis, a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and a diagnosis of possible or probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nine different definitions of IIV were computed for each sample, and standardized effect sizes (Cohen's d) were computed for each of these definitions in 500 simulated replicates using scores on the Mini Mental State Exam and Clock Drawing Test. IIV was computed based on test items separately (‘within test’ IIV) and the two tests together (‘across test’ IIV). The best performing definition was then used to compute IIV for a third test, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive, and the simulations and effect sizes were again computed. All effect size estimates based on simulated data were compared to those computed based on the total scores in the observed data. Association between total score and IIV summaries of the tests and the Clinician's Dementia Rating were estimated to test the utility of IIV in predicting clinically meaningful changes in the cohorts over 12- and 24-month intervals. Results ES estimates differed substantially depending on the definition of IIV and the test(s) on which IIV was based. IIV (coefficient of variation) summaries of MMSE and Clock-Drawing performed similarly to their total scores, the ADAS total performed better than its IIV summary. Conclusion IIV can be computed within (items) or across (totals) items on commonly-utilized cognitive tests, and may provide a useful additional summary measure of neuropsychological test performance."
https://openalex.org/W1971669909,"Little is known about the prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV among TB suspects in primary health care units in Ethiopia.In the period of February to March, 2009, a cross sectional survey was done in 27 health centers of Addis Ababa to assess the prevalence of TB and HIV among TB suspects who have > = 2 weeks symptoms of TB such as cough, fever and weight loss. Diagnosis of TB and HIV was based on the national guidelines. Information concerning socio-demographic variables and knowledge of the respondents about TB was collected using pretested questionnaire.Of the 545 TB suspects, 506 (92.7%) of them participated in the study. The prevalence of both pulmonary and extra pulmonary TB was 46.0% (233/506). The smear positivity rate among pulmonary TB suspect was 21.3%. Of the TB suspects, 298 (58.9%) of them were tested for HIV and 27.2% (81/298) were HIV seropositive. Fifty percent of the HIV positive TB suspects had TB. TB suspects who had a contact history with a TB patient in the family were 9 times more likely to have TB than those who did not have a contact history, [OR = 9.1, (95%CI:4.0, 20.5)]. Individuals who had poor [OR = 5.2, (95%CI: 2.3, 11.2)] and fair knowledge [OR = 3.7, (95%CI: 1.3, 10.4)] about TB were more likely to have TB than individuals who had good knowledge.In conclusion, the prevalence of TB among TB suspects with duration of 2 or more weeks is high. Fifty percent of the HIV positive TB suspects had TB. Case finding among TB suspects with duration of 2 or more weeks should be intensified particularly among those who have a contact history with a TB patient."
https://openalex.org/W2151196686,"Epithelial ovarian cancer is an aggressive and deadly disease and understanding its invasion mechanisms is critical for its treatment. We sought to study the penetration/invasion of ovarian tumor cells into extracellular matrices (ECMs) using a fibroblast-derived three-dimensional (3D) culture model and time-lapse and confocal imaging. Twelve ovarian tumor cells were evaluated and classified into distinct groups based on their ECM remodeling phenotypes; those that degraded the ECM (represented by OVCAR5 cells) and those that did not (represented by OVCAR10 cells). Cells exhibiting a distinct ECM modifying behavior were also segregated by epithelial- or mesenchymal-like phenotypes and uPA or MMP-2/MMP-9 expression. The cells, which presented epithelial-like phenotypes, penetrated the ECM using proteases and maintained intact cell-cell interactions, while cells exhibiting mesenchymal phenotypes modified the matrices via Rho-associated serine/threonine kinase (ROCK) in the absence of apparent cell-cell interactions. Overall, this study demonstrates that different mechanisms of modifying matrices by ovarian tumor cells may reflect heterogeneity among tumors and emphasize the need to systematically assess these mechanisms to better design effective therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1968055317,"HCV infection is often associated with B-cell regulatory control disturbance and delayed appearance of neutralizing antibodies. CD81 is a cellular receptor for HCV and can bind to HCV envelope protein 2 (E2). CD81 also participates to form a B cell costimulatory complex. To investigate whether HCV influences B cell activation and immune function through E2 -CD81 engagement, here, human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Raji cells and primary human B lymphocytes (PHB) were treated with HCV E2 protein and cell culture produced HCV particles (HCVcc), and then the related cell phenotypes were assayed. The results showed that both E2 and HCVcc triggered phosphorylation of IκBα, enhanced the expression of anti-apoptosis Bcl-2 family proteins, and protected Raji cells and PHB cells from Fas-mediated death. In addition, both E2 protein and HCVcc increased the expression of costimulatory molecules CD80, CD86 and CD81 itself, and decreased the expression of complement receptor CD21. The effects were dependent on E2-CD81 interaction on the cell surface, since CD81-silenced Raji cells did not respond to both treatments; and an E2 mutant that lose the CD81 binding activity, could not trigger the responses of both Raji cells and PHB cells. The effects were not associated with HCV replication in cells, for HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) and HCVcc failed to infect Raji cells. Hence, E2-CD81 engagement may contribute to HCV-associated B cell lymphoproliferative disorders and insufficient neutralizing antibody production."
https://openalex.org/W1973582553,"Background Cell culture studies show that the antioxidant thiol protein, thioredoxin-1 (Trx1), translocates to cell nuclei during stress, facilitates DNA binding of transcription factors NF-κB and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and potentiates signaling in immune cells. Excessive proinflammatory signaling in vivo contributes to immune hyper-responsiveness and disease severity, but no studies have addressed whether nuclear Trx1 mediates such responses. Methodology/Principal Findings Transgenic mice (Tg) expressing human Trx1 (hTrx1) with added nuclear localization signal (NLS) showed broad tissue expression and nuclear localization. The role of nuclear Trx1 in inflammatory signaling was examined in Tg and wild-type (WT) mice following infection with influenza (H1N1) virus. Results showed that Tg mice had earlier and more extensive NF-κB activation, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression, greater weight loss, slower recovery and increased mortality compared to WT. Decreased plasma glutathione (GSH) and oxidized plasma GSH/GSSG redox potential (EhGSSG) following infection in Tg mice showed that the increased nuclear thiol antioxidant caused a paradoxical downstream oxidative stress. An independent test of this nuclear reductive stress showed that glucocorticoid-induced thymocyte apoptosis was increased by NLS-Trx1. Conclusion/Significance Increased Trx1 in cell nuclei can increase severity of disease responses by potentiation of redox-sensitive transcription factor activation."
https://openalex.org/W2013987795,"To investigate the neural representations of faces in primates, particularly in relation to their personal familiarity or unfamiliarity, neuronal activities were chronically recorded from the ventral portion of the anterior inferior temporal cortex (AITv) of macaque monkeys during the performance of a facial identification task using either personally familiar or unfamiliar faces as stimuli. By calculating the correlation coefficients between neuronal responses to the faces for all possible pairs of faces given in the task and then using the coefficients as neuronal population-based similarity measures between the faces in pairs, we analyzed the similarity/dissimilarity relationship between the faces, which were potentially represented by the activities of a population of the face-responsive neurons recorded in the area AITv. The results showed that, for personally familiar faces, different identities were represented by different patterns of activities of the population of AITv neurons irrespective of the view (e.g., front, 90° left, etc.), while different views were not represented independently of their facial identities, which was consistent with our previous report. In the case of personally unfamiliar faces, the faces possessing different identities but presented in the same frontal view were represented as similar, which contrasts with the results for personally familiar faces. These results, taken together, outline the neuronal representations of personally familiar and unfamiliar faces in the AITv neuronal population."
https://openalex.org/W2075401811,"Cisplatin causes auditory impairment due to the apoptosis of auditory hair cells. There is no strategy to regulate ototoxicity by cisplatin thus far. Dansam-Eum (DSE) has been used for treating the central nerve system injury including hearing loss in Korea. However, disease-related scientific investigation by DSE has not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that DSE and its component rosmarinic acid (RA) were shown to inhibit apoptosis of the primary organ of Corti explants as well as the auditory cells. Administration of DSE and RA reduced the thresholds of the auditory brainstem response in cisplatin-injected mice. A molecular docking simulation and a kinetic assay show that RA controls the activity of caspase-1 by interaction with the active site of caspase-1. Pretreatment of RA inhibited caspase-1 downstream signal pathway, such as the activation of caspase-3 and 9, release of cytochrome c, translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor, up-regulation of Bax, down-regulation of Bcl-2, generation of reactive oxygen species, and activation of nuclear factor-κB. Anticancer activity by cisplatin was not affected by treatment with RA in SNU668, A549, HCT116, and HeLa cells but not B16F10 cells. These findings show that blocking a critical step by RA in apoptosis may be useful strategy to prevent harmful side effects of ototoxicity in patients with having to undergo chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2088626601,"The invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) is established worldwide and displaces native ant species. In northern California, however, the native winter ant (Prenolepis imparis) persists in invaded areas. We found that in aggressive interactions between the two species, P. imparis employs a potent defensive secretion. Field observations were conducted at P. imparis nest sites both in the presence and absence of L. humile. These observations suggested and laboratory assays confirmed that P. imparis workers are more likely to secrete when outnumbered by L. humile. Workers of P. imparis were also more likely to secrete near their nest entrances than when foraging on trees. One-on-one laboratory trials showed that the P. imparis secretion is highly lethal to L. humile, causing 79% mortality. The nonpolar fraction of the secretion was chemically analyzed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and found to be composed of long-chain and cyclic hydrocarbons. Chemical analysis of dissected P. imparis workers showed that the nonpolar fraction is derived from the Dufour's gland. Based on these conclusions, we hypothesize that this chemical defense may help P. imparis to resist displacement by L. humile."
https://openalex.org/W2090122310,"The abundance of diverse biological data from various sources constitutes a rich source of knowledge, which has the power to advance our understanding of organisms. This requires computational methods in order to integrate and exploit these data effectively and elucidate local and genome wide functional connections between protein pairs, thus enabling functional inferences for uncharacterized proteins. These biological data are primarily in the form of sequences, which determine functions, although functional properties of a protein can often be predicted from just the domains it contains. Thus, protein sequences and domains can be used to predict protein pair-wise functional relationships, and thus contribute to the function prediction process of uncharacterized proteins in order to ensure that knowledge is gained from sequencing efforts. In this work, we introduce information-theoretic based approaches to score protein-protein functional interaction pairs predicted from protein sequence similarity and conserved protein signature matches. The proposed schemes are effective for data-driven scoring of connections between protein pairs. We applied these schemes to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteome to produce a homology-based functional network of the organism with a high confidence and coverage. We use the network for predicting functions of uncharacterised proteins.Protein pair-wise functional relationship scores for Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain CDC1551 sequence data and python scripts to compute these scores are available at http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/~gmazandu/scoringschemes."
https://openalex.org/W1976969006,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignancy of the liver, which is closely related to hepatitis C and cirrhosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying the hepatocarcinogenesis induced by HCV infection remain clarified from a standpoint of systems biology. By integrating data from protein-protein interactions, transcriptional regulation, and disease related microarray analysis, we carried out a dynamic biological network analysis on the progression of HCV induced hepatocarcinogenesis, and systematically explored the potentially disease-related mechanisms through a network view. The dysfunctional interactions among proteins and deregulatory relationships between transcription factors and their target genes could be causes for the occurrence and progression of this disease. The six pathologically defined disease stages in the development and progression of HCC after HCV infection were included in this study. We constructed disease-related biological networks for each disease stage, and identified progression-related sub-networks that potentially play roles in the developmental stage of the corresponding disease and participate in the later stage of cancer progression. In addition, we identified novel risk factors related to HCC based on the analysis of the progression-related sub-networks. The dynamic characteristics of the network reflect important features of the disease development and progression, which provide important information for us to further explore underlying mechanisms of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2042394046,"Background Hypersensitive cell death, a form of avirulent pathogen-induced programmed cell death (PCD), is one of the most efficient plant innate immunity. However, its regulatory mechanism is poorly understood. AtLSD1 is an important negative regulator of PCD and only two proteins, AtbZIP10 and AtMC1, have been reported to interact with AtLSD1. Methodology/Principal Findings To identify a novel regulator of hypersensitive cell death, we investigate the possible role of plant LITAF domain protein GILP in hypersensitive cell death. Subcellular localization analysis showed that AtGILP is localized in the plasma membrane and its plasma membrane localization is dependent on its LITAF domain. Yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays demonstrated that AtGILP interacts with AtLSD1. Pull-down assays showed that both the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains of AtGILP are sufficient for interactions with AtLSD1 and that the N-terminal domain of AtLSD1 is involved in the interaction with AtGILP. Real-time PCR analysis showed that AtGILP expression is up-regulated by the avirulent pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 avrRpt2 (Pst avrRpt2) and fumonisin B1 (FB1) that trigger PCD. Compared with wild-type plants, transgenic plants overexpressing AtGILP exhibited significantly less cell death when inoculated with Pst avrRpt2, indicating that AtGILP negatively regulates hypersensitive cell death. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that the LITAF domain protein AtGILP localizes in the plasma membrane, interacts with AtLSD1, and is involved in negatively regulating PCD. We propose that AtGILP functions as a membrane anchor, bringing other regulators of PCD, such as AtLSD1, to the plasma membrane. Human LITAF domain protein may be involved in the regulation of PCD, suggesting the evolutionarily conserved function of LITAF domain proteins in the regulation of PCD."
https://openalex.org/W2095465461,"Prion interactions with soil may play an important role in the transmission of chronic wasting disease (CWD) and scrapie. Prions are known to bind to a wide range of soil surfaces, but the effects of adsorption solution chemistry and long-term soil binding on prion fate and transmission risk are unknown. We investigated HY TME prion protein (PrP(Sc)) adsorption to soil minerals in aqueous solutions of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and deionized water using western blotting. The replication efficiency of bound prions following adsorption in these solutions was also evaluated by protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA). Aging studies investigated PrP(Sc) desorption and replication efficiency up to one year following adsorption in PBS or DI water. Results indicate that adsorption solution chemistry can affect subsequent prion replication or desorption ability, especially after incubation periods of 30 d or longer. Observed effects were minor over the short-term (7 d or less). Results of long-term aging experiments demonstrate that unbound prions or prions bound to a diverse range of soil surfaces can readily replicate after one year. Our results suggest that while prion-soil interactions can vary with solution chemistry, prions bound to soil could remain a risk for transmitting prion diseases after months in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W1978993784,"Ataxin-3, the protein involved in Machado-Joseph disease, is able to bind ubiquitylated substrates and act as a deubiquitylating enzyme in vitro, and it has been involved in the modulation of protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. C. elegans and mouse ataxin-3 knockout models are viable and without any obvious phenotype in a basal condition however their phenotype in stress situations has never been described. Considering the role of ataxin-3 in the protein degradation pathway, we analyzed the effects of heat shock, a known protein homeostasis stressor, in C. elegans ataxin-3 (ATX-3) knockout animals. We found that ATX-3 mutants have an exacerbated stress response and survive significantly better than wild type animals when subjected to a noxious heat shock stimulus. This increased thermotolerance of mutants was further enhanced by pre-exposure to a mild heat shock. At a molecular level, ATX-3 mutants have a distinct transcriptomic and proteomic profile with several molecular chaperones abnormally up-regulated during heat shock and recovery, consistent with the observed resistance phenotype. The improved thermotolerancein ATX-3 mutants is independent of heat shock factor 1, the maestro of the heat shock response, but fully dependent on DAF-16, a critical stress responsive transcription factor involved in longevity and stress resistance. We also show that the increased thermotolerance of ATX-3 mutants is mainly due to HSP-16.2, C12C8.1 and F44E5.5 given that the knockdown of these heat shock proteins using RNA interference causes the phenotype to revert. This report suggests that the absence of ATX-3 activates the DAF-16 pathway leading to an overexpression of molecular chaperones, which yields knockout animals with an improved capacity for dealing with deleterious stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2080601514,"Sudden cardiac death in competitive athletes is rare but it is significantly more frequent than in the normal population. The exact cause is seldom established and is mostly attributed to ventricular fibrillation. Myocardial hypertrophy and slow heart rate, both characteristic changes in top athletes in response to physical conditioning, could be associated with increased propensity for ventricular arrhythmias. We investigated conventional ECG parameters and temporal short-term beat-to-beat variability of repolarization (STV(QT)), a presumptive novel parameter for arrhythmia prediction, in professional soccer players.Five-minute 12-lead electrocardiograms were recorded from professional soccer players (n = 76, all males, age 22.0±0.61 years) and age-matched healthy volunteers who do not participate in competitive sports (n = 76, all males, age 22.0±0.54 years). The ECGs were digitized and evaluated off-line. The temporal instability of beat-to-beat heart rate and repolarization were characterized by the calculation of short-term variability of the RR and QT intervals.Heart rate was significantly lower in professional soccer players at rest (61±1.2 vs. 72±1.5/min in controls). The QT interval was prolonged in players at rest (419±3.1 vs. 390±3.6 in controls, p<0.001). QTc was significantly longer in players compared to controls calculated with Fridericia and Hodges correction formulas. Importantly, STV(QT) was significantly higher in players both at rest and immediately after the game compared to controls (4.8±0.14 and 4.3±0.14 vs. 3.5±0.10 ms, both p<0.001, respectively).STV(QT) is significantly higher in professional soccer players compared to age-matched controls, however, further studies are needed to relate this finding to increased arrhythmia propensity in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2052780653,"To investigate the processing of positive vs. negative feedback in children aged 4-5 years, we devised a prize-guessing game that is analogous to gambling tasks used to measure feedback-related brain responses in adult studies. Unlike adult studies, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) elicited by positive feedback was as large as that elicited by negative feedback, suggesting that the neural system underlying the FRN may not process feedback valence in early childhood. In addition, positive feedback, compared with negative feedback, evoked a larger P1 over the occipital scalp area and a larger positive slow wave (PSW) over the right central-parietal scalp area. We believe that the PSW is related to emotional arousal and the intensive focus on positive feedback that is present in the preschool and early school years has adaptive significance for both cognitive and emotional development during this period."
https://openalex.org/W2015375797,"Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is an entomophagous parasitoid known to be an effective parasitoid of several aphid species of economic importance. A reduction of its production cost during mass rearing for inundative release is needed to improve its use in biological control of pests. In these contexts, a careful analysis of its entire development phases within its host is needed. This paper shows that this parasitoid has some characteristics in its embryological development rather complex and different from most other reported insects, which can be phylogenetically very close. First, its yolkless egg allows a high fecundity of the female but force them to hatch from the egg shell rapidly to the host hemocoel. An early cellularisation allowing a rapid differentiation of a serosa membrane seems to confirm this hypothesis. The serosa wraps the developing embryo until the first instar larva stage and invades the host tissues by microvilli projections and form a placenta like structure able to divert host resources and allowing nutrition and respiration of embryo. Such interspecific invasion, at the cellular level, recalls mammal's trophoblasts that anchors maternal uterine wall and underlines the high adaptation of A. ervi to develop in the host body."
https://openalex.org/W2030321979,"Adverse events upon smallpox vaccination with fully-replicative strains of Vaccinia virus (VACV) comprise an array of clinical manifestations that occur primarily in immunocompromised patients leading to significant host morbidity/mortality. The expansion of immune-suppressed populations and the possible release of Variola virus as a bioterrorist act have given rise to concerns over vaccination complications should more widespread vaccination be reinitiated. Our goal was to evaluate the components of the host immune system that are sufficient to prevent morbidity/mortality in a murine model of tail scarification, which mimics immunological and clinical features of smallpox vaccination in humans. Infection of C57BL/6 wild-type mice led to a strictly localized infection, with complete viral clearance by day 28 p.i. On the other hand, infection of T and B-cell deficient mice (Rag1−/−) produced a severe disease, with uncontrolled viral replication at the inoculation site and dissemination to internal organs. Infection of B-cell deficient animals (µMT) produced no mortality. However, viral clearance in µMT animals was delayed compared to WT animals, with detectable viral titers in tail and internal organs late in infection. Treatment of Rag1−/− with rabbit hyperimmune anti-vaccinia serum had a subtle effect on the morbidity/mortality of this strain, but it was effective in reduce viral titers in ovaries. Finally, NUDE athymic mice showed a similar outcome of infection as Rag1−/−, and passive transfer of WT T cells to Rag1−/− animals proved fully effective in preventing morbidity/mortality. These results strongly suggest that both T and B cells are important in the immune response to primary VACV infection in mice, and that T-cells are required to control the infection at the inoculation site and providing help for B-cells to produce antibodies, which help to prevent viral dissemination. These insights might prove helpful to better identify individuals with higher risk of complications after infection with poxvirus."
https://openalex.org/W2091583781,"Behavioral tactics play a crucial role in the evolution of species and are likely to be found in host-parasitoid interactions where host quality may differ between host developmental stages. We investigated foraging decisions, parasitism and related fitness in a gregarious ectoparasitoid, Sclerodermus harmandi in relation to two distinct host developmental stages: larvae and pupae. Two colonies of parasitoids were reared on larvae of Monochamus alternatus and Saperda populnea (Cerambycidae: Lamiinae). Paired-choice and non-choice experiments were used to evaluate the preference and performance of S. harmandi on larvae and pupae of the two species. Foraging decisions and offspring fitness-related consequences of S. harmandi led to the selection of the most profitable host stage for parasitoid development. Adult females from the two colonies oviposited more quickly on pupae as compared to larvae of M. alternatus. Subsequently, their offspring development time was faster and they gained higher body weight on the pupal hosts. This study demonstrates optimal foraging of intraspecific détente that can occur during host-parasitoid interactions, of which the quality of the parasitism (highest fitness benefit and profitability) is related to the host developmental stage utilized. We conclude that S. harmandi is able to perfectly discriminate among host species or stages in a manner that maximizes its offspring fitness. The results indicated that foraging potential of adults may not be driven by its maternal effects, also induced flexibly with encountering prior host quality."
https://openalex.org/W1996440601,"Background and Objective Inclusion in systematic reviews is one important component in judging the potential impact of clinical studies upon practice and hence the ‘value for money’ of spending for clinical research. This study aims to quantify the distribution of countries of origin of clinical studies used in Cochrane Reviews (CRs), and to link these data to the size of a country and to its spending on research. Methods Random sample of publications used for CRs published in Issue 1 2008 and of publications used in CRs in the field of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Publications without original data were excluded. Likely countries of origin determined based on abstracts/full texts. CIA World Factbook (population data) and OECD database (economic data) were used. Results 1,000 random entries out of 140,005 references available in all specialities. In 876 (91.4%) of 959 eligible studies, country of origin was determined. The USA was the leading contributor (36.0% of the studies), followed by UK (13.4%), Canada (5.3%), Australia and Sweden (3.7%). In the CAM sample, country of origin was determined in 458 (93.5%) of 497 assessed studies. Again, the USA was the leading contributor (24.9%), with China also emerging as a significant contributor (24.7%) in this field. For both samples, the contribution of smaller countries (especially Scandinavian countries, Greece, and Ireland) became more noteworthy when considered in relation to population size and research spending. Conclusions Our results support the leading roles of both the USA and the UK in publishing clinical papers. The emerging role of China can be seen, particularly related to CAM studies. Taking into account size of population and economic power, countries like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain provide small contributions. In contrast, smaller countries like Australia, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, and Sweden also play major roles."
https://openalex.org/W2065084489,"There are several known autosomal genes responsible for Ras/MAPK pathway syndromes, including Noonan syndrome (NS) and related disorders (such as LEOPARD, neurofibromatosis type 1), although mutations of these genes do not explain all cases. Due to the important role played by the mitochondrion in the energetic metabolism of cardiac muscle, it was recently proposed that variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome could be a risk factor in the Noonan phenotype and in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is a common clinical feature in Ras/MAPK pathway syndromes. In order to test these hypotheses, we sequenced entire mtDNA genomes in the largest series of patients suffering from Ras/MAPK pathway syndromes analyzed to date (n = 45), most of them classified as NS patients (n = 42).The results indicate that the observed mtDNA lineages were mostly of European ancestry, reproducing in a nutshell the expected haplogroup (hg) patterns of a typical Iberian dataset (including hgs H, T, J, and U). Three new branches of the mtDNA phylogeny (H1j1, U5b1e, and L2a5) are described for the first time, but none of these are likely to be related to NS or Ras/MAPK pathway syndromes when observed under an evolutionary perspective. Patterns of variation in tRNA and protein genes, as well as redundant, private and heteroplasmic variants, in the mtDNA genomes of patients were as expected when compared with the patterns inferred from a worldwide mtDNA phylogeny based on more than 8700 entire genomes. Moreover, most of the mtDNA variants found in patients had already been reported in healthy individuals and constitute common polymorphisms in human population groups.As a whole, the observed mtDNA genome variation in the NS patients was difficult to reconcile with previous findings that indicated a pathogenic role of mtDNA variants in NS."

The transformation is achieved by a glutathione S-transferase present in the gut epithelium. Experiments with 9-[(2)H]-iso-OPDA demonstrated the complete retention of the deuterium atom in the product 11-[(2)H]-OPDA consistent with an intramolecular 1,3-hydrogen shift. Homology modeling based on the x-ray structure of a glutathione S-transferase from Anopheles gambiae revealed that the co-factor glutathione does not covalently bind to the substrate but appears to be involved in the initial deprotonation and enolization of the OPDA. The transformation resembles that of a mammalian GST-catalyzed isomerization of Δ(5)-3-ketosteroids to Δ(4)-3-ketosteroids or the conversion of prostaglandin A(1) to the biologically inactive prostaglandin B(1)."
https://openalex.org/W2161323265,"The Faroe-Shetland Channel, located in the NE Atlantic, ranges in depth from 0–1700 m and is an unusual deep-sea environment because of its complex and dynamic hydrographic regime, as well as having numerous different seafloor habitats. Macrofaunal samples have been collected on a 0.5 mm mesh sieve from over 300 stations in a wide area survey and on nested 0.5 and 0.25 mm mesh sieves along a specific depth transect. Contrary to general expectation, macrofauanl biomass in the Channel did not decline with increasing depth. When examined at phylum level, two main biomass patterns with depth were apparent: (a) polychaetes showed little change in biomass on the upper slope then increased markedly below 500 m to a depth of 1100 m before declining; and (b) other phyla showed enhanced biomass between 300–500 m. The polychaete response may be linked with a seafloor environment change to relatively quiescent hydrodynamic conditions and an increasing sediment mud content that occurs at c. 500 m. In contrast, the mid-slope enhancement of other phyla biomass may reflect the hydrodynamically active interface between the warm and cold water masses present in the Channel at c. 300–500 m. Again contrary to expectation, mean macrofaunal body size did not decline with depth, and the relative contribution of smaller (>0.25 mm<0.5 mm) to total (>0.25 mm) macrobenthos did not increase with depth. Overall our total biomass and average individual biomass estimates appear to be greater than those predicted from global analyses. It is clear that global models of benthic biomass distribution may mask significant variations at the local and regional scale."
https://openalex.org/W1997995100,"We present experiments where the gating behavior of a voltage-gated ion channel is modulated by artificial ligand binding. We construct a channel-DNA chimera with the KvAP potassium channel reconstituted in an artificial membrane. The channel is functional and the single channel ion conductivity unperturbed by the presence of the DNA. However, the channel opening probability vs. bias voltage, i.e., the gating, can be shifted considerably by the electrostatic force between the charges on the DNA and the voltage sensing domain of the protein. Different hybridization states of the chimera DNA thus lead to different response curves of the channel."
