https://openalex.org/W2795989238,"For a decade, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program collected clinicopathologic annotation data along with multi-platform molecular profiles of more than 11,000 human tumors across 33 different cancer types. TCGA clinical data contain key features representing the democratized nature of the data collection process. To ensure proper use of this large clinical dataset associated with genomic features, we developed a standardized dataset named the TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource (TCGA-CDR), which includes four major clinical outcome endpoints. In addition to detailing major challenges and statistical limitations encountered during the effort of integrating the acquired clinical data, we present a summary that includes endpoint usage recommendations for each cancer type. These TCGA-CDR findings appear to be consistent with cancer genomics studies independent of the TCGA effort and provide opportunities for investigating cancer biology using clinical correlates at an unprecedented scale."
https://openalex.org/W2796153225,"Genetic alterations in signaling pathways that control cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, and cell growth are common hallmarks of cancer, but the extent, mechanisms, and co-occurrence of alterations in these pathways differ between individual tumors and tumor types. Using mutations, copy-number changes, mRNA expression, gene fusions and DNA methylation in 9,125 tumors profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we analyzed the mechanisms and patterns of somatic alterations in ten canonical pathways: cell cycle, Hippo, Myc, Notch, Nrf2, PI-3-Kinase/Akt, RTK-RAS, TGFβ signaling, p53 and β-catenin/Wnt. We charted the detailed landscape of pathway alterations in 33 cancer types, stratified into 64 subtypes, and identified patterns of co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity. Eighty-nine percent of tumors had at least one driver alteration in these pathways, and 57% percent of tumors had at least one alteration potentially targetable by currently available drugs. Thirty percent of tumors had multiple targetable alterations, indicating opportunities for combination therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2796153844,"We conducted comprehensive integrative molecular analyses of the complete set of tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), consisting of approximately 10,000 specimens and representing 33 types of cancer. We performed molecular clustering using data on chromosome-arm-level aneuploidy, DNA hypermethylation, mRNA, and miRNA expression levels and reverse-phase protein arrays, of which all, except for aneuploidy, revealed clustering primarily organized by histology, tissue type, or anatomic origin. The influence of cell type was evident in DNA-methylation-based clustering, even after excluding sites with known preexisting tissue-type-specific methylation. Integrative clustering further emphasized the dominant role of cell-of-origin patterns. Molecular similarities among histologically or anatomically related cancer types provide a basis for focused pan-cancer analyses, such as pan-gastrointestinal, pan-gynecological, pan-kidney, and pan-squamous cancers, and those related by stemness features, which in turn may inform strategies for future therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W2795867722,"Cancer progression involves the gradual loss of a differentiated phenotype and acquisition of progenitor and stem-cell-like features. Here, we provide novel stemness indices for assessing the degree of oncogenic dedifferentiation. We used an innovative one-class logistic regression (OCLR) machine-learning algorithm to extract transcriptomic and epigenetic feature sets derived from non-transformed pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny. Using OCLR, we were able to identify previously undiscovered biological mechanisms associated with the dedifferentiated oncogenic state. Analyses of the tumor microenvironment revealed unanticipated correlation of cancer stemness with immune checkpoint expression and infiltrating immune cells. We found that the dedifferentiated oncogenic phenotype was generally most prominent in metastatic tumors. Application of our stemness indices to single-cell data revealed patterns of intra-tumor molecular heterogeneity. Finally, the indices allowed for the identification of novel targets and possible targeted therapies aimed at tumor differentiation.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI3NmRhODQwZGZlODRiZGZlNGQzZWQxYmRmOTZiYjYxMiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3NzQ3MjgyfQ.FsowVT5uyHxayu2WmreQdSDk0eqETEdgmzx4_1lZHV7o1rd-F0UAdsp_JTWpLw3XwxDDRQTx1slODh9M1jRtcGdESpsVMlZ0JM17x844CzB_8sZVqzLdz2ukeTa5bDWdYGb-8UNuPwIJkA4Wl_Crp7ADc1u_lCkAlrRx2mvKp9YA0xV_waj7_0GwX84RsgRxz3PVrlWzARnJYDBZtU1mac9fD6sSuxWXTrRWNTPl-iPEWMZIXw3NL9TltcPBUqOdhIoVXjOHK7mujv-z9K7XvkoBbB4dDwm-sW8d4a8tZybQYEmcrbQxiDEU8B30wvB1_Q_hFp66AcLPqQfPbjBC4w(mp4, (274.71 MB) Download video"

Here we assessed whole autopsy hippocampi from healthy human individuals ranging from 14 to 79 years of age. We found similar numbers of intermediate neural progenitors and thousands of immature neurons in the DG, comparable numbers of glia and mature granule neurons, and equivalent DG volume across ages. Nevertheless, older individuals have less angiogenesis and neuroplasticity and a smaller quiescent progenitor pool in anterior-mid DG, with no changes in posterior DG. Thus, healthy older subjects without cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric disease, or treatment display preserved neurogenesis. It is possible that ongoing hippocampal neurogenesis sustains human-specific cognitive function throughout life and that declines may be linked to compromised cognitive-emotional resilience.

It is possible that ongoing hippocampal neurogenesis sustains human-specific cognitive function throughout life and that declines may be linked to compromised cognitive-emotional resilience. Healthy aging is crucial in a growing older population (United States Census Bureau, 2017United States Census Bureau (2017). The Nation’s Older Population Is Still Growing, Census Bureau Reports.

Psychiatry. 2010; 15: 1152-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) may depend on adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), which is reported to decline with aging in nonhuman primates (Leuner et al., 2007Leuner B. Kozorovitskiy Y. Gross C.G. Gould E. Diminished adult neurogenesis in the marmoset brain precedes old age.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Reversible effect of X-irradiation on proliferation, neurogenesis, and cell death in the dentate gyrus of adult mice.Hippocampus. 2007; 17: 1230-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). New neurons are generated in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the adult human hippocampus, even after middle age (Eriksson et al., 1998Eriksson P.S. Perfilieva E. Björk-Eriksson T. Alborn A.M. Nordborg C. Peterson D.A. Gage F.H. Neurogenesis in the adult human hippocampus.Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1313-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (5054) Google Scholar), but the extent to which neurogenesis occurs in humans is highly debated and quantitative studies are scarce. Phylogenetic differences between humans and rodents mandate assessment of the different stages of neuronal maturation in the human DG. For example, striatal neurogenesis is found only in humans (Bergmann et al., 2015Bergmann O. Spalding K.L. Frisén J. Adult Neurogenesis in Humans.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7: a018994Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), while olfactory bulb neurogenesis is absent in humans (Bergmann et al., 2012Bergmann O. Liebl J. Bernard S. Alkass K. Yeung M.S.

Druid H. et al.The age of olfactory bulb neurons in humans.Neuron. 2012; 74: 634-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) but present in other mammals. Previous analyses of human AHN did not address the effects of aging, although studies have examined AHN in older populations (Eriksson et al., 1998Eriksson P.S. Perfilieva E. Björk-Eriksson T. Alborn A.M. Nordborg C. Peterson D.A. Gage F.H. Neurogenesis in the adult human hippocampus.Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1313-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (5054) Google Scholar). The density of doublecortin-positive (DCX+) cells were reported to decline from birth into the tenth decade of life (Knoth et al., 2010Knoth R. Singec I. Ditter M. Pantazis G. Capetian P. Meyer R.P.

Murine features of neurogenesis in the human hippocampus across the lifespan from 0 to 100 years.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e8809Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) in parallel with 14C-determined neuron turnover (Bergmann et al., 2015Bergmann O. Spalding K.L. Frisén J. Adult Neurogenesis in Humans.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect.

Using histological techniques that could not distinguish mature and immature neurons, several groups estimated that DG neurons did not decline in aging humans (Harding et al., 1998Harding A.J.

Differences in the pattern of hippocampal neuronal loss in normal ageing and Alzheimer’s disease.Lancet. 1994; 344: 769-772Abstract PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). In vivo brain imaging studies reported conflicting findings regarding age-related changes in specific hippocampal regions. While some studies observed age-related declines in anterior hippocampal volume (Malykhin et al., 2008Malykhin N.V. Bouchard T.P. Camicioli R. Coupland N.J. Aging hippocampus and amygdala.Neuroreport. 2008; 19: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), others found no volume change (Head et al., 2005Head D. Snyder A.Z. Girton L.E. Morris J.C. Buckner R.L. Frontal-hippocampal double dissociation between normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease.Cereb. Cortex. 2005; 15: 732-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), or altered hippocampal shape rather than volume (Yang et al., 2013Yang X. Goh A. Chen S.H. Qiu A. Evolution of hippocampal shapes across the human lifespan.Hum. Brain Mapp. 2013; 34: 3075-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Efforts to evaluate AHN in vivo face limitations due to inadequate spatial resolution and the inability to accurately differentiate hippocampal sub-regions (Ho et al., 2013Ho N.F. Hooker J.M.

Exercise enhances cerebral blood volume, which results in more AHN in mice and better cognitive performance in humans (Pereira et al., 2007Pereira A.C. Huddleston D.E. Brickman A.M. Sosunov A.A. Hen R. McKhann G.M. Sloan R. Gage F.H. Brown T.R. Small S.A. An in vivo correlate of exercise-induced neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5638-5643Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar), but it may have a reduced impact in older people (Maass et al., 2015Maass A. Düzel S. Goerke M. Becke A. Sobieray U. Neumann K. Lövden M. Lindenberger U. Bäckman L. Braun-Dullaeus R. et al.Vascular hippocampal plasticity after aerobic exercise in older adults.Mol. Psychiatry. 2015; 20: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, we quantified AHN, angiogenesis, and DG volume and their relationship in people of different ages, hypothesizing that they would concurrently decrease with aging and correlate with each other. Given the different functions of the rostral and caudal DG (Wu and Hen, 2014Wu M.V. Hen R. Functional dissociation of adult-born neurons along the dorsoventral axis of the dentate gyrus.Hippocampus. 2014; 24: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we assessed the anterior, mid, and posterior hippocampus postmortem from 28 women and men 14 to 79 years of age. In each region, we characterized and quantified angiogenesis, volume, and cells at different maturational stages in the DG neurogenic niche, using unbiased stereological methods (West, 1993West M.J. New stereological methods for counting neurons.Neurobiol. Aging. 1993; 14: 275-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). To avoid confounders, subjects studied had no neuropsychiatric disease or treatment. Healthy elderly people have the potential to remain cognitively and emotionally more intact than commonly believed, due to the persistence of AHN into the eighth decade of life. However, reduced cognitive-emotional resilience may be caused by a variety of factors such as a smaller quiescent neural progenitor pool, diminished angiogenesis, or decreasing neuroplasticity in the anterior DG. The generation of new neurons in the DG neurogenic niche starts from quiescent radial-glia-like type I neural progenitor cells (QNPs) expressing glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), sex determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2), brain lipid-binding protein (BLBP), and nestin (Encinas et al., 2011Encinas J.M. Michurina T.V. Peunova N. Park J.H. Tordo J. Peterson D.A. Fishell G. Koulakov A. Enikolopov G. Division-coupled astrocytic differentiation and age-related depletion of neural stem cells in the adult hippocampus.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 566-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). QNPs undergo asymmetric divisions and generate amplifying, or type II, intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) expressing Ki-67 and nestin (Encinas et al., 2011Encinas J.M. Michurina T.V. Peunova N. Park J.H. Tordo J. Peterson D.A. Fishell G. Koulakov A. Enikolopov G. Division-coupled astrocytic differentiation and age-related depletion of neural stem cells in the adult hippocampus.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 566-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). As type II INPs differentiate into neuroblasts, or type III INPs, they lose the expression of Sox2 and GFAP while gaining expression of DCX and polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), which is also expressed by immature and mature granule neurons (GNs) (Encinas et al., 2011Encinas J.M. Michurina T.V. Peunova N. Park J.H. Tordo J. Peterson D.A. Fishell G. Koulakov A. Enikolopov G. Division-coupled astrocytic differentiation and age-related depletion of neural stem cells in the adult hippocampus.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 566-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). GNs are the final product of the differentiation cascade and express neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN), Prox-1, calbindin, and βIII-tubulin (Encinas et al., 2011Encinas J.M. Michurina T.V. Peunova N. Park J.H. Tordo J. Peterson D.A. Fishell G. Koulakov A. Enikolopov G. Division-coupled astrocytic differentiation and age-related depletion of neural stem cells in the adult hippocampus.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 566-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In anterior, mid, and posterior DG, we characterized and quantified the following: QNPs expressing GFAP, Sox2, and nestin; type I and II INPs expressing Ki-67 and nestin; neuroblasts, or type III INPs, and immature GNs expressing DCX and PSA-NCAM; and finally, mature GNs expressing NeuN. The anterior DG was defined as the portion from the most rostral appearance of the DG to the start of the lateral geniculate (visible in coronal brain sections); the mid DG spanned the lateral geniculate; and the posterior DG went from the end of the lateral geniculate to the caudal end of the DG. We assessed the first steps of neurogenesis, specifically the abundance of QNP and type I-II INP cells in the anterior, mid, and posterior DG of 28 males (n = 17) and females (n = 11) between 14 and 79 years of age. Expression of transcription factor Sox2, required for maintenance of multipotent neural stem cells (D’Amour and Gage, 2003D’Amour K.A. Gage F.H. Genetic and functional differences between multipotent neural and pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 11866-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), labeled QNPs and declined with aging selectively in anterior-mid DG, regardless of gender; GFAP also labeled QNPs, showing the typical radial-glia-like morphology, with apical processes (Figures 1A–1E, 1M , and S1A; Video S1). Sox2/nestin+ and nestin+ type I-II INPs (Yu et al., 2014Yu D.X. Di Giorgio F.P. Yao J. Marchetto M.C. Brennand K. Wright R. Mei A. McHenry L. Lisuk D.

Nestin+ proliferating type II INPs also co-labeled with Ki-67, a marker of active cell cycle (Scholzen and Gerdes, 2000Scholzen T. Gerdes J. The Ki-67 protein: from the known and the unknown.J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3490) Google Scholar), and were found in the SGZ as seen in mice, and in the granule cell layer (GCL) (Figures 1F and 1I–1L), as we have shown in humans (Boldrini et al., 2012Boldrini M. Hen R. Underwood M.D. Rosoklija G.B. Dwork A.J. Mann J.J. Arango V. Hippocampal angiogenesis and progenitor cell proliferation are increased with antidepressant use in major depression.Biol.

Ki-67+ cells were stable between 14 and 79 years of age in human anterior, mid, and posterior DG in both sexes (Figure 1O). In summary, the Sox2+ QNP pool was smaller in the anterior-mid DG of older people and comprised approximately 1,000 cells per DG region (anterior, mid, or posterior), while nestin+ and Sox2/nestin+ INP type I-II cells, in the range of thousands per DG region, were not fewer in older humans in anterior, mid, or posterior DG. Ki-67+ cells, unchanged between 14 and 79 years of age, were in the order of 10,000 per DG region, likely including dividing cells of non-neuronal lineage (likely endothelial and glial cells). To test age-related changes in type II-III INPs and immature GNs, as well as activity-dependent neuroplasticity or migration, we used markers specific for this maturational phase. PSA-NCAM was detected in neural cells with immature, bipolar, and pyramidal morphology and is considered a marker of neuroblasts or immature GNs only when co-labeled with DCX (Song et al., 2012Song J. Christian K.M. Ming G.L. Song H. Modification of hippocampal circuitry by adult neurogenesis.Dev. Neurobiol. 2012; 72: 1032-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); however, when found alone and on cells of different morphologies, it is considered a marker of neuroplasticity (Varbanov and Dityatev, 2017Varbanov H. Dityatev A. Regulation of extrasynaptic signaling by polysialylated NCAM: Impact for synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2017; 81: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We found that PSA-NCAM+ cells in human SGZ, showing morphologies of INPs and immature GNs, and PSA-NCAM+ mature GNs were all fewer in anterior DG with older age, in both males and females, and had stable and cell-type-specific perikaryon volumes (Figures 2A–2G). Conversely, we found stable numbers of DCX+ and DCX/PSA-NCAM+ cells across the 65-year age span in both genders (Figures 3A–3C, 3G , and S1D–S1F), representing preserved type III INP and immature GN numbers (Yu et al., 2014Yu D.X.

Although we detected some DCX+ processes, they were rarely seen in adult human INPs (Figures 3A–3C and S1D; Video S2), as expected based on previous reports (Jin et al., 2004Jin K. Peel A.L. Mao X.O.

Murine features of neurogenesis in the human hippocampus across the lifespan from 0 to 100 years.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e8809Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). We confirmed PSA-NCAM/NeuN co-labeling, with most NeuN+ GNs not expressing PSA-NCAM (Figure 3D; Video S3). We did not see an age-related decline of DCX+ and DCX/PSA-NCAM+ INPs and immature neurons, suggesting stable neurogenesis in older humans of both sexes. The finding of fewer PSA-NCAM+ cells of different morphologies ranging from type II INPs to mature neuron morphologies most likely represents a decline in neuroplasticity in aging humans, which could include blunted migration, dendrite sprouting, long-term potentiation, and activity-dependent plasticity. Here we report results related to angiogenesis measures, including the number of new capillaries per cubic mm, new capillary area and length, and the number of bifurcations per capillary, as well as the estimated total number of mature GNs and glia and DG volume, in the anterior, mid, and posterior hippocampal region from individuals 14 to 79 years of age. Nestin is a marker of newly formed blood vessels (Boldrini et al., 2012Boldrini M. Hen R. Underwood M.D. Rosoklija G.B. Dwork A.J. Mann J.J. Arango V.

Nestin+ newly formed capillaries display distinct tube-like structure, clearly distinguishable from nestin+ INPs with a clear soma and processes (Figures 1G–1H and Figures 4A–4C). We assessed angiogenesis in anterior, mid, and posterior DG by measuring the length, area, and number of bifurcations of nestin+ remodeling capillaries and the number of new capillaries per mm3 throughout the tissue section thickness (50 μm) using Stereo Investigator and Neurolucida software (MBF), as previously described (Boldrini et al., 2012Boldrini M.

We estimated the volume of the anterior, mid, and posterior DG, including the volumes of GCL, molecular layer (ML), and SGZ, using the Cavalieri method (Simić et al., 1997Simić G. Kostović I. Winblad B. Bogdanović N. Volume and number of neurons of the human hippocampal formation in normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease.J. Comp.

We aligned outlines of the DG including SGZ, GCL, and ML (Figure 3E) from the most rostral to the most caudal hippocampal sections (Video S4), and we used them to calculate the volume of the anterior, mid, and posterior DG and SGZ-GCL. We found smaller total capillary area and length and shorter and less branched capillaries correlating with fewer PSA-NCAM+ cells selectively in anterior-mid DG (Figures 4D–4G and S2–S4). There was no correlation between a decline in capillary measures and the number of Sox2+, nestin+, Sox2/nestin+, Ki-67+, DCX+, DCX/PSA-NCAM+, NeuN+ cells, Nissl+ glia, or DG volume, regardless of gender (data not shown). There was no age-related change in the number of NeuN+ GNs or Nissl+ glia estimated using stereology, nor in the volume of the DG or the GCL-SGZ in anterior, mid, and posterior hippocampus of both genders (Figures 3E–3F, 3H, and 3I and Figures 4H and 4I; Video S4), as estimated using the Cavalieri method (Boldrini et al., 2013Boldrini M. Santiago A.N. Hen R. Dwork A.J. Rosoklija G.B. Tamir H. Arango V. John Mann J.

There was an age-associated decline in angiogenesis in males and females, correlating with less neuroplasticity as represented by PSA-NCAM+ neuronal cells of different morphologies. Mature GN, glia, and DG volume were similar in people 14 to 79 years of age of both genders. Aging effects on AHN, angiogenesis, and DG volume have not been studied concurrently in whole hippocampus postmortem from people with no neuropsychiatric disease or treatment and clear toxicology and neuropathology.

Our integrative approach links rare predisposition variants to functional consequences, informing future guidelines of variant classification and germline genetic testing in cancer. A sizable fraction of cancer is heritable (Lichtenstein et al., 2000Lichtenstein P. Holm N.V. Verkasalo P.K. Iliadou A. Kaprio J. Koskenvuo M. Pukkala E. Skytthe A. Hemminki K. Environmental and heritable factors in the causation of cancer--analyses of cohorts of twins from Sweden, Denmark, and Finland.N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar), but known common variants explain only a limited percentage of the genetic burden in cancer (Bodmer and Tomlinson, 2010Bodmer W. Tomlinson I. Rare genetic variants and the risk of cancer.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2010; 20: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). More than 100 genes, mostly tumor suppressors, have been found to harbor rare, predisposing alleles (Rahman, 2014Rahman N. Realizing the promise of cancer predisposition genes.Nature. 2014; 505: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Most reports on germline variants have focused on single cancer types, although mounting evidence has suggested shared predisposition factors across cancer types. Previous pan-cancer studies have highlighted pathogenic germline variants in tumor suppressor genes, including ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, and PALB2 in adult cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Lu et al., 2015Lu C. Xie M. Wendl M.C. Wang J. McLellan M.D. Leiserson M.D. Huang K.L. Wyczalkowski M.A. Jayasinghe R. Banerjee T. et al.Patterns and functional implications of rare germline variants across 12 cancer types.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 10086Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and the Collaborative Oncological Gene-environment Study (COGS) (Southey et al., 2016Southey M.C. Goldgar D.E. Winqvist R. Pylkäs K. Couch F. Tischkowitz M. Foulkes W.D. Dennis J. Michailidou K. van Rensburg E.J. et al.Australian Ovarian Cancer Study GroupPALB2, CHEK2 and ATM rare variants and cancer risk: data from COGS.J. Med. Genet. 2016; 53: 800-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), as well as TP53, APC, BRCA2, NF1, PMS2, and RB1 using 1,120 pediatric cancer cases from the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project (PCGP) (Zhang et al., 2015Zhang J. Walsh M.F. Wu G. Edmonson M.N. Gruber T.A. Easton J. Hedges D. Ma X. Zhou X. Yergeau D.A. et al.Germline mutations in predisposition genes in pediatric cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 373: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). As sequencing projects expand, large-scale, systematic analyses are needed to increase statistical power and to compare predisposition factors among gene categories and cancer types. Clinical interpretation of germline variants is a pressing challenge. Conflicting claims resulting from variability in sequencing technologies, analysis pipelines, and interpretations hinder the application of such knowledge (Amendola et al., 2016Amendola L.M. Jarvik G.P. Leo M.C. McLaughlin H.M. Akkari Y. Amaral M.D. Berg J.S. Biswas S. Bowling K.M. Conlin L.K. et al.Performance of ACMG-AMP Variant-Interpretation Guidelines among Nine Laboratories in the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Consortium.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2016; 98: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Recent American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics–Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG-AMP) guidelines provide a systematic method for interpretation of sequence variants for genetic disorders (Richards et al., 2015Richards S. Aziz N. Bale S. Bick D. Das S. Gastier-Foster J. Grody W.W. Hegde M. Lyon E. Spector E. et al.ACMG Laboratory Quality Assurance CommitteeStandards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology.Genet. Med. 2015; 17: 405-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14622) Google Scholar); however, a high fraction of variants is relegated to the uncertain significance (VUS) category, often due to rarity and conflicting results in existing databases and the primary literature. Systematic analyses of high-throughput data associated with germline variants, such as matching tumor sequencing and mRNA sequencing data, can provide evidence of functional consequences and further inform clinical interpretation. For example, allele fraction derived from sequencing analysis of matched tumor and normal samples can validate whether variants of tumor suppressors are undergoing positive selection in the context of the classic two-hit model (Knudson, 1971Knudson Jr., A.G. Mutation and cancer: statistical study of retinoblastoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1971; 68: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (5552) Google Scholar, Knudson, 2001Knudson A.G.

McLellan M.D. Leiserson M.D. Huang K.L. Wyczalkowski M.A. Jayasinghe R. Banerjee T. et al.Patterns and functional implications of rare germline variants across 12 cancer types.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 10086Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and mRNA analysis can validate whether a germline truncation results in reduced expression. Of note, the current ACMG-AMP guidelines do not make use of this type of somatic analysis evidence for evaluation of germline variants. In this study, we analyzed the landscape of pathogenic variants from 10,389 individuals across 33 cancer types in the TCGA cohort. We identified 8% of cases carrying pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants, ranging in prevalence from a striking 22.9% in PCPG to a scarce 2.2% in CHOL. Notably, we identified 33 such variants within oncogenes. In contrast to variants of tumor suppressor genes showing association with low expression (47.6% in bottom 25% of the carrier sample’s respective cancer cohort) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH; 38.5%), variants in oncogenes are associated with high expression (62% in top 25%). We further investigated the functionality of these variants through validation in other cancer cohorts and experiments on RET alleles. Finally, we discovered another 18 copy number deletions and nominated 47 VUSs based on multiple lines of evidences suggesting functionality. Altogether, our study represents the largest systematic discovery of rare, germline predisposition variants and provides a firm basis for addressing their functionality in cancer. The TCGA PanCanAtlas Germline Working Group analyzed germline predisposing variants in 10,389 samples across 33 cancer types (Figure 1). A focus group conducted variant calling on the Institute for Systems Biology Cancer Genomics Cloud (ISB-CGC), and the resulting calls were shared among all investigators for quality control and downstream analyses (Figure 1A). Specifically, we dockerized the GenomeVIP variant calling system (https://github.com/ding-lab/GenomeVIP) (Mashl et al., 2017Mashl R.J. Scott A.D. Huang K.L. Wyczalkowski M.A. Yoon C.J. Niu B.

Chen K. et al.GenomeVIP: a cloud platform for genomic variant discovery and interpretation.Genome Res. 2017; 27: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and deployed more than 121,000 virtual machines running for over 600,000 hr on the ISB-CGC during the course of the project. Variant calls from Genome Analysis Toolkit (McKenna et al., 2010McKenna A. Hanna M. Banks E. Sivachenko A. Cibulskis K. Kernytsky A. Garimella K. Altshuler D. Gabriel S. Daly M. DePristo M.A. The Genome Analysis Toolkit: a MapReduce framework for analyzing next-generation DNA sequencing data.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 1297-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (14776) Google Scholar), VarScan2 (Koboldt et al., 2012Koboldt D.C.

Our data-sharing paradigm effectively facilitated the analyses required by such an enormous project, avoiding both redundant computation in variant calling and storage of intermediate analysis files in various local computational clusters. The final set of 10,389 samples passed stringent quality control criteria, showing good coverage, no outlying numbers of variants called, and high concordance with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) array data (STAR Methods). Across germline-normal samples, quality control analysis revealed a coverage of 18 ∼174X for the 152 cancer susceptibility genes known to harbor rare, pathogenic variants (STAR Methods, Table S1, and Figure S1). The passed variant calls achieved an average precision above 0.99 when compared to the genotypes obtained through SNP array data (Figure S1). The germline exomes displayed high quality, with an average transition-transversion (TiTv) ratio of 2.88 ± 0.17 and lambda value (Koire et al., 2016Koire A. Katsonis P. Lichtarge O. Repurposing Germline Exomes of the Cancer Genome Atlas Demands a Cautious Approach and Sample-Specific Variant Filtering.Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 2016; 21: 207-218PubMed Google Scholar) of 0.034 ± 0.003. The median predicted percent false positive calls across 33 cancer types was less than 5%, ranging from 1.2% (MESO) to 16.1% (KIRC, Figure S1). These resources are shared with the cancer researcher community on the cloud for further evaluation across institutions worldwide. We developed an automatic variant classification pipeline called CharGer (Characterization of Germline Variants, https://github.com/ding-lab/CharGer) by adopting and extending the ACMG-AMP guidelines (Richards et al., 2015Richards S. Aziz N. Bale S. Bick D. Das S. Gastier-Foster J. Grody W.W. Hegde M. Lyon E. Spector E. et al.ACMG Laboratory Quality Assurance CommitteeStandards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology.Genet. Med. 2015; 17: 405-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14622) Google Scholar) specifically for rare variants in cancer. CharGer queries information from ClinVar (Landrum et al., 2016Landrum M.J. Lee J.M. Benson M. Brown G. Chao C. Chitipiralla S. Gu B. Hart J. Hoffman D. Hoover J. et al.ClinVar: public archive of interpretations of clinically relevant variants.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: D862-D868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar), including variant entry submissions and disease-gene associations reported. We also generated gene-specific databases for known susceptibility genes, including TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2, RET, and TERT (STAR Methods). Further, in total, we curated 152 genes that contribute to cancer susceptibility, adding 15 genes from the St. Jude PCGP germline study (Zhang et al., 2015Zhang J. Walsh M.F. Wu G. Edmonson M.N. Gruber T.A. Easton J. Hedges D. Ma X. Zhou X. Yergeau D.A. et al.Germline mutations in predisposition genes in pediatric cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 373: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), 11 from Cancer Gene Census-Germline, and 12 from recent literature (reference listed in Table S1) to a published list of 114 known predisposition genes (Rahman, 2014Rahman N. Realizing the promise of cancer predisposition genes.Nature. 2014; 505: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) (Table S1). Overall, each variant is evaluated using data available for any of 12 pathogenic evidence levels and 4 benign evidence tags from ACMG-AMP that contribute to a composite score used for automatic classification. After CharGer evaluation, known pathogenic variants in ClinVar and curated databases are marked as pathogenic, whereas variants with CharGer score > 8 as likely pathogenic, and those with CharGer score > 4 as prioritized VUSs (STAR Methods, Figure S2, and Table S1). We bench-marked this automated classification and demonstrated its high performance: achieving a sensitivity of 88% and a false-positive rate of 4.9% for detecting pathogenic variants out of 883 germline variants found in pediatric cancer classified by the PCGP expert panel (Zhang et al., 2015Zhang J. Walsh M.F. Wu G. Edmonson M.N. Gruber T.A. Easton J. Hedges D. Ma X. Zhou X. Yergeau D.A. et al.Germline mutations in predisposition genes in pediatric cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 373: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). We applied CharGer to classify variants found in our TCGA cohort into pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and prioritized VUS groups. CharGer initially prioritized 31,963 variants in these samples, 1,393 of which were labeled as rare variants (≤0.05% AF in 1000 Genomes and complete ExAC r.3.0.1) relevant to cancer, passing manual review in both normal and tumor samples (STAR Methods). Combining existing database curation and CharGer results, we classified these into 435 pathogenic variants, 418 likely pathogenic variants (Table S2), and 540 prioritized VUSs (Table S2 and Figure 1C). This catalog of 853 pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants expanded significantly from our previous study, which had focused solely on variants that truncate tumor suppressors in 12 TCGA cancer types (Lu et al., 2015Lu C. Xie M. Wendl M.C. Wang J. McLellan M.D. Leiserson M.D. Huang K.L. Wyczalkowski M.A. Jayasinghe R. Banerjee T. et al.Patterns and functional implications of rare germline variants across 12 cancer types.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 10086Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Across all cancer types, 4.1% of cases (n = 428) harbored pathogenic variants, and another 3.8% (n = 390) carried likely pathogenic variants (Figure 2A ). The frequencies of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants vary greatly across cancer types (Table S3), with the expected high rates in OV (19.9%) and BRCA (9.9%). Other cancer types that involve tissue types that are exposed to environmental factors, such as SKCM (6.2%) and UVM (5%), had lower percentages of carriers. Notably, 22.9% of PCPG (Fishbein and Nathanson, 2012Fishbein L. Nathanson K.L. Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma: understanding the complexities of the genetic background.Cancer Genet. 2012; 205: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), 14.1% of PAAD (Solomon et al., 2012Solomon S. Das S. Brand R. Whitcomb D.C. Inherited pancreatic cancer syndromes.Cancer J. 2012; 18: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and 12.5% of SARC (Ballinger et al., 2016Ballinger M.L. Goode D.L. Ray-Coquard I. James P.A. Mitchell G. Niedermayr E. Puri A. Schiffman J.D. Dite G.S. Cipponi A. et al.International Sarcoma Kindred StudyMonogenic and polygenic determinants of sarcoma risk: an international genetic study.Lancet Oncol. 2016; 17: 1261-1271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) cases carried such variants, suggesting significant contributions of rare germline predisposition in these cohorts. We investigated genes with enriched pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in each cancer type. Briefly, we first identified cancer types with potential higher enrichment by comparing to pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) non-TCGA cohort. We then conducted total frequency testing (TFT) (Basu and Pan, 2011Basu S. Pan W. Comparison of statistical tests for disease association with rare variants.Genet. Epidemiol. 2011; 35: 606-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) for one cancer type against all other cancer types, subtracting the ones with potential enrichment for each gene (STAR Methods). We identified 28 specific cancer-gene associations (FDR < 0.05) and 16 additional suggestive (FDR < 0.15) associations (Figure 2C and Table S3). The majority of these findings from the burden test are known associations. For example, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants of BRCA1 and BRCA2 are highly enriched in OV and BRCA (FDR < 1.15E−05), as expected, while BRCA2 also showed significant enrichment in PAAD (FDR = 0.012). PCPG is associated with a wide array of predisposition factors, including RET, SDHB, VHL, NF1, SDHD, and MAX. There were several new findings that may suggest unexpected germline susceptibility gene and tumor associations (Table S3). For example, five stomach adenocarcinoma patients carried five different PALB2 loss-of-function (LOF) variants (FDR = 0.038, nonsense and frameshift) with variable LOH (2 of 5 tumors) similar to that seen in other PALB2-associated tumors. Only one other recent report suggests this potential association (Sahasrabudhe et al., 2017Sahasrabudhe R. Lott P. Bohorquez M. Toal T. Estrada A.P. Suarez J.J. Brea-Fernandez A. Cameselle-Teijeiro J. Pinto C. Ramos I. et al.Germline Mutations in PALB2, BRCA1, and RAD51C, Which Regulate DNA Recombination Repair, in Patients With Gastric Cancer.Gastroenterology. 2017; 152: 983-986 e986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Similarly, three melanoma patients carried three different LOF variants in SDHA (FDR = 0.035, and very low expression levels)—a gene that was not previously associated with melanoma susceptibility. Strikingly, two LUSC and three GBM patients carry the same rare BUB1B missense variant, namely p.Q912H. A prior mouse model suggested that haploinsufficiency for BUB1B increases the development of carcinogen-induced lung carcinomas (Dai et al., 2004Dai W. Wang Q. Liu T. Swamy M. Fang Y. Xie S. Mahmood R. Yang Y.M. Xu M. Rao C.V. Slippage of mitotic arrest and enhanced tumor development in mice with BubR1 haploinsufficiency.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Thus, our results may have revealed novel cancer susceptibility associations that require further study. At the variant level, we identified 659 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 66 tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) (Figure 2D). We also discovered 33 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in five oncogenes: RET, AR, PTPN11, MET, and CBL. 21 RET variants were found across 11 cancer types. Some appear to be cancer specific; for example, all of the three pathogenic MET p.H1112R variants are observed in KIRP (papillary renal carcinoma), validating the previously observed co-segregation of the variant in hereditary KIRP (Schmidt et al., 1998Schmidt L. Junker K. Weirich G. Glenn G. Choyke P. Lubensky I. Zhuang Z. Jeffers M. Vande Woude G. Neumann H. et al.Two North American families with hereditary papillary renal carcinoma and identical novel mutations in the MET proto-oncogene.Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1719-1722PubMed Google Scholar). For tumor suppressors, we identified a total of 57 ATM variants, 36 BRIP1, and 29 PALB2, all in at least 18 cancer types. In contrast, multiple other tumor suppressor genes showed enrichment in specific cancer types, such as BRCA1, BRCA2 variants in BRCA, and OV (Figure 2C). For example, all four of the tumors containing the pathogenic BRCA1 p.C61G variants in the ring domain are breast-invasive carcinoma. To better understand the biological impacts of the discovered variants, we examined the extent of LOH using a statistical test we developed previously (Lu et al., 2015Lu C. Xie M. Wendl M.C. Wang J. McLellan M.D. Leiserson M.D. Huang K.L. Wyczalkowski M.A. Jayasinghe R. Banerjee T. et al.Patterns and functional implications of rare germline variants across 12 cancer types.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 10086Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (STAR Methods). We discovered 157 significant (FDR < 5%) LOH of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in tumors (Figure 3A ), 148 of which were found in tumor suppressor genes. In contrast, significant LOH is only observed in four variants of oncogenes, possibly due to their gain-of-function nature and less selection requirement for the activated mutated allele to be homozygous. To validate the allele specificity of the discovered LOH events, we further characterized both the normal and tumor read-count data and tumor copy number variation (CNV) calls using GISTIC (Table S4, STAR Methods). Variants showing suggestive LOH (FDR < 0.15 or tumor VAF > 60%, STAR Methods) showed similar extents of deletion to variants with significant LOH (Figure 3B). Thus, many of these are likely to be true events failing to reach statistical significance due to insufficient sequencing reads, adding up to 38.5% of variants (n = 254) in tumor suppressors showing LOH. We further confirmed that 154 of these LOH events in tumor suppressors are due to deletion of the wild-type allele (Figure 3C). As expected, strong LOH is observed in cancer types having high hereditary predisposition. The four OV samples containing BRCA1 p.Q1777fs, p.D825fs, p.W372∗, and p.E797∗ each showed highly significant LOH (FDR ≤ 3.43E−20), whereas BRCA2 p.E1857fs, p.E294∗, and p.Y1762∗ also showed strong LOH in the other three OV samples (FDR ≤ 3.27E−11). We further compared rates of LOH in BRCA1/2 across cancers, finding that most BRCA1/2 variants exhibit LOH in OV and a slightly lower fraction in BRCA and an even lower fraction but notable 11 such events in other cancers (Figure S3). The BRIP1 p.S624∗ variant showed pathogenic evidence from three independent ClinVar submitters and displayed strong LOH evidence (FDR = 1.31E−16) in an OV sample. RAD51C p.R193∗ showed LOH in both BRCA and OV (FDR = 3.04E−12 and 5.79E−05, respectively), but not SKCM (FDR = 0.933). MET p.H1112R, which was previously shown to cause malignant transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (Schmidt et al., 1998Schmidt L. Junker K. Weirich G. Glenn G. Choyke P. Lubensky I. Zhuang Z. Jeffers M. Vande Woude G. Neumann H. et al.Two North American families with hereditary papillary renal carcinoma and identical novel mutations in the MET proto-oncogene.Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1719-1722PubMed Google Scholar), showed LOH due to amplification of the variant allele in two of the three KIRP samples (FDR = 2.24E−05, 6.98E−3, 0.26, respectively). The positive selection of these germline variants in the tumor further validates their clinical relevance. Another manifestation of the two-hit hypothesis is a pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variant coupled with a somatic mutation in the other copy of the predisposition gene. We identified 37 candidate biallelic events when analyzing the tumors in our cohort (STAR Methods, Exact Poisson test, p < 1E−5, Figure 3D and Table S4). Six germline variants of ATM, including two p.T2333fs and one each of p.S2289fs, p.R23∗, p.E1267fs, and a start loss variant, were coupled with somatic ATM mutations. Three cases carrying distinct BRCA2 germline truncations, including p.T1598fs, p.A2314fs, and p.Q1037∗, also harbored BRCA2 somatic mutations (Figure 3D). A COAD case carried an MSH6 p.R248fs germline variant and a p.R248∗ somatic mutation that are mutually exclusive in all sequencing reads, clearly supporting the two-hit abruption of both alleles (Figure S3). Multiple tumor suppressor genes also showed expression patterns consistent with the two-hit hypothesis—an African American KIRP patient with onset at age 35 carried the pathogenic FH p.S187∗ germline variant and a somatic splice site FH mutation—and showed low FH expression (at 2.07% of KIRP). A BLCA sample carried the CHEK2 germline p.W93∗ compounded by four different CHEK2 somatic mutations subsequently showing low CHEK2 expression (at 1.7% of BLCA). Overall, these results provide supporting evidence of the two-hit hypothesis through LOH and biallelic events of predisposing alleles across many tumor types. In addition to expression associated with two-hit events, we systematically investigated the gene and protein expression in carriers of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants of the respective gene. Briefly, we calculated the percentile of gene expression for variant carriers relative to other cases in the same cancer cohort. We then conducted a differential expression analysis to look for genes expressed at different levels in variant carriers (STAR Methods). We identified 15 significant (FDR < 0.05, linear regression) and 6 suggestive (FDR < 0.15) gene-cancer associations (Figures 4A, 4B , S4, and Table S5).Figure S4Number of Truncations Associated with Bottom 25% Gene Expression in the Carrier across Different Predisposition Genes; Observing Truncating Variants Does Not Guarantee Low Gene Expression in the Carrier, Related to Figure 4View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In breast cancer, FANCM, ATM, BRCA2, CHEK2, and BRCA1 carriers all showed significantly lower expression of the respective gene (Figures 4A and 4B). In PCPG, RET carriers showed higher RET expression, whereas SDHB, NF1, and SDHD carriers have lower expression. In addition to breast cancer, ATM carriers exhibited significantly lower expression in LUAD and LGG. We then conducted the same analysis using RPPA data, investigating whether the effects extend to the protein and phosphoprotein levels (Figures 4C and 4D and Table S5). Notably, ATM carriers were significantly associated with lower protein expression in five cancer types, namely STAD, PAAD, PRAD, BRCA, and LGG. CHEK2 carriers also showed lower protein expression of the Chk2 marker in BRCA and suggestively in BLCA (FDR = 0.053). Overall, the associated gene expression showed distinct distributions for oncogenes versus tumor suppressors (Figure 4B). Pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in tumor suppressors are associated with lower distributions in gene expression than those in oncogenes (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p = 5.70E−7): 47.6% of such variants in tumor suppressors were associated with the bottom quartile of gene expression. In contrast, 62.1% of those in oncogenes were associated with the top quartile, suggesting divergent transcriptional regulation of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes carrying pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. On the variant level, all three tumors with the MET p.H1112R variant were in the top 25% MET gene expression in KIRP. Twelve cases carrying predisposing RET alleles showed high RET expression in their respective cancer cohorts, including 9 PCGP cases and, notably, 3 RET carriers from other cancer types not typically associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, including p.I852M in LGG (96%), p.D631Y in KIRP (84%), and p.R912P in READ (80%).

https://openalex.org/W2795686629,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) team now presents the Pan-Cancer Atlas, investigating different aspects of cancer biology by analyzing the data generated during the 10+ years of the TCGA project. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) team now presents the Pan-Cancer Atlas, investigating different aspects of cancer biology by analyzing the data generated during the 10+ years of the TCGA project. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a joint project of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). TCGA began in 2006 as a pilot project focused on three cancer types: lung, ovarian, and glioblastoma. Due to the success of the initial efforts, TCGA was reauthorized for a full production phase in 2009. In the following decade, TCGA collected more than 11,000 cases across 33 tumor types and generated a vast, comprehensive dataset describing the molecular changes that occur in cancer (Figure 1). Tissue sample collection and data generation were completed in 2013 and 2016, respectively. Network maker papers, which are integrative cross-platform analyses of TCGA data on individual cancer types have been published for 31 of the tumor types to date (https://cancergenome.nih.gov/publications), with the last two marker papers being prepared for publication in Spring 2018. It is difficult to overstate the value of the TCGA dataset. Its richness has enabled researchers to catalog specific genomic and molecular changes that occur in cancer, to define a more meaningful taxonomy of cancer types and subtypes, and to even investigate questions that were not imagined at the outset of the project, such as the mining of the data to discover new viruses and other microbial agents. The TCGA marker papers have served as additional resources for understanding the molecular features of these cancers, and a launching pad for individual researchers to deepen the exploration of the data generated. In the current issues of Cell, Cancer Cell, Cell Systems, Cell Reports, and Immunity, the TCGA team presents a series of 26 manuscripts investigating different aspects of cancer biology by analyzing the whole bolus of data generated during the 10+ years of the TCGA project. We have dubbed this effort, which was designed as the culmination of the project from a coordinated team perspective, the Pan-Cancer Atlas or PanCan Atlas, for short. The different manuscripts broadly fall into three categories: (1) cell of origin, with tumor aggregation based on a biological system approach (Pan-Gynecological, Pan-Gastrointestinal) or histological subtypes (Pan-Squamous Cell Carcinoma); (2) oncogenic processes across all the tumor types characterized (immunity, mutation, aneuploidy); and (3) surveys of the role different pathways play in the development of different tumor types. As with previous cross-cancer analysis, The PanCan Atlas efforts uncover patterns across related tissue types and provide the scientific community with a wide-ranging overview of different aspects of cancer biology revealed through comprehensive analysis of a large collection of cases. We do not see the PanCan Atlas as the final analysis of the data; but, instead, as another launching pad from which researchers can explore the ensemble of the data generated by TCGA to perform both specialized cancer research, and broader biomedical research. While the TCGA data and resulting analyses will continue to serve as a valuable resource for scientific exploration by the community, we believe that the greatest impact of TCGA has been its transformation of the way cancer genomics is conducted. Throughout the years, the operation of the TCGA project has produced a number of ancillary results that are impacting biological research beyond the findings derived from the rich TCGA dataset. Examples of these “intangible” results are:(1)Team Science. TCGA demonstrated that integrative, cross-platform, interdisciplinary investigation made possible by scientific consortia is an extremely valuable and valid model of research. The TCGA project was greatly enhanced by the depth and interconnection of different expertise, as teams of researchers set out to perform analytical tasks that would have otherwise been unattainable by individual efforts. Further, TCGA has demonstrated that consortia participation can be a career-building platform (contrary to the common wisdom that only first authorship can help in attaining senior position in academia). Even with most of the marker papers having only the network banner as a single author, many scientists have built a successful academic career through participation in TCGA. Early career scientists participating in TCGA have received academic credit and recognition, in many cases establishing themselves as the world leader in their field of analysis. Thanks to TCGA (and many other large-scale projects that also follow the model), team science will continue to thrive in biomedical research, benefitting science as well as the scientists.(2)Genomic Pipelines. Due to the richness of the datasets created, algorithm developers have been attracted to TCGA, creating and honing methods for genomic data analysis, since early days of the project. A number of these developers were not originally familiar with the oncology field. Many of the tools developed in the TCGA setting have become standards in genomic analysis of any kind, helping discovery in all forms of human disease investigation and even biology at large. The necessity of creating data that is consistent and reproducible across thousands of cases, along with the sheer size of the TCGA dataset, forced investigators to innovate in the fields of data science and computational biology. The protocols developed for tissue sample collection and processing, as well as the pipelines for genomic data production and analysis, have become one of the most frequently requested items from the TCGA program. Data are important, but how the data were generated is a vital aspect that many times lurks in the background. With the free access of all TCGA protocols, metadata have come to the main stage, where they truly belongs. Thus, the pipelines, standards, and best practices that TCGA developed have become invaluable resources for the research community, and will continue to serve as the backbone for future genomic research projects.(3)Sample Acquisition and Study Design. TCGA has been instrumental in highlighting the need for thoroughly annotated, high-quality tumor samples with matched normal controls and informed consent from the patient. When the project began in 2006, the idea of annotated samples with match controls was only truly present in the epidemiology field; thanks in part to the visibility of TCGA, it has come to be at the forefront of multiple areas in biological research. In fact, the NCI now requires that clinical trials follow a set of standard practices to make high-quality tissue samples available for researchers to perform correlative studies. Many of these requirements are taken directly out of the TCGA playbook. These improvements in clinical trial design and organization greatly facilitate the integration of cancer genomics and clinical cancer research, which can only result in easier translation of molecular discoveries to the bedside.4)Data Accessibility. One of the main tenets of the TCGA program has been that all the data generated must be accessible as a resource for the scientific community and the general public. TCGA developed and implemented policies where the data were available for public access even before the marker papers describing the characterization of each tumor type was published. Such an openness in sharing was truly innovative at the start of the project. The resulting publications, both within and outside the TCGA network, demonstrated that data sharing is not to be feared, but instead embraced, as it enhances the value of the data by allowing different viewpoints to do the analysis in original and unexpected ways. TCGA was one of the early pioneers of broad data sharing with appropriate privacy protections, leading the way for other models such as the International Cancer Genome Consortium data haring, and the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy. Additionally, this desire to allow data use by all interested parties, was the impetus in developing the NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC). The GDC houses data, not only from TCGA but from a host of genomic projects, uses standardized pipelines to process harmonized data files for cross-project comparisons, and provides access to both unrestricted, open-access, and protected, controlled-access, data. Moreover, the GDC has developed a visualization and analysis interface for the data that obviates the need to download petabytes by allowing users to simply explore the information through a webpage, fully democratizing the data access. We are proud that TCGA has enabled a significant shift in the way biomedical research is conducted, clearly establishing the model of resource generating projects done in a large team collaborative setting as vital for the elucidation of the complex, multi-dimensional problem of human disease. The PanCan Atlas provides an example of how these efforts can culminate in a set of harmonized data, standardized analysis, and synthesized research findings, that enhance our understanding of cancer biology, and move the field closer toward the goal of improving our ability to diagnose, treat and prevent cancer."

Here, we describe a biobank of patient-derived organoid lines that recapitulates the histopathological and molecular diversity of human bladder cancer. Organoid lines can be established efficiently from patient biopsies acquired before and after disease recurrence and are interconvertible with orthotopic xenografts. Notably, organoid lines often retain parental tumor heterogeneity and exhibit a spectrum of genomic changes that are consistent with tumor evolution in culture. Analyses of drug response using bladder tumor organoids show partial correlations with mutational profiles, as well as changes associated with treatment resistance, and specific responses can be validated using xenografts in vivo. Our studies indicate that patient-derived bladder tumor organoids represent a faithful model system for studying tumor evolution and treatment response in the context of precision cancer medicine."

Our findings unveil a critical function of Ψ in directing translation control in stem cells with important implications for development and disease. There is a growing realization that RNA modifications, evolutionarily conserved hallmarks of RNA, directly impact genetic information in development and disease (Blanco and Frye, 2014Blanco S.

New research has uncovered complex networks of RNA modifiers that directly steer the cellular epigenetic RNA landscape to control central RNA-based processes such as transcription, splicing, and translation (Roundtree et al., 2017Roundtree I.A. Evans M.E. Pan T. He C. Dynamic RNA Modifications in Gene Expression Regulation.Cell. 2017; 169: 1187-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). One of the most abundant and widespread nucleoside modifications in living organisms is the isomerization of uridine (U)-to-pseudouridine (Ψ), RNA pseudouridylation (Charette and Gray, 2000Charette M. Gray M.W. Pseudouridine in RNA: what, where, how, and why.IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Ψ is catalyzed by a family of evolutionarily conserved pseudouridine synthases (PUSs), which modify their RNA substrates as “stand-alone” enzymes or through an RNA-dependent mechanism that involves a multitude of antisense box H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) (Hamma and Ferré-D’Amaré, 2006Hamma T. Ferré-D’Amaré A.R. Pseudouridine synthases.Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Decades of research using different model organisms demonstrate that Ψ possesses biochemical properties that directly impinge on RNA biogenesis, structure, function, and coding potential with important implications for cellular homeostasis through modification of regulatory RNAs such as spliceosomal RNAs (snRNAs), rRNAs, and tRNAs (Ge and Yu, 2013Ge J. Yu Y.T. RNA pseudouridylation: new insights into an old modification.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 210-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Building upon these studies, the discovery of mutations in genes encoding PUSs provided important evidence linking Ψ impairments to the pathogenesis of severe human syndromes and cancer (Angrisani et al., 2014Angrisani A.

Kothe U. Eukaryotic stand-alone pseudouridine synthases - RNA modifying enzymes and emerging regulators of gene expression?.RNA Biol. 2017; 14: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Together, this evidence sparked new interest in the biological functions of Ψ and its contribution toward fundamental cellular processes involved in development and disease. Recent advances in high-throughput Ψ-sequencing approaches have shifted the paradigm for the role of RNA pseudouridylation in cells, illustrating that Ψ is a dynamic and widespread component of cellular transcriptomes (Karijolich et al., 2015Karijolich J. Yi C. Yu Y.T. Transcriptome-wide dynamics of RNA pseudouridylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This led to the discovery of novel Ψ sites within various types of RNA species not previously known to be modified, including a multitude of mRNAs from yeast to mammalian cells (Carlile et al., 2014Carlile T.M. Rojas-Duran M.F. Zinshteyn B. Shin H. Bartoli K.M. Gilbert W.V.

Remarkably, the majority of newly identified Ψ sites are highly inducible within cells and are catalyzed predominantly by stand-alone PUSs, including the multi-substrate synthase PUS7 involved in stress-induced RNA Ψ (Behm-Ansmant et al., 2003Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.T. Motorin Y. Branlant C.

Despite these findings suggesting that Ψ may provide a rapid means to rewire the genetic information within cells and tissues, there is still a major gap in our understanding of the posttranscriptional mechanisms by which PUS-mediated Ψ impacts gene expression dynamics and cell function. In this work, we uncovered that PUS7-mediated Ψ “activates” a new class of tRNA-derived small RNAs to control protein synthesis and stem cell fate determination. Disruption of this Ψ-driven regulatory circuitry critically impacts hematopoiesis and may contribute to human myeloid malignancies. These studies provide an unanticipated new layer of posttranscriptional gene regulation orchestrated by Ψ that directly impacts central developmental and oncogenic programs. The contribution of Ψ toward stem cell function through modification of the epigenetic RNA landscape has not been investigated. Hence, we sought to delineate the role of PUS-mediated Ψ during embryogenesis. We first measured the levels of three evolutionarily conserved multisubstrate PUS enzymes, namely PUS1, PUS4, and PUS7 (Karijolich et al., 2015Karijolich J. Yi C. Yu Y.T. Transcriptome-wide dynamics of RNA pseudouridylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), in an H9 human embryonic stem cell line (hESC) and IMR90 primary human fibroblasts (HF). Strikingly, PUS7 was selectively enriched in hESCs compared to PUS1 and PUS4, whose expression patterns did not change significantly (Figures 1A and S1A). As expected, the snoRNA-guided Ψ synthase Dyskerin was upregulated in line with previous findings illustrating its effects on transcription and telomere maintenance in pluripotent cells (Agarwal et al., 2010Agarwal S. Loh Y.H. McLoughlin E.M. Huang J. Park I.H. Miller J.D. Huo H. Okuka M. Dos Reis R.M. Loewer S. et al.Telomere elongation in induced pluripotent stem cells from dyskeratosis congenita patients.Nature. 2010; 464: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, Fong et al., 2014Fong Y.W.

Based on these observations, we hypothesized that PUS7 functions to modify the Ψ epitranscriptome of undifferentiated cells. Thus, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 to generate the first PUS7-knockout hESCs, denoted PUS7-KO (Sanjana et al., 2014Sanjana N.E. Shalem O. Zhang F. Improved vectors and genome-wide libraries for CRISPR screening.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 783-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar) and study the role of PUS7-driven Ψ in stem cells (Figure 1B). Surprisingly, there were no differences in cell proliferation, viability and expression of multiple pluripotency, and germ layer specific markers between wild-type (WT) and PUS7-KO cells maintained in culture over long periods of time without loss of self-renewal (Figures 1C, S1B, and S1C). However, we observed a significant increase in PUS7-KO cell size compared to controls (Figure 1D). This suggested that PUS7 depletion might promote metabolic alterations impacting cell growth, for instance changes in mRNA translation. Indeed, de novo protein synthesis rates were remarkably elevated in PUS7-KO hESCs (Figure 1E), which was consistent with a specific increase of cap-mediated translation in these cells (Figure S1D). Similar defects were observed in another PUS7-KO hESC independent clone (PUS7-KO2), ruling out possible clonal artifacts secondary to the CRISPR/Cas9-editing methodology (Figures S2A–S2E). The increases in translation occurred without changes in rRNA abundance and were not associated with aberrant mTOR pathway activation or proteotoxic stress-induced eIF2α phosphorylation (Figures S1E–S1G, S2F, and S2G). Furthermore, increased protein synthesis in PUS7-KO cells was completely rescued to control levels by stable expression of a wild-type PUS7 allele (PUS7-WT) (Figure 1E). Critically, a PUS7 catalytic inactive mutant, designated PUS7-D294A, failed to rescue increased protein synthesis in PUS7-KO hESCs, suggesting that loss of PUS7-mediated Ψ modifications was required for the translational alterations in these cells (Behm-Ansmant et al., 2003Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.T. Motorin Y. Branlant C.

Previous studies in yeast have been instrumental in delineating the contribution of PUS7 to tRNA and snRNA pseudouridylation and in defining its Ψ-consensus sequence “UGUAR” (R = G/A) containing the target uridine (U) (Behm-Ansmant et al., 2003Behm-Ansmant I.

Yet, transcriptome-wide Ψ profiling suggests that the repertoire of RNAs modified downstream of PUS7 is widespread and dynamically regulated upon stress (Karijolich et al., 2015Karijolich J. Yi C.

Nonetheless, a comprehensive analysis of the specific PUS7 RNA regulon in stem cells has not been performed. To chart genome-wide PUS7-RNA interactions at a single-nucleotide resolution in hESCs, we performed individual-nucleotide resolution UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (iCLIP-seq) (Huppertz et al., 2014Huppertz I. Attig J. D’Ambrogio A. Easton L.E. Sibley C.R. Sugimoto Y. Tajnik M. König J. Ule J. iCLIP: protein-RNA interactions at nucleotide resolution.Methods. 2014; 65: 274-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). Specifically, we isolated RNA from PUS7-KO cells reconstituted with an N-terminal FLAG tagged PUS7-WT (FLAG-PUS7-WT) allele, which rescued the translational defect in these cells. Mock-infected PUS7-KO cells were used as a control to exclude non-specific RNA binding (Figure 2B). Strikingly, iCLIP-seq revealed several previously unknown PUS7-RNA interactions, including RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcripts such as tRNAs, Y RNAs, vault (VT) RNAs, and U6 (Figure 2C; Table S1). Furthermore, PUS7 was bound to mRNAs and non-coding (nc) RNAs, mostly snoRNAs, consistent with previous data in yeast and mammalian cells (Behm-Ansmant et al., 2003Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.T. Motorin Y. Branlant C.

Importantly, iCLIP-seq peak analysis identified a new putative binding motif “GTT[CTA][GA]A” highly represented on tRNAs and other RNA species (52% of non-tRNAs) including VT RNAs, Y RNAs, snoRNAs, mRNAs, and ncRNAs extensively bound by PUS7 in hESCs (Figures 2D and S3G). Our computational analysis indicated that PUS7 might also bind other less enriched sequence motifs (data not shown). This suggests that PUS7 is likely to have a complex RNA-binding capacity, which may involve target recognition through secondary structures as recently proposed for the multi-substrate Ψ synthase PUS4 (Safra et al., 2017Safra M.

We validated these results by knocking out PUS7 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293T) that expressed PUS7 and observed a comparable high degree of PUS7-tRNA interactions and similar translational defects (Figures S3A–S3E).Figure S3Analysis of the PUS7-Driven RNA Regulon, Related to Figures 1 and 2 and Table S1Show full caption(A) CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis strategy to generate PUS7 depleted HEK293T cells.(B) PUS7-KO HEK293T cells display increased protein synthesis compared to controls.

Ignatova Z. Emerging roles of tRNA in adaptive translation, signalling dynamics and disease.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2015; 16: 98-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Having identified the PUS7 tRNAome, we hypothesize that PUS7-mediated Ψ might regulate translation by modulating tRNA levels. We first determined whether specific tRNA isoacceptors were bound by PUS7 in hESCs. Although tRNA sequencing is challenging due to their heavily modified status (Liu et al., 2016Liu F. Clark W. Luo G. Wang X. Fu Y. Wei J. Wang X. Hao Z. Dai Q. Zheng G. et al.ALKBH1-mediated tRNA demethylation regulates translation.Cell. 2016; 167: 1897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), replicate iCLIP experiments were consistently enriched for specific PUS7-cognate tRNA interactions (Figure 2E; Table S1). Thus, we reasoned that PUS7 loss might perturb the levels of individual tRNA identified by iCLIP-seq and performed next generation small RNA sequencing (smRNA-seq) on total RNA isolated from WT and PUS7-KO hESCs. Importantly, we did not observe significant differences in the frequency of individual mature tRNA isoacceptors including tRNA-Tyr (GUA), a primary PUS7 target in eukaryotic cells"
https://openalex.org/W2796205057,"Defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport have been identified as a key pathogenic event in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) mediated by a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72, the most common genetic cause of ALS/FTD. Furthermore, nucleocytoplasmic transport disruption has also been implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases with protein aggregation, suggesting a shared mechanism by which protein stress disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport. Here, we show that cellular stress disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport by localizing critical nucleocytoplasmic transport factors into stress granules, RNA/protein complexes that play a crucial role in ALS pathogenesis. Importantly, inhibiting stress granule assembly, such as by knocking down Ataxin-2, suppresses nucleocytoplasmic transport defects as well as neurodegeneration in C9ORF72-mediated ALS/FTD. Our findings identify a link between stress granule assembly and nucleocytoplasmic transport, two fundamental cellular processes implicated in the pathogenesis of C9ORF72-mediated ALS/FTD and other neurodegenerative diseases."

Influenza is an acute respiratory illness that causes up to 5 million cases of influenza virus infection and 250,000–640,000 deaths annually around the world (Iuliano et al., 2017Iuliano A.D. Roguski K.M. Chang H.H. Muscatello D.J. Palekar R. Tempia S. Cohen C. Gran J.M. Schanzer D. Cowling B.J. et al.Global Seasonal Influenza-associated Mortality Collaborator NetworkEstimates of global seasonal influenza-associated respiratory mortality: a modelling study.Lancet. 2017; (Published online December 14, 2017)https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)33293-2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). The influenza virus has two main surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA, the more abundant protein, mediates binding to sialic acid receptors and subsequent fusion between the virus and host cell membranes. The less-abundant tetrameric NA protein is essential for cleaving terminal sialic acid residues present on host cell surfaces, allowing the release of the newly formed viral particles (Matrosovich et al., 2004Matrosovich M.N. Matrosovich T.Y. Gray T. Roberts N.A. Klenk H.D. Neuraminidase is important for the initiation of influenza virus infection in human airway epithelium.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12665-12667Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, Palese and Compans, 1976Palese P. Compans R.W. Inhibition of influenza virus replication in tissue culture by 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-trifluoroacetylneuraminic acid (FANA): mechanism of action.J. Gen. Virol. 1976; 33: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Currently, the seasonal influenza virus vaccine is the most widely available method to reduce the annual impact of influenza infection (Nichol, 2008Nichol K.L. Efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccination.Vaccine. 2008; 26: D17-D22Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). HA-reactive antibodies are typically considered the de facto mediators of protection from influenza infection; indeed, inhibition of HA activity has been the primary measure of influenza vaccine efficacy for decades. Therefore, most of the current approaches for vaccine design focus on inducing an antibody response to influenza virus HA. Influenza vaccine effectiveness can vary widely from season to season such that protection is always limited. For example, vaccine effectiveness ranged from only 19%–48% during the past three influenza seasons (Flannery et al., 2017Flannery B. Chung J.R. Thaker S.N. Monto A.S. Martin E.T. Belongia E.A. McLean H.Q. Gaglani M. Murthy K. Zimmerman R.K. et al.Interim Estimates of 2016-17 Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness - United States, February 2017.MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. 2017; 66: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that HA antigenic drift (viral genome point mutations) is the primary reason for the limited effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccine (Karron and Collins, 2013Karron R.A. Collins P.L. Parainfluenza viruses.in: Fields Virology: Sixth Edition. Wolters Kluwer Health Adis (ESP), 2013Google Scholar). Due to viral mutations, preexisting antibodies often show limited neutralization against currently circulating viruses (Wohlbold and Krammer, 2014Wohlbold T.J. Krammer F. In the shadow of hemagglutinin: a growing interest in influenza viral neuraminidase and its role as a vaccine antigen.Viruses. 2014; 6: 2465-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although point mutations also occur in the NA protein, the rate of antigenic drift around the active site of NA in the head domain is slower than that for HA among influenza A viruses (Abed et al., 2002Abed Y. Hardy I. Li Y. Boivin G. Divergent evolution of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes in recent influenza A:H3N2 viruses isolated in Canada.J. Med. Virol. 2002; 67: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Air, 2012Air G.M. Influenza neuraminidase.Influenza Other Respi. Viruses. 2012; 6: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Historically, NA has served as an important target for antivirals or therapeutics due to its critical role in the influenza virus replication cycle (Wohlbold and Krammer, 2014Wohlbold T.J. Krammer F. In the shadow of hemagglutinin: a growing interest in influenza viral neuraminidase and its role as a vaccine antigen.Viruses. 2014; 6: 2465-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NA activity is the basis of commonly used influenza therapeutics, including oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza), laninamivir (Inavir), and peramivir (Rapivab). Oseltamivir can reduce the median duration of influenza illness by 1.3 days and markedly reduces symptoms compared to placebo if given within 48 hr of symptom onset. In a prophylactic study, oseltamivir decreased rates of influenza infection 5-fold from 5% (25/519) for the placebo group to 1% (6/520) for the oseltamivir-treated group (Genentech, 2016Genentech. (2016). TAMIFLU (R) (oseltamivir phosphate) prescribing. https://www.gene.com/download/pdf/tamiflu_prescribing.pdf.Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of NA activity has become a standard of care for the treatment of influenza virus infections. The limitations of neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir are that resistant strains of influenza virus have readily emerged (Dharan et al., 2009Dharan N.J. Gubareva L.V. Meyer J.J. Okomo-Adhiambo M. McClinton R.C. Marshall S.A. St George K. Epperson S. Brammer L. Klimov A.I. et al.Oseltamivir-Resistance Working GroupInfections with oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1) virus in the United States.JAMA. 2009; 301: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), and the window for efficacy is limited to the first 48 hr of symptom onset. There are several mechanisms of NA-reactive antibody inhibition of influenza virus infection (Krammer and Palese, 2015Krammer F. Palese P. Advances in the development of influenza virus vaccines.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2015; 14: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). NA-reactive antibodies can prevent virus budding and egress from infected cells. These antibodies similarly inhibit viral escape from the natural defense proteins that trap the virus via HA-sialic acid interactions on mucosal surfaces. Moreover, NA-reactive antibodies bound to NA at the surface of infected cells might aid in the clearance of the virus through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (Wan et al., 2013Wan H. Gao J. Xu K. Chen H. Couzens L.K. Rivers K.H. Easterbrook J.D. Yang K. Zhong L. Rajabi M. et al.Molecular basis for broad neuraminidase immunity: conserved epitopes in seasonal and pandemic H1N1 as well as H5N1 influenza viruses.J.

Microbiol. 2017; 2: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). There is a long history of literature suggesting that immunity to NA could protect from influenza infection. The polyclonal antibody response to NA was broadly reactive and conferred protection against heterologous viruses in mice (Schulman et al., 1968Schulman J.L. Khakpour M. Kilbourne E.D. Protective effects of specific immunity to viral neuraminidase on influenza virus infection of mice.J. Virol. 1968; 2: 778-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cross-reactivity is evident even when there is substantial change within strain specific NA epitopes, resulting in a phenomenon of one-way drift (Sandbulte et al., 2011Sandbulte M.R.

Microbiol. 2017; 2: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Previous studies in humans have also shown that preexisting NA-reactive antibodies can reduce the number of cases of infection and decrease disease severity (Monto and Kendal, 1973Monto A.S. Kendal A.P. Effect of neuraminidase antibody on Hong Kong influenza.Lancet. 1973; 1: 623-625Abstract PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, Murphy et al., 1972Murphy B.R. Kasel J.A. Chanock R.M. Association of serum anti-neuraminidase antibody with resistance to influenza in man.N. Engl. J. Med. 1972; 286: 1329-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). However, on the whole, little is known about human antibody responses to NA, and most influenza vaccine development efforts both past and present are focused on targeting HA. Here, we report that unlike vaccination, natural influenza virus infection readily induces a high proportion of NA-reactive B cells. Thus, from infected patients, we were able to isolate and characterize protective antibodies binding NA epitopes, informing on the design of an NA-based component for influenza vaccination. The NA-reactive antibodies can be induced in humans or mice by infection or immunization with whole virions but bind epitopes not efficiently detected in the Fluarix or Fluzone influenza vaccines. Importantly, these NA-reactive mAbs bind a broad spectrum of influenza virus strains, often spanning the entire circulation history in humans for that NA group. Moreover, these antibodies have robust NA inhibition (NI) activity and provide prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection in vivo. Our data suggest that the next-generation of influenza vaccines should be optimized to improve the NA humoral immune response to induce broadly cross-reactive and protective NA-reactive antibody responses. While characterizing the specificity of plasmablasts induced by influenza virus infection, we noted a surprisingly high proportion of NA-reactive cells. The specificity of plasmablasts was evaluated by ELISPOT or mAb characterization from a total of 16 confirmed influenza-infected patients. Notably, as previously reported (Andrews et al., 2015Andrews S.F. Huang Y. Kaur K. Popova L.I. Ho I.Y. Pauli N.T. Henry Dunand C.J. Taylor W.M. Lim S. Huang M. et al.Immune history profoundly affects broadly protective B cell responses to influenza.Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7: 316ra192Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), plasmablasts are highly representative of the memory compartment, accounting for almost half of the memory cells activated in future responses to similar influenza strains. These patients included 11 subjects infected with the H1N1 pandemic strain (five from 2009 and six from 2016) and five infected with H3N2 virus strains (three from 2014 and two from 2017) (Table S1). First, we analyzed large numbers of activated plasmablasts in six influenza-virus-infected patients (four infected with H1N1 in 2016 and two infected with H3N2 in 2017). Scoring of thousands of activated plasmablasts by ELISPOT assay detected an average of 24% that were reactive to NA and 38% to HA (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, plasmablasts from H3N2-infected patients predominantly targeted NA. To more rigorously assess the frequency of NA-reactive B cells activated during infection, we characterized mAbs obtained from patients. For this, the isolated variable region genes from single plasmablasts activated by infection were used to express 128 influenza-binding mAb proteins from 12 of the patients using methods previously described (Smith et al., 2009Smith K. Garman L. Wrammert J. Zheng N.Y. Capra J.D. Ahmed R. Wilson P.C. Rapid generation of fully human monoclonal antibodies specific to a vaccinating antigen.Nat.

Helms C. et al.Rapid cloning of high-affinity human monoclonal antibodies against influenza virus.Nature. 2008; 453: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). The NA-reactive mAbs were more often encoded by VH3 family genes but used variable genes that were otherwise similar to HA antibodies (Figure S1). Consistent with the ELISPOT assays, 22.6% (29/128)—and on average, 24% by year and strain—of plasmablast mAbs activated by influenza virus infection were reactive to recombinant NA (rNA) (Figures 1B–1D). These mAbs included 15/88 that were N1 reactive and 14/40 that were N2 reactive (mAbs by subject indicated in Table S1). Notably, as with the ELISPOT analysis, H3N2 virus infections consistently induced a higher proportion of NA-reactive B cells compared to HA-reactive B cells (Figures 1A and 1D [blue dots]). By comparison, activation of NA-reactive B cells was quite rare 7 days after vaccination, accounting for only 1.2% (2/258) of vaccine-induced plasmablasts relative to 87% that targeted HA and 12% binding other influenza antigens (Figure 1E). This observation was consistent for several influenza virus vaccine compositions, including 1.5% (2/133) of NA-reactive cells after immunization with a subunit vaccine (from 2006–2008 and in 2010), 1.1% (1/89) after the 2009 H1N1 monovalent vaccine, and none (0/36) induced by split vaccines (2008–2010) (Figure 1E). We conclude from this analysis that a quarter of plasmablasts induced by natural influenza virus infection target NA—a percentage that nearly equals that of HA-specific plasmablasts—compared to only 1%–2% from influenza vaccination.Figure S1Influenza Virus Infection Induced NA-Reactive Plasmablasts that Were VH3 Biased, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A and B) The usage of VH immunoglobulin genes by (A) NA-reactive B cells and (B) HA-reactive B cells.(C) CDR3 length of NA and HA-reactive mAbs, data are represented as mean ± SD.(D) Total heavy chain mutation number of NA and HA-reactive mAbs based on analysis using the NCBI IgBlast tool (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/), data are represented as mean ± SD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A and B) The usage of VH immunoglobulin genes by (A) NA-reactive B cells and (B) HA-reactive B cells.

The greater induction of NA-reactive plasmablasts during natural infection may be because the live intact virus displays epitopes not present in the inactivated vaccines. Memory to conserved epitopes appears to play a role in the observed bias, as serological studies have shown an induction of NA-reactive antibodies to past strains (Rajendran et al., 2017Rajendran M. Nachbagauer R. Ermler M.E. Bunduc P. Amanat F. Izikson R. Cox M. Palese P. Eichelberger M. Krammer F. Analysis of Anti-Influenza Virus Neuraminidase Antibodies in Children, Adults, and the Elderly by ELISA and Enzyme Inhibition: Evidence for Original Antigenic Sin.MBio. 2017; 8Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Both HA and NA antibodies were encoded from highly mutated variable genes, supporting a memory cell recall origin (Figure S1). Furthermore, first exposure to the 2009 pandemic influenza virus strain induced NA-reactive plasmablasts at detectable frequencies in only two of the five infected patients that we characterized (black versus red lines in the top row of Figure 1D). Conversely, exposure to that strain seven years later in 2016 or to H3N2 strains that have circulated since 1968 readily induced NA-reactive plasmablasts (Figures 1A and 1D). To determine if infection or exposure to whole virus particles could account for the increased NA targeting, we infected mice with live H1N1 or killed H3N2 whole virions as opposed to split/subunit vaccine. For this, mice were infected intranasally with a sublethal dose of live 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus or immunized intranasally with intact virions of inactivated H3N2 influenza virus followed by an intranasal boost with the respective virus strains 30 days later. Similar to what we observed in infected humans, serum responses in mice to NA were dramatically increased after immunization with whole influenza virions versus the 2015–2016 Fluarix quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Figures 2A and 2B ). To verify the preferred targeting of NA by whole virions at the cellular level, ELISPOT assays on whole splenocytes 8 days after secondary infection or immunization were used to measure the proportions of HA- and NA-reactive immunoglobulin G (IgG)-secreting cells that were activated. The frequency of NA-reactive cells was high after exposure to whole virions for both the H1N1 and H3N2 strains (Figures 2C and 2D). This observation was not dependent on viral replication, as the H3N2 influenza strain was inactivated. As with human infections with an H3N2 virus, more plasmablasts were specific to N2 than to H3 (Figure 2D). Although mice are not an ideal model of human immunity to influenza, it was surprising how accurately the response to whole virions reflected that of humans to both N1 and N2. Together, these experiments suggest that NA epitopes present on whole virions are not efficiently targeted by current influenza vaccines. To address this possibility directly, we tested the NA- and HA-reactive mAbs generated from infection-induced plasmablasts for binding to inactivated influenza virus vaccines. While HA-reactive mAbs bound the rHA protein with equal avidity to the vaccine, the NA-reactive mAbs had only negligible binding to the Fluarix (Figures 2E and 2G) or Fluzone (Figures 2F and 2H) vaccines. There was no notable difference in binding avidity by subtype (H1N1 versus H3N2) or by vaccine batch. Five mAbs that bound poorly to the vaccines maintained full avidity against inactivated the H3N2 virus used for the mouse immunization experiments (Figures 2A–2D), demonstrating that gentle inactivation protocols can maintain key NA epitopes (Figure S2). We conclude from these studies that current influenza virus vaccines have insufficient NA content or NA protein structural integrity to induce NA-reactive antibody responses efficiently.Figure S2Formaldehyde-Treated Viruses Maintains the Immunogenicity of HA or NA Antigens, Related to Figure 2Show full captionSeveral representative HA-reactive or NA-reactive mAbs were tested for binding by ELISA to A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 virus or inactivated A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 virus.(A) HA-reactive mAbs (spots color in red are the HA-stalk reactive mAbs).(B) NA-reactive mAbs (spots colored in red are the NA-STAR positive mAbs binding around the enzymatic site in Figure 6C).

Data are representative of two independent experiments, data are represented as median. To determine the breadth of binding of the NA-reactive mAbs induced by infection, ELISA was used to test binding against a diverse panel of rNA proteins (Figure 3A). All of the N2-reactive mAbs cross-reacted to all contemporary H3N2 influenza strains, and also, a surprising 86% (12/14) reacted to the first pandemic H3N2 virus strain known to infect humans (A/Hong Kong/1/1968). Considering that the 1968 H3N2 pandemic virus expressed the NA protein from a reassortant strain with the 1957 H2N2 strain (Scholtissek et al., 1978Scholtissek C. Koennecke I. Rott R. Host range recombinants of fowl plague (influenza A) virus.Virology. 1978; 91: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that 71% (10/14) of the antibodies reacted to the H2N2 influenza strain that circulated since 1957—11 years prior. By comparison, only 40% of infection-induced and half of the vaccine-induced H3-reactive mAbs were cross-reactive to this 1968 H3N2 strain (Figure 3B). Moreover, 64% (9/14) of the N2-reactive mAbs induced by infection, including two mAbs with cross-reactivity to heterosubtypic subtypes (N3 and N9), were able to bind to avian N2 proteins (Figure 3A). Of the N1-reactive mAbs, 67% of cross-reacted to the 1918 pandemic H1N1 strain, 33% reacted to various human H1N1 strains spanning the entire century, and 20% bound to heterosubtypic strains (Figure 3A). Additionally, demonstrating durability of the NA-epitopes, incubating H3N2 (A/Switzerland/9715293/2013) virus with mAb concentrations up to 250 μg did not induce viral escape mutants even after 8 (229-1A02, 229-1D05, and 229-1G03) or 13 (228-2D04, 229-2B04, and 229-2C06) passages—an approach that does induce escape to arise from highly conserved HA-stalk mAbs (Anderson et al., 2017Anderson C.S. Ortega S. Chaves F.A. Clark A.M. Yang H. Topham D.J. DeDiego M.L. Natural and directed antigenic drift of the H1 influenza virus hemagglutinin stalk domain.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 14614Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). On the whole, the NA-reactive mAbs induced during influenza virus infections are significantly more broadly reactive than antibodies against HA. The enzymatic function of NA is to cleave the terminal sialic acid residues, allowing viral egress from infected cells. To better access the protective capacity of the NA-reactive mAbs, inhibition of sialic acid cleavage was evaluated using ELLA and NA-STAR assays. For ELLA, the sialic acid substrate is found on bulky glycans on the fetuin glycoprotein. If an antibody binds to NA, even outside of the enzymatic site, it sterically blocks access of the enzymatic site to sialic acid, making this assay more sensitive to multiple mechanisms of NI activity. Conversely, the NA-STAR assay uses a small, soluble chemiluminescent substrate that easily accesses the enzymatic site unless an antibody binds in close proximity to the enzymatic site. Using ELLA, 79% (11/14) of the N2-reactive mAbs—of which about half (5 /14) were also positive in the NA-STAR assay, likely demonstrating activity through blockage or allosteric mechanisms of inhibition—inhibited NA activity against A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2). Importantly, by either assay, all of these mAbs inhibited the first pandemic H3N2 strain A/Hong Kong/1/1968 as well as A/Philippines/2/1982 (X-79) (Figure 4A). The antibody 229-1D05 also had broad NI activity against swine influenza virus strain A/swine/Missouri/4296424/2006 (H6N3, H6 is from A/mallard/Sweden/81/2002, PR8 backbone) (Figure S3). Therefore, these mAbs have broad NI activity spanning five decades of H3N2 virus evolution. For mAbs reactive to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain, 53% (8/15) had NI activity by any means as detected by ELLA, and 20% blocked the enzymatic domain, showing inhibition via the NA-STAR assay. As with the N2-reactive mAbs, N1-reactive mAbs had broad activity against the 1918 pandemic strain A/Brevig Mission/1/1918, against A/New Caledonia/20/99, and against the avian A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) and A/rhea/NC/39482/93 (H7N1) strains (Figure 4B).Figure S3NI Activities of Cross-Binding NA-Reactive mAbs against Avian H6N3, H9N4, and H3N8 viruses, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Cross N2-reactive mAbs were tested for inhibiting NA enzymatic activity via ELLA assay against A/swine/Missouri/4296424/2006 (H6N3, H6 is from A/mallard/Sweden/81/2002, PR8 backbone).(B) Cross N1-reactive mAbs were tested for inhibiting NA enzymatic activity via ELLA assay against A/mallard/Sweden/24/2002 (H9N4, H9 is from A/guinea fowl/Hong Kong/WF10/99, PR8 backbone).(C) Cross N1-reactive mAbs were tested for inhibiting NA enzymatic activity via ELLA assay against A/Northern shoveler/Alaska/7MP1708/07 (H3N8).

In the nearly half century of the “War on Cancer,” prevention and treatment have progressed significantly, but many forms of the disease remain incurable. The advent of large-scale DNA sequencing ushered in new possibilities. Beginning with coding regions (Sjöblom et al., 2006Sjöblom T. Jones S. Wood L.D. Parsons D.W. Lin J. Barber T.D. Mandelker D.

Molecular and genetic properties of tumors associated with local immune cytolytic activity.Cell. 2015; 160: 48-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Each area shows enormous promise. The era of the first large genome sequences was called the “end of the beginning” of genomics. It seems fitting to call the conclusion of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) the end of the beginning of cancer genomics. TCGA has systematized large-scale genomics-based cancer research, with its projects and data on 11,000 tumors from 33 cancer types having led to enormous advancements. The TCGA PanCancer Atlas project has a special focus on the oncogenic processes governing cancer development and progression, with its ten analysis working groups (AWGs) presenting their findings. Together we synthesized findings from consensus somatic mutation calling, fusion detection, splicing events, aneuploidy, image analysis, and the immune system in oncogenesis (Figure 1). Here, we concentrate on three themes: (1) interactions between somatic drivers and germline pathogenic variants; (2) links across genomic substrates, i.e., methylome, transcriptome, and proteome; and (3) tumor microenvironment and implications for targeted and immune therapies. We begin each section with an overview from AWG results and follow with additional analyses addressing questions not explored in individual AWG papers. The results of the PanCancer Atlas project will provide a foundation for subsequent phases of deeper, broader, and more sophisticated work that holds great promise for personalized cancer care. Previous TCGA studies often concentrated on focal copy-number alterations rather than chromosomal-level aneuploidy. The PanCancer Atlas Aneuploidy AWG systematically quantified aneuploidy (Taylor et al., 2018Taylor A.M. Shih J. Ha G. Gao G.F. Zhang X. Berger A.C. Schumacher S.E. Wang C. Hu H. Liu J. Lazar A.J. Cherniack A.D. Beroukhim R. Meyerson M.

Gene fusions, which can drive overexpression or create fusion proteins, are another important class of drivers. The Fusion AWG systematically characterized fusions (Gao et al., 2018Gao Q. Liang W.-W. Foltz S.M. Mutharasu G. Jayasinghe R.G. Cao S. Liao W.-W. Reynolds S.M. Wyczalkowski M.A. Yao L. et al.Driver fusions and their implications in the development and treatment of human cancers.Cell Rep. 2018; 23https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar), finding that they are recurrent and disease defining in some neoplasms (e.g., SS18/SSX1 or SSX2 fusion in synovial sarcoma). In others, fusion drivers are present in small subsets of tumors (ALK or ROS1 fusions in lung adenocarcinoma). The accompanying mutational events and how they differ among cancers provide functional insights (Gao et al., 2018Gao Q. Liang W.-W. Foltz S.M. Mutharasu G. Jayasinghe R.G. Cao S. Liao W.-W. Reynolds S.M. Wyczalkowski M.A. Yao L. et al.Driver fusions and their implications in the development and treatment of human cancers.Cell Rep. 2018; 23https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Two other AWGs systematically characterized germline and somatic variants across 33 cancer types (Table S1) (Huang et al., 2018Huang K. Mashl R.J. Wu Y. Ritter D.I. Wang J. Oh C. Paczkowska M. Reynolds S. Wyczalkowski M.A. Oak N. et al.Pathogenic germline variants in 10,389 adult cancers.Cell. 2018; 173https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (174) Google Scholar, Ellrott et al., 2018Ellrott K.

They generated and analyzed 1.5 billion germline (Huang et al., 2018Huang K. Mashl R.J. Wu Y. Ritter D.I. Wang J. Oh C. Paczkowska M. Reynolds S. Wyczalkowski M.A. Oak N. et al.Pathogenic germline variants in 10,389 adult cancers.Cell. 2018; 173https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and ∼3.6 million somatic calls (Ellrott et al., 2018Ellrott K. Bailey M.H. Saksena G. Covington K.R. Kandoth C. Stewart C. Hess J. Ma S. McLellan M. Sofia H.J. et al.Scalable open science approach for mutation calling of tumor exomes using multiple genomic pipelines.Cell Syst. 2018; 6https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.03.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), making TCGA PanCancer Atlas the largest resource for investigating joint variant contributions to cancer. The germline group highlighted the two-hit hypothesis through loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and compound heterozygosity, rare copy-number events, and additional evidence supporting variant pathogenicity. The somatic dataset anchored a comprehensive analysis using 26 bioinformatic tools, identifying 299 driver genes and over 3,400 oncogenic mutations (Bailey et al., 2018Bailey M.H. Tokheim C. Porta-Pardo E. Sengupta S. Bertrand D. Weerasinghe A. Colaprico A. Wendl M.C. Kim J. Reardon B. et al.Comprehensive Characterization of Cancer Driver Genes and Mutations.Cell. 2018; 173https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Similarly, the PanCancer Atlas Germline group identified >800 pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in 99 predisposition genes affecting ∼8% of all cases (Huang et al., 2018Huang K. Mashl R.J. Wu Y. Ritter D.I. Wang J. Oh C. Paczkowska M. Reynolds S. Wyczalkowski M.A. Oak N. et al.Pathogenic germline variants in 10,389 adult cancers.Cell. 2018; 173https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Here, we used the 299 driver and 99 predisposition genes to study interactions of germline and somatic events in 9,389 samples (STAR Methods; Table S1). Many predisposition genes play roles in genome integrity (Figure 2A, green bars; Table S2). Alterations in these genes represent a higher fraction of germline variants (63%, 490/769) versus somatic drivers (14%, 8850/75825, p value = 7e−151 Fisher’s Exact Test), highlighting the role of genome integrity in cancer predisposition. The remaining somatic alterations are largely from genes involved in cell cycle, epigenetic modifiers, metabolism, oncogenic signaling, and transcriptional/translational regulation. We surveyed the frequency of cases showing disruptions of genome integrity in individual cancer types. Of the eight molecular process categories examined (STAR Methods), genome integrity dominates both germline and somatic alterations in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV) due to BRCA1 or BRCA2 predisposition variants and a high fraction of TP53 mutations. Other cancers are further skewed with respect to percent of cases carrying mutations involved in genome integrity; i.e., 4% of samples in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) have germline compared to 89% somatic (Figure 2B; Table S3). Most predisposition genes affecting genome integrity (64%, 23/36) belong to the Core DDR (DNA damage response) genes (Knijnenburg et al., 2018Knijnenburg T. Wang L. Zimmermann M. Chambwe N. Gao G. Cherniack A. Fan H. Shen H. Way G. Greene C. et al.Genomic and molecular landscape of DNA damage repair deficiency across The Cancer Genome Atlas.Cell Rep. 2018; 23https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) (Table S2). Several show high germline variant counts, including BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM, BRIP1, PALB2, and PMS2. When considering germline and somatic mutations jointly, the most frequently mutated genes are BRCA1 and BRCA2, together having 854 (571 samples) somatic and 153 (152 samples) germline mutations. We grouped samples with germline mutations, somatic, or no/low-impact mutations in these two genes by cancer type to establish associations between age of onset and somatic mutation load. Patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations develop cancer at younger ages compared to wild-type samples in OV, LUSC, and BRCA (false discovery rate [FDR] 9.12e−6, 9.23e−3, and 1.15e−2, respectively, t test). Mean age of diagnosis in patients with germline mutations is 54.4 ± 13.0 years (standard deviation), compared to 62.3 ± 13.4 years when the mutation is somatic across the pan-cancer cohort (p value = 2.07e−10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = (−10.27, −5.57); Figure 3A; Table S4). As expected, germline or somatic variants associate with higher mutation load across cancer types (Figure 3B), being observed in OV samples with germline BRCA1/2 mutations (FDR 3e−3, t test) and BLCA, STAD somatic (FDR 5.6e−3, 9.2e−6, t test). Many samples (250 out of 1,464) with non-synonymous somatic mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes have high microsatellite instability (MSI) status (MSIsensor score ≥4; Figure 3C; Table S5) (Niu et al., 2014Niu B. Ye K. Zhang Q. Lu C. Xie M. McLellan M.D. Wendl M.C. Ding L. MSIsensor: microsatellite instability detection using paired tumor-normal sequence data.Bioinformatics. 2014; 30: 1015-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Samples with germline pathogenic variants in MMR genes (18 out of 60) also have high MSI status. Notably, 16 of these 18 samples have both predisposition germline variants and somatic mutations in MMR genes (Table S2), representing a population with potentially higher neoantigen load and response to checkpoint-blockade therapy. Indeed, samples with MSIsensor scores ≥4 had higher expression of immune-response marker genes (GZMA, PRF1, GZMK, and GZMH) in the three cancer types with enough MSI high samples: colon adenocarcinoma and rectum adenocarcinoma (COADREAD), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov p < 0.01; Figure 3D). This highlights the influence of mutations and MMR genes and the MSI phenotype in the immune response against tumors. Finally, using Moonlight we found several pathways that are differentially expressed depending on whether the mutations affecting BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 are somatic or germline (Figures 3E, 3F, and S1). For example, BRCA samples with somatic mutations in BRCA1/2 downregulate genes involved in antigen processing and leukocyte cytotoxicity, whereas BRCA samples with germline BRCA1/2 mutations downregulate genes involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex and metabolic pathways. The impact of BRCA1/2 mutations may depend on both their somatic or germline status and the tissue of origin. Interactions among somatic driver genes, ranging from sequential dynamics to interactions of pathway and synthetic lethality, hold potential for therapeutic exploitation. We used the MC3 somatic mutation (Ellrott et al., 2018Ellrott K. Bailey M.H. Saksena G. Covington K.R. Kandoth C. Stewart C. Hess J. Ma S. McLellan M. Sofia H.J. et al.Scalable open science approach for mutation calling of tumor exomes using multiple genomic pipelines.Cell Syst. 2018; 6https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.03.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) dataset and the driver gene list (Bailey et al., 2018Bailey M.H. Tokheim C. Porta-Pardo E. Sengupta S. Bertrand D. Weerasinghe A. Colaprico A. Wendl M.C. Kim J. Reardon B. et al.Comprehensive Characterization of Cancer Driver Genes and Mutations.Cell. 2018; 173https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (401) Google Scholar) to identify pairs of drivers that are mutually exclusive or tend to co-occur (STAR Methods). We found an extensive network of interactions (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test FDR < 0.1; Figure 4A; Table S6). TP53 is the prime hub, co-occurring with IDH1, ATRX, PPP2R1A, RB1, and CDKN2A and mutually exclusive of PIK3CA, HRAS, CTNNB1, ARID1A, and FGFR3. As expected, driver genes and mutations that act via certain pathways/mechanisms show strong exclusivity, a primary example being BRAF and HRAS/NRAS/KRAS, all of which affect the Ras signaling pathway. Other examples are pairs of homologous genes, such as IDH1/IDH2 and GNAQ/GNA11, and interacting genes, such as PIK3CA and PIK3R1. These patterns held across virtually all 33 tumor types, indicating discovery of a key oncogenic relationship. We also observed exclusivity in specific tissues (Figure 4B), for example BRAF, NRAS, and HRAS in thyroid carcinoma (THCA) and GNAQ and GNA11 in uveal melanoma. At a larger scale, some cancer types require cooperation between gene networks. For example, in UCEC, there are two mutually exclusive networks, the first consisting of TP53 and PPP2R1A (and occasionally PTEN) and the second CTNNB1, PTEN, and CTCF. This is consistent with previous descriptions of UCEC subtypes, with TP53-driven endometrial tumors having a copy-number high phenotype and PTEN-driven endometrial tumors being copy-number low or hypermutated (either via MSI and/or POLE). Finally, we observed cancer-specific somatic-somatic interactions. For instance, TP53 and KRAS are mutually exclusive in COAD, READ, and LUAD (Table S6) but significantly co-occur in PAAD (Table S6). These observations highlight the importance of investigating both at the pan-cancer level and by tissue of origin (Park and Lehner, 2015Park S. Lehner B. Cancer type-dependent genetic interactions between cancer driver alterations indicate plasticity of epistasis across cell types.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2015; 11: 824Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The tumor genome and transcriptome interact at multiple levels. For example, 1%–2% of genome mutations have detectable effects on splicing, with potential to alter the transcriptome and biochemical pathways (Wang and Cooper, 2007Wang G.-S. Cooper T.a. Splicing in disease: disruption of the splicing code and the decoding machinery.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Locally, cis-mutations can disrupt or activate splicing factor binding sites or splice sites. The Splicing AWG analyzed 8,656 TCGA tumors, finding that 1,964 mostly missense and synonymous mutations create novel splice junctions (Table S1) (Jayasinghe et al., 2018Jayasinghe R.G. Cao S. Gao Q. Wendl M.C. Vo N.S. Reynolds S.M. Zhao Y. Climente-González H. Chai S.

They also produce neoantigens, often accompanied by an elevated immune response. Mutations in splice-governing genes result in large-scale abnormal splicing, providing potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets (Dvinge et al., 2016Dvinge H. Kim E. Abdel-Wahab O. Bradley R.K. RNA splicing factors as oncoproteins and tumour suppressors.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16: 413-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and acting as proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressors (Yoshida et al., 2011Yoshida K. Sanada M. Shiraishi Y. Nowak D. Nagata Y. Yamamoto R. Sato Y. Sato-Otsubo A. Kon A. Nagasaki M. et al.Frequent pathway mutations of splicing machinery in myelodysplasia.Nature. 2011; 478: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). The Spliceosome Pathway AWG surveyed 33 tumor types for somatic mutations of over 400 splicing factor genes, identifying 119 genes with likely driver mutations (Seiler et al., 2018Seiler M. Peng S. Agrawal A.A. Palacino J. Teng T. Zhu P. Smith P.G. Buonamici S. Yu L. et al.The Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkSomatic mutational landscape of splicing factor genes and their functional consequences across 33 cancer types.Cell Rep. 2018; 23https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.01.088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). They confirmed aberrant splicing of frequently mutated genes, suggesting that splicing de-regulation in cancer is broader than previously reported. Integrating profiles from individual molecular platforms can provide insights into the molecular state of tumors and identify samples with shared regulation (sample clusters) across multiple assays. A recent analysis (Hoadley et al., 2018Hoadley K.A. Yau C. Hinoue T. Wolf D.M. Lazar A.J. Drill E. Shen R. Taylor A.M. Cherniack A.D. Thorsson V. et al.Cell-of-origin patterns dominate the molecular classification of 10,000 tumors from 33 types of cancer.Cell. 2018; 173https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (357) Google Scholar) performed clustering of individual platforms and subsequent clustering of cluster assignments (COCA) (Hoadley et al., 2014Hoadley K.A.

They also performed integrative molecular subtyping with the iCluster method (Shen et al., 2009Shen R. Olshen A.B. Ladanyi M. Integrative clustering of multiple genomic data types using a joint latent variable model with application to breast and lung cancer subtype analysis.Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 2906-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) in a joint analysis of aneuploidy, DNA methylation, mRNA, and miRNA levels across 9,759 tumor samples, identifying 28 iClusters. Consistent with previous multiplatform analyses (Hoadley et al., 2014Hoadley K.A. Yau C. Wolf D.M. Cherniack A.D. Tamborero D. Ng S. Leiserson M.D. Niu B. McLellan M.D. Uzunangelov V.

We analyzed the impact of somatic mutations in the cis-expression of driver genes. We grouped samples for each gene according to whether they contained frameshift or nonsense mutations (group I), missense (group II), or no mutations (group III). This analysis shows clear upregulation of cancer driver genes affected by missense mutations and downregulation of those affected by nonsense or frameshift mutations (Figures 4C and 4D; Table S7), consistent with previous findings (Hu et al., 2017Hu Z.

Functional characterization of somatic mutations in cancer using network-based inference of protein activity.Nat. Genet. 2016; 48: 838-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We observed reduced expression for tumor suppressors, such as ATRX, BRCA1, NF1, and RB1, and elevated expression of oncogenes, like EGFR and KIT (FDR < 0.1; Figure 4E). We highlight the top 15 genes showing significant expression differences between at least two of the three groups in at least one cancer type (Figures 4F, 4G, and S2). In most cases, the frameshift/nonsense group had significantly lower mRNA than the others, consistent with the hypothesis that they induce nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) (Lindeboom et al., 2016Lindeboom R.G.

The biological functions of each cell component are controlled by a Russian-nesting-doll-like multi-level gene-regulatory hierarchy that includes transcription-factor-promoter interaction, enhancer activation, DNA methylation, microRNA-mediated regulation, translation, and post-translational modification (He and Hannon, 2004He L.

In cancer cells, such regulatory networks are often rewired by molecular aberrations that collectively lead to the cancer phenotype (Chen et al., 2015Chen H. Lin F. Xing K. He X.

For example, somatic mutations can modify the functions of both trans and cis elements in a regulatory network, thereby conferring cell behaviors related to tumorigenesis (Garraway and Lander, 2013Garraway L.A.

Using high-throughput molecular profiling techniques over large patient cohorts, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2013Weinstein J.N. Collisson E.A.

However, our information on the rewiring of gene regulatory networks in cancer is far from complete, and enhancers represent a missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle (Aran and Hellman, 2013Aran D. Hellman A. DNA methylation of transcriptional enhancers and cancer predisposition.Cell. 2013; 154: 11-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Enhancers are important non-coding DNA elements that interact spatially with their target promoters to regulate downstream genes (Schmitt et al., 2016Schmitt A.D. Hu M. Ren B. Genome-wide mapping and analysis of chromosome architecture.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). As a major category of regulatory elements in cell development, enhancers also play critical roles in the oncogenic process (Murakawa et al., 2016Murakawa Y. Yoshihara M. Kawaji H. Nishikawa M.

That hole in our understanding is due in part to the technical difficulty of applying high-throughput techniques (e.g., ChIP-seq) to investigate enhancer activity using large patient sample cohorts. The Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM) Project has generated large-scale, high-quality annotation of ∼65,000 enhancers expressed in the human genome across multiple tissues (Andersson et al., 2014Andersson R. Gebhard C. Miguel-Escalada I. Hoof I. Bornholdt J. Boyd M. Chen Y. Zhao X. Schmidl C. Suzuki T. et al.An atlas of active enhancers across human cell types and tissues.Nature. 2014; 507: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). FANTOM thus provides an alternative solution for studying enhancer activities in cancer. An inactive enhancer is usually well organized by unmodified nucleosomes, so it cannot be accessed by either transcription factors or polymerase. When an enhancer is primed for activation in response to signaling, its local chromatin is first modified (often by H3K4Me1) and becomes loose, rendering the motifs on the enhancer available to transcription factors and RNA polymerase. When the bound transcription factors fully activate the enhancer, usually with re-marked by H3K27Ac, the local chromatin is completely open, recruiting RNA polymerase to initiate transcription in both directions (Figure 1A ) (Heinz et al., 2015Heinz S.

Using the high-quality expressed enhancer annotations in the FANTOM project, we performed a pan-cancer analysis of enhancer expression using TCGA RNA-seq data on the premise that the expression of an enhancer approximately reflects its activity. We aimed to achieve the following: (1) describe the global pattern of enhancer expression in cancers; (2) understand how enhancer activation relates to other genomic aberrations and to the relevant underlying mechanisms; and (3) identify key enhancers and explore their potential clinical implications. An enhancer’s expression level has been used as an index of its activity (Cheng et al., 2015Cheng J.H. Pan D.Z. Tsai Z.T. Tsai H.K. Genome-wide analysis of enhancer RNA in gene regulation across 12 mouse tissues.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 12648Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, Natoli and Andrau, 2012Natoli G. Andrau J.C. Noncoding transcription at enhancers: general principles and functional models.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2012; 46: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The FANTOM Project annotated enhancers based on integration of chromatin modification, transcription factor binding, cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE)-seq data (Andersson et al., 2014Andersson R. Gebhard C. Miguel-Escalada I. Hoof I. Bornholdt J. Boyd M. Chen Y. Zhao X. Schmidl C. Suzuki T. et al.An atlas of active enhancers across human cell types and tissues.Nature. 2014; 507: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar), and TCGA-generated gene-expression data using RNA-seq. To ensure the quality of our analysis, we first assessed whether TCGA’s RNA-seq platform could effectively capture the transcriptional signals from the FANTOM enhancers. Through a series of filters, we identified 15,808 detectable enhancers out of ∼65,000 FANTOM-annotated enhancers with a typical length of ∼200 bp that do not overlap with other known transcribed elements, thereby avoiding potential signal contamination (Figure S1A, Table S1, and STAR Methods). We examined the chromatin status of the flanking 1-kb sequences of those enhancers using several well-established factors, including DNase hypersensitivity, p300 binding, CTCF binding, H3K27Ac, and H3K4Me1 (Heintzman et al., 2007Heintzman N.D. Stuart R.K. Hon G. Fu Y. Ching C.W. Hawkins R.D. Barrera L.O. Van Calcar S. Qu C. Ching K.A. et al.Distinct and predictive chromatin signatures of transcriptional promoters and enhancers in the human genome.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). That analysis revealed chromatin signatures that are similar to those identified by classical enhancers but are in sharp contrast to those of the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of protein-coding genes or lncRNAs. For example, H3K4Me1, a key marker that distinguishes enhancers from any other TSSs, was substantially enriched in our enhancer set but showed a clear depletion in the TSSs of protein-coding genes (Figure 1B). The observed chromatin signatures were not affected by genomic annotation (Figure S1B). Those results confirm that our set consists principally of genuine enhancers rather than other transcribed units or transcriptional noise. In the TCGA RNA-seq data on 8,928 cancer samples of 33 cancer types (Table S2), we observed a substantial number of RNA-seq reads uniquely assigned to the 15,808 enhancers. Those mapped reads showed clear peaks centered on the enhancers identified (Figure 1C). That clear pattern confirmed the biological significance of our cross-platform integration and distinguished the signals from transcriptional noise. Another potential issue in our analysis of enhancers arose from the relatively low depth of RNA-seq data (Li et al., 2016Li W. Notani D. Rosenfeld M.G. Enhancers as non-coding RNA transcription units: recent insights and future perspectives.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17: 207-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). To evaluate the general utility of TCGA RNA-seq data for enhancer expression, we determined the numbers of enhancers with detectable expression in different cancer types. On average, 4,591 enhancers were detected in > 10% of the samples in a given cancer type, suggesting that enhancer expression signals detected contain considerable sampling power to represent cancer enhancer functions on a global scale (Figure 1D and Table S3). To evaluate further the clinical significance of the enhancer expression, we assessed correlations of the expression levels with patient survival in each of the 25 cancer types that had sufficient sample size and follow-up time. That analysis identified a few dozen to thousands of prognostic enhancers per cancer type, and some of them tended to correlate with prognosis across multiple cancer types (Figures 1E, S1C, and S1D and Tables S1 and S4). Given the same sample cohorts and FDR cutoff = 0.05, we compared the proportions of enhancers and protein-coding genes that showed prognostic significance. Interestingly, in most cancer types, the fraction of enhancers with prognostic power was comparable to, or even higher than, that of protein-coding genes (Figure 1F). Finally, we examined the variation in enhancer expression across cancer types based on global enhancer expression level (summarizing over all of the enhancers surveyed, in reads per million mapped reads [RPM]). Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) showed the lowest global enhancer expression level (∼100 RPM), and thymoma (THYM) showed the highest (∼240 RPM). Within each cancer type, there was also large variation (as large as ∼5-fold) among patient samples (Figure 1G). Compared with adjacent normal tissues from the same patients, most cancer types showed global enhancer activation (paired t test, p < 0.05, for 13 cancer types that had > 10 matched tumor-normal pairs, Figure 1H). Collectively, those results present a general picture of enhancer expression in human cancers and suggest that enhancer expression signals detected from TCGA RNA-seq data represent a biological dimension of interest, complementary to other genomic features. The enhancer expression datasets presented here provide a starting point for exploration by the research community. Somatic copy-number alteration (SCNA) and point mutation are the two most common types of mutational events that impact the stability of a cancer genome. To explore the relationship between genomic instability and enhancer expression in cancer, we determined the correlations of global enhancer expression level (RPM) with the SCNA and mutation burdens in each cancer type. Specifically, for a given tumor sample, we used the aneuploidy value (defined as the fraction of the genome affected by SCNAs) from Affymetrix SNP6.0 arrays and the total number of silent somatic mutations from whole-exome sequencing to quantify the global SCNA level and mutation burden, respectively. For the majority of cancer types surveyed (19 out of 25 cancer types with ≥80 samples), the aneuploidy level showed a significantly positive correlation with the global enhancer activation level (Figure 2A ). In contrast, point mutations showed no correlation or a slight negative correlation (Figure 2B). These results indicate complex relationships between enhancer activation and different types of genomic aberrations in cancer. To explore further the global patterns of enhancer expression across cancer types, we performed consensus clustering of tumor samples using the 1,500 (∼10% of 15,808) enhancers with the highest coefficients of variation (CV) across samples (STAR Methods). Enhancer expression levels were Z-normalized within each cancer type to minimize tissue effects. The analysis resulted in three robust subtypes (clusters): C1, C2, and C3 were separated in the space of the top three principal components, and the clusters were not driven by disease type (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2). Comparison of the enhancer-based subtypes with well-established pathological subtypes further supported the biological significance of the clustering (Figures S3A and S3B). The most distinct feature among the subtypes was their differential levels of global enhancer expression: the enhancer expression levels of the three subtypes were higher than those of their normal counterparts; subtype C2 showed the highest level of enhancer activation, 1.25- or 1.15-fold higher than that of normal or C1 and C3 samples (Figure 2E). Notably, the 15% increase of global enhancer expression was a large effect, indicating > 400 more activated enhancers in C2 than in C1 and C3 samples, up to be ∼30% of the active enhancers that a tumor usually has (Figure 2F). Consistent with the associations between aneuploidy and global enhancer expression within individual cancer types, ∼25% of a typical C2 genome was affected by aneuploidy, 1.5-fold more than that of a typical C1 (16%) or C3 (15%) genome (Figure 2G), indicating thousands more genes perturbed by SCNAs. In terms of mutation burden, subtype C1 samples contained slightly more point mutations than subtype C2, and both C1 and C2 showed significantly higher mutation burdens than subtype C3 (Figure 2H). We also saw that some cancer driver genes appeared to be under strong positive selection in subtype C1 (Figures S3C and S3D). For example, C1 had a 1.5-fold higher TP53 truncation rate than did the others. The decoupling of point mutations and global enhancer activation in the above pan-cancer analysis is compatible with the patterns we observed within cancer types (Figures 2A and 2B). Taken together, the correlations of enhancer activation with genomic instability can be summarized as a tree (Figure 2I): subtype C1 was enriched with samples having high mutation load and low aneuploidy; subtype C2 was enriched with samples having high mutation load and high aneuploidy; and C3 was “normal-like,” with low mutation load and low aneuploidy. Both the analyses within cancer types and the analyses across cancer types indicate that SCNAs, but not point mutations, are positively associated with enhancer activation.Figure S3Enhancer-Based Clustering Correlate with Known Cancer Subtypes and Driver Mutations, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Global enhancer expression profile is associated with established cancer subtypes.

The above section raised a question of great interest: why do SCNAs and point mutations correlate with global enhancer activation in cancer differently (or even, to some extent, inversely in some cancer types)? Variations in chromatin organization of the human genome have been reported to be major determinants of the variation of somatic mutation rates across the genome (Schuster-Böckler and Lehner, 2012Schuster-Böckler B. Lehner B. Chromatin organization is a major influence on regional mutation rates in human cancer cells.Nature. 2012; 488: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar); low mutation rate is a feature of open DNA because of their accessibility by the DNA repair machineries (Figure 3A ) (Polak et al., 2014Polak P. Lawrence M.S. Haugen E. Stoletzki N. Stojanov P. Thurman R.E. Garraway L.A. Mirkin S. Getz G. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Sunyaev S.R. Reduced local mutation density in regulatory DNA of cancer genomes is linked to DNA repair.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, chromatin opening happens to be a prerequisite for enhancer activity (Figure 1A). Upon activation, enhancers loop to, and interact with, their target DNAs, creating topological DNA-DNA interactions (Figure 3A). Meanwhile, long-range DNA-DNA contacts physically increase the chance for loci far apart on the 1D-sequence to meet and rearrange with each other when breaks occur, generating structural alterations (Figure 3A) (Fudenberg et al., 2011Fudenberg G. Getz G. Meyerson M. Mirny L.A. High order chromatin architecture shapes the landscape of chromosomal alterations in cancer.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Those observations collectively suggest a molecular mechanism in which SCNAs and point mutations are differently associated with global enhancer activation patterns established through differences in the openness of chromatin. In that model, compact chromatin favors point mutation and keeps enhancers silent; once chromatin opens, enhancers are more likely to be activated. Meanwhile, because unfolded DNA is elongated by one to two orders of magnitudes, long-range DNA-DNA interactions are more likely to occur, which increases the chance of DNA rearrangements (SCNAs). To test that hypothetical model further, we used SCNA and mutation data from whole-genome sequencing to perform the analysis across different genomic regions, thereby providing evidence independent of that from our cross-sample analyses (Figure 3B and STAR Methods). A direct prediction of the model is that loose and compact chromatin regions in the cancer genome are dominated by SCNAs and mutations, respectively. Consistent with that prediction, in the cross-genomic-region analysis (using 1 Mb as a unit), DNA regions that featured markers of open chromatin (DNA hypersensitivity and H3K27Ac) were associated with higher rates of DNA double-strand breaks (DBSs) and lower mutation rates. Also, as predicted, the relationship between chromatin state and enhancer expression was the same as that for chromatin state and DSBs. In contrast, closed chromatin, characterized by histone methylation (H3K9Me2 and H3K9Me3), displayed a strikingly opposite pattern (Figure 3B). We also observed a significantly negative association between point mutations and enhancer activation across genomic regions (rho = −0.46, n = 2663, p < 10−16). That correlation was much stronger than those in cross-sample comparisons (only 4 out of 25 cancer types showed significant negative correlations; Figure 2B). Those differences are probably due to genome-wide SCNA and mutation burdens positively correlated across tumor samples of different disease stages (Figure S4). Further, according to the model posited here, the long-range DNA-DNA interactions (Hi-C interactions) in open chromatin should at least partially explain the coincidence of enhancer activation and SCNAs across different genomic regions. To test that possibility, we examined the 500 10-kb fragments of the human genome with the highest DSB rates. We found that ∼40% (n = 204) of them overlapped with anchors of Hi-C loops, representing a > 3-fold enrichment (p < 10−3, permutation test, Figure 3C). The same anchor regions also tended to overlap with the enhancers in our study (n = 15808; enrichment = 1.9-fold, p < 10−3; permutation test, Figure 3D). As summarized in Figure 3E, this hypothetical model provides a simple and reasonable, although tentative, explanation for differential associations of enhancer activation with SCNAs and with mutations. To elucidate the molecular functions of individual enhancers in cancer development and assess their clinical utility, it is important to identify their downstream target genes. Although new technologies like Hi-C (Jin et al., 2013Jin F. Li Y. Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Ye Z. Lee A.Y. Yen C.A. Schmitt A.D. Espinoza C.A. Ren B. A high-resolution map of the three-dimensional chromatin interactome in human cells.Nature. 2013; 503: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) have been used to infer enhancer-gene interactions at the level of chromatin blocks (Dekker et al., 2013Dekker J. Marti-Renom M.A. Mirny L.A. Exploring the three-dimensional organization of genomes: interpreting chromatin interaction data.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 390-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), computational methods that can accurately pinpoint target genes are seriously needed. Integrating enhancer and mRNA expression data, we can obtain candidate target genes of an enhancer through co-expression analysis. For a given enhancer-gene combination that is co-expressed, there are at least three possible relationship models: (1) a causal relationship, in which changes in the expression of the enhancer"

Leveraging the molecular regulation of GSCs in their niches may inform the development of novel therapeutics. Stem cells are functionally defined by their abilities to self-renew and differentiate. The dynamic balance between renewal and differentiation is determined by the collective autonomous and exogenous regulation to permit maintenance of tissues, yet avoid neoplasia. Stem cells reside in niches that provide maintenance cues, which, when lost, promote differentiation. Tumor genetics have revealed that core transforming genetic events converge on stem and progenitor cell regulatory pathways. Tumor cells harbor mutations that permit maintenance of self-renewal, but also create niches that phenocopy aspects of the stem cell niche (Gilbertson and Rich, 2007Gilbertson R.J. Rich J.N.

In addition, cell-cell contacts between GSCs and brain endothelial cells create a perivascular niche to regulate GSC stemness, migration, therapy resistance, and cellular kinetics (Sharma and Shiras, 2016Sharma A.

Pericytes are perivascular cells that support blood vessels and promote vascular maturation (Bergers and Song, 2005Bergers G. Song S. The role of pericytes in blood-vessel formation and maintenance.Neuro-oncol. 2005; 7: 452-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). GSCs give rise to pericytes to support vessel function and tumor growth (Cheng et al., 2013Cheng L. Huang Z. Zhou W. Wu Q. Donnola S. Liu J.K. Fang X. Sloan A.E. Mao Y.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) also play an important role in the microenvironment (Zhou et al., 2015Zhou W. Ke S.Q. Huang Z. Flavahan W. Fang X. Paul J. Wu L. Sloan A.E. McLendon R.E.

Both in culture and in vivo, relatively pure GSC cultures reestablish mixed populations of GSCs and DGCs, suggesting that a cellular hierarchy is beneficial to sustaining tumor growth. We previously found that GSCs secrete bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which other groups demonstrated induce differentiation (Piccirillo et al., 2006Piccirillo S.G. Reynolds B.A. Zanetti N. Lamorte G. Binda E. Broggi G. Brem H. Olivi A. Dimeco F. Vescovi A.L.

Glioma cancer stem cells secrete Gremlin1 to promote their maintenance within the tumor hierarchy.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 1085-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). GSCs protect themselves from the pro-differentiation effects of BMPs through secretion of the BMP-antagonist, GREM1, providing a molecular basis by which GSCs maintain glioblastoma hierarchies through the modulation of endogenous prodifferentiation signals (Piccirillo et al., 2006Piccirillo S.G.

Based on this background, we hypothesized that DGCs play an active role in supporting GSC tumor growth. To determine whether differentiated tumor progeny contribute to tumor growth, we performed tumor formation studies with matched GSCs and DGCs from three patient-derived models implanted in the flank to permit the sequential measurement of tumor volume. GSCs consistently formed tumors when implanted in immunocompromised mice, whereas DGCs failed to generate tumors in parallel studies (Figures S1C–S1E). Supporting a functional contribution of DGCs to tumor growth, co-transplantation of DGCs with GSCs accelerated tumor growth in the flank, as measured by tumor weight (Figures S1C–S1E). To permit continuous monitoring of tumor volume, GSCs from the patient-derived models were transduced with a constitutive luciferase reporter. Co-implantation of luciferase-labeled GSCs and matched DGCs in the flanks of immunocompromised mice increased tumor volume compared to GSCs or DGCs alone (Figures S1F-S1H). The intracranial microenvironment provides specific growth cues, prompting interrogation of the relative contributions of DGCs to tumor growth using the same three patient-derived glioblastoma models. Whereas GSCs alone showed limited tumor growth, mixed DGCs and GSCs recapitulated the growth patterns of the bulk, unsorted tumor, suggesting contribution from the DGCs (Figures 1A–1C). We ruled out that this effect was simply the nonspecific contribution of non-GSCs by substituting fibroblasts for DGCs, lacking a tumor growth advantage compared to GSCs alone (Figures 1A–1C). To determine the impact of DGCs on the survival of tumor-bearing mice, we implanted GSCs from the three patient-derived models either alone or in combination with DGCs or fibroblasts into the brains of immunocompromised mice. Consistently, co-implantation of DGCs reduced the survival of xenograft-bearing mice compared to GSCs alone or GSCs with fibroblasts (Figures 1D–1F). To confirm that the survival difference was associated with differential tumor growth, we evaluated the tumor sizes of each group, revealing a significant increase of tumor formation with co-implantation of GSCs and DGCs (Figures 1J–1L). Collectively, these results demonstrate that DGCs accelerate GSC-associated tumor growth. Based on the contributions of DGCs to tumor growth, we hypothesized that DGCs provide growth cues to GSCs. These cues could include both direct cell contact (juxtacrine) and secreted factors (paracrine). As secreted factors represent therapeutically tractable targets, we screened cytokine levels from cultured GSCs and DGCs from two models using a CytoArray assay, seeking differentially expressed targets. Matching a profile of a molecular signal from the DGC population, the neuronal growth factor, BDNF, was highly secreted by DGCs compared to the matched GSCs (Figures S2A and S2B). To validate these findings, we interrogated deposited RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from three matched pairs of GSCs and DGCs (Suvà et al., 2014Suvà M.L. Rheinbay E. Gillespie S.M. Patel A.P. Wakimoto H. Rabkin S.D. Riggi N. Chi A.S. Cahill D.P. Nahed B.V. et al.Reconstructing and reprogramming the tumor-propagating potential of glioblastoma stem-like cells.Cell. 2014; 157: 580-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) and confirmed that BDNF mRNA levels were upregulated in DGCs relative to GSCs (Figure S2C). Elevated BDNF mRNA levels suggested that differential BDNF regulation occurs at the transcriptional level, so we examined the activity of the BDNF promoter using histone 3 lysine 27 acetyl chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]) data from the same dataset (Suvà et al., 2014Suvà M.L. Rheinbay E. Gillespie S.M. Patel A.P. Wakimoto H. Rabkin S.D. Riggi N. Chi A.S. Cahill D.P. Nahed B.V. et al.Reconstructing and reprogramming the tumor-propagating potential of glioblastoma stem-like cells.Cell. 2014; 157: 580-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), confirming active chromatin differentially marking the BDNF promoter in DGCs compared to matched GSCs (Figures S2E and S2F). To directly validate these findings in our models, we quantified the relative expression levels of BDNF with qPCR during differentiation in six different GSCs models, demonstrating that differentiation sharply increased expression levels of BDNF (Figure 2A). To confirm that these mRNAs were translated into secreted protein levels, we measured secreted BDNF levels by ELISA during differentiation of three GSCs models, confirming that DGCs secrete higher levels of BDNF (Figure 2B). To rule out cell culture effects on the preferential expression of BDNF in DGCs, we performed co-immunofluorescent analysis of glioblastoma surgical specimens from three patients for BDNF and a GSC marker, SOX2. Supporting BDNF expression by DGCs, BDNF preferentially marked SOX2-negative tumor cells (Figures 2C and S3A). Although glioblastomas do not strictly follow the differentiation patterns of normal brain, differentiation markers are often increased in DGCs, leading us to perform co-immunofluorescence of BDNF with both astrocytic and oligodendroglial markers. BDNF was expressed by cells with tumors expressing these lineage markers (Figures S3C and S3D). We validated the identity of the segregated GSCs and DGCs using a panel of established stem cell markers (SOX2, MYC, and OLIG2) and differentiation markers (GFAP and MBP) (Figures S3E–S3I). Collectively, these data strongly support the preferential BDNF expression in DGCs, suggesting that BDNF may be potential molecule mechanism by which DGCs influence GSC growth. BDNF serves essential roles in neurogenesis, including the regulation of neuronal survival, growth, and differentiation, through binding to its canonical receptor, NTRK2 (Chao, 2003Chao M.V.

Sci. 2006; 361: 1545-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Based on BDNF expression from DGCs, we hypothesized that GSCs would express NTRK2 to mediate the paracrine effects of BDNF. We compared NTRK2 mRNA levels in six matched pairs of GSCs and DGCs, revealing specific upregulation in GSCs (Figure 2D). To determine if these findings were merely a reflection of the tissue-of-origin, we compared GSCs and non-malignant neural cultures derived from epilepsy surgical specimens, demonstrating elevated levels in GSCs (Figure 2E). We then leveraged in silico resources with matched RNA-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq data in three matched GSC-DGC pairs (Suvà et al., 2014Suvà M.L. Rheinbay E. Gillespie S.M. Patel A.P. Wakimoto H. Rabkin S.D. Riggi N. Chi A.S. Cahill D.P. Nahed B.V. et al.Reconstructing and reprogramming the tumor-propagating potential of glioblastoma stem-like cells.Cell. 2014; 157: 580-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), confirming preferential upregulation of NTRK2 mRNA levels associated with promoter activation in GSCs (Figures S2D and S2F). Elevated NTRK2 protein levels in GSCs relative to matched DGCs were validated by immunoblot (Figure 2F). To rule out effects of cell culture, we performed immunofluorescent staining for NTRK2 and a GSC marker, SOX2, on surgical glioblastoma specimens from three patients, revealing a strong overlap between NTRK2 and SOX2-positive tumor cells (Figures 2G and S3B). Taken together, our results demonstrate that DGCs express the BDNF ligand, whereas GSCs express the cognate receptor, supporting a possible paracrine loop. To address the potential functional significance of the reciprocal BDNF and NTRK2 expression patterns in the glioblastoma cellular hierarchy, we performed loss-of-function studies with DGCs co-implanted with luciferase-labeled GSCs in intracranial tumor growth assays. In support of the findings above, the combination of GSCs and DGCs in two glioblastoma models with DGCs transduced with a non-targeting control small hairpin RNA (shRNA) (shCONT) formed larger tumors than GSCs alone, but DGCs transduced with shRNA targeting BDNF (shBDNF) displayed a reduced acceleration of tumor growth when combined with GSCs (Figure 3A). Mice bearing xenografts of GSCs alone had the longest survival, whereas mice with GSCs in combination with shCONT-transduced DGCs had the shortest survival, and mice bearing the combination of GSCs and shBDNF-transduced DGCs had an intermediate survival (Figure 3B). Histologic evaluation of the brains of tumor-bearing mice confirmed that tumor volumes were reflected the differences in survival (Figure 3C). The efficiency of BDNF knockdown was confirmed at the mRNA level by real-time PCR (Figures S4A and S4B). The contribution of BDNF from DGCs was validated using CRISPR technology. DGCs transduced with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting BDNF (sgBDNF, Figure S4C) showed reduced stimulation of tumor growth compared to DGCs with a control sgRNA, to a level similar to GSCs alone (Figure 3D). As a result, mice bearing GSCs with sgCONT DGCs had the shortest survival, whereas GSCs alone and GSCs with sgBDNF DGCs had similar survival durations, with tumor volumes on histology reflecting the differences in survival (Figures 3E and 3F). For additional confirmation, we measured the effects of gain-of-function studies with GSCs transduced with BDNF (Figures S4D and S4E), revealing increased cellular proliferation in vitro (Figures S4F and S4G), and accelerated orthotopic tumor growth and reduced survival of tumor-bearing mice compared to vector controls (Figures 3G–3I). Collectively, these data suggest that DGCs supports GSC growth in vivo, at least in part, through BDNF-NTRK2 paracrine signaling. The maintenance of a paracrine loop between two cell types requires a feedback mechanism. We again leveraged in silico comparative RNA-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq data from matched GSCs and DGCs (Suvà et al., 2014Suvà M.L. Rheinbay E. Gillespie S.M. Patel A.P. Wakimoto H. Rabkin S.D. Riggi N. Chi A.S. Cahill D.P. Nahed B.V. et al.Reconstructing and reprogramming the tumor-propagating potential of glioblastoma stem-like cells.Cell. 2014; 157: 580-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) to identify a molecular target consistently upregulated in GSCs across models (Figures S4H and S4I). The overlap in the top target genes elevated in GSCs related to DGCs measured by both RNA-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq was limited with two proneural GSC markers (SOX2 and OLIG2) and three other genes (VGF, PMP22, and C1orf61) (Figure 4A). Among these targets, we further prioritized secreted molecules that could serve a feedback signals from the GSCs to the DGCs. We focused our attention on the neural growth factor inducible gene, VGF (nota bene, VGF is not an acronym). In responsive neurons, neurotrophins, like BDNF, induce VGF (Levi et al., 1985Levi A. Eldridge J.D. Paterson B.M. Molecular cloning of a gene sequence regulated by nerve growth factor.Science. 1985; 229: 393-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, Levi et al., 2004Levi A.

Neurobiol. 2004; 24: 517-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), so we hypothesized that BDNF might induce VGF in GSCs. We treated three primary glioblastoma-derived GSCs models with 100 ng/mL of BDNF in the absence of other growth factors over a time course, then measured VGF protein levels by immunoblot, revealing induction of VGF by BDNF (Figures 4B–4E). VGF induction of BDNF was mediated through NTRK2 activity, demonstrated by a NTRK2 inhibitor, GW441756 (Figures 4F–4H). In the nervous system, BDNF induces VGF through the PI3K-AKT pathway (Lewis et al., 2015Lewis J.E. Brameld J.M. Jethwa P.H. Neuroendocrine role for VGF.Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2015; 6: 3PubMed Google Scholar, Malberg and Monteggia, 2008Malberg J.E. Monteggia L.M. VGF, a new player in antidepressant action?.Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: pe19Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Accordingly, AKT activation increased after BDNF treatment (Figures 4B–4E). To confirm NTRK2-PI3K-AKT signaling as a mediator of BDNF-induced VGF expression, we treated three GSC models with a NTRK2 inhibitor, two PI3K inhibitors (LY294002 and Wortmannin), and mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin), revealing attenuated activation of AKT and S6, a downstream effector, and reduced VGF levels, suggesting that PI3K is an upstream regulator of VGF (Figure 4I–4Q). Collectively, these results suggest that BDNF induces VGF expression in GSCs through induction of PI3K-AKT signaling. VGF serves pleiotropic regulatory functions in normal physiology (Hunsberger et al., 2007Hunsberger J.G. Newton S.S. Bennett A.H. Duman C.H. Russell D.S. Salton S.R. Duman R.S.

Here we use optogenetics to dissect the specificity and dynamics of cortico-thalamo-cortical networks in the mouse brain. We find that cortico-thalamic (CT) neurons in prelimbic PFC project to both mediodorsal (MD) and ventromedial (VM) thalamus, where layer 5 and 6 inputs activate thalamo-cortical (TC) neurons with distinct temporal profiles. We show that TC neurons in MD and VM in turn make distinct connections in PFC, with MD preferentially and strongly activating layer 2/3 cortico-cortical (CC) neurons. Finally, we assess local connections from superficial CC to deep CT neurons, which link thalamo-cortical and cortico-thalamic networks within the PFC. Together our findings indicate that PFC strongly drives neurons in the thalamus, whereas MD and VM indirectly influence reciprocally connected neurons in the PFC, providing a mechanistic understanding of these circuits."

Long-term functionally multipotent mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), as defined by engraftment following primary and secondary transplantation, are found within a phenotypic CD34−/lowFlt3−c-Kit+Sca-1+Lineage− (CD34−KSL) bone marrow (BM) cell population (Osawa et al., 1996Osawa M.

However, even the most phenotypically “pure” HSC population remains functionally heterogeneous in terms of lineage output and self-renewal capacity (Wilson et al., 2015Wilson N.K. Kent D.G.

For example, HSCs display heterogeneity in blood reconstitution duration and are commonly resolved into short-term (ST), intermediate-term (IT), and long-term (LT) repopulating HSCs (Yamamoto et al., 2013Yamamoto R. Morita Y. Ooehara J. Hamanaka S. Onodera M. Rudolph K.L. Ema H. Nakauchi H.

HSC multipotency has been traditionally defined by neutrophil/monocyte (nm) and B/T lymphocyte (B/T) differentiation. However, without considering the contribution to erythrocytes (E) and platelets (P), such definitions only partially describe HSC multipotency. As the two most abundant and essential blood cell components, understanding E and P lineage contribution is also of significance in the development of strategies to improve clinical BM transplantation. Using clonal analysis in combination with five-blood lineage (nm, B, T, E and P) analysis, we previously determined the functional heterogeneity of the phenotypic HSC (pHSC) compartment in young mice (Yamamoto et al., 2013Yamamoto R. Morita Y. Ooehara J. Hamanaka S. Onodera M. Rudolph K.L. Ema H. Nakauchi H.

In doing so, we identified a subset of pHSCs that were functionally myeloid-restricted repopulating progenitors (MyRPs). Using paired-daughter cell analysis, we further demonstrated MyRPs could be directly generated from HSCs via a myeloid-bypass pathway through a single-cell division event. While the majority of MyRPs in young mice were ST/IT-MyRPs, a minor population was LT-MyRPs (engrafting in secondary recipients), suggesting that MyRPs may resolve into distinct subpopulations. Further evidence for this comes from an independent analysis of HSCs at five-blood-lineage resolution (Carrelha et al., 2018Carrelha J. Meng Y. Kettyle L.M. Luis T.C. Norfo R. Alcolea V.

Through using a Vwf-mCherry reporter mouse line, Carrelha et al. identified a population of potently self-renewing HSCs within the CD150+CD34−KSL population that had myeloid and lymphoid capacity (in the context of in vitro differentiation assays) but displayed P-restricted output in vivo (in primary and secondary transplantation assays). In young mice, this population of P-restricted HSCs appeared to be a minor subset of the phenotypic CD150+CD34−KSL population (just ∼2%). According to our previously defined criteria, these P-restricted HSCs would be LT-MyRPs, which we observed at similar frequencies within our own transplantation assays (Table S1). These data suggest that ST-MyRPs and LT-MyRPs must be considered as distinct populations within the pHSC compartment. Native hematopoiesis has also recently been investigated at five-blood-lineage resolution (Rodriguez-Fraticelli et al., 2018Rodriguez-Fraticelli A.E. Wolock S.L. Weinreb C.S. Panero R. Patel S.H.

Through elegant transposon-based barcoding experiments, Rodriguez-Fraticelli et al. found that pHSCs were a major source of the megakaryocyte/P lineage. These data are highly consistent with the presence of MyRPs and activity of the myeloid-bypass pathway in native hematopoiesis. Further evidence for direct differentiation of HSCs into MyRPs came from HSC cell-division counting experiments by Bernitz et al., which suggested that MyRP-like cells were generated from LT-HSCs after four symmetric self-renewal cell division events (Bernitz et al., 2016Bernitz J.M.

Dysfunction within the HSC compartment is thought to be a key mechanism underlying age-related hematopoietic perturbations (Elias et al., 2017Elias H.K. Bryder D. Park C.Y.

Commun. 2016; 7: 11075Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and megakaryocytic/erythroid-biased gene expression patterns (Rundberg Nilsson et al., 2016Rundberg Nilsson A. Soneji S. Adolfsson S. Bryder D. Pronk C.J. Human and murine hematopoietic stem cell aging is associated with functional impairments and intrinsic megakaryocytic/erythroid bias.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11: e0158369Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, most of these observations have been made using population-based methods using only three- (or four)-lineage analysis. Here, we have defined how the pHSC compartment changes during aging at five-blood-lineage resolution. From over 400 clonal transplantation experiments, we demonstrate there is a large increase in MyRP frequency with age. A modest increase in the frequency of functional HSCs within the BM was also observed. Unexpectedly, we also identified a subset of functional cells within the aged pHSC compartment that generated only myeloid (P, E, and/or nm) cells in primary recipients but displayed multipotent (P, E, nm, T, and B) output in secondary recipients. We termed this age-specific functional cell type latent-HSCs. Our clonal analysis of HSC aging therefore questions the current dogma of HSC compartment aging and current approaches to define HSC function. To directly compare HSC heterogeneity during aging, it was first important to define pHSCs regardless of age. Young and aged functional HSCs are reportedly enriched in the CD150+CD48− gate of the CD34−KSL population (Yilmaz et al., 2006Yilmaz O.H. Kiel M.J. Morrison S.J. SLAM family markers are conserved among hematopoietic stem cells from old and reconstituted mice and markedly increase their purity.Blood. 2006; 107: 924-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To purify HSCs, we used Sca-1high cells within the KSL population, since Sca-1low cells do not contain functional HSCs (Wilson et al., 2015Wilson N.K. Kent D.G. Buettner F. Shehata M. Macaulay I.C. Calero-Nieto F.J. Sánchez Castillo M. Oedekoven C.A. Diamanti E. Schulte R. et al.Combined single-cell functional and gene expression analysis resolves heterogeneity within stem cell populations.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16: 712-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). With this HSC gating strategy, 97% of the (CD34−KSL) HSC compartment in young (8- to 12-week-old) and aged (20- to 24-month-old) mice were negative for CD48 (Figure S1A). These data suggested that CD48 staining was not essential to purify functional HSCs both in young and aged mice. Consistent with previous studies (Sudo et al., 2000Sudo K. Ema H. Morita Y. Nakauchi H. Age-associated characteristics of murine hematopoietic stem cells.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1273-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), the BM frequency of the pHSC (CD34−KSL) compartment increased ∼10-fold in aged mice (Figures 1A and 1B ). We previously resolved the CD150+CD34−KSL pHSCs population in young mice into two fractions based on CD41 expression: fraction 1 (CD150+CD41−CD34−KSL) cells were enriched for functionally multipotent LT/IT-reconstituting HSCs, whereas fraction 2 (CD150+CD41+CD34−KSL) cells tended to show a myeloid-committed phenotype. By contrast, CD150−CD41−CD34−KSL (termed fraction 3) cells were predominantly ST-reconstituting HSCs. Within the pHSC compartment, the frequency of CD150+CD41−CD34−KSL (fraction 1) cells, in which most young functional HSCs are found (Yamamoto et al., 2013Yamamoto R. Morita Y. Ooehara J. Hamanaka S. Onodera M. Rudolph K.L. Ema H. Nakauchi H. Clonal analysis unveils self-renewing lineage-restricted progenitors generated directly from hematopoietic stem cells.Cell. 2013; 154: 1112-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), was significantly decreased in aged mice. By contrast, the frequency of CD150+CD41+CD34−KSL (fraction 2) was dramatically increased (20-fold) (Figures 1A and 1B), as previously reported (Gekas and Graf, 2013Gekas C. Graf T. CD41 expression marks myeloid-biased adult hematopoietic stem cells and increases with age.Blood. 2013; 121: 4463-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Smaller changes to phenotypic hematopoietic progenitor populations were also observed (Figure S1B), in line with previous reports (Elias et al., 2017Elias H.K. Bryder D. Park C.Y. Molecular mechanisms underlying lineage bias in aging hematopoiesis.Semin. Hematol. 2017; 54: 4-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To directly interrogate the functional characteristics of individual young and aged CD34−KSL cells, we performed single-cell transplantation into lethally irradiated young mice. We initially transplanted single CD34−KSL cells from young (8- to 12-week-old) and aged (20- to 24-month-old) Ly5.1 Kusabira Orange (KuO) mice (Hamanaka et al., 2013Hamanaka S. Ooehara J. Morita Y. Ema H. Takahashi S. Miyawaki A. Otsu M. Yamaguchi T. Onodera M. Nakauchi H. Generation of transgenic mouse line expressing Kusabira Orange throughout body, including erythrocytes, by random segregation of provirus method.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 435: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) into a total of 76 lethally irradiated young Ly5.2 mice, together with 2 × 105 competitor cells from Ly5.1/Ly5.2-F1 mice (Figure 1C). As we observed significant changes in CD150 and CD41 expression within the CD34−KSL population with age, we also transplanted single CD150+CD41−CD34−KSL (fraction 1), CD150+CD41+CD34−KSL (fraction 2), and CD150−CD41−CD34−KSL (fraction 3) cells from young and aged mice into a total of 370 lethally irradiated Ly5.2 young mice. We defined the 421 donor cells according to their contribution to the five peripheral blood (PB) lineages (nm, E, P, B, T) and their duration of reconstitution over 24 weeks in primary recipients, as previously defined (Yamamoto et al., 2013Yamamoto R. Morita Y. Ooehara J. Hamanaka S. Onodera M. Rudolph K.L. Ema H. Nakauchi H. Clonal analysis unveils self-renewing lineage-restricted progenitors generated directly from hematopoietic stem cells.Cell. 2013; 154: 1112-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Reconstituting cells were classified into HSC, MyRP (common myeloid repopulating progenitors [CMRP], megakaryocyte-erythroid repopulating progenitors [MERP], and megakaryocyte repopulating progenitor [MkRP]), and ”others” (reconstituting cells that did not meet HSC- or MyRP-type reconstitution criteria) (Figure S1D). To avoid missing functional cells, we set our threshold at 0.005%. However, similar results were seen if a threshold of 0.1% was used instead (Figures S1E and S1F). By combining all single-cell transplantation datasets with the frequency of fractions 1–3 in young and aged mice, we calculated the frequency of these subsets within the pHSC compartment (Figure 1E) and in total BM (Table S2). In terms of frequency within the pHSC population, HSCs decreased by half with age, MyRPs (including CMRPs, MERPs, and MkRPs) were found at similar frequencies, and undetectable cells (termed non-reconstituting cells) increased (Figure 1E). Functional composition was significantly different between young and aged pHSCs (Figure S1G; chi-square test; p < 0.05). However, when considered as a frequency of total BM cells, HSCs increased 5.2-fold, while MyRPs expanded 13-fold (Table S2). We next focused on the reconstitution kinetics of each repopulating cell type in primary recipients (Figure 2A). Repopulating cells (RCs) were classified based on duration of reconstitution capacity and designated as ST or LT/IT cells, as previously defined (Yamamoto et al., 2013Yamamoto R. Morita Y. Ooehara J. Hamanaka S. Onodera M. Rudolph K.L. Ema H. Nakauchi H. Clonal analysis unveils self-renewing lineage-restricted progenitors generated directly from hematopoietic stem cells.Cell. 2013; 154: 1112-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). As we had seen before, most LT/IT-RCs in the young pHSC compartment were functional HSCs (Figure 2B). However, in the aged pHSC compartment, more than half of the LT/IT-RCs lacked lymphoid potential (Figure 2B), corresponding with the myeloid-biased reconstitution by aged BM cells. Strikingly, LT/IT-MyRPs expanded 16-fold within the BM with age, while ST-MyRPs expanded by a more modest 7.5-fold with age (Table S3). The dramatic increase in the frequency of LT/IT-MyRPs suggests that the P-restricted (and myeloid-restricted) HSCs described by Carrelha et al., 2018Carrelha J. Meng Y. Kettyle L.M. Luis T.C. Norfo R. Alcolea V. Boukarabila H. Grasso F. Gambardella A. Grover A. et al.Hierarchically related lineage-restricted fates of multipotent haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2018; 554: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar likely expand with age. This is consistent with their suggestion that this population has potent self-renewal activity. Based on these data, we suggest renaming LT/IT-MyRPs. To distinguish them from multipotent LT-HSCs, ST-MyRPs, and progenitors (e.g., megakaryocyte progenitors [MkP], megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors [MEPs], and common myeloid progenitors [CMPs]), we suggest naming them myeloid-restricted stem cells (MySCs), which includes megakaryocyte stem cells (MkSCs), megakaryocyte-erythroid stem cells (MESCs), and common myeloid stem cells (CMSCs) (see Figure S2 for a glossary of functional cell terminology). To further resolve LT- and IT-RCs, we performed secondary transplantation assays. While it was not possible to perform secondary transplantation assays on all primary recipients, we transplanted BM from 89 primary recipients (48 with young pHSCs and 41 with aged pHSCs) into a total of 153 secondary recipients (Figure 2C). We initially considered multipotent HSC reconstitution in secondary recipients. While nm, E, P, and B engraftment were comparable between young and aged LT-HSCs, T lymphoid production was significantly decreased from aged LT-HSCs in primary and secondary recipients (Figure 2C). These data confirm that even at the level of single LT-HSCs, T-potential is reduced with age. However, it is worth noting that the loss of T output was not seen in aged IT-HSCs (as compared to young IT-HSCs). Although LT-HSCs decreased as a frequency of the pHSC compartment, we estimate the frequency within the BM increases with age 2.9-fold, from 7.3 to 21 cells per 106 BM cells (Table 1). These data suggest that multipotent LT-HSCs display modest self-renewal capacity. To more directly quantify self-renewal of young LT-HSCs, we set up single-cell secondary transplantation assays from primary recipient mice displaying a functional LT-HSC phenotype following transplantation of single CD150+CD41−CD34−KSL (fraction 1) cells (Figure S3A). As in our primary single-cell transplantation assays, we transplanted single CD150+CD41−CD34−KSL (fraction 1), CD150+CD41+CD34−KSL (fraction 2), and/or CD150−CD41−CD34−KSL (fraction 3) cells from the primary recipients into a total of 92 mice.Table 1Frequencies of Each Cell Type among Nucleated BM Cells from Secondary Transplant AssayFunctional Cell TypeYoungAgedFold IncreaseLT-HSC7.321.02.9IT-HSC5.649.99.0ST-HSC10.852.44.9LT-latent-HSC0.082.0n/aLT-CMSC0.30.0n/aIT-CMSC1.734.219.7ST-CMRP9.275.18.2LT-MESC0.30.0n/aIT-MESC0.39.127.8ST-MERP1.319.114.7LT-MkSC0.00.0n/aIT-MkSC1.220.417.1ST-MkRP6.735.15.2Other2.310.84.7Non-reconstituting cells20.3316.015.6Data presented as the estimated number of each cell type per 106 BM cells and fold increase from young to aged BM.

Latent-HSCs show LT/IT-MyRP-type reconstitution in primary recipients. Frequencies were calculated from a total of 245 young HSC transplants and 196 aged HSC transplants (excluding dead mice). From these, 94 and 36 were used for secondary transplantation, respectively.

Consistent with our previous findings, within the primary recipient, functional HSCs and MyRPs were found within fraction 1, but MyRPs were the major cell type (59.5%) and HSCs were a more minor population (19%) (Figure S3B). Notably, all MyRPs displayed ST-repopulating kinetics. Fraction 3 also contained both functional HSCs and MyRPs (22.2% and 3.7%, respectively). By contrast, the only functional fraction 2 cells were MyRPs (48%) (Figure S3C). These data suggest that single LT-HSCs can re-establish functional heterogeneity within the pHSC compartment following transplantation but with a bias toward ST-MyRP generation. To further interrogate the LT activities of MyRPs during aging, we assessed primary recipients with MyRP-type reconstitution in secondary transplantation assays. Surprisingly, aged MyRPs exhibited a phenotypic change in PB lineage output in secondary recipients; LT-RCs with myeloid-restricted reconstitution in primary recipients acquired lymphoid potential (B and/or T) in secondary recipients (Figures 3A, 3B, and S4A, and S4B). This was seen in seven of the ten primary recipients displaying a MyRP-type reconstitution, with the remaining three not displaying LT reconstitution in secondary recipients. Strikingly, two mice with a P-restricted reconstitution pattern in the primary recipients displayed all five-blood-lineage output in secondary recipients (Figure 3B). We have termed this functional population latent-HSCs, a subpopulation of functionally multipotent HSCs that only display differentiation into a limited subset of lineage potentials during 24 weeks in primary recipients. All latent-HSCs identified in this study were from the aged CD150+CD41+CD34−KSL (fraction 2) population. Such a phenotype was never detected in mice transplanted with young pHSCs, both in this study and in our previous study (a total of 409 young single pHSC transplants). By contrast, LT-repopulating MySCs were detected in young BM at low frequencies (Table 1) but were not identified in aged BM. To investigate the latent-HSC phenotype further, we compared latent-HSC BM chimerism in primary and secondary recipients with that of other HSC types (Figures 3B and S4B). Primary recipients of latent-HSCs as well as young and aged LT-HSCs contained CD34−KSL cells within the BM, which suggest that transplanted single latent-HSCs have self-renewal activity. However, immunophenotypically defined (not functionally defined) downstream hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) populations had significantly (p < 0.01) lower, or no detectable, donor chimerism (Figures 3B, S4B, and S4C). Chimerism within these HPC populations increased in the BM of secondary recipients displaying a latent-HSC phenotype. This is compatible with the output of mature blood (lymphoid) lineages in these secondary recipients. By contrast, young and aged LT-HSCs usually reconstitute BM stem and progenitor fractions in both primary and secondary recipients to the same extent (Figures 3B and S4). These data suggest that latent-HSCs proliferate (via self-renewal that expands the CD150+CD41+CD34−KSL population) but largely fail to differentiate, particularly along the lymphoid lineage, within in primary recipients. However, the mechanism underlying the latent-HSC phenotype requires further clarification in future studies. Here, we performed large-scale single-cell transplantation assays to investigate functional HSC heterogeneity during aging at five-blood-lineage resolution. Consistent with previous studies (Dykstra et al., 2011Dykstra B. Olthof S. Schreuder J. Ritsema M. de Haan G.

Ema H. Morita Y. Nakauchi H. Age-associated characteristics of murine hematopoietic stem cells.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1273-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), we observed a 10-fold increase in the BM frequency of CD34−KSL pHSCs in aged C57BL/6 mice. We found that functional LT-HSCs also expand in the BM with age, although by a more modest 2.9-fold (Table 1; Figure 3C). Similar increases were seen in the frequency of total functional HSCs (including ST-, IT-, and LT-HSCs). However, because we did not directly compete single young HSCs against single aged HSCs, we cannot draw conclusions about age-related changes to the potency of HSCs (i.e., level of donor chimerism). Several direct comparisons using bulk HSC transplantations assays have suggested that young HSCs outcompete aged HSCs (Elias et al., 2017Elias H.K. Bryder D. Park C.Y.

Mendel’s first law posits that the two alleles at a locus segregate equally during meiosis. Nevertheless, in cases of meiotic drive, genes have evolved to change the mechanics of meiosis or the survival of gametes after meiosis to increase their representation in progeny (Burt and Trivers, 2006Burt A. Trivers R.L. Genes in Conflict: The Biology of Selfish Genetic Elements. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts2006Crossref Google Scholar, Lindholm et al., 2016Lindholm A.K. Dyer K.A.

Evol. 2016; 31: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). While deviations from normal meiosis can arise as a passive outcome of translocations or differences in chromosome size (Sandler and Novitski, 1957Sandler L. Novitski E. Meiotic drive as an evolutionary force.Am. Nat. 1957; 91: 105-110Crossref Google Scholar), the term meiotic drive usually refers to highly evolved systems that require active genes. The best understood meiotic drive systems are the segregation distorter (SD) system in Drosophila and the t-haplotype in mouse. The SD system involves the interaction of a mutant form of a nuclear transport protein with a simple repetitive sequence that results in failed sperm development (Larracuente and Presgraves, 2012Larracuente A.M. Presgraves D.C. The selfish segregation distorter gene complex of Drosophila melanogaster.Genetics. 2012; 192: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), whereas the t-haplotype involves mutations in a pathway that regulates the phosphorylation of microtubules (presumably impacting the function of sperm tails) and a drive locus that ameliorates this effect (Herrmann et al., 1999Herrmann B.G. Koschorz B. Wertz K. McLaughlin K.J. Kispert A. A protein kinase encoded by the t complex responder gene causes non-mendelian inheritance.Nature. 1999; 402: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In both cases, the critical defects are not apparent until after meiosis is complete, at which point the sperm that lack meiotic drive loci fail to function normally. Similar principles have been used to engineer artificial drive systems that reduce the fitness of offspring that do not inherit the construct (Champer et al., 2016Champer J. Buchman A. Akbari O.S.

A recurring theme in these and other meiotic drive systems is the involvement of at least two genetically linked factors, a drive gene and a responder locus. The two loci cannot be recombined from each other or the system loses its potency; hence naturally occurring meiotic drive systems are often encompassed within a haplotype defined by an inversion (Burt and Trivers, 2006Burt A. Trivers R.L. Genes in Conflict: The Biology of Selfish Genetic Elements. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts2006Crossref Google Scholar). Examples of meiotic drive that directly affect the process of meiosis are relatively rare. In this category are two cases of centromere drive, where larger centromeres are presumed to exploit natural asymmetries in spindle morphology (Henikoff et al., 2001Henikoff S. Ahmad K. Malik H.S.

Centromere-associated female meiotic drive entails male fitness costs in monkeyflowers.Science. 2008; 322: 1559-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The only known example of a true meiotic drive system with linked drive and responder loci similar to SD and the t-haplotype is encoded by maize abnormal chromosome 10 (Ab10) (Rhoades, 1942Rhoades M.M. Preferential Segregation in Maize.Genetics. 1942; 27: 395-407PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of Ab10-mediated drive involves the conversion of normally inert heterochromatic regions called knobs into motile “neocentromeres” that move rapidly toward spindle poles at meiosis I and II (Rhoades and Vilkomerson, 1942Rhoades M.M. Vilkomerson H. On the anaphase movement of chromosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1942; 28: 433-436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Knobs are found on Ab10 and many other locations on other chromosomes (Figures 1B and 1C ) in maize and its wild relative teosinte (Kato, 1976Kato Y.T.A. Cytological studies of maize (Zea mays L.) and teosinte (Zea mexicana Shrader Kuntze) in relation to their origin and evolution.Mass. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1976; 635: 1-185Google Scholar). In the presence of Ab10, all knobs are actively transported along microtubule sidewalls, moving earlier and faster than centromeres (Yu et al., 1997Yu H.-G. Hiatt E.N. Chan A. Sweeney M. Dawe R.K. Neocentromere-mediated chromosome movement in maize.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) by a mechanism that does not involve any of the known centromere/kinetochore proteins (Dawe and Hiatt, 2004Dawe R.K. Hiatt E.N. Plant neocentromeres: fast, focused, and driven.Chromosome Res. 2004; 12: 655-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This suggests that Ab10 encodes one or more novel trans-acting factors that act specifically on knobs. Marcus Rhoades proposed that neocentromeres form the mechanistic basis for the observation that Ab10 is preferentially transmitted to progeny when crossed as a female (Rhoades, 1952Rhoades M.M. Preferential segregation in maize.in: Gowened J.W. Heterosis. Iowa State College Press, Ames, Iowa1952: 66-80Google Scholar). He envisioned a model whereby a crossover event must first occur in the region between the centromere and knob in a heterozygous individual so that chromosomes in meiosis I contain one knobbed and one non-knobbed sister chromatid (Figure 1D). Subsequent neocentromere activity pulls the knobs to spindle poles ahead of the centromeres (Yu et al., 1997Yu H.-G. Hiatt E.N. Chan A. Sweeney M. Dawe R.K. Neocentromere-mediated chromosome movement in maize.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), creating an outward orientation that ultimately delivers knobbed chromatids to the upper and lower cells of the linear tetrad. Because the lower cell develops into an egg during female gametogenesis, Ab10 and other knobs are preferentially segregated to progeny. Ab10 can be transmitted from the female parent at levels as high as 83% by this mechanism (Buckler et al., 1999Buckler 4th, E.S.I. Phelps-Durr T.L. Buckler C.S.K. Dawe R.K. Doebley J.F. Holtsford T.P. Meiotic drive of chromosomal knobs reshaped the maize genome.Genetics. 1999; 153: 415-426PubMed Google Scholar), as can all other knobs heterozygous in the same female parent (Dawe and Hiatt, 2004Dawe R.K. Hiatt E.N. Plant neocentromeres: fast, focused, and driven.Chromosome Res. 2004; 12: 655-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Kanizay et al., 2013aKanizay L.B. Albert P.S. Birchler J.A.

Structural heterogeneity of chromosome 10 in races of maize and teosinte.in: Freeling M. Plant Genetics. Alan R. Liss, New York1985: 1-18Google Scholar). Ab10 has therefore substantially impacted the architecture of the maize genome, both by supplying the selective force for the emergence and maintenance of knobs (Buckler et al., 1999Buckler 4th, E.S.I. Phelps-Durr T.L. Buckler C.S.K. Dawe R.K. Doebley J.F. Holtsford T.P. Meiotic drive of chromosomal knobs reshaped the maize genome.Genetics. 1999; 153: 415-426PubMed Google Scholar) and by preferentially transmitting alleles linked to knobs. Here, we used genomic approaches to identify a previously unknown ∼1 Mb region containing a cluster of at least eight tandemly arrayed copies of a specialized kinesin gene called Kinesin driver (Kindr). Two Ab10 mutants previously selected for their lack of meiotic drive proved to be stable kindr epimutants showing accumulation of new small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and increased DNA methylation. RNAi of Kindr recapitulated this phenotype, proving that Kindr is required for neocentromere activity and meiotic drive. In vitro gliding assays demonstrated that KINDR is a strong minus-end-directed motor, and immunolocalization revealed that KINDR interacts specifically with neocentromeres containing 180 bp knob repeats. Sequence analysis and dating of the Kindr complex shows it evolved in the last 12 mya but is undergoing a process of expansion and homogenization consistent with selection for multiple functional copies of the tandem array. Finally, we measured the overall impact of Kindr on the maize genome by quantifying knob repeat abundances and estimating the effect of knobs on the diversity of knob-linked alleles. Abnormal chromosome 10 differs from normal chromosome 10 (N10) by an extended long arm with four knobs (Longley, 1938Longley A.E. Chromosomes of maize from North American Indians.J. Agric. Res. 1938; 56: 177-195Google Scholar). Operationally, the extra segment is marked on the left side by a gene called R that confers kernel color. Approximately 1 cM on the right (telomere) side of R, recombination between Ab10 and N10 is blocked due to the presence of several nested inversions that include hundreds of genes from N10 (Mroczek et al., 2006Mroczek R.J. Melo J.R. Luce A.C. Hiatt E.N. Dawe R.K. The maize Ab10 meiotic drive system maps to supernumerary sequences in a large complex haplotype.Genetics. 2006; 174: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (the shared region; Figure 1A). Between R and the shared region are three small knobs containing a 360 bp knob repeat known as TR1 and a closely linked trans-acting factor that converts knobs containing TR1 repeats into neocentromeres (Hiatt et al., 2002Hiatt E.N. Kentner E.K. Dawe R.K. Independently-regulated neocentromere activity of two classes of tandem repeat arrays.Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). At the end of the chromosome is a large knob containing 180 bp knob repeats and a factor that converts knobs containing 180 bp repeats into neocentromeres (Hiatt et al., 2002Hiatt E.N. Kentner E.K. Dawe R.K. Independently-regulated neocentromere activity of two classes of tandem repeat arrays.Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both neocentromere-activating factors are sequence-specific, trans-activating only one form of knob repeat (either TR1 or 180 bp repeat) and not the other (Hiatt et al., 2002Hiatt E.N. Kentner E.K. Dawe R.K. Independently-regulated neocentromere activity of two classes of tandem repeat arrays.Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, Kanizay et al., 2013aKanizay L.B. Albert P.S. Birchler J.A. Dawe R.K. Intragenomic conflict between the two major knob repeats of maize.Genetics. 2013; 194: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, only the factor that activates neocentromeres containing 180 bp repeats is required for meiotic drive. TR1 neocentromere activity, while required to mobilize knobs that are composed entirely of TR1 repeats, is apparently dispensable for the meiotic drive of Ab10 (Mroczek et al., 2006Mroczek R.J. Melo J.R. Luce A.C. Hiatt E.N. Dawe R.K. The maize Ab10 meiotic drive system maps to supernumerary sequences in a large complex haplotype.Genetics. 2006; 174: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Numerous terminal deficiencies of Ab10 have been described (Hiatt and Dawe, 2003Hiatt E.N. Dawe R.K. Four loci on abnormal chromosome 10 contribute to meiotic drive in maize.Genetics. 2003; 164: 699-709PubMed Google Scholar, Mroczek et al., 2006Mroczek R.J. Melo J.R. Luce A.C. Hiatt E.N. Dawe R.K.

Dempsey E. Structural heterogeneity of chromosome 10 in races of maize and teosinte.in: Freeling M. Plant Genetics. Alan R. Liss, New York1985: 1-18Google Scholar). Among these is a deletion called Ab10-Df(L) that retains most of the haplotype including the large knob but is missing the terminal “distal tip” of the chromosome (Hiatt and Dawe, 2003Hiatt E.N. Dawe R.K. Four loci on abnormal chromosome 10 contribute to meiotic drive in maize.Genetics. 2003; 164: 699-709PubMed Google Scholar). Ab10-Df(L) is defective for meiotic drive (shows Mendelian segregation), indicating that at least one factor required for meiotic drive is present in the distal tip. Analysis of Ab10-Df(L) at meiosis revealed clear neocentromere activity at TR1 repeats but an absence of neocentromere activity at 180 bp repeats (Figure S1B). To identify the presumptive 180 bp neocentromere factor, we extracted mRNA from the anthers (containing meiotic cells) of plants carrying Ab10 and Ab10-Df(L). We then used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify transcripts present in Ab10 and absent in Ab10-Df(L). Primers for 31 of the most highly expressed of these transcripts were used to test whether the sequence was present in genomic DNA from Ab10 and absent in the genome of N10 and Ab10-Df(L) lines. Nine of the primer pairs fit these criteria, indicating they identify sequences from the distal tip. Eight of the transcripts have no coding capacity while the ninth is an intact kinesin-14A homolog we refer to as Kinesin driver (Kindr). The closest maize homolog of Kindr is ZmKin11 (Figure 2A), a gene previously described only by sequence (Lawrence et al., 2002Lawrence C.J. Malmberg R.L. Muszynski M.G. Dawe R.K. Maximum likelihood methods reveal conservation of function among closely related kinesin families.J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that lies on the short arm of chromosome 7. Like ZmKin11, Kindr is expressed throughout the plant, including seedlings, young ears, and anthers.Figure 2Kindr and Its MutantsShow full caption(A) Structure of Kindr.

Bars in (D)–(F) represent SE. To characterize the genomic sequence of Kindr we probed a BAC library with 4× coverage from a maize line containing Ab10 (Kanizay et al., 2013bKanizay L.B. Pyhäjärvi T. Lowry E.G. Hufford M.B. Peterson D.G. Ross-Ibarra J. Dawe R.K. Diversity and abundance of the abnormal chromosome 10 meiotic drive complex in Zea mays.Heredity (Edinb). 2013; 110: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This experiment revealed 23 BAC clones containing Kindr, six times more than expected for a single gene. The BACs were skim sequenced and placed into groups with different Kindr genes, and eight BACs chosen for full sequencing using PacBio technology. We ultimately identified eight different Kindr genes in five BAC contigs, where six are fully sequenced and two are partially sequenced (Figure 2B). Bionano optical mapping technology (Udall and Dawe, 2018Udall J.A. Dawe R.K. Is it ordered correctly? Validating genome assemblies by optical mapping.Plant Cell. 2018; 30: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was then used to orient the BAC contigs relative to each other, revealing that the eight Kindr genes are tandemly clustered in an ∼1 Mb region. The optical map also suggested the presence of a ninth copy (between Kindr-B2 and B9; Figure 2B). The genes are similar in overall structure but can be divided into four classes by SNP profiles (B2/E9/B9, B1/G11, C4/F6, and B10). RNA-seq revealed that three of the classes are expressed (see below). The Kindr-B10 gene is not expressed, most likely because there is a large (4.5 kb) Robertson’s mutator transposable element 74 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Large-scale mutant screens identified two suppressor of meiotic drive mutants (Ab10-smd1 and Ab10-smd12) that are defective for meiotic drive but retain a cytologically intact Ab10 chromosome (Dawe and Cande, 1996Dawe R.K. Cande W.Z. Induction of centromeric activity in maize by suppressor of meiotic drive 1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (STAR Methods). Ab10-smd1 and Ab10-smd12 were identified in different screens and are not related by pedigree. Cytological analysis revealed that both mutants are deficient for neocentromere activity at 180 bp repeats but retain activity for TR1 repeats similar to Ab10-Df(L) (Figures 2C and S1B). In addition, both mutants showed a dramatic loss of Kindr expression. qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA extracted from leaves and anthers of the Ab10-smd1 mutant revealed a >84% reduction in Kindr expression relative to the progenitor Ab10 line (Figure 2D). RNA-seq of the same anther mRNA revealed that the relative expression of the B2/B9/E9, B1/G11, and C4 classes were indistinguishable in the Ab10 and Ab10-smd1 lines, even though overall expression was reduced in Ab10-smd1 by 92%. In ear tissue from an early generation of Ab10-smd12 (two generations removed from its discovery), we observed ∼95% reduction of Kindr expression (Figure S1C), whereas in leaves and anthers from an Ab10-smd12 line that had been propagated for five generations, we observed a near complete absence of expression (Figures 2D and 2E). These data indicate that the Ab10-smd1 and Ab10-smd12 mutations cause uniform silencing of all the genes in the Kindr complex. To address the possibility that the reduced Kindr expression in Ab10-smd1 and Ab10-smd12 reflected structural changes in the Kindr complex, we resequenced the mutant lines and identified unique markers for each Kindr BAC contig. This analysis revealed that the entire Kindr complex was present in both mutants and that there are no apparent differences in the copy numbers of the constituent Kindr genes. We also considered whether transposon-induced mutations may have effected Kindr expression, because the genetic screens that gave rise to Ab10-smd1 and Ab10-smd12 were carried out in a background with active transposons in the Robertson’s mutator (Mu) family. However, we undertook multiple extensive searches for Mu elements using Southern blot strategies (for Ab10-smd1) and modern Mu-targeted sequencing methods (Williams-Carrier et al., 2010Williams-Carrier R. Stiffler N. Belcher S. Kroeger T. Stern D.B. Monde R.A. Coalter R. Barkan A. Use of Illumina sequencing to identify transposon insertions underlying mutant phenotypes in high-copy Mutator lines of maize.Plant J. 2010; 63: 167-177PubMed Google Scholar) for Ab10-smd1 and Ab10-smd12 and found no new Mu elements linked to these mutations. An alternative interpretation is that the multiple copies of Kindr are repressed in Ab10-smd1 and Ab10-smd12 by trans-acting silencing signals such as small RNAs (Cuerda-Gil and Slotkin, 2016Cuerda-Gil D. Slotkin R.K. Non-canonical RNA-directed DNA methylation.Nat. Plants. 2016; 2: 16163Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We addressed this possibility by sequencing small RNAs and analyzing the data on a metagene plot representing the entire Kindr complex (due to sequence similarity among Kindr genes, it is not possible to analyze each gene independently). The results revealed a peak of 24-nt siRNAs in the Ab10 progenitor ∼150 bp upstream of the Kindr transcription start site (Figures 3A, 2SA, and 2SB). This upstream peak of siRNAs is typical of active genes in maize (Gent et al., 2013Gent J.I. Ellis N.A. Guo L. Harkess A.E. Yao Y. Zhang X. Dawe R.K. CHH islands: de novo DNA methylation in near-gene chromatin regulation in maize.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 628-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, in early generation Ab10-smd12 tissue, two unusual peaks of siRNAs were observed over the promoter and first intron (Figures 3A and 3C). Similar new peaks were observed in the Ab10-smd1 mutant (Figure S2B). However, in late-generation Ab10-smd12 plants there were few if any Kindr siRNAs (Figure S2B) consistent with the lack of Kindr expression (Figures 2D and 2E).Figure S2Additional Small RNA and Methylation Data, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Size and uniqueness of siRNAs from Ab10-smd12/N10, Ab10/N10 and N10/N10.

This study aimed at analyzing mutations in cfDNA and their correlation with tissue mutations in patients with HCC. We included 8 HCC patients treated with surgical resection for whom we collected paired tissue and plasma/serum samples. We analyzed 45 specimens, including multiregional tumor tissue sampling (n = 24), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBC, n = 8), plasma (n = 8) and serum (n = 5). Ultra-deep sequencing (5500× coverage) of all exons was performed in a targeted panel of 58 genes, including frequent HCC driver genes and druggable mutations. Mutations detected in plasma included known HCC oncogenes and tumor suppressors (e.g., TERT promoter, TP53, and NTRK3) as well as a candidate druggable mutation (JAK1). This approach increased the detection rates previously reported for mutations in plasma of HCC patients. A thorough characterization of cis mutations found in plasma confirmed their tumoral origin, which provides definitive evidence of the release of HCC-derived DNA fragments into the bloodstream. This study demonstrates that ultra-deep sequencing of cfDNA is feasible and can confidently detect somatic mutations found in tissue; these data reinforce the role of plasma DNA as a promising minimally invasive tool to interrogate HCC genetics."
https://openalex.org/W2795987491,"Despite its exciting potential, chemical induction of pluripotency (CIP) efficiency remains low and the mechanisms are poorly understood. We report the development of an efficient two-step serum- and replating-free CIP protocol and the associated chromatin accessibility dynamics (CAD) by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC)-seq. CIP reorganizes the somatic genome to an intermediate state that is resolved under 2iL condition by re-closing previously opened loci prior to pluripotency acquisition with gradual opening of loci enriched with motifs for the OCT/SOX/KLF families. Bromodeoxyuridine, a critical ingredient of CIP, is responsible for both closing and opening critical loci, at least in part by preventing the opening of loci enriched with motifs for the AP1 family and facilitating the opening of loci enriched with SOX/KLF/GATA motifs. These changes differ markedly from CAD observed during Yamanaka-factor-driven reprogramming. Our study provides insights into small-molecule-based reprogramming mechanisms and reorganization of nuclear architecture associated with cell-fate decisions."

The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex (MCUC) plays a major role in mediating mitochondrial Ca2+ import, and its expression and function therefore have a marked impact on cardiac myocyte metabolism and function. Here, we investigated MCU's role in mitochondrial Ca2+ handling, mitochondrial function, glucose oxidation, and cardiac function in the heart of diabetic mice. We found that diabetic mouse hearts exhibit altered expression of MCU and MCUC members and a resulting decrease in [Ca2+]m, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, mitochondrial energetic function, and cardiac function. Adeno-associated virus-based normalization of MCU levels in these hearts restored mitochondrial Ca2+ handling, reduced PDC phosphorylation levels, and increased PDC activity. These changes were associated with cardiac metabolic reprogramming toward normal physiological glucose oxidation. This reprogramming likely contributed to the restoration of both cardiac myocyte and heart function to nondiabetic levels without any observed detrimental effects. These findings support the hypothesis that abnormal mitochondrial Ca2+ handling and its negative consequences can be ameliorated in diabetes by restoring MCU levels via adeno-associated virus–based MCU transgene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2795408138,"Mitochondrial dysfunction lies at the core of acute pancreatitis (AP). Diverse AP stimuli induce Ca2+-dependent formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), a solute channel modulated by cyclophilin D (CypD), the formation of which causes ATP depletion and necrosis. Oxidative stress reportedly triggers MPTP formation and is elevated in clinical AP, but how reactive oxygen species influence cell death is unclear. Here, we assessed potential MPTP involvement in oxidant-induced effects on pancreatic acinar cell bioenergetics and fate. H2O2 application promoted acinar cell apoptosis at low concentrations (1-10 μm), whereas higher levels (0.5-1 mm) elicited rapid necrosis. H2O2 also decreased the mitochondrial NADH/FAD+ redox ratio and ΔΨm in a concentration-dependent manner (10 μm to 1 mm H2O2), with maximal effects at 500 μm H2O2 H2O2 decreased the basal O2 consumption rate of acinar cells, with no alteration of ATP turnover at <50 μm H2O2 However, higher H2O2 levels (≥50 μm) diminished spare respiratory capacity and ATP turnover, and bioenergetic collapse, ATP depletion, and cell death ensued. Menadione exerted detrimental bioenergetic effects similar to those of H2O2, which were inhibited by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Oxidant-induced bioenergetic changes, loss of ΔΨm, and cell death were not ameliorated by genetic deletion of CypD or by its acute inhibition with cyclosporine A. These results indicate that oxidative stress alters mitochondrial bioenergetics and modifies pancreatic acinar cell death. A shift from apoptosis to necrosis appears to be associated with decreased mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity and ATP production, effects that are independent of CypD-sensitive MPTP formation."

Methods Based on the sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2014 to 2015, we analyzed the HGS data of 7,969 South Koreans. Individuals with specific chronic diseases and who reported poor subjective health status were excluded to ensure a healthy population sample. Means with standard deviations (SDs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each 5-year interval starting from 10 years of age. To determine the relationship between HGS and anthropometric variables, we performed correlation analyses between HGS and height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Additionally, based on these findings, the cut-off value for low HGS was presented by deriving -2SD values of healthy young adults as recommended by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People. Results The mean age and BMI of men and women were 38.3 and 38.2 years and 23.8 and 22.4 kg/m2, respectively. Mean HGS of the dominant hand in men and women was 39.5 and 24.2 kg, respectively. The peak in HGS was at 35–39 years of age, after which HGS decreased in both sexes. HGS was significantly correlated with height, weight, and BMI. The cut-off values for weak HGS were < 28.9 and < 16.8 kg in men and women, respectively. Conclusion These results provide useful reference values to assess HGS in patients who undergo hand surgery or who have various diseases that affect HGS. Moreover, a cut-off value for low HGS may help in defining sarcopenia among the Korean population."

Herein, we analyzed risk factors and prognosis in invasive infections caused by KP versus EC, in an area with low antimicrobial resistance. Moreover, we compared antimicrobial resistance and relative prevalence of KP and EC (KP/EC-ratio) in different European countries, using EARS-Net data. Adult patients admitted to Karolinska University Hospital 2006–2012 with invasive infection caused by KP (n = 599) were matched regarding sex and age with patients infected by EC. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Comorbidity was adjusted for with multivariable analysis. European data were retrieved from the EARS-Net database. No differences were observed in 7- and 30-day mortality between the groups. The 90-day mortality was significantly higher in the KP cohort (26% versus 17%, p<0.001), but not after adjusting for comorbidity. Malignancy was seen in 53% of the patients with KP versus 38% with EC, OR 1.86 (1.34–2.58). A significant increase in the rate of ESBL-production was observed in EC, but not in KP. The KP/EC-ratio remained stable. In contrast, European data showed increasing percentages of isolates non-susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins in EC and KP, and increasing KP/EC-ratio. Invasive infection caused by KP is a disease affecting patients with high comorbidity and associated with high 90-d mortality. The stable KP/EC-ratio and low occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in data from Karolinska University Hospital compared to aggregate data from 20 EARS-Net countries could be related to absence of clonal spread of multidrug-resistant KP."

These findings show how the intrinsic functional and structural architecture of the amygdala, and amygdala-medial prefrontal pathways, which have previously been implicated in anxiety, are linked to individual differences in risk tolerance during economic decision making. To make adaptive choices, decision makers must integrate their beliefs about the possible outcomes of each action with their evaluation of those possible outcomes. However, one challenge that decision makers confront is that there is often uncertainty about what outcomes will result from a given action. A particular form of uncertainty, when information about the probability of each possible outcome is known, is referred to as “risk” (von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1994von Neumann J. Morgenstern O. Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. Princeton University Press, 1994Google Scholar). Examples of risk include the outcomes of a fair coin toss, die roll, or roulette wheel. An individual’s risk tolerance (also referred to as “risk attitude” or “risk preference”), their willingness to accept risk in order to gain a greater expected return, can be measured by assessing preferences between small-but-certain and larger-but-risky rewards (Glimcher, 2008Glimcher P.W.

Furthermore, neural activity, particularly in the NAcc, mPFC, and aINS, predicts the choice that the individual will make (Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005Kuhnen C.M. Knutson B.

There is recent interest, though, in moving beyond predicting choice from simultaneously measured task-evoked brain activation, toward predicting behavior at greater remove, by testing whether task-independent measures of brain structure and function, from anatomical or resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) or diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI), can predict decision-making tendencies (Fumagalli, 2014Fumagalli R.

Neural markers of individual differences in decision-making.Curr. Opin. Behav. Sci. 2015; 5: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For instance, increased gray matter volume (GMV) in the right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC) is associated with increased risk tolerance (Gilaie-Dotan et al., 2014Gilaie-Dotan S. Tymula A. Cooper N. Kable J.W. Glimcher P.W. Levy I. Neuroanatomy predicts individual risk attitudes.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 12394-12401Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, Grubb et al., 2016Grubb M.A. Tymula A. Gilaie-Dotan S. Glimcher P.W. Levy I. Neuroanatomy accounts for age-related changes in risk preferences.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13822Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Examining multiple neuroimaging modalities together, however, may provide an even better understanding of the complex interplay among brain structure and function and behavior. In a recent example, the preference for positively skewed gambles (lotteries that yield large amounts with small chances) was associated with the coherence (fractional anisotropy [FA]) of the white matter (WM) tract connecting aINS and NAcc (Leong et al., 2016Leong J.K. Pestilli F. Wu C.C. Samanez-Larkin G.R. Knutson B. White-Matter Tract Connecting Anterior Insula to Nucleus Accumbens Correlates with Reduced Preference for Positively Skewed Gambles.Neuron. 2016; 89: 63-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and activity in the NAcc during choice mediated the link between tract structure and choice behavior. To our knowledge, there have been no similar multimodal imaging investigations of neural markers for basic risk tolerances; identifying such markers is the goal of the present study. We therefore examined how individual differences in risk tolerance are linked with individual variations in intrinsic functional and structural brain signatures, including resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), GMV, and WM fiber tract strength, using multimodal, task-independent, brain imaging data in a large sample of healthy young adults (n = 108). We first identified associations between an individual’s risk tolerance and different brain region’s node strength, a graph-theoretical measure of the centrality of a region calculated from RS-fMRI (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010Rubinov M. Sporns O. Complex network measures of brain connectivity: uses and interpretations.Neuroimage. 2010; 52: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (6873) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2010Wang J. Zuo X. He Y. Graph-based network analysis of resting-state functional MRI.Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 16PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis highlighted the bilateral amygdalae, structures previously linked to aspects of risky decision making. To further characterize this association, we tested how RSFC to the amygdala was associated with risk tolerance using seed-based connectivity analysis, which found an association between amygdala-medial prefrontal connectivity and risk tolerance. We then identified further associations between amygdala structure (i.e., GMV) and amygdala-medial prefrontal structural connectivity (i.e., WM tract strength) and risk tolerance. Each of the identified features (structure, structural connectivity, and functional connectivity) explains unique variance in risk tolerance. This series of results identifies a coherent set of relationships between risk tolerances and multiple intrinsic functional and structural features of the amygdala and its connections with medial prefrontal cortex. Risk tolerances were assessed using a well-validated task (Figure 1A; Kable et al., 2017Kable J.W. Caulfield M.K. Falcone M. McConnell M. Bernardo L. Parthasarathi T. Cooper N. Ashare R. Audrain-McGovern J. Hornik R. et al.No effect of commercial cognitive training on brain activity, choice behavior, or cognitive performance.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 7390-7402Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). One hundred and eight participants (age [mean ± SD], 24.36 ± 4.69 years old; 44 females; risk tolerance α, 0.69 ± 0.31) made 120 binary choices between a certain gain of $20 and a larger-risky reward that varied from trial to trial (Figure 1B). We modeled the subjective value (SV) for each option using the functional form for expected utility. In our case, SV = p × Aα, where p and A are the reward probability and amount of winning, respectively, since there is always a 1−p chance of receiving nothing. α is the risk tolerance parameter; larger α values mean increased risk tolerance (see STAR Methods for a detailed explanation). We first tested whether risk tolerance was associated with node strength, a graph theoretic measure of the importance or centrality of a region in the resting-state functional connectivity network. Using a standard whole-brain parcellation, we calculated node strength of each parcel in the RS-fMRI dataset. The node strengths of left and right amygdalae had the highest correlation with risk tolerance (left amygdala, r = 0.265, p = 0.007; right amygdala, r = 0.261, p = 0.007; Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C ). Greater amygdala node strength was associated with higher risk tolerance. Though these effects survived a false-positive adjustment used in previous studies of network measures (Lynall et al., 2010Lynall M.E. Bassett D.S. Kerwin R. McKenna P.J. Kitzbichler M. Muller U. Bullmore E. Functional connectivity and brain networks in schizophrenia.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 9477-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, Cocchi et al., 2012Cocchi L. Bramati I.E. Zalesky A. Furukawa E. Fontenelle L.F. Moll J. Tripp G. Mattos P. Altered functional brain connectivity in a non-clinical sample of young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 17753-17761Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), they did not survive Bonferonni correction. Nonetheless, the fact that the strongest relationship between node strength and risk tolerance was in the amygdala led us to focus on the amygdala in subsequent analyses. Though node strength gives an overall measure of connectivity, it does not provide anatomic specificity regarding the most important connections driving the association with risk tolerance. We next performed whole-brain seed-based (i.e., seed-to-voxel-based) connectivity analysis to further examine the relationship between amygdala RSFC and risk tolerance. There was significant positive correlation between risk tolerance and RSFC between the left amygdala and mPFC dorsally in the ACC (mPFC/ACC; peak MNI x, y, z coordinate = 3, 9, 27; peak z value = 3.68) and between risk tolerance and RSFC between the right amygdala and mPFC ventrally along the gyrus rectus (mPFC/rectus; x, y, z = −6, 9, −15; z value = 3.73; cluster-forming height threshold of p < 0.001, uncorrected, corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster extent threshold of p < 0.05; Figure 3). The areas of mPFC identified by their connectivity to the left and right amygdala seeds overlapped at a height threshold of p < 0.005 (uncorrected) and cluster size correction to p < 0.05 for multiple comparisons across the whole brain (Figure 3). Greater amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity was associated with higher risk tolerance. Next, based on our RSFC results described above, we examined whether risk tolerance was also associated with structural connectivity between the amygdala and mPFC. We defined mPFC targets from the above seed-based RSFC results and performed probabilistic tractography using diffusion imaging data (Figure 4A). The tracts between the amygdala and the mPFC coursed medially through ventral striatal regions, consistent with findings from previous probabilistic tractography studies (Croxson et al., 2005Croxson P.L. Johansen-Berg H. Behrens T.E. Robson M.D. Pinsk M.A. Gross C.G. Richter W. Richter M.C. Kastner S. Rushworth M.F.

The tract strength between right amygdala and mPFC/rectus was significantly negatively correlated with risk tolerance (r = −0.279, p = 0.004; Figure 4C). The tract strength between left amygdala and mPFC/ACC was also negatively correlated with risk tolerance (r = −0.140, p = 0.155; Figure 4D), though this relationship was not significant. Thus, greater right amygdala-mPFC tract strength was associated with lower risk tolerance. There was an inverse relationship between WM tract strength and RSFC. The tract strength between right amygdala and mPFC/rectus exhibited a non-significant negative correlation with RSFC strength between these two regions (r = −0.177, p = 0.070), while the tract strength between left amygdala and mPFC/ACC exhibited a significant negative correlation with RSFC strength between these two regions (r = −0.292, p = 0.002). We confirmed that the laterality of the structural connectivity effect was not due to using different target ROIs for each hemisphere. The reconstructed WM tract between amygdala and frontal cortex is particularly strong to the ventral part of mPFC (i.e., medial orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]), and the target ROI (mPFC/rectus) defined by RSFC for right amygdala is more ventrally located than that (mPFC/ACC) for left amygdala. To address this issue, we conducted additional analyses using symmetric anatomical ROIs for ventral mPFC, defined according to Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template labels (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002Tzourio-Mazoyer N. Landeau B. Papathanassiou D. Crivello F. Etard O. Delcroix N. Mazoyer B. Joliot M. Automated anatomical labeling of activations in SPM using a macroscopic anatomical parcellation of the MNI MRI single-subject brain.Neuroimage. 2002; 15: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (11604) Google Scholar), including both medial OFC and rectus. This analysis confirmed that risk tolerance had a significant association with only the tract strength between right amygdala and ventral mPFC (r = −0.242, p = 0.013 for right hemisphere; r = −0.132, p = 0.179 for left hemisphere). We then examined the relationship between risk tolerance and amygdala structure. Amygdala GMV in each hemisphere was significantly positively correlated with risk tolerance (left amygdala, r = 0.343, p = 0.0004; right amygdala, r = 0.270, p = 0.0057; Figure 5). Greater amygdala GMV was associated with higher risk tolerance. One potential concern is that we may have pursued a different set of connectivity analyses, leading to a different set of findings, had we examined the different imaging modalities in a different order. Reassuringly, though, a whole-brain analysis of GMV also highlights the amygdala, further justifying our focus above on amygdala structural and functional connectivity. A whole-brain analysis revealed that GMV in bilateral amygdalae had the strongest associations with risk tolerance, in the same way that the node strengths of bilateral amygdalae had the strongest associations with risk tolerance (Figure S1). Therefore, regardless of data modality we initially use for data-driven analyses, individuals’ risk tolerance has a stronger association with the functional and structural features of amygdala than with any other brain region. Given previous reports of a positive relationship between risk tolerance and GMV in the right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC) (Gilaie-Dotan et al., 2014Gilaie-Dotan S. Tymula A. Cooper N. Kable J.W.

Consistent with previous studies, this ROI analysis revealed a positive association between rPPC GMV and risk tolerance (r = 0.174, p = 0.078), though this relationship was not significant in our data. Next, we confirmed that none of our results depend on the specific functional form of risk tolerance that we used. We regressed each of the amygdala features above against (1) risk aversion parameters from two forms of risk-return/mean-variance model, an alternative to the expected utility model (Markowitz, 1959Markowitz H.M. Portfolio Selection: Efficient Diversification of Investments. John Wiley & Sons, 1959Google Scholar, Weber et al., 2004Weber E.U. Shafir S. Blais A.R.

Rev. 2004; 111: 430-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and (2) the percentage of risky choices, as a model-free estimate of risk attitudes. There was a strong correspondence between the risk tolerances estimated from the expected utility model and both the risk aversion parameters estimated from the risk-return models (r = −0.93 and −0.92 for the classic and Weber formulations of risk-return) and the overall percentage of risky choices (r = 0.92). Not surprisingly given this correspondence, all of the amygdala features identified above were also significantly correlated with both the risk aversion parameters from the risk-return models and the overall percentage of risky choices (Table 1).Table 1Summary of Regression Analyses between Each of Brain Measures and Alternative Risk EstimatesExpected Utility ModelThe Percentages (%) of Participants’ ChoicesMean-Variance Modelrisk tolerance% of risky choices over all probability% of risky choices on small probabilities% of risky choices on intermediate probabilities% of risky choices on large probabilitiesMarkowitz’s risk-return parameterWeber’s risk-return parameterAssociation with the node strength of amygdalaLeft hemispherer = 0.265, p = 0.007∗r = 0.256, p = 0.009∗r = 0.154, p = 0.118r = 0.256, p = 0.009∗r = 0.135, p = 0.173r = −0.226, p = 0.021∗r = −0.270, p = 0.006∗Right hemispherer = 0.261, p = 0.007∗r = 0.262, p = 0.007∗r = 0.176, p = 0.073r = 0.266, p = 0.006∗r = 0.119, p = 0.230r = −0.227, p = 0.021∗r = −0.270, p = 0.006∗Association with functional connectivity between amygdala and MPFCLeft hemispherer = 0.434, p < 0.001∗r = 0.406, p < 0.001∗r = 0.249, p = 0.011∗r = 0.423, p < 0.001∗r = 0.171, p = 0.083r = −0.397, p < 0.001∗r = −0.392, p < 0.001∗Right hemispherer = 0.424, p < 0.001∗r = 0.414, p < 0.001∗r = 0.316, p = 0.001∗r = 0.400, p < 0.001∗r = 0.213, p = 0.030∗r = −0.367, p < 0.001∗r = −0.336, p < 0.001∗Association with white matter tract strength between amygdala and MPFCLeft hemispherer = −0.140, p = 0.155r = −0.082, p = 0.406r = −0.170, p = 0.084r = −0.140, p = 0.153r = 0.197, p = 0.044∗r = 0.147, p = 0.135r = 0.108, p = 0.271Right hemispherer = −0.278, p = 0.004∗r = −0.238, p = 0.015∗r = −0.209, p = 0.033∗r = −0.290, p = 0.003∗r = 0.049, p = 0.617r = 0.234, p = 0.016∗r = 0.260, p = 0.007∗Association with GMV in amygdalaLeft hemispherer = 0.343, p = 0.001∗r = 0.269, p = 0.006∗r = 0.298, p = 0.002∗r = 0.268, p = 0.006∗r = 0.054, p = 0.586r = −0.323, p = 0.001∗r = −0.309, p = 0.001∗Right hemispherer = 0.270, p = 0.006∗r = 0.182, p = 0.065r = 0.237, p = 0.015∗r = 0.187, p = 0.058r = 0.001, p = 0.994r = −0.224, p = 0.022∗r = −0.225, p = 0.022∗∗p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab ∗p < 0.05. Finally, we examined whether these various measures of functional connectivity, structural connectivity, and structure each explain independent or overlapping variance in risk tolerance. We did this by performing a linear regression analysis including all of the functional and structural features of the amygdala for a given hemisphere to explain risk tolerance. Of note, significant features in such a model explain variance in risk tolerances over and above that explained by all other features. This is because the t-statistic for a given independent variable in a multiple regression is proportional to the correlation between the dependent variable and that portion of the independent variable that is uncorrelated with the remaining independent variables (Cohen et al., 2003Cohen J. Cohen P. West S.G. Aiken L.S. Applied Multiple Regression/Correlation Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences.Third Edition. Lawrence Erlbaum, 2003Google Scholar). In a regression analysis for the left hemisphere, RSFC strength and relative GMV (i.e., absolute GMV divided by total intracranial volume) of the left amygdala were significant predictors of risk tolerance (p < 0.05; Table 2). In a regression analysis for the right hemisphere, RSFC strength, relative GMV, and tract strength of the right amygdala were significant predictors for risk tolerance (p < 0.05; Table 2). These regressions show that each of these different measures account for unique variance in risk tolerances.Table 2Summary of Linear Regression Models with Each of the Measures Individually and TogetherModel with Only Node StrengthModel with Only RSFCModel with Only GMVModel with Only Tract StrengthModel with All Brain VariablesModel for left amygdalaConstant−8.79E-12 (0.017)−2.21E-10 (0.016)6.280E-12 (0.016)−9.26E-12 (0.017)−2.04E-10 (0.015)Node strength0.008 (0.003)∗∗–––−0.001 (0.003)RSFC–0.652 (0.131)∗∗∗––0.645 (166)∗∗∗GMV––1.678 (0.487)∗∗–1.552 (0.446)∗∗Tract strength–––−0.141 (0.097)−0.003 (0.089)R20.070.1880.1010.020.274Model for right amygdalaConstant−1.03E-11 (0.017)1.070E-11 (0.016)6.762E-11 (0.017)−4.51E-08 (0.017)−3.25E-08 (0.015)Node strength0.008 (0.003)∗∗–––0.004 (0.003)RSFC–0.719 (0.147)∗∗∗––0.537 (0.163)∗∗GMV––1.384 (0.510)∗∗–1.087 (0.462)∗Tract strength–––−0.296 (0.099) ∗∗−0.214 (0.092)∗R20.0650.1830.0650.0770.273Data are given as unstandardized coefficients, B (standard errors).

https://openalex.org/W2796023029,"Top-down attention is crucial for meaningful behaviors and impaired in various mental disorders. However, its underpinning regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. We demonstrate that the hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony associates with levels of top-down attention. Both attention and synchrony are reduced in mutant mice of ErbB4, a receptor of neuregulin-1. We used chemical genetic and optogenetic approaches to inactivate ErbB4 kinase and ErbB4+ interneurons, respectively, both of which reduce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity. Such inhibitions in the hippocampus impair both hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony and top-down attention, whereas those in the prefrontal cortex alter attention, but not synchrony. These observations identify a role of ErbB4-dependent GABA activity in the hippocampus in synchronizing the hippocampal-prefrontal pathway and demonstrate that acute, dynamic ErbB4 signaling is required to command top-down attention. Because both neuregulin-1 and ErbB4 are susceptibility genes of schizophrenia and major depression, our study contributes to a better understanding of these disorders. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2795471900,"Stem cell-specific transcriptional networks are well known to control pluripotency, but constitutive cellular processes such as mRNA splicing and protein synthesis can add complex layers of regulation with poorly understood effects on cell-fate decisions. Here, we show that the RNA binding protein HTATSF1 controls embryonic stem cell differentiation by regulating multiple aspects of RNA processing during ribosome biogenesis. HTATSF1, in a complex with splicing factor SF3B1, controls intron removal from ribosomal protein transcripts and regulates ribosomal RNA transcription and processing, thereby controlling 60S ribosomal abundance and protein synthesis. HTATSF1-dependent protein synthesis is essential for naive pre-implantation epiblast to transition into post-implantation epiblast, a stage with transiently low protein synthesis, and further differentiation toward neuroectoderm. Together, these results identify coordinated regulation of ribosomal RNA and protein synthesis by HTATSF1 and show that this essential mechanism controls protein synthesis during early mammalian embryogenesis."

Plasmodium spp., the causative agent of malaria, contains a mitochondrion that is very divergent from that of their hosts. The malarial mitochondrion is a clinically validated target for the antimalarial drug atovaquone, which specifically blocks the electron transfer activity of the bc1 complex of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mtETC). Most mtETC proteins are nuclear-encoded and imported from the cytosol, but three key protein subunits are encoded in the Plasmodium mitochondrial genome: cyt b, COXI, and COXIII. They are translated inside the mitochondrion by mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes). Here, we characterize the function of one large mitoribosomal protein in Plasmodium falciparum, PfmRPL13. We found that PfmRPL13 localizes to the parasite mitochondrion and is refractory to genetic knockout. Ablation of PfmRPL13 using a conditional knockdown system (TetR-DOZI-aptamer) caused a series of adverse events in the parasite, including mtETC deficiency, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and death. The PfmRPL13 knockdown parasite also became hypersensitive to proguanil, a drug proposed to target an alternative process for maintaining Δψm. Surprisingly, transmission EM revealed that PfmRPL13 disruption also resulted in an unusually elongated and branched mitochondrion. The growth arrest of the knockdown parasite could be rescued with a second copy of PfmRPL13, but not by supplementation with decylubiquinone or addition of a yeast dihydroorotate dehydrogenase gene.

The role of disordered ribosomal protein extensions in the early steps of eubacterial 50S ribosomal subunit assembly.Int. J. Mol.

Here, for the first time, we provide direct evidence that PfmRPL13 is essential for malaria parasites, highlighting the significance of mitoribosomes for parasite physiology and survival. PF3D7_0214200 (designated as PfmRPL13) is annotated as the putative mitochondrial ribosomal protein L13 in P. falciparum (www.plasmodb.org) 3Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site.

To compare the sequence similarity (or divergence) of mitochondrial ribosomal L13 proteins from various organisms, we performed a multiple sequence alignment and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis. As shown in Fig. S1, PfmRPL13 is closely related to its orthologues in other apicomplexan parasites, but shares much less sequence similarity to other mitoribosomal L13 proteins. PfmRPL13 and Toxoplasma mRPL13 share 55% identical residues, but the percent identity between the P. falciparum and human proteins is 23%, as calculated from the alignment (Fig. S1A). As might be expected then, in the phylogenetic results the apicomplexan mRPL13s form a separate, well-supported clade within the overall mitochondrial L13 grouping (Fig. S1B). To verify the subcellular localization of PfmRPL13 in P. falciparum, we integrated a copy of PfmRPL13 tagged with triple HA (3HA) or GFP into the genome of Dd2attB parasites (28Nkrumah L.J. Muhle R.A. Moura P.A. Ghosh P. Hatfull G.F. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Fidock D.A. Efficient site-specific integration in Plasmodium falciparum chromosomes mediated by mycobacteriophage Bxb1 integrase.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3 (16862136): 615-62110.1038/nmeth904Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Dd2attB transfected with the pLN-PfmRPL13-GFP construct grew very slowly and did not express GFP, as determined by fluorescence microscopy and Western blotting (data not shown), suggesting that expression of the PfmRPL13-GFP fusion protein was silenced by some unknown mechanism(s). However, Dd2attB transfected with the pLN-PfmRPL13-3HA construct expressed PfmRPL13-3HA. Immunofluorescence assay showed that PfmRPL13-3HA was localized in the parasite mitochondria with almost no signal in other cellular compartments (Fig. 1). Importantly, Dd2attB-PfmRPL13-3HA grew normally as compared with the parental line (data not shown). Based on its evolutionary sequence conservation (29Smits P. Smeitink J.A. van den Heuvel L.P.

TetR-DOZI-RLuc-Bsd is the combined gene for a fusion protein of tetracycline repressor with development of zygote inhibited (DOZI), followed by Renilla luciferase and blasticidin deaminase. 8xapt stands for 8 copies of TetR-binding aptamers. 5′HR and 3′HR are upstream and downstream homologous regions of the PfmRPL13 gene. The green box next to 5′HR indicates shield mutations that keep amino acid sequences intact but change nucleotide sequences to avoid repetitive cutting by Cas9. The dark blue box next to the green box is the 3HA tag. The template plasmid was fully digested with EcoRV before electroporation. Two gRNAs (**) adjacent to the stop codon of PfmRPL13 were cloned into the pAIO plasmid individually. The black bars underneath WT and integrated gene models indicate exons of the gene whereas dashed lines indicate the introns. B, the genotype of the PfmRPL13 knockdown line was verified by diagnostic PCR analysis. D10 genomic DNA served as a control. The sequences of primers P1–P4 are shown in Table S1 and their approximate positions are marked in (A). Lanes 1, 4, and 7 are products from PCR reactions with template DNA from the D10-PfmRPL13-KD line; lanes 2, 5, and 8 with DNA from D10 WT; lanes 3, 6, and 9 are no DNA controls. In lane 7, the fragment to be amplified was too big to work in PCR (>11 kb). C, a representative growth curve of the PfmRPL13 knockdown line grown in the presence or absence of aTc (250 nm). Cultures were split 1:5 on days 2, 4, 6, and 8. Parasitemia was determined under a light microscope by counting more than 1000 red blood cells in each Giemsa-stained thin blood smear. Growth index is the cumulative -fold expansion which is the multiplication of parasitemia and split factors over the time course. A split factor is 5 in a 1:5 split.

Transfections in these lines were performed with circular or linearized template plasmids along with pUF1-Cas9 and selected with either a single drug for the template plasmid or two drugs for both the template and Cas9 plasmids (“Materials and methods”). In cultures transfected with a circular template plasmid, negative selection against maintenance of the plasmid was also performed (“Materials and methods”). However, despite multiple attempts, gene knockout was unsuccessful (data not shown). Because it has been shown that the only essential role of the mtETC in asexual blood stages is to provide an electron sink for the parasite dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), which is essential for pyrimidine biosynthesis (23Painter H.J. Morrisey J.M. Mather M.W. Vaidya A.B. Specific role of mitochondrial electron transport in blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum.Nature. 2007; 446 (17330044): 88-9110.1038/nature05572Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that PfmRPL13 might be dispensable in the yeast DHODH (yDHODH) transgenic parasites, which do not require a functional mtETC. Knockout approaches as described above were carried out in the NF54attB-yDHODH-GFP line which carries a fusion protein of yDHODH and GFP. Gene knockout in this line was not successful after many attempts, however. In summary, PfmRPL13 is refractory to gene disruption, suggesting that PfmRPL13 is likely to be essential. Because our knockout studies were unable to definitely determine the essentiality of PfmRPL13 in the parasites, we utilized a recently developed translational knockdown approach, the TetR-DOZI-aptamer system (30Ganesan S.M. Falla A. Goldfless S.J. Nasamu A.S. Niles J.C. Synthetic RNA-protein modules integrated with native translation mechanisms to control gene expression in malaria parasites.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (26925876): 1072710.1038/ncomms10727Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this system, protein translation is conditionally regulated by addition of anhydrotetracycline (aTc) (ON) or withdrawal of aTc (OFF). As shown in Fig. 2A, the TetR-DOZI-aptamer system was inserted into the genomic locus by double crossover recombination facilitated by CRISPR/Cas9 (“Materials and methods”). We transfected D10 WT parasites with a linearized template vector and two circular guider RNA (gRNA) constructs (“Materials and methods”), selected with blasticidin and aTc, and obtained transgenic parasites 3 weeks post electroporation. As shown in Fig. 2B, the genomic locus of PfmRPL13 was confirmed to be correctly modified in the transgenic parasites by diagnostic PCR analysis. We named this line D10-PfmRPL13-KD (knockdown). It has been shown that protein knockdown efficiency in the TetR-DOZI-aptamer system is determined by aptamer copy number, but aptamers are not very stable (31Spillman N.J. Beck J.R. Ganesan S.M. Niles J.C. Goldberg D.E. The chaperonin TRiC forms an oligomeric complex in the malaria parasite cytosol.Cell Microbiol. 2017; 19 (28067475): 1271910.1111/cmi.12719Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To delineate aptamer copy numbers in D10-PfmRPL13-KD, the PCR product of 5′ integration (lane 1 in Fig. 2B) was sequenced and all 8 aptamer copies were intact (data not shown). The expression of PfmRPL13 was then controlled by addition and removal of aTc in the culture. To rule out any possibility that aTc itself would interfere with parasite growth, the WT D10 line was exposed to media supplemented with aTc (250 nm) and no aTc for 2 weeks but no differences between the two were noticed (data not shown), suggesting that aTc did not alter parasite growth. To determine the effect of knocking down PfmRPL13 on parasite survival, D10-PfmRPL13-KD parasites grown under aTc were enriched by a Percoll gradient, washed thoroughly, and exposed to medium with or without aTc (250 nm) for several intraerythrocytic developmental cycles (IDCs) (“Materials and methods”). As shown in Fig. 2C, D10-PfmRPL13-KD exhibited a severe growth arrest when aTc was removed for three cycles or more. When aTc was removed for more than four cycles, the parasitemia dropped down to a negligible level. To assess parasite growth long term, the aTc-minus culture of D10-PfmRPL13-KD was maintained up to 1 month (split weekly), and growth arrest was maintained for the entire period (data not shown). In the first two cycles post aTc removal, however, the differences between aTc-plus and aTc-minus cultures were not significant under microscopic examination. We then compared their growth rates through [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation assays by titrating aTc in a serial dilution (“Materials and methods”). As shown in Fig. S2, in the first cycle, D10-PfmRPL13-KD incorporated similar levels of [3H]hypoxanthine in low and high concentrations of aTc; however, in the second cycle, the knockdown parasite grown at the lowest aTc concentration (0.24 nm) had a 40% reduction in [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation compared with that of a high aTc (250 nm) culture. In thin blood smears, morphologically deteriorating parasites were observed when aTc was removed for two cycles and the number of morphologically unhealthy parasites increased substantially after removal of aTc for three or more cycles (Fig. S3). To determine PfmRPL13 expression levels in the knockdown parasites, a knockdown assay was set up using the same protocol as described above. Protein samples were collected every 2 days over four IDCs and examined by Western blotting (“Materials and methods”). As shown in Fig. 2D, PfmRPL13 expression was substantially diminished after aTc was removed for just one cycle. We then qualitatively monitored Δψm using MitoTracker in the knockdown parasites maintained with or without aTc (“Materials and methods”). As shown in Fig. 2E, a healthy mitochondrion in a late trophozoite has a tubular structure with MitoTracker staining largely confined to the organelle (Tubular, top panel), whereas a sick parasite was unable to constrain MitoTracker staining to the mitochondrion, and it diffused throughout the cytosol (Diffused, bottom panel). We quantified the percentages of Tubular (healthy) versus Diffused (sick) MitoTracker staining patterns in the PfmRPL13 knockdown parasites over four IDCs. As shown in Fig. 2F, D10-PfmRPL13-KD parasites grown with aTc continuously present maintained healthy mitochondria, with very few parasites showing a diffused pattern. However, when aTc was removed, the percentage of parasites with diffused staining in the PfmRPL13 knockdown parasites increased dramatically in the third and fourth cycles. These data suggest that PfmRPL13 and, hence, functional mitoribosomes were critical to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential and parasite health. Taken together, our data strongly imply that PfmRPL13 is essential for parasite growth and survival in the asexual blood stages of P. falciparum. In addition, our results agree with the recent genome-wide gene disruption study carried out in the rodent parasite, which revealed the essentiality of mitochondrial ribosomal protein L13 in P. berghei (32Bushell E. Gomes A.R. Sanderson T. Anar B. Girling G. Herd C. Metcalf T. Modrzynska K. Schwach F. Martin R.E. Mather M.W. McFadden G.I. Parts L. Rutledge G.G. Vaidya A.B. Wengelnik K. Rayner J.C. Billker O.

Because the mtETC is the recipient of the three proteins translated by mitoribosomes in malaria parasites, it is critical to evaluate the function of the mtETC in the PfmRPL13 knockdown parasites. To do that, we directly measured the bc1 complex enzymatic activity in vitro by an assay measuring its ability to reduce oxidized cyt c (a model of Q cycle (33Hunte C. Palsdottir H. Trumpower B.L.

We isolated mitochondria from D10-PfmRPL13-KD parasites maintained under aTc continuously and in the absence of aTc for two cycles and four cycles (“Materials and methods”).

To characterize transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes in HSCs during development, we leveraged high-throughput genomic approaches to profile miRNAs, lincRNAs, and mRNAs. Our findings indicate that HSCs manifest distinct alternative splicing patterns in key hematopoietic regulators. Detailed analysis of the splicing dynamics and function of one such regulator, HMGA2, identified an alternative isoform that escapes miRNA-mediated targeting. We further identified the splicing kinase CLK3 that, by regulating HMGA2 splicing, preserves HMGA2 function in the setting of an increase in let-7 miRNA levels, delineating how CLK3 and HMGA2 form a functional axis that influences HSC properties during development. Collectively, our study highlights molecular mechanisms by which alternative splicing and miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation impact the molecular identity and stage-specific developmental features of human HSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2795817700,"Elucidation of the neural correlates of time perception constitutes an important research topic in cognitive neuroscience. The focus to date has been on durations in the millisecond to seconds range, but here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine brain functional connectivity during much longer durations (i.e., 15 min). For this purpose, we conducted an initial exploratory experiment followed by a confirmatory experiment. Our results showed that those participants who overestimated time exhibited lower activity of beta (18–30 Hz) at several electrode sites. Furthermore, graph theoretical analysis indicated significant differences in the beta range (15–30 Hz) between those that overestimated and underestimated time. Participants who underestimated time showed higher clustering coefficient compared to those that overestimated time. We discuss our results in terms of two aspects. FFT results, as a linear approach, are discussed within localized/dedicated models (i.e., scalar timing model). Second, non-localized properties of psychological interval timing (as emphasized by intrinsic models) are addressed and discussed based on results derived from graph theory. Results suggested that although beta amplitude in central regions (related to activity of BG-thalamocortical pathway as a dedicated module) is important in relation to timing mechanisms, the properties of functional activity of brain networks; such as the segregation of beta network, are also crucial for time perception. These results may suggest subjective time may be created by vector units instead of scalar ticks."
https://openalex.org/W2796302334,"The single most frequent cancer-causing mutation across all heterotrimeric G proteins is R201C in Gαs. The current model explaining the gain-of-function activity of the R201 mutations is through the loss of GTPase activity and resulting inability to switch off to the GDP state. Here, we find that the R201C mutation can bypass the need for GTP binding by directly activating GDP-bound Gαs through stabilization of an intramolecular hydrogen bond network. Having found that a gain-of-function mutation can convert GDP into an activator, we postulated that a reciprocal mutation might disrupt the normal role of GTP. Indeed, we found R228C, a loss-of-function mutation in Gαs that causes pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHP-Ia), compromised the adenylyl cyclase-activating activity of Gαs bound to a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog. These findings show that disease-causing mutations in Gαs can subvert the canonical roles of GDP and GTP, providing new insights into the regulation mechanism of G proteins."

Likewise, Fe-S clusters exhibited varying half-lives, depending on the carriers they were bound to; an NfuA-bound Fe-S cluster was more stable (t½ = 100 min) than those bound to SufA (t½ = 55 min), ErpA (t½ = 54 min), or IscA (t½ = 45 min). Surprisingly, the presence of NfuA further enhanced stability of the ErpA-bound cluster to t½ = 90 min. Using genetic and plasmon surface resonance analyses, we showed that NfuA and ErpA interacted directly with client proteins, whereas IscA or SufA did not. Moreover, NfuA and ErpA interacted with one another.

Fe-S cluster biogenesis proceeds in two steps, assembly and delivery. The former takes place on a scaffold protein, which allows sulfur and iron to meet and combine in an Fe-S cluster. Sulfur is produced via the catalytic degradation of l-cysteine by cysteine desulfurase, whereas the molecular source of iron remains elusive. The delivery relies on a series of Fe-S carriers that transport scaffold-bound clusters to the apo-clients. Numerous Fe-S carriers have been identified in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

A-type carrier(s) reactive oxygen species isopentenylphosphate surface plasmon resonance nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid mevalonate amino acids Luria–Bertani. Understanding how Fe-S clusters are delivered to the large number of functionally and structurally diverse Fe-S cluster proteins is a challenging task. Indeed, in most organisms, clients are actually a set of structurally and functionally diverse protein species, and it is difficult to think of a common maturation pathway shared by all of them. Moreover, Fe-S clusters are highly sensitive to environmental changes and, in particular, can be destabilized by reactive oxygen species (ROS), depending upon their solvent accessibility on the host protein (34Flint D.H.

Last, Fe-S clusters arise under different structure (i.e. 2Fe-2S, 3Fe-4S, or 4Fe-4S) or in more complex association with other metal and cofactors (1Beinert H. Iron-sulfur proteins: ancient structures, still full of surprises.J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5 (10766431): 2-1510.1007/s007750050002Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). How organisms keep on inserting clusters in such a great diversity of substrates and conditions and whether all Fe-S proteins get their clusters delivered by the same set of factors is a daunting issue. Multiple parameters can be foreseen as controlling the delivery process: (i) genetically controlled level of delivery factors available in a given condition, (ii) affinity between delivery factors and apo-targets, and (iii) intrinsic biochemical features of delivery factors. Our previous study had illustrated how genetic regulation orchestrated the choice of routes Fe-S clusters take to reach essential enzymes, IspG/H, and the two transcriptional factors, IscR and NsrR, throughout fluctuating conditions (16Vinella D. Brochier-Armanet C. Loiseau L. Talla E. Barras F.

The present study provides key findings on the two other parameters and provides us with an unprecedented view of Fe-S cluster trafficking and delivery. We investigated the intrinsic capacity of IscA, SufA, ErpA, and NfuA to stabilize bound Fe-S cluster exposed to aerobic conditions. We proceeded by analyzing the contribution of each of them to the maturation of a series of Fe-S enzymes, including IspG and IspH, two essential Fe-S enzymes involved in the production of isoprenoids (38Wolff M.

Soc. 2004; 126 (15469281): 12847-1285510.1021/ja0471727Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This provided us for the first time with a direct ranking of the Fe-S cluster carriers according to their intrinsic capacity to resist ROS potential damages. Another key finding was the observation of a privileged partnership between ErpA and NfuA, providing the cell with a new type of “hybrid” carrier, whose Fe-S cluster exhibited the highest level of resistance to ROS. Altogether, this allowed us to propose a model of the Fe-S cluster delivery network that predicts ErpA to be in charge of the maturation of most if not all Fe-S enzymes. Its closer association with NfuA appears as a new strategy for the cell to meet with transiently occurring destabilizing conditions. Earlier, we found that growth of the E. coli ΔnfuA mutant on rich medium is severely affected in the presence of paraquat, a superoxide radical generator (25Angelini S. Gerez C. Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Fontecave M. Barras F. Py B. NfuA, a new factor required for maturing Fe/S proteins in Escherichia coli under oxidative stress and iron starvation conditions.J.

Our previous analysis informed us that such a phenotype is probably due to an insufficient amount of isopentenylphosphate (IPP), due to a poor maturation of IspG and IspH, two Fe-S cluster–containing enzymes (17Loiseau L. Gerez C. Bekker M. Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Py B. Sanakis Y. Teixeira de Mattos J. Fontecave M. Barras F. ErpA, an iron sulfur (Fe S) protein of the A-type essential for respiratory metabolism in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Therefore, we tested whether the NfuA protein contributes to the Fe-S cluster delivery route toward maturation of IspG/H. For this, we introduced the eukaryotic IPP biosynthesis (Fe-S)–independent pathway, referred to as the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, in the ΔnfuA mutant and found that ectopic expression of this pathway was sufficient to rescue viability of the nfuA mutant (Fig. 1). This result indicated that NfuA is required for Fe-S cluster delivery to IspG/H under oxidative stress. To know whether NfuA cooperates with the ATC, we tested the interaction of NfuA with the ATC using the bacterial two-hybrid system. NfuA/ErpA interaction was observed as the BTH101 cells synthesizing the T18-NfuA and T25-ErpA hybrid proteins (pT18-NfuA and pT25-ErpA) exhibited β-gal activity (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no interaction was indicated between NfuA and IscA or between NfuA and SufA using this assay (Fig. 2A). ErpA/NfuA interaction was also tested by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using apoproteins. Purified NfuA was immobilized onto a Biacore sensor CM5 chip, and ErpA was serially diluted and injected. The calculated dissociation constant (Kd) of the ErpA/NfuA interaction was determined to be 48.5 ± 0.5 μm (Fig. 2B). In contrast, no interaction was observed between NfuA and SufA or IscA (data not shown). Taken together, these analyses revealed that NfuA and ErpA physically interact with each other and suggest that they might partner to form a discrete path within the Fe-S cluster delivery network. To test whether Fe-S cluster transfer occurs between ErpA and NfuA, an in vitro test was used. Holo-NfuA contains a 4Fe-4S cluster per dimer, and ErpA is able to bind a 2Fe-2S cluster per monomer (17Loiseau L. Gerez C. Bekker M. Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Py B. Sanakis Y. Teixeira de Mattos J.

His-tagged holo-NfuA (1.2 ± 0.1 iron and 1 ± 0.2 sulfur/monomer; inset of Fig. 3A) was incubated, under anaerobic conditions, with one equivalent of untagged apo-ErpA, for 1 h. After separation by chromatography onto a Ni-NTA column, iron and sulfide contents of each protein were analyzed. ErpA contained 1 ± 0.1 iron and 0.7 ± 0.2 sulfur/monomer, and its visible spectrum was characteristic of a 2Fe-2S cluster protein with absorption bands at 420 and 320 nm. On the contrary, NfuA had lost its 420-nm Fe-S cluster absorption band and contained less than 0.1 iron and sulfur/monomer (Fig. 3A). In a separate experiment, holo-ErpA was incubated with apo-NfuA, and the two entities were submitted to the same analyses as described above after separation. No modification either in iron/sulfide content or in spectrum was observed before and after co-incubation (Fig. 3B). Together, these analyses showed that, in vitro, a unidirectional Fe-S cluster transfer occurs from NfuA to ErpA. In vivo studies showed that ErpA and NfuA are required for Fe-S cluster transfer under aerobiosis and oxidative stress, respectively. Therefore, we tested the stability of Fe-S clusters bound to NfuA and to ErpA when exposed to O2. Before exposure to O2, reconstituted holo-NfuA contained 1.4 ± 0.2 iron molecules per monomer and displayed a 4Fe-4S cluster-characteristic UV-visible spectrum in agreement with published data (40Py B.

The degradation of the Fe-S cluster was monitored by the absorbance variation at 420 nm as a function of time when diluted into oxygenated buffer containing a controlled amount of O2. Under these conditions, the half-life of the NfuA Fe-S cluster was 100 ± 10 min (Fig. 4A). Holo-ErpA exhibited a 2Fe-2S cluster-characteristic UV-visible spectrum (Fig. 4B). Upon controlled O2 exposure, half-life of its cluster was 54 ± 4 min (Fig. 4B). We also tested the stability of the Fe-S cluster of two other ATC, IscA and SufA, under the same experimental conditions and found half-lives of 45 ± 3 and 55 ± 7 min, respectively (Fig. 4C). All together, these results showed that Fe-S clusters bound to diverse carriers exhibit different capacities to resist oxidative damage with the following decreasing stability order: NfuA > ErpA = SufA > IscA. Last, we tested whether stability of the ErpA bound Fe-S cluster was modified in the presence of NfuA. Both apo-NfuA and holo-ErpA proteins were mixed and exposed to O2, as above. Half-life of the Fe-S cluster bound to ErpA reached 90 ± 6 min (i.e. an enhancement by 2-fold as compared with Fe-S bound to ErpA alone) (Fig. 5). Thus, our results indicated that the presence of NfuA led to increased stability of the ErpA-bound Fe-S cluster toward O2. SPR was used to test the interaction between IspG/H and the Fe-S carriers. For the experiments performed with IspG, serially diluted IspG was injected into sensor chips coated with NfuA or with ErpA. The sensorgrams showed binding of IspG to both NfuA and ErpA (Fig. 6). Global evaluation using the 1:1 Langmuir binding model yielded Kd values of 22.5 ± 0.5 μm for the IspG/ErpA interaction and of 30 ± 2 μm for the IspG/NfuA interaction. For the experiments performed with IspH, serially diluted NfuA or ErpA was injected into IspH-coated sensor chips. Although sensorgrams showed binding of NfuA and ErpA to IspH, the maximum response, was unattainable, preventing determination of a Kd value (data not shown). We also used a bacterial two-hybrid approach to detect interactions between NfuA, ErpA, and IspH. We showed that the BTH101 cells synthesizing T18-IspH and T25-NfuA hybrid proteins exhibited β-gal activity, indicating an IspH/NfuA interaction (Fig. 7A). In addition, the two-hybrid system allowed us to show that the N-terminal domain of NfuA was sufficient to mediate the interaction with IspH (Fig. 7B). An interaction, albeit weak, was also observed between IspH and ErpA (Fig. 7A). In contrast, no interaction was observed between IspH and SufA or IscA (Fig. 7A). Collectively, these results indicated that NfuA and ErpA are able to interact directly with the client IspG and IspH proteins. Our previous study revealed a role of NfuA in the maturation of AcnB and the respiratory complex I (Fig. S1) (40Py B. Gerez C. Angelini S. Planel R. Vinella D. Loiseau L. Talla E. Brochier-Armanet C.

We then asked whether ErpA participates in the maturation of these Fe-S cluster-containing proteins. First, we assayed the AcnB activity in the conditional mutant in which the expression of the erpA gene was under arabinose induction and glucose repression referred to as LL401 (arap::erpA), in which the ΔacnA mutation has been introduced (BP721) (17Loiseau L.

https://openalex.org/W2795940571,"Outbreaks of novel highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been reported in poultry species in the United States since 2014. These outbreaks have proven the limitations of biosecurity control programs, and new tools are needed to reinforce the current avian influenza control arsenal. Some enzootic countries have implemented inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in their control programs, but there are serious concerns that a long-term use of IIV without eradication may result in the selection of novel antigenically divergent strains. A broadly protective vaccine is needed, such as live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). We showed in our previous studies that pc4-LAIV (a variant that encodes a C-terminally truncated NS1 protein) can provide significant protection against heterologous challenge virus in chickens vaccinated at 2–4 weeks of age through upregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The current study was conducted to compare the performances of pc4-LAIV and IIV in young chickens vaccinated at 1 day of age. A single dose of pc4-LAIV was able to induce stronger innate and mucosal IgA responses and protect young immunologically immature chickens better than a single dose of IIV. Most importantly, when 1-day-old chickens were intranasally primed with pc4-LAIV and subcutaneously boosted with IIV three weeks later, they showed a rapid, robust, and highly cross-reactive serum antibody response and a high level of mucosal IgA antibody response. This vaccination regimen warrants further optimization to increase its range of protection."

Immobilization by a cervical collar to protect the patient from secondary damage is a standard procedure in trauma patients. If the application of a cervical collar to a patient with an unstable craniocervical condition may cause segmental motion and secondary injury to the spinal cord is unknown. The aim of the current study is (i) to analyze compression on the dural sac and (ii) to determine relative motion of the cervical spine during the procedure of applying a cervical collar in case of ligamentous unstable craniocervical junction. Methods and findings Ligamentous AOD as well as AOD combined with ligamentous AAI was simulated in two newly developed cadaveric trauma models. Compression of the dural sac and segmental angulation in the upper cervical spine were measured on video fluoroscopy after myelography during the application of a cervical collar. Furthermore, overall three-dimensional motion of the cervical spine was measured by a motion tracking system. In six cadavers each, the two new trauma models on AOD and AOD combined with AAI could be implemented. Mean dural sac compression was significantly increased to -1.1 mm (-1.3 to -0.7 mm) in case of AOD and -1.2 mm (-1.6 to -0.6 mm) in the combined model of AOD and AAI. Furthermore, there is a significant increased angulation at the C0/C1 level in the AOD model. Immense three-dimensional movement up to 22.9° of cervical spine flexion was documented during the procedure. Conclusion The current study pointed out that applying a cervical collar in general will cause immense three-dimensional movement. In case of unstable craniocervical junction, this leads to a dural sac compression and thus to possible damage to the spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2795555459,"Connexin-43 (Cx43, also known as GJA1) is the most ubiquitously expressed connexin isoform in mammalian tissues. It forms intercellular gap junction (GJ) channels, enabling adjacent cells to communicate both electrically and metabolically. Cx43 is a short-lived protein which can be quickly degraded by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal, endolysosomal, and autophagosomal pathways. Here, we report that the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) interacts with and deubiquitinates Cx43. USP8 reduces both multiple monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination of Cx43 to prevent autophagy-mediated degradation. Consistently, knockdown of USP8 results in decreased Cx43 protein levels in cultured cells and suppresses intercellular communication, revealed by the dye transfer assay. In human breast cancer specimens, the expression levels of USP8 and Cx43 proteins are positively correlated. Taken together, these results identified USP8 as a crucial and bona fide deubiquitinating enzyme involved in autophagy-mediated degradation of Cx43."

LRP6-dependent Arg methylation was regulated on >500 proteins; only 21 exhibited increased monomethylation (MMA) with concomitant reductions in dimethylation. G3BP1, a known regulator of arteriosclerosis, exhibited a >30-fold increase in MMA in its C-terminal domain. Co-transfection studies confirm that G3BP1 (G3BP is Ras-GAP SH3 domain–binding protein) methylation is inhibited by LRP6 and that G3BP1 stimulates NFATc4 transcription. NFATc4 association with VSM osteopontin (OPN) and alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) chromatin was increased with LRP6 deficiency and reduced with G3BP1 deficiency. G3BP1 activation of NFATc4 mapped to G3BP1 domains supporting interactions with RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene I), a stimulus for mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) that drives cardiovascular calcification in humans when mutated in Singleton-Merten syndrome (SGMRT2).

https://openalex.org/W2796115510,"Studies conducted during the past few years have confirmed active West Nile virus (WNV) circulation in Serbia. Based on these studies and the epidemiological situation, the Veterinary Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection launched national WNV surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015. The programmes encompassed the territory of Serbia and were conducted by the veterinary service in collaboration with entomologists and ornithologists. The objective of the programmes was early detection of WNV and timely reporting to the public health service and local authorities to increase both clinical and mosquito control preparedness. The WNV surveillance programmes were based on direct and indirect surveillance of the presence of WNV by the serological testing of initially seronegative sentinel horses and chickens as well as through viral detection in pooled mosquito and wild bird samples. The most intense WNV circulation was observed in all seven districts of Vojvodina Province (northern Serbia) and Belgrade City, where most of the positive samples were detected among sentinel animals, mosquitoes and wild birds. The West Nile virus surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015 showed satisfactory results in their capacity to indicate the spatial distribution of the risk for humans and their sensitivity to early detect viral circulation at the enzootic level. Most of the human cases were preceded by the detection of WNV circulation as part of the surveillance programmes. According to the existing data, it can be reasonably assumed that WNV infection, now an endemic infection in Serbia, will continue to present a significant problem for the veterinary service and public health."

The harmful effects of succination suggest that this process is more than just a symptom of mitochondrial stress or dysfunction in chronic diseases but that succination actually contributes to the pathogenesis of disease complications. In support of this, recent studies suggest that succination is the mechanistic link between mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum complications in diabetes (23Manuel A.M. Walla M.D. Faccenda A. Martin S.L. Tanis R.M. Piroli G.G. Adam J. Kantor B. Mutus B. Townsend D.M. Frizzell N. Succination of protein disulfide isomerase links mitochondrial stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the adipocyte during diabetes.Antioxid.

Much research has focused on targets of succination and the role of succination in disease but not on the metabolism of 2SC after it forms. No metabolic disposal route for 2SC has yet been demonstrated. Here, we present biochemical and genetic analyses showing that Bacillus subtilis has a breakdown pathway that is specific for 2SC. These analyses implicate the yxe operon in 2SC breakdown, show that the pathway begins with acetylation and ends with deacetylation, and confirm that 2SC is toxic. We first tested whether Escherichia coli or B. subtilis can utilize 2SC as the sulfur source. 2SC served as an excellent sulfur source for B. subtilis but not E. coli (Fig. S1). A cysteine auxotroph of B. subtilis (ΔyrhA ΔcysK) (24Hullo M.F. Auger S. Soutourina O. Barzu O. Yvon M. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. Conversion of methionine to cysteine in Bacillus subtilis and its regulation.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189 (17056751): 187-19710.1128/JB.01273-06Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) also grew well on 2SC (Fig. S2), demonstrating that B. subtilis can metabolize 2SC to cysteine. To identify the gene(s) required to metabolize 2SC, we used a high-throughput screen with a B. subtilis library containing ∼7.3 × 104 unique magellan6x transposon insertions (i.e. Tn-seq) (25Johnson C.M. Grossman A.D. Identification of host genes that affect acquisition of an integrative and conjugative element in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 93 (25069588): 1284-130110.1111/mmi.12736PubMed Google Scholar). The initial transposon-mutant population was grown for six generations on defined medium containing 2SC, sulfate, or methionine as the sulfur source. Afterward, the transposon insertion sites were sequenced, allowing us to map the location and relative frequency of each transposon insertion for each experiment. If a gene is important for growth on one particular sulfur source, then the relative frequency of transposon insertions located within that gene will decrease in the population grown on that sulfur source relative to the others. Different transposon insertions can result in varying degrees of gene silencing, so a gene may still contain transposons even if it is essential under a certain growth condition. Sulfate- or methionine-grown populations served as both controls and comparisons for the 2SC-grown population. As expected, nearly every gene involved in cysteine and methionine synthesis was essential when grown on sulfate but not when grown on methionine (Fig. S3). Because B. subtilis can metabolize 2SC to cysteine (Fig. S2), growing cells on 2SC is functionally equivalent to growing cells on cysteine. Accordingly, genes involved in the conversion of cysteine to methionine were essential when grown on 2SC (Fig. S3). Observing the expected trends in the different sulfur-source populations validated the screening procedure. The only genes that significantly affected fitness in the 2SC-grown population but not in either sulfate- or methionine-grown populations were genes of the yxe operon (Fig. 2), particularly yxeK and yxeL. The yxe operon consists of seven genes that encode a predicted FAD-dependent monooxygenase, yxeK; an acetyltransferase, yxeL; three components of an ATP-transporter complex, yxeMNO; an N-acetylcysteine deacetylase, yxeP; and a putative dehydratase, yxeQ. No specific role for the yxe operon has been ascribed, but there is evidence that the acetyltransferase yxeL and N-acetylcysteine deacetylase yxeP may participate in the degradation of S-methylcysteine, and they have been named snaB and sndB, respectively (26Chan C.M. Danchin A. Marlière P. Sekowska A. Paralogous metabolism: S-alkyl-cysteine degradation in Bacillus subtilis.Environ.

The yxe operon is widely distributed in bacteria, occurring in firmicutes and α-, β-, and γ-proteobacteria (Fig. S4). E. coli lacks both the yxe operon and the ability to use 2SC as a sulfur source (Fig. S2). A priori, it is reasonable to predict that the yxe operon plays a role in 2SC metabolism. Because Tn-seq indicated that yxe operon genes play a role in 2SC metabolism, we obtained a BKE knockout mutant (27Koo B.M. Kritikos G. Farelli J.D. Todor H. Tong K. Kimsey H. Wapinski I.

Deletants of the monooxygenase yxeK and the acetyltransferase yxeL were severely limited in their ability to grow on 2SC with only a slight trace of growth observed for either mutant (Fig. 3A). In contrast, no obvious growth defect was observed for the other yxe gene deletants (Fig. 3A). The acetyltransferase YxeL has a homolog in B. subtilis, SnaA, that is reported to acetylate certain S-alkylcysteine adducts such as S-methylcysteine (26Chan C.M. Danchin A. Marlière P. Sekowska A. Paralogous metabolism: S-alkyl-cysteine degradation in Bacillus subtilis.Environ. Microbiol. 2014; 16 (23944997): 101-11710.1111/1462-2920.12210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An snaA deletant grew well on 2SC; however, a mutant lacking both acetyltransferase genes yxeL and snaA showed no sign of growth on 2SC (Fig. 3B), indicating that an acetylation step is critical for 2SC metabolism and that snaA can partially compensate for yxeL deficiency. Besides yxeP, B. subtilis has two other functionally redundant N-acetylcysteine deacetylase genes, sndA and sndC (26Chan C.M. Danchin A. Marlière P. Sekowska A. Paralogous metabolism: S-alkyl-cysteine degradation in Bacillus subtilis.Environ. Microbiol. 2014; 16 (23944997): 101-11710.1111/1462-2920.12210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As was observed for the yxeP deletant, mutants of sndA and sndC grew well on 2SC. However, a mutant lacking all three deacetylase genes did not grow on 2SC (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that a pathway to metabolize 2SC to cysteine involves acetylation and deacetylation steps, similar to a proposed pathway for the degradation of other S-alkylcysteine adducts (26Chan C.M. Danchin A. Marlière P. Sekowska A. Paralogous metabolism: S-alkyl-cysteine degradation in Bacillus subtilis.Environ. Microbiol. 2014; 16 (23944997): 101-11710.1111/1462-2920.12210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Three monooxygenase genes, cmoO, cmoI, and cmoJ, have all been reported to be essential for the degradation of S-methylcysteine and other S-alkylcysteine adducts (26Chan C.M. Danchin A. Marlière P. Sekowska A. Paralogous metabolism: S-alkyl-cysteine degradation in Bacillus subtilis.Environ. Microbiol. 2014; 16 (23944997): 101-11710.1111/1462-2920.12210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mutants of each of these genes grew well on 2SC (Fig. 3C), indicating that, apart from the acetylation and deacetylation steps, the breakdown of 2SC requires distinct genes from that of S-methylcysteine. Tn-seq and growth experiments indicate that the acetyltransferase gene yxeL is important for 2SC metabolism, but growth tests show that snaA may partially compensate for yxeL. To test their relative ability to acetylate 2SC, we purified heterologously expressed YxeL and SnaA proteins and assayed their 2SC N-acetyltransferase activity. YxeL could acetylate essentially all the 2SC present in the assay mixture, indicating that it acts on both diastereomers of 2SC, which should be present in equimolar amounts (1Schmidt T.J. Ak M. Mrowietz U. Reactivity of dimethyl fumarate and methylhydrogen fumarate towards glutathione and N-acetyl-L-cysteine—preparation of S-substituted thiosuccinic acid esters.Bioorg. Med.

The Km for YxeL is in the low micromolar range, which is more than 50-fold lower than that for SnaA (Table 1). The turnover number for YxeL is more than 250-fold higher than that for SnaA, making YxeL about 13,000-fold more catalytically efficient (Table 1). This fits with the Tn-seq and growth data that indicate that yxeL is far more important than snaA for 2SC metabolism. These kinetic parameters are consistent with 2SC being a physiological substrate for YxeL.Table 1Kinetic properties of recombinant YxeL and SnaA proteinsProteinKmKcatKcat/Kmμms−1mm−1·s−1YxeL86.4 ± 1.69.5 ± 0.6110SnaA4380 ± 2400.037 ± 0.0010.0084 Open table in a new tab YxeL is a highly efficient 2SC N-acetyltransferase and catalyzes a critical step in 2SC metabolism. Acetylation of toxic or unwanted compounds is a common strategy used by bacteria (28Limsuwun K. Jones P.G. Spermidine acetyltransferase is required to prevent spermidine toxicity at low temperatures in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182 (10986239): 5373-538010.1128/JB.182.19.5373-5380.2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that YxeL alleviates 2SC toxicity. To assess this, we tested whether 2SC inhibits growth of a B. subtilis yxeL mutant. Wildtype (WT) or yxeL deletant cells were overlaid on a plate containing sulfate as the sulfur source, and 2SC was added to the center of the plate. 2SC caused a zone of growth inhibition to occur on yxeL deletant but not WT B. subtilis, whereas N-acetyl-S-(2-succino)cysteine (N-acetyl-2SC) did not inhibit growth of either strain (Fig. 4). These data indicate that 2SC is a toxic compound, at least in B. subtilis at high exogenous concentrations, and that N-acetylation relieves toxicity. Our data indicate that the first step in 2SC breakdown is N-acetylation and that oxygenation and deacetylation steps are also required. A reasonable scenario involves acetylation of 2SC followed by oxygenation of N-acetyl-2SC and formation of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which is deacetylated to give cysteine, analogous to the proposed breakdown pathway of other S-alkylcysteine compounds (26Chan C.M. Danchin A. Marlière P. Sekowska A. Paralogous metabolism: S-alkyl-cysteine degradation in Bacillus subtilis.Environ. Microbiol. 2014; 16 (23944997): 101-11710.1111/1462-2920.12210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). If this proposed pathway for 2SC deconstruction is correct, then mutants should accumulate their respective upstream pathway intermediates. The first step in the pathway is acetylation of 2SC. Thus, we predicted that acetyltransferase (e.g. yxeL) mutants would accumulate 2SC. We profiled B. subtilis cells grown on medium containing fumarate as the carbon source in an attempt to increase the spontaneous succination of thiols by fumarate, thereby increasing 2SC formation. 2SC was detected in both WT and snaA deletant cells, but yxeL deletants accumulated around 70-fold more 2SC (Fig. 5A). There was no significant difference in 2SC levels between the yxeL deletant and yxeL snaA double mutant cells (Fig. 5A). These data confirm that the yxeL gene product is the main enzyme controlling 2SC levels in vivo. We proposed that YxeK is a monooxygenase that acts on N-acetyl-2SC. Thus, yxeK mutants should accumulate N-acetyl-2SC. We profiled B. subtilis cells grown on medium containing glucose as the carbon source but were unable to detect N-acetyl-2SC in WT or yxeK deletant cells (Fig. 5B). In an attempt to force carbon flux through the 2SC breakdown pathway, we added 2SC to the culture either 10 or 60 min prior to harvesting the cells. When 2SC was added to the culture 10 min prior to harvesting, yxeK deletant cells showed a massive accumulation of N-acetyl-2SC to around 8 μmol mg−1 of protein (Fig. 5B). By 60 min after 2SC addition, N-acetyl-2SC was still readily detectable, but the levels decreased about 25-fold compared with 10 min after 2SC addition (Fig. 5B). There was also a small but significant increase in NAC at 60 min after 2SC addition (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that the yxeK gene product plays a major role in the breakdown of 2SC by acting on N-acetyl-2SC, likely giving rise to NAC. Because the levels of N-acetyl-2SC decreased and NAC slightly increased between 10 and 60 min after 2SC addition to the mutant, there may be one or more functionally redundant mechanisms that can partially compensate for the loss of YxeK. YxeP is predicted to be an NAC deacetylase that completes the 2SC breakdown pathway. Because growth tests indicated that B. subtilis has three functionally redundant NAC deacetylase genes (Fig. 3B), we profiled the triple mutant strain (ΔyxeP ΔsndAC). Cells were grown in the same manner as the yxeK deletants. There was no increase in NAC 10 min after addition of 2SC, but there was a significant increase in N-acetyl-2SC (Fig. 5C). At 60 min after 2SC addition, NAC levels increased about 60-fold, and N-acetyl-2SC levels increased about 10-fold compared with the values obtained at 10 min after 2SC addition (Fig. 5C). These data show that the levels of both upstream intermediates, N-acetyl-2SC and NAC, increase in the NAC deacetylase triple mutant and provide evidence in support of the proposed pathway. Our results provide strong biochemical and genetic evidence that genes of the yxe operon are primarily responsible for 2SC breakdown in B. subtilis. The initial breakdown step is N-acetylation of 2SC, a reaction that YxeL performs remarkably well (Table 1). The catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) of YxeL is ∼350-fold higher than that of bacterial serine acetyltransferase, which is another small-molecule acetyltransferase involved in cysteine metabolism (29Oda K. Matoba Y. Kumagai T. Noda M. Sugiyama M. Crystallographic study to determine the substrate specificity of an L-serine-acetylating enzyme found in the D-cycloserine biosynthetic pathway.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195 (23396912): 1741-174910.1128/JB.02085-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This high efficiency might be necessary because of the toxicity of 2SC (Fig. 4) and thus the need to avoid its accumulation. Our data show that the concentration of 2SC is maintained below 5 μm in B. subtilis cells (assuming a cell volume of 4.6 fl(30Yu A.C. Loo J.F. Yu S. Kong S.K. Chan T.F. Monitoring bacterial growth using tunable resistive pulse sensing with a pore-based technique.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2014; 98 (24287933): 855-86210.1007/s00253-013-5377-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)) unless yxeL is disrupted, even when grown under conditions that should favor an increase in succination (Fig. 5A). In addition to initiating the salvage of cysteine from 2SC, YxeL may also prevent the accumulation of a toxic metabolite by converting it to a more benign form. If that were the case, then yxeL would fit the definition of a metabolite damage-preemption gene (31Linster C.L. Van Schaftingen E. Hanson A.D. Metabolite damage and its repair or pre-emption.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9 (23334546): 72-8010.1038/nchembio.1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The next step in 2SC breakdown, carried out by YxeK, is likely oxygenation of the succinyl moiety of N-acetyl-2SC, leading to the release of NAC. One possible mechanism for this step is that YxeK hydroxylates"

Nine professional male tennis players were tested in a rest day, and 2-week after, during the first match of a professional tournament played in a clay-court. Salivary concentrations of cortisol (SalCC) were measured in a resting day (9:00 am and 8:00 pm), at the match day (9:00 am and 8:00 pm) and immediately before and after the match. Hydration status was assessed before the match (urine specific gravity; USG) while fluid turnover was tracked during the match. Finally, counter movement jump (CMJ) and handgrip isometric strength (HS) were measured before and after the match. SalCC, either in the morning (P = 0.161) and afternoon (P = 0.683) was similar in rest and match days. However, SalCC increased after the match (P = 0.033). Participants started the match hypohydrated (USG = 1.026±0.002) and during the match lost 1.0±0.3% of body weight despite 1.035±0.124 L/h of fluid ingested. CMJ and HS did not change post-match (P = 0.210 and P = 0.881, respectively). Correlations between the elevations in SalCC and dehydration (% BW loss) during the match were significant (r = -0.632; P = 0.034). Professional male tennis players did not show an anticipatory increase in SalCC the day of the match and neither signs of neuromuscular fatigue after it. During the match, the mild dehydration (i.e., <1.5%) was associated with the increases in cortisol levels which suggests that dehydration may be an added stress to be considered."

Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO results for patient aged <65 years is well known. However, the risk profile and in-hospital prognosis of advanced age patients with ECMO still need more investigation. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors that predicted the outcomes for elderly patients who received VA-ECMO. Methods In this retrospective study, medical records for patients with ECMO aged 65 years and over were collected between 2009 and 2012 at a tertiary hospital. Results A total of 99 patients (mean age: 76.4±6.4 years) were included. The most common condition requiring VA-ECMO support was cardiogenic shock. Among survivors on VA-ECMO, 28 (28.3%) patients were successfully weaned from support. Thirteen (13.1%) patients were successfully discharged. We found that cardiogenic shock (OR = 3.158, P = 0.013), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score (OR = 1.147, P<0.001), and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) score (OR = 1.054, P = 0.001) were risk factors associated with survival on VA-ECMO. By using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, the APACHE II score and SAPS II score displayed acceptable discriminative power (AUC 0.722; 0.715, respectively). Conclusion Our findings indicate that the risk of mortality increases with cardiogenic shock, higher APACHE II score, and higher SAPS II score. These risk factors can be utilized as potential predictors to identify the potential candidates for ECMO support."

Therefore, LPS synthesis in bacteria is an attractive target for antibiotic development. LpxH is a pyrophosphatase involved in LPS synthesis, and previous structures revealed that LpxH has a helical cap that binds its lipid substrates. Here, crystallography and hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS provided evidence for a highly flexible substrate-binding cap in LpxH. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations disclosed how the helices of the cap may open to allow substrate entry. The predicted opening mechanism was supported by activity assays of LpxH variants. Finally, we confirmed biochemically that LpxH is inhibited by a previously identified antibacterial compound, determined the potency of this inhibitor, and modeled its binding mode in the LpxH active site. In summary, our work provides evidence that the substrate-binding cap of LpxH is highly dynamic, thus allowing for facile substrate binding and product release between the capping helices. Our results also pave the way for the rational design of more potent LpxH inhibitors."

Despite a greater burden of AF risk factors in Hispanics/Latinos the prevalence of AF remains low. Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies have identified numerous AF susceptibility loci in mostly whites of European descent. The goal of this study was to determine if the top 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AF in patients of European descent also increase susceptibility to AF in Hispanics/Latinos. AF cases were prospectively enrolled in the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) AF Registry and control subjects were identified from the UIC Cohort of Patients, Family and Friends. AF cases and controls were genotyped for 9 AF risk SNPs at chromosome 1q21: rs13376333, rs6666258; chr1q24: rs3903239; chr4q25: rs2200733; rs10033464; chr10q22: rs10824026; chr14q23: rs1152591; chr16q22: rs2106261 and rs7193343. The study sample consisted of 713 Hispanic/Latino subjects including 103 AF cases and 610 controls. Among the 8 AF risk SNPs genotyped, only rs10033464 SNP at chromosome (chr) 4q25 (near PITX2) was significantly associated with development of AF after multiple risk factor adjustment and multiple testing (adj. odds ratio [OR] 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31–3.94; P = 3.3 x 10−3). Furthermore, the association remained significant when the analysis was restricted to Hispanics of Mexican descent (adj. OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.35–3.99; P = 0.002. We confirm for the first time the association between a chromosome 4q25 SNP and increased susceptibility to AF in Hispanics/Latinos. While the underlying molecular mechanisms by which the chr4q25 SNP modulates AF risk remains unclear, this study supports a genetic basis for non-familial AF in patients of Hispanic descent."
https://openalex.org/W2796307352,"Worldwide tree mortality as induced by climate change presents a challenge to forest managers. To successfully manage vulnerable forests requires the capacity of regeneration to compensate for losses from tree mortality. We observed rapid regeneration and the growth release of young trees after warming-induced mortality in a David aspen-dominated (Populus davidiana) broad-leaved forest in Inner Mongolia, China, as based on individual tree measurements taken in 2012 and 2015 from a 6-ha permanent plot. Warming and drought stress killed large trees 10-15 m tall with a total number of 2881 trees during 2011-2012, and also thinned the upper crowns. David aspen recruitment increased 2 times during 2012-2015 and resulted in a high transition probability of David aspen replacing the same or other species, whereas the recruitment of Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica) was much lower: it decreased from 2012 to 2015, indicating that rapid regeneration represented a regrowth phase for David aspen, and not succession to Mongolian oak. Further, we found that the recruitment density increased with canopy openness, thus implying that warming-induced mortality enhanced regeneration. Our results suggest that David aspen has a high regrowth ability to offset individual losses from warming-induced mortality. This important insight has implications for managing this vulnerable forest in the semi-arid region of northern China."
https://openalex.org/W2796371905,"Cellular responses to low oxygen conditions are mainly regulated by the Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Induction of HIF-1α in tumor cells activates the angiogenic switch and allows for metabolic adaptations. HIF-1α protein levels are tightly regulated through ubiquitin-mediated proteosomal degradation; however, high levels of HIF-1α is a common feature in many solid tumors and is thought to enhance cancer cell proliferation, migration, and survival. Here, we report that the oncogenic p73 isoform, ∆Np73, increases HIF-1α protein stability. We found that ∆Np73 represses expression of genes encoding subunits of the ECV complex, in particular Elongin C, Elongin B, Cullin 2, and Rbx1. The ECV complex is an E3 ligase complex responsible for polyubiquitinating HIF-1α. Loss of ∆Np73 increases ubiquitination of HIF-1α, leading to its degradation via the proteosomal pathway, and subsequent decrease of HIF-1α target genes. Taken together, our data demonstrates that high levels of ∆Np73 stabilize HIF-1α protein, allowing for it to accumulate and further potentiating its transcriptional activity and supporting tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2795820999,"Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based cell-replacement therapy has emerged as a promising approach for addressing numerous neurological diseases. However, hPSC transplantation has the potential to cause human cell overgrowth and cancer, which represents a major obstacle to implementing hPSC-based therapies. Inhibition of the overgrowth of transplanted cells could help reduce the risk for hPSC transplantation-induced tumorigenesis. In this study, we report that the telomerase inhibitor azidothymidine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine; AZT) enhances the differentiation of cortical neurons and significantly suppresses the proliferation of hPSC-derived cortical progenitors. Using human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells in culture, we found that AZT effectively reduces the number of dividing progenitors without inducing cell death. Furthermore, AZT promoted differentiation of cortical progenitors and maturation of cortical neurons. Of note, AZT-pretreated, hPSC-derived neural progenitors exhibited decreased proliferation and increased differentiation into cortical neurons when transplanted into the mouse brain. In summary, our findings indicate that AZT prevents the overgrowth of hPSC-derived neural precursors and enhances the differentiation of cortical neurons in both cell cultures and hPSC-transplanted mouse brain. We propose that our work could inform clinical applications of hPSC-based cell therapy."
