https://openalex.org/W1976810974,"The application of H(3)-thymidine results in labeling of those nuclei of cells in which deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is synthesized during the interval between application and the sacrifice of tne animal (1-3). This paper reports autoradiographic investigation with H(3)-thymidine of rats and mice. This method permits a more exact statement of the number of dividing cells than does the microscopic estimate of mitosis. The latter method is practically impossible in tissues with small fusiform cells. Moreover, it is possible to obtain information about the relative time of DNA synthesis in different cells."

Isotope from acetate-l-Cl4 and acetate-2-Cl4 are incorporated into carbons 3 and 4 respectively of cr-methylbutyrate. 2. Ascaris muscle strips also incorporate propionate-1-U4, propionate-2-Cl4 and propionate-3-Cl4 into cw-methylbutyrate. Isotope from these species of propionate are incorporated into carbons 1, 2, and 5, respectively, of cr-methylbutyrate. 3. The degree of incorporation of isotopic acetate and pro- pionate into a-methylbutyrate, as well as the distribution of labeling found, indicate that the branched chain carbon skeleton of a-methylbutyrate is formed by a condensation of the acetate carboxyl carbon with carbon 2 of propionate. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22.

https://openalex.org/W1979181816,"Histidine decarboxylase activity of mouse tissues is increased by stress and by injection of epinephrine and norepinephrine, suggesting a balance between histamine and catechol amines producing a component of circulatory homeostasis. Imbalance during intense stress might lead to failure of circulatory homeostasis and to shock. Reasons for discounting histamine as ""shock toxin"" may be invalid."

https://openalex.org/W2074626596,SENSITIVITY to wheat or rye gluten is the essential mechanism in the pathogenesis of cœliac disease and idiopathic steatorrhœa. Such patients improve on a gluten-free diet and deteriorate on the re-introduction of gluten itself or its autoclaved and filtered peptic/tryptic digest into the diet1. In these diseases a disturbance of small intestinal function is a major factor2.

https://openalex.org/W2083134520,"RECENTLY, considerable attention has been paid to a method of determining the physiological age of female insects of economic importance by the appearance of the ovarioles after ovulation. This method, which was originally worked out by Soviet entomologists1,2 for Anopheles, and has since been extended to other blood-sucking Diptera, depends upon the recognition of the number of follicular relics (‘corpora lutea’) appearing as dilatations of the follicular tubes. Each dilatation represents the relic of a single egg follicle and is evidence of a gonotrophic cycle. If the duration of the cycle is known it is possible to calculate the calendar age of the female, a factor of great practical application in determining the epidemiological importance of populations of insect vectors or the degree of success of control programmes. In the laboratory, Bertram and Samarawickrema3 recognized Mansonioides uniformis which had completed five gonotrophic cycles by the presence of five dilatations in the follicular tubes. A study of the ovarioles of Glossina morsitans after ovulation has been made, and it is suggested that a similar method of determining the physiological age of female tsetse flies should be possible."
https://openalex.org/W2057060968,The frequency of inagglutinable erythrocytes was increased in pigeons following total body irradiation and in human polycythemic patients treated with P(32). Persistence of the increased levels of inagglutinable cells was observed in pigeons retested at over 200 days after irradiation and in a polycythemic patient retested at 173 days posttreatment. These data provide additional evidence for the mutational origin of the antigen-lacking cells.

https://openalex.org/W2079317494,A METHOD was previously developed1 for the direct colorimetric estimation of elastin by treating a sample of tissue with orcein. All free stain is removed and elastin hydrolyzed with elastase (pancreatin). The stain which is brought in this way into solution is then photometrically estimated.

Moreover, varying amounts of non-creatinine chromogen in such filtrates are known2 to be partly responsible for differences in the total chromogen content."

https://openalex.org/W1986773837,IN EARLIER experiments1 it was shown that incubation of whole rat pituitaries in vitro in whole aqueous hypothalamic extract increased pituitary acid phosphatase activity. In further experiments2–5 evidence has been submitted in support of the view that a relationship exists between activation of pituitary acid phosphatases in vivo and formation of the thyreotrophic hormone and that the presumed hypothalamic humoral factor activating pituitary acid phosphatases in vitro is related to thyroid-stimulating hormone secretion. The present communication gives the results of experiments investigating the extent to which the influence of hypothalmic extract on acid phosphatases in the rat pituitary in vitro can be modified by previous administration of methylthiouracil to hypothalamus donor rats or by previous thyroidectomy of these animals.

F., personal communication). We have found similar non-specific hæmagglutinins in batches of normal cellulose, CAM-cellulose and ECTEOLA-cellulose (Schleicher and Schüll, Dassel, Germany ; Serva-Entwicklungslabor, Heidelberg, Germany)."
