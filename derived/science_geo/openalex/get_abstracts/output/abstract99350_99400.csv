https://openalex.org/W2072928113,"The phenomenon of inhibition of tumor growth by tumor mass has been repeatedly studied, but without elucidation of a satisfactory mechanism. In our animal model, a primary tumor inhibits its remote metastases. After tumor removal, metastases neovascularize and grow. When the primary tumor is present, metastatic growth is suppressed by a circulating angiogenesis inhibitor. Serum and urine from tumor-bearing mice, but not from controls, specifically inhibit endothelial cell proliferation. The activity copurifies with a 38 kDa plasminogen fragment that we have sequenced and named angiostatin. A corresponding fragment of human plasminogen has similar activity. Systemic administration of angiostatin, but not intact plasminogen, potently blocks neovascularization and growth of metastases. We here show that the inhibition of metastases by a primary mouse tumor is mediated, at least in part, by angiostatin."
https://openalex.org/W2025778924,"Contact-dependent axon growth inhibitory activity is present in CNS myelin, but the inhibitory proteins have not been fully characterized. We report here that at least two peaks of inhibitory activity can be separated by fractionating solubilized CNS myelin proteins by DEAE chromatography. A major peak of inhibitory activity corresponded to the elution profile of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Immunodepletion of MAG from these inhibitory fractions removed neurite growth inhibition, whereas recombinant MAG (ectodomain) was a potent inhibitor of neurite outgrowth. Immunodepletion of MAG from total extracts of CNS myelin restored neurite growth up to 63% of control levels. These results establish that MAG is a significant, and possibly the major, inhibitor in CNS myelin; this has broad implications for axonal regeneration in the injured mammalian CNS."

https://openalex.org/W1606812696,"Mutant (delta F508) and wild-type cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) were synthesized initially as an approximately 140-kDa core-glycosylated precursor, which, in the case of wild-type CFTR, was chased to an approximately 160 kDa form bearing complex oligosaccharides. Mutant CFTR disappeared from the detergent-soluble cell extract with rapid (t1/2 = 27 min) kinetics. Only approximately 25% of the initially synthesized wild-type 140-kDa CFTR precursor was detected as mature protein; the remaining approximately 75% decayed with kinetics (t1/2 = 33 min) indistinguishable from those of the mutant. Rapid degradation kinetics and inefficient processing of wild-type CFTR were also observed in the colonic carcinoma lines HT29 and T84 and in stably transfected C127 cells, which express 5-50 times lower levels of CFTR. These results suggest that inefficient processing and rapid degradation of wild-type CFTR precursor are an intrinsic property of CFTR in these diverse cell types and are not an artifact of overexpression. Degradation of wild-type and mutant 140-kDa CFTR began without significant lag following synthesis. These data suggest that wild-type and delta F508 CFTR differ in the efficiency of folding of the core-glycosylated primary translation product."
https://openalex.org/W2073286007,"Each residue in and flanking the M2 membrane-spanning segment of the α subunit, from Glu-241 to Glu-262, was mutated to cysteine, and the mutant subunits were expressed together with wild-type β, γ, and δ subunits in Xenopus oocytes. Cysteines substituted for Glu-262, Leu-258, Val-255, Ser-252, Leu-251, Leu-250, Ser-248, Leu-245, Thr-244, and Glu-241 reacted with the positively charged, hydrophilic, sulfhydryl-specific reagent methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA), added extracellularly. These 10 residues, therefore, are exposed in the channel lumen. The pattern of exposure is compatible with an α helix, interrupted by an extended structure from Leu-250 to Ser-252. Acetylcholine caused subtle changes in the accessibilities of some of the engineered cysteines. Since all 10 residues are accessible to MTSEA in the closed state of the channel, the channel gate is at least as cytoplasmic as Glu-241, the most cytoplasmic of the residues tested."

https://openalex.org/W1987322407,"Modulation of NMDA-mediated responses by oxidizing and reducing reagents has been described in a variety of neuronal preparations. Here, we report that NMDA-gated currents of oocytes expressing heteromeric NMDA receptors are also modulated by sulfhydryl redox reagents. Each cysteine residue in the NMDAR1 (NR1) subunit and each conserved NMDAR2 (NR2) cysteine residue in a prototypical subunit (NR2B) was tested for its role in redox modulation. We have identified 2 cysteines in the NR1 subunit that are required for redox modulation of NMDA-gated currents in oocytes expressing NR1-NR2B, NR1-NR2C, or NR1-NR2D receptors. Mutation of these same 2 cysteines also eliminated potentiation by spermine and shifted the IC50 for H+ inhibition and the EC50 for NMDA. Redox modulation of heteromeric NR1-NR2A receptors appeared to be different from that of the other heteromeric receptors, indicating the presence of one or more unique redox modulatory sites on NR1-NR2A receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2054802842,"Four potent metalloporphyrin inhibitors of heme oxygenase were used to assess whether carbon monoxide production was required for induction of LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Although the metalloporphyrins produced a similar and substantial inhibition of heme oxygenase activity in hippocampal slices, only two compounds reduced the amount of LTP elicited by tetanic stimulation (chromium mesoporphyrin IX and zinc protoporphyrin IX). Both chromium mesoporphyrin IX and zinc protoporphyrin IX inhibited nitric oxide synthase in the hippocampus; tin mesoporphyrin IX and zinc deuteroporphyrin IX bis glycol neither reduced LTP induction nor inhibited NOS activity, although they did inhibit heme oxygenase. None of these metalloporphyrins reversed established LTP. Thus, together these data do not support carbon monoxide as a mediator in either LTP induction or expression/maintenance and emphasize further the nonselectivity of some metalloporphyrins."
https://openalex.org/W2135704180,"Potent and selective inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) compared to endothelial NOS (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) may be useful to treat cerebral ischemia (stroke) and other neurodegenerative diseases. S-Methyl-L-thiocitrulline (Me-TC) and S-ethyl-L-thiocitrulline (Et-TC) inhibited the oxidation of L-arginine and the L-arginine-independent oxidation of NADPH by nNOS from human brain. Me-TC and Et-TC were slow, tight binding inhibitors of nNOS with second-order association rate constants (kon) of 2.6 x 10(5) M-1 s-1 and 1.3 x 10(5) M-1 s-1, respectively. The respective dissociation rate constants (koff) were 3 x 10(-4) s-1 and 0.7 x 10(-4) s-1. Thus, the Kd values calculated from koff/kon were 1.2 and 0.5 nM, respectively. L-Arginine was a competitive inhibitor of Me-TC and Et-TC binding with competition constant (Ks) values of 2.2 and 2.7 microM, respectively. The Km of nNOS for L-arginine was 1.6 microM. The active site concentration of nNOS was estimated by titration with Et-TC. Based on this active site concentration, a kcat of 0.4 s-1 for the oxidation of L-arginine, was calculated. Me-TC and Et-TC were less potent inhibitors of human iNOS (Ki values of 34 and 17 nM, respectively) and human eNOS (Ki values of 11 and 24 nM). Thus, Me-TC and Et-TC were 10- and 50-fold, respectively, more potent inhibitors of nNOS than eNOS. Furthermore, Me-TC was also 17-fold selective for rat nNOS in neuronal tissue compared to rat eNOS in vascular endothelium, suggesting that Me-TC may be selective for nNOS in vivo and therefore, may be therapeutically useful to treat neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1528301939,"To elucidate structure-function relationships of stromelysin-3, a putative matrix metalloproteinase originally identified at the tumor-stromal cell interface in breast carcinomas, the human cDNA was expressed in mammalian cells, and its products were isolated and characterized. In stably transfected cells, stromelysin-3 was recovered as a complex mixture of species ranging in size from approximately 20 to 65 kDa. Among these products, a major 45-kDa species with an N terminus of Phe98 and an intact C-terminal domain was identified as a true endopeptidase on the basis of its ability to cleave the bait region of alpha 2-macroglobulin between Phe684 and Tyr685, a site identical to that recognized by stromelysin-1. However, unlike stromelysin-1 or other members of the matrix metalloproteinase family, the mature form of stromelysin-3 was unable to hydrolyze a range of extracellular matrix molecules associated with either the basement membrane or interstitium. To probe for alternate substrates among tumor cell-derived products, purified stromelysin-3 was incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled medium conditioned by the breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. Under these conditions, a single, tumor cell-derived protein was hydrolyzed as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Following anion-exchange chromatography and preparative gel electrophoresis, the stromelysin-3 substrate was identified by N-terminal sequencing as the serine proteinase inhibitor, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. Further studies demonstrated that stromelysin-3 rapidly destroyed the antiproteolytic function of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor by cleaving the antiproteinase at a distinct site between Ala350 and Met351 within the reactive-site loop. Together, these data not only demonstrate that human stromelysin-3 acts as a powerful endopeptidase with a restricted substrate specificity distinct from all other matrix metalloproteinases, but also serve to identify serine proteinase inhibitors as potential physiologic targets at sites of extracellular matrix remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W1547089995,"The rat Na(+)- and Cl(-)-dependent serotonin transporter was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus system. Expression of the serotonin transporter caused the Sf9 cells to accumulate [3H]serotonin (Km 78 nM) and to bind the specific transport inhibitor [125I]RT155 (2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-[125I]iodophenyl)tropane) (Kd 0.22 nM). Ligand binding assays on isolated membranes showed 500,000 copies of the serotonin transporter/cell (9 pmol/mg of membrane protein). Immunoreactive bands of apparent M(r) 54,000 (unglycosylated) and 60,000 (glycosylated) were observed in Western blots of membrane proteins from infected cells. The 54-kDa band was significantly smaller than the expected M(r) of 72,500 predicted from the cDNA sequence. The 54-kDa band was shown to represent the intact serotonin transporter by expressing a recombinant serotonin transporter that contained c-Myc and FLAG epitope tags engineered at the N and C termini, respectively. Both tags were present on a membrane protein that migrated slightly slower than the previously observed 54-kDa band, consistent with the extra mass added by the tags. The tags did not affect the Kd for [125I]RT155 binding. The effect of N-linked glycosylation on ligand binding and the level of expression were studied. The expression of the serotonin transporter in tunicamycin-treated Sf9 cells resulted in low levels of ligand binding activity (0.2 pmol/mg) but unchanged Kd. Similarly, mutated serotonin transporters that contained reduced numbers of N-linked glycosylation sites had unchanged Kd for [125I]RT155 binding whether there were 2, 1, or 0 N-linked glycosylation sites present on the serotonin transporter. In contrast, Bmax was dramatically reduced; levels of expression of the unglycosylated serotonin transporter (0.4 pmol/mg) were 20-fold lower compared with levels of the fully glycosylated serotonin transporter. The Km for [3H]serotonin uptake was also unchanged. These data indicate that glycosylation is required for optimal stability of the serotonin transporter in the membrane but not for serotonin transport or ligand binding per se."
https://openalex.org/W1644556558,"Integrin alpha 2 beta 1 is a major divalent cation-dependent receptor for collagen. Here, we show that the recombinant inserted/interactive domain (I domain) of alpha 2 specifically interacts with collagen, indicating the I domain contains all the components necessary for collagen binding. Evidence was obtained that divalent cations are not required for collagen binding to the I domain fragment, indicating that divalent cations are not involved in the actual binding to collagen but probably in the regulation of the binding. We identified Thr-221 within the previously identified putative ligand binding region as a residue critical for collagen binding to both alpha 2 beta 1 and the I domain fragment. Thr-221 may be involved in the actual collagen binding and recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2080653091,"RNA editing in the mitochondrion of Trypanosoma brucei extensively alters the adenosine triphosphate synthase (ATPase) subunit 6 precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) by addition of 447 uridines and removal of 28 uridines. In vivo, the guide RNA gA6[14] is thought to specify the deletion of two uridines from the editing site closest to the 3' end. In this study, an in vitro system was developed that accurately removed uridines from this editing site in synthetic ATPase 6 pre-mRNA when gA6[14] and ATP were added. Mutations in both the guide RNA and the pre-mRNA editing site suggest that base-pairing interactions control the number of uridines deleted in vitro. Thus, guide RNAs are required for RNA editing and for the transfer of genetic information to pre-mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1531495231,"The c-kit proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, which is important for the normal development of hematopoietic cells, melanoblasts, and germ cells. Autophosphorylation of c-kit receptor on tyrosine creates binding sites for cellular src homology 2 (SH2)-containing signaling molecules. The discovery of phosphotyrosine phosphatases that contain SH2 domains suggests roles for these molecules in growth factor signaling pathways. We found that Syp, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase widely expressed in all the tissues in mammals, associates with c-kit receptor after activation with its ligand, steel factor, in the factor-dependent cell line, M07e. Both NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal SH2 domains of Syp, made as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, were able to bind to the activated c-kit receptor in vitro. Furthermore, Syp became marginally phosphorylated on tyrosine upon c-kit receptor activation, and tyrosine-phosphorylated Syp was found to be complexed with Grb2 in steel factor-stimulated M07e cells. Direct binding between Syp and Grb2 was also observed in vitro. Last, Ras and Raf interacts in vitro as a result of steel factor-stimulated Ras activation. These results suggest that Syp may be an important signaling component downstream of the c-kit receptor and involved in activation of the Ras signaling pathway in hematopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1498102997,"Cytokines and growth factors elicit responses in target cells through induction of gene expression. Signaling mechanisms leading to gene transcription from cell surface receptors often require tyrosine phosphorylation. A family of transcription factors comprising the interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) multimeric complex are phosphorylated and activated in response to interferon. We describe a protein 50% identical to the 91-kDa subunit of ISGF3 that constitutes the acute phase response factor (APRF). This protein was rapidly activated by interleukin-6 to bind an enhancer element common to genes activated in liver cells during the acute phase response to inflammation. Remarkably, APRF was also activated by IFN alpha, IFN gamma, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, colony stimulating factor-1, and the cytokines leukemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin M. The growth factors also activated a third, distinct but related, DNA-binding protein in addition to APRF and p91. This novel factor or a closely related one, but neither APRF nor p91, was also activated in lymphoid cells by interleukin-2, erythropoietin, and interleukin-3. Activation of APRF, p91, and additional members of the ISGF3 family is thus a general feature of a wide variety of signaling pathways, integrating diverse signals through common transcriptional regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2073703547,"Membrane currents produced by the expression of a rat GABA transporter (GAT-1) stably transfected into HEK293 cells were characterized with a whole-cell voltage clamp. Three modes of function were identified: ex-gated currents produced by extracellular GABA, in-gated currents produced by intracellular GABA, and uncoupled currents produced in the absence of GABA. The ex-gated current was not the reversal of the in-gated current; moreover, the stoichiometry between GABA and co-ions was not always fixed. Each mode of function required a different set of ions on the two sides of the membrane. We made rapid solution changes and observed an allosteric effect of Na+ that only occurred at the extracellular surface. Thus, the GAT-1 transporter does not behave like a recirculating carrier but may be described as a pore with ion gates at either end that are controlled in part by allosteric sites."
https://openalex.org/W1560606266,"The cytoskeleton participates in the coordinated regulation of intracellular signaling molecules, following agonist stimulation of cells. We have demonstrated that von Willebrand factor (vWF) induced the cytoskeletal association and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) in human platelets. The activation of PtdIns 3-kinase coincided with the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple platelet proteins, as assessed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. One of these tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, pp60c-src, became specifically enriched in the cytoskeletal fraction of vWF-stimulated platelets. The vWF-stimulated cytoskeletal association of PtdIns 3-kinase and pp60c-src required platelet stirring and aggregation, was specifically blocked by an anti-GPIb monoclonal antibody, and was not observed in platelets lacking the glycoprotein Ib/IX complex (Bernard-Soulier syndrome). Pretreatment of normal platelets with 5 mM EDTA (37 degrees C for 90 min) or RGDS (2 mM), which disrupts the binding of various adhesive proteins to platelet integrins and inhibits fibrinogen-mediated platelet aggregation, did not alter the vWF-stimulated activation and cytoskeletal association of PtdIns 3-kinase and pp60c-src. Pretreatment of platelets with acetylsalicylic acid (1 mM) completely abolished vWF-stimulated production of thromboxane A2, dense granule release, and the activation of protein kinase C, without altering the activation and cytoskeletal translocation of PtdIns 3-kinase and pp60c-src. Our results suggest that vWF binding to the platelet adhesion receptor glycoprotein Ib/IX can mediate activation and translocation of both tyrosine and lipid kinase(s) independent of other agonists."

Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice are defective in general double-strand (ds) DNA break repair and V(D)J coding joint formation, resulting in arrested lymphocyte development. A single treatment of newborn SCID mice with DNA-damaging agents restored functional, diverse, T cell receptor β chain coding joints, as well as development and expansion of thymocytes expressing both CD4 and CD8 coreceptors, but did not promote B cell development. Thymic lymphoma developed in all mice treated with DNA-damaging agents, suggesting an interrelation between V(D)J recombination, dsDNA break repair, and lymphomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1538844921,"Nitric oxide synthase catalyzes the formation of an important messenger molecule, nitric oxide (NO). It is a P450-type hemoprotein, containing a cysteine thiolate as its proximal heme ligand, but the exact cysteine residue involved in heme coordination has not been identified. To locate this specific cysteine, we altered three potential cysteine residues (Cys-99, Cys-184, and Cys-441) to alanine residues in human endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and expressed the wild-type and mutant eNOSs in COS-1 and the baculovirus expression system. Mutation of Cys-235 to alanine was included to serve as a control. Mutation of Cys-184 resulted in a complete loss of NOS catalytic activity and abrogation of the formation of carbon monoxide (CO)-heme ferrous complex, which was detected on CO difference spectra as a distinct peak centered on 444-446 nm, without reduction in the quantity of eNOS protein. Mutation of Cys-99 also resulted in a loss of catalytic activity but did not eliminate the 444-446 nm peak. C441A and C235A mutants displayed considerable NOS activity and retained the CO-heme peak on CO-ferrous difference spectra. These results indicate that the cysteine 184 of human eNOS is most likely the proximal heme ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1509995036,"The calcium/calmodulin-regulated phosphatase calcineurin (CN) is the site of action of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506. CN has recently been established as a key signaling enzyme in the T cell signal transduction cascade and an important regulator of transcription factors such as NF-AT and OAP/Oct-1, which are involved in the expression of a number of important T cell early genes. CsA and FK506 act by forming complexes with their respective intracellular receptors cyclophilin and FKBP (immunophilins), which can then bind to CN, inhibiting its enzymatic activity and thereby preventing early gene expression. CN is comprised of two subunits: a 59-kDa catalytic subunit (CNA), which contains a calmodulin binding domain and autoinhibitory region, and a 19-kDa intrinsic calcium binding regulatory subunit (CNB). In this study, we have utilized a series of deletion mutants of the CNA subunit to investigate the subunit and molecular requirements that govern the interaction of CN with drug-immunophilin complexes. The calmodulin binding and autoinhibitory domains of the CNA subunit were found to be dispensable for the binding of CN to drug-immunophilin complexes. In contrast, we found that the regulatory CNB subunit appears to play an obligatory role in this interaction and have defined an amino acid sequence of the CNA subunit which forms the binding site for CNB. Although necessary, the CNB subunit per se is not sufficient to mediate an interaction with drug-immunophilin complexes; amino acid residues of the CNA subunit, specifically a region located within the putative catalytic domain, are also required for the interaction of CN with both FKBP-FK506 and cyclophilin A-CsA."
https://openalex.org/W1553509509,"Keratins are a group of water-insoluble proteins constituting paired acidic and basic keratin molecules that form 10-nm intermediate filaments in epithelial cells. Expression of the K3/K12 keratin pair characterizes the cornea-type differentiation. However, the mechanism that regulates this cornea-specific K12 expression remains unknown. To provide a better understanding of the cornea-specific expression, we have cloned the K12 cDNA (Liu, C.-Y., Zhu, G., Westerhausen-Larson, A., Converse, R., Kao, C. W.-C., Sun, T.-T., and Kao, W. W.-Y. (1993) Curr. Eye Res. 12, 963-974). In present studies, the murine K12 keratin gene (Krt1.12) was isolated and characterized. The murine Krt1.12 gene spans 6,567 base pairs of genomic DNA, and the mRNA encoding K12 keratin is distributed into eight exons. Chromosome mapping reveals that murine Krt1.12 is located within the Krt1 complex of mouse chromosome 11. In addition to the production of authentic K12 mRNA, the Krt1.12 gene gives rise to several alternate poly(A)+ RNAs by the use of alternative splicing in intron 2, an alternative promoter in intron 1, and/or both. Sequence analysis indicates that the transcripts derived from alternative splicing and/or the alternative promoter do not have a long open reading frame for keratin or keratin-like molecules. It is not known whether these alternate K12 poly(A)+ RNAs have any biological functions, e.g. regulation of K12 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2020686203,"Cultured retinal amacrine cells show quantal GABAergic synaptic transmission. Voltage clamping pre- and postsynaptic cells of an isolated pair has allowed us to examine the entry and removal of Ca 2+ at synaptic terminals. Brief presynaptic Ca2+ currents elicit an initial postsynaptic current that probably reflects the roughly synchronous exocytosis of docked vesicles. Prolonged Ca 2+ currents elicit an additional second phase of release whose time course can greatly exceed that of the presynaptic voltage step. The time course of this second phase reflects a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and is matched closely by the activity of the presynaptic NaCa exchanger, as revealed by an exchange current. Eliminating the activity of the exchanger by removal of external Na+ prolongs this second phase of transmission greatly. Because transmitter release at these synapses outlasts Ca+ channel opening, Na-Ca exchange plays a significant role in shaping transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1917982022,"Nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) catalyzes the oxidation of L-arginine to citrulline and nitric oxide (NO). The enzyme is inhibited by a variety of N omega-monosubstituted L-arginine analogs, and some of these compounds are useful in reversing pathologies associated with the overproduction of NO (e.g. the hypotension of septic shock). We report here that L-thiocitrulline (gamma-thioureido-L-norvaline) is a potent, stereospecific inhibitor of the constitutive brain and endothelial isoforms of NOS as well as the isoform induced in vascular smooth muscle cells by lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma. Steady state kinetic studies show L-thiocitrulline inhibition is competitive with L-arginine (Ki approximately 4-20% of KArgm), indicating that initial binding is as a substrate/product analog. In contrast to L-arginine and N omega-methyl-L-arginine, the prototypic NOS inhibitor, L-thiocitrulline binding elicits a Type II difference spectrum, indicating a high spin to low spin transition of the iron in the heme cofactor. This finding suggests that L-thiocitrulline is contributing the sixth ligand to heme iron, probably through the thioureido sulfur. Such interaction with heme iron neither stimulates nor inhibits the direct flavin-mediated cytochrome c reduction activity of the enzyme, but it does inhibit heme-dependent superoxide formation. In vivo, L-thiocitrulline is a potent pressor agent in both normal and endotoxemic rats, the latter finding suggesting utility in treating the hypotension of septic shock."
https://openalex.org/W1502422762,"Type I procollagen COOH-terminal proteinase (C-proteinase) enhancer, a glycoprotein that binds to the COOH-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen and enhances procollagen C-proteinase activity, was purified from mouse fibroblast culture media. Partial amino acid sequences obtained from proteolytic fragments were found to have identity with the deduced amino acid sequence of a cDNA clone of unknown function, previously isolated from a mouse astrocyte library. Sequences of mouse enhancer cDNA, obtained in the present study, predict a approximately 50-kDa, 468-amino acid protein that differs from the 43-kDa, 402-amino acid protein predicted by the previously reported astrocyte-derived clone. Human cDNAs encode an enhancer of 449 amino acids. Previous biochemical studies have found the mouse enhancer as a 55-kDa form, which is readily processed to 36- and 34-kDa forms, retaining full C-proteinase enhancing activity and the ability to bind the COOH-terminal propeptide. Data presented here show the 36-kDa form to correspond to the amino-terminal portion of the 55-kDa protein. This is the most conserved region between mouse and human enhancers, comprising two domains with homology to domains found in a number of proteases and proteins with developmental functions. Such domains are thought to mediate interactions between proteins. Mouse enhancer RNA is shown to be at highest levels in collagen-rich tissues, especially tendon. The human enhancer gene, PCOLCE, is localized to 7q21.3-->q22, the same chromosomal region containing the type I collagen alpha 2 chain gene, COL1A2."
https://openalex.org/W1576843479,"In myositis, disease-specific autoantibodies may be directed against an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, usually histidyl-tRNA synthetase. To explore the basis for this phenomenon, we have made recombinant histidyl-tRNA synthetase in the baculovirus system. It was enzymatically active and recognized by human autoantibodies. A truncated protein lacking the first 60 amino acids was inactive as an antigen and as an enzyme. This region is within the first two exons, is predicted to have a coiled-coil configuration, and is found in some other synthetases but not in Escherichia coli or yeast histidyl-tRNA synthetase. Circular dichroism showed that the peptides from this region (amino acids 1-60 and 1-47) have the predicted high alpha-helical content, but smaller fragments (1-30, 14-45, and 31-60) do not. The peptides with a high alpha-helical content could inhibit autoantibodies almost completely, whereas the smaller peptides were unable to do so. The amino acid sequence of this coiled-coil domain in human histidyl-tRNA synthetase resembles the sequence of the extended this coiled-coil arm near the NH2 terminus of bacterial seryl-tRNA synthetase as well as similar regions in some eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, raising the possibility that this domain serves a similar tRNA-stabilizing role and has been preserved from a common ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W1541442773,"Vitronectin is a soluble serum factor that is known to promote epiboly of keratinocytes in explant cultures and enhance cell spreading and attachment to matrix. Recently, vitronectin was demonstrated to promote human keratinocyte locomotion. The mechanism(s) by which vitronectin enhances keratinocyte migration is unknown. In this study, we quantitated the vitronectin-driven migration of human keratinocytes in the presence of antibodies to vitronectin receptors. We found that vitronectin's effect of promoting human keratinocyte migration was inhibited by antibody-directed against the alpha v beta 5 receptor. In addition, we surface-labeled human keratinocytes, chromatographed extracts of the cell membranes on a vitronectin column, and then immunoprecipitated the bound and eluted proteins with antibodies to specific vitronectin receptors. We identified the vitronectin receptors on human keratinocytes as bands of 150,000 and 100,000 daltons without reduction and as 125,000 and 110,000 daltons under reducing conditions. Immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies identified the major receptor to be the alpha v beta 5 integrin. In addition, we quantitated vitronectin-driven migration of human keratinocytes in the presence of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) and control peptides. We found that the presence of RGD, but not control peptide, inhibited vitronectin-driven migration of human keratinocytes. These studies demonstrate that human keratinocytes express vitronectin receptors and use the alpha v beta 5 receptor for cellular locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W1542297269,"Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by decreased expression of Gs alpha and widespread tissue resistance to hormones that activate adenylyl cyclase. We identified a single mutation, R385H, in the Gs alpha gene of a subject with AHO who had evidence for a dysfunctional Gs alpha protein. The R385H substitution is near the carboxyl terminus of the Gs alpha protein and is located five amino acids upstream of the R389P mutation that uncouples Gs alpha from cell surface receptors in the unc clone of S49 murine lymphoma. To test the biological activity of the R385H mutant, we transiently expressed wild type, R385H, and R389P Gs alpha cDNAs in COS-1 cells. Neither of the mutant Gs alpha proteins stimulated adenylyl cyclase in response to l-isoproterenol (1 to 30 microM). By contrast, both mutant Gs alpha proteins showed activation of adenylyl cyclase in response to forskolin (10 microM) and fluoroaluminate (10 mM). We propose that the R385H mutation produces a Gs alpha molecule that is unable to interact with hormone receptors and results in uncoupling of adenylyl cyclase from cell surface receptors. This uncoupling mutation represents a new type of molecular defect that can result in AHO."
https://openalex.org/W1566771367,"The export of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) involves sorting and concentration, and has been proposed to require the function of heterotrimeric G proteins. To begin to identify the basic elements of a potential signaling pathway involved in vesicle assembly, we have examined whether protein kinase C (PKC) is required for ER to Golgi transport. Calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of the highly conserved cysteine-rich C6H2 motif present in the regulatory domain of PKC was found to be a potent inhibitor of export of VSV-G and vesicle budding from the ER in vivo and in vitro (IC50 approximately 60 nM). In contrast, the diacylglycerol analog phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which activates PKC, enhanced the migration of VSV-G from the ER to pre-Golgi intermediates. Neither reagent had detectable effects on the oligomerization of VSV-G prior to export nor perturbed transport of protein between compartments of the Golgi stack. In contrast to the striking effects of calphostin C, reagents that inhibit the function of the catalytic domain of PKC (including the general kinase inhibitor staurosporine, as well as the more specific inhibitors H-7, H-8, pseudosubstrate inhibitor, or chelerythrine) did not inhibit export from the ER. Export was also insensitive to down-regulation of various PKC isoforms. These results suggest that a novel protein containing the conserved C6H2 motif may serve as a potential link in a signaling pathway regulating vesicle budding from the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1627951033,"Abstract BcgI cassette mutagenesis was used to prepare variants of p66 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 reverse transcriptase with amino acid substitutions between residues Glu224 and Trp229. Mutant polypeptides were reconstituted in vitro with wild type p51 to generate the selectively mutated heterodimer series p66(224A)/p51-p66(229A)/p51. Purified enzymes were characterized with respect to dimerization, DNA polymerase, RNase H, and tRNA(Lys-3) binding. The combined analyses indicate that while alteration of p66 residues Glu224-Leu228 has minimal consequences, the DNA polymerase activities of mutant p66(229A)/p51 are impaired. DNase I footprinting illustrates that this mutant does not form a stable replication complex with a model template-primer. In vivo studies indicate that the equivalent mutation eliminates viral infectivity, suggesting a contribution of Trp229 toward architecture of the p66 primer grip."
https://openalex.org/W1502235918,"The aim of this study was to examine the peptide transport activity of a naturally occurring P-glycoprotein such as that present in rat liver canalicular membrane vesicles. The peptide ionophores valinomycin and gramicidin D, which are known substrates of P-glycoprotein, served to monitor the P-glycoprotein activity indirectly as the ATP-dependent uptake of 86Rb+ mediated by these ionophores. Canalicular membrane vesicles proved inherently permeable to K+ ions, which prevented assay of transport ionophore activity. Therefore, P-glycoprotein was extracted from canalicular membrane vesicles and reconstituted into proteoliposomes that are relatively impermeable to cations. P-glycoprotein activity in the proteoliposomes was dependent on ATP hydrolysis since it was not observed with non-hydrolyzable analogs of ATP. Maximal ATP-dependent 86Rb+ uptake occurred at 50 nM gramicidin D and at 500 nM valinomycin thus possibly reflecting higher affinity of P-glycoprotein for gramicidin D. Nigericin, which does not participate in the multidrug resistance phenomenon, did not support an ATP-dependent uptake of 86Rb+. ATP hydrolysis increased the amount of 86RB+ transported into the proteoliposomes. Furthermore, preincubation of the proteoliposomes in the presence of gramicidin D and 86Rb+, allowing for maximal ATP-independent 86Rb+ uptake to occur, did not interfere with subsequent ATP-dependent uptake, indicating the latter to constitute an active transport mechanism. The ATP-dependent component of 86Rb+ uptake occurred neither with liposomes nor with proteoliposomes reconstituted with proteins extracted from sinusoidal vesicles that lack P-glycoprotein. The ATP-dependent uptake was blocked by the known inhibitors of the ATPase activity associated with P-glycoprotein, oligomycin and vanadate, as well as by its established substrates, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and the tripeptide N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal. Thus, the reconstituted P-glycoprotein catalyzes the ATP-dependent 86Rb+ uptake that appears to occur by an energy-dependent translocation of the 86Rb(+)-ionophore complex. In this case, the actual substrate of P-glycoprotein is the ionophore-cation complex, which is both hydrophobic and positively charged as are most of the substrates of P-glycoprotein. This is the first demonstration of transport of a naturally occurring polypeptide by proteoliposomes reconstituted with physiologically expressed P-glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1575380102,"Abstract CD34 is currently the only well defined human hematopoietic stem cell marker and is expressed on 1-4% of normal bone marrow cells. Putative binding sites for Ets proteins, a family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of cell differentiation and proliferation in many cell systems, are present in the 5'-flanking region of the CD34 gene. Some of these sites are in close proximity to binding sequences of the encoded product of the proto-oncogene c-myb, which regulates CD34 expression by interacting with the Myb binding sites. Here we demonstrate that Ets-2 (i) transactivates the CD34 promoter in rodent fibroblasts upon interaction with Ets binding sites and (ii) induces expression of CD34 mRNA and protein in the CD34- human glioblastoma T98G cells. Ets-2 and c-Myb transactivate the CD34 promoter independently because specific transactivation is abrogated by site-specific mutations of the binding sites or by competition with oligomers that include wild type but not mutated Myb or Ets binding sites. Ets-2 and c-Myb appear to have addictive effects on transactivation of the CD34 promoter and on induction of CD34 mRNA. Instead, CD34 surface protein levels might be induced synergistically, raising the possibility of a posttranslational mechanism of CD34 expression in cells constitutively expressing c-Myb and Ets-2."
https://openalex.org/W1493438883,"Interleukin-3 (IL-3) induces proliferation of immature myeloid cells and mast cells and prevents programmed cell death (apoptosis) in vitro. These activities are exerted through binding of IL-3 to specific, high affinity receptors that then initiate a series of intracellular signaling events. Among the earliest of these signaling events in an IL-3-dependent cell line such as 32Dcl3 are activation of one or more receptor-associated tyrosine kinases followed by activation of p21ras. In an effort to define the functional role of p21ras activation in mediating the effects of IL-3, we constructed a series of sublines of 32Dcl3 in which a dominant inhibitory mutant of Ha-ras (c-Ha-ras(Asn-17)) was expressed under the control of a steroid-inducible promoter. Steroid treatment (dexamethasone, 1 microM) specifically induced c-Ha-ras(Asn-17) protein and mRNA and blocked IL-3-induced accumulation of p21ras-GTP in 32Dcl3/p21rasN17 cell lines, but not in control cells. Dexamethasone slightly inhibited IL-3-dependent proliferation of control 32Dcl3 cell lines (to 80% of maximum), but it completely blocked proliferation of 32Dcl3/p21rasN17 cell lines and induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1. This proliferative block could be overcome by cotransfection with v-ras, and was reversible if dexamethasone was washed out. Cells arrested by c-Ha-ras(Asn-17) were viable in culture for > 2 weeks, despite their inability to proliferate. Notably, however, these cells remained dependent on IL-3 for viability and initiated apoptosis within 18 h of IL-3 deprivation. Finally, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced differentiation of 32Dcl3/p21rasN17 cells to neutrophils was not affected by steroid-induced expression of c-Ha-ras(Asn-17) and did not require removal of IL-3. These results suggest that IL-3-induced proliferation and maintenance of cell viability are either initiated through separate signal transduction pathways or require different degrees of p21ras activation. Similarly, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced neutrophil differentiation is not blocked by expression of c-Ha-ras(Asn-17)."
https://openalex.org/W1482595433,"Human small intestinal lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) is synthesized as a single-chain polypeptide precursor, prepro-LPH, that undergoes two sequential cleavage steps: the first in the endoplasmic reticulum to pro-LPH (215-kDa) and the second, following terminal glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus, to mature 160-kDa LPH (denoted LPH beta). The LPH beta molecule is subsequently targetted to the brush-border membrane. Characterization of the N-terminal profragment (denoted LPH alpha) of pro-LPH using an epitope-specific, anti-peptide polyclonal antibody reveals that LPH alpha (i) has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 100,000, (ii) is not associated with LPH beta after cleavage of pro-LPH has occurred, and (iii) is not transported to the cell surface or secreted into the extracellular medium. In biosynthetic labeling experiments, a clear precursor/product relationship could be demonstrated between pro-LPH and the LPH alpha and LPH beta polypeptides. Further, LPH alpha has a significantly shorter half-life than LPH beta. LPH alpha is neither N- nor O-glycosylated, despite the presence of 5 potential N-glycosylation sites. LPH alpha, which is rich in cysteine and hydrophobic amino acid residues, may fold rapidly into a tight and rigid globular domain in which carbohydrate attachment sites are no longer accessible to glycosyltransferases. When expressed independently in COS-1 cells, the LPH beta polypeptide forms a misfolded, transport-incompetent molecule. We propose a role for the LPH alpha domain within the pro-LPH molecule as an intramolecular chaperone during folding in the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1484573047,"The immunoglobulin mu heavy chain gene of mouse hybridoma cells is expressed in two forms, microseconds and microns, differing in their use of 3' exons. As for many other mammalian genes, mutations in the mu gene which prematurely terminate translation often have the effect of reducing the amount of these mu RNAs. To test the generality of this relationship, we selected mutant hybridoma cell lines defective in IgM production and searched both for translation termination mutations which do not reduce the amount of mu RNA as well as for mutants which show the more commonly observed reduction in mu RNA. As observed previously, the amount of microseconds RNA is normal in mutants terminating in the C mu 4 exon; by contrast the amount of microns RNA is reduced in these mutants, indicating that the effect of the mutation is influenced by some feature near the 3' end of the RNA. Mutations terminating translation in other C region exons have a graded effect on RNA content, ranging from 10% the normal level for termination in the C mu 3 exon down to 1% for termination in the C mu 2 exon. By contrast, a mutant cell line terminating in the leader exon contained 25% the normal amount of mu RNA, suggesting that translation past some point might be required to fully engage the RNA degradation process."
https://openalex.org/W1493806519,"DNA strand scission initiated by bleomycin is a multistep process. Three C-C or C-O bonds are broken, releasing base propenal, a nucleic base derivative with deoxyribose carbons 1-3. Either C-3'-(phosphate-O) cleavage or C-3'-C-4' plus C-1'-(ring-O) bond cleavages could cause strand cleavage. To determine the sequence of bond breakage, d(CAAGCTTG) duplex was examined for rates of 1) strand scission, monitored by the hyperchromicity of cleavage-induced denaturation; 2) base propenal formation, monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy; 3) 5'-terminal phosphomonoester formation, monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy. Strand scission occurred with t 1/2 = 4.1 +/- 0.5 min at 4 degrees C, faster than base propenal formation (t 1/2 = 6.7 +/- 0.3 min). Thus newly cleaved DNA includes a base propenal precursor (t 1/2 = 2-3 min). The 5'-phosphate terminus forms (t 1/2 = 7.4 +/- 0.8 min) concurrently with base propenal. Since strand scission precedes phosphomonoester formation, strand scission cannot arise from C-3'-(phosphate-O) cleavage. Instead, the base propenal precursor must be linked to the future 5'-phosphate terminus, with strand scission arising from a combination of C-3'-C-4' and C-1'-(ring-O) bond cleavages. These results provide experimental support for a recently proposed mechanism that accommodates an early oxygen attack at C-4' and 2'-deprotonation without requiring simultaneous strand scission and 5'-phosphate terminus formation."
https://openalex.org/W1516802713,"When single rat hepatocytes were stimulated with the phospholipase C-activating hormone, vasopressin (from 300 pM to 1 microM), the [Ca2+]i signals were always responses. At low concentrations of vasopressin, Ca2+ release was maximal because liberation of additional inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) by photolysis of its caged precursor at the top of the [Ca2+]i spike failed to increase [Ca2+]i further. However, if IP3 was generated by photolysis of caged IP3 in previously unstimulated cells, [Ca2+]i increased immediately, and the magnitude of the response was a graded function of the quantity of IP3 released. We also analyzed the kinetics of activation of intracellular IP3 receptor/Ca2+ channels by monitoring the quench of sequestered dye by the entry of cytoplasmic Mn2+ into fura-2-loaded intracellular IP3-sensitive organelles. This Mn(2+)-induced quench was precipitous and always preceded by a delay inversely related to the vasopressin concentration. In hepatocytes stimulated with 10 nM vasopressin, IP3 increased slowly, and the half-time of the IP3 rise was comparable with the latency for the release of intracellular calcium. The slow rise in IP3 would be predicted to produce accelerating Ca2+ release. This is consistent with the results of the Mn2+ quench experiments, which revealed accelerating activation of intracellular IP3-regulated calcium channels. We conclude that this accelerating release of Ca2+, which does not occur with instantaneous increases in IP3 due to flash photolysis, is likely to be important for generating the all-or-none Ca2+ mobilization that initiates the processes of intracellular [Ca2+]i oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W1548697318,"12(R)-Hydroxy-5,8,14(Z,Z,Z)-eicosatrienoic acid (12(R)-HETrE) is an arachidonic acid metabolite formed by the corneal epithelium of several species, porcine leukocytes, and human and rat epidermal cells. It is a potent, stereospecific proinflammatory and angiogenic factor and its synthesis is increased manyfold in inflamed tissues, e.g. cornea and skin. It is possible that the angiogenic activity of 12(R)-HETrE is due to a direct mitogenic effect on microvessel endothelial cells via yet to be elucidated cellular and molecular mechanisms. In the present study, we demonstrated the ability of 12(R)-HETrE to stimulate the growth of quiescent endothelial cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with a maximal effect at 0.1 nM. This effect was highly stereospecific since its enantiomer, 12(S)-HETrE, had no effect within the same concentration range. Northern blot analysis and transient transfection experiments with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs of oncogene promoter regions demonstrated significant increases over control (0.5% fetal calf serum) in c-myc-, c-jun, and c-fos mRNA levels and expression in cells treated with 0.1 nM 12(R)-HETrE. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of nuclear protein extracts from cells treated with 12(R)-HETrE with specific radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to known transcriptional binding sites, including AP-1, AP-2, SP1, TRE, NF kappa B, TFIID, OKT1, CREB, CTF/NF1, and GRE demonstrated a markedly rapid and specific increase in the binding activity of NF kappa B and to a lesser extent, AP-1. No significant increase was observed in the binding of other transcription factors assayed as compared to control (untreated) cells. Since the protooncogenes (c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc) are immediate early response genes that are implicated in the process of cell proliferation and differentiation, and activation of certain transcription factors, in particular NF kappa B, is associated with the immediate response of the cell to an injury, we propose that 12(R)HETrE's mitogenic and angiogenic activities are mediated, in part, via the activation of NF kappa B and expression of these protooncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W1591499783,"Thrombomodulin (TM) is an anionic (pI approximately 4) protein cofactor that promotes thrombin (THR) cleavage of protein C to generate activated protein C (APC), a potent anticoagulant. We find that the cationic platelet alpha-granule protein platelet factor 4 (PF4) stimulates 4-25-fold the cofactor activity of rabbit TM and two differentially glycanated versions of an extracellular domain human TM polypeptide in which the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) is either present (GAG+ TM) or absent (GAG- TM) with an ED50 of 3.3-10 micrograms/ml. No such stimulation occurs in response to beta-thromboglobulin or thrombospondin, or when protein C lacking its gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain is the substrate. Heparin and chondroitin sulfates A and E reverse PF4 stimulation. PF4 minimally affects the Kd for THR but decreases 30-fold (from 8.3 to 0.3 microM) the Km for protein C of APC generation by GAG+ TM. PF4 also strikingly transforms the [Ca2+] dependence profile of rabbit and GAG+ TM to resemble that of GAG- TM. A potential explanation for this is that PF4, like Ca2+, induces heparin-reversible alterations in native (but not Gla-domainless) protein C conformation as assessed by autofluorescence emission analysis. We conclude that PF4 stimulates TM APC generation by interacting electrostatically with both the TM GAG and the protein C Gla domain to enhance markedly the affinity of the THR.TM complex for protein C. By this mechanism, PF4 may play a previously unsuspected role in the physiologic regulation of clotting."
https://openalex.org/W1603194717,"Since early growth response-1 (Egr-1) is required for macrophage differentiation and nitric oxide (NO) is immunosuppressive, we hypothesized that NO would reduce Egr-1 expression in rat lung macrophages. The inflammatory stimuli interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide induced an early, transient increase in Egr-1 mRNA (> 5-fold at 2 h) and a sustained, high level of inducible NO synthase mRNA (> 100-fold from 4 to 24 h). The NO metabolites nitrite and nitrate rose > 10-fold in medium from stimulated versus unstimulated cells over 24 h. Concomitant with elevated nitrogen oxides, Egr-1 mRNA levels declined to 80% below unstimulated cells at 24 h. This decline was blocked by an inhibitor of NO production, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Further, the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine inhibited Egr-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner, producing complete inhibition at 0.5 mM. The effect of S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine was not due to reduced macrophage viability. We conclude that Egr-1 induction precedes inducible NO synthase induction in stimulated rat macrophages and that subsequent NO production reduces macrophage expression of Egr-1. We propose that this mechanism is used to regulate macrophage differentiation in human immunodeficiency virus infection and other inflammatory states."
https://openalex.org/W1562490575,"Interferons (IFNs), as well as some interleukins, growth factors, and hormones, all induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and additional transcription factors of similar sizes. These factors are activated to translocate to nucleus and bind to enhancers of consensus sequence TTnCnnnAA (gamma-IFN activated sequence-like enhancers). In mammary cells or hybridoma B9 cells, four distinct tyrosine-phosphorylated transcription complexes activated by interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IFN-beta were observed: pIRFA and complexes I, II, and III (of increasing electrophoretic mobility). The factors have unequal affinities for enhancers of different genes; they are activated with distinct kinetics and to different extents by IL-6 and IFNs. The pIRFA band isolated from IL-6-stimulated B9 hybridoma cells revealed three DNA-interacting components: two large subunits of 91 and 98 kDa, as well as a small component of 46 kDa not seen in other complexes analyzed. One of the large pIRFA subunits may be APRF/STAT3, since pIRFA reacted with anti-APRF antibodies as do complexes I and II. However, pIRFA did not react with antibodies to STAT1, indicating STAT1 is not the other large component of pIRFA. Complex II, which reacted to anti-acute phase response factor antibodies also reacted to anti-STAT1 antibodies, whereas complex III reacted only to anti-STAT1 and was the only complex resistant to N-ethylmaleimide. By its multimeric subunit structure and its cytokine and enhancer sequence specificities, the slowly migrating pIRFA band appears as a novel tyrosine-phosphorylated transcription complex acting on a subset of gamma-IFN activated sequence-like enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W1584992409,"To examine the function of the thumb subdomain in bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase we constructed a set of deletion mutants within this subdomain. These mutants exhibited reduced processivity during the processive, but not the abortive, stage of transcription. Reduced processivity was found to be due primarily to an increase in the processive ternary complex dissociation rate (destabilization of the processive ternary complex). The destabilization of the ternary complex does not appear to be due to a decrease in the affinity of the polymerase for the nascent RNA. These observations support the proposal that the thumb subdomain functions to stabilize the processive ternary complex during the processive (but not the abortive) stage of transcription, probably by wrapping around the template to prevent polymerase dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1607003276,"The CD59 antigen is a plasma membrane glycoprotein that serves as an inhibitor of the C5b-9 complex of complement. This inhibitory activity appears related to the capacity of CD59 to bind with high affinity to sites that are nascently exposed in the alpha-chain subunit of human C8, as well as within the C9b domain (amino acid residues 245-538) of human C9, during assembly of the C5b-9 complex on the target membrane (Ninomiya, H., and Sims, P. J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13675-13680). The CD59 binding site in C9 was first investigated by N-terminal sequencing of CD59-binding peptides generated by limited digest of the isolated C9b domain. These experiments revealed a 17-kDa fragment (starting at C9 residue Thr-320) that retained affinity for CD59, suggesting the possibility for localizing the CD59 binding site by mapping with small C9-derived peptides. Peptides spanning the entire C9b sequence were expressed in Escherichia coli and then probed with CD59. CD59 bound specifically to all peptides starting N-terminal to C9 residue 359 with C termini extending beyond residue 411. Little to no CD59 binding was observed for various C9-derived peptides that started C-terminal to residue 359 or that were truncated N-terminal to residue 411. Affinity-purified antibody against C9 residues 320-411 inhibited CD59 binding to C9 by > 50% and completely inhibited its binding to the isolated C9b domain. Little to no specific binding of CD59 was detected for peptides restricted to the putative hinge domain within C9b (residues 245-271). These results indicate that a CD59 binding site is located between residues 320 and 411 of the C9 polypeptide and suggest that the affinity of this site is principally determined by residues 359-411."
https://openalex.org/W1667656237,"The endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (ec-NOS) is targeted to the particulate subcellular fraction by means of N-terminal myristoylation. However, the association of ecNOS with the particulate subcellular fraction appears to be dynamically regulated, in that agonist treatment of endothelial cells induces translocation of the enzyme from membrane to cytosol (Michel, T., Li, G., and Busconi, L. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 6252-6255). cDNA encoding wild-type and myristoylation-deficient mutant (myr-) ecNOS was transcribed and translated in vitro, and we found that the recombinant wild-type but not the myr- mutant protein undergoes myristoylation and is able to associate with biological membranes prepared from diverse cell sources. Treatment of these cell membranes with heat or with trypsin did not affect their ability subsequently to serve as acceptor membranes for the wild-type recombinant enzyme. The wild-type ecNOS, but not the myr- mutant, is able to form stable associations with phospholipid liposomes. We also explored the possibility that a polybasic domain within the ecNOS protein might serve as a secondary structural determinant for ecNOS membrane association and constructed truncation mutants that flank a polybasic domain present in the ecNOS. These truncation mutants, transcribed and translated in vitro or transfected into COS-7 cells, undergo myristoylation and are able to associate with biological membranes in a fashion indistinguishable from the wild type ecNOS. Taken together, these results indicate that ecNOS binding to biological membranes is dependent upon interactions of the N-terminal myristoyl moiety of ecNOS with lipid components of the membrane, and this association does not require a specific membrane protein functioning as a myristate receptor nor the presence of a polybasic domain within the ecNOS."
https://openalex.org/W1512996606,"We have used a panel of monoclonal antibodies and a cell-free transcription assay to study the function of the tau 1 transactivation domain of the human glucocorticoid receptor. Three antibodies (monoclonal antibodies 250, 275, and 286) specifically inhibited tau 1-dependent transcription, but had little or no effect on either basal transcription or the activity of an unrelated yeast transcription factor. This inhibition was not due to interference of DNA binding activity, as all three antibodies super shifted tau 1-containing protein-DNA complexes. Epitopes for all three antibodies were localized to a region between amino acids 190 and 200, which lies within the recently defined 41-amino acid core region of tau 1 that is required for transactivation (Dahlman-Wright, K., Almlof, T., McEwan, I.J., Gustafsson, J-A., and Wright, A. P.H. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 1619-1623). In contrast to the effect on tau 1-dependent transcription none of the antibodies tested antagonized the squelching ability of the tau 1 domain, suggesting that tau 1-mediated transactivation involves interactions in addition to those identified by the squelching assay. Consistent with this, a comparison of the kinetics of tau 1 squelching and inhibition of transactivation by monoclonal antibodies suggested a role for tau 1 mediated transcriptional induction at two or more steps during transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1499581607,"DNA(cytosine-5)-methylases form tight complexes at their methylation sites when the target cytosine residue is substituted by analogs such as 5-azacytosine or 5-fluorocytosine. To test whether such complexes can block RNA transcription in vitro, template DNA-containing methylation sites were prepared, in which cytosine residues in either the (+)- or (-)-strand were substituted by the analogs. Such templates, irrespective of the strand in which substitution was made, could effectively block the elongation of RNA at specific sites when complexed with EcoRII methylase. The protein-DNA complex probably prevents the unwinding of the template strands or might directly present itself as a steric block to the advancing RNA polymerase. RNA synthesis was also inhibited at specific sites due to complex formation between azacytosine-containing DNA and two other methylases, HhaI and HpaII. The 3' ends of the interrupted transcripts were mapped and were found to lie within 13-14, 13, and 23 nucleotides of the binding sites on the (-)-strand for HhaI, HpaII, and EcoRII methylases, respectively. Exonuclease III footprinting revealed that the boundaries of the complexed methylases, HhaI, HpaII, and EcoRII, on the (-)-strand were within 2-3, 1-2, and 9-10 nucleotides, respectively, of the last nucleotide copied by the RNA polymerase."

To investigate the structure of intestinal gamma GT RNA in greater detail, we cloned and sequenced mouse intestinal gamma GT cDNAs. Seven of eight informative clones were Type VI and consisted of Type VI unique exons, VIa and VIb (as described previously by us) (Rajagopalan, S., Wan, D.-F., Habib, G. M., Sepulveda, A.

Exon VIb contains two alternative splice acceptors, one previously identified by us and the other 17 bases 5' of this site. Another clone contained a previously unidentified gamma GT mRNA designated as Type VII. Type VII consists of a unique 5' exon which is 315 base pairs upstream of the exon VIa splice donor site and is spliced to exon VIb. Regulation of gamma GT expression in the small intestine is complex and involves at least three previously described promoters, alternative splicing, and a previously undescribed exonic sequence (Type VII RNA) 5' of promoter VI."
https://openalex.org/W2401476584,"Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are heterotrimers of heavy chains, beta 2-microglobulin, and 8-10 amino acid-long peptides. Assembly of class I MHC molecules into complexes which are stable and can be transported to the cell surface occurs soon after insertion of individual subunits into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To identify subcellular compartments required for class I MHC assembly, we studied class I biosynthesis in human cell lines treated with several inhibitors of intracellular transport. We found that HLA-B701 molecules do not assemble in CIR transfectants in which a block in protein transport from the ER is established by treatment with phosphatase inhibitors. In contrast, stable HLA-B701 complexes form in cells in which the ER becomes mixed with the Golgi after treatment with brefeldin A. Neither treatment impaired binding of HLA-B701 to the ER-resident protein calnexin, and unassembled heavy chains in phosphatase-inhibited cells showed prolonged association with calnexin. In addition, the mouse class I molecule H-2Db, which binds beta 2-microglobulin in human T2 cells in the absence of transporter of antigenic peptides, formed complexes in CIR cell transfectants treated with phosphatase inhibitors. Taken together, these data demonstrate that phosphatase inhibitors do not prevent assembly of class I heavy chain beta 2-microglobulin dimers, but instead interfere with peptide loading. These results are consistent with the possibility that class I MHC molecules are transported from their initial site of insertion into the rough ER before binding peptides, or alternatively that peptide loading mediated by transporter of antigenic peptides is blocked by phosphatase inhibitors."
